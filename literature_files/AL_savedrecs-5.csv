J,,,,,,,,,Richard Jardine,,ALPACA: Axial-Lateral Pile Analysis for Chalk Applying multi-scale field and laboratory testing,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Awarded Grant,Sep 30 2017,2017,"Chalk is a highly variable soft rock that covers much of Northern Europe and is widespread under the North and Baltic Seas. It poses significant problems for the designers of large foundations for port, bridge and offshore wind turbine structures that have to sustain severe environmental loading over their many decades in service. Particular difficulties are faced when employing large driven steel piles to secure the structures in place. While driven pile foundation solutions have many potential advantages, chalk is highly sensitive to pile driving and to service loading conditions, such as the repeated cyclic buffeting applied to bridge, harbour and offshore structures by storm winds and wave impacts. Current guidance regarding how to allow for difficult pile driving conditions or predict the piles' vertical and lateral response to loads is notoriously unreliable in chalk. There is also no current industrial guidance regarding the potentially positive effects of time (after driving) on pile behaviour or the generally negative impact of the cyclic loading that the structures and their piled foundations will inevitably experience. These shortfalls in knowledge are introducing great uncertainty into the assessment and design of a range of projects around the UK and Northern Europe. Particularly affected are a series of planned and existing major offshore wind farm developments. The uncertainty regarding foundation design and performance poses a threat to the economic and safe harnessing of vital renewable, low carbon, offshore energy supplies. Better design guidelines will reduce offshore wind energy costs and also help harbour and transport projects to progress and function effectively, so delivering additional benefits to both individual consumers and UK Industry.The research proposed will generate new driven pile design guidance for chalk sites through a comprehensive programme of high quality field tests, involving multiple loading scenarios, on 21 specially instrumented driven tubular steel test piles, at an onshore test site in Kent. This will form a benchmark set of results that will be complemented by comprehensive advanced drilling, sampling, in-situ testing and laboratory experiments, supported by rigorous analysis and close analysis of other case history data. The key aim is to develop design procedures that overcome, for chalk, the current shortfalls in knowledge regarding pile driving, ageing, static and cyclic response under axial and lateral loading. The main deliverable will be new guidelines for practical design that will be suitable for both onshore and offshore applications.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,EP/P033091/1,,,,,,,,Imperial College London,,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:15403029,,

We experimentally assessed the relationship between infauna abundance and richness with increased distance (0, 5, 25, 50, 100 and 300 m) from reefballs deployed on a flat and homogeneous bottom, 9-m deep, on the north coast of Rio de Janeiro, south-eastern Brazil. Benthic taxon richness and abundance varied significantly between surveys with higher values in February 2007. Both numerical indicators changed similarly with distance, but more noticeably between 300 m and the other distance treatments where abundance was highest. A non-metric multidimensional scaling ordination revealed that macrobenthic assemblages were very heterogeneous with significant differences between surveys but not among sampling distances. A canonical correspondence analysis including species, distances and sediment variables showed that the distances 5, 25 and 100 m were related to organic matter and mud (fine sediment), while 0 and 300 m distances were more related to the non-organic variables, such as the percentage of gravel, sand and calcium carbonate. Spatial variations in the parameters of the sediment alone did not explain the distribution of the associated infauna, given the similarity of the community at different distances. It is suggested that the influence of artificial reefs is quickly dissipated due to strong bottom sea currents, indicating a reduced impact or influence of these reefs on the surrounding infauna.",,,,,,,,,9,1,0,0,7,0,11,,,0025-3154,1469-7769,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Estadual Norte Fluminense, Ctr Biociencias & Biotecnol, BR-28013602 Campos Dos Goytacazes, RJ, BrazilUniv Vale Itajai, CTTMAR, BR-88302130 Itajai, SC, Brazil",,,,2012-09-01,WOS:000308312900006,,

Due to its increasing portion of generation mix, wind farms are expected to play the role similar to the traditional power plants. Down the road toward this goal, the intermittency and uncertainty of wind are the two important factors that should be solved. Today, storage systems present a very interesting alternative to deal with the wind variability. Among various storage types, the hydrogen system is showing a promising future due to the high storage efficiency, low emissions, and wide applications. This paper presents a new coordination control scheme between the offshore wind farm and a hydrogen management system (HMS) for reducing the adverse impacts of wind variability. In the proposed scheme, the HMS is situated onshore to provide medium-to long-term energy balancing service. A supercapacitor bank is supplemented to the system for providing the short-term transient compensation. System configuration and control strategies are also presented. Simulation tests were conducted to verify the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed control.

We characterized nocturnal bird migration along the Pacific side of the isthmus with marine radar, and identified species with diurnal point counts during 5 fall seasons (2009-2013) at operational and proposed wind farms. We found significant differences in migratory traffic rates, flight directions, and flight altitudes among years and sites, but we also found patterns of similarity including flight directions heading to the southeast each season; migratory traffic rates peaking 3-4 h after sunset and decreasing thereafter; flight altitudes increasing throughout the night; seasonal mean flight altitudes fluctuating between 520 and 720 m above ground level (m agl); and <7% of detected targets flying below 100 m agl.

Acoust. Sec, of Am., 100, pt2, 2732 (1996)]. The array output gives three-dimensional images with thousands of independent pixels for any chosen look direction and so can provide both horizontal and vertical directivity patterns. This system uses the natural broadband characteristics of ambient noise using a multiplicative processing of the cross-correlations between the receivers, similar to Class I T.A.P arrays. The sonar has already been used in a variety of experiments to probe the ocean environment in shallow waters off the coast of Florida. Although there have been many measurements made of ambient noise levels in shallow water there appear to be very few published results of the ambient noise horizontal directivity. More recently there have been a number of experiments on near-shore ambient noise and these have shown the importance of biological activity in low sea states and breaking waves in high sea states. The results found with the ANS indicate that in tropical waters and in low sea states the noise is highly anisotropic and is generated by biological noise sources and not breaking waves, contrary to the standard assumption that the noise is surface generated and isotropic. Colonies of snapping shrimp have been localized along the coast, clustered around man-made structures and natural reefs. Noise measurements from these biological sources were used to create noise maps of the near-shore region, which were evaluated with further measurements to validate the propagation model. Finally, by monitoring local boat traffic, the ANS used boat noise as a source of opportunity to probe the environment and obtain an estimate of the bottom reflection coefficient. The measurement of the vertical arrival structure from boat noise can also indicate the presence of a sound velocity profile.",,,,,IEEE OCEANS Conference and Exhibition on Engineering for Sustainable Use of the Oceans (OCEANS 98)IEEE OCEANS Conference and Exhibition on Engineering for Sustainable Use of the Oceans (OCEANS 98),"SEP 28-OCT 01, 1998SEP 28-OCT 01, 1998",IEEE; IEEE Ocean Engn SocIEEE; IEEE Ocean Engn Soc,"NICE, FRANCENICE, FRANCE",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,0-7803-5045-6,,,,,,,,,"Florida Atlantic Univ, Dept Ocean Engn, Boca Raton, FL 33431 USA",,,,1998-01-01,WOS:000078340800272,,

The northeast Atlantic is a hotspot of Undaria invasion, yet there is limited knowledge on its invasion dynamics. In the UK its distribution is strongly associated with artificial structures, primarily marina and harbour pontoons, with relatively few records of Undaria on natural substrates. Here, the southwest UK is used as a case region, to explicitly link Undaria distribution-abundance patterns in artificial marina habitats with those in natural rocky reef habitats. Using a mixture of in situ recording and video survey techniques, Undaria was found at all thirteen marina sites surveyed; but in only 17 of 35 rocky reef sites, all of which were in 2 of the 5 larger systems surveyed (Plymouth Sound and Torbay). The distribution-abundance patterns of Undaria at reef sites were analysed using zero-inflated models. The probability of finding Undaria on rocky reef increased with increasing proximity to marinas with high abundances of Undaria. Total propagule pressure from marinas also increased the probability of occurrence, and was positively related to Undaria abundance and cover at reef sites. Increases in the cover of native kelps, Laminaria spp., and wave exposure at reef sites were linked to a reduced probability of Undaria occurrence, and lower abundance and cover. Identifying high risk areas, natural boundaries and factors affecting the spread and abundance of non-native species in natural habitats is key to future management prioritisation. Where Undaria is confined to artificial substrates management may be deemed a low priority. However, the results of this study suggest that controlling the abundance and propagule pressure in artificial habitats may limit, to some extent, the spillover of Undaria into natural rocky reef habitats, where it has the potential to interact with and influence native communities.",,,,,,,,,23,0,0,0,20,0,23,,,1387-3547,1573-1464,,,,,,,,,,"Marine Biol Assoc UK, Citadel Hill, Plymouth PL1 2PB, Devon, EnglandUniv Southampton, Natl Oceanog Ctr Southampton, Ocean & Earth Sci, Waterfront Campus,European Way, Southampton SO14 3ZH, Hants, England",,,,2018-04-01,WOS:000428955000016,31258384,

In Eilat (Red Sea), artificial reefs constructed for attractive diving are frequently fouled by ascidians. In this study we examined aspects of temporal and spatial fouling of two common ascidians, Didemnum granulatum and Didemnum sp., on two modular experimental artificial reefs. Habitat partitioning, growth rate and survivorship of the two species were monitored along these artificial reefs for 1 yr. D. granulatum was the first ascidian to appear, and the most prominent species on both artificial reefs. Its initial recruitment was on the lower sides of the deepest horizontal plates of both artificial reefs, and it gradually recruited towards the lower sides of the shallower horizontal plates. Didemnum sp. colonies recruited at different depths along the artificial reef, while following a similar pattern of gradual recruitment towards the shallower plates. Both species successfully foul on the artificial reefs prior to the appearance of long lived organisms such as corals. Transplantation experiments further confirmed the depth and position required by D. granulatum along the artificial reefs. We suggest that the initial recruitment of D. granulatum on the lower sides of the deepest horizontal plates is an outcome of its negatively phototactic and geotropic bottom swimming larvae, which are able to delay settlement in order to locate a suitable settlement site.",,,,,,,,,21,1,0,0,20,3,26,,,0007-4977,1553-6955,,,,,,,,,,"Tel Aviv Univ, George S Wise Fac Life Sci, Dept Zool, IL-69978 Tel Aviv, Israel",,,,1998-07-01,WOS:000077247600016,,

The ostensible rationale for this approach is that when the artificial reef fish assemblage increases in a given area, the component target species will also increase. This premise also implies that the target species is characteristically reef- or structure-associated. Targeted species may not be niche-specific with regard to their association with reef attributes; however, trophic groups may be niche generalists for a suite of reef attributes. Artificial reef designs could be directed toward trophic groups and not individual species or the entire assemblage. This would allow more efficient optimization of artificial reef designs directed toward generalized life history features common among species within a trophic group. The delineation of species according to reef niche should include attributes based on trophic features that will allow optimal management through trophic-group-oriented artificial reef deployments. If successful, trophic groups within an assemblage could be more efficiently managed to allow the full integration of artificial reefs into fisheries management on a worldwide basis.

Human population growth in coastal areas, including estuaries, is expected to increase considerably in coming decades, which will result in a proliferation of infrastructure such as jetties, wharfs and marinas. This infrastructure is often associated with artificial night lighting, yet the implications of these unnatural lighting regimes for the fish fauna in coastal ecosystems are unknown. We conducted novel, night-time surveys of the fish community directly adjacent to an artificial structure using an acoustic camera (didson). By manipulating the artificial lighting conditions (lighting either on' or off'), we tested the effects of artificial light on fish abundance and behaviour. Clear differences in the abundance of fish were observed between the two light treatments. The occurrence of large-bodied predators (>500mm TL) increased when the artificial lights were on. The behaviour of these fish also differed as they attempted to maintain their position within the illuminated area adjacent to the associated anthropogenic structure. The abundance of small shoaling fish also increased when the lights were on. It is possible that the conditions created by artificial lighting benefit piscivores through the concentration of prey and enhanced foraging capabilities in the case of visual predators. This has the potential to create unnatural topdown regulation of fish populations within urban estuarine and coastal waters. Synthesis and applications. As a consequence of a positive phototaxic response, the findings of this study suggest that artificial light often associated with man-made structures has the potential to alter fish communities within urban estuarine ecosystems by creating optimal conditions for predators. Future coastal developments should consider the ecological implications of lighting on aquatic communities.

However, most of it remains untapped at the same time as ca 240 million people lack access to electricity in the country (19% of the total population). This calls for a thorough estimation of the amount of wind energy that could be technically and economically seized to assess the potential penetration of wind power into the country's energy system. The utilization of wind energy is associated with a plethora of localization criteria and thus it should be systematically addressed by spatial assessments to guarantee its harmonization with socio-economic systems, infrastructure and ecosystems. This study focuses on onshore wind power and strives to provide with estimates of techno economic potential based on state of the art wind power technology. Socio-economic, geographical and technical criteria regarding the localization of wind farms are outlined and implemented through a detailed a Geographic Information Systems (GIS) analysis. The levelized cost of wind generated electricity is then calculated geospatially. According to this assessment there are several states that signify high yearly wind energy yield, such as Rajasthan, Andhra Pradesh and Gujarat, whilst Goa and other states indicate the least or negligible wind power potential. The levelized cost of generating electricity ranges between 57 and 100 USD/MWh, which places wind power in a competitive position in the Indian electricity market. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Traditional methods such as trawls are usually inefficient even over reef habitats with relatively small (<1 m) relief. Artificial reefs offer an alternative method for the study of juvenile reef fishes as this information is essential in the effective management of benthic fisheries. If juvenile reef fishes can be attracted to artificial reefs, it is possible to use artificial reefs as part of the sampling method to study these important early stages. For example, the juvenile life stage of the recreationally and commercially important red snapper, Lutjanus campechanus (Poey 1860), from the northern Gulf of Mexico has received considerable attention because high mortalities during these stages are associated with later year classes. However, most abundance estimates of age 0-1 red snapper are based on trawl surveys, but as shown here, juvenile red snapper quickly become associated with reef structure during their first month or two of life, suggesting that juvenile abundance estimates using trawls may have both low precision and accuracy. Consistently high densities over several years of new recruits to artificial reefs (even in years of low adult red snapper abundance) and the lack of any increase in new recruit densities (even after significant shrimp trawl bycatch reduction, in recent years) indicates that early postsettlement processes influence subsequent red snapper year class strength. These conclusions are based on diver surveys of artificial reefs as opposed to traditional trawl sampling. The increased use of sampling juvenile reef fishes with artificial reefs as the sampling tool could provide new insight into the ecology and management of important reef fish species.The various limitations and ecological bottlenecks of marine reef fishes have been extensively studied, with the greatest effort directed at coral reef fishes (e.g., Sale, 1991, 2002). Despite this effort, it is still unclear as to the relative contributions of environmental limitations on early life larval (Doherty, 1991, 2002) or postsettlement juvenile mortality limitations on subsequent adult reef-fish populations (Jones, 1991; Hixon, 1991; Hixon and Webster, 2002). This discussion continues (Armsworth, 2002; Anderson et al., 2007; Caddy, 2008; Oeberst et al., 2009) and is applicable to population regulation questions concerning red snapper stocks in the northern Gulf of Mexico. What has received less attention is the use of artificial reefs in the study of red snapper and their possible utility in defining the functioning mechanisms that affect red snapper stocks (Gallaway et al., 2009; Shipp and Bortone, 2009).

The comprehensive evaluation of ecological effect of artificial reefs should include the effects on the components of the ecosystem, embodied in the flow field, water quality and sediment, food organisms level, macroinvertebrate community structure and other indicators on. In order to fully evaluate the effect produced by artificial reefs, Haizhou Bay was selected as the study area. Since the delivery of artificial reefs in 2003, the ecological environment of Haizhou Bay has been significantly improved, with plankton community structure changed greatly, biomass increased significantly, large benthic biomass and habitat density increased year by year, and the proliferation of fish and macroinvertebrates became more and more. Based on data collected during the biological resource and environment survey in Haizhou Bay from Sept. 2012 to Aug. 2013, an integrative evaluation of the ecological effect of artificial reefs with entropy-weighted fuzzy matter-element method was constructed. We use the concept of Euclid approach degree, with the entropy method and fuzzy matter-element combination, to provide practical basis for the conservation of fishery resources in the waters. In the evaluation system, we combined three grades of evaluation standards with the survey data to evaluate the ecological effect of the artificial reef area. The results indicated that the comprehensive ecological effect of artificial reef area was superior to the control area, and both of them were higher than level I. The water quality and bottom sediment condition of artificial reef area was higher than those of control area, and both were far better than level I. The delivery of artificial reefs played a certain improvement on water quality and sediment in study area. The level of food organism in artificial reef area was slightly better than that of control area, and both were around level III. The artificial reefs had a certain influence on food organisms, but the evaluation showed that the level of fish food organisms reef area has not yet reached the optimum. The level of fish and large invertebrates in artificial reef area was much higher than that of control area, and the former was higher than level I while the latter was at level II. The results indicated that the ecological effect of artificial reef area in Haizhou Bay was obvious. The method was effective for the evaluation of ecological effect of artificial reefs. When this method is used to evaluate the ecological effect of artificial reefs, the index can be re-screened based on the reef types to adjust the evaluation grade standards.

Artificial shading has been highlighted as an important human disturbance, affecting both productivity and community organization. However, studies of shading have been poorly explored from an environmental impact perspective.2. We compared community structure on subtropical rocky shores in areas shaded by human constructions with those in unshaded areas. We then implemented a manipulative field experiment to determine the effects of shading on the macrobenthic community, biofilm biomass and larval recruitment.3. Shading consistently affected the biological community of rocky shores. The biomass and cover of macroalgae and the size of most sedentary grazers were smaller in shaded habitat. In the infralittoral fringe, we recorded a shift in dominance from macroalgae in unshaded habitats to invertebrate filter feeders in shaded ones. In a similar way, the community from the mesolittoral was also affected by shading but not at all locations.4. Experimental manipulation of shading led to a total loss of macroalgae from the infralittoral fringe and no community replacement over a period of 220 days. In the mesolittoral, oysters became more abundant in shaded conditions, while barnacles decreased in abundance. Larval recruitment was also affected, with oysters and barnacles recruiting more in shaded habitats.5. Synthesis and applications. We demonstrate a clear impact of shading by artificial humanmade structures on patterns and processes regulating biodiversity on rocky shores and thus consequences for coastal ecosystem functioning. We argue that shading by artificial coastal structures, such as those proposed in the port expansion in our study site in south-eastern Brazil, is potentially underestimated. Our work emphasizes the importance of careful evaluations of artificial structures in order to promote sustainable coastal development. As a result, we do not recommend the proposed expansion by suspended structures of the port of Sao Sebastiao, as the consequent shading will negatively affect the biodiversity and ecosystem functioning of the Araca Bay and surrounding areas.",,,,,,,,,27,0,0,0,21,2,27,,,0021-8901,1365-2664,,,,,,,,,,"Fed Univ ABC CCNH UFABC, Ctr Nat & Human Sci, Rua Santa Adelia 166, BR-09210170 Santo Andre, SP, BrazilFed Univ Sao Paulo IMar UNIFESP, Inst Marine Sci, Rua Dr Carvalho de Mendonca 144, BR-11070100 Santos, SP, BrazilBangor Univ, Sch Ocean Sci, Menai Bridge LL59 5AB, Anglesey, WalesUniv Sao Paulo CEBIMar USP, Ctr Marine Biol, Rod Manoel Hipolito Rego,Km131,5, BR-1160000 Sao Sebastiao, SP, Brazil",Fed Univ ABC CCNH UFABCUniv Sao Paulo CEBIMar USP,,,2017-06-01,WOS:000401239100016,,

Even though evaluation studies about the efficacy of artificial reefs are plentiful in the rest of the Mediterranean (Central and Western), in the Eastern Basin they are largely absent. As the Eastern part of the Mediterranean Sea is characterised by unique physical parameters, the necessity to study artificial reefs under these contrasting regimes increases. The epibenthic communities of two unintentional artificial reefs (modern shipwrecks) in Cyprus (Zenobia) and Lebanon (Alice-B) were evaluated in 2010. Both shipwrecks are at similar depth, type of sea bottom, made of the same material (steel) and were sunk approximately the same period of time. However, Alice-B shipwreck off the coast of Lebanon is constantly exposed to higher levels of nutrients than Zenobia in Cyprus. Significant dissimilarities were observed in the composition, percentage of benthic cover of predominant taxonomic groups and development of the epibenthic communities. Differences in physical and chemical parameters between sides lay mainly in the nutrient and thermal regimes affecting the shipwrecks and most likely bring about the differences in the observed community structure. The results of this study suggest that epibenthic communities could be highly impacted by eutrophication caused by anthropogenic activities, leading to less biodiverse communities dominated by specific species that are favoured by the eutrophic conditions.

These protected [long dash] and no-take areas [long dash] were created between 1980 and 1983. They have been fully protected since their establishment, except in 2004 when anthropic activities (except commercial fishing) were exceptionally authorized. Moreover, there have been no park rangers to prevent poaching since 2002. To carry out long-term monitoring of the marine organism [long dash] mainly fish [long dash] assemblages established in the artificial reefs, underwater visual censuses (UVC) were carried out in 1987/1989, 1998/2000, and 2008, according to a standardized method. All the fish species present on the artificial reefs were considered to assess density and biomass, but this method is time-consuming (divers formation to UVC techniques). In 2008, in addition to the traditional UVC, a new sampling procedure of the fish assemblages, the FAST method (Fish Assemblage Sampling Technique) was tested. With this method, sampling is based on the presence/absence of a number of given species. This list of species includes only species of interest for commercial and noncommercial fishing. A comparison of the UVC monitoring shows that density of the fish assemblages increased in the first 10 years, then did not increase during the last decade. These results can be explained by a lack of watching within the protected areas to prevent poaching since 2002 and to the reopening to the anthropic activities in 2004. The real efficiency of the artificial reefs to restore or sustain fish assemblages is then discussed.

This demand requires a huge volume of cement production that could cause an ecological issue such as increasing the rates of CO2 emissions in the atmosphere. This motivated several scholars to search for various alternatives for cement and one of such alternatives is called sulfur-based concrete. This concrete composite contributes to reduce the amount of cement required to make conventional concrete. Sulfur can be used as a partial-alternate binder to Ordinary Portland Cement (OPC) to produce sulfur-based concrete, which is a composite matrix of construction materials collected mostly from aggregates and sulfur. Sulfur modified concrete outperforms conventional concrete in terms of rapid gain of early strength, low shrinkage, low thermal conductivity, high durability resistance and excellent adhesion. On the basis of mentioned superior characteristics of sulfur-based concrete, it can be applied as a leading construction material for underground utility systems, dams and offshore structures. Therefore, this study reviews the sources, emissions from construction enterprises and compositions of sulfur; describes the production techniques and properties of sulfur; and highlights related literature to generate comprehensive insights into the potential applications of sulfur-based concrete in the construction industry today.",,,,,,,,,29,0,3,0,0,0,32,,,,1996-1944,,,,,,,,,,"Far Eastern Fed Univ, Dept Hydraul Engn & Theory Construct, Vladivostok 690091, RussiaPrince Sattam Bin Abdulaziz Univ, Coll Engn, Dept Civil Engn, Alkharj 11942, Saudi ArabiaAmran Univ, Fac Engn & IT, Dept Civil Engn, Amran 9677, Quhal, YemenCyprus Int Univ, Civil Engn Dept, TR-99258 Nicosia, North Cyprus, TurkeyUniv Putra Malaysia, Dept Civil Engn, Serdang 43400, MalaysiaBelgorod State Technol Univ, Dept Strength Mat & Struct Mech, Belgorod 308012, RussiaPeter Great St Petersburg Polytech Univ, Higher Sch Ind Civil & Rd Construct, St Petersburg 195251, Russia",Amran Univ,,,2020-12-01,WOS:000589684300001,33105753,

Alternative models were constructed to address the different hypotheses regarding the behaviour of top predator (whether the top predators will be scared away by the OWF or attracted by the reef effect), impacts of global warming and changes in fisheries activities. Key findings from these analyses are that the OWF construction could lead to an increase in benthos species and fish benthos feeders whatever the perturbation scenario, while the predicted response of top predators was ambiguous across all perturbation scenario.

In order to maintain a safe operation, it is necessary to evaluate the performance of the structure in extreme conditions such as storm. Previously, various approaches were introduced to analyse the response of an offshore structure in different sea states. However, the proposed methods are computationally time consuming requiring a large number of simulations and it is not the most realistic approach to analyse the dynamic behavior of a structure by separately replicating each level of storm. In this study, a novel numerical model of storm is developed based on Endurance Wave Analysis (EWA) concept. The developed model will reduce the computational cost to only one storm record of 1100 s taking into account the randomness of sea environment. The application of this method is demonstrated by assessing a Floating Storage Unit (FSU) responses encountering a storm in the North Sea.

In both places, recovery caused increased rates of human-crocodile conflict (HCC). Within northern Australia, the crocodile recovery and HCC have been documented over time. In contrast, this has not been the situation in Timor-Leste, where we investigated HCC based on 130 attack records (1996-2014; 52% fatal). In 1996-2006, 0.55 attacks/year were reported in Timor-Leste. By 2007-2014, 9 years later, a 23-fold increase had occurred (13 attacks/year). Traditional subsistence fishing (82.5% of all attack records) is the highest risk activity, followed by bathing (7.5%) and water collecting (4.2%). Although the human population was correlated with crocodile attacks in Timor-Leste, it likely does not explain the dramatic increase in crocodile attacks. Alternatively, crocodile numbers may have increased, either in the remnant resident crocodile population, or via migrants from elsewhere. Permanent crocodile habitat is limited, and limited breeding does not explain the high number of large crocodiles, and consequent increase in attacks in such a short time. A plausible explanation, consistent with traditional knowledge in Timor-Leste, is that the influx of large crocodiles attacking people are migrants from Australia. We examined this possibility from available sources. Within Australia crocodiles have recovered since protection and they regularly invade adjacent habitats, such as Darwin harbor, where they are removed to prevent attacks on people. Saltwater crocodiles have been sighted at oil rigs, in the open ocean, moving between northern Australia and the south coast of Timor-Leste. The likelihood of crocodiles migrating from Australia to Timor-Leste raises obvious conservation, moral, and ethical dilemmas when conserving a large dangerous predator in one country to increase abundance results in dispersal to another country, where the predator attacks and kills people. (c) 2018 The Wildlife Society.We recorded 130 crocodile attacks between 1996 and 2014 in the Southeast Asian nation of Timor-Leste, located approximately 450km north of Australia. Our results indicated that an increase in the numbers of large saltwater crocodiles is the primary factor driving the accelerating human-crocodile conflict in the country and that dispersing crocodiles from Australia may add to the rapid recovery of the Timorese saltwater crocodile population after protection (2000-2005).",,,,,,,,,14,0,0,0,13,0,15,,,0022-541X,1937-2817,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Freiburg, Fac Environm & Nat Resources, Chair Remote Sensing & Landscape Informat Syst, Tennenbacherstr 4, D-79106 Freiburg, GermanyWildlife Management Int, POB 530, Karama, NT 0813, AustraliaCharles Darwin Univ, Res Inst Environm & Livelihoods, Darwin, NT 0909, AustraliaMinist Dev Housing Planning & Environm, Biodivers Directorate, Fomento Bldg,Rua Dom Aleixo Corte Real, Mandarin, Dili, Timor-LesteNatl Univ Timor Leste, Ctr Climate Change & Biodivers, Ave Cidade Lisboa, Dili, Timor-LesteUnited Nations Subreg Off Cent Asia FAO SEC, Food & Agr Org, Ivedik Cad 55, TR-06170 Ankara, Turkey",Wildlife Management IntMinist Dev Housing Planning & EnvironmNatl Univ Timor Leste,,,2018-12-28,WOS:000442501700002,,

Although different resort stuctures have been developed, in 1993 there were 17 hotels consisting of bungalows built on piles along the fringing reef, and this kind of construction is becoming increasingly popular. Our study was designed to estimate the impact of such buildings on the local fish communities. Visual surveys were conducted by two observers at four resorts, under three bungalows built on piles and three adjacent control sites. Overall fish diversity and abundance was higher under the bungalows, with average increases of 10 % and 100 % respectively. A multifactorial ANOVA showed that observers produced consistent counts, so that the data could be reanalysed by a simpler two-factor model (bungalows, localities). Both terms were statistically significant and an interaction was detected. This occurred because one locality differs from the others. With the exclusion of this resort, which was the most modified site, the comparisons showed that bungalows have a strong positive influence on the local fish fauna. We attribute this result to the provision of food and shelter by these artificial structures which are generally located in otherwise simple habitats.

Colonisation was rather rapid and stabilization was achieved in 18 months. The composition, abundance and time of settlement on the artificial reef units mainly depended on the type of the unit, surface and state of conservation of the seabed. The fish community was studied by visual censuses and experimental catches, and in some instances by comparing the reef area with others of similar characteristics, but without reef. The species present, -abundance, size and relationship to the reef units and with the seabed- was taken into account. It also established soon and after two year deployment it remains rather stable in time. The species present were mainly those common to the area, although the relative abundance bore a relation to the type of seabed. Three types of species were observed, depending on their relationship to the units: residents, visitors and transitory species. No recruitment of juveniles was observed, probably due to the depth the boulders are deployed, suggesting that the increase of fish biomass is probably only due to aggregation. In relation to the results in the artisanal fleet, a slightly higher yield of common commercial species per fishing effort unit in the reef area was observed. The results suggest that artificial reefs may be suitable for very degraded or homogenous sea beds, but also point out the need for good knowledge of the area and the importance of a careful fishery management to prevent over-fishing of the whole area by fishing on the artificial reef.",,,,,,,,,2,0,0,0,2,0,2,,,0749-0208,,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Balearic Isl, Dept Biol, Palma De Mallorca 07071, Spain",,,,2006-12-01,WOS:000202961500129,,

The approach is intended to assist engineers in assessing the overall fitness and survivability of aged offshore structures.A 43 m tall radio tower on an oil and gas platform located offshore Australia was reported with areas of heavy and medium corrosion of structural members. Severe corrosion in one leg of the radio tower had caused an obvious hole (extensive damage) through the leg at approximately 36m above the main deck and raised structural integrity concerns with the tower. The platform had been shut down due to concerns of a possible collapse of the tower.An assessment/repair program was developed to assure the short term integrity of the tower with minimal repair works. The integrity of the critically damaged leg had been temporarily restored using a clamped sleeve repair to allow progress with the inspection / thickness measurement of the corroded areas of the tower. As part of the fitness-for-service assessment, the minimum thickness acceptance criteria for the suspected corroded structural members were developed to enable initial assessment of the measured remaining wall thicknesses of the corroded member. Fitness for service integrity assessment requirements were developed to assess the locations that did not meet the minimum thickness criteria. The integrity requirements were adopted based on the average measured wall thickness, sensitivity structural analyses for reduced wind speeds for shorter life spans, and stability/survival assessment of the tower.An inspection program was carried out for the suspected locations and any additional locations identified during the inspection process. The inspection measurements were assessed against the fitness-for-service criteria. Where the measurements indicated that members did not meet the acceptance criteria temporary repairs were specified. Consequently, the tower fitness-for-service was found sustainable for up to 12 months until a more permanent repair or replacement of the tower could be completed, thus enabling the platform to resume normal operations.",,,,,"30th International Conference on Ocean, Offshore and Arctic Engineering30th International Conference on Ocean, Offshore and Arctic Engineering","JUN 19-24, 2011JUN 19-24, 2011","ASME, Ocean Offshore & Arctic Engn DivASME, Ocean Offshore & Arctic Engn Div","Rotterdam, NETHERLANDSRotterdam, NETHERLANDS",3,0,0,0,0,0,3,,,,,978-0-7918-4434-2,,,,,,,,,"WorleyParsons, Principal Struct Engn, Melbourne, Vic, AustraliaWorleyParsons, Struct Engn Discipline, Melbourne, Vic, Australia",WorleyParsonsWorleyParsons,,,2011-01-01,WOS:000314666500104,,

Compared with Airy wave theory, in certain shallow water conditions, the shallow water wave theory can more effectively reflect wave nonlinearity effect in wave load prediction.",,,,,3rd International Conference on Civil Engineering and Transportation (ICCET 2013)3rd International Conference on Civil Engineering and Transportation (ICCET 2013),"DEC 14-15, 2013DEC 14-15, 2013",Guizhou UnivGuizhou Univ,"Kunming, PEOPLES R CHINAKunming, PEOPLES R CHINA",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,1660-9336,,978-3-03835-005-7,,,,,,,,,"Sun Yat Sen Univ, Dept Appl Mech & Engn, Guangzhou 510275, Guangdong, Peoples R China",,,,2014-08-15,WOS:000339031501130,,

For a livestock farmer who is considering establishing environmental plantings of trees for carbon sequestration, the question is 'what are the benefits and costs of growing trees instead of using that land to grow pasture to feed livestock?' In this research, the case study approach and the methods of farm management economics were applied to assess whether growing trees for carbon on part of a prime lamb case study farm in south-west Victoria could be a better use of resources than using that land to graze livestock. The question was investigated for a range of economic and environmental conditions over 25 and 100 years. A condition was that the trees provided no other benefit on farm and the required rate of return on marginal capital was 6% real (10% nominal). The results indicated that the price of carbon would need to be $AUD132/t CO(2)e for growing trees solely for carbon sequestration to be a good investment. Alternatively, if the trees provided benefits in addition to carbon credits, such as shelter for vulnerable young lambs, the investment could be worthwhile to the business at a lower carbon price. Previous research has shown that shelter (in the form of trees, grasshedge rows and other man-made structures) can reduce lamb mortality by reducing wind chill at lambing, through reduced wind speed. The benefits to a farm system from growing trees for carbon depends on the reduction in wind speed the trees create, the weather conditions, the price of lambs, the establishment cost of the trees, the price of carbon, and transaction costs. The results of this research has shown that for the representative livestock farmer, growing trees for carbon is unlikely to be as profitable as alternative uses of their resources.

It will play an increasingly significant role in future years, as part of an energy mix that is moving towards cleaner and more renewable sources. Offshore Wind Turbines (OWTs) have significant environmental challenges in terms of both the marine environment and the weather. This project, led by Perceptual Robotics and in partnership with ASV, the University of Bristol and VulcanUAV - will be developing and testing key technologies to address the autonomous inspection of offshore turbines.Building on an existing capability for the inspection of onshore wind turbines, the team will be working on integrating this with an autonomous surface boat provided by ASV, creating a system which will automatically deploy and recover the inspection drone without the need for human interaction. The long term vision of this project is to enable fully autonomous inspection for OWT - working from an autonomous boat whilst being monitored remotely from land. Key challenges associated with this project include mechanical deployment, robust operations, multi vehicle cooperation, communications and the handling and processing of large datasets.The team consists of specialists in drone design, construction and operation with Perceptual Robotics and VulcanUAV; specialists in autonomous marine vehicles through ASV; experts in computer vision with Bristol University and the ideal facilities in which to develop and test the system at the ORE Catapult facilities. Working together to solve the problems associated with operating an autonomous system in the extreme environment found offshore, the team will need to use modern control theory, sensors, materials, computer technology and AI algorithms to create a platform which can carry out rapid, robust inspections in the marine environment.A fully autonomous system for offshore turbine inspection will not only significantly reduce the costs associated with ongoing inspection, but will also improve the quality and quantity of the inspection data. Modern sensing, including the vision processing offered by the University of Bristol will allow Perceptual Robotics to fly closer and more accurately with respect to the blades, thereby improving the images and maximising the flight envelope. This in turn will offer the potential for accurate condition monitoring and possible lifetime extensions. The UK is currently a world leader in offshore wind energy and this project will provide a further step change in the efficiency and quality of inspections.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,104067,,,,,,,,Perceptual Robotics Limited,Perceptual Robotics Limited,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:15345412,,

Next, artificial reefs were relocated, together with all their fish inhabitants, closer to the natural reef. Following relocation, resident fishes of the artificial reefs exhibited a sharp decline in numbers, while predatory fish density increased. Both video observations of the relocated artificial reefs and the correlation between piscivore aggregation and decline of the resident fishes revealed that the cause of decline was the strong predation around the artificial reefs. The decline was density-dependent, such that the per-capita rate of decline was higher on artificial reefs with higher fish density.

Strong winds and high sea levels generate more large waves and drive them much closer to the UK's shore than before. The coastline, offshore platforms, renewable energy converters and marine vessels are battered by storms, and their integrity is placed under the threat of violent wave impact. Such extreme events also challenge the emergency landing of aircraft in the sea particularly ditching helicopters as well as the launch and recovery operations of lifeboats from larger vessels under high sea states. To mitigate the uncertainties and risks posed by such natural hazards on the public safety and the economic activity of the UK, it is vital for research, industry and governmental bodies to improve the design of coastal and offshore structures through the accurate prediction of the extreme wave loadings and the resultant damage by the development and use of high-fidelity new generation free surface modelling tools, which combine mathematical and physical science as well as the latest software engineering technology.The overall aim of this project is to develop such a powerful numerical tool to enable academics and industrial users to gain new scientific insights and better understanding of the air entrainment process in wave breaking. This will help determine the critical aeration level and distribution before/within/after wave breaking, and predict the characteristics of the resultant impact loadings on coastal and offshore structures through CFD simulation. This will be accomplished by re-engineering and extending the capabilities of an existing novel compressible multiphase hydro-code incorporating an advanced two-fluid hybrid turbulence modelling approach, fluid surface tension and adaptive high order numerical discretisation schemes deployed by state-of-the-art HPC facilities.The availability and use of the tools and data produced by the project will firmly support academics and engineers to modify/improve the designs of crucial defence systems in order to address increasing environmental challenges, protect valuable personal and public assets, safeguard local residents and commuters, and ensure the integrity of transport lines.

The data for this study was obtained from interviews with 290 artisanal fishers from three districts of Terengganu, using a structured questionnaire. The study found that for fishers, income from fishing was significantly lower in AR areas, compared to non-AR areas. The income of the fishers who used drift nets as their main fishing gear was significantly lower in AR areas. This indicates that income from fishing was not attributable to the AR programme in Malaysia. The results suggest that artificial reefs may not be effective at increasing catch and income for artisanal fishers in Terengganu. Furthermore, the larger-engined boats gained substantial fishing income, which seems to reflect unequal distribution of benefits, because only those who could invest in fishing equipment and who spent more on fishing operations were able to gain maximum benefits. The results suggest that the current use of multiple gear in the same fishing locations created conflicts between various groups of fishers, and increased fishing costs. These conflicts could be reduced if the artificial reef locations are clearly marked and they established user rights among various fisher groups. The fisheries agencies involved in artificial reefs programme should ensure that artificial reef development produces positive social and economic benefits for the local fishing communities through sustainable fisheries management in Malaysia.

Regarding the colonization dynamics, a dramatic snow-ball effect was documented over time, with local density reaching up to 50 individuals per m after 2 years. Assignment tests showed that the primary colonizers came from neighboring populations established in natural rocky reefs. A shift towards a self-sustaining population was however observed the following year, with 44% of self-assignment. These processes are best explained by (i) life history traits, notably rapid growth and selfing, and (ii) natural dispersal within the marina combined with human-mediated dispersal-through leisure boating- over longer distances. Spill-over effects have been previously documented, and here also reported, to explain the expansion of U. pinnatifida from marinas to the wild. We showed that the on-going ocean sprawl also offers a perfect arena for spill-back events (i.e., spread from natural habitats to artificial structures), highlighting the need for careful surveillance of newly built infrastructures.",,,,,,,,,7,0,0,0,7,0,7,,,1387-3547,1573-1464,,,,,,,,,,"SU, CNRS, Lab Adaptat & Div Marine Environm, UMR 7144,Stn Biol Roscoff, Pl G Teissier, F-29680 Roscoff, FranceUniv Quebec Montreal UQAM, Dept Sci Biol, POB 8888,Succursale Ctr Ville, Montreal, PQ H3C 3P8, CanadaSU, CNRS, Federat Rech FR 2424, Stn Biol Roscoff, Pl G Teissier, F-29680 Roscoff, France",,,,2020-04-02,WOS:000519618900015,,

In this study, we describe a monitoring and analysis framework that uses aerial photography, remotely sensed imagery, and field surveys to detect changes in beach width and area along Gonghyunjin and Songjiho Beaches in South Korea. We used IKONOS imagery acquired in 2004; aerial photographs captured in 1991, 2005, 2009 and 2010; and field surveys conducted in 2010 and 2011. Based on comparisons of these data sources, we detected widespread erosion on both beaches starting in 2004, resulting in 12% reduction in the plane area of these beaches between 2004 and 2010. Most dramatically, we noted that beach width eroded by 28.5 m at the point 700 m south of Gonghyunjin Harbor, and similar declines occurred at several other locations. Erosion occurred at these locations because extended breakwaters in the Gonghyunjin Harbor either blocked or interrupted drift sand transport processes, causing sand to be carried away from some locations without accretion to replenish it. In addition, according to field surveys, we determined that erosion and accretion processes continued to vary seasonally in 2010 and 2011, resulting in smaller overall changes than those in the study years prior to 2010. However, we suggest that severe erosion may occur in the future at some locations if sand continues to be transported north onto Songjiho Beach without replenishment. Thus, we demonstrated that the construction of artificial structures around the harbor caused changes along the shoreline.

IPEC have pioneered PD monitoring technology as a tool for use in assetmanagement over the last 8 years, largely in collaboration with EDF Energy on their Londonand South East based distribution network. As the technology has developed and marketsevolved it has become apparent that the most compelling business case for installation ofpermanent monitoring is on high criticality circuits where a failure would pose safetyconcerns or have a high financial impact. As a result IPEC’s strongest sales have been in theindustrial sector and in particular process plants for instance, chemical plants, steel plants andsemi-conductor fabs. In order to do this we have developed very sophisticated data acquisitionand analysis algorithms that can detect the small PD signals in very high background noise.Much of IPEC’s business has been overseas into regions investing in manufacturing soalthough gross margins on the technology are high so are the costs of sale. A typicalinstallation for a single substation may cost in the region of £25-35K.With the high and rapidly increasing investment in off-shore wind farms around the UK, IPEChave identified an opportunity to bring the benefits PD monitoring to offshore assetmanagement. The working environment of the high voltage network connecting wind turbinesis harsh, increasing the likelihood of defects and failure. In addition the cost of repairing afailed component and the consequential damages are very high.By permanently monitoring the network of subsea cables and switchgear that interconnect theturbines, the asset operators will be able to identify and very accurately locate defects before afailure occurs. In many cases this will allow preventative maintenance to be carried out thusavoiding failure altogether.Off-shore wind farms generally have a 20 year design lifetime and it is estimated that the costof this monitoring technology would be offset by avoiding just two failures over this period.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,710007,,,,,,,,Ipec Limited,Ipec Limited,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:15298548,,

The primary aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that removing limpets from the midlittoral of artificial breakwaters in the northwest Mediterranean led to changes in assemblages similar to those observed on rocky shores in the same area. Orthogonal combinations of the presence/absence of two species of limpets, P. aspera and P rustica, were produced using manual removals from June 1997 to February 1998. To test the hypothesis that the effects of limpets were variable at spatial scales comparable to those investigated on rocky shores, we repeated the experiment at two locations tens of kilometres apart, and on two reefs within each location a few kilometres apart. The results revealed strong and relatively consistent negative effects of limpets on filamentous algae, whereas interactions with other members of assemblages were complex and variable. Several taxa (Cyanophyta, encrusting and articulated coralline algae, Ralfsia and Rissoella) were abundant at one location but nearly absent at the other. This large-scale variability in patterns of distribution generated inconsistencies in the effects of limpets between locations. Within locations, several effects of P. aspera and P. rustica were observed, ranging from independent effects on some organisms, to additive or interactive effects on others. Apparently, the removal of filamentous algae by limpets resulted in positive indirect effects on Ralfsia and Rissoella. Collectively, these effects were comparable to those described for rocky shores in the northwest Mediterranean. The processes accounting for large-scale variation in grazing, however, appeared different between the natural and the artificial habitat. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

The introduction of exotic species to new areas poses a major threat to the environment. For those introduced species that establish and survive beyond the short term, the opportunities to manage the risk of continuing spread often rest with limiting reproductive output. The introduced northern Pacific seastar Asterias amurensis is an ecologically important pest that has established in the Derwent Estuary (Australia). Driven by oversupply of bivalve prey, it is persistent, abundant and fecund when associated with man-made structures such as docks, marinas, jetties and piers, that is, wharves. 2. As a free-spawning invertebrate, fertilization by A. amurensis is a critical life-history stage constrained by strong Allee effects. Eggs must be released in close proximity to sperm sources because the chances of achieving fertilization drastically reduce with increasing distances of spawner separation. 3. Investigation of zygote production in the Derwent Estuary using a spatially explicit model of free-spawning fertilization shows that A. amurensis at wharves, while representing <10% of the total population in the estuary and concentrated in <0.1% of the total area, may contribute >90% of total zygote production. Given the seastars long-lived and highly dispersive larvae, we show that wharves not only represent important sites of invasion but also facilitate propagule pressure promoting secondary invasions. 4. Synthesis and applications. In the absence of effective pest control solutions, focusing on reproductive hotspots has the potential to reduce further spread of established marine pests and to alleviate ongoing ecological impacts. In the case of the northern Pacific seastar, elimination of highly localized wharf populations annually prior to spawning can reduce overall zygote production by up to estimated 90%. The long-term protection of key sources of larval production is a common goal for marine reserve design and fisheries management. However, the same concept but in reverse, whereby larval production is minimized at key sources, could be effective in the management of introduced pests in subtidal marine environments.",,,,,,,,,17,0,0,0,17,0,18,,,0021-8901,1365-2664,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Tasmania, Inst Marine & Antarctic Studies, Hobart, Tas 7005, AustraliaUniv Tasmania, Inst Marine & Antarctic Studies, Taroona, Tas 7053, AustraliaDept Primary Ind Pk Water & Environm, Hobart, Tas 7001, Australia",Dept Primary Ind Pk Water & Environm,,,2012-06-21,WOS:000304660500024,,

There are few records of this disease in the northwestern Gulf of Mexico, a region characterized by soft muddy bottoms that are considered poor habitat for the CTX source dinoflagellate Gambierdiscus toxicus. However, the approximately 4000 petroleum production platforms and hundreds of state-sponsored artificial reefs located in the Gulf of Mexico provide hard substrate and often support coral and other components of the tropical benthos. In addition to their role in their resource extraction, these oil production platforms are also popular sites for recreational fishing and sport diving. We examined these platforms as potential substrate for G. toxicus and report a first record of this species in the NW Gulf of Mexico. All the platforms (n = 6) examined harbored the dinoflagellate as an epiphyte on the fouling community, with three finds of G. toxicus associated with the pelagic macroalga, Sargassum. Only minor toxicity (< 0.15 ppb) was noted in two of 20 great barracuda (Sphyraena barracuda) examined. Tagging data suggest trans-Gulf migrations by barracuda are common; thus, we cannot determine if the toxicity was acquired locally or transported in migrating fish.These platforms are a clear example of how human activity has altered the environment in a way that allows expansion of a HA-B population. The rapid increase in production platforms since 1942 has provided novel substrate in a sandy/muddy bottom environment generally considered to be poor habitat for these benthic dinoflagellates. These platforms create a unique habitat in the upper euphotic zone and serve as intersection points for fishermen and potentially toxic fish. Many Gulf of Mexico states have active programs to turn non-producing platforms into artificial reefs. Our results suggest that the use of these platforms as fisheries enhancement structures could have unintended consequences for human health, particularly if projected rising sea-surface temperatures over the next century alter benthic distributions and fish migration patterns. These concerns also extend to mariculture operations around oil production rigs or offshore wind farms, both of which would also add substrate for epibenthic microalgae. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

This technique has many desirable features for construction, operation and maintenance of large floating facilities in the coastal ocean environment. Since the structural material is mainly frozen coastal waters affixed to a metal or plastic framework there is relatively little environmental impact in its construction and operation in coastal waters. This method provides a means of sustainable development in harmony with the environment. A big advantage of using ambient waters is its easy access and inexhaustible supply and that the specific gravity of a frozen structure is lower than the surrounding water and thus provides buoyancy for the structure. The proposed technique makes pre-shaped artificial structures.Frozen modular structures can be configured in many shapes and sizes suitable for developing various near-shore and offshore facilities. The more cost effective application would be for large facilities such as floating airports, floating bases, fish farms, floating industrial islands, floating ports and docking facilities floating cities, and combinations of these.Building large floating structures requires enormous amounts of cooling energy. Liquid natural gas (LNG) is used at -162 degrees centigrade as the source of thermal energy. Since LNG is used for gas energy it is abundantly available as an energy source near large coastal communities. The coastal water used will primarily be drawn from fresh water river outflows or brackish water from nearby estuaries. Once frozen, there are several proven methods that can be used to insulate the structure to limit thawing.The structure size and shape is determined by the preconstructed framework. Plastic membrane structures can be used for the frameworks. The resulting ice structures are very durable in compression and impact loads. The cost of material and material transportation is relatively economical.Another application for this in situ freezing technique can be for salvage of sunken ships or other manmade objects by displacing water with ice to restore buoyancy. Another application is for an outer space structure using liquefied oxygen and hydrogen fuels. Some of this fuel can be converted to water in space and the ambient temperature of space can freeze the water into desired shapes and sizes for use in space construction.",,,,,IEEE OCEANS Conference and Exhibition on Engineering for Sustainable Use of the Oceans (OCEANS 98)IEEE OCEANS Conference and Exhibition on Engineering for Sustainable Use of the Oceans (OCEANS 98),"SEP 28-OCT 01, 1998SEP 28-OCT 01, 1998",IEEE; IEEE Ocean Engn SocIEEE; IEEE Ocean Engn Soc,"NICE, FRANCENICE, FRANCE",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,0-7803-5045-6,,,,,,,,,"Global Ocean Inc, Potomac, MD 20854 USA",Global Ocean Inc,,,1998-01-01,WOS:000078340800199,,

The idea of using an artificial reef as a model of a natural reef in statu nascendi has led to fundamental knowledge of the development of a coral reef. Over more than 20 years, it has been possible to observe the successive structural and ecological processes involved for the first time. In view of the scope and duration of the study, the use of this artificial reef clearly stands out from other so-called artificial reefs. Other purposes than basic reef research for which artificial reefs are used include an increase in fishery yields, the protection and development of macrophyte stands, coastal protection, attractions for diving tourism, and reef rehabilitation by prostheses. The use of the term artificial reef for structures incompatible with current definitions of coral reef is rejected. One insight in initial reef development gained from the reef models is that settlement and growth of corals on the one hand and the activity of grazers on the other hand result in the formation of a disjunct pattern of diversity with nuclei of high structural complexity and species number. They become protoreef communities, the empty areas between then slowly are encroached by those coral patches. This principle of nucleation is translated into practical measures in a new approach to rehabilitate and restore degraded coral reefs. Artificial mini-reefs are formed by electrochemical precipitation of calcium-carbonate from the seawater onto an aptly formed wire matrix and by transplantation of coral nubbins thereon. The community of coral tranplants and newly settled recruits may function as stepping stones to repopulate mechanically devastated reef areas.

J,,,,,,,,,,,Improving Understanding and Parameterisation of the Marine Atmospheric Boundary Layer (MABL) in Near Coastal Regions,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Awarded Grant,Jan 01 2016,2016,"The UK leads the world in terms of the installation of offshore wind farms. However, our understanding of the wind conditions offshore is limited compared with onshore, mainly due to the lack of offshore measurements. The performance and longevity of offshore wind turbines very much depends on the wind conditions in which the machines operate. This research aims to provide a better understanding of the marine atmospheric boundary layer (MABL) in near coastal regions where offshore wind farms are frequently constructed. Present understanding of the atmospheric boundary layer (ABL) comes primarily from land based observations in flat homogeneous terrain. These observations have led to the development of similarity relationships such as that by Monin and Obukhov (MO). It is becoming apparent that MO similarity scaling may not be appropriate for offshore applications, particularly in non-homogeneous situations with land/sea flows and periods of significant thermal stratification. Key to a better understanding of the MABL are detailed meteorological measurements. Such measurements are scarce, though a number of offshore masts and fixed/floating LiDAR devices have started to be deployed by the offshore wind power industry. Data from such installations are generally commercially sensitive and difficult to access. The Offshore Renewable Energy Catapult recently installed the Narec Offshore Anemometry Hub (NOAH) meteorological mast 6km from the coast near Blyth, Northumberland. This provides meteorological measurements at multiple heights up to 104m above the sea surface. This mast provides wind resource and environmental data for research and commercial testing. In addition, a coastal LiDAR provides profiles up to 170m, appropriate for studying the land/sea transition. The research student will use the data to study the local MABL. This will be supplemented by additional remote sensing data, e.g. satellite as well as operational forecast and reanalysis datasets.The student will combine statistical data analysis with numerical modelling approaches which will include mesoscale and computational fluid dynamics (CFD) codes to provide a better understanding of the MABL and to develop new scaling relationships more appropriate for the near coastal region (<100km). This project has the potential to make a real impact in terms of a better understanding of the operating environment for offshore wind farms.The student will work within the Centre for Renewable Energy Systems Technology (CREST).

To address this knowledge gap, we investigated whether temporal and spectral characteristics of biological sound production differ between natural and artificial offshore reefs. Specifically, we analyzed recordings from 5 week-long hydrophone deployments on 2 natural rocky reefs and 2 artificial reefs on the North Carolina, USA, continental shelf. Analysis of sound pressure levels (SPLs) on hourly and seasonal scales revealed similar temporal patterns between the reef types. These patterns were largely driven by 4 dominant fish vocalizers with seasonal chorusing patterns, including a toadfish Opsanus sp. Despite similar temporal patterns within reef types, soundscape spectral content was more similar within than between reef types, especially during the April deployment, which had the most acoustic activity. Our findings suggest that the soundscapes of shipwreck artificial reefs may differ from the soundscapes of natural rocky reefs, possibly due to differing community composition. As sound plays an important role in the navigation and settlement of many marine species, soundscape differences between natural and artificial habitats could affect ecosystem function through species behavior and interactions.",,,,,,,,,4,0,0,0,4,0,5,,,0171-8630,1616-1599,,,,,,,,,,"Univ N Carolina, Dept Biol, 120 South Rd, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USACSS Inc, 10301 Democracy Lane,Suite 300, Fairfax, VA 22030 USANOAA, Natl Ocean Serv, Natl Ctr Coastal Ocean Sci, 101 Pivers Isl Rd, Beaufort, NC 28516 USANorth Carolina State Univ, Dept Marine Earth & Atmospher Sci, 2800 Faucette Dr, Raleigh, NC 27607 USANorth Carolina State Univ, Ctr Geospatial Analyt, 2800 Faucette Dr, Raleigh, NC 27607 USAUniv N Carolina, Inst Marine Sci, 3431 Arendell St, Morehead City, NC 28557 USADuke Univ, Marine Lab, Nicholas Sch Environm, 135 Duke Marine Lab Rd, Beaufort, NC 28516 USADuke Univ, Marine Lab, Pratt Sch Engn, 135 Duke Marine Lab Rd, Beaufort, NC 28516 USA",,,,2021-03-02,WOS:000621226100003,,

During the acceding process the Croatian government strongly committed to an intensive development in the renewable energy sector. In particular, each EU member state is supposed to reach the mandatory 20% share of renewable sources in the total energy consumption by the year 2020, which goal now applies to Croatia as well. At this point, a significant Croatian renewable energy source is hydro power. However, it is at its peak and does not have a potential for further development due to limited natural hydro resources. On the other hand, onshore wind farms developed strongly in the past decade, with their limit in the sight though, as the most licenses for potential wind farm locations are already awarded by the Croatian government. At this point there is not a single offshore renewable energy power plant available in the Croatian part of the Adriatic Sea indicating an interesting possibility in that direction. Hence, in this study, we analyze a potential for development of an offshore renewable energy power plant in the Croatian part of the Adriatic Sea with likely implication on the environment and economy. We particularly focus on technology that would exploit the kinetic energy of wind and sea currents, whereas structural design issues, wind and tidal potential, sea depths, and sea traffic routes were thoroughly analyzed in order to identify the potential locations for the proposed renewable energy concepts. Electrical energy output is calculated and potential technical issues identified in order to highlight expected environmental and social benefits of such a challenging task as it is designing, manufacturing and maintaining of an offshore power plant in the Croatian part of the Adriatic Sea.

A tradeoff made in many product systems is the exchange of potential for occupational accidents with the additional use of energy and materials. Net benefits of safety measures with respect to human health are best illustrated if the consequences avoided and health impacts induced by additional emissions are assessed using commensurable metrics. Our aim is to develop a human health impact indicator for offshore crane lifts. Crane lifts are a major cause of accidents on offshore oil and gas (O & G) rigs, and health impacts from crane lift accidents should be included in comparative LCA of O & G technologies if the alternatives differ in the use of crane lifts.Materials and methods Accident records for mobile offshore petroleum installations were used to develop an empirical occupational health indicator for crane lifts in LCA. Probabilistic parameters were introduced in the procedure, and results were calculated by Monte Carlo simulation. The disability adjusted life years (DALY) framework was used to classify health outcome. The characterization factor for offshore crane lifts was applied in three comparisons to evaluate the significance of crane lifts to human health impacts from drilling technology.Results The mean occupational health impact per crane lift was 4.5.10(6) DALY, with cumulative percentiles {P (2.5), P (50), P (97.5)}={6.0.10(-7), 3.1.10(-6), 1.7.10(-5)}. Analogously, the fatal accident frequency was described by {P (2.5), P (50), P (97.5)}={7.6.10(-9), 3.9.10(-8), 2.0.10(-7)}, with mean 5.6.10(-8) lives lost per crane lift.Discussion The uncertainty in the results is caused mainly by the random nature of accidents, i.e., variability in accident frequency. Applications of the characterization factor indicate that although crane lifts may not be significant to the overall health impact of the life cycle of drilling fluids, they are important to the occupational safety of employees on offshore drilling rigs and contribute significantly to the life cycle health impact of loading technologies used to transport drilling waste to shore. A comparative LCA of technologies for loading and off-loading drilling wastes shows that a recently developed hydraulic system performs better than the traditional crane lift alternative in terms of human health impacts.Conclusions With the availability of statistics to assess the risk of single mechanical operations, safety aspects may well be included in LCA. For the case of offshore crane lifts, the uncertainty in the characterization factor compares favorably to what is indicated for other human health impact chains. In further work of quantifying occupational health impacts in DALY using accident statistics, it is advised to see if records of non-recoverable injuries (fatalities and amputation cases) can be used to simplify the damage assessment procedure as recoverable injuries were insignificant to the total burden from crane accidents.Recommendations and perspectives The characterization factor for crane lifts identifies contributions to life cycle health impact from loading technologies that otherwise would have been overlooked in LCA. While many contest the inclusion of occupational accidents in LCA, our results show that such impacts can be included and that their consideration adds valuable insights.",,,,,,,,,7,0,0,0,4,0,9,,,0948-3349,1614-7502,,,,,,,,,,"Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol, Ind Ecol Programme, NTNU, N-7491 Trondheim, NorwayNorwegian Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Energy & Proc Engn, NTNU, N-7491 Trondheim, Norway",,,,2008-08-01,WOS:000257960600010,,

Data were collected from boat-owning fishermen by a random telephone survey. Within target species groups, catch rates were compared among five fishing sites inside Chesapeake Bay and two offshore reefs. Fishermen's target species options were more diverse at estuarine (bay) sites, primarily the result of Sciaenidae species (Leiostomus xanthurus, Micropogonias undulatus, and Cynoscion regalis) and Paralichthys dentatus. The Gwynn's Island Test Reef, closest to mid-bay, provided significantly higher mean catch rates of L. xanthurus in 1988 than lower bay sites. Mean catch rates of Tautoga onitis at the ''mid-bay'' site were equivalent in both study years to those at most lower bay sites as well as two offshore reefs. Mean catch rates of Centropristis striata were generally higher at offshore sites compared to bay sites. Regarding indices of fishing experience quality, lower bay sites ranked relatively close for trips targeting a mixed Sciaenidae-P. dentatus species group. Based upon fishing trips targeting C. striata-T. onitis, the mid-bay reef and one lower bay structure site ranked above offshore reefs. Mean catch rates of ''desirable'' species at the mid-bay reef compared favorably in 1987 with results of a fishery-independent monitoring study of the same site.

However, conventional tower-mounted wind turbines have three main problems that limit their potential: (1) only about 12 percent of communities have strong enough ground winds to make projects economical; (2) installations are too expensive, requiring a crane and concrete foundation; (3) many communities oppose wind, citing noise or avian impact. This project will develop a breakthrough Airborne Wind Turbine (AWT) to expand the potential low cost wind energy in rural communities. The AWT uses a helium-filled inflatable shell to lift a lightweight turbine 50 to 200 stories high, where winds are up to five times stronger than those reached by a tower. A conductive tether holds the AWT steady and sends power to the ground. The lifting technology is adapted from aerostats: tethered blimps that have been used for decades to reliably lift telecom and surveillance equipment into the air for months at a time. The AWT can expand low cost wind power to hundreds or thousands of new rural communities by tapping stronger high altitude winds, reducing installation time, and lowering community impact. The key research objective of this project is to develop and test a fully-functional AWT prototype that demonstrates its potential for commercial deployment. There are three main technical objectives: (i) design and fabricate a rotor and drive train that integrate composite materials and compact design to significantly lower weight relative to leading tower-mounted turbines, (ii) demonstrate extended, autonomous operations of the AWT prototype in real-world environmental conditions, and (iii) demonstrate a communications and controls systems that allows for remote monitoring and control of the AWT prototype. Following on the Phase I feasibility analysis, Phase II will include a requirements definition, the design and fabrication of a custom lightweight turbine, development of the controls and communications infrastructure for remote operation of the AWT, assembly of a sub-scale inflatable shell, and extended duration autonomous testing in real world conditions. Altaeros anticipates that this technology will demonstrate reliable, high capacity power production beyond the current technology of tower-mounted turbines. The main commercial opportunity is to develop a mid-sized AWT that can expand economical wind power to regions with weak ground-level winds. In addition, the AWT can displace expensive diesel fuel used in off-grid generators used at a variety of sites including remote industrial, island and arctic communities, emergency power, and military bases. In the long term, the AWT will be scaled up to provide a solution to harnesses vast offshore wind resources located over deep water. This research supports USDA goals by enhancing rural prosperity by lowering consumer energy rates, increasing electric system reliability, mitigating climate change, decreasing regional pollution and water shortages, and providing new direct turbine lease payments to rural landowners.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,2012-33610-20169; 578087,,,,,,,,ALTAEROS ENERGIES INC,ALTAEROS ENERGIES INC,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:12422069,,

Recently, some researchers have proposed the use of real options models for the assessment of infrastructure projects for hydrocarbon exploitation from an economics point of view. The objective of this work is to develop real options models for decision making regarding inspection, maintenance and decommissioning of offshore facilities taking into account the financial and technical aspects of the project. In all cases it is considered that at some point in the future, within the service lifetime of the structure, the decision maker will have an option to carry or not an inspection, and take or not a maintenance or decommissioning action, which will determine the structural and financial performance of the project for its remaining lifetime. The in-service times with no structural failure and the rehabilitation times are modeled as random variables. The cash flows are modeled as stochastic processes considering interruption of operation due to repairs after failure. Analytical expressions are derived for the computation of structural reliability and availability depending upon maintenance actions. An example is given for a jacket platform subjected to fatigue deterioration and damage. Simple and compound options of maintenance and decommissioning options are analyzed. The value of the project is computed by means of an approach similar to that of Black and Scholes for financial options [2].

Common methods to estimate remolded shear strength, such as correlations with cone penetration data, direct measurement with an in situ field vane shear device, and laboratory measurements, produce varied results and can be particularly costly and time consuming. Full-flow penetrometers (T-bar and Ball) provide an alternative rapid method to estimate remolded shear strength and soil sensitivity through remolding soil by repeated cycling of the penetrometer up and down over a given depth interval. The cyclic penetration resistance degradation curve inherently contains information regarding remolded strength and sensitivity. The objective of this paper is to assess the ability of full-flow penetrometers to predict remolded strength and soil sensitivity, and to develop a suite of predictive correlations in which these properties can be estimated in the absence of complementary laboratory or in situ test data. To accomplish this, full-flow penetration profiles and cyclic tests were performed at five well characterized soft clay sites, which together represent the broad range of soils in which the penetrometers will be often used. A previously developed model for the reduction in penetration resistance with cycling is modified to predict the entire degradation curve, including the remolded penetration resistance using only measurements obtained during initial penetrometer penetration and extraction. Using field vane shear strength as the reference measurement, correlations are developed to predict soil sensitivity and remolded shear strength based solely on full-flow penetrometer data, which is particularly useful in site investigation programs where site specific data are not yet available or are sparse. Finally, the usefulness of these relationships is demonstrated by implementing them for two additional soft clay sites.",,,,,,,,,58,3,0,0,1,0,66,,,1090-0241,1943-5606,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Calif Davis, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Davis, CA 95616 USAGeosyntec Consultants, Acton, MA 01720 USAUniv Massachusetts, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Amherst, MA 01003 USAUniv Western Australia, Ctr Offshore Fdn Syst, Crawley, WA 6009, Australia",Geosyntec Consultants,,,2009-09-01,WOS:000269061400002,,

Abalone grew significantly faster in tubes and cages (mean length increase 61 +/- 10.7 mu m and 54 +/- 5.3 mu m day(-1) respectively) than in barrels (mean length increase 39 +/- 3.31 mu m day(-1)). Abalone grown in tubes and fed a diet of Makara grew significantly faster than abalone grown in tubes and fed a diet produced by Coast Biologicals. Abalone in cages fed a diet produced by Coast Biologicals grew significantly faster than abalone in cages fed Makara. The difference in growth produced by the two diets may be related to improved food availability in cages throughout the feeding period. Mortality was high in all structures (66% of the entire experimental population) and did not differ significantly among structure and diet treatments, Mortalities were thought to be caused by a combination of shell infestations (by burrowing worms) and silty water conditions within the grow-out structures.

There are many factors that could possibly affect the health of these steel structures, particularly hydrodynamic forces. These forces cause the structure to vibrate and in the long run could lead to fatigue failure. Therefore, measures have to be taken in order to prevent these structures from failing. Magneto-rheological (MR) dampers are proven as a feasible alternative to reducing structural vibrations. An experimental setup is built in our laboratory to improve the dynamic modeling of steel jacketlike structures and study the effectiveness of MR dampers in decreasing the hydrodynamically induced vibrations.

In parallel, there is a need to better understand the effects of these installations on coastal marine ecosystems and identify potential sea use conflicts, especially when the area is subject to access restrictions. This study investigated the effects of a spatial closure during the exploitation phase of an offshore wind farm in the extended Bay of Seine (English Channel, France) using Ecospace, a spatially and temporally explicit module of Ecopath with Ecosim. To address this question, simulations were conducted through the evaluation of what-if scenarios to assess the effectiveness of a fishing exclusion zone inside and surrounding the offshore wind farm. Several biomass, catch and trophic level-based indicators were calculated to evaluate how the exclusion zone could affect fishing activities and main components of the food web. All the indicators were estimated in the extended Bay of Seine and summarized by subarea. Findings suggested that the spillover effect could mitigate the negative impact of access loss on fishing activities, in a scenario of simulated closure of the area of the wind farm. The Ecospace model predicted an increase of catches (up to 7% near the wind farm) and a slight increase in the proportion of high trophic level species. However, the influence of spillover effects is limited in space and the expected increase of biomass and catches are highly localized in areas around the offshore wind farm installations. At the scale of the Bay of Seine, further analysis of the spillover effects revealed a spatial pattern and suggested that the implementation of an exclusion zone inside the offshore wind farm could concentrate highly mobile predators.",,,,,,,,,24,1,0,0,15,0,26,,,0924-7963,1879-1573,,,,,,,,,,"IFREMER, Unite Halieut Manche Mer Nord Ifremer, HMMN, F-62200 Boulogne Sur Mer, FranceNormandie Univ, UniCaen, CNRS,MNHN,IRD,SU,UA, EcoFunc,Lab Borea Biol Organismes & Ecosystemos A, CS 14032, F-14000 Caen, FranceMarine & Freshwater Res Ctr MFRC, Galway Mayo Inst Technol GMIT, Dublin Rd, Galway, IrelandIFREMER, Unite Ecol & Modeles & Halieut Ifremer, EMH, F-29280 Ploussane, FranceNormandie Univ UNICAEN, UMR M2C, UCN, UR,CNRS 6143, 24 Rue Tilleuls, F-14000 Caen, FranceUniv Littoral Cote dOpale, Univ Lille, CNRS, UMR 8187,Lab Oceanol & Geosci, F-62930 Wimereux, FranceIFREMER, Unite Halieut Manche Mer Nord Ifremer, HMMN, F-14520 Port En Bessin, FranceUniv Brest, Inst Rech Dev, CNRS, IFREMER,LEMAR, F-29280 Ploussane, FranceFrance Energies Marines ITE EMR, 525 Ave Alexis de Rochon, F-29280 Plouzane, France",Marine & Freshwater Res Ctr MFRCFrance Energies Marines ITE EMR,,,2020-11-11,WOS:000582806700013,,

Besides, it has more low-story buildings than a cityspace and is often viewed from a high place because mountains take a large portion of the Korean peninsula. After 1970s, however, most artificial structures had been built without planning due to the rapid industrialization, and rural villages had been painted to disorderly colors, ignoring the regional characteristics. Even though the landscape planning has been recently introduced, coloring still remains merely as a guideline in a process of planning the overall landscape in a region. Compared to a city where a detailed color planning is impossible due to rapid changes in a city and a variety and complexity of exterior materials, a rural village changes slowly and exterior materials can be viewed as a scenery of a constant pattern. Therefore creating a concrete color plan can effectively lead a rural village into a beautiful place. This study selected three representative sites (sea, mountain, and harbor for each) from Jeju special self-governing province which is the best vacation spot in Korea and contains all characteristics of rural landscapes, and conducted research on the process of establishing color plans harmonious with the natural landscapes of the sites. This study investigated and analyzed examples of harmonious color plans with natural landscapes on similar islands of Jeju and examples in which material colors of historic resources are kept alive. Through this process, those examples draw a conclusion that an unified color of the roofs and the harmony with natural landscapes, especially with the color of seashores are crucial. This study investigated and analyzed coloring by seperating the natural landscape and the artificial landscape for each site, and the result was that using a higher saturation than natural colors and chaotic colors destroys the quality of the landscape. To solve this problem, this study chose colors extracted from the natural elements as the identity of the corresponding site to become the basis of the color palette, and let people to freely choose their own colors of their beautiful houses, considering the characteristics of island village people that they have a strong pride in living in the island, have an active local community, live in single houses, and think individual identities important. This study points out that color planning will last only if color plannings in rural villages importantly consider the harmony with natural landscapes and give freedom of choice to the residents, and if the colors of buildings must harmoniously change in accordance with changes in time and residents.",,,,"농어촌경관은 인공경관과 자연경관의 복합으로 나타나며 자연경관과 건축물이 동시에 인지되는 특징을 가진다. 그러나 70년대 이후 개발 위주의 계획으로 무분별한 건축물이 세워 졌고 원색적인 색이 주를 이루는 도료의 발달로 우리나라의 농촌은 지역의 특성과는 조화롭지 못한 무질서한 색채로 도색되어왔다. 최근 들어 경관계획이 이루어지고는 있으나 지역의 총체적인 경관을 계획하는 과정에서 색채는 가이드라인을 세우는 정도에서 언급되고 있다. 변화가 많고 빠르게 변하며 외장재의 종류도 다양하고 복잡하여 구체적인 색채계획이 불가능한 도시에 비해 농촌은 느리게 변하며 사용외장재도 일정한 패턴을 보이는 풍경으로 인식되므로 구체적인 색채계획을 수립하는 게 아름다운 농촌을 만드는데 더 효과적이다. 본 연구는 우리나라의 최대의 휴양지이며 농촌경관의 특징을 모두 가진 제주특별자치도를 중심으로 대표성 있는 대상지 세 곳(바다, 산, 항구)을 선정하여 자연경관과 조화로운 색채계획을 수립하는 과정을 연구하였다. 사례로는 제주특별자치도와 유사한 섬들을 대상으로 자연경관과 조화로운 색채계획의 사례, 오랜 역사자원의 소재 색이 이어져 온 사례를 조사 분석하였으며 이를 통해 통일감 있는 지붕의 색, 자연경관, 특히 해변의 색과 조화가 필요함을 도출하였다. 각각의 대상지에 대해 자연환경과 인공환경으로 나누어 색채를 조사, 분석하였으며 대부분 자연환경의 색보다 높은 채도와 무질서한 색의 사용이 경관의 질을 훼손하고 있는 것으로 조사되었다. 이를 해결하기 위해 대상지의 정체성을 대표하는 자연요소에서 색을 추출하여 색채 팔레트를 구성하는 근간으로 삼았으며 지정학적 특성상 섬거주에 대한 자부심이 강하고 마을공동체 운영이 활발하며 단독가구가 주를 이루는 주택의 특징, 개개인의 아이덴티티를 중요시하는 주민의 특성을 고려하여 옆집과 다른 자신만의 아름다운 집의 색을 선택할 수 있도록 하였다. 본 연구를 통해 우리나라 농촌의 색채계획은 자연경관과의 조화를 우선시하며 일방적인 계획이 아닌 거주자의 선택이 가능해야 하며 시간의 변화에 따라 혹은 거주자의 변화에 따라 전체적인 조화 안에서 건축물의 색채도 변해야 색채계획이 지속될 수 있음을 알리고자 한다.",,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,1226-6450,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2012-01-01,KJD:ART001716863,,

Advances in information technology are increasing the use of radar as a tool to investigate and monitor bird migration movements. We set up a field campaign to compare and validate outputs from different radar systems. 2. Here we compare the pattern of nocturnal bird migration movements recorded by four different radar systems at a site in southern Sweden. Within the range of the weather radar (WR) Angelholm, we operated a BirdScan (BS) dedicated bird radar, a standard marine radar (MR), and a tracking radar (TR). 3. The measures of nightly migration intensities, provided by three of the radars (WR, BS, MR), corresponded well with respect to the relative seasonal course of migration, while absolute migration intensity agreed reasonably only between WR and BS. Flight directions derived from WR, BS and TR corresponded very well, despite very different sample sizes. Estimated mean ground speeds differed among all four systems. The correspondence among systems was highest under clear sky conditions and at high altitudes. 4. Synthesis and applications. While different radar systems can provide useful information on nocturnal bird migration, they have distinct strengths and weaknesses, and all require supporting data to allow for species level inference. Weather radars continuously detect avian biomass flows across a wide altitude band, making them a useful tool for monitoring and predictive applications at regional to continental scales that do not rely on resolving individuals. BirdScan and marine radars strengths are in local and low altitude applications, such as collision risks with man-made structures and airport safety, although marine radars should not be trusted for absolute intensities of movement. In quantifying flight behaviour of individuals, tracking radars are the most informative. mtr_gs_trackMean migration traffic rate (MTR), ground speed (GS) and track direction (track) per night during the campaign.

The study identified the commercial species by the VPUE of each species from catches, and analyzed the different species abundance and richness between sites. Nonmetric multidimensional scaling (MDS) was used to analyze the difference of composition of VPUE from variety of sites. Difference was shown in commercial species abundance and richness between reefs and control area. Differences were shown in commercial species abundance and richness between locations.

In the near-shore marine environments of the southeastern USA the addition of hard substrates into primarily salt marsh habitats may provide necessary settlement sites for recently introduced marine invertebrates such as the Asian green mussel, Perna viridis, and the South American charru mussel, Mytella charruana. Preliminary studies in Florida suggest that M. charruana adults are predominantly found on man-made substrates, especially docks. The present study investigated whether P. viridis and M. charruana preferentially settle on substrates commonly used in man-made structures such as plexiglass, wood and rock, or on natural substrates like the shells of oyster (Crassostrea virginica), green mussels or charru mussels. Frames containing a mixture of these six substrates were deployed at two locations in Florida and retrieved after 1, 2 and 3 months. Over 1-month deployments, both species preferentially recruited to natural substrates. While this pattern was repeated on substrates in the field for 2 months in M. charruana, there were no differences in P. viridis spat density among any of the substrates in the field for 2 or 3 months.

J,,,,,,,,,,,Feasibility Study for the Commercialisation of a Ferrite-Based Permanent Magnet Generator for the UK Onshore Wind Market,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Awarded Grant,Sep 30 2020,2020,"The purpose of the project is to conduct a Feasibility Study (phase 1) on the development of a multi-MW generator for the UK onshore wind market. The intention is that when customer requirements are confirmed that GreenSpur will submit a phase 2 application to develop and demonstrate the multi-MW generator. This will result in a new UK generator technology researched, developed, built and tested by a new and high value UK supply chain. The outcome will be of strategic benefit to the wider UK economy, as the disruption caused by the Covid-19 pandemic has severely impacted global supply chains, stalled the deployment of UK wind turbines and exposed a long-term UK reliance on European OEMs. The development of the generator in phase 2 will act as a steppingstone to the UK offshore wind turbine market. GreenSpur's proposed solution is: 1) Highly innovative, as it uses raw materials that are cheaper and more sustainably sourced than this used in current state of the art technologies. 2) Practical and deliverable, as phase 1 will assess and confirm a customer specification and phase 2 will engage with a motivated UK supply chain to develop a confirmed market requirement. 3) Cost competitive solution, as it uses ferrite magnets, which are abundant and cheap, in substitution of a rare earth ones, which are scarce and expensive. 4) A sustainable innovation that will be supported by a new and environmentally clean UK supply chain. The project will address the UK Government's decarbonising energy, business and industry theme contained with its Clean Growth Strategy, as GreenSpur's generator has been designed to produce low cost renewable energy from wind turbines. This stated aim of Ensuring the UK is the Best Place for Low Carbon Innovators to operate. Consistent with this objective, GreenSpur's generator technology will (1) reduce the cost of offshore wind energy and (2) support the UK's ambition to become a global leader in low carbon innovation. Adopting this approach will leverage private sector investment, create strong international partnerships and create export opportunities. Two secondary themes to the project are: 1) Enhancing the benefits and value of our natural resources, which is achieved by the substitution of rare earth magnets for ferrite within the generator. 2) Climate change adaption and mitigation, which is achieved by increasing the amount of renewable energy generated to offset carbon emissions and contribute to the UK Government's net zero by 2050 target.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,78325,,,,,,,,Time to Act Limited,Time to Act Limited,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:15405759,,

However, the attenuation of light is significantly more pronounced in water than in air or in space, and so in order to obtain underwater images in colour, it is typically necessary to be within 2 to 3m of the seafloor. In addition to the high risk of collision when operating underwater vehicles at such low altitudes, the limited area of the seafloor covered in each image means large area surveys require a huge investment of time. In this research, we aim to increase the efficiency of mapping large areas of the seafloor by developing an underwater imaging system that can take colour images at ranges of up to 12 m, so that each image can cover a larger area, together with the necessary algorithms to automatically process the data it obtains. The system was applied multiple times at sea, among others during two research cruises to the hydrothermally active Iheya-North field in the Okinawa Trough, which took place in October 2012 and January 2014. Data from these two surveys allows assessment of changes in the environment that occurred during 15 months. During the time between the two surveys deposits from the hydrothermal fluids grew into small chimneys on top of a man-made hydrothermal vent, providing a measure of the hydrothermal activity.

Jernej (Debeli rtic), Strunjan and Piran (Secovlje). A total of 3,110 buoys were counted and categorized into two groups according to their shape (horizontal and vertical) and colours. The black horizontally floating buoys were of two types (barrel-shaped and oval). The Shags chose to utilize the horizontally floating buoys only, most often black and white in colour. Owing to their poorer stability and smaller standing surface, the vertically floating buoys are clearly unsuitable for them. The highest share of Shags with regard to the number of buoys of separate types was registered on black barrel-shaped buoys. As the percentage of occupied buoys was similar at all roost sites (36-39%), it was deduced that Shags distribute evenly among roosts, regardless of the number of individuals present in the Slovenian sea. At the larger roost at Debeli rtic, the percentage of adult individuals (73.5%) was greater than at Strunjan (42.5%). This could be due to the competition for better places, given that competitively stronger individuals select safer larger roosts.

The objective of this work is to provide an assessment of the extension of the C. fragile invasion along the coast of Chile, and characterize the pattern of temporal fluctuations in abundance, and potential economic effects of this algal invader in a Gracilaria chilensis farm in northern Chile. In 2005 we recorded C. fragile at 34 of 123 sites sampled along the Chilean coast, with over half of the invaded sites occurring between 26 degrees and 30 degrees S latitude. At 12 sites C. fragile was present only on artificial substrata, suggesting that artificial structures may act as corridors for the dispersal of this alga into subtidal or intertidal habitats where it is otherwise not able to survive. At one site (Calderilla Bay) C. fragile has reached high levels of abundance within G. chilensis farms. At this site we observed marked seasonality in the monthly C. fragile abundance index, with greater C. fragile abundances in summer and fall months, associated with higher sea surface temperatures (SST). In addition, we report a significant long-term trend of increasing C. fragile abundances over the 5 years of observations in the plantation. If the distribution of C fragile in Chile is largely determined by SST, we expect faster spread of northern populations towards the north. Weedy species had a negative effect on the farmed species, G. chilensis. During the 4 months in which algae wet weights were measured, the estimated C fragile biomass averaged 22.9 kg m(-2), compared with an estimated average of 18.5 kg m(-2) of the harvested red alga, G. chilensis. In addition, we recorded a negative effect of C. fragile abundances on the Catch Per Unit Effort (CPUE) of G. chilensis with a significant upper limit to CPUE at the 94th quantile. Since weedy species generate a great loss of time and money in G. chilensis farms, it is likely that without intervention, the costs associated with the C. fragile invasion threaten the persistence of G. chilensis farms in northern Chile. Stakeholders should implement preventative measures to stop C. fragile spread from focal points. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

Our study focused on the role of substrate type, timing and duration of submersion as determinants of fouling assemblage. We used plates made of basalt, concrete or fibreglass, to assess early, i.e., 3 months, and late, i.e., 12 months, succession in benthic communities. To assess spatial and temporal variability of the results, sampling was performed at 2 locations and the experiment was repeated in two seasons of the year. Our results showed that the timing and duration of submersion affected the number and percent cover of natives and NIS, as well as assemblage composition. Moreover, the present study showed no support for the hypothesis that marine NIS are more abundant on artificial substrata, as neither of the two artificial substrata tested supported a greater number of NIS compared to basalt (the natural substratum). Overall, fibreglass presented the most different benthic assemblage composition, supporting the fact that the extent and nature of the observed differences varied not only between natural and artificial substrata, but also according to the type of artificial habitat considered. Thus, our results are in agreement with previous studies that stated that appropriate strategies for environmental management should integrate ecological assessment in order to maintain natural patterns of distribution and abundance of organisms, scales of variability and relevant ecological processes.

As new fisheries develop. it is critical for environmental managers to have high quality ecological information regarding the potential impacts, in order to develop sound management strategies. Crab-tiling is a largely unregulated and un-researched fishery, which operates commercially in the south-west UK. The target species is the green crab Carcinus maenas. Those crabs which are pre-ecdysis and have a carapace width greater than 40 mm are collected to be sold to recreational anglers as bait. Collection involves laying artificial structures on intertidal sandflats and mudflats in estuaries. Crabs use these structures as refugia and are collected during low tide. However, the effect that this fishery has on populations of C. maenas is not known. The impact of crab-tiling on C. maenas population structure was determined by sampling crabs from tiled estuaries and non-tiled estuaries using baited drop-nets. A spatially and temporarily replicated, balanced design was used to compare crab abundance. sizes and sex ratios between estuaries. Typically, fisheries are associated with a reduction in the abundance of the target species. Crab-tiling. however, significantly increased C. maenas abundance. This was thought to be a result of the extra habitat in tiled estuaries, which probably provides protection from natural predators, such as birds and fish. Although crabs were more abundant in tiled estuaries than non-tiled estuaries, the overall percentage of reproductively active crabs in non-tiled estuaries was greater than in tiled estuaries. As with most exploited fisheries stocks, crabs in exploited (tiled) estuaries tended to be smaller, with a modal carapace width of 20-29 mm rather than 30-39 mm in non-tiled estuaries. The sex ratio of crabs however; was not significantly different between tiled and non-tiled estuaries. These results illustrate the potential to manage fished populations using habitat provision to mitigate the effects of fishing pressure. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Quantifying the use of artificial reefs by recreational boaters is essential for determining their value as ecosystem services. In this study, four artificial-natural reef pairs in the eastern Gulf of Mexico (off western Florida) were investigated for boat visitation rates using autonomous acoustic recorders. Digital SpectroGram (DSG) recorders were used to collect sound files from April 2013 to March 2015. An automatic detection algorithm was used to identify boat noise in individual files using the harmonic peaks generated by boat engines, and by comparing the sound amplitude of each file with surrounding files. In all four pairs, visitation rates were significantly higher at the artificial reef than the natural reef. This increase in boat visitation was likely due to actual or perceived increased quality of fishing and diving at the artificial reefs, or to lack of knowledge of the presence or locations of the natural reefs. Inshore reefs (25 m depth). This study appears to be the first to use acoustic data to measure participant use of boating destinations, and highlights the utility of acoustic monitoring for the valuation of this important ecosystem service provided by artificial reefs.

Using surface trawls, we monitored prey abundance before and after construction of a 30 turbine offshore wind farm sited close to an internationally important colony of Little terns. Observations confirmed that young-of-the-year clupeids dominated chick diet, which trawl samples suggested were mainly herring. Multivariate modelling indicated a significant reduction in herring abundance from 2004 onwards that could not be explained by environmental factors. Intensely noisy monopile installation during the winter spawning period was suggested to be responsible. Reduced prey abundance corresponded with a significant decline in Little tern foraging success. Unprecedented egg abandonment and lack of chick hatching tentatively suggested a colony-scale response in some years. We urge a precautionary approach to the timing and duration of pile-driving activity supported with long-term targeted monitoring of sensitive receptors. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Uses of stabilized wastes are considered in the areas of habitat restoration, coastal defense and fishery enhancement. It is suggested that rehabilitation of marine dump sites receiving loose waste such as pulverized fuel ash (PFA) could be enhanced by the continued dumping of the material but in a stabilized block form, so creating new habitat diversity. Global warming predictions include sea level rise and increased storm frequency. This is of particular concern along the southern and eastern coasts of the U.K. The emphasis of coastal defenses is changing from ''hard'' seawalls to ''soft'' options which include offshore barriers to reduce wave energy reaching the coast.

These alternate with rocky shares and natural beaches. The length and characteristics of each of these two natural and three artificial types of shore have been determined from data digitized from maps, aerial photographs and held work, and processed using various computer software. A principal components analysis, carefully interpreted in the light of information gathered during the study, brings out the opposition or complementarity between the various types of shore. The analysis of these relationships also briefly highlights the socio-economic and physical factors that have favoured artificial shoreline development. The former are related to pressure generated by massive population and tourism-based economic growth, while the latter are associated with the geology and geomorphology of this coast. Seventy-five to eighty-five percent of artificial shores have been created at the expense of natural beaches, many of which have been disadvantaged by their coarse elastic composition, narrowness, erosional tendencies and poor recreational value. Natural beaches have, therefore, been prone to so-called ''shots valorization'', a process that has been synonymous with the proliferation of yachting harbours and fill structures. Pressure an these benches has been exacerbated by the fact that rocky shores, the only other natural shore type, account for over 52% of the present Riviera shoreline and are much more expensive to transform. The 14 artificial benches created in the last two decades have compensated for only 1% of the natural benches eaten up by artificial structures.",,,,,,,,,19,0,0,0,4,1,21,,,0749-0208,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1994-12-01,WOS:A1994MV81600005,,

The suggested improvement utilises the information found in replicated samples in order to obtain more precise estimates of the pollution.Simultaneously, the uncertainties of the pollution estimates are quantified. This is obtained by making pseudo samples by randomly permuting the counts of the species observed within a group of replicates. The pseudo samples are representative for the variation at the sampling site since the permutations are both species specific and restricted to replicates within the sampling site.The pollution is quantified by a modelling approach. Sediment samples are collected in an area surrounding a contamination source, e.g. an oilrig. The non-polluted samples are used to build a linear model of the natural variation in the survey area. The remaining samples are projected onto the calculated model. Then, the distance from the projection to the sample gives an estimate of the pollution in the current sample. The last part of the work is devoted to investigate the robustness of the suggested improvements to pollution quantification from benthic count data. This is done by means of perturbations, and it appears that the modifications give both reliable and robust results.

Despite its acclaimed utility, estuarine environment and ecosystems in Korea have been severely destroyed almost beyond restoration as a result of ill-considered development/use-oriented estuarine policies, installation of various artificial structures including estuary bank, etc. Consequently, majority of large scale estuaries in Korea have almost completely lost their inherent nature and functions, all the while still facing heavy pressure for development and use. Meanwhile, several developed countries, including the U.S., UK, etc., have established estuary management system and implemented laws and integrated management programs concerning protection/conservation, improvement and restoration of estuarine environment.In this respect Korea has recently been implementing a research and development (R&D) project titled 「Development of Integrated Estuarine Management System」, funded by the Ministry of Oceans and Fisheries, Korea, to develop an integrated and systematic regime for restoration and management of estuaries in not only legal and institutional, but also scientific and technical aspects.

In this paper, the dynamics of the four ice floes are explored in terms of the relative proportions which were forced by the wind, current, sea surface topography, Coriolis, and internal stress gradients. The internal ice stress gradients are calculated as residuals between the observed accelerations of the floes as measured by the tracking buoys and the sums of the other metocean forcings. Results show that internal ice stress gradients accounted for up to 50% of the observed forcing on the floes, and may have reached up to around 0.19 kPa.",,,,,,,,,6,0,0,0,0,0,6,,,2169-9275,2169-9291,,,,,,,,,,"C CORE, Captain Robert A Bartlett Bldg, St John, NF, CanadaMUN, Fac Engn & Appl Sci, St John, NF, Canada",C COREMUN,,,2017-09-22,WOS:000409893600043,,

J,,,,,,,,,Santana Madabhushi,,Cyclic Behaviour of Monopile Foundations for Offshore Wind Farms,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Awarded Grant,Jun 30 2010,2010,"Offshore wind farms are gaining popularity in the UK due to the current interest in the need for greener energy sources, security of energy supply and to the public's reluctance to have wind farms on-shore. Offshore wind farms often contain hundreds of turbines supported at heights of 30m to 50m. The preferred foundations for these tall structures are large diameter monopiles due to their ease of construction in shallow to medium water depths. These monopiles are subjected to large cyclic, lateral and moment loads in addition to axial loads. It is anticipated that each of these foundations will see many millions of cycles of loading during their design life. In coastal waters around the UK, it is common for these monopiles to pass through shallow layers of soft, poorly consolidated marine clays before entering into stiffer clay/sand strata. One of the biggest concerns with the design of monopiles is their behaviour under very large numbers of cycles of lateral and moment loads. The current design methods rely heavily on stiffness degradation curves for clays available in the literature that were primarily derived for earthquake loading on relatively small diameter piles with relatively small numbers of cycles of loading. Extrapolation of this stiffness deterioration to large diameter piles with large numbers of cycles of loading represents the key risk factor in assessing the performance of offshore wind turbines. Further research is therefore required. The proposed project aims to understand the behaviour of large diameter monopiles driven through clay layers of contrasting stiffness and subjected to cyclic lateral and moment loading. Centrifuge model tests will be conducted taking advantage of recent developments at the Schofield Centre that include a computer-controlled 2-D actuator that can apply both force or displacement controlled cyclic loading to monopiles in-flight. In addition it is possible to carry out in-flight installation of the monopiles to simulate the insertion of these monopiles into the seabed. New equipment will be developed for the in-flight measurement of soil stiffness and dynamic response comparative to the state-of-the-art equipment which is now used in the field. The main outcome of the project will be a better understanding of the response of the monopiles in layered soil systems to large number of loading cycles (lateral and moment loads). The results will be directly compared to the current design practices and guidelines for improved design will be developed. The outcome of this project will allow an accurate estimation of the behaviour of offshore monopile foundations under very large numbers of cycles of loading, thus leading to a confident estimation of the life cycle of the foundation. This is critical in determining the economic viability of an offshore wind farm given that the capital costs are high and the revenue stream is relatively low but continues for the life of the wind farm.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,EP/H013857/1,,,,,,,,University of Cambridge,,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:15398710,,

The artificial reefs were exposed to the marine environment near Shique Beach, Qingdao, in May 2017. We collected samples to analyze the effect of different reef materials on organism attachment on the artificial reef in July, September, November, 2017 and January 2018. The results showed that, in total, 69 species of attached organisms were identified. The numbers of species on ordinary portland cement, scallop portland cement, and iron plate reefs were 51, 53, and 31, respectively. The dominant species on the ordinary portland cement and scallop portland cement reefs were Caprella sp., Ostrea plicatula, and Mytilusgallo provincialis; the dominant species on iron plate reefs were Caprella sp., M. provincialis, and Stenothoe qingdaoensis. Biological attachment peaked between September and November. We found the highest average biomass of fouling organisms on scallop portland cement (4717.50 g/m2), followed by ordinary portland cement (2621.12 g/m2), and iron plates (163.85 g/m2). In July 2017, the Shannon-Wiener diversity index (H') of fouling organisms was observed to follow the order P>S>F; in September 2017, the order was S>P>F; in November 2017, the order was P>S>F; and in January 2018, the order was F>P>S.

PP presented a relative total abundance of 7,088.8 individuals and T 5,523.8 individuals. This difference was related to the greater volume and structural complexity in PP. The families with the greatest species numbers were also of high economic importance (Haemulidae, Lutjanidae, Serranidae, and Carangidae). The species with the greater relative abundance were Anchoa sp. in PP and Ophistonema oglinum in T. The assemblages showed high similarity in composition, resident category and dynamics, which relates with the stability of environmental conditions and similar location and design of the ARs. During the monitoring, the fish assemblages accumulated species and individuals in a non-systematic pattern in the group of non-resident species, as defined here, but the ARs should be close to their carrying capacity. There is circumstantial evidence of the biomass production potential of the ARs (development of residents) besides their aggregating effect.

J,,,,,,,,,Maurizio Collu,,Investigation of the novel challenges of an integrated offshore multi-purpose platform,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Awarded Grant,Jul 31 2018,2018,"The Made in China 2025 report, highlights ocean renewable energy technologies as one of the 10 areas of opportunity for UK and Chinese companies. The Outline of the National Marine Economic Development Plan specifically targets the development of novel ocean farming methods, more productive but also more socially and environmentally compatible. In the EU, the Blue Growth program aims at sustainable growth in the marine and maritime sectors, already representing 5.4 million jobs and generating a gross added value of 500 billion euros a year. Offshore structures are very costly. The main idea of a Multi-Purpose Platform (MPP), integrating (for example) renewable energy devices and aquaculture facilities, is to find the synergies to share manufacturing, installation, operation and maintenance, and decommissioning costs.This has the potential to, save money, reduce the overall impact, and maximize the socio-economic benefits.MPP development poses cross-disciplinary challenges, since they simultaneously aim to achieve several potentially conflicting objectives: to be techno-economically feasible, environmentally considered, socially beneficial, and compatible with maritime legislations. In the EU, previous research focused on farms of multi-megawatt MPP (ocean renewable devices + aquaculture systems), with very few/no attempts to investigate lower rated power systems suitable for island/coastal communities. In China, previous projects aimed at island communities focused on renewable energy, but they did not integrate any aquaculture elements.Therefore, for island communities, novel fundamental questions arise, especially in terms of techno-economic feasibility and assessment and maximization of socio-environmental benefits at a completely different scale, but still requiring a whole-system, cross-disciplinary approach.The proposed solution is to investigate which are the specific challenges arising from the integration of these different offshore technologies, and with a multi-disciplinary approach to tackle them, making sure that all the dimensions (technological, economic, social, environmental, legal) are taken into account.The renewable energy technologies (Which wind turbine? Which wave device? What kind of solar panel?) and aquaculture systems most suitable for the needs of an island community will be identified, and the cross-disciplinary questions will be defined, e.g. What is the impact of the noise generated by the renewable energy devices on the (closely co-located) aquaculture species growth rate?.Answering these questions, the novel contribution will consist in developing approaches to assess the feasibility of an MPP system, focusing on: global MPP dynamic response to metocean conditions, overall integrated control and power management strategies, environmental impact, socio-economic risks and benefits.The potential of these methodologies will be then show-cased through two case-studies, one focusing on an island community in China, and one in the UK.This consortium brings together internationally recognised experts from three Chinese and three British universities and institutes, for a total of 20 investigators, in the fields of solar and offshore wind and wave energy, control systems for renewable energy devices, environmental and socio-economic impact of renewables and aquaculture systems, aquaculture and integrated multi-trophic aquaculture development, and ecosystem modelling.

A total of 8,524 prosobranch gastropods, including 12 dominant taxa, were collected as post-larval, juvenile, and adult individuals. In general the amount of variability explained by the type of habitat slightly dominated over seasonal variation, which was outweighed by variation from month to month, to explain colonization patterns. Throughout the study, larger numbers of colonizers of Bittium spp. (Leach in Gray, 1847), Columbella adansoni (Menke, 1853), Gibberula caelata (Monterosato, 1877), Mitra spp. (Lamarck, 1798), Rissoa spp. (Freminville in Desmarest, 1814), and Smaragdia viridis (Linnaeus, 1758) were observed in artificial substrates deployed in vegetated substrates, highlighting the relevance of vegetation as a matrix habitat for subtidal prosobranch gastropods. Cerithium rupestre (Risso, 1986) and Clavatula mystica (Reeve, 1843), however, were mainly observed on sandy patches. Rissoa spp. showed a peak in the arrival of new colonizers during spring-early summer whereas Tricolia pullus canarica (Nordsieck, 1973) showed a peak during winter-early spring. Importantly, the other prosobranch gastropods did not show significant differences in the arrival of colonizers between annual seasons. In summary, these results demonstrate that seasonality is strongly outweighed by small-scale temporal variability (here variation from month to month) and the type of habitat patch as drivers of prosobranch gastropod colonization patterns in coastal landscapes.",,,,,,,,,5,0,0,0,5,0,5,,,0740-2783,2162-2698,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Las Palmas Gran Canaria, Marine Sci Fac, Dept Biol, BIOGES Ctr Biodiversidad & Gest Ambiental, Gran Canaria 35017, Canary Islands, SpainGobierno Canarias, Viceconsejeria Medioambiente, Gran Canaria, Canary Islands, Spain",Gobierno Canarias,,,2014-08-12,WOS:000338771000006,,

Extensive hydrographic measurements were carried out at the Northern North Sea (NNS) station, located at (59degrees20N, 1degreesE). The collected data are used to validate the model results, showing an acceptable agreement between modelled temperatures and those obtained from CTDs and moored thermistors. This is valid both for surface and bottom temperatures, while the mixed layer thickness appears to be underestimated. A series of 3-D runs, testing different turbulence schemes, an internal wave mixing (IWM) parameterisation and the sensitivity to an increase of the surface stress, have been performed with the aim of assessing the relative importance of the advective and mixing processes. The model comparisons mostly evidenced differences in the behaviour of the bottom layer temperature during the last part of the year, which may be due to advection processes. The adoption of an internal wave mixing parameterisation, though managing to reproduce a deeper thermocline, overestimates the mixing around the period of the thermocline breakdown. The run adopting a wind stress increased by 50% provides a better agreement between observed and modelled thermocline. This applies also for surface velocities when compared to Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler (ADCP) measurements, while the bottom ones appear slightly underestimated only in the U-component. The Northern North Sea site appears to be located close to a gyre induced by thermal fronts. Comparisons with nearby wind data measured by an oil rig and by the ships operating in the area seem to confirm that the wind forcing values adopted during the integration are underestimated.

Artificial reefs have been looked into as potential solutions for creation of surf waves. Recently, artificial reefs are being examined as soft solutions for coastal protection. Conventional hard approaches like construction of sea wall, groins, revetments, bulkheads and break waters have been successful over the past. However, they may sometimes create adverse impacts on the coastal environment. Thus, employing artificial reefs for shore protection would yield multiple benefits as they attenuate the waves away from shoreline and does not interact with the shoreline directly. Because of this, they are often called multipurpose reefs. Construction of reefs has been primarily based on geo bags and geo tubes. Sometimes, rubble mound construction has been used. However, there are construction and handling difficulties. Hence, gabions may be considered in artificial reefs due to their ease of construction and porous nature. Gabions also reduce the construction time, hence making it suitable to construct during adverse weather window. The porosity of gabions may also add favorable effects on the near shore environment. On the other hand, several installations of artificial reefs over the past decade have faced severe stability issues. Since literatures relevant to artificial reef are scanty, the present study brings out the experimental measurement of pressures on Gabion Boxes as artificial reefs. In order to relate the pressure to stability, pressures are measured over units at critical locations. An attempt has been made to use the measured pressures to obtain forces and thus stability factors of Gabion Box units in reef applications. The pressure measurement is made varying, the reef parameters and wave parameters. The purpose of varying the reef parameters (width of reef and height of the reef) is to come out with the optimum configuration of reef for a given wave climate. The pressure measurement corresponding to a particular reef configuration is presented in the paper. (C) 2015 The Authors.

We tagged 2,932 individuals with internal anchor tags during 28 tagging trips made to nine artificial reef sites from March 1995 to July 1998. Recaptures of tagged fish were made on subsequent tagging trips (n = 235) by the authors and were reported by recreational and commercial fishers (n = 364 through December 2000). Annual site fidelity o tagged fish to individual reefs was estimated with nonlinear decay models of the decline in recaptures made by the authors at tagging sites over time.

Overall, adult red snapper tagged in our study demonstrated lower site Fidelity and greater movement than previously reported. Low site fidelity may explain spatial and temporal variability in red snapper biomass observed around reefs and has important implications for red snapper management. In particular, our results do not support the hypothesis that artificial reefs have increased red snapper production, as artificial reefs are more likely merely to attract reef fishes that demonstrate low site fidelity and only partial or opportunistic reef dependency.

Since the reef shape of each unit structure gives a different shadow area, void space and surface area thus attracting different fish species, it is important to select the best structural design, with a limited funding for each site, for optimization of fish habitat according to the target species and environmental factors. In order to establish effective fishing ground environment equipment and artificial reef in coastal area, the methodology to select the optimal site for artificial reef should be applied after analyzing the correlation between fishing ground environment and ocean environment. In this paper, thematic maps were prepared using remote sensing and geographical Information System(GIS) for the physical and geological conditions which are considered as the most elements when selecting optimal site for artificial reef in coastal waters of Korea.The results showed it makes possible for this methodology, which selects the optimal site for artificial reef using remote sensing and GIS, to manage the institution of artificial reef more entirely and efficiently through analyzing and visualizing.",,,,,15th International Offshore and Polar Engineering Conference (ISOPE 2005)15th International Offshore and Polar Engineering Conference (ISOPE 2005),"JUN 19-24, 2005JUN 19-24, 2005",,"Seoul, SOUTH KOREASeoul, SOUTH KOREA",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,1098-6189,,*************,,,,,,,,,"Yosu Natl Univ, Dept Ocean Engn, Yeosu, Jeonnam, South Korea",,,,2005-01-01,WOS:000232030600045,,

The idea of using an artificial reef as a model of a natural reef in statu nascendi has led to fundamental knowledge of the development of a coral reef. Over more than 20 years, it has been possible to observe the successive structural and ecological processes involved for the first time. In view of the scope and duration of the study, the use of this artificial reef clearly stands out from other so-called artificial reefs. Other purposes than basic reef research for which artificial reefs are used include an increase in fishery yields, the protection and development of macrophyte stands, coastal protection, attractions for diving tourism, and reef rehabilitation by prostheses. The use of the term artificial reef for structures incompatible with current definitions of coral reef is rejected. One insight in initial reef development gained from the reef models is that settlement and growth of corals on the one hand and the activity of grazers on the other hand result in the formation of a disjunct pattern of diversity with nuclei of high structural complexity and species number. They become protoreef communities, the empty areas between then slowly are encroached by those coral patches. This principle of nucleation is translated into practical measures in a new approach to rehabilitate and restore degraded coral reefs. Artificial mini-reefs are formed by electrochemical precipitation of calcium-carbonate from the seawater onto an aptly formed wire matrix and by transplantation of coral nubbins thereon. The community of coral tranplants and newly settled recruits may function as stepping stones to repopulate mechanically devastated reef areas. Recent experiments on the use of minireefs as reef prostheses in the Red Sea near Ras Muhamed are presented.",,,,,,,,,9,2,0,0,10,0,12,,,0302-671X,,,,,,,,,,,"Abteilung Hydrobiologie, Universitaet Essen, Institut fuer Oekologie, D-45117, Essen, Germany",,,,2002-01-01,ZOOREC:ZOOR13800047205,,

As part of a broader examination of the efficacy of this approach, a tagging study was conducted at a subset (n=9) of these unreported artificial reefs to examine the likelihood that reef fishes would remain associated with them and to test factors affecting species-specific movement. Quarterly tagging trips (n=12) were made between March 2005 and December 2007 during which 3109 fish among 12 species were tagged with internal anchor tags. Red snapper (Lutjanus campechanus, n=2114), gray triggerfish (Balistes capriscus, n=267), and groupers (Family: Serranidae, n=148), were among the most frequently tagged fishes. Eighty-six fish were recaptured on subsequent tagging trips and fishermen reported 249 recaptures caught away from study sites. Mean (SD) distance moved among recaptures with reported recapture location was 37.1 (6.6) km for red snapper (n=173), 8.8 (3.1) km for gray triggerfish (n=47), and 25.2 (14.9) km for groupers (n=26). During the study, a hurricane passed over the study area, thus adding an unplanned factor to movement analyses. Fish size, reef depth, time free, and hurricane exposure significantly affected the likelihood of red snapper movement (p<0.020), but only fish size significantly affected distance moved (p=0.036). No factors significantly affected gray triggerfish movement, and low sample size precluded statistical tests of grouper movement. Overall, results indicate that large scale (>100 km) red snapper movement was not dependent on hurricane occurrence, while gray triggerfish displayed mostly limited (<10 km) movement irrespective of factors tested. The scale of movement observed suggests the efficacy of unreported artificial reefs to serve as no-harvest refuges is doubtful, especially when regional fishing mortality is high. Marine protected areas may be an effective alternative approach to facilitate the recovery of overfished stocks, but would need to be expansive to account for reef fish movement.

In particular the hydraulic problems concerning to this study are the wave control and tractive force which induces the sediment transport. Their hydraulic characteristics are revealed experimentally in this research(1) Ohashi and Kainou constructed the fixed bed model of the pocket beaches, which are commonly seen at the islands in the Seto Inland Sea, in the coastal wave test basin (20m*15m). The model is scaled down to one-fortieth of the prototype. Mainly to control the waves by setting the permeable offshore breakwater, which can function as fish reef, the experiments with the regular waves were conducted. From the experimental results, it was clear the effect of the improvement, was recognized only around the center of the breakwater. Because the existences of the fishing port and the small promontory at both sides of the pocket beach affect largely the wave condition in it. Therefore, further improvement were examined. Considering the complex wave characteristics (e.g.three dimensional diffracted wave and the distribution of overtopping rate, and etc.), the optimal length and opening width of breakwater were finally decided.(2) Ohashi and Fujihara experimented the decay of wave height by setting the four types of reefs (step type and bar type with 30cm, 50cm, 70cm of crown width) in the irregular wave test tank. The experiments under two different energy levels with 7-9 cases of water level (2cm interval) were conducted and wave heights were measured at 8 points.

The immediate causes of incidents identified include inadequacies in planning, risk assessment, design and practices. The prevailing root cause is a lack of knowledge and skills of the people involved, but also deficiencies in contractor selection and project management. According to experienced stakeholders, basic project and risk management should be improved in many of the new organisations entering the growing offshore wind market. The unavailability of dedicated work standards is herein a clear obstacle to successful cable projects. Better knowledge management is hindered by inability and unwillingness to share the lessons learned among the organisations.

Coral communities were characterized using belt transects, conducted on 34- and 14-year-old unplanned AR, and on two proximate NR. Stony corals were the major component in the NR, while soft corals, mainly Nephtheidae, accounted for up to 90% of the total living coverage in the AR. This was attributed to physical and biological features associated with the AR's vertical orientation, which was absent in the NR, and to the life history traits of these soft corals.

To examine potential impacts on native reef fish communities, lionfish density and size distributions were estimated from fall 2010 to fall 2013 with a remotely operated vehicle at natural (n = 16) and artificial (n = 22) reef sites. Lionfish (n = 934) also were sampled via spearfishing to examine effects of habitat type, season, and fish size on their diet and trophic ecology. There was an exponential increase in lionfish density at both natural and artificial reefs over the study period. By fall 2013, mean lionfish density at artificial reefs (14.7 fish 100 m(-2)) was two orders of magnitude higher than at natural reefs (0.49 fish 100 m(-2)), and already was among the highest reported in the western Atlantic. Lionfish diet was significantly different among habitats, seasons, and size classes, with smaller (<250 mm total length) fish consuming more benthic invertebrates and the diet of lionfish sampled from artificial reefs being composed predominantly of non-reef associated prey. The ontogenetic shift in lionfish feeding ecology was consistent with delta N-15 values of white muscle tissue that were positively related to total length. Overall, diet results indicate lionfish are generalist mesopredators in the nGOM that become more piscivorous at larger size. However, lionfish diet was much more varied at artificial reef sites where they clearly were foraging on open substrates away from reef structure. These results have important implications for tracking the lionfish invasion in the nGOM, as well as estimating potential direct and indirect impacts on native reef fish communities in this region.",,,,,,,,,97,0,0,0,89,6,116,,,1932-6203,,,,,,,,,,,"Univ S Alabama, Dept Marine Sci, Mobile, AL 36688 USA",,,,2014-08-29,WOS:000341127500073,25170922,

Similar reefs have also since been placed in other regions of Australia. Studies indicate that these reefs have increased both primary productivity and the number of fish available for recreational fishers. Most artificial reefs placed in Australian waters have been for recreational use by either divers or anglers.

As tidal currents move past the OWF foundation structures they generate a turbulent wake that will contribute to a mixing of the stratified water column. In this study we show that the mixing generated in this way may have a significant impact on the large-scale stratification of the German Bight region of the North Sea. This region is chosen as the focus of this study since the planning of OWFs is particularly widespread. Using a combination of idealised modelling and in situ measurements, we provide order-of-magnitude estimates of two important time scales that are key to understanding the impacts of OWFs: (i) a mixing time scale, describing how long a complete mixing of the stratification takes, and (ii) an advective time scale, quantifying for how long a water parcel is expected to undergo enhanced wind farm mixing. The results are especially sensitive to both the drag coefficient and type of foundation structure, as well as the evolution of the pycnocline under enhanced mixing conditions-both of which are not well known. With these limitations in mind, the results show that OWFs could impact the large-scale stratification, but only when they occupy extensive shelf regions. They are expected to have very little impact on large-scale stratification at the current capacity in the North Sea, but the impact could be significant in future large-scale development scenarios.",,,,,,,,,53,0,0,0,23,0,54,,,1932-6203,,,,,,,,,,,"Helmholtz Zentrum Geesthacht, Inst Coastal Res, Geesthacht, GermanyMIT, Joint Program Oceanog Appl Ocean Sci & Engn, Woods Hole Oceanog Inst, Woods Hole, MA USA",,,,2016-08-11,WOS:000381381100076,27513754,

Although several studies have tested habitat enhancement interventions that incorporate novel water-retaining features into coastal defences, there remains a need for additional long-term, fully replicated trials to identify alternative cost-effective designs. We created artificial rock pools of two depths (12 cm, 5 cm) by drill-coring into a shore-parallel intertidal granite breakwater, to investigate their potential as an intervention for delivering ecological enhancement. After 18 months the artificial rock pools supported greater species richness than adjacent granite rock surfaces on the breakwater, and similar species richness to natural rock pools on nearby rocky shores. Community composition was, however, different between artificial and natural pools. The depth of artificial rock pools did not affect richness or community structure. Although the novel habitats did not support the same communities as natural rock pools, they clearly provided important habitat for several species that were otherwise absent at mid-shore height on the breakwater.

Detection in real time would then allow response personnel to contain spill pollution before extensive damage is done to wildlife, environment, public assets, and economic interests. This instrument may also provide select users (i.e. stormwater permit holders and petrochemical facility operators) with a new tool to meet regulatory requirements for spill prevention and reporting. Indeed any spill that is successfully prevented or minimized as a result of real time detection benefits not just the users of the sensor, but all waterway stakeholders, and the environment and society as a whole (in keeping with the One Ocean theme of this years Ocean's conference). for continuous monitoring (as opposed to periodic sampling intervals). In conclusion we summarize results from our testing and performance evaluations, and suggest a few goals for future design modifications and improvements.This paper describes: 1) Research and development of a reliable, economical, optical, non contact off-on-water petroleum detection sensor; 2) Experience, results and evaluations drawn from extensive laboratory testing, and real world performance, using a range of hydrocarbons and related products (and differing environmental conditions, concentrations, ranges, etc.); and finally, 3) Discussion of applications and deployment opportunities for which this technology provides a viable new tool as a preventative countermeasure and early warning system against potentially catastrophic oil spills.This paper discusses a number of objectives that were met during the development of this Slick Sleuth (TM) oil spill detection sensor. The sensor was proven to provide reliable detection signal even when only trace amounts or a very slight sheen of off was present. The design goal of a near-zero maintenance system was accomplished by use of a downward looking optical sensor installed above the water. This above water technique allowed us to eliminate all contact with in-water oil or debris, prevented biological or other fouling issues, and eliminated need for in-water mooring. The sensor was shown to provide successful consistent detection of petroleum on water when installed at 5 meters above (varying tidal) water surface, as well as at closer ranges and at fixed distances to the target area. This paper summarizes our investigation and testing of the limitations, strengths, sensitivity, and adaptability of the Slick Sleuth (TM) oil spill detection sensor as we attempted to determine its effectiveness in a wide range of deployment arrangements. A few target applications include monitoring for spills around/in or on offshore structures and buoys, coasts, ports and harbor, piers and marine terminals, industrial culverts/sumps and outfalls, inland waterways, etc. This paper also examines use of this optical sensor to detect off sheens in high current velocity regimes (i.e. 4 knots current speed), it's immunity to wave action, and the ability of the sensor to be used for continuous monitoring (as opposed to periodic sampling intervals).In conclusion we summarize results from our testing and performance evaluations, and suggest a few goals for future design modifications and improvements.",,,,,Oceans 2005 ConferenceOceans 2005 Conference,"SEP 17-23, 2005SEP 17-23, 2005",IEEEIEEE,"Washington, DCWashington, DC",8,0,0,0,2,0,8,,,0197-7385,,0-933957-34-3,,,,,,,,,"InterOcean Syst Inc, San Diego, CA 92123 USA",InterOcean Syst Inc,,,2005-01-01,WOS:000238978701064,,

Judging by this data, local PRs are positive towards the planned local RETs, while SHOs are less so. This emphasizes that potential RET project stakeholders and stakeholder groups may have very different RET project perceptions and opinions. The planned RET projects were subject to widespread critique in the public and political RET project related debate, but the documented PR RET project support was rather silent support. This is a noteworthy inconsistency calling for further research.

Seabird species exhibit different behavioural reactions to OWFs, ranging from avoidance resulting in habitat loss, to attraction causing an increased risk of colliding with the turbines. We investigated how OWFs affected the densities and distributions of guillemots and kittiwakes breeding in the southern North Sea and if the effects varied among seasons using a 'before-after control impact' (BACI) analysis approach based on a large-scale and long-term dataset covering 14 years before and 3 years after the construction of OWFs. Guillemot relative density in the OWF decreased by 63% in spring, and by 44% in the breeding season. Kittiwake relative density in the OWF decreased by 45% in the breeding season, and not significantly by 10% in spring. We furthermore estimated the response radii to the OWF for both species and seasons, finding that guillemots showed a response radius of similar to 9 km in spring and kittiwakes a radius of similar to 20 km in the breeding season. The results underline the value of large-scale and long-term assessments considering seasonal variation throughout the yearly cycle.

Coastal defense structures such as breakwaters are becoming recognized as large-scale artificial reefs that support abundant and diverse marine communities and play important roles in coastal ecology and management. However, there is limited understanding of how substrate materials used to construct artificial reefs or breakwaters can influence the development of habitat-forming benthic organisms. To assess the influence of substrata on coral recruitment and overall benthic community development, we deployed standard-size tiles of materials used in the construction of break-waters and artificial reefs (concrete, gabbro, granite, and sandstone), along with terra-cotta for comparative purposes, at two breakwaters (DDD, PRT) and two natural reef sites (NR1, NR2) in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, for one year. Kruskal-Wallis ANOVA with post-hoc Mann-Whitney U-tests were used to examine differences in coral recruitment among sites and materials. Coral recruitment was highest at the DDD (4.9 +/- 0.5 recruits 100 cm(-2)), while recruitment was low and did not differ among other sites (PRT: 0.1 +/- 0.04, NR1: 0.3 +/- 0.1, NR2: 0.1 +/- 0.03 recruits 100 cm(-2)). There were significant differences in coral recruitment among materials at DDD, where gabbro had higher recruit densities than concrete and sandstone; sandstone also contained less coral recruits than terra-cotta. Variability associated with low coral recruit densities precluded significant differences among materials at other sites. Overall benthic community structure differed more as a result of differences among sites than among substrate materials. Higher community dissimilarity was observed among sites than among material in SIMPER analysis, and significant differences were only observed among sites in ANOSIM. Univariate comparison of the benthos correlated with community differences in NMS ordination also showed significant differences among sites but not material. Overall, these results indicate that site-specific differences in recruitment patterns are more important in determining early benthic community structure and coral recruitment than are differences among substrate material. However, where coral recruitment is high, these results suggest that gabbro should be used preferentially over concrete or sandstone where it is feasible, but that granite may be a suitable alternative where it is the dominant stone. Coral recruitment on terra-cotta was comparable to all materials but sandstone, supporting its continued use in recruitment studies. These results also indicate that using stone amenable to coral recruitment is unlikely to influence the wider benthic community. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

However, when the first requirements on collision energy from supply vessels were introduced by DNV around 1980, the frequency of impacts by attendant vessels were high - of the order of 10(-3) per installation year. Therefore, it was assumed in the initial requirements that the impact action associated with attendant vessels should, as a minimum, be calculated for the maximum authorized vessel assumed to service the installation. At that time the resulting minimum impact energies were 11 and 14 MJ for head on and side impact, respectively; and have remained the same since then. However, the supply vessel size has since increased and design of supply ship bow and platform has changed. Further, the use of DP controlled supply vessels has increased, which may imply larger velocities at impact. Moreover, the consequence of ship impacts might change e.g. due to the change in design of supply vessels by providing ice-strengthened bows in supply vessels and platforms with cantilevered decks. In the revision of the NORSOK N-003 standard on Actions and action effects the requirements to ship impacts are being reassessed and updated based on statistics on supply vessel sizes and collision energies; as well on service experiences. Besides revisiting the requirements to attendant vessels, other ship impact scenarios are also considered. This especially includes the collision risk associated with shuttle tanker - FPSO. This paper presents the background for the revised standard; in terms of ship impact actions relating especially to supply vessels and shuttle tankers, recognising that the main risk control relating to ship impact is to limit the probability of impacts by operational control. Moreover, the consequences in terms of damage for different types of platforms are addressed, by e.g. demonstrating the feasibility of satisfying more restrictive requirements and especially the effect of providing ice-strengthened bows in supply vessels and designing platforms with cantilevered decks.

The study also describes solutions and measures that may be applicable at different locations in the Barents Sea, and available standards and guidelines related to winterization. Issues related to sea ice, bergy bits and icebergs have not been addressed.As a part of the study, winterization standards and manuals for drilling rigs and production platforms were reviewed, along with available experience from previous and ongoing projects. The information was systematized, and a high level summary produced. The results showed that the main issues related to low temperatures, snow and icing for rigs and platforms operating in the Barents Sea can be simplified and summarized as follow: 1) Snow and icing on exposed surfaces. 2) Freezing of fluids in piping/equipment/tanks. 3) Personnel exposure to low temperatures and weather. These issues were further categorized to include typical areas and equipment types. Several solutions and measures were identified for each of them. The study showed that most of the identified solutions and measures are applicable for most locations in the area open for petroleum activities. However, more permanent and robust solutions should be selected for the coldest areas, as icing rates increases, and wind chill temperature decreases with lower temperatures.The review of winterization manuals also showed the importance of implementing organizational and operational measures related to winterization. Education and training in proper use of winter technology, and defensive behaviour with respect to falling ice and slippery surfaces were identified as some of the most important measures to avoid incidents. Checklists for inspections, before and during the winter season, are important measures to secure areas and equipment when temperatures fall towards freezing point.The study results show a large variety in available solutions and measures for each issue. These shall, combined with organizational and operational measures, ensure safe operations in the Barents Sea. The study shows that the challenge is not whether solutions and measures exist, but in finding the right combination of them for different conditions at specific locations.",,,,,"36th ASME International Conference on Ocean, Offshore and Arctic Engineering36th ASME International Conference on Ocean, Offshore and Arctic Engineering","JUN 25-30, 2017JUN 25-30, 2017","ASME, Ocean Offshore & Arctic Engn DivASME, Ocean Offshore & Arctic Engn Div","Trondheim, NORWAYTrondheim, NORWAY",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,978-0-7918-5776-2,,,,,,,,,"Aker Solut, Tromso, NorwayPetr Safety Author, Stavanger, NorwaySINTEF, Trondheim, Norway",Aker SolutPetr Safety Author,,,2017-12-27,WOS:000417226000030,,

We set up the artificial reefs near a breakwater in Esashi, southwestern coast of Hokkaido, where juveniles of sea cucumber were almost unobserved. Po examine effective size of the reef, we prepared four types of the artificial reefs on the basis of size, and released 1-year old juveniles into them. The censuses were conducted ten times from June 2008 to July 2011 by SCUBA diving. The juveniles grew in average from 16 mm to 77 mm in standard body length during three years of the survey, and the growth rate became lower inversely depending on size of the artificial reefs. The number of juveniles decreased by about 36% after a month from the release and remained until 16 months after that. It then declined to 17% over the next 18 months. The juveniles in the larger artificial reefs showed better survival rates but lower growth rates comparing with those in the smaller ones. Considering increase in the number of the larger sea cucumber around the breakwater alter 3 years of the release, it seems more likely that grown-up juveniles moved from the artificial reefs toward an offshore natural habitat and they might keep about 30% survival rate during the 3 years. These results suggest that the release with artificial reefs makes a certain level of effect to increase the sea cucumber stocks.",,,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,,,1346-1842,,,,,,,,,,,"Hokkaido Univ, Lab Marine Biol, Sapporo, Hokkaido, Japan",,,,2016-03-18,ZOOREC:ZOOR15403012577,,

We compared the fishes associated with 12 co-located reefs constructed of limestone quarry boulders, concrete-gravel aggregate, or concrete-tire aggregate (four of each substrate) in 7 m of water, 200 m offshore Miami Beach, Florida, USA. All 12 reefs were deployed 100 rn apart the same day in two lines of six. The four quarry stone reefs consist of a pile of 50 boulders each. The remaining eight reefs, of concrete-gravel aggregate and concrete-tire aggregate, were each constructed with 25 1.5 m edge and 25 1.2 m edge tetrahedron modules. Every two months from October 1998 to February 2001, SCUBA divers recorded fish species, abundance, and length, as well as spiny lobster, Panulirus argus, abundance. One hundred and forty-six species of fishes were recorded during the study period. The abundance and species richness of fish on each treatment exhibited a significant (p<0.05) seasonal variation with summer months having the greatest numbers and winter the lowest. There was no significant difference in total fish or spiny lobster abundance or fish biomass amongst the three reef types (p>0.05). Likewise, multi-dimensional scaling of Bray-Curtis dissimilarity indices did not indicate clustering of fish assemblages by reef type. Comparison of pre-deployment fish counts from the reef sites and neighboring hard bottom and jetty with counts from the same sites two years post-deployment indicate the artificial reefs increased both fish abundance and richness in the local area.

This research investigates the effects of the configuration of a tidal turbine array, specifically the turbine spacing and capacity, on the hydro-environmental impacts of the array. The hydrodynamic regime of the Shannon Estuary, a highly energetic estuary on the west coast of Ireland, was simulated using a depth integrated 2D hydro-environmental model. The numerical model was modified to incorporate the mechanics of energy extraction using linear momentum actuator disc theory and the impacts of a multiple device array were simulated. Three different array configurations were examined with turbine spacings of 0.5, 2 and 5 rotor diameters. The model results demonstrate that flows are attenuated inside the array and accelerated around the array. Water levels are also affected with a reduction in tidal range within, and upstream of, the array and a delay in high and low tides upstream of the array. The magnitude and extent of the observed impacts are found to reduce as the density and capacity are increased and that the impacts of large-scale arrays can be acceptable if deployed using a low density spacing of 5 rotor diameters.

Species composition and algal biomass on the Bboolsamgak-typed seaweed artificial reefs before and after rocky cleaning were measured and compared before and after rocky cleaning. Before rocky cleaning in July 2012, only nine algal species had existed on the Bboolsamgak-typed seaweed artificial reefs, however,twenty algal species occurred on the seaweed artificial reefs after rocky cleaning in July 2013. Particularly,15 species among them in July 2013 were not found in July 2012 and they seemed to occur newly on the artificial reefs. A large quantity of algal biomass increased in July 2013 after rocky cleaning. Based on the importance value, there was a drastic change in the dominant species between July 2012 and July 2013 after rocky cleaning. By dissecting micrographs, an epiphytic diatom, Licmophora sp. and flagellates,were observed on the 9th day. A chlorophyte, Ulothrix flacca was observed after 14 days, Ulva pertusa,Bryopsis pulmosa, crustose coralline algae, and Cladophora spp. were after one month. After two months,a significant species succession was observed from three previous chlorophyte species to crustose coralline algae existed as a dominant species on the panels. In this study, however, any brown algae were not found until three months in the early seaweed succession.

As low-quality diets may hinder growth, reduce condition, and lead to poor reproductive output, information on diets for various habitat types occupied by Red Snapper is critical. This study utilized both stomach content analysis and nitrogen (delta N-15) and carbon (delta C-13) stable isotope analysis of muscle tissue. Fishes dominated Red Snapper diets at all sites, in all seasons, and generally for all size-classes. A high biomass of zooplankton was consumed at the artificial reef area and during spring. The largest natural reef provided the widest diversity of prey items, and there was little overlap in prey species consumed between natural and artificial reef habitats. Higher delta N-15 and lower delta C-13 values were found for Red Snapper at the artificial reef area, and contrary to the diet results, distinct isotopic niches were found between natural reefs. Differences in Red Snapper isotopic niches between natural reefs indicate that individuals may remain in residence on a specific reef for an extended period. Red Snapper at natural reefs were found to feed on and above the reef, whereas feeding at artificial reefs predominantly occurred on the surrounding seafloor and up in the water column. The quality of habitats underlying reefs is important, as Red Snapper diets reflected the substrate at the occupied reefs. In the northwestern Gulf of Mexico, large, complex natural reefs may provide higher habitat quality for Red Snapper with respect to prey resources than artificial reefs located on mud substrates. Determining which habitats provide high-quality prey resources for Red Snapper in the Gulf of Mexico may assist decisions on policies and regulations for habitat protection as well as decisions on the future placement of artificial reefs.",,,,,,,,,14,0,0,0,14,0,17,,,1942-5120,,,,,,,,,,,"Louisiana State Univ, Dept Oceanog & Coastal Sci, 1002-Y Energy Coast & Environm Bldg, Baton Rouge, LA 70803 USAOregon State Univ, Dept Fisheries & Wildlife, 104 Nash Hall, Corvallis, OR 97331 USAAclima Inc, 10 Lombard St,Suite 200, San Francisco, CA 94111 USA",Aclima Inc,,,2018-12-28,WOS:000417037900002,,

Artificial reefs are used worldwide to increase seabed complexity in an attempt to increase fish and invertebrate densities and biomass. We employed small-scale tetrahedral reefs to test three hypotheses: (1) that increased habitat complexity increases the density of individual demersal and epibenthic fish and crab species; (2) that association of affected species will be stronger during the day than at night; and (3) that the density of affected species will attenuate with distance from reefs. We deployed reefs with transects in Newman Sound, Newfoundland, Canada. Each reef transect was paired with a control transect and additional distant control transects along the 15-m isobath. We estimated the densities of prevalent fish and crab species by means of scuba diving during the autumn of 1999 and summer of 2000. We observed a total of 722 fish and 362 crabs during this study.

Such challenges include the large size and extensive placement of turbines that may represent potential hazards to birds and bats. However, the associated infrastructure required to support an array of turbines-such as roads and transmission lines-represents an even larger potential threat to wildlife than the turbines themselves because such infrastructure can result in extensive habitat fragmentation and can provide avenues for invasion by exotic species. There are numerous conceptual research opportunities that pertain to issues such as identifying the best and worst placement of sites for turbines that will minimize impacts on birds and bats. Unfortunately, to date very little research of this type has appeared in the peer-reviewed scientific literature; much of it exists in the form of unpublished reports and other forms of gray literature. In this paper, we summarize what is known about the potential impacts of wind farms on wildlife and identify a 3-part hierarchical approach to use the scientific method to assess these impacts. The Lower Gulf Coast (LGC) of Texas, USA, is a region currently identified as having a potentially negative impact on migratory birds and bats, with respect to wind farm development. This area is also a region of vast importance to wildlife from the standpoint of native diversity, nature tourism, and opportunities for recreational hunting. We thus use some of the emergent issues related to wind farm development in the LGC-such as siting turbines on cropland sites as opposed to on native rangelands-to illustrate the kinds of challenges and opportunities that wildlife managers must face as we balance our demand for sustainable energy with the need to conserve and sustain bird migration routes and corridors, native vertebrates, and the habitats that support them.",,,,,,,,,252,0,0,0,188,2,305,,,0022-541X,,,,,,,,,,,"Texas A&M Univ, Caesar Kleberg Wildlife Res Inst, Kingsville, TX 78363 USATexas A&M Univ, Dept Wildlife & Fisheries Sci, College Stn, TX 77843 USATexas Parks & Wildlife Dept, Austin, TX 78744 USA",Texas Parks & Wildlife Dept,,,2007-11-01,WOS:000250853000003,,

Recreational sea angling is an important sector within the UK but the experiences and opinions of UK sea anglers with respect to OWFs have not been documented. To address this, an online survey was undertaken with recreational anglers around the UK (n=199). Respondents represented a range of sodo-demographic and angling characteristibs, although male, more frequent and older fishers as well as club members were over-represented compared to a 2012 national survey. One quarter of the respondents had fished around the perimeter of or within an OWF, most on multiple occasions, and 73% of those who had not expressed a willingness to do so in future. Anglers reported both positive and negative effects on catch success when fishing near or within OWFs compared to their experiences of the same site prior to OWF development. Outcomes for individual species were also mixed. Anglers recognised the potential artificial reef effects of OWFs and their role as a safe haven, particularly due to the exclusion of commercial fishers. Negative perceptions included restricted access, harm to marine wildlife, and visual impact. There is little evidence that OWFs will have a significant economic impact on recreational fishing, as most anglers are unlikely to change their behaviour in response to future developments.",,,,,,,,,27,1,0,0,6,0,30,,,0308-597X,1872-9460,,,,,,,,,,"Plymouth Marine Lab, Prospect Pl, Plymouth PL1 3DH, Devon, England",,,,2017-04-01,WOS:000397351500007,,

The control method of the FB-MMC in a series-connected-based offshore wind farm is different from those of traditional ones. The dc current control and capacitor voltage balance control are proposed in this paper, with which the FB-MMC can operate normally in the series-connected offshore wind farm. Moreover, the capacitor ripple voltage in the generator-side FB-MMC is studied.

Accordingly, the wind resource process can be described by the following cascade activities: the coarse spatial wind fields from global meteorological experiments; the regional winds from a dynamic downscaling coupled to the global reanalysis fields; the validation and calibration procedures by using instrumental observations; and, finally, the characterization of winds for evaluation of the wind resource.

The usefulness of ARs is related to their capability of providing ecosystem services/additional functions. We present two distinct Portuguese AR case studies: (1) The Nazare reef off the central coast of Portugal and (2) the Oura reef off the Algarve coast. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with local fishermen in the fishing towns of Nazare and Quarteira pre-and post-AR deployment. The main focus of the interviews was to understand fishermen's perception of AR usefulness (or lack thereof) in terms of nine ecosystem services/additional functions potentially provided by the ARs. We tested the null hypothesis that ARs do not provide additional ecosystem services/additional functions. When queried pre-AR deployment, fishermen indicated that ARs are most likely to provide three ecosystem services: habitat and refuge, biodiversity preservation and food production. Fishermen had similar perceptions post-deployment. For the Nazare reef, fishermen tended to have a positive or neutral perception of ecosystem services/additional functions being provided by ARs. For the Oura reef, fishermen tended to have a mostly neutral perception of AR ecosystem services; however, there were also some positive and other negative perceptions. It was difficult for stakeholders to conceptualize some of the ecosystem services/additional functions provided by ARs prior to actively using them. As a result, some stakeholders changed their perception of the ecosystem services/additional functions after using the structures. These results indicate that stakeholders likely need to perceive ARs as useful in order for them to provide their support for AR installation. Likewise, their support is often needed to justify the use of public funds to install ARs, therefore making it imperative for resource managers to undertake similar interviews with fishermen when considering the use of ARs in other areas.",,,,,,,,,11,0,0,0,3,0,12,,,2167-8359,,,,,,,,,,,"IP, IPMA Portuguese Inst Ocean & Atmosphere, Lisbon, PortugalInst Politecn Leiria, MARE Marine & Environm Sci Ctr, ESTM, Peniche, PortugalUniv Algarve, CinTurs CIEO Res Ctr Spatial & Org Dynam, Faro, PortugalIP, IPMA Portuguese Inst Ocean & Atmosphere, Olhao, PortugalUniv Brest, Ifremer, CNRS, UMR 6308,AMURE,IUEM, Plouzane, FranceFood & Agr Org United Nat FAO, Fisheries Policy Econ & Inst Branch, Fisheries & Aquaculture Policy & Resources Div, Rome, ItalyICCAT, Madrid, Spain",ICCAT,,,2019-01-25,WOS:000455528100002,30647998,

During these cruises, sea turtles were opportunistically observed during the surveys, and critical in situ data such as spatiotemporal information, species identification, habitat use, behavior, and environmental data were collected and evaluated.

Several sea turtle species were spotted within the WFS, including loggerhead Caretta caretta, Kemp's ridley Lepidochelys kempii, and green turtles Chelonia mydas. These opportunistic sightings revealed an area of high use on the WFS, an anthropogenic structure known as the Gulf-stream natural gas pipeline (GSPL).

However, the comparison between the behavior of wild fish inhabiting either natural or artificial habitats has received less attention. Thus the spatio-temporal patterns of fish that establish their home range in one habitat or the other and their consequences of intra-population differentiation on life-history remain largely unexplored. We hypothesize that individuals with a preferred habitat (i.e. natural vs. artificial) can behave differently in terms of habitat use, with important consequences on population dynamics (e. g. life-history, mortality, and reproductive success). Therefore, using biotelemetry, 98 white seabream (Diplodus sargus) inhabiting either artificial or natural habitats were tagged and their behavior was monitored for up to eight months. Most white seabreams were highly resident either on natural or artificial reefs, with a preference for the shallow artificial reef subsets. Connectivity between artificial and natural reefs was limited for resident individuals due to great inter-habitat distances. The temporal behavioral patterns of white seabreams differed between artificial and natural reefs. Artificial-reef resident fish had a predominantly nocturnal diel pattern, whereas natural-reef resident fish showed a diurnal diel pattern. Differences in diel behavioral patterns of white seabream inhabiting artificial and natural reefs could be the expression of realized individual specialization resulting from differences in habitat configuration and resource availability between these two habitats. Artificial reefs have the potential to modify not only seascape connectivity but also the individual behavioral patterns of fishes. Future management plans of coastal areas and fisheries resources, including artificial reef implementation, should therefore consider the potential effect of habitat modification on fish behavior, which could have key implications on fish dynamics.",,,,,,,,,37,1,0,0,35,0,43,,,1932-6203,,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Perpignan, Ctr Format & Rech Environn Mediterraneens, F-66025 Perpignan, FranceCNRS, Ctr Format & Rech Environn Mediterraneens, Perpignan, FranceInst Mediterraneo Estudios Avanzados, IMEDEA CSIC UIB, Esporles, Illes Balears, Spain",,,,2013-09-18,WOS:000323114200033,23935978,

We investigate if the artificial lowering of multiple environmental stressors can be used to give transplanted juveniles the opportunity to form a self-sustainable system and thereby increase their long-term survival on wave-exposed and eroding shores. We designed a large field experiment using juvenile mussels (Mytilus edulis) as model species on a wave-exposed tidal flat in the Oosterschelde estuary (the Netherlands). We tested if the environmental stress caused by a high predation pressure and wave-driven dislodgement could be reduced by a combination of artificial structures such as fences (to exclude predatory crabs), attachment substrates (such as coir-net or oyster shells), and breakwaters. Despite a low overall mussel survival (29%), we found that under strong hydrodynamic conditions, experimental fences and attachment substrates increased the retention of transplanted mussel seed. However, modification of local hydrodynamic conditions using breakwaters did not improve mussel coverage preservation.

These provide vital ecosystem services in addition to economic and amenity value. Alterations to our coastlines associated with rising sea levels will have major implications for humans, wildlife and habitats. We need to predict how our coastline will evolve with climatic change and understand what the environmental and ecological consequences of change to our coasts will be. Much effort is devoted to modelling and predicting changes to inundation or erosion of sedimentary shores, which are already increasing in steepness and decreasing in area ('coastal squeeze') in response to rising sea levels, increasing prevalence of artificial structures and rising and stormier seas. In contrast, virtually no attention has been given to hard rocky coasts that, where the back of the shore is steep, will also show coastal squeeze with rising sea levels. Rock platforms backed by cliffs constitute about 80% of oceanic coastlines globally and in Britain, 42% of the coastline is hard rock, with many areas having cliffs behind the shore. Some of these have shallowly sloping rock above the intertidal zone before the cliff starts, but many others have cliffs close to high water. Predicted increases in relative sea level by 2100 range between 0.30 and 1.90 m. Thus, topographic changes to hard shorelines are unlikely to be trivial, even over this timescale. To understand some potential changes to our coastlines, we estimated present-day extents and slopes of the intertidal zone on hard rocky shores from existing topographical data. Slopes of intertidal area were calculated at fine spatial resolution using a digital elevation model. Actual intertidal extent was calculated from slope, size and numbers of cells in a raster image between high and low tide levels. Tidal levels were then elevated according to two predictions of sea-level rise, allowing calculation of future areas and slopes of the shore. With a rise in sea level of 0.30 m, intertidal extents of three areas of rocky shore in Scotland, each 10s of kms long, will decrease by 10-27%, mean slopes will increase by 0-3 degrees and areas of sloping shoreline >= 45 degrees will increase minimally. With greater rises (1.90 m), areas will decrease by 26-50%, slopes will increase by 1-3 degrees and areas of sloping shoreline >= 45 degrees will at least double in extent. Changes in the physical characteristics of shorelines can influence availability of habitats, with possible impacts on abundance, composition and diversity of assemblages and on behaviour of intertidal organisms. Using examples from the literature about how important intertidal organisms respond to physical conditions, we describe a variety of possible consequences for intertidal ecology.

Recent efforts to mitigate the effects of the Deepwater Horkon oil spill have increased the number of artificial reefs deployed off Florida's Gulf Coast. Fisheries-dependent data are needed to assess whether artificial reef programs are meeting intended objectives and to understand changes in recreational angler behavior, which may influence catch per unit effort and biomass of landed fish. The objective of this study was to quantify the use of artificial reefs by recreational anglers targeting reef fishes in the Gulf of Mexico off the west coast of Florida. We utilized an existing survey designed to monitor recreational fishing effort by anglers that target reef fishes from private boats. Over a 20-month period, an estimated total of 776,026 (SD +/- 27,540) angler trips targeted reef fishes off the Gulf Coast of Florida, of which 46% utilized artificial reefs. Approximately two-thirds of all reef angling trips took place nearshore in state-managed waters, and 70% of trips that utilized artificial reefs occurred in this area. Regionally, the highest proportion of angler trips targeting reef-associated species on artificial reefs took place in the panhandle of Florida, where Red Snapper Lutjanus campechanus are most abundant. Seasonally, state and federal fishing regulations also had an apparent influence on fishing effort and artificial reef use by recreational anglers. The method of assessment we present here could be useful for monitoring future trends in recreational fishing effort with respect to artificial reefs.",,,,,Symposium on Marine Artificial Reef Research and Development: Integrating Fisheries Management ObjectivesSymposium on Marine Artificial Reef Research and Development: Integrating Fisheries Management Objectives,"AUG 22-23, 2017AUG 22-23, 2017",,"Tampa, FLTampa, FL",4,0,0,0,3,0,4,,,0892-2284,,978-1-934874-51-6,,,,,,,,,"Florida Fish & Wildlife Conservat Commiss, Fish & Wildlife Res Inst, 100 Eighth Ave SE, St Petersburg, FL 33701 USAFlorida Fish & Wildlife Conservat Commiss, Div Marine Fisheries Management, 620 South Meridian St,Box 4B2, Tallahassee, FL 32399 USA",,,,2019-02-13,WOS:000456750700016,,

This has many consequences for coastal environments, in particular the trend for artificial structures, such as seawalls, to replace natural habitats. Seawalls and natural shores support many of the common intertidal species, but others important on rocky shores are absent from or rare on many seawalls. The whelk Morula marginalba Blainville is an abundant and important predator on rocky shores of south-eastern Australia, but is infrequently recorded on artificial substrata. In Sydney Harbour, where the Sydney rock oyster (Saccostrea glomerata Gould) was locally abundant, densities of M. marginalba on some seawalls appeared to be similar to those on rocky shores and to be larger than where there were few oysters. We sampled densities and sizes of whelks in four habitats, predicting and corroborating that: (i) on seawalls with many oysters, there would be more whelks than on seawalls with few oysters; (ii) where there are many oysters, densities of whelks would be similar on seawalls and rocky shores; and (iii) whelks would be larger where oysters were abundant. Growth and survival of whelks were measured to test hypotheses from the observed differences in size and density. Survival was greater in habitats with many oysters, which could explain differences in density, but size-specific differences in survival could not explain differences in size among habitats. On seawalls but not on rocky shores, slower growth could explain the smaller size of whelks where there were few oysters. Seawalls provide important habitat for M. marginalba, but only via their indirect effects, mediated by oysters. These interactions cannot be predicted from those on natural rocky shores. Predicting how developed areas provide suitable habitat, either in management of conservation or in assessments of potential impacts clearly depends on understanding the roles of biogenic habitats.",,,,,,,,,42,0,0,0,39,0,44,,,1442-9985,1442-9993,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Sydney, Ctr Res Ecol Impacts Coastal Cities, Marine Ecol Labs, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia",,,,2008-05-01,WOS:000254926300008,,

The deployment of most artificial reefs involves configurations based on engineers' judgments, and the spatial and financial constraints of the system. These designs are often merely plausible and not necessarily optimal. The DARCs model tries to integrate ecological and engineering aspects to replace subjective deployment. The core of this model is based on the ecological concept that species diversity and biomass will increase where habitat system complexity is higher. Here, we apply the fractal dimension to assess the habitat system complexity. We present a solving algorithm for achieving the maximal fractal dimension under a fixed budget. Moreover, we apply the proposed model to a case stud), by considering the dispersal dynamics for a specific conservation policy.

This results in a range of environmental impacts which should be taken into account in a benefit-cost analysis of such proposals. In this paper, we use choice modeling to investigate the relative gains and losses from siting new windfarms off the coast of Estonia, relative to the option of creating a new marine protected area. We find that, while respondents are generally opposed to converting marine shoals to conventional wind farms and prefer the establishment of marine protected areas instead, benefits from constructing 'environmentally-friendly' wind farms - an alternative program which is also considered by the government - are not statistically different with respect to consumers' welfare to those associated with creating a new marine protected area. Methodologically, the paper makes a contribution by showing the ability of the latent class mixed logit model to represent both within - and between-class preference heterogeneity, and thus its power to provide a more sophisticated representation of preference heterogeneity than stand-alone latent class or mixed logit approaches. The paper also presents the first use of the latent class mixed logit model in willingness-to-pay space for environmental goods. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

While their fish aggregating effects are well known, the epibenthic assemblages have been poorly investigated. Two types of artificial reefs (pyramids of concrete slabs and bundles of concrete tubes) have been deployed out of the Po River Delta in 2006 and 2010. The epibenthic assemblages were investigated in 2009 and 2012. Benthic assemblages on both structure typologies were dominated by species tolerating high sedimentation rates. Dissimilarities were found among assemblages with different ages, and, in less extend, between reef typologies. Colonisation by Mytilus galloprovincialis and other major space occupiers did not follow a clear succession pattern and was not affected by reef typology. Species colonisation was likely driven by variability in environmental conditions and recruitment processes rather than by reef typology. This study suggests that environmental features of the deployment sites should be carefully considered in planning and designing artificial reefs, especially in eutrophic and turbid coastal waters, exposed to high river loads.

Fish assemblages on six small (1 m(2)) concrete block reefs were censused biweekly for 12 mo; three of the six reefs were denuded at 3-mo intervals. Assemblages on these small reefs were less predictable than those on the large artificial and natural reefs. Predictability of fish assemblages on large and small reefs generally increased with number of species present, but was not consistently related to total number of individuals present. Values of assemblage similarity varied from agreement with Australian studies, which generally espouse recruitment-limited non-equilibrial assemblage structure, to agreement with other Caribbean studies, which generally espouse stable, resource-limited assemblage structure.

The consequences of fracture are significant. It may imply a significant reduction in structural capacity. It may also pose a potential hazard for human safety, as well as lead to an environmental and economical loss, e.g. caused by tanker collision or grounding.A series of five steel-plate indentation tests were conducted at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU), Department of Mariner Technology, during late fall 2007. These are performed quasi-statically on various configurations of stiffened panels. The tests represent hull or deck plates in ships or platform structures subjected to accidental actions from ship-ship collisions, ship grounding or dropped object impacts. Various configurations of stiffened panels are tested, all laterally by a cone shaped indenter until fracture occurred. The specimen dimensions represent a 1:3 scale of the dimensions found in medium sized tankers, i.e. plate thickness of 5 mm. Naturally, because damaged hull and cargo tanks may cause severe environmental consequences, focus is on the plastic deformation and fracture resistance of the panels.The panel tests are primarily intended to serve as verification for advanced finite element simulations using a failure criterion based on instability mechanisms, i.e. local necking. This is implemented into the non linear explicit finite element code LS-DYNA and is referred to as the BWH instability criterion. In addition, the influence of the element size with respect to onset of failure is studied using three different element sizes for the various test cases.Although, attention is primarily placed on accidental scenarios, such as ship collision and grounding, the experimental results are of considerable relevance for other types of abnormal actions, e.g. dropped objects on deck and subsea structures, and stiffened panels subjected to explosion or ice actions.",,,,,"29th ASME International Conference on Ocean, Offshore and Arctic Engineering29th ASME International Conference on Ocean, Offshore and Arctic Engineering","JUN 06-11, 2010JUN 06-11, 2010","ASME, Ocean, Offshore, & Arctic Engn DivASME, Ocean, Offshore, & Arctic Engn Div","Shanghai, PEOPLES R CHINAShanghai, PEOPLES R CHINA",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,978-0-7918-4910-1,,,,,,,,,"Reinertsen AS, Trondheim, Norway",Reinertsen AS,,,2010-01-01,WOS:000290548700065,,

These decision makers face logistical and financial constraints in determining which type of structure (e.g., size, material) to deploy, as well as the added complication that ecological evaluations of structure performance are sparse. As a result, deployed artificial habitats often fail to meet habitat restoration or supplementation goals, especially in marine systems. Here, we evaluated the ecological performance of four types of marine artificial reefs (metal ships, three types of concrete modules) relative to each other and to neighboring natural habitat (rocky reefs). Through diver-conducted fish surveys on twenty-three reefs offshore of North Carolina (NC), USA, we found that different reef types hosted distinct fish communities. Concrete modules performed similarly to rocky reefs, supporting similar fish abundance, biomass, and community composition. In contrast, metal ships supported different fish communities than concrete modules and rocky reefs. Further analyses revealed that these patterns may relate to the 'footprint' and structural complexity of reef structures. These findings suggest that managers should strategically deploy particular types of artificial reefs depending on their objectives. For example, concrete modules should be deployed if the objective is to mimic rocky reefs, whereas deploying ships may create habitats that surpass natural reefs in fish abundance and biomass but with different communities. Moving forward, managers and conservation practitioners must rely on the most recent and location-specific structure evaluations when deciding which types of artificial habitats to deploy given their management objectives.",,,,,,,,,39,0,0,0,24,0,40,,,0006-3207,1873-2917,,,,,,,,,,"Yale Univ, Yale Sch Forestry & Environm Studies, 195 Prospect St, New Haven, CT 06511 USAUniv North Carolina Chapel Hill, Inst Marine Sci, 3431 Arendell St, Morehead City, NC 28557 USAUniv N Carolina, Dept Biol, 120 South Rd, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USAFlorida State Univ, Dept Geog, 113 Collegiate Loop, Tallahassee, FL 32306 USANOAA, Natl Ctr Coastal Ocean Sci, Natl Ocean Serv, 101 Pivers Isl Rd, Beaufort, NC 28516 USACSS Inc, 10301 Democracy Lane,Suite 300, Fairfax, VA 22030 USAOregon State Univ, Dept Fisheries & Wildlife, 104 Nash Hall, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA",,,,2019-12-06,WOS:000497252700015,,

Radar techniques are especially useful for investigating species which fly at high altitudes, in darkness, or which are too small for applying electronic tags. Here, we present an overview of radar applications in biological conservation and highlight its future possibilities. Depending on the type of radar, information can be gathered on local- to continental-scale movements of airborne organisms and their behaviour. Such data can quantify flyway usage, biomass and nutrient transport (bioflow), population sizes, dynamics and distributions, times and dimensions of movements, areas and times of mass emergence and swarming, habitat use and activity ranges. Radar also captures behavioural responses to anthropogenic disturbances, artificial light and man-made structures. Weather surveillance and other long-range radar networks allow spatially broad overviews of important stopover areas, songbird mass roosts and emergences from bat caves. Mobile radars, including repurposed marine radars and commercially dedicated 'bird radars', offer the ability to track and monitor the local movements of individuals or groups of flying animals. Harmonic radar techniques have been used for tracking short-range movements of insects and other small animals of conservation interest. However, a major challenge in aeroecology is determining the taxonomic identity of the targets, which often requires ancillary data obtained from other methods. Radar data have become a global source of information on ecosystem structure, composition, services and function and will play an increasing role in the monitoring and conservation of flying animals and threatened habitats worldwide.",,,,,,,,,22,0,0,0,17,0,24,,,0906-7590,1600-0587,,,,,,,,,,"Inst Avian Res Vogelwarte Helgoland, Wilhelmshaven, GermanyUniv Agr, Dept Forest Biodivers, Krakow, PolandUS Geol Survey, Northern Rocky Mt Sci Ctr, Bozeman, MT USAUniv Greenwich, Nat Resources Inst, Chatham, Kent, EnglandRothamsted Res, Harpenden, Herts, EnglandUniv Oklahoma, Corix Plains Inst, Norman, OK 73019 USAUniv Bern, Inst Ecol & Evolut, Bern, SwitzerlandUniv Western Australia, Sch Biol Sci, Crawley, Australia",Inst Avian Res Vogelwarte Helgoland,,,2019-05-20,WOS:000466819000007,,

We used a combination of non-metric multidimensional scaling and indicator value analysis to identify the indicator species of the specific AR environments. More individuals and species of fish were present in ARs compared to Conts. Water temperature over the seasons was the most important environmental factor associated with the trophic group composition of fish. In particular, macrocamivores and benthic invertivores/cleaners closely reflected habitat conditions in a consistent manner. Some dominant fish species were detected at all sites, while the indicator species were more predominant under certain environmental conditions.

After the hurricanes, fishers and divers could not relocate many artificial reefs in the area. Extensive visual censuses of artificial reef assemblages had been conducted in the impacted areas in 1991-1993. This database provided the opportunity to examine the effects of hurricanes on artificial reefs, and the interaction effects of hurricanes and fishing pressure on the associated fish assemblages. Post-hurricane positions of 38 reefs in a permitted reef site, 14 km offshore, were determined by sonar and identified visually by divers. Materials of higher density were least affected by wave surge; however, a large steel vessel was broken into several pieces. Lighter (low-density) materials were moved distances of at least 1000 m. Comparisons of pre- and post-hurricane fish assemblages revealed a significant increase in average length of gag (Mycteroperca microlepis) and red snapper (Lutjanus canapechanus). Because some reefs were displaced, fishing pressure was greatly reduced for at least 1 year. The new coordinates for a number of the relocated reefs were released to the public, thereby subjecting the fish assemblages to increased fishing pressure. Pre- and post-fishing comparisons indicated significant differences in biomass, number of gray triggerfish (Balistes capriscus), average length of gag, and number and average length of red snapper. These results, coupled with published information, indicate that artificial reefs may serve as refugia from fishery harvest following severe storms. This refugia function has potential utility in the design of marine reserves as well as offering an alternative strategy in the development of fishery management plans.

The objectives of the survey were to 1) identify knowledge and attitudes about artificial reefs by constituency groups in the Southeast region of the U.S., 2) determine the relative importance of artificial reef conflicts and assess strategies to minimize these and 3) develop recommendations and inform artificial reef managers about acceptable management strategies. Implications for management are presented including the need to have sportdivers share in reef building expenditures, the support for imposition of an artificial reef stamp, recommendations for improvement of informational programs, the acknowledgement of a lack of widespread support for FADs by the user community and the overwhelming acceptance of various management restrictions to preserve the resource and reduce conflict.",,,,,,,,,19,0,0,0,12,0,19,,,0007-4977,,,,,,,,,,,"US FOREST SERV,SE FOREST EXPT STN,ATHENS,GA 30602",,,,1994-09-01,WOS:A1994QB58400057,,

The report first describes impacts from offshore windfarms on marine mammals and defines the spatial and temporal scope of investigations in order to detect impacts on marine mammals. Impacts from offshore windfarming occur at very different spatial and temporal scales: Construction work, especially pile driving, may result in short-termed but long ranged impacts, whereas the operation of windfarms is expected to result in local but long-lasting impacts. The report reviews the standard methods used in studies on marine mammals in relation to offshore windfarms. Statistical power of line transect surveys using aircrafts and ships and Static Acoustic Monitoring using T-PODs is analysed from datasets obtained in German studies. Aerial surveys provide an efficient method for multi-species surveys covering rather large areas (2000 km2 ) per survey, which are considered to be sufficient to compare impact and reference areas. In areas where abundance of harbour porpoises are sufficiently high, which is expected to be the case in many UK waters, aerial surveys are useful to measure population size and population changes. Based on datasets in areas of high densities, it is concluded that 30 % changes can be detected by 1-3 surveys. Aerial surveys will provide additional data on other species, however, as either densities (dolphins, whales) or detection rates (seals) are low, no quantitative data can be obtained in restricted areas. Aerial surveys are often restricted by weather conditions and thus suffer from a low temporal resolution. The spatial resolution may not be sufficient to detect small-scaled impacts as expected during the operation of offshore windfarms. Line transect counts from ships may also be used for marine mammal surveys. They have a lower spatial resolution and are even more restricted to suitable weather conditions. Based on datasets in areas of high densities, it is concluded that 30 % changes can also be detected by 1-3 surveys. The efficiency of ship transect surveys can probably be highly improved by towed hydrophones, which record echolocation clicks from porpoises and dolphins. The main advantage of towed hydrophones would be, that it can be used at night and during weather conditions, which do not allow visual surveys. Static Acoustic Monitoring (SAM) using T-PODs or other devices provide excellent data on harbour porpoises and potentially also dolphin species at a high temporal but low spatial resolution. The spatial resolution can be improved by deploying several SAM devices in the area of interest. Statistical analysis from areas with low and high porpoise densities proved that a 30 % change in harbour porpoise presence can be proved with a sample size of 3-11. Other methods, as telemetry tracking, photo-identification and haul-out counts for seals are described. For impact studies in relation to offshore windfarms a BACI (Before-After/Control-Impact) design is generally recommended but recommendations are also given for cases, where no baseline data are available or a BACI may not be possible for other reasons. It is recommended to combine line transect surveys using aircrafts or ships with Static Acoustic Monitoring. An impact study on offshore windfarms should ideally cover two years before construction, the construction period and at least two years of operation. If longer lasting effects are detected, the study during the operational phase should be extended. It is recommended to conduct line transect surveys in monthly intervals. In areas with a marked seasonal occurrence, surveys may be restricted to periods with high abundance, when sufficient data are more likely to be obtained. Continuous recordings of harbour porpoises with SAM are recommended for all areas, where these animals occur in relevant numbers. SAM will provide data which are needed to detect short-termed changes in behaviour and abundance as expected in response to pile driving, but also to detect changes on a much smaller spatial scale as can be detected by other methods as well as long-term changes in response to construction of operation. For seals and dolphins severe problems in assessing the impacts remain, as their behaviour or low densities make it very difficult to obtain enough data for statistical analysis.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,978-0-9557501-2-0,,,,,,,,,"Bioconsult SH, Brinckmannstr. 31, 25813, Husum, Germany",,,,2008-01-01,ZOOREC:ZOOR14503017856,,

Ecological theory suggests two main possible answers for this paradox: competitive superiority of exotic species over native species and opportunistic use of ecological opportunities derived from human activities. We tested these hypotheses in birds combining field observations and experiments along gradients of urbanization in New South Wales (Australia). Five exotic species attained densities in the study area comparable to those of the most abundant native species, and hence provided a case for the invasion paradox. The success of these alien birds was not primarily associated with a competitive superiority over native species: the most successful invaders were smaller and less aggressive than their main native competitors, and were generally excluded from artificially created food patches where competition was high. More importantly, exotic birds were primarily restricted to urban environments, where the diversity and abundance of native species were low. This finding agrees with previous studies and indicates that exotic and native species rarely interact in nature. Observations and experiments in the field revealed that the few native species that exploit the most urbanized environments tended to be opportunistic foragers, adaptations that should facilitate survival in places where disturbances by humans are frequent and natural vegetation has been replaced by man-made structures. Successful invaders also shared these features, suggesting that their success is not a paradox but can be explained by their capacity to exploit ecological opportunities that most native species rarely use.",,,,,,,,,90,1,0,0,93,1,103,,,0029-8549,1432-1939,,,,,,,,,,"Autonomous Univ Barcelona, Ctr Ecol Res & Forestry Applicat CREAF, Bellaterra 08193, Catalonia, SpainCSIC, Ctr Adv Studies Blanes CEAB, Blanes 17300, Catalonia, SpainUniv Newcastle, Sch Psychol, Callaghan, NSW 2308, Australia",,,,2012-06-01,WOS:000304166600025,22139450,

Initially, R&D only focused on simple designs and construction using discarded tires, wooden fishing boats, polyvinyl chloride (PVC) pipe, reinforced concrete, and ceramic sewerage pipe. These reefs were used in fisheries management to maximize resource enhancement, resource conservation, and habitat rehabilitation and mitigation, as well as being an aid to alleviate the problem of depleting fish resources in coastal waters. However, in 2006, the DoFM made a major policy change in the design and construction materials of artificial reefs in the country. The focus was to construct large, heavy, and robust artificial reefs using durable materials such as reinforced concrete and steel to deter the encroachment of destructive fishing gears, especially trawlers, along the coastal and in marine protected areas. These new artificial reefs addressed several issues, such as fish behavior, target species, physical oceanography, and marine engineering, in their design. The reinforced concrete artificial reefs were built according to the British Standard 8110 under the supervision of officers from the Engineering Division and Research Division of the DoFM. Presently, the DoFM has designed 21 types of artificial reefs that have been deployed at 130 selected locations in Malaysia.

The decision, taken in 1998, was made despite a paucity of evidence to identify the environmental impact redundant rigs create, despite the absence of scientific support to demonstrate that removal is the best practicable environmental option and in the knowledge that the decision had more to do with a green anti-oil agenda than with improving marine quality. It may be shown in the fullness of time not to be in the best interests of the environment.

In order to observe the effects of an operating wind farm on fish, we studied the rather stationary and benthic-living fish species viviparous eelpout(Zoarces viviparous) as model indicator organisms. We compared local populations of viviparous eelpout in the Lillgrund Offshore Wind Farm (OWF) with natural sites in the Oresund strait in Sweden. Eelpout studies on population dynamics, biometrics, reproductive success and fry development were conducted in 2011 and 2012. Condition index, histosomatic index, gonadosomatic index were measured additionally. Our findings showed that Lillgrund OWF neither had an impact on the condition index (CI), nor on brood development of female viviparous eelpout. Furthermore, populations size estimates in Lillgrund indicated that eelpout neither specifically aggregated in nor avoided the offshore wind farm, and no clear reef effect attracting eelpout to the foundations and scour protections of the OWF was observed. Our conclusion is that the operating wind farm did not have any potentially negative effects, since we did not observe any negative effects neither on the individual health of eelpout nor of the reproductive performance. We suggest that eelpout which may also be used as an indicator species for the environmental status of Lillgrund, as well as for other offshore wind farms and marine renewable energy installations, both in the Baltic and coastal waters in northern Europe.",,,,,,,,,7,2,0,0,4,0,9,,,1470-160X,1872-7034,,,,,,,,,,"Chalmers Univ Technol, Dept Energy & Environm, Gothenburg, SwedenNorwegian Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Biol, Ctr Biodivers Dynam, Trondheim, NorwayGothenburg Univ, Dept Marine Sci, Gothenburg, SwedenUni Res, Bergen, Norway",Uni Res,,,2018-03-13,WOS:000425828200001,,

Using baited remote underwater video (BRUV) fish assemblages on purpose-built estuarine artificial reefs and adjacent natural rocky-reef and sand-flat were assessed 18 months post-deployment in three south-east Australian estuaries. Fish abundance, species richness and diversity were found to be greater on the artificial reefs than on either naturally occurring reef or sand-flat in all estuaries. Comparisons within each estuary identified significant differences in the species composition between the artificial and natural rocky-reefs. The artificial reef assemblage was dominated by sparid species including Acanthopagrus australis and Rhabdosargus sarba. The preference for a range of habitats by theses sparid species is evident by their detection on sand-flat, natural rocky reef and artificial reef habitats. The fish assemblage identified on the artificial reefs remained distinct from the adjacent rocky-reef, comprising a range of species drawn from naturally occurring rocky-reef and sand-flat. In addition, some mid-water schooling species including Trachurus novaezelandiae and Pseudocaranx georgianus were only identified on the artificial reef community; presumably as result of the reef's isolated location in open-water. We concluded that estuarine artificial reef assemblages are likely to differ significantly from adjacent rocky-reef, potentially as a result of physical factors such as reef isolation, coupled with species specific behavioural traits such as the ability of some species to traverse large sand flats in order to locate reef structure, and feeding preferences. Artificial reefs should not be viewed as direct surrogates for natural reef. The assemblages are likely to remain distinct from naturally occurring habitat comprised of species that reside on a range of adjacent natural habitats.",,,,,,,,,58,2,0,0,53,0,64,,,1932-6203,,,,,,,,,,,"NSW Dept Primary Ind, Recreat & Indigenous Fishing Div, Coffs Harbour Jetty, NSW, AustraliaPort Stephens Fisheries Inst, NSW Dept Primary Ind, Wild Fisheries Res Div, Nelson Bay, NSW, AustraliaUniv New S Wales, Sch Biol Earth & Environm Sci, Sydney, NSW, Australia",,,,2013-06-03,WOS:000319872300011,23755106,

The forage community parameters (number of individuals, taxonomic richness, biomass, and diversity) were compared from areas which had no reefs to areas around reefs. Our analysis indicates there was considerable variation in the infauna in all areas. The number of individuals was lower near the reefs but was at the background level about 80 m from the reefs. Number of taxa was lower next to the reef and increased slightly away from the reefs but was much lower than background species richness. Species diversity was higher in the area near the reefs.

Drawing on qualitative research conducted in Tomakomai and Japan more widely across the project development and implementation phase, the paper argues that building an understanding of the social, cultural and historical relationship between the community, industry and the sea is crucial to understanding the neutral or cautiously supportive response of the citizens and stakeholders in Tomakomai to the project. Moreover, effective SIA in coastal regions needs to find a way to account for or at least make visible these complex relations between society and the sea. Based on the findings, it is suggested that developers or policymakers overseeing SIA in coastal regions ought to pay extra attention to the extent to which developments like CCS are viewed by communities as 'new' as opposed to a continuation of existing activities in the sea; to the importance of engagement on monitoring during the project operations phase; and to the non-economic values such as pride and identity which communities and stakeholders may derive from the sea.",,,,,,,,,25,1,0,0,5,0,27,,,0308-597X,1872-9460,,,,,,,,,,"Robert Gordon Univ, Sch Appl Social Studies, Aberdeen AB10 7QG, ScotlandMarine Ecol Res Inst, Appl Biol Grp, 4-7-17 Arahama, Kashiwazaki, Niigata 9450322, JapanRes Inst Innovat Technol Earth, Storage Res Grp CO2, 9-2 Kizugawadai, Kyoto 6190292, Japan",Marine Ecol Res Inst,,,2017-09-01,WOS:000407410200030,,

Visual censuses were carried out at monthly intervals during 3 years (19921995). Comparison of the fish assemblages 2 years after deployment indicated differences associated with reef and control habitats. D. annularis, D. vulgaris, Chromis chromis, and Apogon imberbis were the species most responsible for assemblage differences.

A growing number of studies have applied nonmarket valuation methods like Choice Experiments (CE) to value the visual impact by eliciting respondents' willingness to pay (WTP) or willingness to accept (WTA) for hypothetical wind farms through survey questions. Several meta-analyses have been found in the literature to synthesize results from different valuation studies, but they have various limitations related to the use of the prevailing multivariate meta-regression analysis. In this paper, we propose a new meta-analysis method to establish general functions for the relationships between the estimated WTP orWTA and three wind farm attributes, namely the distance to residential/coastal areas, the number of turbines and turbine height. This method involves establishing WTA or WTP functions for individual studies, fitting the average derivative functions and deriving the general integral functions of WTP or WTA against wind farm attributes. Results indicate that respondents in different studies consistently showed increasing WTP for moving wind farms to greater distances, which can be fitted by non-linear (natural logarithm) functions. However, divergent preferences for the number of turbines and turbine height were found in different studies. We argue that the new analysis method proposed in this paper is an alternative to the mainstream multivariate meta-regression analysis for synthesizing CE studies and the general integral functions of WTP or WTA against wind farm attributes are useful for future spatial modelling and benefit transfer studies. We also suggest that future multivariate meta-analyses should include non-linear components in the regression functions. (C) 2018 The Authors.

There is increasing interest in mitigating this biodiversity loss by adding topographic habitat to these structures, and/or seeding them with habitat-forming species. Settlement tile experiments, comparing colonisation of species to more and less complex habitats, have been used to inform eco-engineering interventions prior to their large-scale implementation. Most studies have focused on applying one type of intervention (either adding habitat structure or seeding with native organisms), so it is unclear whether there are greater benefits to biodiversity when multiple interventions are combined. Using a fully orthogonal experiment, we assessed the independent and interactive effects of habitat structure (flat vs. crevice/ridges) and seeding with native oysters (unseeded vs. seeded) on the biodiversity of four different functional groups (sessile and mobile taxa, cryptobenthic and pelagic fishes). Concrete tiles (flat unseeded, flat seeded, complex unseeded and complex seeded) were deployed at two sites in Sydney Harbour and monitored over 12 months, for the survival and colonisation of oysters and the species density and abundances of the four functional groups. The survival of seeded oysters was greater on the complex than flat tiles, at one of the two sites, due to the protective role of crevices. Despite this, after 12 months, the species density of sessile invertebrates and the percentage cover of seeded and colonising oysters did not differ between complex and seeded tiles each of which supported more of these variables than the flat unseeded tiles. In contrast, the species density of mobile invertebrates and cryptobenthic fishes and the MaxN of pelagic fishes, at 1 month, were only positively influenced by seeding with oysters, which provided food as well as habitat. Within the complex seeded and unseeded tiles, there was a greater species density of sessile taxa, survival and percentage cover of oysters in the crevices, which were more humid and darker at month 12, had lower high temperature extremes at months 1 and 12, than on the ridges or flat tiles. Our results suggest that eco-engineering projects which seek to maximise the biodiversity of multiple functional groups on seawalls, should apply a variety of different microhabitats and habitat-forming species, to alter the environmental conditions available to organisms.",,,,,,,,,23,0,0,0,20,0,25,,,1932-6203,,,,,,,,,,,"Sydney Inst Marine Sci, Mosman, NSW, AustraliaUniv New South Wales, Sch Biol Earth & Environm Sci, Ctr Marine Sci & Innovat, Sydney, NSW, AustraliaMacquarie Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Macquarie Pk, NSW, AustraliaUniv Sydney, Sch Life & Environm Sci, Ctr Res Ecol Impacts Coastal Cities, Sydney, NSW, AustraliaUniv Tasmania, Inst Antarctic & Marine Sci, Hobart, Tas, AustraliaUniv Melbourne, Sch Biosci, Natl Ctr Coasts & Climate, Melbourne, Vic, Australia",,,,2020-07-16,WOS:000553976700027,32673342,

In this study, we quantified the level of microplastic pollution at an offshore wind farm in the Yellow Sea, China, in 2016. The abundance of microplastics was 0.330 +/- 0.278 items/m(3) in the surface water and 2.58 +/- 1.14 items/g (dry) in the sediment. To the best of our knowledge, the level of microplastic pollution in our study area was slightly higher than that in coastal areas around the world. The microplastics detected in the surface waters and sediments were mainly fibrous (75.3% and 68.7%, respectively) and consisted of some granules and films. The microplastics in the samples might originate from garments or ropes via wastewater discharge. The abundance of plastic in the water and sediment samples collected from the wind farm area was lower than that in the samples collected from outside the wind farm area. The anthropogenic hydrodynamic effect was the main factor affecting the local distribution of microplastics. The presence of a wind farm could increase the bed shear stress during ebb tide, disturbing the bed sediment, facilitating its initiation and transport, and ultimately increasing the ease of washing away the microplastics adhered to the sediment. This study will serve as a reference for further studies of the distribution and migration of microplastics in coastal zones subjected to similar marine utilization.",,,,,,,,,73,12,0,0,64,0,83,,,0025-326X,1879-3363,,,,,,,,,,"Nanjing Univ, Sch Geog & Oceanog Sci, Nanjing 210023, Jiangsu, Peoples R ChinaNanjing Univ, Minist Educ, Key Lab Coastal & Isl Dev, Nanjing 210023, Jiangsu, Peoples R ChinaNanjing Univ, Sch Earth Sci & Engn, Nanjing 210023, Jiangsu, Peoples R ChinaMarine Fisheries Res Inst Jiangsu Prov, Nantong 226007, Peoples R China",Marine Fisheries Res Inst Jiangsu Prov,,,2018-12-28,WOS:000430645600054,29571398,

For instance, the larval supply and cues that influence colonization (physical), as well as the growth and mortality of individuals (biotoic), may differ across location and reef type. Determining the relative influence of these processes is important to understanding how epibenthic communities can develop in a region. Using both a partial caging experiment that controlled grazing by urchins and in situ photographic surveys of epibenthic communities, this study examined the relationship between urchin grazing and the composition of epibenthos on natural limestone and artificial reefs in the eastern Gulf of Mexico (eGOM). In the experiment, tiles that were open to urchin grazing had lower percent cover of algae ( - 12%) and higher cover of crustose coralline algae (CCA) (13%) than those that excluded urchins. Patterns in tile cover were likely the result of CCA either resisting grazing mortality or recolonizing exposed areas after algae were removed. Variation in colonization was observed between inshore and offshore reef groups. Urchin density was positively correlated with the structural complexity of the habitats, which was higher on artificial reefs than natural ones, a factor that potentially had important effects on several observed patterns. Results from photographic surveys indicated that natural reef communities had higher algal cover and lower cover of invertebrates (e.g., corals and hydroids) than artificial reefs. These findings were consistent with previous work conducted in both temperate and tropical ecosystems, and suggested that grazing from urchins plays an important role in shaping epibenthic community structure in the subtropical eGOM.",,,,,,,,,4,0,0,0,4,0,5,,,0022-0981,1879-1697,,,,,,,,,,"Univ S Florida, Coll Marine Sci, 140 7th Ave, St Petersburg, FL 33705 USA",,,,2018-12-28,WOS:000449132600007,,

To examine the validity of this concept, a long-term comparison of the developing AR fouling communities to those of nearby NRs is required. A survey of the fouling reefal organisms was conducted on seven shipwrecks (Red Sea, Egypt), comprising three young (ca 20 years old) and four old (4100 years old) unplanned ARs, in comparison to nearby NR communities. The hypothesis tested was that the age of the ARs shapes the structure of their fouling coral communities. The results demonstrated distinct differences between ARs and NRs and between young and old ARs. While the species composition on ARs may resemble that of NRs after approximately 20 years, obtaining a similar extent of coral cover may require a full century.

Artificial reefs can not only provide shelter for fishery resources but also improve aquatic environment, which helps to protect and enhance fishery resource stocks. Considering the above functions of artificial reefs, it is very necessary to study the attractive effects and mechanisms of artificial reefs. However, due to differences in water depth, ocean current, substratum and other sea environment factors, different types of artificial reefs are needed in different regions. It is a major evaluation tool to assess the effects of artificial reefs by simulation experiments in laboratory. To observe the attractive effects of three artificial reef models for Sparus macrocephlus, the behavior and distribution of S. macrocephlus was observed through experiments in laboratory. The results showed that the distribution of S. macrocephlus scattered randomly when the artificial reef models did not exist, and all the artificial reef models showed attractive effects on S. macrocephlus when they were put in the test region. The M1 artificial reef models, which had the maximal effective space and screening effects among three artificial reef models, showed the best attraction to S. macrocephlus. In addition, the attractive effects of M2 and M3 on S. macrocephlus were decreased due to their smaller effective space and screening effects. However, numerical analysis results showed no significant difference among three artificial reef models (P>0.05). The results suggested that the attractive effects of three artificial reef models for S. macrocephlus were determined by both different structures of artificial reef models and habits of S. macrocephlus.

This project, consisting of two parts, was carried out in the Canadian province of Quebec, on the coasts of the St. Lawrence Estuary and Gulf, which cover the territory of 21 coastal Regional County Municipalities (RCM). The objectives were to characterise shoreline armoring in Eastern Quebec, to determine the role played by coastal managers, coastal citizens, and coastal engineers in the coastal defence decision-making process, and to identify possible actions to be taken by each stakeholder to improve coastal engineering development. First, over 3300 km of shoreline were segmented and characterised, allowing the mapping of what proportion of the shoreline was covered by artificial structures. In 2017, coastal defence measures (CDM) occupied about 10% of the shoreline, and 97.6% of them were reflective rigid structures. The second part of the project involved three different consultations carried out in 2017 and 2018 with 300 coastal managers, 494 coastal residents and 51 professionals from environmental and engineering firms to assess their knowledge of CDM types and functions, and to discuss about the decision process leading to the CDM identification. Results of the consultations show a significant change in the type of desired solutions compared to previous studies where rigid structures were clearly preferred. But despite a greater prioritization of soft techniques by professionals from municipalities, ministries' managers and coastal citizens, the rigid structures continue to be the type of solution mostly implemented along Quebec's coasts. This difference can be explained by a number of factors: a lack of specialized knowledge; a lack of funding; a lack of collaborative process; and regulations that are too restrictive for innovative CDM. In addition to an increase of funding for preventive CDM, for long term CDM monitoring and maintenance, for case studies and pilot projects, the main solutions proposed were interdisciplinary projects based on consultation, adjustment of environmental regulations, and development of a tool that would enable decision-makers to evaluate each option in a particular context, so as to identify the most appropriate solutions and make better decisions for the long term.",,,,,,,,,6,0,0,0,0,0,6,,,0964-5691,1873-524X,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Quebec Rimouski, Chaire Rech Geosci Cotiere, 300 Allee Ursulines, Rimouski, PQ G5L 3A1, CanadaUniv Quebec Rimouski, Quebec Ocean, 300 Allee Ursulines, Rimouski, PQ G5L 3A1, CanadaUniv Quebec Rimouski, Ctr Etud Nord CEN, 300 Allee Ursulines, Rimouski, PQ G5L 3A1, CanadaEcole Technol Super, Lab STEPPE ETS, 1100 Rue Notre Dame Ouest,Local A-1500, Montreal, PQ H3C 1K3, Canada",,,,2021-01-06,WOS:000594738300001,,

Static gear fisheries targeting sedentary benthic species are particularly affected by spatial management that involves exclusion of fishers. Here we investigate the ecological effect of a short-term closure of a European lobster (Homarus gammarus(L.)) fishing ground, facilitated by the development of the Westermost Rough OWF located on the north-east coast of the United Kingdom. We also investigate the effects on the population when the site is reopened on completion of the construction. We find that temporary closure offers some respite for adult animals and leads to increases in abundance and size of the target species in that area.

Proposals for one common form of renewable energy, commercial wind farms, are frequently met with forceful local opposition. Dissatisfied with simplistic explanations for this opposition (i.e., NIMBY), social scientists have urged a more nuanced understanding of public attitudes towards wind energy and other renewables. Based on a survey of residents of coastal Michigan, this article explores the foie of general values and beliefs in shaping attitudes towards the potential development of commercial wind energy projects in or near respondents' communities. Structural equation modeling reveals that support of commercial wind energy depends largely on a belief that wind farms will provide economic benefits to the community. Underlying values have substantial and important indirect effects on beliefs regarding the likely economic outcomes of wind farm development. Altruistic values buoy wind energy attitudes, while values of traditionalism diminish wind energy support. The pivotal role of values in attitudes towards renewables lends support for more participatory development processes. (c) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

The average positive response rate to all questions was above 50%, implying a desire by tourists for environmentally friendly accommodation and renewable energy supply. Tourists indicated that they perceived RES to be reliable and expressed a willingness to cooperate with RES initiatives and possible resultant inconveniences. However, there were mixed opinions with regard to consumer willingness to pay for the product. Of the 49% of respondents who were willing to pay extra for RES, 92% replied they would pay between 11% and 5%. Analysis of the variation in response due to accommodation type revealed a 'city' hotel versus 'eco-resort' difference. Likewise, a breakdown of responses according to country of origin indicated that Australians had a more positive attitude to RES than overseas visitors, including Japanese and Americans. While no variation in response was detected according to gender, age had a measurable bearing on response, with older guests returning a higher positive response rate. Visual queue questions querying aesthetic opinions and 'not-in-my-backyard' (NIMBY) attitude to RES revealed that there was virtually no opposition to photovoltaics. Opinions regarding wind energy conversion systems (WECS) varied with type and location, with rooftop WECS receiving more acceptance than stand-alone varieties. A high level of visual acceptance was shown by respondents for onshore wind farms located close to a tourist accommodation centre, with less enthusiasm for offshore farms. A strong NIMBY attitude to WECS was not observed among Australian or local respondents. (c) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Degraded coral reefs may not respond readily to restoration efforts due to our incomplete understanding of various ecological dynamics such as loss of source sites, decline in species richness, shifts in species dominance, trophic interactions, and bioinvasion. Coral reef restoration techniques are at an experimental stage. There are two major approaches to reef restoration: coral transplantation and artificial reefs. Coral transplantation is appealing because it is an efficient means of turning a bare reef into a highly covered reef and there is a scientific basis for the technique. By contrast, artificial reef implementation is widely used and apparently accepted by the public and some resource managers, yet its scientific foundation is far from complete. Even so, there are major potential benefits of artificial reefs, which make them an essential tool in reef restoration. I suggest that the focus on artificial reefs and coral transplantation be shifted to combined approaches that use aspects of both in conjunction with other methods such as re-introduction of algal grazers.

IMTA holds scope for multi-use of offshore areas and can bring environmental benefits from making use of waste products and transforming these into valuable co-products. Furthermore, they may act as alternative marine production systems and provide scope for alternative income options for coastal communities, e.g., by acting as nodes for farm operation and maintenance requirements. This paper summarizes the current state of knowledge on the implications of the exposed nature of offshore and open ocean sites on the biological, technological and socio-economic performance of IMTA.

Six-hundred and twenty nine recaptures were reported, representing 578 tagged red snapper. Sixty-five percent of recaptures (n = 412) were made at the site of release on subsequent research cruises, while 217 recaptures were reported by fishers. Eighty-six percent of individuals with known recapture locations moved 2 km or less from the site of release; mean and maximum distances moved were 2.1 km and 201 km, respectively. Nine red snapper moved greater than 80 km. Mean dispersion rate from release sites was 8.6 m d(-1). Annual site fidelity of tagged fish was estimated using nonlinear decay models. Estimated annual site fidelity ranged from 48% to 52% year(-1) and was not significantly affected by artificial reef design, reef fish biomass at the site of release, or artificial reef densities surrounding each tagging site. Growth rates were estimated by regressing the change in red snapper total length versus the days a fish was at liberty. Mean growth rate for all recaptured fish was 0.206 mm d(-1). Growth rates were significantly affected by reef size (faster at larger experimental reefs) and reef fish biomass (slower at tagging sites supporting low reef fish biomass), but were not affected by artificial reef density. Moderate site fidelity and low dispersion rates during our study provide support for the hypothesis that artificial reefs off Alabama are suitable habitat for adult red snapper. However, characteristics of artificial reefs, such as reef size and standing stock biomass, may affect red snapper growth. Furthermore, ratios of instantaneous growth in weight to total mortality (G/Z) suggest artificial reefs off Alabama serve as net sinks (i.e., G/Z < 1) of red snapper biomass under current fishing mortality rates.",,,,,Symposium on Fisheries Ecology of Gulf of Mexico Red SnapperSymposium on Fisheries Ecology of Gulf of Mexico Red Snapper,"FEB 10-12, 2006FEB 10-12, 2006","Sea Grant Louisiana; NOAA; Univ West Florida; Univ S Alabama; Louisiana State Univ, Coastal Fisheries InstSea Grant Louisiana; NOAA; Univ West Florida; Univ S Alabama; Louisiana State Univ, Coastal Fisheries Inst","San Antonio, TXSan Antonio, TX",31,0,0,0,29,0,50,,,0892-2284,,978-1-888569-97-1,,,,,,,,,"NOAA, Fisheries Serv, Southeast Reg Off, 263 13th Ave S, St Petersburg, FL 33701 USALouisiana State Univ, Coastal Fisheries Inst, Baton Rouge, LA 70803 USALouisiana State Univ, Sch Coast & Environm, Dept Oceanog & Coastal Sci, Baton Rouge, LA 70803 USAUniv West Florida, Dept Biol, Pensacola, FL 32514 USA",,,,2007-01-01,WOS:000253386500010,,

Service platforms, as well as the pylons themselves, offer perfect structures for mooring longlines and other culture units. One of the advantages of offshore culture may be a lower parasite load in offshore mussels compared with mussels produced under traditional inshore bottom culture. By sampling mussel spat from off. shore suspended buoys or collectors, we simulated an offshore culture situation and compared parasite infestation rates with those in mussel spat obtained from suspended inshore buoys or collectors, in mussels from inshore benthic subtidal beds and from inshore benthic intertidal mussel beds. Mussels from offshore sites were free of trematodes and shellboring polychaetes. Parasitic copepods only occurred at a single offshore site, on a 20-year-old research platform, but not on buoys or collectors exposed for shorter time periods. All three monitored parasite taxa were present at all other sites. The highest prevalence was found for trematodes in inshore benthic intertidal mussels (78.7 +/- 6.4%) and locally reached 100%. Through a variety of detrimental effects, trematodes, parasitic copepods and shell-boring polychaetes are known to affect growth performance and product quality. We therefore propose that offshore mussel production could be a promising culture procedure because it seems to result in lower parasite burden than at traditional culture sites. Whether offshore production also results in better survival and growth, compared with inshore mussel culture on a commercial scale, needs to be investigated further.",,,,,,,,,43,0,0,0,37,1,45,,,0175-8659,1439-0426,,,,,,,,,,"Alfred Wegener Inst Polar & Marine Res, Wadden Sea Stn Sylt, D-25992 List Auf Sylt, GermanyAlfred Wegener Inst Polar & Marine Res, D-2850 Bremerhaven, GermanyTerramare Res Ctr, Wilhelmshaven, GermanyBioconsult SH, Hockensbull, GermanyInst Marine Res, Kiel, Germany",Terramare Res CtrBioconsult SHInst Marine Res,,,2005-04-01,WOS:000227968500005,,

Two- to three-fold differences in reef fish demographic measures were observed within replicate experimental reef designs. To determine which factors, specifically related to location (i.e., proximity of other reefs, size and density of surrounding reefs, etc.), contribute to the observed variability in reef fish demographic measures, a side-scan sonar was used to quantify the abundance, distribution, and bottom area or footprints (m(2)) of natural reefs and previously deployed artificial reefs within 1 km(2) of each experimental reef. Stepwise regression was used to assess the amount of variability in reef fish demographics accounted for by side-scan sonar variables, reef design, season, and year. 36%-53% of the variability in reef fish demographics was explained. Reef fish biomass was negatively correlated with artificial reef abundance and there was a negative correlation between red snapper mean total length and the total bottom area of artificial reefs surrounding experimental reefs.

In order to serve as foundations for various offshore structures, suction caissons are pushed into the seabed under pressure differential exerted on their lid by an imposed suction. Despite their wide use in the oil and gas industry, there are still some uncertainties regarding their installation process as a result of changes in seabed profiles such as the existence of low permeability layers as well as the variation in soil properties with depth (e.g. permeability decreasing with depth due to an increase in soil density). It is known that seepage conditions play a pivotal role in the installation process, particularly in sand. Indeed, pressure gradients generated by the imposed suction inside the caisson cavity cause an overall reduction in the soil resistance around the caisson wall and at caisson tip, thereby assisting the penetration into the seabed. Successful installation of caisson foundations relies on accurate prediction of soil conditions, in particular soil shear resistance during the installation. Existing knowledge of the prediction of soil conditions and required suction during caisson installation has some limitations which often resulted into rather conservative design methods. Most design procedures used to control suction during caisson installation assume an isotropic and homogenous seabed profile. Moreover, the actual variation of pressure gradient around the caisson wall at different penetration depths is often ignored, although it significantly affects soil resistance. Natural seabed can possess a heterogeneous property where it may comprise of different layers of soils including the presence of layers with low-permeability i.e. clay or silt. In this paper, the effect of seepage on soil conditions during caisson installation is studied within the frame of the presence of a substratum that consists of silt. Suction induced seepage described throughout the installation process and its effects on frictional and tip resistance are considered. For this purpose, a numerical simulation is conducted on a normalised geometry of the suction caisson and surrounding soil, at different penetration depths. The distribution of pressure gradient on both inside and outside of the caisson wall is taken into consideration in both soil shear and tip resistance. Particular conclusions will be drawn on the implications of the presence of a low permeability silt layer on caisson installation.",,,,,Mini-Symposium on Induced Seismicity / 2nd International Symposium on Energy Geotechnics (SEG)Mini-Symposium on Induced Seismicity / 2nd International Symposium on Energy Geotechnics (SEG),"SEP 25-28, 2018SEP 25-28, 2018","Int Soc Soil Mech & Geotechn Engn, Tech Comm 308 Energy GeotechnInt Soc Soil Mech & Geotechn Engn, Tech Comm 308 Energy Geotechn","Swiss Inst Technol Lausanne, Lausanne, SWITZERLANDSwiss Inst Technol Lausanne, Lausanne, SWITZERLAND",1,0,0,0,0,0,1,,,1866-8755,1866-8763,978-3-319-99670-7; 978-3-319-99669-1,,,,,,,,,"Aston Univ, Sch Engn & Appl Sci, Birmingham, W Midlands, EnglandUniv Medina, Fac Engn, Dept Civil Engn, Medina, Saudi ArabiaUniv Birmingham, Dept Civil Engn, Birmingham, W Midlands, England",Univ Medina,,,2020-08-26,WOS:000558273700062,,

Forty-eight percent of stomachs contained identifiable prey, which we grouped into seven categories: fish, decapods, cephalopods, stomatopods, gastropods, zooplankton, and other invertebrates. Based on these categories, Red Snapper diet was significantly different following the DWH oil spill, and was differentially affected by fish size. The interaction between habitat (natural versus artificial reefs) and DWH oil spill effects was also significant. Significant differences in diet among Red Snapper size-classes were due to low trophic position prey, such as pelagic zooplankton, being more abundant in the diet of larger (>500 mm) Red Snapper, while decapods and fish constituted a higher proportion of the diet of smaller individuals. Red Snapper consumed higher amounts of decapods at artificial (21.9% by mass) versus natural (14.8%) reef sites, but the habitat effect on diet was not significant. The habitat x DWH timing interaction was driven by a decrease in zooplankton consumed at both habitat types, increased benthic prey at natural reefs, and increased fish consumption at artificial reefs in post-DWH oil spill samples. Stable isotope data indicated a postspill increase in Red Snapper trophic position (N-15 enrichment) and an increase in benthic versus pelagic prey (S-34 depletion), both consistent with observed dietary shifts. Overall, results indicate shifts in Red Snapper diet and trophic position occurred following the DWH oil spill, thus the relative abundance of prey resources likely changed.",,,,,,,,,42,0,0,0,37,0,58,,,1942-5120,,,,,,,,,,,"Univ S Alabama, Dept Marine Sci, Dauphin Isl Sea Lab, Dauphin Isl, AL 36528 USA",,,,2015-01-01,WOS:000362351200011,,

We examined assemblage structure of tropical fishes on small, artificial reefs to determine if differences in refuge availability could modify patterns of species richness and abundance of fishes established at recruitment.2. Our artificial reefs were designed to provide prey refuge of two types (permanent and transient), Permanent refugia are those that physically exclude predators, i.e. small holes provide permanent refuge from large-bodied predators. Transient refugia result when habitat complexity increases the probability that prey will elude predators. These refugia do not physically exclude predators and thus provide no permanently safe sites.3. We conducted this experiment at two widely separated locations on Australia's Great Barrier Reef. The species pools of reef fishes, recruitment rates and predator densities all differ between these locations.4. At neither location were patterns of recruitment influenced by the presence of either type of refuge. By the end of the experiment, however, there were more resident fishes on reefs with additional refugia.5. Species richness of residents was positively related to total abundance of residents. Therefore, refuge availability indirectly affected species richness through its effect on abundance. There was no indication, however, that permanent refugia provided any greater protection to prey species than did transient refugia.6. Our results therefore indicate that for these communities, patterns of species richness and abundance established at settlement can be modified considerably over small spatial and temporal scales by differences in refuge availability. Furthermore, habitat complexity need not provide permanently safe sites to affect patterns of coexistence.",,,,,,,,,170,1,0,0,114,5,195,,,0021-8790,1365-2656,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1996-07-01,WOS:A1996UZ02700002,,

The impacts on people's values (and hence welfare) of changes in ecology and amenity that could arise from the installation of a windfarm in the Irish Sea were assessed using a discrete choice experiment administered through an online survey. The ecological changes investigated were: increased species diversity resulting from artificial reef effects, and the effect of electromagnetic fields from subsea cables on marine life; whilst the amenity change was the visibility of offshore turbines from land. Respondents expressed preferences for ecological improvements but had less clear preferences regarding the height and visibility of the turbines. In particular distance decay effects were observed with respondents further away from the coast being less concerned about visual impact created by offshore turbines.

All of these species are protected under the U.S. Migratory Bird Treaty Act and many are listed under the U.S. Endangered Species Act. The protections given by these two Acts and the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) require that any development activities that may impact these species undergo an environmental impact assessment to identify appropriate mitigation strategies. There are multiple hypotheses concerning the causal factors of these declines, including but not limited to: 1) global warming-induced changes in habitat and food availability on the Arctic breeding grounds, 2) decreased stopover habitat due to human development in key coastline habitats, 3) decreased food availability in stopover habitats due to human overexploitation of fisheries and beach renourishment, and most recently, 4) increased mortality due to large-scale energy development projects such as wind turbine generators. It is critical to understand the true relative impacts of these potential causes of avian population declines to best design mitigation strategies and to facilitate recovery of these threatened and endangered populations. We risk inhibiting both the recovery of these avian species and the economic development of local human communities if we do not prioritize mitigation strategies correctly. The cost of this research is minimal compared to the potential lost economic revenue if affected industries cannot demonstrate compliance with federal laws governing mitigation for potential and actual harm to threatened and endangered species. For example, the combined conch and eel fisheries, which rely on horseshoe crabs for bait, bring in an estimated $21 million in revenue annually to the Atlantic Coast region (Manion 2000). Currently, horseshoe crab harvest is restricted or completely prohibited in many mid-Atlantic states, because of assumed benefits to the red knot population. This is dramatically limiting the eel and conch fisheries. This economic restriction must be justified with the scientific studies that are proposed here. Similarly, recent research has demonstrated that offshore wind power generation in the mid-Atlantic region, with present-day technology could provide power for nine states in that region, with allowance for a greater than 50% increase in power usage (Amardeep et al. in press, Bryant 2007). One major issue currently preventing the large-scale installation of offshore wind turbine generators is concern about impact on threatened and endangered bird species. This study will provide preliminary data for future research that will promote environmentally-sound installation of these wind energy projects and ultimately promote greater energy independence of the Commonwealth and nation.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,0216914; 593503,,,,,,,,VIRGINIA POLYTECHNIC INSTITUTE AND STATE UNIVERSITY,,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:13351792,,

In this study, to evaluate if an artificial reef off Sydney was meeting its goal of providing quality fishing opportunities through the establishment of a complex fish assemblage, a 4-year monitoring program was designed. This program examined the response of reef-associated and pelagic fishes to the deployment of a purpose built offshore reef, relative to control reefs. Fish were observed immediately following deployment, but the artificial reef fish assemblage remained distinct from the three natural control reefs throughout the monitoring period. Also, the artificial reef displayed inter-annual variability associated with successional processes, which was not evident on the natural reefs. Fish length data indicated that the artificial reef was providing resources for both juvenile and adults of a number of species. This study demonstrates artificial reefs can provide habitats for a diverse group of fish, but the assemblages are unlikely to mimic those on natural reefs.

Typically they are open ecosystems, with steep environmental gradients. Their accessibility to man has rendered them susceptible to a variety of impacts since prehistoric times. Access can be regulated, however, and they are more amenable to management than open ocean habitats. This review uses examples from throughout the world to demonstrate the extent to which rocky shores have been, and are currently, affected by pollution (examples used are endocrine disrupters, oil, eutrophication), over-collection of living resources, introduced alien species, modification of coastal processes (coastal defences, siltation) and global change (climate, sea level). These impacts are put into the context of natural fluctuations in time and variability in space of both the environment and the organisms. The relative magnitudes of some anthropogenic disturbances differ between the industrialized, developed world and the developing world. For example, in developed, industrialized countries pollution based impacts should diminish over the next 25 years due to improved regulation and a reduction in older 'dirtier' heavy industry. Conversely, in many developing countries pollution will increase as a consequence of growth in the human population and industrialization. Except for large-scale disasters such as oil spills, pollution tends mainly to influence embayed coastlines. Chronic effects such as eutrophication can have broader-scale impacts over whole coastlines and elevated nutrient levels have also been implicated in a trend of increasing frequency of catastrophic kills due to harmful algal. Direct removal of living resources has had major effects on coastlines at both local and regional scales and is likely to increase over the next 25 years, especially in developing countries where rapidly expanding human populations will put further pressure on resources. Impacts from recreational activities are likely to increase with greater leisure time in wealthier regions of the world, and cheaper travel will spread these impacts to poorer regions. Invasions by alien species have increased in frequency during the last 20 years leading to some dramatic effects on native assemblages. Problems associated with alien species, especially pathogens, will continue to increase over the next few decades. The proportion of the coastline modified by artificial structures (breakwaters, seawalls, groynes) will increase because of coastal development and defences against sea-level rise and the greater frequency of storms. This will increase connectivity between areas of rocky habitat. Siltation will continue to increase due to urbanization of catchments and estuaries, and changes in agricultural practice. This may have considerable impacts at local and regional scales, favouring sediment tolerant organisms such as turf algae and anemones. In the future, greater frequency of environmental extremes is likely, including large-scale events such as the El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO). Global change in temperature, sea-level rise and increases in the frequency of storms will affect rocky shores throughout the world, but this will occur over long time scales; over the next 25 years most of the responses by rocky shore communities will mostly be quite subtle. Thus rocky shores will be subject to increasing degradation over the next 25 years. They are, however, less vulnerable than many other aquatic habitats due to their hard substratum (rock), their relative lack of large biogenic structures and to their generally open nature. They are also remarkably resilient, and recTheir susceptibility to both terrestrial and marine disturbances does make them more vulnerable than sublittoral and offshore habitats. There are considerable gaps in knowledge, particularly of certain microhabitats such as crevices, boulders, sand-scoured areas and rock pools. These have been much less studied than more accessible assemblages on open, freely draining rock. More research is needed to establish the effects of increasing sediment loads, ultraviolet radiation and introduced species on rocky shore communities. Strategic and applied research programmes should integrate field experiments and carefully selected monitoring programmes to verify management regimes. Hindcasting from the palaeo-record would be valuable, to compare rates of predicted change with periods when change was rapid in the past. This information could, in principle, be used to help conserve rocky shores through networks of marine protected areas and a general reduction of environmental pollution.",,,,,,,,,340,0,0,0,285,14,386,,,0376-8929,1469-4387,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Southampton, Sch Biol Sci, Div Biodivers & Ecol, Southampton SO16 7PX, Hants, EnglandMarine Biol Assoc United Kingdom Lab, Plymouth PL1 2PB, Devon, EnglandUniv Plymouth, Sch Biol Sci, Plymouth PL4 8AA, Devon, EnglandUniv Coll Dublin, Dept Zool, Dublin 4, Ireland",,,,2002-06-01,WOS:000178121600004,,

Scientifically, they are used increasingly as platforms for rigorous ecological experimentation. Historically, a case has been made that at least some artificial reef technologies have not been grounded upon sound principles, and that their utilization can harm fish populations and the environment. Can artificial reef deployments, and their associated body of technical knowledge, be considered as established practices and components in fishery science? What is the appropriate role and scope for them in marine ecosystem management? While these questions are debated, advances in the science and applications of this technology nevertheless continue. This chapter concludes that this relatively young field does add value to environmental science and management.Our understanding of artificial reefs needs to be informed by theory and empirical evidence, and this paper adopts both approaches. Bioeconomics provides a frame of reference for analyzing the circumstances in which reef deployment will generate sustainable economic benefits, and gives a theoretical context for the examples that follow. Case studies illustrate a sustained -community-based fishery in Portugal, attainment of resource protection and allocation objectives in Italy, success in designing a reef to create habitat for kelp in the United States, and incorporation of reefs into marine ranching in Korea, all at relatively large scales. Together, these findings illustrate shared attributes and trends concerning study and deployment of artificial reefs, which may unify, guide, and foster future investigations and management in various branches of aquatic sciences. For example:Sustainability of resource utilization is a standard concern that sets reefs in a broader social and environmental context.Maintaining or enhancing biodiversity is a common goal that extends reef objectives beyond exploitation.Engaging a broad variety of community stakeholders enhances reef development and assessment efforts.Using artificial reefs as sites for manipulative experiments affords study designs that could not be conducted at natural habitats.Promoting multidisciplinary studies offers a powerful approach for addressing complex environmental issues.Adaptation of fundamental knowledge of species life history requirements to the design of physical structure of reefs combines basic research with the interests of society for applications.",,,,,9th International Conference on Artificial Reefs and Related Aquatic Habitats (CARAH)9th International Conference on Artificial Reefs and Related Aquatic Habitats (CARAH),"NOV 08-13, 2009NOV 08-13, 2009",,"Curitiba, BRAZILCuritiba, BRAZIL",9,0,0,0,8,0,11,,,2154-7769,,978-1-4398-2008-7; 978-1-4398-2007-0,,,,,,,,,"Univ Florida, Fisheries & Aquat Sci, Gainesville, FL 32611 USASouthern Calif Edison, Rosemead, CA USAUniv Portsmouth, Dept Econ, Portsmouth, Hants, EnglandNatl Fisheries & Marine Sci Inst, Olhao, PortugalNatl Council Researchers CNIR, Inst Marine Sci ISMAR, Ancona, ItalyNatl Fisheries Res & Dev Inst, West Sea Fisheries Res Inst, Inchon, South KoreaUniv Genoa, Genoa, ItalyUniv British Columbia, Fisheries Ctr, Vancouver, BC V5Z 1M9, Canada",Southern Calif EdisonNatl Fisheries & Marine Sci InstNatl Fisheries Res & Dev Inst,,,2011-01-01,WOS:000356919700002,,

Using a stated preference survey, this study investigates the present consumer surplus associated with visitor use of a marine protected area in Barbados. Two hypothetical markets were presented to differentiate between respondents use values of either: (a) natural reefs within the. marine reserve or (b) artificial reef habitat for recreational enhancement. Information was also collected on visitors' perceptions of artificial reefs, reef material preferences and reef conservation awareness. From a sample of 250 visitors on snorkel trips, we estimate a mean willingness to pay of US$18.33 (median-US$15) for natural reef use and a mean value of US$17.58 (median-US$12.50) for artificial reef use. The number of marine species viewed, age of respondent, familiarity with the Folkestone Marine Reserve and level of environmental concern were statistically significant in influencing willingness to pay. Regression analyses indicate visitors are willing to pay a significant amount to view marine life, especially turtles. Our results suggest that user fees could provide a considerable source of income to aid reef conservation in Barbados. In addition, the substantial use value reported for artificial reefs indicates a reef substitution policy may be supported by visitors to the Folkestone Marine Reserve.

Reef structures installed in Korea and Japan have been chiefly designed with respect to water depth, target species, and ratio of Void space. Most reefs were developed on the basis of how fish species would respond to them behaviorally, and their placements were oriented accordingly. Also, ratio of void space has been enlarged to minimize the amount of materials required in construction. Japan has developed taller reefs that were designed to attract all fish that respond positively to the presence of a reef. An enlargement in bulk volume, and height, with a limited void-space ratio, characterizes these taller reefs. Korea has developed a concrete reef style, the box reef, which was designed to meet the biological requirements of both Korean rockfish Sebastes schlegeli and madai (also known as red porgy) Pagrus major, which behave differently on reefs. The box reef attracted more Korean rockfish and madai than a natural reef.

Aquatic macroinvertebrates were sampled along with physical and chemical measures of the soil and water from 29 agricultural drainage ditches on the Eastern Shore of Maryland. Cluster analysis and multivariate ordination showed that ditches that had higher flow velocities supported communities of lotic invertebrates (i.e., Stenelmis, Prosimulium) versus those that had properties of linear wetlands, which supported communities of lentic invertebrates (i.e., Oligochaeta, Caecidotea). Taxon richness varied from four to 31 taxa per ditch, and was higher within ditches that had higher flow velocities. Small ditches had low diversity, but may have provided refugia from fish predators. Macroinvertebrate communities did not show a significant linear relationship with water quality or with nutrient concentrations within the soil or water. The addition of flow-control structures designed to improve the quality of water draining from agricultural lands may decrease the quality of ditches as habitat for certain aquatic macroinvertebrates.

High aspect ratio reefs have significantly greater numbers of fishes recruiting to them than do low aspect ratio reefs. A low-cost method of increasing reef aspect ratio is through the use of small, tautline moored, midwater fish aggregation devices. Utilizing this technology we demonstrated that the recruitment of juvenile fishes to the demersal habitat may be focused to specific sites. Once in the demersal habitat, predation may be high so the design and scale of the benthic habitat beneath the midwater fish aggregation devices must be considered. Benthic habitat covering areas much greater than 2 m(2) of substratum probably allows demersal predators to take up residence and impact the new recruits. The use of midwater fish aggregation devices that serve to focus the recruitment may attract and aggregate coastal pelagic species that also may be predators on the new recruits. Thus the technology suggests possibilities for the improvement of recruitment, but the scale and dispersion of the artificial habitat must be given careful consideration. If correctly applied, the technology may be useful in the restoration of coral reef fish resources.",,,,,,,,,13,0,0,0,5,1,15,,,0007-4977,1553-6955,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1994-09-01,WOS:A1994QB58400030,,

Underwater noise, induced by in-water pile driving, could adversely impact marine life near the piling location. Many studies have computed this noise in close ranges by using semi-analytical models and Finite Element Method (FEM) models. This work presents a Spectral Element Method (SEM) wave simulator as an alternative simulation tool to obtain close-range underwater piling noise in complex, fully three-dimensional, axially-asymmetric settings in the time domain for impacting force signals with high-frequency contents (e.g., frequencies greater than 1000 Hz).The presented numerical results show that the flexibility of SEM can accommodate the axially-asymmetric geometry of a model, its heterogeneity, and fluid-solid coupling. We showed that there are multiple Mach Cones of different angles in fluid and sediment caused by the difference in wave speeds in fluid, a pile, and sediment. The angles of Mach Cones in our numerical results match those that are theoretically evaluated. A previous work(18) had shown that Mach Cone waves lead to intense amplitudes of underwater piling noise via a FEM simulation in an axis-symmetric setting. Since it modeled sediment as fluid with a larger wave speed than that of water, we examined if our SEM simulation, using solid sediment-fluid coupling, leads to additional Mach Cones. Because this work computes the shear wave in sediment and the downward-propagating shear wave in a pile, we present six Mach Cones in fluid and sediment induced by downward-propagating P- and S-waves in a pile in lieu of two previously-reported Mach Cones in fluid and sediment (modeled as fluid) induced by a downward- propagating P-wave in a pile. We also showed that the amplitudes of the close-range underwater noise are dependent on the cross-sectional geometry of a pile. In addition, when a pile is surrounded by a solid of an axially-asymmetric geometry, waves are reflected from the surface of the surrounding solid back to the fluid so that constructive and destructive interferences of waves take place in the fluid and affect the amplitude of the underwater piling noise.",,,,,,,,,2,0,0,0,1,0,2,,,2591-7285,2591-7811,,,,,,,,,,"Catholic Univ Amer, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Washington, DC 20064 USACatholic Univ Amer, Dept Mech Engn, Washington, DC 20064 USAPrinceton Univ, Dept Geosci, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA",,,,2020-03-27,WOS:000519726900008,,

Analysis of technical, economic and ecological boundaries indicated that the potential of fish culture is limited, that seaweed cultivation is likely to gain potential when challenges related to processing will be overcome and that mussel culture has the highest potential in the near future. The North Sea is an area where many stakeholders claim space, which might set boundaries to the number of sites available for mussel culture. Competing claims are a potential source of conflict but may also lead to mutual benefits when smart combinations are sought, e.g. with wind parks, fisheries and nature conservation; especially, the possibility of combining mussel culture in or around wind parks is worthwhile to be further explored. A spatial distribution model adapted for the Dutch North Sea conditions demonstrated that offshore mussel production in wind farms can be profitable.

To achieve this, Time Depth Recorder (TDR) and Global Location Sensor (GLS) tags were deployed on individuals from several European locations. Due to an incidental mortality, one set of tags was retrieved early. The single set of tags recorded activity from June to August 2018. The TDR collected records for 14 d, providing the first ever biologging data on RTL foraging in Europe. The bird was tagged 90 km from the coast; therefore, it only used freshwater lakes and was never recorded entering saltwater. The individual mostly undertook shallow dives, with maximum and mean depths of 20 m and 5.4 m, respectively. Foraging constituted 22.9% of total activity during the sampling period. The RTL had diel foraging patterns. with dives being shallower and more frequent at times of twilight compared to daylight.

This is followed usually by microorganisms and more developed forms, but there appears to be no obligatory order in this succession. The influence of the substratum chemistry on the rate and the extent of adhesion of microorganisms is still not fully agreed because many types of organisms in differing physiological states have been used, making consensus difficult. Sometimes the surface chemistry of the substratum was not established, which further clouds the picture. Genetic evidence now supports the idea that surface proximity promotes the induction of new metabolic capabilities in microorganisms, however the environmental signal responsible for this is not agreed. We propose that restricted diffusion at a surface plays a role in the process. Support for the hypothesis that the biofilm matrix polymers are not the adhesives involved in the initial attachment of cells to surfaces is growing. Diatom adhesion is a more complicated process than that for bacteria and requires glycoprotein and protein synthesis as well as metabolic energy, i.e. it is not a passive process. Bacteria can utilize surface-bound substrates and it is possible that diatoms attached to sediment grains can exploit their attached existence also by moving along concentration gradients of dissolved organic substances in adjacent pore waters. Practical interest in the adhesion of marine microorganisms derives from their role in the degradation of man-made structures. A film of organisms only a few microns in thickness causes the hydrodynamic drag on a ship to increase considerably. Investigations of the means by which marine microorganisms adhere to surfaces have been taking place for more that 50 yr, yet we still do not understand completely the mechanisms involved.",,,,,,,,,258,3,0,0,135,2,286,,,0948-3055,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1995-01-01,WOS:A1995RJ74200014,,

While various future pathways to a decarbonised society are possible, analysis by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change makes it clear that limiting global temperature increases to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels requires major structural changes in the supply of energy. Renewable energy production will have to be expanded dramatically if it is to provide the majority of global electricity production by the middle of the century. Offshore wind turbines, the largest rotating machines ever built, have the potential to provide very large volumes of clean electricity. It is cautiously estimated that the realisable United States offshore wind resource is more than twice the current national electricity demand. In some island nations such as the UK, the resource is even more abundant. Exploiting the stronger winds found offshore will involve the creation of substantial new industries involving hundreds of thousands of workers. Often out of sight, offshore wind turbines are also less likely to provoke resistance from neighbouring communities than onshore developments. Consequently, expansion of offshore wind farms is an explicit environmental, industrial and energy policy objective in many maritime countries. But organisational and institutional factors are proving to be serious barriers to policy implementation, slowing, delaying, or preventing expansion in some, but not all, countries. Previous analysis of the UK, a leader in offshore wind, suggests that key to enabling an offshore wind industry that can deliver the desired energy is the active coordination between disparate domains by an 'interested broker' or 'system builder'. These actors strive to create new institutional forms or 'ways of doing things' - activity sometimes referred to as 'institutional entrepreneurship'.Working with carefully selected project partners, who collectively offer £38k of in-kind support, this project will study the creation of offshore wind industries and the role played by institutional entrepreneurship in enabling or constraining their growth. Empirical field-work will be carried out in three major offshore wind markets: the UK, a somewhat unexpected leader given the conflictual nature of renewable energy politics in that country; Denmark, a pioneer in offshore wind with a strong coordinative role in the energy sector for the State; and the United States where a lack of coordination between actors has contributed to stifled growth to-date.The research will add to academic understanding of organisations and public policy, specifically how motivated actors are able to shape their environment through coordinative institutional entrepreneurship. Such understanding will have value to scholars researching energy systems in the context of large-scale change towards sustainability.The knowledge created in the course of the project will also be useful to policymakers seeking more effective offshore wind policies that overcome some of the organisational and institutional challenges currently slowing deployment or driving up costs, benefiting consumers and the environment. It will also provide businesses, civil society groups and others with a clearer understanding of how offshore wind industries emerge, and their potential role in shaping them.The skills development programme will provide training in all aspects of research management including finance, project planning and execution, networking and impact. The project is also designed to develop the applicant's quantitative research skills through externally provided training, drawing on the capacity of Exeter's Q-Step quantitative data-analysis programme as well as the ESRC-funded National Centre for Research Methods. To aid the building of international collaboration networks, a one month invited visiting researcher post has also been planned.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,ES/T000600/1,,,,,,,,University of Exeter,,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:15307408,,

The estuary consists of a number of deltaic islands, generally densely populated, and exposed to extreme meteorological and hydrological conditions like recurrent tropical cyclones and high flood flows etc. those have devastating effects in the area. The area is also characterised by high level of hydrodynamic activities. Erosion and accretion occur simultaneously at very high rates; such that, the flow and sediment discharge through the estuary are the third highest and the highest, respectively, in the world. Although lands are accreted as some of this huge volume of sediment is deposited in the estuary, severe erosion along the riverbanks and in the islands threatened physical safety and social security of inhabitants and of infrastructure. A development plan has been proposed under Meghna Estuary Study to increase the physical safety and social security of the inhabitants of the Meghna Estuary area and to promote sustainable development in the coastal areas and on the islands. Under this plan a model for Sandwip area has been developed and applied for assessing the impacts of different development interventions for the purpose of land reclamation in the Meghna Estuary.A natural accretion process is going on around Sandwip the north-east part of the coastal area of Bangladesh for the last several decades. This trend emphasised on the study of possible acceleration of the accretion process by implementing artificial structures at strategic locations. However, development of an integrated management plan is essential to address the associated problems of pre and post project scenarios. Understanding the hydraulic behaviour in the Bay of Bengal is crucial before undertaking any action in connection with any development activities in the coastal area. With this end in view a hydrodynamic model study has been carried out for Sandwip area for assessing the impacts on the surrounding hydrology for different development interventions. The study has been done based on the Two Dimensional General Model of the Meghna Estuary as developed under Meghna Estuary Study Phase II. It has been found from the study that the proposed development interventions with different options have different degree of impact on the surrounding hydrology in respect of flow speed as well as net flow distribution.

This study evaluated the influence of the small-scale spatial distribution of artificial modules on infaunal community structure and associated it with the hydrodynamic and geochemical characteristics of the surrounding sediments and with fish predation pressure. Reefballs (TM) were placed on a sandy bottom on the northern coast of Rio de Janeiro in modules with a triangular set configuration with side lengths of 0.5, 5 and 15 m. The availability of potential macrobenthic prey for the reef-associated fish community was evaluated using gillnets for each inter-module distance. The input of organic matter and fine sediment into the reef complex during the rainy season favored deposit feeders. Shorter distances showed reduced fine sediment and nutrient deposition and, consequently, a lower density of deposit feeders in the infauna compared with more distant modules, which had a greater number of predators and suspension feeders. The surrounding infauna responded positively to the grain-size composition. This result suggests that transient fishes use the artificial reefs for purposes such as shelter, nursery and breeding habitats. Shifts in infaunal structure reflected the physical disturbance following the deployment of the artificial reefs and the seasonal variations but did not respond to the spatial design, showing the importance of these configuration variables and their influence on the associated infaunal community.

The mathematical models are developed to predict the environmental impacts of blue mussels, which adhere to the surface of coastal artificial structures and vary the surrounding material cycle with their feeding and respiratory activities. The existing biomass-based model is based on Scope for Growth (SFG) concept and allometric relations between body size and physiological rates. One problem of this approach is that it does not discriminate between fed and starved mussels in the mussel bed. However, mussels are usually attached to each other in several layers, with subsequent competition for food among them. Hence, some of the mussels are shoved to the inner layer of the mussel bed and must be starved due to their unfavorable position. They continue living by consuming the reserved materials little by little by means of standard respiration, therefore they does not contribute much to food ingestion and oxygen consumption rates of the mussel bed. in the present study, an individual-based model is developed to describe the dynamics of mussels as controlled by Competition for Space and Food (CSF) availability. The model consists of a physiological growth submodel based on Dynamic Energy Budget (DEB) concept and a competition submodel. Both the biomass-based and individual-based models are applied to the mussels growing on the artificial substrata suspended from the top of a pontoon type floating platform anchored in the head of Tokyo Bay in Japan. Then the observed results of growth and oxygen consumption rate of mussels are compared with the predicted results by means of both models. Consequently, the performance of the biomass-based model is sufficient when the mussel bed forms mono layer, however the performance of the individual-based model is better in the case when the mussel bed has several layers.

Understanding and accurately predicting the meteorology offshore is fundamental to efficient integration of these future wind farms into an electrical grid. Particular interest is focused on anticipating and reducing errors associated with wind ramps, which are characterized by rapid, sustained changes in wind speed over a period of hours. Using meteorological observations from a coastal buoy, we characterize 428 wind ramp-ups between 2005 and 2012 in terms of frequency, duration and magnitude, time and date of occurrence, and large-scale synoptics. From this group, we select 24 case studies that represent typical and extreme ramp-ups at this location and then model the impact that the forecasting error of these ramp-ups could have on the electrical grid. The case studies are modeled with the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model and compared with nearby buoy observations to assess forecast errors in ramp-up timing, shape, and magnitude. WRF frequently simulated ramp-ups too early, relative to observations, and often predicted the pre-ramp-up wind speed to be too high or the post-ramp-up wind speed to be too low. In the case of August 14, 2007, all three forecast errors occurred. The simulated impact on the grid is calculated by comparing the errors in forecast power with concurrent electrical load data in PJM's Mid-Atlantic Area Council-East (PJM-E) region. The largest impacts on the electrical grid were found to occur in the winter or at night in the summer. This framework allows for the identification of events that would potentially cause problems for the electrical grid in the PJM-E region.

Although density-dependent regulation of population growth is thought to be relatively widespread in nature, density-independent models are often used to project the population response to drivers of change. Such models are often considered to provide a maximum estimate of mortality and therefore offer a precautionary approach to impact assessment. However, this perception assumes that density dependence operates as compensatory (negative density dependence), and overlooks that other forms of density dependence, such as depensation (positive density dependence), would generate a contrasting population response.2. Currently, there is debate about including density-dependent mechanisms in models that assess the impact of offshore wind farms on marine bird populations. Density dependence is considered poorly understood for this group of species. Consequently, it is either excluded from assessments, or incorporated in a compensatory form that has little empirical validation.3. We reviewed the evidence for compensatory and depensatory regulation of 31 marine bird species, and conducted a meta-analysis to examine the functional shape of density-dependent population growth. The evidence was also evaluated in relation to established species-specific indices of wind farm vulnerability in order to assess whether compensatory mechanisms are likely to offset losses associated with collision or displacement.4. Compensatory regulation was reported across all of the demographic processes and focal groups considered, and was attributed to a variety of causal mechanisms. The strength of compensatory population growth appeared consistent between colonies; however, the regulation of productivity was highly context-dependent with a similar number of studies reporting compensatory, depensatory and insignificant effects. Depensation was consistently attributed to increased rates of predation at lower population densities.5. Synthesis and applications. We conclude that among marine bird species with high vulnerability to wind farms, compensatory regulation is unlikely to offset large and sustained losses from the breeding population. In addition, depensation has the potential to accelerate population declines and generate local or regional extinctions, especially in smaller colonial species. Consequently, density-independent models will not offer a consistently precautionary approach for assessing the potential impact of wind farms on marine bird populations. Instead, assessments should examine the potential population response using a range of density-dependent structures.",,,,,,,,,20,0,0,0,16,0,21,,,0021-8901,1365-2664,,,,,,,,,,"British Trust Ornithol, Thetford IP24 2PU, Norfolk, EnglandJoint Nat Conservat Comm, Inverdee House,Baxter St, Aberdeen AB11 9QA, Scotland",Joint Nat Conservat Comm,,,2017-10-01,WOS:000410678700013,,

Squid seems to aggregate at this crucial period of the life-history, which implies increasing vulnerability to fishing. Unlike those of other loliginid species, the spawning preferences of the European squid are largely unknown because finding egg clutches of this species in the wild is challenging. Validated records from research programs are virtually inexistent but unsystematic records from, for example fisherman, suggest that squid spawns regularly on artificial structures. Here, we report for first time a description of the spatio-temporal pattern of squid spawning on artificial devices (ADs). Thirty ADs were deployed over one year at a marine reserve (Cabrera National Park). ADs were distributed covering the three main types of benthic habitat, and ranging from 5 to 50 m depth. ADs were sampled monthly. Three main patters have been evidenced: (i) squid would prefer sandy bottoms for spawning, (ii) spawning would peak in spring, and (iii) squid would expand their spawning areas to shallower waters during the coldest months. It is debatable to extrapolate these patterns to those actually takes place in natural conditions. However, given the heavy fishing effort exerted on squid and data scarcity, the precautionary approach supports to take data from ADs as a starting point for advising sustainable management. Assuming that spawning at ADs and at the wild are correlated, the first pattern may be related to the faster marine currents that prevail on sandy bottoms or the smaller abundance of potential predators in these habitats. The second pattern may be related with the typical phytoplankton-zooplankton cascade that, in the Western Mediterranean, takes place just preceding spring. While the third pattern is in accordance with the hypothesis that squid may undergo a spawning migration. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

This makes wind retrievals from satellite Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) an attractive option in connection with planning of offshore wind farms. Because the wind power density is proportional to the wind speed cubed, it is important to achieve the highest possible absolute accuracy on SAR wind speed retrievals for wind energy applications. A method is presented for inter-calibration of SAR observations from Envisat and Sentinel-1A/B. Sensor-specific effects on the SAR-retrieved wind speeds are first quantified through comparisons against collocated ocean buoy observations. Based on global circulation model simulations of wind speed and direction, we retrieve the Normalized Radar Cross Section (NRCS) for different radar incidence angles. Residuals between the retrieved and the observed NRCS are used to inter-calibrate the observed NRCS before reprocessing to SAR wind fields. The inter-calibration leads to an improved agreement between SAR and buoy wind speeds with biases below 0.2 m s(-1) for all investigated SAR sensors. Estimates of the wind resource improve with respect to the buoy observations for ten of the twelve sites investigated. The average deviation between wind power densities is reduced from 20% to 8% as the SAR inter calibration leads to more conservative estimates of the wind resource.",,,,,,,,,13,0,0,0,0,0,13,,,0034-4257,1879-0704,,,,,,,,,,"Tech Univ Denmark, Dept Wind Energy, Frederiksborgvej 399, DK-4000 Roskilde, Denmark",,,,2019-10-22,WOS:000486355300044,,

We examined the influence of spatial attributes in relation to both biogenic and topographic microhabitats, in the distribution and composition of intertidal species on both artificial and natural reefs. We found higher small-scale spatial heterogeneity on the natural reef compared with the study breakwater. Species richness and diversity were associated with a higher availability of crevices, rock pools and mussels in natural habitats. Spatial distribution of certain grazers corresponded well with the spatial structure of microhabitats. In contrast, the lack of microhabitats on the breakwater resulted in the absence of several grazers reflected in lower species richness. Biogenic and topographic microhabitats can have interactive effects providing niche opportunities for multiple species, explaining differences in species diversity between artificial versus natural reefs.

Barely, 12% of these are from renewable energy sources. The majority of remaining 88% are from non-renewable sources. However, continued dependence on fossil fuels to power the growth of electricity generation capacity, is hardly sustainable. The renewable energy sources need to step up and start contributing, substantially, to the energy basket of India. Though onshore wind energy and, to a lesser extent, solar power are picking up, there has been no contribution from offshore wind energy sector as yet. India needs a policy framework to encourage the development of offshore wind farms. Several European countries, most notably the UK and Germany, have effective offshore wind energy policies that have helped them to accelerate the growth of their offshore wind energy sector.

For example, shifting production to offshore areas (e.g. wind farms) can decrease the hazards of infection due to dilution of contaminants, and increase overall health of mussels.

Gaining access to off-shore wind turbine blades is difficult and expensive e.g. with large cranes on ships or climbing with rope/platform systems. Because of the difficulty of deploying large systems off-shore, a modular approach is required to easily transport lightweight systems to test sites and assemble them quickly. A modular wall climbing robot, assembled on site, will carry the radiography deployment system up the wind tower. Two arms will extend on either side of a blade positioned in a 90 degree configuration so that the source and detector are on either side of the blade. An intelligent positioning system will keep the two aligned and normal to each other as the complex aerodynamic shape of the blade is inspected along the width of the blade. The climbing robot will then move a small distance up the tower and repeat coverage of the blade width. Allowing a full length of the blade, with inspection starting from the tip of the blade up to the blade root.An intelligent control positioning system will be required since the blade shape and curvature will be different in each horizontal plane and the source/detector will need to adapt to the shape for optimum imaging.

Coastal waters provide rich resources for the development of human society. The current in coastal waters is affected by shoreline, buildings in water and tidal current.

In this paper, the Jiu'ao Bay is taken as the object, and mathematical and physical models are used to simulate the influence of hydrodynamic force and water exchange capacity caused by different locations of intake. The simulation results show that after the construction of the water intake, the water flow is squeezed by the water intake, and the water flow is forced to deflect eastward, while the west side water flow is deflected to the south. The flow diversion of the rising tide is advanced, and the flow convergence of the falling tide is delayed. As a result, the water exchange capacity in Jiu'ao Bay is reduced.

The wind data delivered by a Regional Climate Model (RCM) are processed and analysed considering the Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) scenarios 4.5 and 8.5. The novelty of the proposed study consists in the fact that this is focused on the assessment of the expected average and extreme wind power, considering the 30-year time window 2021-2050. Furthermore, in order to make a comparison, an analysis of the historical wind data coming from the same RCM corresponding to the past 30-year period 1976-2005 is also carried out. The results indicate a slight enhancement of the wind power, which is higher for RCP4.5. Some locations where the wind power enhancement is expected to be more significant have been also identified. Finally, it can be noticed that while for the historical data the trend indicates a constant tendency, as regards the near future period (2021-2050) the trends show a tendency of enhancement of the wind power, which is higher for RCP 8.5.

The energy is needed in cities on the costs and the wind blows more steadily off shore. Wind turbines placed in shallow ocean water on rigid platforms do however raise environmental concerns and may degrade the natural beauty of beaches and coastlines. These concerns often lead to significant delays in construction and installation. Floating, far-offshore wind turbines, located farther from land in deep water, would eliminate these environmental concerns, while at the same time tapping into even greater wind power potential. While the potential for floating wind turbines is vast, they pose major engineering challenges. Not only must the turbines be stable and structurally sound when forced by large ocean waves, they must also be economical to build. The present study will develop integrated computer simulations and physical experiments to advance the state-of-the-art in modeling of floating wind turbines located in deep ocean water. The results will help us understand how such platforms behave, thus making it possible to design economical wind turbines. The intellectual merit of the proposed activity is to lay the foundation for understanding how floating platforms behave by developing numerical simulations with sufficient accuracy for the early design stages where the overall character of the system are established. In effect we will develop a numerical offshore water tank, and then validate the numerical simulations with physical experiments. The broader impact of the proposed activity is that it advances the nation's capabilities in a new renewable energy technology by developing multi-scale computational tools and physical experiments to model a complex system subject to extreme environmental loads. The need for multiscale modeling capability is needed in a broad range of applications and the success of the present project will have wide impact for related problems.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,853579,,,,,,,,Worcester Polytechnic Institute,,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:13766834,,

The implementation of the EU Birds Directive in German offshore waters requires special protection of divers that comprise mainly Red-throated and Black-throated G. arctica Divers. An important first step concerning the protection was the establishment of two Special Protection areas for birds in the EEZ of the North and Baltic Seas in 2004. Anthropogenic activities at sea, such as the construction of offshore wind farms or ship traffic, have strong impacts on divers. In the course of the ongoing marine spatial planning it is particularly important to improve the knowledge on distribution patterns and phenology of divers in the German part of the North Sea.This publication presents the most recent analysis of spatio-temporal patterns of divers in the German North Sea. By merging data from scientific projects and environmental impact studies, the data basis could be considerably improved. Divers were recorded by ship-based and aerial surveys during 2000 to 2013. Distribution patterns on a 1 km x 1 km grid were interpolated using Generalized Additive Models.The first nameable aggregations of divers during the course of the year are found in the area of East Frisia during October. Abundance values increase constantly during the following weeks. Eventually, divers are found in the whole coastal zone of the German North Sea during the winter months. Areas of main abundance shift seawards during spring with high density areas occurring in and around the Special Protection Area Eastern German Bight off the island of Sylt. Several wind farm sites overlap with hot spots of diver distribution. The mean spring population of divers in the German North Sea was calculated at 20,000 individuals for the period 2002 to 2013. Numbers in spring did not significantly increase or decrease over this period.The most recent data on diver abundance reflect certain regional, annual variability that can most likely be explained by varying abundance in bentho-pelagic fish stocks as well as by variances in the hydrodynamic systems. The core aggregation of divers during spring could constantly be found within the region of the Special Protection Area Eastern German Bight over the course of the last years. However, most recent data still underline that the core area extends west outside the borders of the protected area. Some of the wind farms already established clearly overlap with the main distribution areas of divers.",,,,,,,,,10,0,0,0,10,0,11,,,0049-6650,0049-6650,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Kiel, Forschungs and Technologiezentrum Westkuste FTZ, Hafentorn 1, D-25761 Busum, Germany",,,,2015-05-01,BCI:BCI201900241955,,

Drag coefficients are often used as one of the quantities to technically express this complexity of artificial reefs. For instance, it is well known that as a drag coefficient increases, larger eddies are generated downstream of artificial reefs so that plankton gathers more effectively around the reef. On the contrary, if the cavity of artificial reef is larger, the current flow easily passes through the reef and then plankton does not remain near the reef because the drag coefficient becomes small. This study contributes to our understanding of artificial reef deployment projects by clarifying the effect that a drag coefficient has on an artificial reef when the reef is subject currents of different direction. In addition, we elucidate the extent of vortex occurrence downstream of the artificial reef when this drag coefficient differs. The influence of the extent of this vortex was determined by comparing a drag coefficient to a swimming velocity of plankton. The maximum drag coefficient was similar to previous data obtained from a hydraulic experiment. The mean current velocity downstream of artificial reefs was faster than the swimming velocity of plankton, regardless of the drag coefficient. However, the extent of influence obtained from the distribution of vorticity magnitude was nearly similar to the vorticity obtained from potential theory.

To investigate the relationship between the coral assemblage and seascape variation in reef habitats, we took advantage of the distinct boundaries, spatial configurations, and topographic complexities among artificial reef patches to overcome the difficulties of manipulating natural reefs. Reef size (m(2)) was found to be the foremost predictor of coral richness in accordance with species-area relationship predictions. Larger reefs were also found to support significantly higher colony densities, enabling us to reject the null hypothesis of random placement (a sampling artifact) in favor of target area predictions that suggest greater rates of immigration on larger reefs. Unlike the pattern previously documented for reef fishes, topographic complexity was not a significant predictor of any coral assemblage response variable, despite the range of complexity values sampled. Lastly, coral colony density was best explained by both increasing reef size and decreasing reef spatial isolation, a pattern found exclusively among brooding species with shorter larval dispersal distances. We conclude that seascape attributes of reef size and spatial configuration within the seascape can influence the species richness and abundance of the coral community at relatively small spatial scales (< 1 km). Specifically, we demonstrate how patterns in the coral communities that have naturally established on these manipulated reefs agree with the target area and island biogeography mechanisms to drive species-area relationships in reef-building corals. Based on the patterns documented in artificial reefs, habitat degradation that results in smaller, more isolated natural reefs may compromise coral diversity.",,,,,,,,,11,0,0,0,9,0,12,,,0722-4028,1432-0975,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Miami, Rosenstiel Sch Marine & Atmospher Sci, Marine Biol & Fisheries Div, Miami, FL 33149 USA",,,,2012-12-12,WOS:000310999300002,,

Regular wave conditions were modeled in the channel. The wave channel had a 1-on-30 bottom slope. Reef models were constructed according to Froude similarity law with the scale of 1/30. Artificial reef concrete block stability and the scour contact area between the reef blocks and sand bottom were determined. In total, seven wave sets with 35 wave runs over 30-min spans were performed in the experiments to determine stability of the blocks. Tests were run using three various-sized reef models and four different bottom depths (33, 50, 66, and 83 cm).

Economic, social, environmental, and spatial dimensions were considered. The coastal counties have suitable wind resources for energy development, which could contribute toward Michigan's 10% renewable energy standard. Wind energy is cost-effective with contract prices less than the benchmark energy price of a new coal-fired power plant. Constructing a 100 MW wind farm could have a $54.7 million economic impact. A patchwork of township-level zoning ordinances regulates wind energy siting. Voluntary collaborations among adjacent townships standardizing the ordinances could reduce regulatory complexity. A Delphi Inquiry on offshore wind energy in Lake Michigan elicited considerable agreement on its challenges, but little agreement on the benefits to coastal communities. Offshore turbines could be acceptable to the participants if they reduced pollution, benefited coastal communities, involved substantial public participation, and had minimal impact on property values and tourism. The US Coast Guard will take a risk-based approach to evaluating individual offshore developments and has no plans to issue blanket restrictions around the wind farms. Models showed that using wind energy to reach the remainder of the 10% renewable energy standard could reduce SO2, NOx, and CO2 pollution by 4% to 7%. Turbines are highly likely to impact the area's navigational and defense radar systems but planning and technological upgrades can reduce the impact. The integrated assessment shows that responsible wind energy development can enhance the quality of life by reducing air pollution and associated health problems and enhancing economic development. Policies could reduce the negative impacts to local communities while preserving the benefits to the broader region.

There is a need for an adequate methodology to determine its potential impacts on seabirds. Environmental Impact Assessments (EIAs) are mostly relying on a succession of plain density maps without integrated interpretation of seabird spatio-temporal variability. Using Taylor's power law coupled with mixed effect models, the spatio-temporal variability of species' distributions can be synthesized in a measure of the aggregation levels of individuals over time and space. Applying the method to a seabird aerial survey in the Ebro Delta, NW Mediterranean Sea, we were able to make an explicit distinction between transitional and feeding areas to define and map the potential impacts of an offshore wind farm project. We use the Ebro Delta study case to discuss the advantages of potential impacts maps over density maps, as well as to illustrate how these potential impact maps can be applied to inform on concern levels, optimal EIA design and monitoring in the assessment of local offshore wind energy projects.

Numerical analysis is carried out using ANSYS AQWA under moderate, high and very high sea states. Results of studies show that aerodynamic load resonates response of deck in different degrees of freedom under moderate and high sea states. Pitch response of the deck is insignificant, verifying the satisfactory design of the conceived geometry. Statistical analyses show that the response increases with the increase in wave height and wind speed, but lesser than a surge in all sea states. Presence of current induces a shift in the mean position of surge response, and the platform oscillates at this new mean position; this shift increases with an increase in the sea states.

This expansion has derived in much bigger structures to be placed on the seabed; however, no revision about hydrodynamic regimes that should be taken into account during the design of these facilities has been carried out. The equations developed by Morison et al. in 1950 to estimate the wave loads are commonly assumed as valid within professional and scientific activity, and no revision of their investigation has been carried out since then. The formulation developed 65 years ago may not be reliable enough to accurately predict the phenomena, since they were established for smaller bodies. This paper analyses the available data from several European offshore wind farms in order to determine their hydrodynamic domain and nature of forces that structures bear. The analysis has been performed with the aim of establishing the relationship between inertia and drag forces acting on piles under wave loading conditions. Different criteria from main standards within the sphere of maritime works have been followed for the analysis. Results clearly show how inertia dominates in most cases and, consequently, the acceleration of fluid particle motion is a critical variable for predicting coastal phenomena. In this sense, this research remarks the importance of that mathematical expressions incorporate this fact, both for structural calculation and coastal process prediction and they should be reviewed in future research studies.",,,,,14th International Coastal Symposium (ICS)14th International Coastal Symposium (ICS),"MAR 06-11, 2016MAR 06-11, 2016",Univ Sydney; Geocoastal Res Grp; Coastal Educ & Res Fdn; JCRUniv Sydney; Geocoastal Res Grp; Coastal Educ & Res Fdn; JCR,"Sydney, AUSTRALIASydney, AUSTRALIA",4,0,0,0,0,0,4,,,0749-0208,1551-5036,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Politecn Madrid, Res Grp Marine Coastal & Port Environm & Other Se, E-28040 Madrid, Spain",,,,2016-03-01,WOS:000373241300033,,

Uncertainty remains, however, regarding which types of reef best deliver this aim, and how material properties impact faunal communities. The objective of this study was to assess the macrobenthic infauna in standardized reef-units made from different types of shell and rock and to quantify factors explaining community properties. 70 * 75 * 25 cm reef-units were made from cockle, mussel and oyster shells and rocks. Replicate units were placed on an intertidal sand flat of Swansea Bay (Wales, UK). After 5 months the benthic fauna was washed out of the reef-units and identified to species level. The volume of reef material, interstitial space and trapped sediment in each unit was quantified. A total of 45 invertebrate species were recorded in artificial reef-units compared with 12 species in the reef-free surrounding sands; 37 species were exclusively found in reefs. There was no significant difference between the infauna communities in different reef types in terms of univariate or multivariate diversity descriptors, but multivariate dispersion was lower among rock than shell-reef replicates. Distance-based linear models (DistLM) showed that the volume of interstitial space per reef-unit was the factor best explaining community structure, followed by properties of the trapped sediment. Species richness was significantly correlated with the volume of interstitial space and trapped sediment. Species seemed to use the reef-units fleetingly as shelter during low water, more permanently for protection, or as hunting ground for prey. The study demonstrated that artificial reef-units made of loose shell material and rocks can significantly enhance infauna diversity in sandy coastal environments. The identity of the material seems less relevant as long as it maximizes interstitial space and allows trapping of sediment. This provides practitioners with a degree of creative freedom when designing artificial reefs with the aim to enhance infauna diversity.

Underwater visual censuses of both Chromis species were carried out from 2009 to 2014. Chromis limbata tissue samples were collected and the mtDNA control region was sequenced and compared with mtDNA haplotypes from the natural range to confirm species identity, compare genetic diversity and to infer connectivity between newly established Brazilian populations. The Brazilian population of C. limbata increased significantly over the past 5years and the effect on C. multilineata is still an open question, longer time-series data will be necessary to clarify possible interactions. The molecular analyses confirmed species identity, revealed strong haplotype connectivity among Brazilian study sites and showed a low genetic diversity in Brazil when compared with the native populations, suggesting few individuals started the invasion. Four hypotheses could explain this colonizing event: C. limbata was released by aquarium fish keepers; larvae or juveniles were transported via ship ballast water; the species has rafted alongside oil rigs; they crossed the Atlantic Ocean through normal larval dispersal or naturally rafting alongside drifting objects.

Abundance was positively related to vertical relief and structural volume, and the largest numbers of individuals were observed at high volume artificial reefs (e.g., shipwrecks). This was likely due to greater refuge availability provided by artificial reefs within the study region, where structurally comparable natural habitats are rare. Atlantic goliath grouper measured via underwater video ranged in size from 36 to 214 cm total length (TL; median = 121 cm). No relationship was observed between TL and site depth or reef type.

But evidence is accumulating that environmental impacts, which lead to territorial conflicts, livelihood erosion, and political responses, contradict sustainability claims of wind power development. We synthesize conflicts emerging in coastal Ceara state, a pioneer in Brazil's rapid development of wind power. Environmental impacts caused by wind farms, which locate on dune fields and other coastal systems, create conflicts by denying traditional communities access to resources that sustain livelihoods and cultural identities. Resource-access conflicts produce political responses that seek mitigation measures, but may escalate into a wider political challenge to continued development of wind power. We highlight the importance of land-tenure policies to assure the territorial integrity of traditional communities in areas targeted for wind power implementation. Analysis of conflicts supports suggested solutions for governments, firms, and traditional communities that may be applied in other developing countries and may help investors and planners avoid future conflicts.

Moreover, detailed censuses were performed in eight transects distributed along the coastline. Results allow to estimate a total population of 32,821 adult specimens (shell maximum diameter larger than 30 mm). The population shows a well structured size/age distribution, with a wide range of sizes from young to large individuals, but specimens larger than 90 mm are scarce. Patella ferruginea is distributed in Melilla both on the natural rocky shores and on the numerous artificial structures which constitute more than a half of the littoral. It should be pointed out its abundance on the external breakwater of the Melilla port, where is concentrated the 68.1% of the estimated population. The average density of adults for the whole littoral (excluding coastal zones with unsuitable habitats for the species) is 2.8 adults/m, with a maximum value of 66.5 adults/m in a transect. Excepting zones with unsuitable substrate (beaches), P. ferruginea is lacking in the 44.0% of the littoral of Melilla, which corresponds to the inner port areas and the littoral stretches where coastal works have been done recently. Comparison between data of 2010 and 2006 shows that coastal works done during those four years may have meant the disappearance of about 1,900 adult individuals of P. ferruginea, in zones where recolonization on the new installed substrates seems to have hardly begun nowadays. Despite of that mortality, the present global estimation of the population means an increase of 69.2% with regard to the 2006 estimation, mainly due to the more detailed study of some zones, specially the external breakwater of the port.

Unlike most existing solutions this software platform is designed to be neither data-centric nor visualization-centric, but seamlessly integrating both, management and visualization of measurement data. Within the project FlexMoT (Flexible Monitoring Tool) a modular, easy-to-use and fast deployable environmental monitoring solution with a high temporal and depth resolution for underwater environments has been developed. This monitoring system was designed for the use in the underwater surrounding of offshore installations like oil rigs or gas production platforms and other critical and sensitive marine environments. It enables the exact measurement of concentration of dissolved gases such as methane in water and other environmental parameters that may be indicators of leakages. The FlexMoT software stack offers situational awareness and advanced decision support in environmental monitoring by organizing, preparing and presenting the gathered sensor data in a way that (1) operator personnel of offshore installations and marine researchers can draw the right conclusions and (2) appropriate actions can be initiated swiftly and well-informed. Similar to the modular hardware approach, the software uses a plugin approach to foster the simple reconfiguration to different use-cases. The designed visualization system utilizes human perception to transform lots of data quickly and intuitively into helpful information, to draw attention to critical events or striking data and support explorative data analysis with interactive displays. The implemented visualization solution combines recent web-technologies and linked interactive 2D and 3D data presentations utilizing a direct-touch interaction metaphor. In this paper, we present the complete software stack of FlexMoT for data management, operational near real-time monitoring, visual data analytics of marine environmental data and visual forecast of gas leakage situations.

Here we report on contrasting characteristics of three sea-breeze types on five coastlines around the southern North Sea from an 11 year model-simulated climatology. We present and test an identification method which distinguishes sea-breeze types which can, in principle, be adapted for other coastlines around the world. The coherence of the composite results for each type demonstrates that the method is very effective in resolving and distinguishing characteristics and features. Some features, such as jets and calm zones, are shown to influence offshore wind farm development areas, including the sites of the proposed wind farms up to 200 km offshore. A large variability in sea-breeze frequency between neighbouring coastlines of up to a factor of 3 is revealed. Additionally, there is a strong association between sea-breeze type on one coastline and that which may form coincidentally on another nearby. This association can be as high as 86% between, for example, the North Norfolk and East Norfolk coasts. We show, through associations between sea-breeze events on coastlines with contrasting orientations, that each coastline can be important for influencing the wind climate of another.

However, divers prefer preserved coral reefs and therefore reef degradation presents an economic loss. Artificial reefs were suggested among a range of tools to mitigate and reduce divers' negative impact on coral reefs.Coral reefs in Eilat (northern tip of the Red Sea) are among the most densely dived reefs in the world, with an estimated number of dives of up to 350,000 dives a year. At least 7 artificial reefs were deployed in the coastal waters of Eilat, however the divers' visitation on these reefs is not tracked regularly.We found that more than one third of the total dives take place on artificial reefs in Eilat. The divers prefer to vary their diving sites and possess a desire to diversify and expand their diving experience. Thus, the divers are also willing to dive a on artificial reefs, and this is true for both novice and experienced divers. This indicates that artificial reefs can draw divers from natural reefs, thus reducing diving pressure and allowing more sustainable levels of diving on natural coral reefs. This leads us to a conclusion that artificial reefs may be useful in modern reef conservation approaches. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Consequently, the demand to carry this electric power by high voltage direct current (HVDC) technology will increase too. The most suitable HVDC power transmission technology to deliver large amounts of power, exceeding a capacity of 5 GW per bipolar system over long distances with lower losses is by using compact HVDC gas insulated transmission lines (DC GIL) and gas insulated switchgears (DC GIS) with rated voltage (maximum continuous operating voltage) of +/- 550 kV and 5000 A which are presently under development worldwide. Among the critical challenges for the development of these HVDC gas insulated systems, there are the epoxy cast resin insulators that are used to separate gas compartments also called spacers. Indeed, thorough research studies have been and still being carried out to well understand and clarify the electrical insulation characteristics of HVDC spacers using mainly cylindrical samples and small insulator models, where useful results have been obtained and proposed for implementation in real compact gas insulated systems. However, few practical investigations have been undertaken on real size spacers (product scale) to verify such research outcomes and validate the reliability of the spacers to collect experiences or for commercial use. This paper reviews the current achievements of real size HVDC spacers development. It describes the basic electric field calculation and spacers design, the verification of the insulation performance and validation testing.

We examined the composition of the species and functional groups of invertebrates and fish in relation to the artificial reefs over soft-bottom and barren-ground habitats over a 10-month period. We evaluated the community structure based on species richness, biomass, species diversity, and dominance of species and functional groups. We assessed the trajectories of the ecological succession of artificial reefs planted with kelp on each bottom type and determined the changes in the dissimilarity of species and functional groups over time. We also analysed the relationship between the biogeny (of macroalgae) over time (months) and the changes in macrobenthic community structure. Successional development of reefs communities was similar across the two habitat types, macroalgae contributed most to the early stage, while invertebrates and fish were the groups that contributed the most during the middle and late successional stages. A positive relationship was found between the presence of artificial reefs with kelp seedlings and the biomass of specific species and functional groups. This study showed that new kelp habitats promote the construction of biogenic structures that increase the habitat complexity, promote biodiversity, and increase populations of commercially harvested species. In this sense, artificial reefs should be considered an important tool for restoring the function of degraded benthic ecosystems. (C) 2020 The Author(s).

We compared fish densities across midday, dusk, and night during one-hour periods using fixed-area, time-lapse photography illuminated by infrared lighting. Fish assemblages associated with both natural and artificial habitats exhibited a significant diel shift typified by a decline in total fish density at night. Cross-habitat movement by nocturnal species, especially those of Haemulidae, is a central driver of this turnover.

Twelve units of a patented naturoid artificial reef technology developed by the Hellenic Centre for Marine Research (HCMR) were deployed in 2015 in the Underwater Biotechnological Park of Crete (UBPC) in order to create an experimental diving oasis and investigate the potential of achieving this aim for the over-exploited coastal ecosystems of this part of the Eastern Mediterranean. Assessment of the degree of establishment of artificial reefs and their ability to mimic natural ecosystems is often monitored through biological surveys and sampling. The measurement of the chemical, physical, and hydrodynamic characteristics of the water mass surrounding artificial reefs is also essential to fully understand their comparison to natural reefs. In particular, the flow field around reefs has been shown to be one of the most important physical factors in determining suitable conditions for the establishment of a number of key species on reef habitats. However, the combination of biological establishment monitoring and realistic flow-field simulation using computational fluid dynamics as a tool to aid in the design improvement of already existing reef installations has not been fully investigated in previous work. They are often reported separately as either ecological or engineering studies. Therefore, this study examined a full-scale numerical simulation of the field flow around individual already installed naturoid reef shapes, and part of their present arrangement on the sea bottom of the UPBC combined with the field-testing of the functionality of the installed artificial reefs concerning fish species aggregation. The results show that the simulated flow characteristics around the HCMR diving oasis artificial reefs were in good general agreement with the results of former studies, both for flows around a single deployed unit and for flows around a cluster of more than one unit. The results also gave good indications of the performance of individual reef units concerning key desirable characteristics such as downstream shadowing and sediment/nutrient upwelling and resuspension. In particular, they confirmed extended low flow levels (less than 0.3 m/s) and in some cases double vortexes on the downstream side of reef units where observed colonization and habitation of some key fish species had taken place. They also showed how the present distribution of units could be optimized to perform better as an integrated reef cluster. The use of computational fluid dynamics, with field survey data, is therefore suggested as a useful design improvement tool for installed reef structures and their deployment arrangement for recreational diving oases that can aid the sustainable development of the coastal zone.",,,,,,,,,10,0,0,0,0,0,10,,,,2071-1050,,,,,,,,,,"Hellen Ctr Marine Res, Inst Marine Biol Biotechnol & Aquaculture, POB 2214, Iraklion 71003, Crete, GreeceUniv Patras, Dept Mech Engn & Aeronaut, Fluid Mech Lab, Patras 26054, GreeceHellen Ctr Marine Res HCMR, Inst Oceanog, Hersonissos 71500, Crete, Greece",,,,2020-06-01,WOS:000553860200001,,

Artificial reefs have been used over 40 years in the Mediterranean, mostly to deter illegal trawling in coastal areas and other sensitive habitats, which generally include important spawning and nursery areas for many commercial species. Additionally, artificial reefs are used to reduce conflicts between different fishing activities, mainly illegal trawling and small-scale fisheries operating with set gears. The objectives of most artificial reef deployments in the Mediterranean are to enhance overexploited fish stocks and improve small-scale fisheries, one of the most important activities for the coastal communities. At present, artificial reefs have been constructed in ten Mediterranean bordering countries: Cyprus, France, Greece, Israel, Italy, Malta, Principality of Monaco, Spain, Tunisia, and Turkey, excluding Portugal, which is located in the western part of the Gibraltar Strait. Research on scientific, engineering, legal, and socioeconomic aspects has strongly contributed to the success of artificial reefs around the Mediterranean and has led to drawing up specific guidelines to assist countries in artificial reef construction and avoid dumping.However, despite the large use of artificial reefs for fishery management in the Mediterranean Sea, there is still a need for additional research on the effective role of artificial reefs in stock enhancement and on the relationship between the artificial substrates and the fish species living inside and/or around the reefs. Moreover, in some Mediterranean countries, there is a lack of management measures directed toward rationally exploiting the artificial reef resources and regulating access by the different users to the reefs.The Mediterranean Sea is an inland sea surrounded by Europe, Asia, and Africa, and covering only 0.7% of the world's oceans. Due to its morphological, chemical, and biotic features, it represents one of the richest seas for biodiversity in the world hosting 7.5% of the world's animal taxa and 18% of the world's marine flora. The Mediterranean marine flora and fauna constitute a unique mixture of temperate and subtropical elements, with about 28% of endemic species.Around 150 million people, corresponding to a third of the human population that live in the bordering Mediterranean countries, live in the coastal regions and islands. Economic activities in coastal zones continue to expand and fisheries represent an important and vital sector for the human communities in these areas (UNEP-MAP-RAC/SPA, 2003).The Mediterranean continental shelf is generally narrow and fishing grounds are usually located close to the coasts. This fact, together with various political considerations, might explain why exclusive economic zones (EEZs) have not yet been established in the Mediterranean, and only fisheries protection zones have been declared in some cases. Most of Mediterranean countries have a territorial sea of 12 nautical miles and, consequently, the extent of waters under national jurisdiction in comparison with international waters is more limited than elsewhere in the European Community (European Commission, 2002).Mediterranean fisheries are a typical case of small-scale fisheries. About 80% of the EU Mediterranean vessels are smaller than 12 m and practice multispecific fishing (European Commission, 2002). Despite their important economic and social role in local communities, there are few suitable strategies and policies for promoting and managing small-scale fisheries in the Mediterranean regions. Besides political reasons, the formulation of appropriate policy measures by national and international institutions is also complicated because of the great diversity of small-scale metiers within and across countries and regions.Most of small-scale fisheries occur in coastal areas. To protect nursery areas and sensitive habitats and enhance the social sustainability of small-scale fisheries using selective gears, the use of trawl nets is prohibited in the Mediterranean Sea within 3 nautical miles of the coast or within the 50 m isobath where that depth is reached at a shorter distance from the coast. The use of trawl nets is, however, forbidden within 1.5 nautical miles of the coast (EC Regulation 1967/2006). In spite of this, trawlers often do not observe this prohibition, damaging sensitive habitats and set gears while creating conflicts with small-scale fishermen for space and resources.",,,,,9th International Conference on Artificial Reefs and Related Aquatic Habitats (CARAH)9th International Conference on Artificial Reefs and Related Aquatic Habitats (CARAH),"NOV 08-13, 2009NOV 08-13, 2009",,"Curitiba, BRAZILCuritiba, BRAZIL",6,0,0,0,4,0,7,,,2154-7769,,978-1-4398-2008-7; 978-1-4398-2007-0,,,,,,,,,"Natl Council Researchers CNIR, Inst Marine Sci ISMAR, Ancona, Italy",,,,2011-01-01,WOS:000356919700011,,

To help the designer, the ISO 19906:2010 standard provides guidance for the calculation of design ice loads using both deterministic and probabilistic approaches. In determining design loads for different environmental factors, both principal and companion actions must be taken into account; an example is iceberg actions and companion wave actions. ISO 19906 allows the designer to calculate the companion wave action as a specified fraction (combination factor) of the extreme level (EL) design wave load. Alternatively, the designer can calculate appropriate companion wave loads explicitly.A methodology has been developed at C-CORE in which representative iceberg actions are determined using a software package, the Iceberg Load Software (ILS). This is a probabilistic tool which uses Monte Carlo simulation to obtain a distribution of global impact forces based on the expected range of iceberg and environmental conditions that a structure would likely encounter. The software provides a reasonably accurate representation of the iceberg loading situation, following the provisions of ISO 19906:2010, without introducing unnecessary conservatism in the design load. In the software, the influence of waves on the iceberg actions are considered, but companion wave loads must be calculated and added externally to the software, The software accounts for the probability of different sea state conditions and the influence of the sea state on the probability and severity of iceberg impact, given the correlations between the sea state, iceberg management effectiveness and iceberg drift and wave-induced velocity.The additional hydrodynamic pressure due to the wave during the period of the impact; is not considered. This wave loading will be complicated by the influence that the presence the iceberg and structure have on the local sea state. In this paper, brief descriptions are provided of background studies on companion wave loading and the application of companion load factors in ISO 19906. The companion load factors allow the designer to apply the design wave load, which is calculated for situations with no iceberg present to the case of iceberg impacts. In this study, a methodology is presented for determining companion wave loads based on the distribution of sea states expected during an iceberg impact. These sea states are significantly less severe than that associated with the design wave load as iceberg impacts are rare events. The companion wave loads are determined without accounting for the influence of the iceberg; this is thought to be quite conservative.

Based on previous studies and on local requirements, a set of suitability criteria was developed including ocean currents, reserved areas, seabed topography, and wind speed. GIS layers were created and a weighted overlay GIS model based on the above mentioned criteria was built to identify suitable sites for hosting a new offshore wind energy farm. Results showed that most of Abu Dhabi offshore areas were unsuitable, largely due to the presence of restricted zones (marine protected areas, oil extraction platforms and oil pipelines in particular). However, some suitable sites could be identified, especially around Delma Island and North of Jabal Barakah in the Western Region. The environmental impact of potential wind farm locations and associated cables on the marine ecology was examined to ensure minimal disturbance to marine life.

Platforms provide a unique, vertically oriented substrate for fouling organisms and nekton throughout the water column and often span substantial gradients of salinity, temperature, dissolved oxygen (DO), and water clarity. During the summers of 2013 and 2014, we used paired video and hydrographic samples taken at 150 small platforms sited in nearshore waters (3.7-18.0 m water depth) to document the responses of platform-associated fishes to coastal water quality. Responses of the 26 analyzed fish species included substantial changes in habitat selection coupled with vertical habitat compression. The vertical extent of the water column suitable for fishes was compressed due to avoidance of hypoxic bottom water (DO <50% saturation) and apparent avoidance of eutrophic surface strata with supersaturated oxygen conditions (140.7 +/- 7.0% saturation [95% CI]). Generalized linear mixed models, habitat suitability indices, and factor analysis suggested that fish habitat-selection patterns varied significantly in the presence of hypoxia by up to 10 salinity units, 10 degrees C, 30% DO saturation, 6 m water depth, and 4.5 m Secchi depth.

The evolution of the profile configuration of the artificial cobble beach in Tianquan Bay can be divided into four stages. The beach was unstable during the initial stage after the beach nourishment the profile configuration changed obviously, and an upper concave composite cobble beach formed gradually, which was characterized by a steep upper part and a gentle lower part. In the second stage, the cobble beach approached dynamic equilibrium with minor changes in the profile configuration. At the third stage the beach was in a high-energy state under the influence of Typhoon Meranti, and the response of the artificial cobble beach differed significantly from that of the low-tide terrace sandy beach. Within a short time, there was net onshore transport of cobbles in the cross-shore direction. The beach face was eroded, the beach berm was accumulated, and the slope of the beach was steepened considerably. In the alongshore direction, there was notable transport of cobbles on the beach from east to west along the shore, and the total volume of the beach decreased by 4.5x10(3) m(3), which accounted for 50% of the total amount of beach volume lost within three years. The fourth stage was the restoration stage after the typhoon, characterized by a little gentler profile slope and the increase in width and the decrease in height of beach berm. Because of the action of waves and the wave-driven longshore current caused by the specific terrain and landform conditions along the coast (e.g., coastal headlands, near-shore artificial structures, and reefs), the coastline of the artificial cobble beach gradually evolved from being essentially parallel to the artificial coast upon completion to a slightly curved parabolic shape, and three distinct erosion hotspots were formed on the west side of the cape and the artificial drainpipe, and the reefs. Generally, the adoption of cobbles for beach nourishment on this macro-tidal coast beach with severe erosion has yielded excellent stability and adaptability.",,,,,,,,,8,5,0,0,1,0,13,,,1672-5182,1993-5021,,,,,,,,,,"Ocean Univ China, Coll Marine Geosci, Qingdao 266100, Shandong, Peoples R ChinaMinist Nat Resources, Inst Oceanog 3, Xiamen 361005, Fujian, Peoples R ChinaMinist Nat Resources, Isl Res Ctr, Pingtan 350400, Peoples R China",,,,2019-07-24,WOS:000474451500012,,

In marine systems, artificial reefs are often deployed to restore degraded reefs or supplement existing reefs, but it remains unknown whether these interventions benefit large predators. Comparative field surveys of thirty artificial and natural reefs across similar to 200 km of the North Carolina, USA coast revealed large reef-associated predators were more dense on artificial than natural reefs. This pattern was associated with higher densities of transient predators (e.g. jacks, mackerel, barracuda, sharks) on artificial reefs, but not of resident predators (e.g., grouper, snapper). Further analyses revealed that this pattern of higher transient predator densities on artificial reefs related to reef morphology, as artificial reefs composed of ships hosted higher transient predator densities than concrete reefs. The strength of the positive association between artificial reefs and transient predators increased with a fundamental habitat trait-vertical extent. Taller artificial reefs had higher densities of transient predators, even when accounting for habitat area. A global literature review of high trophic level fishes on artificial and natural habitats suggests that the overall pattern of more predators on artificial habitats is generalizable.

A is a colonial ascidian or sea squirt of unknown geographic origin. Colonies of Didemnum sp. A were first documented in U.S. waters in 1993 at Damariscotta River, Maine and San Francisco Bay, California. An alarming number of colonies have since been found at several locations in New England and along the West Coast of the contiguous continental United States. Originally believed to be restricted to artificial structures in nearshore habitats, such as ports and marinas, colonies of Didemnum sp. A have also been discovered on a gravel-pavement habitat on Georges Bank at depths of 40-65m. The wide distribution of Didemnum sp. A, the presence of colonies on an important offshore fishing ground, and the negative economic impacts that other species of noninidigenous ascidians have had on aquaculture operations have raised concerns about the potential impacts of Didemnum sp. A. We reviewed the available information on the biology and ecology of Didemnum sp. A and potentially closely related species to examine the environmental and socioeconomic factors that may have influenced the introduction, establishment and spread of Didemnum sp. A in U.S. waters, the potential impacts of this colonial ascidian on other organisms, aquaculture, and marine fisheries, and the possibility that it will spread to other U.S. waters. In addition, we present and discuss potential management objectives for minimizing the impacts and spread of Didemnum sp. A. Concern over the potential for Didemnum sp. A to become invasive stems from ecological traits that it shares with other invasive species, including the ability to overgrow benthic organisms, high reproductive and population growth rates, ability to spread by colony fragmentation, tolerance to a wide range of environmental conditions, apparent scarcity of predators, and the ability to survive in human dominated habitats. At relatively small spatial scales, species of Didemnum and other nonindigenous ascidians have been shown to alter the abundance and composition of benthic assemblages. In addition, the Canadian aquaculture industry has reported that heavy infestations of nonindigenous ascidians result in increased handling and processing costs. Offshore fisheries may also suffer where high densities of Didemnum sp. A may alter the access of commercially important fish species to critical spawning grounds, prey items, and refugia. Because colonial ascidian larvae remain viable for only 12[long dash]24hrs, the introduction and spread of Didemnum sp. A across large distances is thought to be predominantly human mediated; hull fouling, aquaculture, and ballast water. Recent studies suggest that colony growth rates decline when temperatures exceed 21 [degree]C for 7 consecutive days. Similarly, water temperatures above 8 to 10 [degree]C are necessary for colony growth; however, colonies can survive extended periods of time below this temperature threshold as an unidentified overwintering form. A qualitative analysis of monthly mean nearshore water temperatures suggest that new colonies of Didemnum will continue to be found in the Northeast U.S., California Current, and Gulf of Alaska LMEs. In contrast, water temperatures become less favorable for colony establishment in subarctic, subtropical, and tropical areas to the north and south of Didemnum's current distribution in cool temperate habitats. We recommend that the Aquatic Nuisance Species Task Force serve as the central management authority to coordinate State and Federal management activities. Five objectives for a Didemnum sp. A management and control program focusing on preventing the spread of Didemnum sp. A to new areas and limiting the impacts of existing populations are discussed. Given the difficulty of eradicating large populations of Didemnum sp. A, developing strategies for limiting the access of Didemnum sp.

They can compromise the safety and integrity of seafloor and subsurface infrastructures through destroying offshore installations or causing potential tsunamis. The importance of SMFs as contributors to marine geo-hazards has been recognized over the last 20-30 years, but they are seldom considered in the evaluation of quantitative offshore and coastal hazards.Significant progress has been made in investigating the SMFs worldwide due to the advances in mapping the seafloor, acquisition of high-resolution seismic profiles and sampling sediment cores. Yet, a thorough understanding of the failure conditions, the SMFs dynamics and, in particular, the induced hazards remains less developed. A timely resolution to this problem, however, is a high priority, given the catastrophic economic and human consequences of large SMFs on offshore structures and coastal areas. Moreover, the push of the industries into offshore areas and the intensive occupation of the coasts have led to a tangible increase of the risk from SMFs. For this reason, in our view, extensive work remains to be done in both understanding SMFs and quantifying their induced marine geo-hazards.This project aims to develop quantitative assessment methods for SMFs-induced marine geo-hazards. To this end, past and possible future SMF events will be studied with unprecedented details through employing quantitative geomorphic, seismic, and geotechnical analyses. This will allow characterizing the size, distribution and rheology of SMFs that, coupled with numerical modeling, will lead to accurate prediction of the mass movement and the potential of SMFs to cause tsunami. Quantitative impact assessment of SMF flow on offshore structures and SMF-induced tsunami on coastal area will be then conducted through numerical modeling. The dissemination of the results is foreseen to contribute to the mitigation of the impact of SMF on future offshore installations and also to develop the awareness of the population for possible silent (non-seismic) tsunami events.The target area is the SW Iberian Margin (SWIM) where the team has access to high-resolution bathymetric data, seismic profiles, and sediment cores. Moreover, previous works have demonstrated evidence of high landsliding potential present in the various marine environments (river deltas, continental margins, and deep-water slopes) that characterize the region.The research team of this project developed in the recent past most of the background knowledge needed to support this new step towards a more realistic estimation of the SMF-induced marine geo-hazards. It involves experts in the different scientific areas and methods, required toreach the objectives of the project. We expect that the developed methods will provide valuable insight on the characterization and configuration of SMFs in SWIM, which can be relevant for many other locations in the world.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,PTDC/CTA-GEO/30381/2017,,,,,,,,Instituto Português do Mar e da Atmosfera,Instituto Português do Mar e da Atmosfera,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:15471997,,

Wind energy production, with its relatively safer and positive environmental characteristics, has evolved in the past few decades from a marginal activity into a multi-billion dollar industry. In this research, a comprehensive evaluation model is constructed to select a suitable location for developing a wind farm. The model incorporates interpretive structural modeling (ISM), benefits, opportunities, costs and risks (BOCR) and fuzzy analytic network process (FANP). Experts in the field are invited to contribute their expertise in evaluating the importance of the factors and various aspects of the wind farm evaluation problem, and the most suitable wind farm can finally be generated from the model. A case study is carried out in Taiwan in evaluating the expected performance of several potential wind farms, and a recommendation is provided for selecting the most appropriate wind farm for construction.",,,,,,,,,40,0,0,0,0,3,42,,,,1996-1073,,,,,,,,,,"Chung Hua Univ, Dept Ind Management, Dept Technol Management, Hsinchu 300, TaiwanNatl Chin Yi Univ Technol, Dept Ind Engn & Management, Taichung 411, TaiwanNatl Chiao Tung Univ, Dept Ind Engn & Management, Hsinchu 300, TaiwanKao Yuan Univ, Dept Elect Engn, Kaohsiung 821, Taiwan",Kao Yuan Univ,,,2011-11-01,WOS:000297693000009,,

Before and after the architecture modification the fish assemblages were visually censused on the reefs and on neighbouring rocky bottoms. After manipulation of the reef structure, it was observed a significant increase of species richness (40% to 60% for the mean species number per census), of the frequency of certain species, and of total abundance (50% to 80%). This habitat modification particularly benefits Diplodus spp. (3 to 6 fold increase in D. vulgaris abundance), which are necto-benthic sparids with a relatively wide home range comprising rocky shelters. Species richness and turnover are lower on the deeper artificial reef, which is more isolated from certain biotopes (shore line, rocks, Posidonia beds) than the shallower one.

This requires an understanding of the sport-diver constituency and their particular interests and needs. In 1997, we surveyed sport divers using a mail questionnaire. Because of difficulties involved in establishing a sampling frame of saltwater divers, the study focused on divers who used dive charter boats to go diving offshore in the previous 12 months (n=1057). A response rate of 56% was achieved. On average, respondents went diving for 20 days in the previous 12 months. Most reported scuba diving is their most important outdoor recreation activity. The majority preferred to dive at depths ranging between 60 and 89 feet and preferred large naval vessels and rig jackets and other oil production structures as their materials-of-choice for future reef deployment. Results are useful for evaluating artificial reefs available in offshore Texas waters as well as input for future reef development.(C) 2002 International Council for the Exploration of the Sea.

A total of nine fish species were found. Anthias anthias followed by Clupeiformes dominated the upper zone of wreck, while in the lower zone a significant decrease in numbers of all fish species was recorded The study shows that vertical distribution is the factor most influencing the allocation of species, probably due to a greater exposure to the energy flows. In contrast, the complexity of the wreck appears to play a less important role, one that is in any case less clear.

To test how environmental heterogeneity associated with a recreational marina affects the structure of the fouling community and the benthic-pelagic link, we conducted an experiment in which predation effects on recruitment and community structure were assessed in two artificial habitats: inside the marina, an area of calm waters and often disturbed by boating activity, and the breakwater, a more hydrodynamic area. Using visual censuses and video footages we also described the predation pressure and the identity of predators on the two areas. Inside the marina, the recruitment of ascidians and serpulids, but not of bryozoans, was restricted in some occasions, possibly due to reduced water circulation. Predation, mainly by the silver porgy fish Diplodus argenteus, reduced the survivor of didemnid ascidians on both areas, but predation intensity was 40 times higher in the breakwater than inside the marina. While the two artificial habitats did not necessarily support distinct communities, low recruitment coupled to weak predation inside the marina, a less dynamic environment, likely imply lower resilience and more susceptibility to disturbance.

However, there are few studies about the efficiency of the high-rise artificial reefs, and it is not clear how effectively these reefs gather and nurse fish resources. In these large artificial reefs, it is difficult for divers to view entire schools of fish. We developed a stationary observation system called FISCHOM (fish school monitoring system) to replace or complement visual censuses conducted by divers. FISCHOM consists of a stereo camera, a programmable timer, and a battery in a stainless steel pressure-resistant housing with transparent acrylic glass rated to a depth of 80 m. FISCHOM takes periodic underwater stereo images, and its maximum duration of operation is approximately 2 months when the photographing interval is set to 1 h. By using multiple FISCHOM systems around an artificial reef, researchers can obtain quantitative data on fauna and body size compositions of the reef fish assemblages and their trends. In this study, we will try to describe the possibilities offered by FISCHOM to study the artificial reef fish assemblages.

This impact is mostly negative but, simultaneously, some of the species that colonize artificial substrata (sometimes rare or threatened) find refuge in man-made structures. The protection of endangered species is usually provided by marine protected areas or by laws that punish their damage or collection, but effective enclosure and custody must be achieved in the case of easily accessible intertidal species. We used the ferruginous limpet, Patella ferruginea, as a case study because it is the most endangered invertebrate in the Mediterranean. This species, which lives in the intertidal zone and is very accessible to people, is a free-spawning, protandric hermaphrodite, highly dependent on population density and individual size for its reproductive success. Previous work by the authors found the species is especially abundant on artificial substrates on both shores of the Strait of Gibraltar, where people collect fewer of them. Spanish laws of coastal management do not allow the enclosure of the natural coastline, but artificial installations like harbour breakwaters may be closed or guarded, and visits for educational purposes may be carried out under control. The possibility of declaring some kind of environmental protection for these artificial areas would be a very helpful tool for conservation and management purposes. Protected individuals would grow larger and eventually produce exponentially more offspring, which could be transported by currents to adjacent habitats. Here we propose a protection concept for artificial sites termed Artificial Marine Micro-Reserve (AMMR), where some endangered species experience a refuge from human disturbance. This concept is a modification of the land micro-reserves that have been recently declared in small natural sites that keep rare plant species. A network of AMMRs would be the final objective, allowing the creation of a great metapopulation of P. ferruginea and also giving refuge to other endangered species that have been found to grow in this type of substratum. Critically, the declaration of a micro-reserve cannot be used as a reason in favour of new construction because of the negative influence of such structures on the marine environment, together with the fact that there is no certainty that valuable species will settle on them.",,,,,,,,,36,1,0,0,32,0,37,,,0173-9565,1439-0485,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Seville, Lab Biol Marina, E-41012 Seville, Spain",,,,2011-03-18,WOS:000286836800002,,

It is therefore important to explore opportunities that could support the co-existence of offshore wind farms (OWFs) and fishing activity. In addition to ecological evidence on the effects of OWFs on commercially exploited species, the co-location issue requires understanding of the perceptions of fishers and OWF developers on key constraints and opportunities. Interviews were carried out in 2013 with 67 fishers in South Wales and Eastern England and with 11 developers from major energy companies, to discover experiences and opinions on the co-location of OWFs with crab and lobster fisheries. Developers expressed broad support for co-location, perceiving potential benefits to their relationship with fishers and their wider reputation. Fishers had more mixed opinions, with geographical variation, and exhibited a range of risk perception. The lack of reported experience of potting within OWFs was not related to stock concerns but to uncertainty around safety, gear retrieval, insurance and liability. Clear protocols and communication to address these issues are essential if co-location is to be feasible. Scale may also limit the potential benefits to fishers, especially in that large offshore OWFs are likely to be inaccessible to much of the inshore fleet. There remains the potential to enhance the artificial reef effects of OWFs by deploying additional material between the turbines, but options to finance such schemes, and how investment by OWF developers could be offset against compensation paid to displaced fishers, require further investigation.

However, little is known on how these post-border processes shape the genetic composition of NIS at regional scales. Here, we analyse genetic variation in introduced populations along impacted coastlines to infer demographic and kinship dynamics at the post-border stage. We used as a model system the ascidian species Microcosmus squamiger that has been introduced worldwide. This species can colonize and grow fast on man-made artificial structures, impacting activities such as mariculture. However, it can also establish itself on natural substrates, thus altering natural communities and becoming an ecological problem. We genotyped 302 individuals from eight populations established on natural and artificial substrates in the north-western Mediterranean Sea, using six microsatellite loci. We then compared the resulting genotypes with those found within the native range of the species. We found high levels of genetic diversity and allelic richness in all populations, with an overall deficit of heterozygotes. Autocorrelation analyses showed that there was no within-population genetic structure (at a scale of tens of metres); likewise, no significant differentiation in pairwise comparisons between populations (tens of kilometres apart) and no isolation-by-distance pattern was found. The results suggest that M. squamiger has a natural capacity for high dispersal from one patch of hard substrate to another and no differences whatsoever could be substantiated between natural and artificial substrates. Interestingly, two groups of genetically differentiated individuals were detected that were associated with the two ancestral source areas of the worldwide expansion of the species. Individual assignment tests showed the coexistence of individuals of these two clusters in all populations but with little interbreeding among them as the frequency of admixed individuals was only 15 %. The mechanism responsible for maintaining these genetic pools unmixed is unknown, but it does not appear to compromise post-border colonization of introduced populations.",,,,,,,,,29,0,0,0,27,0,30,,,0025-3162,1432-1793,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Barcelona, Fac Biol, Dept Genet, E-08028 Barcelona, SpainUniv Calif Davis, Dept Ecol & Evolut, Davis, CA 95616 USACSIC, CEAB, Blanes 17300, Girona, Spain",,,,2013-07-01,WOS:000320791000011,,

Along underwater visual transects, we quantified fish species richness, density, and size structure, as well as substrate structure (rugosity and cover of substrate types), giant kelp density, and invertebrate density. Artificial reefs that were more similar in physical structure to natural reefs (low relief, low rugosity, and composed of small-to medium-sized boulders) supported fish assemblages that were similar to those on natural reefs. Fish species richness was not significantly different between artificial and natural reefs, but density and biomass tended to be higher on average on artificial reefs, body size was slightly smaller, and assemblage structure differed between the two reef types. Generally, artificial reefs extended higher off the seabed, were made of larger boulders, had higher rugosity, harboured more invertebrates, and supported less giant kelp. At both the within-reef (transect) and whole-reef scales, fish density and biomass were positively correlated with complex substrate structure, positively correlated with invertebrate density, and negatively correlated with giant kelp abundance, which was sparse or absent on most artificial reefs.

Uncertainty remains, however, regarding which types of reef best deliver this aim, and how material properties impact faunal communities. The objective of this study was to assess the macrobenthic infauna in standardized reef-units made from different types of shell and rock and to quantify factors explaining community properties. 70 x 75 x 25 cm reef-units were made from cockle, mussel and oyster shells and rocks. Replicate units were placed on an intertidal sand flat of Swansea Bay (Wales, UK). After 5 months the benthic fauna was washed out of the reef-units and identified to species level. The volume of reef material, interstitial space and trapped sediment in each unit was quantified. A total of 45 invertebrate species were recorded in artificial reef-units compared with 12 species in the reef-free surrounding sands; 37 species were exclusively found in reefs. There was no significant difference between the infauna communities in different reef types in terms of univariate or multivariate diversity descriptors, but multivariate dispersion was lower among rock than shell-reef replicates. Distance-based linear models (DistLM) showed that the volume of interstitial space per reef-unit was the factor best explaining community structure, followed by properties of the trapped sediment. Species richness was significantly correlated with the volume of interstitial space and trapped sediment. Species seemed to use the reef-units fleetingly as shelter during low water, more permanently for protection, or as hunting ground for prey. The study demonstrated that artificial reef-units made of loose shell material and rocks can significantly enhance infauna diversity in sandy coastal environments. The identity of the material seems less relevant as long as it maximizes interstitial space and allows trapping of sediment. This provides practitioners with a degree of creative freedom when designing artificial reefs with the aim to enhance infauna diversity.",,,,,,,,,14,0,0,0,10,0,15,,,,2296-7745,,,,,,,,,,"Swansea Univ, Biosci, Swansea, W Glam, Wales",,,,2019-02-13,WOS:000457368700001,,

The work is advancing a fundamental understanding of soil-structure interactions to develop a novel and sustainable foundation concept for offshore wind turbines: a Flying Wing Anchor. This anchor is a steel plate in the shape of an aerodynamically efficient winged aircraft. The anchor is installed silently and efficiently using gravity from free fall through the water column and penetration into the sea floor. Tension in the line that attaches the wind turbine structure to the anchor causes the anchor to dive and pitch toward the horizontal in service, maximizing the available holding capacity in bearing over the full wing surface in an extreme load. The intellectual challenges are (1) modeling the resistance of soil against a foundation in shear and bearing over the orders-of-magnitude range of strain rates corresponding to free-fall penetration, line pre-tensioning and ultimately storm loading and (2) capturing the dynamic, fully six-degree-of-freedom movement of a foundation as it flies through the soil during installation and service. The research plan comprises a comprehensive approach to physically testing scale models of a Flying Wing Anchor during penetration and in-service loading and numerically modeling the three-dimensional behavior with time of a Flying Wing Anchor with the Finite Element Method (FEM) and advanced constitutive models. It capitalizes on a U.S.-Ireland Research and Development Partnership Program to bring together a multidisciplinary, multiple-institution team that represents the European state-of-the art in offshore wind development and the U.S. state-of-the-art in offshore foundations. The project partners include The University of Texas at Austin, the University of Rhode Island, University College Dublin and Queen's University Belfast. With external funding from Invest NI and Science Foundation Ireland, the U.S. investment in this project is leveraged at a ratio of nearly 3 total dollars for each dollar invested from NSF. This research has the potential to improve foundation systems over a wide range of offshore and onshore applications by developing a green foundation concept, where nature initially installs it through gravity and then completes the installation through in-service loading. This research aims to reduce the economic and environmental cost of harnessing offshore wind energy, which is a key challenge to increasing the availability of renewable energy. This research will benefit society at large by providing cross-country and cross-Atlantic education and research opportunities for graduate and undergraduate students, by fostering excitement in engineering and science for school children through exposing them to the development of a novel concept and giving them an opportunity to examine it themselves through a model testing facility, and by increasing public awareness of the promises and challenges of renewable energy through public demonstrations and workshops.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,1301211,,,,,,,,University of Texas at Austin,,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:13754083,,

One of the challenges for policy makers is the need to monitor the effectiveness of management actions. In this study, a meta-analysis across different bays, covering a large spatial scale in Atlantic Canada, was performed to test the response of two potential indicators of aquaculture intensity: (1) the bivalve growth using both Dynamic Energy Budget (DEB) and Scope For Growth (SFG) approaches, and (2) the bivalve condition index (CI = (meat weight/shell weight) x 100). Our underlying premise was that overstocking of bivalves leads to increased competition for food resources, which might ultimately have a significant effect on bivalve growth performance and the Cl. Bivalve growth performance for cohorts of Mytilus edulis and Crassostrea virginica were simulated by combining satellite remote sensing (temperature and chlorophyll) with individual based models using both DEB and SFG approaches. These models were calibrated for each cohort, by adjusting the half-saturation coefficient of the food ingestion function term (X-K), which is a common parameter related to feeding behavior in both approaches. A significant correlation between X-K and lease coverage (lease area/bay area, dimensionless) was found for M. edulis. However, because of unrealistic X-K values in some M. edulis cohorts and the lack of consistent simulations for C. virginica precluded using X-K as a reliable indicator of aquaculture intensity. By contrast, according to the observed results CI emerged as a good indicator of aquaculture intensity for both species. A General Additive Model (GAM) for C. virginica provided a regression that included the initial dry meat weight as a linear term and the lease area as a non-linear term, explaining a total deviance of 59.9% in describing final CI values. The GAM for M. Mulls included only non-linear terms, lease coverage, and lease area, explaining a total deviance of 61.0%. Since the CI theoretically integrates the effects of changing trophic conditions over time, the good relationship between the CI and lease/bay characteristics provides a scientific framework for its use as a reliable ecological indicator of aquaculture intensity. From an applied perspective, this finding is of relevance because the CI is easy to measure and is widely available in government and industry datasets. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

In the dry season the delta is also impacted by salinity intrusion and tides. These effects have caused severe human hardship. To mitigate these impacts, a large number of engineering structures, primarily dykes and weirs, have been built in the delta in recent years and are still being built, mainly to control floods and saltwater intrusion. These control measures are still being upgraded. A GIS-linked numerical model shows that the flood levels in the delta depend on the combined impacts of high river flows in the Mekong River, storm surges, sea level rise, and the likely, future siltation of the Mekong Estuary resulting from the construction of dams in China as well as many other dams proposed throughout the remaining river catchment. The model suggests that the engineering structures in the delta increase the flow velocities in the rivers and canals, increasing bank erosion, and cause the water to be deeper in the rivers and canals. This increases flooding in the non-protected areas of the delta and increases the risk of catastrophic failure of the dykes in the protected areas. The model also predicts that a sea level rise induced by global warming will enhance flooding in the Mekong River delta in Vietnam, and that flooding may worsen in the long term as a result of estuarine siltation resulting from the construction of dams. At the scale of the Mekong River basin, a multinational water resources management plan is needed that includes the hydrological needs of the delta. At the scale of the delta, a compromise is needed between allowing some flooding necessary for agriculture and preventing catastrophic flooding to alleviate human suffering. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

This study aimed to answer: (I) Can an artificial water body provide suitable habitat for an endangered seahorse species? And if so (II) what characteristics of this new habitat are important in terms of seahorse utilization? Four major habitat types were identified within the marina canals: (I) artificial reno mattress (wire baskets filled with rocks); (II) Codium tenue beds; (III) mixed vegetation on sediment; and (IV) barren canal floor. Seahorses were found throughout the marina system with significantly higher densities within the reno mattress habitat.

We examined the regional-scale effects of marine artificial habitats on the distribution and abundance of assemblages of ascidians, a key group of ecosystem engineer species in benthic fouling systems.Location Five hundred kilometers of coastline in the North Adriatic Sea.Methods We sampled a variety of natural reefs, marine infrastructures and marinas, and tested hypotheses about the role of habitat type and location in influencing the relative distribution and abundance of both native and non-indigenous species.Results Assemblages differed significantly between natural and artificial habitats and among different types of artificial habitats. Non-indigenous species were 2-3 times more abundant on infrastructures built along sedimentary coastlines than on natural rocky reefs or infrastructures built close to rocky coastlines. Conversely, native species were twice as abundant on natural reefs than on nearby infrastructures and were scarce to virtually absent on infrastructures built along sedimentary coasts. The species composition of assemblages in artificial habitats was more similar to that of marinas than of natural reefs, independently of their location.Main conclusions Our results show that marine infrastructures along sandy shores disproportionally favour non-indigenous over native hard bottom species, affecting their spread at regional scales.

To eliminate the dimension effect of sub-indexes, normalization process was used. An analytic hierarchy process was used to assign a threshold or the ecological indicator. The synthetic health index was used to assess the health status of the artificial reef areas, radiation areas and contrast areas. Sub-indexes of artificial reef ecosystem health assessments included physical, chemical, and biological factors. Assessment standards were based on seawater quality, standard marine sediment quality, and guidance for the assessment of coastal marine ecosystem health. We conducted a series of ecosystem health assessments of artificial reefs, and radiation and control areas of Danglang Island based on the survey results of 5 voyages in 2013[approximately]2015. The results showed that the ecosystem of artificial reef areas was in a healthy state, whereas the control area was in a sub-healthy state. From the highest to the lowest, the ecological health index was: The three reef area (0.783)>radiation areas (0.646)>control area (0.594). Compared with non-reefing, the ecosystems of the reef and radiant areas were all separated from the sub-healthy state and gradually improved, however, the control area was still in a sub-healthy state and its development was unstable. Therefore, the conclusion was that the ecosystem of the artificial reef areas of Danglang Island were more stable than the control areas, and ecosystem health of radiation areas, was gotten better, due to effect of reefs.

But what makes an outdoor space beautiful? Does a beautiful outdoor location differ from an outdoor location that is simply natural? Here, we explore whether ratings of over 200000 images of Great Britain from the online game Scenic-Or-Not, combined with hundreds of image features extracted using the Places Convolutional Neural Network, might help us understand what beautiful outdoor spaces are composed of. We discover that, as well as natural features such as Coast, Mountain and Canal Natural, man-made structures such as Tower, Castle and Viaduct lead to places being considered more scenic. Importantly, while scenes containing Trees tend to rate highly, places containing more bland natural green features such as Grass and Athletic Fields are considered less scenic. We also find that a neural network can be trained to automatically identify scenic places, and that this network highlights both natural and built locations. Our findings demonstrate how online data combined with neural networks can provide a deeper understanding of what environments we might find beautiful and offer quantitative insights for policymakers charged with design and protection of our built and natural environments.

We modify the Places CNN to instead predict the scenicness of an image. We fine-tune our CNN using 80% of the Scenic-Or-Not dataset [2], and use the remaining 20% test set to check our prediction accuracy.

Polychaetes, bivalves and ascidians showed an extended settlement period in summer and autumn. Algae and sponges were recruited in winter. Bryozoans and barnacles generally recruited year round. The pioneer colonizers of the artificial reef were, therefore, a feature of the deployment season. Most recruits settled on the laterally exposed and top surfaces of the reef blocks whereas the sheltered and bottom surfaces had the greatest bare areas. The present study shows that PFA (pulverised fuel ash)-containing concrete (25%, 50% and 75% of PFA by volume), does not differ from true concrete in terms of diversity and eveness recruitment studies. Of the 27 recorded attaching species, only seven showed variations in recruitment between block types. It may be assumed, therefore, that the coal-waste concrete substrata are environmentally friendly to Hong Kong's common species of marine life and that artificial reefs made from such mixes have a role to play in restoration ecology.",,,,,,,,,11,0,0,0,5,0,11,,,1011-4041,,,,,,,,,,,"Department of Ecology and Biodiversity, Swire Institute of Marine Science, University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China",,,,2001-01-01,ZOOREC:ZOOR13800025919,,

Marine wind farms have attracted substantial public interest. The construction of wind facilities offshore may become Europe's most extensive technical development in marine habitats. Due to political pressure to complete construction soon, assessments of possible wind farm locations, for example in the German sectors of the North Sea and Baltic Sea, have to be based on existing knowledge.2. In this study, we developed a wind farm sensitivity index (WSI) for seabirds. We applied this index to the Exclusive Economic Zone and the national waters of Germany in the North Sea. We chose nine factors, derived from species' attributes, to be included in the WSI: flight manoeuvrability; flight altitude; percentage of time flying; nocturnal flight activity; sensitivity towards disturbance by ship and helicopter traffic; flexibility in habitat use; biogeographical population size; adult survival rate; and European threat and conservation status. Each factor was scored on a 5-point scale from 1 (low vulnerability of seabirds) to 5 (high vulnerability of seabirds). Five of these factors could be dealt with by real data but four could only be assessed by subjective considerations based on at-sea experience; in the latter cases, suggestions of the first author were independently modulated by experts.3. Species differed greatly in their sensitivity index (SSI). Black-throated diver Gavia arctica and red-throated diver Gavia stellata ranked highest (= most sensitive), followed by velvet scoter Melanitta fusca, sandwich tern Sterna sandvicensis and great cormorant Phalacrocorax carbo. The lowest values were recorded for black-legged kittiwake Rissa tridactyla, black-headed gull Larus ridibundus and northern fulmar Fulmarus glacialis.4. A WSI score for areas of the North Sea and Baltic Sea was calculated from the species-specific sensitivity index values. Coastal waters in the south-eastern North Sea had values indicating greater vulnerability than waters further offshore throughout the whole year.5. Derived from the frequency distribution of the WSI, we suggest a 'level of concern' and a 'level of major concern' that are visualized spatially and could act as a basis for the selection of marine wind farm locations.6. Synthesis and applications. The wind farm sensitivity index might be useful in strategic environmental impact assessments (EIA). Results of small-scale EIA from wind installations should be considered within a more global perspective, provided, for example, by large mapping projects and detailed behavioural studies. This is difficult in normal EIA, particularly in highly dynamic coastal/marine habitats, and the results of this study fill an important gap by providing information on the potential sensitivity of seabirds and the importance of locations of wind installations.",,,,,,,,,177,0,0,0,142,0,200,,,0021-8901,,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Kiel, Res & Technol Ctr FTZ, D-25761 Busum, GermanyInselstn Helgoland, Inst Avian Res Vogelwarte Helgoland, D-27494 Helgoland, Germany",Inselstn Helgoland,,,2004-08-01,WOS:000222721600013,,

This article discusses The Cooperative Participatory Evaluation of Renewable Technologies on Ecosystem Services (CORPORATES) research project, which developed an innovative and practical method of linking ecological processes, ecosystem services and benefits. The research was conducted in the context of licensing decisions for offshore wind farms in the North Sea (Scotland, UK).A set of linked, modular participatory processes were developed to foster cross-sector stakeholder engagement. It employed an exchange of ecological, legal, social, economic and cultural knowledge around marine ecosystem services. Workshop exercises included participatory mapping, benefit identification, and developing an understanding of linkages between ecosystem services, benefits, stakeholders' activities and policy drivers through co-development of conceptual systems maps of the study area.The participatory exercises fostered meaningful dialogue across sectors and an ability to participate equally, despite initial differences in knowledge about ecosystem services. The development of conceptual systems maps facilitated productive discussion about trade-offs in relation to different policies. Reflective discussion identifies ways in which the developed processes could be integrated into future decision making.An assessment of the approach revealed that it operationalised a post normal science framework in terms of process oversight, multiple knowledge claims, and managing uncertainty. It developed a process that linked understanding of ecosystem functioning with the creation and implementation of policy thereby creating an ecosystem approach to marine spatial planning and licensing decisions, as required by law.This approach has extensive transferability to situations where stakeholder engagement is required to develop policy and provide feedback as part of a decision-making process.

These surveys identified 66 fish taxa (lowest taxon: 58 species, five genera, three families), and 65 taxa were used in community comparisons. Artificial reefs were dominated by Red Snapper Lutjanus campechanus (35.3% of total fish observed), Tomtate Haemulon aurolineatum (22.4%), Vermilion Snapper Rhomboplites aurorubens (19.5%), Atlantic Spadefish Chaetodipterus faber (7.0%), Greater Amberjack Seriola dumerili (3.0%), and Gray Triggerfish Balistes capriscus (1.8%). These six most abundant species comprised 89% of the total number of individuals observed. Red Snapper and Greater Amberjack mean sizes (total length mm) were larger at big reefs, Vermilion Snapper and Atlantic Spadefish were larger at tank reefs, and Tomtates were larger at small reefs. Red Snapper, Atlantic Spadefish, and Greater Amberjacks were larger at reefs on the outer shelf, and Red Snapper, Tomtates, Vermilion Snapper, Atlantic Spadefish and Greater Amberjacks were larger in the spring. Richness and Shannon-Wiener diversity indices were higher on big reefs and tank reefs compared to small reefs. Evenness, richness, and Shannon Wiener diversity were lower in winter compared to other seasons. Fish assemblages, based on Bray Curtis similarities, were different among reef type, location, and season, but no interactions effects were identified. In the present study, fish assemblages on big reefs were more similar to assemblages on tank reefs in comparison to small reefs. The larger size, longer life span, and relative stability of the big reefs and tank reefs were the reef attributes most likely responsible for these assemblage associations. Similarly, more stable conditions at deeper depths (less affected by tropical storms) and proximity to deepwater reef fish communities (e.g., pinnacle reefs) most likely influenced the increased assemblage diversity on the artificial reefs at outer-shelf locations. Diversities and densities were highest during the fall. This was most likely due to increased recruitment of tropical species and new age-0 recruits that were spawned during the same year. The attributes of all artificial reefs are not identical; consequently, it is important for managers to consider how reef type, shelf location, and season affect each species' affinity and association with artificial reefs.",,,,,Symposium on Marine Artificial Reef Research and Development: Integrating Fisheries Management ObjectivesSymposium on Marine Artificial Reef Research and Development: Integrating Fisheries Management Objectives,"AUG 22-23, 2017AUG 22-23, 2017",,"Tampa, FLTampa, FL",6,0,0,0,3,0,8,,,0892-2284,,978-1-934874-51-6,,,,,,,,,"Auburn Univ, Sch Fisheries Aquaculture & Aquat Sci, 8300 State Highway 104, Fairhope, AL 36532 USA",,,,2019-02-13,WOS:000456750700003,,

Therefore, renewable, sustainable, and economically viable energy sources are needed as alternatives to fossil fuels. The facilities and installation costs for generating renewable energy is much higher than the cost of fossil fuel facilities. Thus, governments need effective policies, regulations, and incentive programs to promote the usage of renewable energy. Renewable energy can be classified into different categories, such as offshore and onshore wind power, photovoltaic solar power, and geothermal generated power. The policies used for promoting specific categories vary significantly. These policies depend on the policy goals, regulations, taxation, incentives, and promotional schemes. The purpose of this study is to apply clustering techniques and the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) to analyze types of renew able energies and their attributes with respect to economic factors, energy resources and supplies, and their environmental effects. The AHP approach is used to evaluate actions that can resolve challenges found in the development of renewable energy. The study provides scientific results to help government managers plan renewable energy policies. The data for the case study are collected from Taiwan's renewable energy statistics related to photovoltaic cells, wind farms, ocean thermal energy, geothermal energy, hydro power, and solid waste fuels. The research has two major results and findings. First, analytic models are developed for the decision support of renew able energy policies using intelligent clustering techniques. Second, the most suitable policies for promoting four renewable energy clusters are identified using the AHP approach.",,,,,IEEE 18th International Conference on Computer Supported Cooperative Work in Design (CSCWD)IEEE 18th International Conference on Computer Supported Cooperative Work in Design (CSCWD),"MAY 21-23, 2014MAY 21-23, 2014","IEEE; Natl Tsing Hua Univ; IEEE Systems, Man, & Cybernet SocIEEE; Natl Tsing Hua Univ; IEEE Systems, Man, & Cybernet Soc","Hsinchu, TAIWANHsinchu, TAIWAN",4,0,0,0,0,0,5,,,,,978-1-4799-3776-9,,,,,,,,,"Natl Tsing Hua Univ, Dept Ind Engn & Engn Management, Hsinchu, Taiwan",,,,2015-01-14,WOS:000346136400127,,

Vogelwarte 49: 105-110.An expansion of offshore wind energy production could lead to a significant loss of wintering and staging habitats for seabirds. To assess the impact of wind farms before, during and after their construction, the standard investigation concept of the Federal Maritime and Hydrographic Agency (BSH) currently recommends ship- and aircraft-based bird surveys. Observation-based aerial surveys, however, have methodological disadvantages: Low flight elevation (78 m), necessary for species recognition, and high flight speed in combination with large numbers of birds allow only rough population estimates. In addition, aircrafts flying at this elevation disturb resting birds, further obstructing their quantification. In this pilot study, we compared visually estimated seabird numbers collected during an aerial transect survey with numbers derived from digital aerial photographs of the same transects. The photographic survey was carried out shortly before the visual survey at a height of 200 m above sea level using a high-resolution digital camera (39 Mega pixels). 415 vertical photos corrected for geometry and scale were taken at regular intervals along defined transects. The results of this study suggest that the observational survey significantly underestimated the number of sea ducks. The difference between visual and photographic methods varied considerably among species: 85% (Common Eider, Somateria mollissima), 41% (Long-tailed Duck, Clangula hyemalis) and only 2% (Common Scoter, Melanitta nigra) of the photographically documented individuals were observed.

Most of the offshore wind turbines installed to date are located in relatively shallow water and are mounted on fixed bottom support structures. Given the limitation of suitable shallow water sites available with high wind resources and also to reduce the environmental and visual impact of turbines, it is necessary to extend wind turbines to deeper water through the development of floating offshore wind turbine (FOWT) systems, which mount wind turbines on floating support platforms. The project aims to fill an important gap in the design, manufacturing and testing of emerging FOWT techniques by specifically characterising extreme loading on FOWTs under complex and harsh marine environments. These are typically represented by storm conditions consisting of strong wind, extreme waves, significant current, rising sea level and complex interplay between these elements, through a coordinated campaign of both advanced CFD modelling and physical wave tank tests. This has direct relevance to the current and planned activities in the UK to develop this new technology in offshore wind. In addition, the project aims to develop a suite of hierarchical numerical models that can be applied routinely for both fast and detailed analysis of the specific flow problem of environmental (wind, wave, current) loading and dynamic responses of FOWTs under realistic storm conditions. As an integral part of the project, a new experimental programme will be devised and conducted in the COAST laboratory at the University of Plymouth, providing improved understanding of the underlying physics and for validating the numerical models. Towards the end of the project, fully documented CFD software and experimental data sets will be released to relevant industrial users and into the Public Domain, so that they may be used to aid the design of future support structures of FOWTs and to secure their survivability with an extended envelope of safe operation for maximum power output.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,EP/T00424X/1,,,,,,,,"City, University of London","City, University of London",,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:15297697,,

A reliable and realistic statistical multivariate model is essential to produce a representative estimate of the sea state for understanding the ocean conditions. Therefore, an advanced modeling of ocean parameters helps towards improving ocean and coastal engineering practices. In this paper, we introduce the concepts of asymmetric copulas for the modeling of multivariate ocean data. In contrast to extensive previous research on the modeling of symmetric ocean data, this study is focused on capturing asymmetric dependencies among the environmental parameters, which are critical for a realistic description of ocean conditions. This involves particular attention to both nonlinear and asymmetrically dependent variates, which are quite common for the ocean variables. Several asymmetric copula functions, capable of modeling both linear and nonlinear asymmetric dependence structures, are examined in detail. Information on tail dependencies and measures of asymmetric dependencies are exploited. To demonstrate the advantages of asymmetric copulas, the asymmetric copula concept is compared with the traditional copula approaches from the literature using actual environmental data. Each of the introduced copula models is fitted to a set of ocean data collected from a buoy at the US coast. The performance of these asymmetric copulas is discussed and compared based on data fitting and tail dependency characterizations.

Although no actual measurements were made, offshore wave heights were estimated to have been as high as 16 m. This paper deals with the effects of this Category 4 hurricane on South Carolina's system of nearshore and offshore marine artificial reefs, many of which were in the direct path of the storm. Observations and measurements were made on the reefs over a period of 2 years following the storm to assess structural damage, movement of reef materials, environmental effects and biological impacts of the hurricane on reef structures of varying designs (scrap to manufactured materials), ages (<1 to 20+ yrs) and water depths (5 to 33 m). Detected damage to reef materials was slight and movement of materials was minimal overall. However, movement of small reef structures in one instance exceeded 1.9 km, and movement of one 140 m long ship in 33 m of water was documented. Effects of the storm on artificial reef fish communities as well as resident epibenthic invertebrates were minimal and short term in nature, with no quantifiable detrimental impacts observed. Water turbidity in the vicinity of many of the reefs was dramatically increased for over a year following the storm due to the input of large quantities of estuarine mud into coastal waters.

Beside of removing the infrastructure, there are numerous possibilities for its future use. Paper analyses possible use of offshore infrastructure for blue energy production from wind. The conversion of excess electricity into chemical energy, which can easily be stored, can be achieved using P2G (Power-to-Gas) technologies. Chemical conversion units performing a balancing for the power system and transformers needed for electricity transportation from offshore wind farms can be built on oil and gas platforms. The main contribution of the paper, based on a case study of the Northern Adriatic, includes hydrocarbon production prediction, electricity generation and hydrogen production based on wind potential calculation and synthetic natural gas production analysis. Energy production comparison of different technologies and conversion efficiencies have been given. Authors found that the most beneficial reuse option for offshore facilities is electricity generation from wind.

A more limited case study review identifies monitoring and management as crucial factors, noting a significant lack of information relating to ownership, liability, regulation, user conflict, environmental assessment and long-term management goals. An assessment of reef performance indicates that only 50% of the case studies meet their objectives, the remainder having no, little or limited success. Questions are therefore raised regarding their value.

Laws require that a platform at the end of its production life be totally removed unless the submerged jacket section continues as a reef under state sponsorship. Consideration of the eventual fate of the populations of fishes and invertebrates beneath platforms has led to global reefing of the jacket portion of platforms instead of removal at the time of decommissioning. The construction and use of artificial reefs are centuries old and global in nature using a great variety of materials. The history that led to the reefing option for platforms begins in the mid-20th century in an effort for general artificial reefs to provide both fishing opportunities and increase fisheries production for a burgeoning U.S. population. The trend toward reefing platforms at end of their lives followed after the oil and gas industry installed thousands of standing platforms in the Gulf of Mexico where they had become popular fishing destinations. The National Fishing Enhancement Act and subsequent National Artificial Reef Plan laid the foundation for Rig-to-Reefs. Reefing platforms in the Gulf of Mexico is a well-established practice that is also applied globally. Deliberation of reefing decommissioned platforms and many years of scientific study beneath California platforms has culminated in a California State law that now allows consideration of the concept. This paper summarizes the history, practices, published science, and available information involved when considering the reefing option.

Here, optical properties of dry and wet marine-harvested plastic debris were quantified to explore the feasibility of plastic debris optical remote sensing in the natural environment. We measured the spectral reflectance of microplastics (< 5 mm) from the North Atlantic Ocean, macroplastics (> 5 mm) washed ashore along the USA west coast and virgin plastic pellets over a wavelength range from 350 to 2500 nm. Compared to the spectral variability of multi-colored dry macroplastics, the measured dry marine-harvested microplastic reflectance spectra could be represented as a single bulk average spectrum with notable absorption features at similar to 931, 1215, 1417 and 1732 nm. The wet marine-harvested microplastics had similar spectral features to the dry microplastics but the magnitude was lower over the measured spectrum. When spectrally matched to the reference library of typical dry virgin pellets, the mean dry marine-harvested microplastics reflectance had moderate similarities to low-density polyethylene, polyethylene terephthalate, polypropylene and polymethyl methacrylate. This composition was consistent with the subset sampled with the Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectrometer and what has been reported globally. The absorption features at 1215 and 1732 nm were observable through an intervening atmosphere and used to map the distributions of synthetic hydrocarbons at a landfill and on man-made structures from airborne visible-infrared imaging spectrometer (AVIRIS) imagery, indicating the potential to remotely sense dry washed ashore and land-origin plastics. These same absorption features were identifiable on wet marine-harvested microplastics, but the ability to conduct remote sensing of microplastics at the ocean surface layer will require more detailed radiative transfer analysis and development of high signal-to-noise sensors.

The aim of this research was to study the fish communities associated with four shipwrecks, by means of underwater visual censuses performed by a remotely operated vehicle, and to test the differences in composition of fish assemblages between these shipwrecks and the adjacent soft bottoms, considered as control sites. Multivariate analysis on the total fish assemblage showed significant differences between wrecks and controls. Results also showed higher levels of species richness and abundance near all wrecks than at a short distance from them on soft bottoms, thus indicating that these sunken vessels, thanks to their higher habitat complexity, act as artificial reefs, attracting aggregations of fish species and leading to a greater diversification of the local fish assemblage. Nevertheless, shipwrecks, which are an ideal target for recreational fishermen, could contribute to the over-exploitation of some high-value fish species, such as Mycteroperca rubra, Dentex dentex and Diplodus spp., attracted by the artificial hard substrate of the vessel-reefs. The recent European directives suggest an urgent need for a better understanding of the crucial role played by these potential sources of pollutants on marine environments and ecosystems.

This paper examines artificial coral reefs as recreational ecosystem services (RES) by evaluating their attractiveness and effectiveness and by examining divers' attitudes toward them. An online survey targeted at divers in Israel (n = 263) indicated that 35% of the dives in Eilat (a resort city on the shore of the Red Sea) take place at artificial reefs. A second study monitored divers' behavior around the Tamar artificial reef, one of the most popular submerged artificial reefs in Eilat, and juxtaposed it with divers' activities around two adjacent natural reefs. Findings show that the average diver density at the artificial reef was higher than at the two nearby natural knolls and that the artificial reef effectively diverts divers from natural knolls. A third study that examined the attitudes towards natural vs. artificial reefs found that the artificial reefs are considered more appropriate for training, but that divers feel less relaxed around them. By utilizing the RES approach as a framework, the study offers a comprehensive methodology that brings together the aesthetic, behavioral, and attitudinal aspects in terms of which artificial reefs can be evaluated.

The consequences of increased use of these devices for birds are unknown. Here we describe the wave-powered energy-generating devices currently either operational or in development and review the potential threats and benefits of these to marine birds, their habitats and prey. Direct negative effects include risk of collision, disturbance, displacement and redirection during construction, operation and decommissioning. Above-water collision is a particular concern with wind-powered devices, but, because of their low profiles, the collision risk associated with wave-powered devices is likely to be much lower. Conversely, wave devices also pose the novel threat of underwater collision. Wave-energy-generating devices may indirectly impact marine birds by altering oceanographic processes and food availability, with implications for trophic cascades. Through appropriate mitigation, wave-powered MREIs offer the potential to enhance habitats. Direct positive effects may include provision of roosting sites, and indirect positive effects may include prey aggregation due to suitable substrates for sessile organisms or because they act as de facto protected areas. The cumulative effect of these could be the improvement and protection of foraging opportunities for marine birds. Recent studies have been critical of the methods used in the assessment of wind-powered MREI impacts, which lack sufficient sample sizes, controls or pre-development comparisons. Here we suggest solutions for the design of future studies into the effects of MREIs.

We focus largely on primary production, as this ecosystem process necessarily constrains the secondary production of fish and invertebrates. We use this ecosystem ecology viewpoint to examine the long-standing attraction/production question-do artificial reefs support 'new' fish production or simply attract individuals from other habitats? Central to this discussion is identifying ecological thresholds and self-reinforcing feedbacks. For example, biological or physical processes may facilitate reaching nutrient supply thresholds where fundamental ecological dynamics are shifted, such as enhanced seagrass allocation of resources to above-ground plant structures following aggregation of fish around reefs.

First, deploying protected HMRs can help to mitigate the depletion of fishery stocks through overharvest and habitat degradation. Secondly, to achieve this objective effectively, it is essential that HMRs are protected as no-take areas, and that, thirdly, HMRs are large, well-planned, evaluated and monitored. Finally, ecosystem modelling and adaptive management responses are necessary to forecast and manage the benefits of HMRs. Moreover, uncertainty about the resolution of the well-rehearsed attraction/production debate may be resolved by ensuring that HMRs are managed as protected no-take areas.

Antifouling activities of these six compounds were determined against representative fouling organisms including a hard fouling organism the mussel Mytilus edulis, a soft fouling macroalga Ulva pertusa, the biofouling diatom Navicula annexa, and the biofouling bacteria Pseudomonas aeruginosa KNP-3 and Alteromonas sp. KNS-8. The compounds could inhibit larvae settlement of mussel M. edulis with an EC50 of 0.11-3.34 mu g mL(-1), spore settlement of U. pertusa zoospores (EC50 of 0.01-0.43 mu g mL(-1)), and the diatom N. annexa (EC50 of 0.008-0.19 mu g mL(-1)). The two biofouling bacteria were sensitive to the tested compounds (minimum inhibitory concentration of 1.68-36.8 and 1.02-30.4 mu g mL(-1), respectively). From toxicity tests on juvenile Sebastes schlegelii fish, brine shrimp Artemia salina, and microalga Tetraselmis suecica, S3 had the lowest LC50 values of 60.2, 108, and 6.7 mu g mL(-1) and exhibited no observed effect concentration at 24.5, 41.6, and 3.1 mu g mL(-1) for these three tested marine organisms, respectively.",,,,,,,,,32,4,0,0,27,1,35,,,0921-8971,1573-5176,,,,,,,,,,"Soonchunhyang Univ, Dept Marine Biotechnol, Asan 336745, South Korea",,,,2013-02-14,WOS:000313655400032,,

Control efforts via diver spearfishing removals have annually removed tens of thousands of lionfish throughout their invasive range, but the effectiveness of removal efforts to remove 100% or achieve target lionfish densities in a given reef system has not been fully evaluated. Accounting for detection and removal efficacy is necessary for developing and evaluating lionfish management targets, as population- and community-level effects of lionfish removals may be diminished by undetected lionfish remaining in the system. This study quantified lionfish detection, catchability, and removal efficiency to evaluate the effectiveness of lionfish surveys and removal efforts on northern Gulf of Mexico (nGOM) artificial and natural reefs. Detection was assessed during crepuscular and midday time periods via diver and remotely operated vehicle (ROV) video surveys, with covariates for time of day and survey methodology assessed using generalized linear mixed models. Catchability and removal efficiency were estimated via depletion models based on serial removals via spearfishing on 6 artificial reefs and 9 natural reefs. A priori, we had expected lionfish detection to be higher during crepuscular periods given lionfish in the Caribbean and in their native range have been shown to forage more actively away from reefs then. However, we found lionfish detection was not significantly different between midday and crepuscular periods. Survey methodology affected detection, with 24% fewer lionfish being detected via ROV surveys versus diver surveys at artificial reefs and 72% fewer lionfish detected via ROV surveys at natural reefs. Therefore, density estimates on nGOM natural reefs, which constitute of > 99% of the region's habitat, may be higher than previously reported and problematic for lionfish management. Mean catchability for spearfishing lionfish was 0.88 on artificial reefs and 0.69 on natural reefs standardized for area. Mean removal efficiency for the first removal event was 87% on artificial reefs and 67% on natural reefs, higher than removal efficiency computed for Caribbean reefs (47%). Incomplete detection and < 100% removal efficiency, in concert with density-dependent processes, may explain recent findings that sustained lionfish removal efforts had no discernible positive impacts on native reef fish communities.",,,,,,,,,22,0,0,0,19,0,23,,,0165-7836,1872-6763,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Florida, Sch Nat Resources & Environm, Inst Food & Agr Sci, POB 116455,Bldg 0724,103 Black Hall, Gainesville, FL 32611 USAUniv Florida, Fisheries & Aquat Sci, Sch Forest Resources & Conservat, Inst Food & Agr Sci, 7922 NW 71st St, Gainesville, FL 32653 USAUniv Florida, Nat Coast Biol Stn, Inst Food & Agr Sci, 552 1st St,POB 878, Cedar Key, FL 32625 USA",,,,2019-03-22,WOS:000460824700003,,

J,,,,,,,,,,,Flexible Coupled Multi-Body Dynamic Research of Floating Offshore Wind Turbines,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Awarded Grant,Sep 30 2020,2020,"As offshore wind turbines are built further offshore and in deeper waters, it becomes increasingly economically viable to mount the wind turbine on a floating structure that is tethered to the sea floor rather than conventional methods of using a concrete anchor or driven monopoles. Mounting a wind turbine on a floating structure allows for it to be located in much deeper water which comes with the benefits of higher and more consistent wind loads as well as greater public acceptance due to lower visual and environmental impacts that otherwise accompany offshore wind turbines. But they are not without their issues, mounting a tower and a turbine on a floating structure vastly increases the complexity of the system, as it must not only remain buoyant but also limit responses in pitch, roll and heave as well as maintaining position in a large variety of conditions. Excessive responses lead to higher structural stresses and as such would incur higher costs to make the system structurally sound compared to a system with reduced responses, the efficiency of the turbine is also reduced by large rotational responses in pitch and roll which would also add additional wearing onto the turbine components increasing the need for repair and maintenance. As such being able to predict the responses of a floating offshore wind turbine (FOWT) system due to the multiple loads it is put under and reduce them would be required for cost-effective, efficient, and safe designs. The aim of this project is to improve the accuracy of dynamic response prediction of FOWTs and to develop a numerical programme to solve the aero-hydro-elastic-mooring-servo coupled equations of a FOWT. This project is undertaken in partnership between Newcastle University, the ReNU Centre for Doctoral Training, and the Offshore Renewable Energy Catapult. This aero-hydro-elastic-mooring-servo numerical programme will consider the loads from aerodynamics, hydrodynamics, and mooring lines acting on the FOWT in various conditions, this will be coupled with structural and multi-body dynamics in order to predict the response of the FOWT in various sea states. Furthermore, control theory will be applied in order to discern methods of damping and reducing the responses of the FOWT using control systems. It will allow designers to consider different floating body concepts and which concept of floating body would be suitable for the area of operation that the FOWT will be placed in. The programme will be applied for code-to-code comparison with other codes as well as with published basin experimental data or full-scale measured data. It will also be applied in industry practice with a 7MW FOWT with the support of the Offshore Renewable Energy Catapult. This project is funded by the EPSRC Centre for Doctoral Training in Renewable Energy Northeast Universities (ReNU) for funding though grant EP/SO23836/1.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,2448521,,,,,,,,Newcastle University,,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:15412823,,

This work consists in presenting the environmental, social, economic and technological impacts caused by the implementation and operation of the Wind Power Plants in the coast of Ceara through a comparative analysis between the Wind Farms of Beberibe and Fleixeiras I. The main socioenvironmental impacts detected were: fauna and flora, wear and tear of access roads, production of noise, de-characterization of the natural landscape, limitation of the right to come and go, cracks in houses. The economic impacts were more significant during the construction of the parks, gradually decreasing over the years. In the technological aspects, it can be seen that the bigger the height of the towers and the diameter of the rotor, the greater the amount of energy generated. This research had characteristic of descriptive and exploratory research, describing them from the qualitative and quantitative methods. Studies were needed to understand the impacts of the wind energy source, as well as to suggest alternatives to mitigate the worsening global warming caused by the greenhouse effect on the planet.

Since 1974 to 2001, development and improvement projects of fishing grounds include about 20,000 sites in Japan. From 2007, under the direct control of the government, a large-scale construction project began with an objective of providing protective-nursery reefs for snow crabs within a larger goal of managing crab resources. The outline of the projects related to the creation of fishing grounds is as follows:1. The artificial reef construction project targeted mainly fishes. A broad variety of artificial reefs were constructed, from low relief to those over 30 meters tall. Features to enhance the functions as nurseries were added later.2. The addition of nursery features through a nursery works construction project consisted of two types of nurseries. One type was directed toward littoral marine species, developing seaweed beds, and tidal lands in shallow water to serve as nurseries for abalone, clams, lobsters and kelp, etc. The second type was directed toward the creation and development of spawning and rearing grounds for fry and fishes that migrate to other areas. These included sea bream, flatfish, and squids, etc.3.

This work assesses summer fog events contribution to nitrogen deposition and availability for forest ecosystems. Rain and fog samples were collected at Mt Areskutan, Sweden, during CAEsAR (Cloud and Aerosol Characterization Experiment), in 2014. NH4+ + NO3- represent (31 +/- 25) % of total rain ion amount, and (31 +/- 42) % in fog. Based on ion concentrations and the nitrate stable isotope signatures delta(N-15) and delta(O-18), it was possible to detect the plume generated by the Vastmanland forest fire; NOx emissions from oil rigs and Kola Peninsula; and the plume of Bardarbunga volcano, Iceland. Scavenging of ions by fog was more efficient than by rain. Rain NH4+ and NO3- deposition was (26 +/- 36) mu mol m(-2) d(-1) and (23 +/- 27) mu mol m(-2) d(-1), respectively. Fog NH4+ and NO3- contributed (77 +/- 80) % to total wet deposition of these species. Upscaling rain deposition fluxes to 1 year gave an inorganic nitrogen deposition of (18 +/- 16) mmol m(-2) a(-1) ((252 +/- 224) mg m(-2) a(-1) N equivalents), whereas fog deposition was estimated as (59 +/- 47) mmol m(-2) a(-1) ((826 +/- 658) mg m(-2) a(-1) N equivalents). Annual fog deposition was four times higher than previously reported for the area which only considered rain deposition. However, great uncertainty on the calculation of fog deposition need to be bear in mind. These findings suggest that fog should be considered in deposition estimates of inorganic nitrogen and major ions.

Highly complex reef coenoses are affected by mechanical breakage and the coverage of corals by resuspended sediments. As the ecological capacity of the biocoenosis is exceeded, sensitive species are suppressed and the community is impoverished. The conflict between the needs of nature conservation and the economic interests of diving tourism can be mitigated by the creation of artificial underwater attractions as reef substitutes. Specially designed underwater structures are ideal for many diving activities, which can be diverted from sensitive natural habitats in that way. It is also possible to develop model reef communities for training and environmental education purposes. Our new concept is based on the elegant solution, proposed by Hilbertz et al. (1977), of depositing calcium minerals from the seawater in situ by electrolysis. We report on experiments conducted near Aqaba (Red Sea) showing that it is feasible to transplant living coral fragments on to the substrate being developed by electrochemical processes.

As the offshore hydrocarbon industry matures, operators and national governments must decide whether decommissioned pipelines should be left in situ or removed for onshore disposal. In most jurisdictions, there is a requirement to evaluate the environmental consequences of different pipeline decommissioning options in a comparative assessment. To do this effectively requires an understanding of the associations between pipelines and fauna. Pipeline operators routinely collect video footage for inspection and maintenance purposes using remotely operated vehicles (ROV). This footage has the potential to provide insight into interactions between the marine environment and offshore pipelines. This study uses inspection footage from eight pipelines to quantify the presence and abundance of species and features listed under a number of EU and United Kingdom conservation designations; 12 such features and species were observed on the pipelines or neighboring sediments. The soft coral Alcyonium digitatum was present in the highest densities on pipelines located on mud, while Sabellaria sp. and Echinus esculentus were more common on pipelines in sand. Gadoids, anemones and hermit crabs were also frequently observed around pipelines. The study identifies the limitations to the use of industry ROV footage for ecological purposes, but shows that with consideration of taxon size, image resolution, ROV speed and altitude, this can be a valuable approach to gain additional insights into environment-infrastructure interactions. The results suggest that removal of pipelines will remove established colonies of epibenthic species, some of which have conservation value. The ecological significance of this loss, however, must be weighed against the broader considerations during pipeline decommissioning including cost, technical feasibility and impacts to other marine users.",,,,,,,,,14,0,0,0,9,0,14,,,,2296-7745,,,,,,,,,,"Scottish Assoc Marine Sci, Scottish Marine Inst, Oban, Argyll, ScotlandMarine Scotland Sci, Aberdeen, Scotland",,,,2019-05-08,WOS:000465447800001,,

Baited remote underwater video systems equipped with stereo cameras were deployed (n = 348) on 11 habitat types, classified through interpretation of side-scan sonar imagery. In the video samples, 11,801 fish were enumerated. Nonparametric analysis of reef-fish assemblages detected four clusters related to habitat; assemblages associated with geologic habitats were distinct, whereas the remaining three clusters represented groupings of artificial habitats of different size, scale, and complexity. While many species, including Vermilion Snapper Rhomboplites aurorubens and Red Snapper Lutjanus campechanus, were observed in greater numbers on artificial reef habitats, most species were observed in all habitats sampled. Among artificial reef habitats, the habitat cluster consisting of unidentified depressions, unidentified artificial reefs, construction materials, and reef modules was similar to geologic habitats in supporting larger individuals, specifically Gray Triggerfish Balistes capriscus and Red Snapper. In contrast, the habitat cluster consisting of smaller, generally solitary chicken-transport cages was inhabited by smaller individuals, including smaller Red Snapper. Although geologic reefs are the predominant reef habitat throughout much of the eastern Gulf, artificial reefs are important locally, especially in the Florida Panhandle.

To evaluate the ARs capacity to promote marine fish biodiversity in Santa Maria Bay, the fish assemblages were compared to those from nearby natural reefs (NRs), located at the same depth (10 and 28 m depth), by means of visual census. All study sites were surveyed by visual census in August 2009. A total of 64 species were recorded, mostly consisting of sedentary and/or benthophagous demersal species, followed by highly-sedentary benthic cryptic species. 'Tchuklassa' NR showed the highest species richness (58 species), while the lowest was recorded at 'Santo Antao' AR (48 species). An overall positive relationship was observed between habitat rugosity and mean species richness. The results showed a high percentage of common species on both reef types. Higher mean values of community descriptors (number of species, Shannon-Weaver diversity index, Simpson dominance index and equitability) and fish density were found on the ARs, with slightly higher densities recorded on the deeper reefs.

It is being put forward by Cape Wind Associates, a Boston-based firm that wishes to build 170 turbines five miles offshore in Nantucket Sound. The proposed development would supply most of Cape Cod's energy needs and two percent of energy requirements in New England, preventing the need for additional fossil fuel power plants that would pollute the environment and harm the health of New Englanders. The eco-friendly state of Massachusetts has produced much opposition to this project, including resistance from the liberal Senator Ted Kennedy. Criticism of this project ranges from anticipated bird kills by the turbine to concerns about the permitting process, but the most important issue appears to be that of visual pollution. This paper will examine this interesting form of pollution, and how reactionary Not In My Back Yard concerns can shape the debate. The responsibility for producing the environmental impact statement has fallen to the Army Corps of Engineers, the regulatory agency by mandate of the Rivers and Harbors Act of 1899. That legislation did not anticipate a project that would use 28 square miles of public waters for private profit. This has led to concerns that an open season for more developments of this type may begin on the continental shelf and a wind rush will ensue.

Cooling water systems if not properly treated invariably become susceptible to biofouling. The problem is particularly severe in the tropics and is site-, season-, and substratum-specific. Further, cooling systems serve as a source of macrofouling organisms and breeding grounds wherein invertebrate larvae are produced and colonize equipment downstream like pipelines, valves and heat exchangers. Once-through seawater or freshwater systems encounter severe macrofouling-associated problems like flow reduction, increased pressure drop across heat exchangers and equipment breakdown. Biocidal dose and regime for cooling water systems and heat-exchangers have to be tailor-made for a power plant and should be effective in controlling microbial biofouling as well as hard foulants (barnacles, mussels, tubeworms and oysters). With regard to macrofouling control in condenser-cooling systems of power plants, chlorination has been the method of choice for fouling control over the years due to its low cost, easy availability and handling, and known degradation pathways. Increasing awareness on the toxic effects of chlorination by-products and better understanding of the biocidal action, environmental issues and higher dosages required for sanitization of surfaces has resulted in replacement of chlorine by stronger oxidizing biocides like chlorine dioxide. Experimental studies using coastal seawater in plate heat exchangers, has revealed a chlorine residual of 1.0 ppm to prevent settlement of invertebrate larvae. However, an intermittent chlorination dose of 1.2 ppm residuals at a frequency of 0.5-2 h was sufficient in controlling slime formation. Side-stream monitoring of these heat exchangers in a nuclear power plant cooling circuit revealed barnacle fouling in spite of continuous chlorination of 0.2-0.3 ppm residuals and shock doses of 0.4-0.6 ppm twice a week for 8 h. In an operational plant, continuous monitoring of the fouling situation using side-stream monitoring devices is to be practised and the biocidal dose and regime altered to overcome any spikes in settlement. This is essentially because biocidal doses required to kill established fouling communities are far higher than those for inhibiting settlement. Even if killing is achieved, accumulation of dead shell biomass (barnacles and tubeworms) often results in loading on equipment surfaces and increases surface roughness, facilitating settlement of other fouling organisms.",,,,,,,,,7,2,0,0,3,0,9,,,1863-9607,,978-3-540-69796-1; 978-3-540-69794-7,,,,,,,,,"Indira Gandhi Ctr Atom Res Campus, Biofouling & Biofilm Proc Sect, Water & Steam Chem Div, BARC Facil, Kalpakkam 603102, Tamil Nadu, IndiaGovt India, Natl Inst Ocean Technol, Minist Earth Sci, Chennai 600100, Tamil Nadu, India",,,,2009-01-01,WOS:000372003000015,,

The majority of operating wind farm turbines are on land, but it is expected that an important part of the future expansion of wind energy utilization, mainly in Europe, will come from offshore sites, where there are favorable wind conditions compared to sites on land. However, the higher energy yield has to compensate the additional installation and maintenance cost. For this reason, within any off-shore project planning and design process, it is very important to consider appropriately the effect of the electrical configuration, and the maintenance and repair strategy during lifetime. This work presents a methodological framework integrated within an informatic tool to help deciding which is the optimal between combinations of different i) electrical configurations, and ii) maintenance and repair strategies. The work was developed within the project Ocean Lider (www.oceanlider.org). The main objective is to evaluate the maximum potential energy that can be evacuated during lifetime for each combination. Since this problem has a stochastic nature, a number of lifetime simulations is performed. Each simulation has several stages: i) time of failure decision for each electrical component, ii) evaluation, based on graph theory, of generators out of service due to different component failures, iii) estimation of repair times considering available meteorological time windows, and finally iv) the estimation of the maximum energy which can be evacuated at any moment during lifetime. Results from simulations allow analysing the performance of different combinations of electrical configurations versus maintenance and repair strategies, and making informed decisions managing the risks due to uncertainty. This methodological framework would constitute a valuable decision tool for planners and designers.",,,,,IEEE OCEANS ConferenceIEEE OCEANS Conference,"JUN 06-09, 2011JUN 06-09, 2011",IEEEIEEE,"Santander, SPAINSantander, SPAIN",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,0197-7385,,*****************,,,,,,,,,"Univ Cantabria, Environm Hydraul Inst IH Cantabria, E-39005 Santander, Spain",,,,2012-03-21,WOS:000299429000208,,

This article summarizes our experience with a wide range of projects in Hawaii and the U. S. - affiliated Pacific Islands. The terms mitigation and restoration are often taken to mean reef repair, coral transplantation or construction of additional habitat (e.g. artificial reefs). However, other options are available and should be considered. In some situations removal of the anthropogenic factor causing the damage while allowing natural processes of recovery to occur is the best approach. Natural rates of reef recovery can be very rapid In such situations and direct human intervention on the reefs is unnecessary. In some instances a negotiated environmental settlement or financial penalties can be used to establish trust funds to offset environmental losses. Review of past attempts to mitigate reef damage and restore reefs suggests that managers must have a broad strategic plan and incorporate a wide range of approaches designed to fit each situation on a case by case basis. Although protection of the reefs must always be the top priority, there will inevitably be situations where damage will occur. In these situations restoration and mitigation measures will have to be considered.",,,,,Annual Conference of the Marine-Technology-SocietyAnnual Conference of the Marine-Technology-Society,"NOV 05-08, 2001NOV 05-08, 2001","Marine Technol Soc; IEEE; OES; Minerals, Met & Mat Soc; Soc Explorat Geophysicists; Amer Geophys Union; Womens Aquat Network; Coasts, Oceans, Ports & Rivers Inst; Amer Meteorol Soc; Oceanog SocMarine Technol Soc; IEEE; OES; Minerals, Met & Mat Soc; Soc Explorat Geophysicists; Amer Geophys Union; Womens Aquat Network; Coasts, Oceans, Ports & Rivers Inst; Amer Meteorol Soc; Oceanog Soc","HONOLULU, HIHONOLULU, HI",3,0,0,0,3,0,3,,,,,0-933957-28-9,,,,,,,,,"Natl Marine Fisheries Serv, Pacific Isl Area Off, Honolulu, HI 96814 USA",,,,2001-01-01,WOS:000178200800047,,

J,,,,,,,,,,,Fish Spas: the importance of turbulence on stress levels of fish in dynamic environments.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Awarded Grant,Sep 08 2019,2019,"The coastal marine environment is becoming ever more populated by the placement of infrastructure from industries including oil and gas and more recently the renewable energy sector including wind, wave and tidal energy devices. There are currently >4000 offshore wind turbines in Europe that have a monopile for a foundation (87%). For fish, these structures create new habitat, but the structures also change the hydrodynamic environment by introducing wake turbulence downstream of the structure. Fish are known to exploit small scale vortex structures at scales relevant to fish size. However, evidence suggests that fish also exploit wakes at much larger turbulence scales such as in the lee of a marine renewable device where vortex scales are significantly larger than fish length. These results suggest that fish respond as a direct result of physical changes in the environment at a range of scales. What is less clear is how changes in hydrodynamics translates to the physiological response in fish, primarily the stress response. Hydrodynamics is a fundamental process in the marine environment and there is little information of how changes in flow environments (current speed or oscillatory flow) and associated changes in turbulence influence physiological processes of fish. The question therefore arises, does turbulence act as a fish 'spa'? The hypothesis is that turbulence diffuses the forces associated with flow velocity to act as a refuge behind marine renewable structures, especially in high flow environments allowing fish to exploit these environments. With the future addition of thousands of new structures into the marine environment, it is essential that the mechanism behind behavior changes is fully understood. Therefore, the aim of this project seeks to understand the importance of hydrodynamics on the stress response of marine fish using both controlled laboratory experimental and field based approaches.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,2280714,,,,,,,,Queen's University of Belfast,,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:15319396,,

Density, diversity and average trophic level did not show this sensitivity.

Conversely, the main fishery target species (hake, anglerfish and megrim) showed a progressive decrease in abundance during the study period, a pattern which was also shown by their total stock biomass in the totality of the shelf area. Sea urchins, cephalopods and gastropods also increased in relative abundance with trawl exclusion. Reef age was identified as a key factor in reef development. After reef deployments, two periods were identified: (1) a recovery period, in which total biomass increased, mainly as a consequence of the increase in generalist species (e. g. catsharks); and (2) a consolidation period, during which biomass increased again, mainly as a consequence of an increase in specialized stenoic species (e. g. sparids), while biomass of generalist species remained constant or declined.",,,,,,,,,10,1,0,0,8,0,10,,,0025-3154,,,,,,,,,,,"Inst Espanol Oceanog, Lab Santander, Santander 39004, Spain",,,,2011-04-30,WOS:000289439900006,,

In coastal areas, growing populations are advancing their urban footprint into the ocean through the construction of seawalls and other built infrastructure. While we have some understanding of how urbanisation might drive functional change in terrestrial ecosystems, coastal systems have been largely overlooked. This study is one of the first to directly assess how changes in diversity relate to changes in ecosystem properties and functions (e.g. productivity, filtration rates) of artificial and natural habitats in one of the largest urbanised estuaries in the world, Sydney Harbour. We complemented our surveys with an extensive literature search. We found large and important differences in the community structure and function between artificial and natural coastal habitats. However, differences in diversity and abundance of organisms do not necessarily match observed functional changes. The abundance and composition of important functional groups differed among habitats with rocky shores having 40% and 70% more grazers than seawalls or pilings, respectively. In contrast, scavengers were approximately 8 times more abundant on seawalls than on pilings or rocky shores and algae were more diverse on natural rocky shores and seawalls than on pilings. Our results confirm previous findings in the literature. Oysters were more abundant on pilings than on rocky shores, but were also smaller. Interestingly, these differences in oyster populations did not affect in situ filtration rates between habitats. Seawalls were the most invaded habitats while pilings supported greater secondary productivity than other habitats. This study highlights the complexity of the diversity-function relationship and responses to ocean sprawl in coastal systems. Importantly, we showed that functional properties should be considered independently from structural change if we are to design and manage artificial habitats in ways to maximise the services provided by urban coastal systems and minimise their ecological impacts.",,,,,,,,,65,0,0,0,52,0,65,,,1748-9326,,,,,,,,,,,"Univ New South Wales, Sch Biol Earth & Environm Sci, Evolut & Ecol Res Ctr, Sydney, NSW, AustraliaSydney Inst Marine Sci, Mosman, NSW 2088, AustraliaUniv Sydney, Life & Environm Sci, Sydney, NSW 2006, AustraliaPort Stephens Fisheries Inst, NSW Dept Primary Ind, Taylors Beach, NSW, AustraliaPlymouth Univ, Sch Marine Sci & Engn, Plymouth PL4 8AA, Devon, EnglandUniv Bologna, UO CoNISMa, Dipartimento Sci Biol Geol & Ambien, Bologna, ItalyUniv Bologna, UO CoNISMa, Ctr Interdipartimentale Ric Sci Ambientali, Bologna, Italy",,,,2018-01-01,WOS:000419385900002,,

The artificial reef system consists of a protection reef and an exploitation reef. As part of this project, a fishing survey was carried out over four and a half years, using gill nets. To test artificial reef effectiveness in enhancing fish assemblages and yield, a total of 72 catch operations were made. The fishing yields (weight) from the reefs exceeded those from the control sites, by 2.03 times for the protection reef, and by 1.11 times for the exploitation reef. Artificial reef deployment resulted in an enrichment and diversification of the local fish community, with an increase in the total species richness, mean species richness and the species diversity indices. Since the artificial reefs improved the local fishing yields and made possible a better use of the Ria Formosa 'nursery potential', the reefs appear to represent a useful management tool on the Algarve coast, contributing to the improved value of the artisanal fishery, which has a very important role in this region.

Nowadays, most of the reefs are located off the Mediterranean coast; new projects are being developed on the Atlantic side (e.g. Yeu Island or Cap Breton, etc.), the English Channel (Le Treport), and the overseas' islands of Reunion and Martinique.Thus, approximately 40 reef sets have been submerged in French marine waters; some of them are the result of several releases (e.g., Gruissan, Marine Park of the Blue Coast (Charbonnel et al. 2000)). These projects are most often created at the request of fishermen working close to the coasts. The development of the artificial reef was initially connected to development and support for inshore fishing (creation of the site in 1968 in Palavas, unpublished Lacroix D.).

Ecological studies were also conducted pre- and post-1997-1998 El Nino and qualitatively from 1994 to 1999 at the Mission Beach Artificial Reef. El Nino events have been associated with catastrophic ecological conditions in the southern California nearshore zone that may have significant influence on both reef structure and reef community. The variation of kelp populations in the three natural kelp beds is reviewed relative to recent El Nino events, local wave climate, local sea surface temperatures, and regional precipitation. The local temperature and precipitation data show that El Nino periods have had varying and non-consistent effects with respect to kelp growth. Yet, periods of low kelp density appear to be related to extended periods of above normal sea surface temperatures and increased precipitation generally associated with El Nino events. Examination of artificial reef data from the standpoint of substrate and kelp persistence through the latest 1997-1998 El Nino event revealed effects that are consistent with natural kelp bed information. The population dynamics of natural kelp beds through various El Nino periods indicate that the range of kelp density fluctuations over time on an artificial reef designed for kelp can be expected to be quite high.",,,,,7th International Conference on Artificial Reefs and related Aquatic Habitats7th International Conference on Artificial Reefs and related Aquatic Habitats,"OCT 07-11, 1999OCT 07-11, 1999",ICES; Italian Soc Marine Biol; European Artificial Reef Res Network; Sanremo Congressi Turismo; Univ Geona; Phillips Petr; European Commiss; US Natl Marine Fisheries ServICES; Italian Soc Marine Biol; European Artificial Reef Res Network; Sanremo Congressi Turismo; Univ Geona; Phillips Petr; European Commiss; US Natl Marine Fisheries Serv,"SAN REMO, ITALYSAN REMO, ITALY",15,0,0,0,12,1,16,,,1054-3139,,,,,,,,,,,"So Calif Edison Co, Rosemead, CA 91770 USAEcoSyst Management Associates Inc, Carlsbad, CA 92009 USAOcean Imaging, Solona Beach, CA 92075 USA",So Calif Edison CoEcoSyst Management Associates IncOcean Imaging,,,2002-10-01,WOS:000179243500052,,

This study examined the infaunal communities around two non-fishery artificial reefs (the sunken vessels YO257 and Sea Tiger) in Mamala Bay, Hawaii. Infaunal community structures at these artificial reefs were relatively similar to one at a nearly natural patch reef. A large amount of basalt gravel around YO257 associated with its deployment operation possibly had an effect on the surrounding community by increasing pore space. Polychaete assemblages were compared with existing data throughout the bay, and this revealed that the variation in sediment grain sizes and depths seemed to play some role in structuring the polychaete communities. Nevertheless, the infaunal communities around the artificial reefs were typical and within the range of natural variation in Mamala Bay, supporting their beneficial uses in ecotourism.

Hard bottom is much less extensive than fine sediments on most continental shelves but supports epifauna/flora as cover for reef fish and serves as habitat for their prey species. Corals, epifauna, and macroflora on natural reefs function as feeding, shelter, and aggregation sites and often have fractal characteristics. Size frequencies of catches from unfished banks may reflect the aggregate of crevice size spectra present, and this influences growth and natural mortality rates at size. It is suggested that migration is initiated when juvenile fish outgrow cover in nursery areas, which only offered predator protection at smaller sizes. Juveniles are then forced to move further offshore where cover for protecting larger reef fishes is often more available. Large cavities are rare on most natural outcrops or reefs, but these attract large fish and artificial reefs are often designed to have large cavities needed by mature reef fishes. Once artificial reefs are located by fishermen, large, resident fishes are readily captured.

While the underlying mechanisms remain widely debated, production was recently determined as the most probable cause of increases in fish biomass. Changes in fish biomass in a temperate AR system were investigated from December 2008 to November 2015 by considering seven distinct functional groups, and isotopic functional indices were used to identify how these changes may have affected organic matter (OM) fluxes. Contrasting patterns of change were observed between functional trophic groups, highlighting that combining the biomass of all species present in a community is inappropriate for assessing AR-induced effects. Benthic sedentary species pre-dominated (> 75% of the total biomass) through massive production, with a 68-fold increase in mean biomass over the study period. Mobile species tended to vary seasonally, suggesting only a slight influence of AR. Zooplanktivores biomass decreased over the 6-year period, as a possible result of changes in environmental conditions. Isotopic indices helped to reveal both the community maturation and the importance of local OM sources not only in supporting fish biomass production but also in attracting pelagic species. Our results corroborate that production and attraction are two extremes of a range of contrasting patterns and highlight the importance of considering the specific responses of functional components of fish communities to accurately describe changes in AR functioning.

For this purpose, a process model is used to integrate all aspects of these complex and safety-critical operations which involve many different actors, resources, and environmental conditions.

Consequently, habitats are being lost and replaced by other, artificial habitats, or are being severely modified in deleterious ways. Management of these changes requires recognition of the types of changes that are being made to estuarine shorelines, what sorts of impacts they cause and what sorts of managerial intervention are possible or desirable. Because experimentation in these managed habitats is in its early stages, it is important to provide sound ecological advice based on realistic hypotheses about consequent ecological changes. Wherever possible, management should be evaluated by well-planned experiments, involving analyses of changes in managed areas compared with changes in appropriate control areas. Where the goals of managerial action are the recovery of assemblages of species, what happens in managed areas should also be compared by equivalence tests with what happens in reference areas or relative to pre-defined ecological measures of what would constitute recovery. Here, different types of altered habitats, impacts, ecological changes and purposes of management are discussed. The needs for and nature of different types of hypotheses, experiments and analyses are reviewed with reference to relevant examples. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Here we evaluate the hypothesis that the abundance and spatial distribution of an epibenthic mobile organism, the squat lobster Munida gregaria (=M. subrugosa), is influenced by predation by fishes that shelter in temperate rocky reefs of northern Patagonia. The density of squat lobsters on sandy bottoms around three reefs, one natural and two artificial, was estimated at increasing distances (0, 5, 15 and 45 in) from the reefs. In one of the artificial reefs a sample was first collected four months after the reef was created, before it was colonized by fish, and again nine months later when a population of reef-dwelling fish had been established. An area between 5 and 19 in wide free of squat lobsters surrounded all colonized reefs, and no effect was evident at a distance of 45 in from the reefs. In contrast, the density of squat lobsters did not vary with distance from the reef in the new, uncolonized, artificial reef. A predation exclusion experiment conducted around both artificial reefs resulted in a larger presence of squat lobsters within exclusion cages than in partial and open cages. The caging experiment provides strong evidence for attributing the halo around the reefs to predation by fishes, and to confirm that off-reef foraging behaviour depletes prey abundance in nearby soft bottoms.

We used fishery-independent vertical line surveys to evaluate whether gear efficiency and selectivity is similar while assessing reef fish populations at oil and gas platforms, artificial reefs, and natural banks in the western Gulf of Mexico. We conducted 192 vertical line sets with cameras placed on a subset of these deployments to validate any differences in efficiency among habitat types. Red snapper (Lutjanus campechanus) accounted for 93% of the catch. No difference in red snapper CPUE among habitats was detected. When evaluating fish size, 8/0 and 11/0 hooks sampled significantly larger red snapper at natural banks than at artificial habitats. While CPUE was similar among all hooks at artificial habitats, CPUE at natural banks was lower for shallower hooks and increased towards the bottom hooks along the backbone. At all habitats, red snapper TL decreased from shallow to deep hook positions. Simultaneous camera deployments revealed other processes affecting efficiency such as bait removal and depredation. Vermilion snapper (Rhomboplites aurorubens) were effective at removing bait while avoiding capture. Perhaps related to this observation, Red snapper CPUE was negatively correlated with the vermilion snapper video index of abundance. Video confirmed gear saturation was prevalent (70% of deployments), occurring more frequently on artificial habitats. Furthermore, the time fished was effectively shorter at artificial habitats as the number of available baited hooks declined rapidly. These results point towards higher relative abundance at artificial habitats; however, the prevalence of saturation indicates vertical line CPUE may not always be proportional to true abundance, hindering our ability to detect differences at the scale examined in this study. Vertical line surveys should evaluate the prevalence of saturation as inferences regarding relative abundance may be compromised when this information is unknown.",,,,,,,,,16,1,0,0,15,0,17,,,0165-7836,1872-6763,,,,,,,,,,"Texas A&M Univ Corpus Christi, Harte Res Inst Gulf Mexico Studies, 6300 Ocean Dr,Unit 5869, Corpus Christi, TX 78412 USAFlorida Atlantic Univ, Harbor Branch Oceanog Inst, 5600 US 1 North, Ft Pierce, FL 34946 USA",,,,2018-12-28,WOS:000432768000003,,

Over the course of their decades-long life-spans, these platforms become ecologically important artificial reefs, supporting a variety of marine life. When offshore platforms are no longer active they are decommissioned, which usually requires the removal of the entire platform from the marine environment, destroying the artificial reef that has been created and potentially resulting in the loss of important ecosystem services. While some countries allow for these platforms to be converted into artificial reefs under Rigs-to-Reefs programs, they face significant resistance from various stakeholders. The presence of offshore platforms and the associated marine life alters the ecosystem from that which existed prior to the installation of the platform, and there may be factors which make restoration of the ecosystem unfeasible or even detrimental to the environment. In these cases, a novel ecosystem has emerged with potentially significant ecological value. In restoration ecology, ecosystems altered in this way can be classified and managed using the novel ecosystems concept, which recognizes the value of the new ecosystem functions and services and allows for the ecosystem to be managed in its novel state, instead of being restored. Offshore platforms can be assessed under the novel ecosystems concept using existing decommissioning decision analysis models as a base. With thousands of platforms to be decommissioned around the world in coming decades, the novel ecosystems concept provides a mechanism for recognizing the ecological role played by offshore platforms.",,,,,,,,,40,0,0,0,25,0,42,,,,2296-7745,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Western Australia, Sch Biol Sci, Crawley, WA, Australia",,,,2019-09-16,WOS:000483814800001,,

The research efforts will be anchored by the University of Massachusetts Lowell as the lead institution, partnering with Texas A&M, the University of Texas at Dallas, and Iowa State University. Wind energy systems for electricity production are complex engineered systems that operate on land or over water to produce usable power. These systems consist of an array of wind turbines placed on appropriate support structures and interconnected to deliver electric power to the utility grid. The potential for land-based and offshore wind energy is tremendous, but to achieve this potential will require a coherent and industry-relevant research and development program that involves industry, academe and government. The proposed I/UCRC will address industrially relevant research to advance and support the development of wind energy systems with low-cost energy and high reliability. The partners intend to engage in a cooperative program of research and education in the following areas: A) Composites in Wind Energy, B) Foundations and Towers, C) Manufacturing and Design, D) Structural Health Monitoring, Non-Destructive Inspection, and Testing,E) Control Systems and Storage, and F) Wind System Planning, Siting, Operations, and Maintenance. The proposed center will provide a forum in which wind turbine manufacturers, manufacturers of key components, suppliers of ancillary equipment, service companies, and wind project developers can work together to solve problems that are of mutual interest. In addition, the center will work to develop and integrate educational activities that enhance recruitment and retention of diverse student populations. The Center intends to collaborate with KidWind, which provides teaching materials for K-12 teachers, and manages regional and national challenges for team turbine design competitions. The center will provide a conduit for the transfer of ideas among KidWind, industry, and academe and will engage industrial partners to develop regional training programs between educators and industry to create a sustainable pipeline of future STEM workers with strong interest by women and underrepresented groups.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,1238302,,,,,,,,University of Texas at Dallas,,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:13608267,,

Previous research indicates that little nutrition is derived directly from artificial reefs; rather the majority of prey comes from surrounding soft bottom habitat. The goal of this study was to determine if there are differences in the feeding ecology of red snapper between standing oil and gas platforms, toppled platforms designated as artificial reefs, and natural reefs on the continental shelf edge, using a combination of gut content and stable isotope analyses. Results indicate that fish dominated diets at all three sites, but that differences exist in the contribution of major prey items by percentage dry weight among habitats. Red snapper collected from standing platforms consumed primarily fish, squid, and shrimp, while greater amounts of crabs, shrimp, and other crustaceans were consumed at toppled platforms. On the natural reefs, diets varied the most, consisting of both fish and crustaceans. Stable isotope analyses suggest fish collected over the standing platforms are more enriched in delta(15) N, indicating feeding at a higher trophic level than the other habitats.

One example of this includes ?active fluid? systems. In such systems there are active organisms which are influenced by the flow of fluid around them but, crucially, also influence the flow. When the organisms are anisotropic (as is often the case) a model of such a system must include these factors, and models of bacteria and even larger organisms such as fish have started to be developed over the last few years in order to examine the order, self-organisation and pattern formation within these systems. This proposal aims to use techniques from the theoretical modelling of liquid crystal systems to consider a number of different areas of the natural world and to consider the effect of anisotropy on the behaviour of important marine bacteria and larger organisations of fish.

Despite being a hotspot for introduction due to numerous shipping routes converging at the Strait of Gibraltar, knowledge of marine exotics in the Iberian Peninsula is scarce, especially of abundant but small-sized and taxonomically challenging taxa such as the Order Isopoda. To fill this gap, we conducted several sampling surveys in 44 marinas and provide the first comprehensive study of marine exotic isopods from the Iberian Peninsula, the southern side of the Strait of Gibraltar (northern Africa) and the Balearic Islands. Exotic species included Ianiropsis serricaudis (first record for the Iberian Peninsula and Lusitanian marine province), Paracerceis sculpta (first record for the Alboran Sea ecoregion), Paradella dianae, Paranthura japonica (earliest record for the Iberian Peninsula) and Sphaeroma walkeri. Photographs with morphological details for identification for non-taxonomic experts are provided, their worldwide distribution is updated and patterns of invasion are discussed. We report an expansion in the distribution range of all species, especially at the Strait of Gibraltar and nearby areas. Ianiropsis serricaudis and Paranthura japonica are polyvectic, with shellfish trade and recreational boating being most probable vectors for their introduction and secondary spread. The subsequent finding of the studied species in additional marinas over the years points at recreational boating as a vector and indicates a future spread. We call for attention to reduce lags in the detection and reporting of small-size exotics, which usually remain overlooked or underestimated until the invasion process is at an advanced stage.",,,,,,,,,19,0,0,0,17,0,20,,,2167-8359,,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Seville, Labo Biol Marina, Dept Zool, Fac Biol, Seville, SpainCASEM, Fac Ciencias Mary & Ambientales, Dept Biol, Campus Univ Puerto Real, Cadiz, Spain",,,,2018-02-27,WOS:000426521400004,29507825,

Offshore wind energy sector has been clearly the fastest in its development among other options, and development of new wind farms requires large ocean space. Therefore, there is a need of efficient spatial planning process, including the site selection constrained by technical (wind resource, coastal distance, seafloor) and environmental (impacts) factors and competence of uses. We present a novel approach, using Bayesian Belief Networks (BBN), for an integrated spatially explicit site feasibility identification for offshore wind farms. Our objectives are to: (i) develop a spatially explicit model that integrates the technical, economic, environmental and social dimensions; (ii) operationalize the BBN model; (iii) implement the model at local (Basque Country) and regional (North East Atlantic and Western Mediterranean), and (iv) develop and analyse future scenarios for wind farm installation in a local case study. Results demonstrated a total of 1% (23 km(2)) of moderate feasibility areas in local scaled analysis, compared to 4% of (21,600 km(2)) very high, and 5% (30,000 km(2)) of high feasibility in larger scale analysis. The main challenges were data availability and discretization when trying to expand the model from local to regional level. The use of BBN models to determine the feasibility of offshore wind farm areas has been demonstrated adequate and possible, both at local and regional scales, allowing managers to take management decisions regarding marine spatial planning when including different activities, environmental problems and technological constraints.

However, most of this testing was to measure hammer performance and pile stresses rather than pile capacity or soil resistance. As the need for more economical solutions for foundation support increases, the use of DMS has provided a better means of evaluating in-place pile capacity for offshore structures, and therefore a method of determining pile acceptance. The authors have been involved in several offshore projects where DMS has been the primary source of data for acceptance of the driven pile foundations.The use of DMS for evaluation of offshore foundations requires considerations quite different from land applications. Specifically, analysis of the collected data for both stress control and pile capacity estimates need to be provided either during driving or shortly after driving completion for pile acceptance. In offshore pile driving, piles are accepted within several hours after driving and construction proceeds so there is no opportunity for further analysis, testing, or driving. In addition, Case Method capacity estimates are often of little use due to the non-uniform cross sections of the foundation piles and their deep penetrations. Therefore, capacity assessments should be made using CAPWAP, whose utility and reliability has been proven on thousands of projects, both on land and offshore. Depending upon the soil conditions at a given location, capacity assessment after soil setup effects may be necessary. In addition, tension capacity is often critical when pile refusal occurs significantly before the design pile penetration depth. Evaluation of uplift capacity can be accomplished by a CAPWAP analysis, which provides the soil resistance distribution along the pile shaft and toe. Finally, the use of hydraulic hammers for driving of these piles also adds the requirement of controlling hammer energy such that over-stressing and buckling of the pile is avoided. The calculation of non-axial stresses such as bending or eccentric stresses may also be involved in order to prevent pile damage.Four examples of platform installations where DMS testing was preformed are presented. The testing results are compared with the expected or calculated pile capacities from the static pile capacity calculations. Discussion of the hammer energy setting and resultant pile stresses are also provided. The advantages provided from the DMS testing are discussed for each platform installation. Based upon these four examples the use of DMS testing to evaluate offshore piles and provide significant cost savings to the project is clearly shown. At three of the four platform locations the final pile penetrations are substantially shorter than that which was expected based upon the static pile capacity calculations. In addition, proper control of the hammer energy was maintained such that buckling of the piles Would not occur during driving.",,,,,8th International Conference on the Application of Stress-Wave Theory to Piles8th International Conference on the Application of Stress-Wave Theory to Piles,"SEP 08-10, 2008SEP 08-10, 2008",Inst Superior Tecn; Int Soc Soil Mech; Geotech Engn ISSMGE TC18Inst Superior Tecn; Int Soc Soil Mech; Geotech Engn ISSMGE TC18,"Lisbon, PORTUGALLisbon, PORTUGAL",1,0,0,0,0,0,1,,,,,978-1-58603-909-7,,,,,,,,,"GRL Engineers Inc, Charlotte, NC USA",GRL Engineers Inc,,,2008-01-01,WOS:000273118700090,,

In contrast, environmental externalities are often the cause of strong opposition to RE adoption if local communities are involved as stakeholders in wind, solar, or biomass investment projects. Looking at the literature on willingness to pay and on willingness to accept, we have investigated RE acceptance mechanisms. In this chapter, we use a meta-analysis to assess the major determinants of RE acceptance on both the demand and supply sides. This meta-analysis has provided some insights that are useful for managing field research on an onshore wind farm enlargement project located in the Umbria region of Italy. The meta-analysis and survey results confirm that the local community plays a central role in local RE acceptance. Furthermore, people who have previous experience of windmills require less compensation, or are willing to pay more, for RE development. The results suggest that these attributes should be included in future research to improve understanding of determinants of RE acceptance.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,2191-5547,2191-5555,978-94-024-1574-2; 978-94-024-1572-8,,,,,,,,,"Univ Perugia, Perugia, Italy",,,,2019-01-01,WOS:000717148900002,,

The course was 370 m long and had 19.4 m of vertical ascent and descent using the stairs on simulated offshore structures. Inspired ventilation and oxygen consumption were measured using the P. K. Morgan 'Oxylog' and subjects breathed through the apparatus by mouthpiece and one-way valve assembly while wearing a nose clip. On comparison with anthropometric data from larger studies, this sample of the offshore work-force was thought to be representative. The mean duration of the exercise period was 371 s (SD = 24 s, range = 325-424 s). Mean oxygen consumption standing still at the start of the trial was 0.421 min(-1) (SD = 0.101 min(-1), max. = 0.611 min(-1)) and mean ventilation 12.351 min(-1) (SD = 4.251 min(-1), max. = 22.271 min(-1)). During exercise, the mean oxygen consumption rose to 2.711 min(-1) (SD = 0.641 min(-1), max = 4.051 min(-1)) and mean ventilation reached 46.341 min(-1) (SD = 15.831 min(-1), max = 87.361 min(-1)) during the fifth minute of exercise. At the end of the exercise period, oxygen consumption returned to resting values after 2 min and ventilation after 3 min. There was no indication of an oxygen debt. Oxygen consumption and ventilation were related to body weight and the maximum figures for ventilation and oxygen consumption were seen in individuals of over the 95th centile for weight who completed the exercise more quickly than other subjects. Draft standards for respiratory protective equipment for use during escape from fire do not specify the breathing volumes identified in this study, and which are considerably higher than those being currently considered. Additionally, the atmospheric conditions near a fire are likely to stimulate ventilation to considerably higher levels than those identified here. Accordingly, such equipment is likely to limit physical performance if a similar intensity of exercise is necessary during an escape. The architecture of offshore installations and protocols for escape from them should be structured to minimize exercise, and stair climbing should be avoided if emergency respirators are to be used. Workers should be trained in the use of escape breathing equipment and instruction should include information regarding its limitations and the need to limit exercise to an appropriate level.",,,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,,,0014-0139,,,,,,,,,,,"INST OCCUPAT MED,EDINBURGH EH8 9SV,MIDLOTHIAN,SCOTLAND",INST OCCUPAT MED,,,1997-03-01,WOS:A1997WQ12300003,9118935,

To reduce these negative impacts on wildlife, forecasts of high migration intensities are needed to apply mitigation actions. While existing weather radar networks offer a unique possibility to monitor and forecast bird migration at large spatial scales, forecasts at the fine spatial scale within a complex terrain, such as the mountainous Swiss landscape, require a small-scale network of ornithological radars. Before attempting to build such a network, it is crucial to first investigate the consistency of the migratory flow across space and time. In this study, we simultaneously operated three ornithological radar systems across the Swiss lowlands to assess the spatio-temporal consistency of diurnal and nocturnal bird movements during the spring and autumn migration season. The relative temporal course of migration intensities was generally consistent between sites during peak migration, in particular for nocturnal movements in autumn, but absolute intensities differed greatly between sites. Outside peak migration, bird movement patterns were much less consistent and, unexpectedly, some presumably non-migratory bird activity achieved intensities close to peak migration intensities, but without spatial correlations. Only nocturnal migration intensity in autumn could be predicted with consistently high accuracy, but including parameters of atmospheric conditions in the model improved predictability of diurnal movements considerably. Predictions for spring were less reliable, probably because we missed an important part of the migration season. Our results show that reliable forecasts of bird movements within a complex terrain call for a network of year-round bird monitoring systems, whereas accurate information of atmospheric conditions can help to limit the number of measurement points.",,,,,,,,,4,0,0,0,1,0,4,,,,2056-3485,,,,,,,,,,"Swiss Ornithol Inst, Seerose 1, CH-6204 Sempach, SwitzerlandSwiss Fed Inst Technol, Dept Environm Syst Sci, Inst Terr Ecosyst, Landscape Ecol, Zurich, SwitzerlandSwiss Fed Res Inst WSL, Birmensdorf, SwitzerlandUniv Freiburg, Chair Wildlife Ecol & Management, Freiburg, Germany",,,,2020-01-06,WOS:000504289400001,,

In this study we test the potential of biofiltration by artificial reefs for reducing the negative environmental impacts surrounding fish farms in the Gulf of Aqaba, Red Sea. Two triangular-shaped artificial reefs (reef volume 8.2 m(3)) constructed from porous durable polyethylene were deployed at 20 m; one below a commercial fish farm and the other 500 m west of this farm in order to monitor the colonization of these reefs by the local fauna and to determine whether the reef community can remove fish farm effluents from the water. Both reefs became rapidly colonized by a wide variety of organisms with potential for the removal of compounds released from the farms.

Moreover, numerous benthic algae; small sessile invertebrates (bryozoa, tunicates, bivalves, polychaetes, sponges, anemones) and large motile macrofauna (crustaceans, sea urchins, gastropods) settled on the reef surfaces. Depletion of chlorophyll a was measured in the water traversing the artificial reefs in order to assess the biofiltration capacity of the associated fauna.

Korea will mitigate its greenhouse gas emissions by 25.7% compared to BAU 2030, and will reduce its emissions by a further 11.3% by purchasing external certified emission reductions.But renewable energy production in Korea accounts for only about an insufficient 3% of the total energy production. Moreover, wind power accounts for a meager 2.2% of that ratio as well.For this reason, the current policy for supplying energy through wind power can be deemed to be lacking. The two policies of FIT(feed-in-tariff) and RPS(renewable portfolio standard) need to be appropriately “mixed”: RPS as it is currently stipulated in the “Act on the Promotion of the Development, Use and Diffusion of New and Renewable Energy” should be applied to large-scale projects, while FIT should be available to residents to encourage their participation.For the facilitation of wind power, this article suggests four improvements to be conducted: First, it is necessary to provide certification processes for wind power plants and technology development.Second, it is necessary to evolve from a government-led renewable energy policy system to one that allows the cooperation of local governments and citizens. For this purpose, it is necessary to establish a sustainable energy supply system centered around the local governments that is suitable for the development, supply and consumption of renewable energy according to the needs of the local community.Third, measures to increase the people's acceptance of renewable energy are needed to be put into place. Acceptance can be gained by reorganizing the relevant laws and regulations.Fourth, in the case of offshore wind farms, evolution into a structure that can support the fishing community can be achieved by amending the “Act on Assistance to Electric Power Plants-Neighboring Areas” to allow support to those living on land or an island in a 5 km radius from generators.",,,,"우리나라는 6월 30일에 유엔기후변화협약(UNFCCC)에 INDC(온실가스 자발적 감축목표)를 제출했다. 2030년 BAU 대비 25.7% 감축안을 기본으로 하고, 나머지 11.3%는 외부 탄소배출권을 사서 온실가스를 추가로 감축하기로 하였다.이렇게 온실가스를 감축하기 위해서는 신․재생에너지를 이용하여 에너지를 생산하는 것도 하나의 방법이다. 하지만 한국은 전체 에너지 생산량의 약 3%만을 신․재생에너지를 이용하여 에너지를 생산하고 있다. 그 중에서 풍력에너지가 차지하는 비율은 신․재생에너지 생산량의 약 2.2%로서 아주 미미하다.이 논문에서는 다른 선진국과는 달리 한국에서 풍력을 이용하여 에너지를 생산하는 비율이 왜 낮은지 풍력에너지 생산과 관련된 법률과 정책에 대해 분석해 보았다. 그리고 다른 재생에너지 생산과 달리 풍력발전을 저해하는 물리적인 요인에 대해서도 알아보았다. 또한 정부의 제6차 전력수급 기본계획에 따르면 2020년까지 육상과 해상에서 17GW의 풍력발전단지를 건설할 계획이지만 주민들의 반발로 계획에 차질이 빚어지고 있다. 어떤 이유로 주민들과 갈등을 빚고 있는지 원인을 분석하였다.위와 같은 다양한 분석을 통하여 정책적 측면에서는 정부가 달성하고자 하는 재생에너지 목표를 위해서는 공급의무화정책(RPS)을 적용하고 많은 국민들이 참여할 수 있도록 발전차액지원제도(FIT)도 병행해야 한다. 그리고 풍력발전기 및 설비와 관련하여서는 풍력설비 인증 획득의 통합방안 및 기술개발을 위한 국제 공동연구 방안이 필요하다. 또한 풍력발전단지가 조성됨으로서 주민들의 생활환경에 영향을 주고 있는데 이를 완화시키기 위한 이격거리 및 소음기준이 필요하고 저주파 문제도 같이 연구되어야 한다. 무엇보다 풍력발전단지 주변 주민들의 수용성을 높이는 방안이 필요하다. 예를 들어 법률과 조례의 정비, 풍력발전을 통한 이익을 공유하는 방안, 절차적 참여를 보장하는 방안, 주민참여율에 따라 공급인증서에 가중치를 도입하는 방안, 해상풍력발전단지의 경우에는 「발전소주변지역 지원에 관한 법률」의 개정을 통해 발전기로부터 5km 이상의 육지나 섬에서도 지원을 받을 수 있도록 법을 개정하여 어민들을 지원을 할 수 있는 구조로 변경하여야 한다. 이런 것들이 반영된다면 풍력발전의 활성화를 기대할 수 있으리라 본다.",,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,1976-3743,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2015-10-29,KJD:ART002039922,,

However, although biofouling may cause significant problems related to human health, environmental impact and financial losses, in the past decade there has been an increasing interest in developing methods to promote the growth of biofouling on artificial structures as a strategy to mitigate human impacts and reduce the organic enrichment caused by net-cage fish farming. Here we investigated the filtration activity of biofouling assemblages colonizing artificial substrata located within a harbor. The main objective of the study was to determine if and how changes in composition and functioning of biofouling may be affected by hypoxic conditions that periodically occur within the port site selected for this study. To this purpose, artificial panels were used as biofouling collectors and were brought back to the laboratory seasonally where they were divided in 3 subgroups and acclimated at 3 different oxygen levels to mimic the naturally occurring oxygenic conditions. Clearance and respiration rates of each community were measured 6 and 24 h after the beginning of each treatment. Regardless of experimental conditions, performance of the communities was affected by the seasonality and the amount of biomass recruiting on the panels, mainly composed of crustaceans, ascidians, polychaetes, seaweeds and several introduced species. Our study demonstrated that, in particular cases, fouling assemblages linked to aquaculture facilities may contribute to reducing environmental impact and at the same time may serve as input for their re-use in different disciplines.",,,,,,,,,10,0,0,0,7,0,11,,,1869-215X,1869-7534,,,,,,,,,,"CNR, IAS, Inst Study Anthropogen Impacts & Sustainabil Mari, Via G da Verrazzano 17, I-91014 Castellammare Del Golfo, TP, ItalySede Interdipartimentale Sicilia, Dipartimento Ecol Marina Integrata, Stn Zool Anton Dohrn, Complesso Roosevelt, I-90142 Palermo, ItalyUniv Palermo, Dipartimento Sci Terra & Mare, Viale Sci Ed 16, I-90128 Palermo, Italy",,,,2020-03-06,WOS:000515118800001,,

A nearby assemblage of US Marine floating bridge boxes (Caissons) sunk during WWII and a natural fringing reef (Ricaudy) were surveyed at the same time. Species richness on the Caledonie Toho 2 increased to reach 42 species 398 days after scuttling. Fish density increased for 109 days after scuttling to reach a mean of 8.15 fish/m2, with exceptional peaks during recruitment phases. Fish biomass increased in two steps to reach an average of 336 g/m2 193 days after scuttling. The number of common species was higher between the Caledonie Toho 2 and the Caissons (54 species) than Caledonie Toho 2 and Ricaudy (20 species). Ricaudy fish assemblages were characterized by species associated with live corals whereas the artificial reefs were characterized by pelagic and opportunist species. Differences occurred between the Caledonie Toho 2 assemblage, characterized by numerous sciophylous species (Apogonidae), and the Caissons assemblage, characterized by large carnivorous species (Serranidae, Lutjanidae). These differences were due to the different size, shape and age of the two artificial reefs. The Caledonie Toho 2 assemblage evolved from a pioneer to a secondary assemblage, with four species assemblages being successively identified. The first step of the colonization was the arrival of large fish from the Caissons and the recruitment of Chromis fumea (Pomacentridae). The other species assemblages were characterized by seasonal recruitment of juveniles and migration of pelagic and opportunist adult fish species. The secondary assemblage was characterized by an increasing migration of adults of specialized benthic species despite the persistence of a pool of pelagic and opportunist species. Consequently, the Caledonie Toho 2 acted more as an attraction device located on bare sand than a productive structure for the surrounding environment during the first 13 months after the scuttling.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,,0,0,0,,,0077-5630,,,,,,,,,,,"LERVEM, University of New Caledonia, Noumea, South Pacific, 98847, New Caledonia",,,,2001-06-01,BCI:BCI200100558596,,

This approach is widely used in the sea by purposefully scuttling ships to create artificial reefs, but its performance as a conservation tool is seldom critically examined in these situations. Here we test if the diversity of sessile invertebrate assemblages on a large, but young (3 years), artificial reef, created by sinking a 133 m long battle ship off Eastern Australia, can mimic that of nearby natural reefs. We use this system as a model to test whether this artificial reef can form compensatory habitat of comparable quality and levels of biodiversity. Our assessment is based on the abundance, species richness, and species composition of sessile invertebrate assemblages, including corals. Despite some signs that temporal trajectories of ecological metrics, such as cover, began to approach natural conditions after 3 years, the ecological structure of sessile invertebrate assemblages on this young wreck remained fundamentally different from those on nearby natural reefs. In particular, large, long-lived corals were abundant on natural rocky reefs, but were rare and covered little area on the young wreck. These data demonstrate that when trajectories to community convergence with natural habitats are prolonged, as may be the case here, any compensatory effects of artificial habitats will have a considerable time lag. Such lags have implications for appraising the conservation value of wrecks and artificial reefs, and they emphasize the need to explicitly acknowledge temporal dynamics when using artificial habitats as complementary conservation tools to augment larger conservation efforts on natural systems.",,,,,,,,,24,2,0,0,19,0,27,,,0960-3115,1572-9710,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Sunshine Coast, Fac Sci Hlth & Educ, Maroochydore, Qld 4558, AustraliaFrc Environm, Wellington Point, Qld 4160, Australia",Frc Environm,,,2014-02-01,WOS:000329990300011,,

The abundance of recruits in artificial collectors declined with patch size and was halved on reefs with sparse kelp compared to reefs with dense kelp or no kelp.

For example, in the German parts of the North and Baltic Sea approximately 1.6 million metric tons of toxic conventional explosives (TNT and others) and more than 5000 metric tons of chemical weapons are present. Such unexploded ordnance (UXO) constitutes a direct risk of detonation with increased human access (fisheries, water sports, cable constructions, wind farms and pipelines). Moreover, after more than 70 years of resting on the seabed, the metal shells of these munitions items corrode, such that chemicals leak out and distribute in the marine environment. Explosive chemicals such as TNT and its derivatives are known for their toxicity and carcinogenicity. In order not to endanger today's shipping traffic or the installation of pipelines and offshore plants by uncontrolled explosions, controlled blast-in-place (BiP) operations of these dangerous relics is a common practice worldwide. However, blast-in-place methods of in situ munitions disposal often result in incomplete (low-order) detonation, leaving substantial quantities of the explosive material in the environment. In the present free field investigation, we placed mussels (Mytilusspp.) as a biomonitoring system in an area of the Baltic Sea where BiP operations took place and where, by visual inspections by scientific divers, smaller and larger pieces of munitions-related materials were scattered on the seafloor. After recovery, the mussels were transferred to our laboratory and analyzed for TNT and its derivatives via gas chromatography and mass spectroscopy. Our data unequivocally demonstrate that low-order BiP operations of dumped munitions in the sea lead to multiple increases in the concentration of TNT and its metabolites in the mussels when compared to similar studies at corroding but still encased mines. For this reason, we explicitly criticize BiP operations because of the resulting environmental hazards, which can ultimately even endanger human seafood consumers.",,,,,,,,,24,0,0,0,14,0,24,,,0340-5761,1432-0738,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Med Sch Schleswig Holstein, Inst Toxicol & Pharmacol Nat Scientists, Campus Kiel,Brunswiker Str 10, D-24105 Kiel, Germany",,,,2020-07-01,WOS:000541090500006,32303806,

Prior studies have emphasized shoreline-hardening effects on faunal abundance and diversity; few have examined effects on faunal biomass and size structure or described effects specific to different functional groups. We evaluated the biomass and size structure of mobile fish and crustacean assemblages within two nearshore zones (waters extending 3 and 16 m from shore) adjacent to natural (native wetland; beach) and hardened (bulkhead; riprap) shorelines. Within 3 m from shore, the total fish/crustacean biomass was greatest at hardened shorelines, driven by greater water depth that facilitated access to planktivore (e.g., bay anchovy) and benthivore-piscivore (e.g., white perch) species. Small-bodied littoral-demersal species (e.g., Fundulus spp.) had greatest biomass at wetlands. By contrast, total biomass was comparable among shoreline types within 16 m from shore, suggesting the effect of shoreline hardening on fish biomass is largely within extreme nearshore areas immediately at the land/water interface. Shoreline type utilization was mediated by body size across all functional groups: small individuals (<= 60 mm) were most abundant at wetlands and beaches, while large individuals (> 100 mm) were most abundant at hardened shorelines. Taxonomic diversity analysis indicated natural shoreline types had more diverse assemblages, especially within 3 m from shore, although relationships with shoreline type were weak and sensitive to the inclusion/exclusion of crustaceans.

The results underscore the importance of within-reef-age benthic composition variability as a determinant factor in structuring local fish populations. As the Algarve AR complex consists of reefs deployed at different times and having different benthic communities, management needs to focus more effort on conserving entire habitats rather than exclusively on maintaining the sustainability of fish resources.

For a closer look, the fish assemblage was further divided into visitors and residents, and biomass was used as a parameter to represent production. Visitors were characterised by sporadic occurrences and highly variable school sizes. However, large schools (containing more than 200 kg of biomass) occurred only around small AR piles (consisting of less than 15 units of 2-m(3) concrete reef). Considering visitors alone, the correlation between biomass and pile size was not significant for the combined data from three sites. Changes in the standing stock of residents followed a clearer trend, and the relationship could be fitted to a sigmoidal equation. This trend shows that collections of the residents tended to increase until the pile reached a size of 20-30 reef units. Thereafter, the increase in biomass slowed, and maximum biomass would eventually be reached only with a further increase in the pile size. Predictions of the efficiency of unit reefs for different pile sizes indicate that a pile consisting of 4-10 units of this type of reef would be most effective in terms of biomass of residents. Nevertheless, a size of 15 units is recommended when the behaviour of visitors is taken into account. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B.V.

Bottom gillnets were used twice a year (wet versus dry seasons) to investigate how the composition and structure of fishing resources change over seasons during 20 years in the oldest experimental AR complex deployed in Southeastern Brazil. In total, 74 fish species were caught, and Sciaenidae, Carangidae and Ariidae families were the most representative in both numbers and occurrence. Fish abundance, species richness and biomass varied significantly between AR and reference site (RS), with higher values being recorded in the artificial habitats. Generalized additive models and ANOVA showed a gradual transition over time for the fish assemblages associated with the reef complex, indicating an initial phase primarily dominated by estuarine species, followed by an extended period of attraction by reef-associated fish and many species of commercial interest. The season was identified as the most important factor for the development of fish assemblages in the AR complex. Fish abundance increased gradually towards the 14th year after AR deployment and became more variable thereafter, with the stabilization or a abundance decreasing for some species. Our findings reveal that AR might be locally important for commercial species such as Rhizhoprionodon porosus, Macrodon ancylondon and Isopisthus parvipinnis, and highlight the importance of structurally complex structures as a promising strategy to enhance the attraction of fishery resources.",,,,,,,,,8,0,0,0,6,0,8,,,0272-7714,1096-0015,,,,,,,,,,"Fed Inst Sergipe IFS, Rodovia Juscelino Kubitschek S-N, BR-49680000 Nossa Senhora Da Gloria, BrazilUniv North Rio de Janeiro UENF, Environm Sci Lab, Av Alberto Lamengo 2000, BR-28013602 Campos Dos Goytacazes, BrazilUniv Alicante UA, Dept Marine Sci & Appl Biol, San Vicente Del Raspeig 03080, SpainFed Univ Rio de Janeiro State UNIRIO, Lab Theoret & Appl Ichthyol, Av Pasteur 458, BR-22290240 Rio De Janeiro, Brazil",Univ North Rio de Janeiro UENF,,,2020-09-18,WOS:000566686000007,,

(Method)Based on survey data from 2012 to 2013, the model of ecosystem health assessment, the pressure-state-response model(PSR) comprehensive index method was applied to assess ecosystem health status of the Egong Bay. (Result)The results showed that, the ecosystem health of the Egong Bay fisheries area was in healthy and healthier status during whole investigation period. Four seasons were ordered based on their ecosystem health indexes(EHI), as follows: spring>summer>autumn>winter. The main factor influencing ecosystem health of the Egong Bay fisheries area was organic pollution index. The health of artificial reef area in the Egong Bay fisheries area was better than that of control area. And in the artificial reef area, the density of phytoplankton, biomasses of benthic animals, diversity indexes of phytoplankton and benthos were in healthy status, and the eutrophication index, petroleum pollution index, zooplankton biomass were in healthier status, but the organic pollution index, density of nekton and density of roe and fry were in sub-health status.

We report on the first study in a series aimed at increasing our knowledge of the effects of morphology, substrate type, and location on the succession of reef organisms. The development of stony corals and fish communities associated with two types of constructions was examined, which were both made of aggregates of limestone rocks: one randomly aggregated (RA) reef comprising relatively small rocks and an orderly aggregated (OA) reef composed of relatively big rocks. Communities were censused every 4-6 months for more than 4 years, with a final coral census being taken after 100 months. The OA reef attracted significantly more fish species and a higher number of individuals than the RA reef, and reached its carrying capacity faster (30 months versus 50 months). In contrast, number of reef-building corals on the RA reef was significantly higher (in terms of both species and colonies) than on the OA reef, and the plateau was not even reached after 100 months. We conclude that in the Gulf of Aqaba, (1) for recreational purposes, small reefs (of a few cubic metres) may serve as attractive sites because they support relatively rich fish communities, (2) larger rocks, larger interstices and larger reef size induce higher species richness and greater numbers of fish, and (3) structural complexity, as measured by fractal dimension, is an important factor for the development of reef-building corals.

GELs are binary mixtures of synthetic lubricants and dissolved liquid carbon dioxide maintained at moderate pressure. The properties of these lubricating fluids can be dynamically adjusted by controlling mixture composition, and consequently can help reduce operating inefficiencies for wind turbines that are subject to dynamically changing loads. Reliable and adaptive lubricant systems are necessary for turbines to be made larger or to be installed in inaccessible or offshore sites. The proposed research proposed will build the foundation of chemical understanding that is necessary to select proper components and process operating conditions needed for optimal performance and minimum environmental impact. Preliminary modeling results suggest that GELs could reduce power losses in a fluid film bearing by over 20%. Intellectual Merit This study will measure the mechanical and thermal characteristics of GELs under relevant conditions and evaluate their behavior in a modified rotor test bed. The proposed study is broken down into five tasks: 1) Study the high pressure phase behavior of lubricants and carbon dioxide; 2) Measure the rheology of GELs under relevant pressure and temperature conditions; 3) Evaluate the thermal characteristics of GELs relative to straight lubricants; 4) Develop an experimental testbed to measure bearing performance using GELs; 5) Create a life cycle model of GEL delivery to establish large-scale feasibility. This research is potentially transformative because it represents a completely new approach to wind turbine lubrication that has considerable promise to make significant improvements in increasing the energy efficiency for electric power generation from wind energy. The proposed research has the potential to advance fundamental understanding of the tribology of high-pressure liquid/gas mixtures, their phase behavior, and flow properties. Specifically, the research plan seeks to reveal the effect of two important lubricant parameters, viscosity and density, in predicting stiffness and shear forces in rotating machinery. An understanding of these relationships will be developed for a family of bio-based synthetic lubricant chemistries. The results will be validated experimentally using a specially modified test rig that mimics the nonlinear loadings typical of real wind turbines. This new understanding will be summarized in a set of design guidelines and tools which can be easily used by the wind industry. The results of this work will have clear implications for wind turbine manufacturers and supporting industries trying to improve turbine life and reduce the generation cost of wind electricity. Broader Impacts The education activities will contribute to a larger effort to develop a green energy education programs in the state of Virginia. The recent boom in manufacturing and service sectors associated with sustainable technologies such as wind energy suggests that training programs must be implemented to provide skills for people hoping to work in these areas. The PIs have partnered with Southwest Virginia Higher Education Center to provide a course in wind turbine fundamentals and maintenance to augment existing curricula for both university and community college students. Research outcomes will be transferred to industry via the Rotating Machinery and Controls (ROMAC) university-industry cooperative program at the University of Virginia (UVa) and its forty industrial partners, including GE, Rolls Royce Energy, and Praxair.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,967915,,,,,,,,University of Virginia Main Campus,,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:13956464,,

One example is the problem of wildlife collisions with vehicles or human-built structures (e.g., power lines, wind farms). In fact, collisions between marine wildlife and watercraft are among the major threats faced by several endangered species of marine mammals. Natural resource managers are therefore interested in finding cost-effective solutions to mitigate these threats.We combined abundance estimators with encounter rate theory to estimate relative lethal collision risk of the Florida manatee (Trichechus manatus latirostris) from watercraft. We first modelled seasonal abundance of watercraft and manatees using a Bayesian analysis of aerial survey count data. We then modelled relative lethal collision risk in space and across seasons. Finally, we applied decision analysis and Linear Integer Programming to determine the optimal design of speed zones in terms of relative risk to manatees and costs to waterway users. We used a Pareto efficient frontier approach to evaluate the performance of alternative zones, which included additional practical considerations (e.g., spatial aggregation of speed zones) in relation to the optimal zone configurations.Under the various relationships for probability of death given strike speed that we considered, the current speed zones reduced the relative lethal collision risk by an average of 51.5% to 70.0% compared to the scenario in which all speed regulations were removed (i.e., the no-protection scenario). We identified optimal zones and near-optimal zones with additional management considerations that improved upon the current zones in terms of cost or relative risk.Policy implications. Our analytical framework combines encounter rate theory and decision analysis to quantify the effectiveness of speed zones in protecting manatees while accounting for uncertainty. Our approach can be used to optimize the design of protection zones intended to reduce conflicts between human waterborne activity and marine mammals. This framework could be extended to address many other problems of human-wildlife interactions, such as the optimal placement of wind farms to minimize collisions with wildlife or the optimal allocation of ranger effort to mitigate poaching threats.",,,,,,,,,17,0,0,0,12,0,18,,,0021-8901,1365-2664,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Florida, Dept Wildlife Ecol & Conservat, Gainesville, FL 32611 USAUS Geol Survey, Wetland & Aquat Res Ctr, Gainesville, FL USAINRA 97170, Zootechn Researchers URZ, UR143, Petit Bourg, French West Ind, FranceFlorida Fish & Wildlife Conservat Commiss, Fish & Wildlife Res Inst, St Petersburg, FL USAUniv Maryland, Dept Biol, College Pk, MD 20742 USAUS Fish & Wildlife Serv, Jacksonville, FL USAFlorida Fish & Wildlife Conservat Commiss, Fish & Wildlife Res Inst, Gainesville, FL USA",,,,2019-05-01,WOS:000471343200003,,

The new procedure relates to past and present CP design practice, but the proposed technique is first principles-based rather than empirical. The procedure inherently accommodates the rapid polarization approach, which promotes formation of a particularly protective calcareous deposit and establishment of a low-maintenance current density.

However, many studies evaluating their effects on these populations have been hindered by a lack of preconstruction data from existing natural habitats and temporal comparisons with control areas. Here, we present findings froma before-after control-impact study designed to assess the effects of a new artificial reef on fish populations in the western Gulf of Mexico. Vertical line and fish traps were used to sample the reef site and a paired control site with soft bottom substrates for 1 year before and 2 years after reef construction. Prior to reef construction in October 2013, and over bare substrates in general, infrequent catches of sea catfishes and small coastal sharks were observed. With the exception of rare occurrences of juvenile Gray Triggerfish Balistes capriscus and Red Snapper Lutjanus campechanus, which were observed only during the summer recruitment season, the control site exhibited a lack of reef species. In contrast, we documented dramatic increases in the frequency of occurrence and abundance of multiple reef species at the reef site following the addition of structured habitat. Distinct cohorts of Red Snapper could be followed through time suggesting site fidelity, and few fish greater than age 2 years were captured indicating limited migration of older fish from other areas. Given that the reef supported high densities of juvenile Red Snapper that were in good condition, growing quickly, and protected from potential shrimp trawl mortality, export of juveniles (i.e., production) to the adult population was evident and likely greater on a per-unit-area basis than for the control site. Our study highlights the potential benefits of artificial reefs to species like Red Snapper; however, future studies should investigate the relative roles of emigration and fishing mortality to better understand the effects of these structures on reef fish population dynamics.",,,,,,,,,18,0,0,0,15,0,22,,,1942-5120,,,,,,,,,,,"Texas A&M Univ Corpus Christi, Harte Res Inst Gulf Mexico Studies, 6300 Ocean Dr, Corpus Christi, TX 78412 USAFlorida Atlantic Univ, Harbor Branch Oceanog Inst, 5600 US 1 North, Ft Pierce, FL 34946 USATexas Parks & Wildlife Dept, Artificial Reef Program, 4200 Smith Sch Rd, Austin, TX 78744 USA",Texas Parks & Wildlife Dept,,,2017-12-15,WOS:000417037900005,,

A failure to deliver proper maintenance services may adversely affect the wind farm availability and thereby reducing power output as well as profitability. The organization of maintenance logistics for offshore wind farms has received a reasonable attention in the literature to date. The purpose of this article is to review the state-of-the-art of maintenance logistics in offshore wind energy. It proposes a classification scheme involving three echelons of strategic, tactical and operational decision-making. The strategic echelon deals with decisions regarding wind farm design for reliability, location and capacity of maintenance accommodations, selection of wind farm maintenance strategy, and outsourcing the repair services. The tactical echelon embraces spare parts inventory management, maintenance support organization, and all decisions regarding purchase or lease of maintenance resources. The operational echelon includes scheduling of maintenance tasks, routing of vessels, and measuring the maintenance performance. Our findings indicate that the strategic decisions of maintenance logistics have received the most attention in the literature, followed by the tactical and operational decisions. Also, three categories of selection of maintenance strategy, maintenance support organization and scheduling of maintenance tasks are the most addressed areas of research. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Here we provide a novel perspective on this issue, specifically regarding the nutrient dynamics of biogeochemical hotspots that develop following artificial reef construction. Fishes can translocate nutrients (i.e., nitrogen and phosphorus) from the surrounding seascape and concentrate them around artificial reefs, often increasing localized primary production. We discuss an example of this in a seagrass ecosystem, using a case study demonstrating the specific mechanism by which aboveground primary production is enhanced. Namely, when nutrient supply exceeds an ecological threshold, non-linear shifts in nutrient allocation occurs to aboveground tissues, serving to increase localized primary production. Identifying such ecological thresholds in resource allocation provides a powerful predictive tool in the context of fishery management. We suggest that such an ecosystem-level perspective should become more prominent in discussions regarding the attraction-production question of artificial reefs. (C) 2016 Elseiver B.V.

Benthic community structure, fish assemblages and habitat complexity were compared between reef types using an asymmetrical design. Although natural reefs supported distinct biotic assemblages, as a class, these reefs differed significantly from NAR. The artificial reef was dominated by macroalgae and supported fewer benthic categories, whereas the natural reefs were characterised by a diverse range of sessile invertebrates. Benthic and demersal fish assemblages were less diverse on NAR, but pelagic fish assemblages were similar on both reef types. The substratum of NAR was less complex than that of the natural reefs; this physical variable was correlated with some of the differences in benthic communities and benthic and demersal fish assemblages.

We present data on greenhouse gas (GHG: carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), and nitrous oxide (N2O)) concentrations and fluxes, as well as data that allow for characterization of sources and dynamics of carbon pools collected along the Zambezi River, reservoirs and several of its tributaries during 2012 and 2013 and over two climatic seasons (dry and wet) to constrain the interannual variability, seasonality and spatial heterogeneity along the aquatic continuum. All GHG concentrations showed high spatial variability (coefficient of variation: 1.01 for CO2, 2.65 for CH4 and 0.21 for N2O). Overall, there was no unidirectional pattern along the river stretch (i.e., decrease or increase towards the ocean), as the spatial heterogeneity of GHGs appeared to be determined mainly by the connectivity with floodplains and wetlands as well as the presence of man-made structures (reservoirs) and natural barriers (waterfalls, rapids). Highest CO2 and CH4 concentrations in the main channel were found downstream of extensive floodplains/wetlands. Undersaturated CO2 conditions, in contrast, were characteristic of the surface waters of the two large reservoirs along the Zambezi mainstem. N2O concentrations showed the opposite pattern, being lowest downstream of the floodplains and highest in reservoirs. Among tributaries, highest concentrations of both CO2 and CH4 were measured in the Shire River, whereas low values were characteristic of more turbid systems such as the Luangwa and Mazoe rivers. The interannual variability in the Zambezi River was relatively large for both CO2 and CH4, and significantly higher concentrations (up to 2-fold) were measured during wet seasons compared to the dry season. Interannual variability of N2O was less pronounced, but higher values were generally found during the dry season. Overall, both concentrations and fluxes of CO2 and CH4 were well below the median/average values for tropical rivers, streams and reservoirs reported previously in the literature and used for global extrapolations. A first-order mass balance suggests that carbon (C) transport to the ocean represents the major component (59 %) of the budget (largely in the form of dissolved inorganic carbon, DIC), while 38% of the total C yield is annually emitted into the atmosphere, mostly as CO2 (98 %), and 3% is removed by sedimentation in reservoirs.",,,,,,,,,112,5,0,0,85,0,120,,,1726-4170,1726-4189,,,,,,,,,,"Katholieke Univ Leuven, Dept Earth & Environm Sci, Leuven, BelgiumUniv Zambia, Integrated Water Res Management Ctr, Lusaka, ZambiaUniv Liege, Chem Oceanog Unit, Liege, Belgium",,,,2015-01-01,WOS:000353840500011,,

The resulting habitats created were visually surveyed during an eight-month period, and a total of 26 species, belonging to 16 families, were observed. Diplectrum formosum, Orthopristis ruber, Haemulon aurolineatum and Paralabrax dewegeri were the first species to be found in every station, being also the most common species found during the survey. The highest diversity value was found in station number 3 (2,89 bits/ind) in February 2008, and the lowest value (0,73 bits/ind) was found in station number 2 in September 2007. Due mainly to the exceptional calculated values of station 3, a significant difference in the diversity value was observed among the stations; however the differences between the monthly surveys were not significant. The highest equitability value found was 0.95 at station 4 in February 2008, and the lowest value of 0,28 was found at station 2 in September 2007. In reference to the dominance, no statistical difference was found among the four stations, or between the different monthly surveys. The highest number of species found was 17 at station 3 in February 2008, while the lowest number of species (4) occurred during November 2007 and January 2008 in station 4. According to this parameter, significant differences were found among the stations, caused by the exceptional results obtained from station 3, but there were no differences between the months. In conclusion, the significant differences found at station 3, both in the number and in the diversity of species could have been caused by the near location of a fish and mollusk aquaculture facility, which might have attracted young and adult fish that could have then migrated to the artificial habitat, thus raising the values of the evaluated parameters at station 3.

They range from Ventimiglia, in the west, to La Spezia, in the east, with the largest and best known reef complex being located in the Gulf of Genoa at Loano and consisting of 3 2,745 m, about 5,200 t of material and covering a surface of 350 ha. Design and construction practices have advanced from an initial, unsuccessful effort that used automobile bodies (now banned) to current use of custom-designed concrete modules deployed systematically. Funding for reef construction has come since 1983. The earliest aim of reefs was as a physical barrier to protect habitats against illegal otter trawl fishing. Newer objectives include habitat restoration, enhancement of biodiversity and fishing catch, and research to test materials and designs for physical and ecological performance. Reefs also functions as environmental observation stations, with the invasive species Caulerpa taxifolia (Vahl) C. Agardh, being recorded on the reef at Alassio. For some Artificial Reefs (Ars), benthic organisms and fishes, settlement, biomass and development of community are recorded. In Loano AR, immersed in 1986, more than 150 algae species are recorded, more than 200 benthic animal species and 78 species (87 taxa) of fishes. Fifty-six species (61 taxa) of fishes are recorded by visual census, the others are caught only by trammel net and long line. Trammel catches at Loano are on average about 2.32 kg/100 m net. Comparisons among ARs reveal that age of the reef, location and presence of seagrass meadows are crucial for success. An indication of functional equivalence between ARs and natural rocky reefs is seen if both fish and sessile macrobenthos are compared. After 34 years of investigation a database comprising at least one hundred scientific articles based on research programs of up to 15 years, and other unpublished reports, provides information to guide future planning of reefs. On the basis of acquired experience, some management advice is suggested and the best design for the basic module in the Ligurian sea is described.

The use of artificial reefs could aid in the rehabilitation of Red Snapper stocks by providing refuge for juveniles and a place of foraging and recruitment. A study was initiated to determine the effectiveness of different artificial reef distribution patterns in attracting and sustaining juvenile Red Snapper in the northern Gulf of Mexico. Fish traps (0.97m long; 0.64m high; funnel mouth size = 175x115mm) were used to collect Red Snapper (<406mm TL) that were associated with pyramid-shaped artificial reef structures (3.7-m triangular base; 2.4-m height; 3.2 metric tons) to evaluate two reef distribution designs: (1) five closely spaced pyramid units (clumped pattern) and (2) five closely spaced pyramids plus two sets of two pyramids at 30.5, 61.0, or 91.5m from the five pyramids (outlier pattern). In 26 sampling trips, 927 Red Snapper were captured. Catch per unit effort (number of fish/trap soak-hour) did not differ significantly among artificial reef patterns (P = 0.396). Red Snapper TLs differed significantly among patterns (P = 0.005), with the largest mean TL (235mm; SE = 5.14) occurring at the outlier pattern with 61.0-m spacing.

J,,,,,,,,,A. H. Day,,Feasibility of an Innovative Methodology for Testing Marine Current Turbines in Unsteady Flow,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Awarded Grant,Mar 31 2008,2008,"In the early years of the offshore oil industry, many design challenges were met by the incorporation of large factors of safety to allow for a lack of fundamental understanding of appropriate values of design loads. The high profitability of the oil business allowed the resulting high-cost solutions in the short-term; whilst occasional failures could not threaten such a well financed industry. In contrast, the economics of marine renewable energy do not allow such a high-cost approach, whilst early failures in high-profile projects could cause immense damage to the confidence placed in such a fledgling industry. In order to succeed technically and economically, MCT designs must meet stringent environmental legislation, must be efficient, cost effective, environmentally friendly and above all reliable. For this reason it is important to have a fundamental understanding not only of the performance of the rotor itself, but also of the global hydrodynamic loading on the system, in order to allow safe and cost-effective design of the mooring/anchoring system. There has been extensive research over many years aimed at finding approaches for determining drag, added mass and damping effects of fixed and floating offshore structures in unsteady flows - that is flows which vary with time, such as waves, or fluctuating currents - however the applicability of these approaches to the rotating blades of an MCT rotor is highly questionable raising uncertainties in perceived knowledge. The importance of the unsteady loading on the rotors is all the more apparent when their dimensions are considered; current proposals involve pairs of rotors of over 10m diameter, with a swept area which may be 50 times the projected area of the support structure. The global loading is therefore clearly dominated by the moving rotor. The importance of the unsteady hydrodynamic loads, often characterized by added mass and damping coefficients, is further emphasized by the relatively small real mass of these devices in comparison to conventional marine and/or offshore structures. For both fixed and compliant structures, maximum loading as well as fatigue performance are important issues; for compliant structures the influence of the unsteady rotor forces on the global dynamic response is also likely to be a critical parameter in the mooring design. MCTs are likely to operate in environments in which large currents and steep waves will be evident, and appreciable unsteady flows are inevitable. In such cases it is essential that the global added mass and damping of the rotors can be reliably evaluated for a wide range of unsteady flows.Whilst some progress towards the understanding of the unsteady response can be made with sea trials using large scale models, the lack of controllability and repeatability of the real-world environment presents substantial challenges to the development of fundamental understanding of these effects, particularly with regard to extreme conditions. A laboratory-based experimental technique is thus required which can be used to develop this fundamental understanding both directly, through experiment measurement, and indirectly, via the verification and validation of numerical simulation approaches. The study proposed here therefore aims to establish the feasibility of a model-testing methodology to predict these unsteady global loads as well as operational efficiency parameters on horizontal axis marine current turbines, addressing an interesting and challenging hydrodynamic problem of significant practical relevance.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,EP/F062036/1,,,,,,,,University of Strathclyde,,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:15356034,,

However, some species can adapt and even benefit from such modifications. Artificial reefs have long been used to provide habitat for invertebrate communities and promote local fish populations. With the increasing demand for energy resources within ocean systems, there has been an expansion of infrastructure in near-shore benthic environments which function as de facto artificial reefs. Little is known of their use by marine mammals. In this study, the influence of anthropogenic sea floor structures (pipelines, cable routes, wells and shipwrecks) on the foraging locations of 36 adult female Australian fur seals (Arctocephalus pusillus doriferus) was investigated. For 9 (25%) of the individuals, distance to anthropogenic sea floor structures was the most important factor in determining the location of intensive foraging activity. Whereas the influence of anthropogenic sea floor structures on foraging locations was not related to age and mass, it was positively related to flipper length/standard length (a factor which can affect manoeuvrability). A total of 26 (72%) individuals tracked with GPS were recorded spending time in the vicinity of structures (from 75% of the foraging trip duration) with pipelines and cable routes being the most frequented. No relationships were found between the amount of time spent frequenting anthropogenic structures and individual characteristics. More than a third (35%) of animals foraging near anthropogenic sea floor structures visited more than one type of structure. These results further highlight potentially beneficial ecological outcomes of marine industrial development.",,,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2016-05-17,DRCI:DATA2016074008571198,,

The number of taxon was calculated from the data of both the net types, while the copepod abundance was done using the samples from Model II only. Sixteen species of planktonic copepods, including 5 dominant species, were recorded. Results reveal that Oithona similis was the first dominant species from March to June, and was replaced by Paracalanus parvus in September; both dominated the copepod community in January.

Through a close empirical historical study, this article reconstructs how Greenpeace's protest of the deep-water disposal of the Brent Spar spurred the exclusion of rigs-to-reefs (the conversion of obsolete offshore oil and gas structures into artificial reefs) as a viable decommissioning option by the primary international treaty organization with jurisdiction over North Sea waters, the Oslo-Paris Commission (OSPAR). During OSPAR's artificial reef guideline development, several OSPAR contracting parties implied that there is a conspiracy among oil companies to use rigs-to-reefs as a cover for evading the deep-water disposal rules, although they never presented evidence to back up these claims. In the face of pressure to close the loophole for deep-water disposal and in spite of scientific objection. OSPAR's final guidelines excluded all non-virgin materials as acceptable reef construction materials, essentially banning rigs-to-reefs. Because a significant number of steel offshore installations will be decommissioned in North Sea waters in the decade and the most up-to-date science has concluded that manmade deep-water reefs may be beneficial to some species including threatened cold-water coral, this article suggests that OSPAR revise its guidelines. Rigs-to-reefs should be not categorically excluded; a case-by-case determination of the suitability of a structure for reuse as an artificial reef would be most appropriate. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Understanding how EMF interactions (a potential pressure) affect resource species (receptor) requires an improved knowledge base to aid management decisions. Within the framework of a potential effect on a receptor, we review key aspects of assessing EMF exposure. From the vantage point of the receptor species, we consider how their perception of EMF varies through time as a consequence of species' sensory biology, life history theory, and movement ecology. We review known effects of EMFs on species and consider EMF interactions with benthic, bentho-pelagic, and migratory species, focusing on functional roles of electro- and magneto-reception at different life stages. We must move our understanding from individual effects to population-level impacts. The present knowledge base has been drawn from a diverse range of laboratory and field approaches, which can be better integrated to address gaps and reach the desired knowledge base. Improving models of future scenarios depends on taking a more systematic and consistent approach to measuring and modeling alternating current and direct current EMFs and accounting for cable properties and local environmental characteristics. We make recommendations to help decipher receptor species' responses. Acquiring such knowledge will enable us to translate EMFs, and their effects and encounter rates, into impact assessments for resource species to inform appropriate management.",,,,,,,,,18,1,0,0,9,0,19,,,1042-8275,,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Rhode Isl, Grad Sch Oceanog, Narragansett, RI 02882 USAUniv Maryland, Chesapeake Biol Lab, Ctr Environm Sci, Solomons, MD 20688 USACefas, Ctr Environm Fisheries & Aquaculture Sci, Lowestoft, Suffolk, England",,,,2021-02-03,WOS:000606322400013,,

Quasi-spatial ecosystem simulations, using a modified ECOSIM method, have been employed to forecast benefits from a successful MPA/AR system. Results indicate that, despite increasing fishing power in the Hong Kong fleet, a 10-20% MPA/AR system could provide significant benefits within 10 yrs, and shifts to low-value pelagic fish could be reversed. Approximate scores, expressing how species benefit from protected ARs, suggest that results are not biased by changes in species composition. The design of MPA/ARs balances island biogeographic theory with the needs of monitoring and compliance: minimizing perimeter losses and establishing colonizing corridors are trade-offs with statistical replication and monitoring, whereas sacrifice of some ARs to fishing encourages compliance and learning. In Hong Kong, workshops with fishing communities encouraged support. Bioeconomic analysis shows an MPA/AR system increasing fishery value, but noncompliance rapidly erodes benefits.

This paper reviews the environmental, social and political questions surrounding energy and environment in general, and analyses the passionate arguments surrounding onshore wind farm developments in Scotland in particular. Scotland has the best onshore and offshore wind resources in Europe, with almost a quarter of the total resource, and onshore wind is now rapidly overtaking hydropower as the renewable technology with the greatest generating capacity. This development has proved highly controversial, with many schemes attracting vociferous public opposition. This review explores the main issues involved and shows that whilst some of the controversy centres on factual issues such as job creation, intermittency or bird mortality, a primary reason why consensus is so elusive is that conflicting values lie at the core of the debate. Issues such as landscape aesthetics, community (dis)empowerment and the relative importance of global and local factors are perceptual, unquantifiable and shaped by personal world views. Consequently, even if all the misinformation provided by those supporting or opposing wind farms was removed, profound disagreements would remain about the appropriate choices for securing Scotland's future power supply. The paper highlights the need to deepen our understanding of the social construction of public attitudes, to develop better criteria for strategic locational guidance and to investigate the potential of emerging development models such as community-scale wind power schemes.",,,,,,,,,65,0,0,0,4,0,76,,,1470-2541,1751-665X,,,,,,,,,,"Univ St Andrews, Sch Geog & Geosci, St Andrews KY16 9AL, Fife, ScotlandMacaulay Inst, Aberdeen, Scotland",,,,2009-01-01,WOS:000268802000002,,

The work is advancing a fundamental understanding of soil-structure interactions to develop a novel and sustainable foundation concept for offshore wind turbines: a Flying Wing Anchor. This anchor is a steel plate in the shape of an aerodynamically efficient winged aircraft. The anchor is installed silently and efficiently using gravity from free fall through the water column and penetration into the sea floor. Tension in the line that attaches the wind turbine structure to the anchor causes the anchor to dive and pitch toward the horizontal in service, maximizing the available holding capacity in bearing over the full wing surface in an extreme load. The intellectual challenges are (1) modeling the resistance of soil against a foundation in shear and bearing over the orders-of-magnitude range of strain rates corresponding to free-fall penetration, line pre-tensioning and ultimately storm loading and (2) capturing the dynamic, fully six-degree-of-freedom movement of a foundation as it flies through the soil during installation and service. The research plan comprises a comprehensive approach to physically testing scale models of a Flying Wing Anchor during penetration and in-service loading and numerically modeling the three-dimensional behavior with time of a Flying Wing Anchor with the Finite Element Method (FEM) and advanced constitutive models. It capitalizes on a U.S.-Ireland Research and Development Partnership Program to bring together a multidisciplinary, multiple-institution team that represents the European state-of-the art in offshore wind development and the U.S. state-of-the-art in offshore foundations. The project partners include The University of Texas at Austin, the University of Rhode Island, University College Dublin and Queen's University Belfast. With external funding from Invest NI and Science Foundation Ireland, the U.S. investment in this project is leveraged at a ratio of nearly 3 total dollars for each dollar invested from NSF. This research has the potential to improve foundation systems over a wide range of offshore and onshore applications by developing a green foundation concept, where nature initially installs it through gravity and then completes the installation through in-service loading. This research aims to reduce the economic and environmental cost of harnessing offshore wind energy, which is a key challenge to increasing the availability of renewable energy. This research will benefit society at large by providing cross-country and cross-Atlantic education and research opportunities for graduate and undergraduate students, by fostering excitement in engineering and science for school children through exposing them to the development of a novel concept and giving them an opportunity to examine it themselves through a model testing facility, and by increasing public awareness of the promises and challenges of renewable energy through public demonstrations and workshops.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,1300142,,,,,,,,University of Rhode Island,,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:14032996,,

We used bioenergetics models to estimate community-level nutrient supply by fishes, and relevant measures of primary production, to test the hypothesis that consumers, via excretion of nutrients, can enhance primary production and alter nutrient limitation regimes for two dominant primary producer groups (seagrass and benthic microalgae) around artificial reefs. Both producer groups demonstrated marked increases in production, as well as shifts in nutrient limitation regimes, with increased fish-derived nutrient supply. Individuals from the two dominant functional feeding groups (herbivores and mesopredators) supplied nutrients at divergent rates and ratios from one another, underscoring the importance of community structure for nutrient supply to primary producers.

Although support for their use is strong among managers and resource users, there is still inadequate scientific information available on their performance in meeting program goals; performance and ecological function information is also weak on many types of natural reefs and fishery-valuable shipwrecks. The wise and responsible use of artificial reefs or habitats by habitat or fishery managers depends on knowing how well they are meeting application objectives; these objectives can be singular or multiple and can involve compliance with laws and regulations. Noncompliance monitoring provides good feedback information to managers and artificial reef designers and planners for continued support and improvement of their efforts. Artificial reef development in the U.S.A. has perhaps reached a state in which an equal effort is needed for construction and for monitoring, assessment, and program fine-tuning for optimum beneficial results. Support for this shift in emphasis can be found in the fact that the continued expansion of artificial reef development has not stopped the decline of many reef fishery resources, such as black sea bass, groupers, snappers, and tautog, or caused many user conflicts. If the artificial reefs and habitats are not completely meeting program expectations, then managers will want to know this and what might be the causes of the shortfall. This paper discusses how monitoring is an essential part of any artificial reef program, just as it is a part of most other fishery and natural resource management efforts, and that there are a range of artificial reef habitat or reef fishery variables that can or should be monitored that provide critical performance information for aquatic resource managers.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1998-06-01,BCI:BCI199900213018,,

ARs have been, widely constructed along the Chinese coast. However, understanding of benthic habitats in the vicinity of ARs is limited, hindering effective fisheries and aquacultural management. Multibeam echosounder (MBES) is an advanced acoustic instrument capable of efficiently generating large-scale maps of benthic environments at fine resolutions. The objective of this study is to develop a technical approach to characterize, classify, and map shallow coastal areas with ARs using an MBES. An automated classification method is designed and tested to process bathymetric and backscatter data from MBES and transform the variables into simple, easily visualized maps. To reduce the redundancy in acoustic variables, a principal component analysis (PCA) is used to condense the highly collinear dataset. An acoustic benthic map of bottom sediments is classified using an iterative self-organizing data analysis technique (ISODATA). The approach is tested with MBES surveys in a 1.15 km(2) fish farm with a high density of ARs off the Yantai coast in northern China. Using this method, 3 basic benthic habitats (sandy bottom, muddy sediments, and ARs) are distinguished. The results of the classification are validated using sediment samples and underwater surveys. Our study shows that the use of MBES is an effective method for acoustic mapping and classification of ARs. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

We experimentally assessed the relationship between fish abundance and richness to increased distance (0, 25, 100, and 300 m) to reef balls deployed on a flat and homogeneous bottom, 9-m deep, on the north coast of Rio de Janeiro, Southeastern Brazil. A total of thirty fish species was associated with the reefs and the variation in species composition with sampling period or technique did not account for changes in fish assemblages with reef distance. Fish abundance and richness were significantly greater at the nearest distances (0 m and 50 m) to the reefs than at 300 m, but while the first dependent variable decreased exponentially with reef distance the later diminished linearly. Fish responses to reef distance were clearly species-specific and the tomtate (Haemulon aurolineatum - the dominant species that probably used the reefs for shelter purposes) strongly influenced the exponential decreasing pattern found for the total number of fishes and abundance of Haemulidae. The abundance of the close congener Haemulon steindachneri, and of Chaetodon striatus, Serranus flaviventris and serranid species as a group also decreased, but linearly, with reef distance, probably related to variation in home-range. Acanthurus chirurgus and Scorpaena isthmensis decreased linearly in number with reef distance, probably due to feeding rather than refuge purposes. The abundance of Isopisthus parvipinnis tended to increase with reef distance, suggesting that artificial reefs might be unprofitable for those species less dependent on clear water or structurally complex habitats to obtain refuge or food. Overall, our study indicates that artificial reefs are a promising management tool to enhance fish capture in the oligotrophic waters and structureless bottoms of the north coast of Rio de Janeiro, but with varied rates of success, depending on the target species and fishing distance from the reefs.

Three of the eight taxonomic groups examined showed a positive association with the artificial reef (with model fit poor for the remaining groups); and depth and bottom cover were also influential variables. The spatial scales of these associations with the artificial reef were small, and it was generally the presence of reef (i.e. a reef bottom type) that explained more variation in fish abundance than did distance to reef.

Artificial reefs provide substrates that facilitate the rapid recruitment of marine biota such as corals and fish, and are commonly employed as coral restoration tools to assist recovery in degraded areas. While this strategy is successful in the immediate years post-deployment, its contribution to restoration over longer time scales is less well understood.2. The biological communities on Reef Enhancement Units (REUs), which had been deployed for more than a decade on Singapore's sediment-affected coral reefs, were surveyed.3. The diversity of sessile lifeforms on the REUs was significantly higher in 2014 (H=1.03) than 2004 (H=0.60). Hard corals and coralline algae contributed most to the temporal dissimilarity and turf algae remained the dominant lifeform category in both years.4. In 2014, hard corals and abiotic components contributed most to the spatial dissimilarity among the six REU plots that were surveyed. Shannon diversity values of these plots ranged from 0.74-1.3. Scleractinian cover ranged from 0.4-31.5% and differed significantly among the plots.5. The REUs also augmented ecosystem functioning at their respective plots. Colonies from 10 of the 30 scleractinian genera recorded were sexually mature, and a total of 119 sessile and mobile reef taxa utilized the REUs for food and habitat.6. The results demonstrate that artificial reefs can contribute to the development of biological communities and ecosystem functioning in degraded coral habitats over the long run, and underscore the need for long-term monitoring to validate the effectiveness of reef restoration efforts.",,,,,,,,,23,1,0,0,16,0,26,,,1052-7613,1099-0755,,,,,,,,,,"Natl Univ Singapore, Trop Marine Sci Inst, 18 Kent Ridge Rd, Singapore 119227, Singapore",,,,2017-11-19,WOS:000413551100009,,

Underwater exploratory vehicles typically employ wide-aperture Sound Navigation and Ranging (SONAR) imaging sensors. Although their wide aperture enables scouring large volumes of water ahead of them for obstacles, the resulting images produced are blurry due to integration over the aperture. Performing three-dimensional (3D) reconstruction from this blurry data is notoriously difficult. This challenging inverse problem is further exacerbated by the presence of speckle noise and reverberations. The state-of-the-art methods in 3D reconstruction from sonar either require bulky and expensive matrix-arrays of sonar sensors or additional narrow-aperture sensors. Due to its low footprint, the latter induces gaps between reconstructed scans. Avoiding such gaps requires slow and cumbersome scanning by the vehicles that carry the scanners. In this paper, we present two reconstruction methods enabling on-site 3D reconstruction from imaging sonars of any aperture. The first of these presents an elegant linear formulation of the problem, as a blind deconvolution with a spatially varying kernel. The second method is a simple algorithmic approach for approximate reconstruction, using a nonlinear formulation. We demonstrate that our simple approximation algorithms perform 3D reconstruction directly from the data recorded by wide-aperture systems, thus eliminating the need for multiple sensors to be mounted on underwater vehicles for this purpose. Additionally, we observe that the wide aperture may be exploited to improve the coverage of the reconstructed samples (on the scanned object's surface). We demonstrate the efficacy of our algorithms on simulated as well as real data acquired using two sensors, and we compare our work to the state of the art in sonar reconstruction. Finally, we show the employability of our reconstruction methods on field data gathered by an autonomous underwater vehicle.",,,,,,,,,39,1,0,0,1,0,42,,,1556-4959,1556-4967,,,,,,,,,,"Heriot Watt Univ, SeeByte Ltd, Ocean Syst Lab, Edinburgh, Midlothian, ScotlandUniv Edinburgh, Edinburgh, Midlothian, ScotlandHeriot Watt Univ, Edinburgh, Midlothian, Scotland",,,,2018-10-16,WOS:000446433000004,,

During the lower river discharge period the results indicated a potential disturbance in the functional structure of the AR fish community and, therefore, a less stable environment relative to the control areas.

On this site visual censuses of fish carried out by SCUBA divers once a month over a twelve month period in 1985-6 and again in 1995 showed that only one species of fish and one species of macro-invertebrate were added in 1995 to a total of 36 species of fish and four macro-invertebrates counted ten years earlier. Of the fish species recorded on the artificial reef 18.7% were Lessepsian migrants from the Red Sea, passing to the eastern Mediterranean through the Suez canal; 75.7% were of Atlanto-Mediterranean origin. The contribution of Red Sea species to the overall fish biomass in the artificial reef complex however, increased from 64% in 1985-6 to 94% in 1995. The change was due mainly to a significant increase (244%) in the population of the Red Squirrelfish Sargocentron rubrum and a decrease in the population of sparids (41-90%) and Dusky Grouper, Epinephelus marginatus (44.8%). Similar increases in Red Sea immigrants were reported by coastal fisheries and observed in other artificial and natural outcrops. One possible explanation for this phenomenon is the competitive exclusion of autochtonous species by a successful Lessepsian migrant, taking over spatial and perhaps food resources. Over-fishing of the commercially important groupers and sparids may provide an alternative explanation for this biomass change in the ichthyofauna. In view of these findings, artificial reefs are suggested as representative sites for observations on long-term ecological changes in bony fish populations.",,,,,,,,,14,0,0,0,10,0,17,,,0214-8358,,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Haifa, Leon Recanati Inst Maritime Studies, IL-31905 Haifa, IsraelUniv Haifa, Dept Maritime Civilizat, IL-31905 Haifa, Israel",,,,2000-09-01,WOS:000089282700003,,

Increasing anthropogenic pressures are eroding such habitats, reducing their complexity and potentially altering ecosystem stability on a global scale. Yet, we have only a rudimentary understanding of how structurally complex habitats create ecological refuges for most ecosystems. Better informed management decisions require an understanding of the mechanisms underpinning the provision of physical refuge and this may be linked to prey size, predator size and predator identity in priority habitats. We tested each of these factors empirically in a model biogenic reef system. Specifically, we tested whether mortality rates of blue mussels (Mytilus edulis) of different sizes differed among: (i) different forms of reef structural distribution (represented as 'clumped', 'patchy' and `sparse'); (ii) predator species identity (shore crab, Carcinus maenas and starfish, Asterias rubens); and (iii) predator size. The survival rate of small mussels was greatest in the clumped experimental habitat and larger predators generally consumed more prey regardless of the structural organisation of treatment. Small mussels were protected from larger A. rubens but not from larger C. maenas in the clumped habitats. The distribution pattern of structural objects, therefore, may be considered a useful proxy for reef complexity when assessing predator-prey interactions, and optimal organisations should be considered based on both prey and predator sizes.

At Santa Catalina Island, California, twenty 2.25-m2 artificial reefs were established and stocked with similar numbers and size-distributions of blackeye gobies during the summers of 2012 and 2013. Photographs of nests were taken weekly for [approximately]3 months each summer. Through analysis of photographs, incubation time was found to be more than 7 days but less than 14 days. Nests, each guarded by one male, contained an average of 8664 eggs, in an area of 43.8 cm2, with 215 eggs cm-2. Blackeye gobies laid eggs during all lunar phases and the number of eggs produced was not related to lunar phase. Reproductive output, however, was negatively correlated with water temperature, with populations on reefs that experienced cooler temperatures producing more eggs. The presence of eggs in a nest had little effect on behavior of blackeye gobies on that reef. Additional observations made outside of summer months indicated that blackeye gobies can reproduce year-round in southern California.

Smart meters are being tested around the globe in pilot projects and have already experienced a massive rollout in some European countries. However, the initial enthusiasm has somewhat faded after the first field tests; utilities, policymakers and scholars now share a more differentiated view on the actual savings potentials. Where do business executives see future value creation in the intelligent grid and smart meters? Are smart grid and smart meters inevitable components of the future energy system, or just temporary hype that does not create lasting profitability beyond environmental marketing?

Offshore wind farms may pose direct risks to seabirds at protected breeding sites. However, changes in food availability may influence foraging behaviour and habitat use during the breeding season or between years. Consequently, seabird-wind farm interactions, and risks posed to populations, may vary over longer time scales, but this has seldom been quantified. We used GPS-telemetry to study the movements of 25 lesser black-backed gulls from the Aide-Ore Special Protection Area (SPA), UK between 2010 and 2012, while birds were associated with their breeding colony. Variation in movements away from the colony, offshore, and in operational, consented and proposed Offshore Wind Farm Areas (OWFAs) was investigated: (1) between years and (2) across the breeding season, addressing: (3) sex-specific, (4) individual and (5) diurnal/nocturnal differences. The extent of overlaps with OWFAs varied between years, being greatest in 2010 (7/10 birds showing connectivity; area overlap: 6.2 +/- 7.1%; time budget overlap: 4.6 +/- 6.2%) and least in 2012. Marine habitats close to the colony were used before breeding. Birds spent little time offshore as incubation commenced, but offshore usage again peaked during the early chick-rearing period, corresponding with use of OWFAs. Individuals differed in their seasonal interactions with OWFAs between years, and males used OWFAs significantly more than females later in the breeding season. This study demonstrates the importance of tracking animals over longer periods, without which impact assessments may incorrectly estimate the magnitude of risks posed to protected populations.

The floating platform of the present study is stable to the rolling and pitching motions among waves, deferent from the spar-type floating offshore wind buoy, and it is used for the multi-purpose such as the base of the solar panels and the wave power apparatus, including the fishery activities inside the hexagonal platform. A unit platform is supported by the 6 vertical cylinders which are connected by the truss. The hydrodynamic forces/moments of the platform among waves are calculated by the interaction theory for many numbers of floating bodies. For the safety of the floating platforms, the wave and wind loads acting on the platforms should be considered under the extreme environmental condition. The computational fluid dynamics(CFD) analysis is applied and developed for such severe conditions. The model tests under the winds and waves were conducted in the tank. Finally, the principal dimensions of the floating platform in Hakata Bay were determined on the basis of the present study.

Depending on the microbial community and surrounding environment, they may either contribute to the wreck's preservation or deterioration. Even within a single wreck, preservation and deterioration processes may vary, suggesting that the microbial community may also vary. This study aimed to identify the differences through widespread sampling of the microbial communities associated with the Pappy Lane shipwreck (NC shipwreck site #PAS0001), a shallow water ferrous-hulled shipwreck in Pamlico Sound, North Carolina to determine if there are differences across the wreck as well as from its surrounding environment. Loose shipwreck debris, drilled shipcores, surrounding sediment, and seawater samples were collected from the Pappy Lane shipwreck to characterize the microbial communities on and around the shipwreck. Results indicated that the shipwreck samples were more similar to each other than the surrounding sediment and aquatic environments suggesting they have made a specialized niche associated with the shipwreck. There were differences between the microbial community across the shipwreck, including between visibly corroded and non-corroded shipwreck debris pieces. Relative abundance estimates for neutrophilic iron-oxidizing bacteria (FeOB), an organism that may contribute to deterioration through biocorrosion, revealed they are present across the shipwreck and at highest abundance on the samples containing visible corrosion products. Zetaproteobacteria, a known class of marine iron-oxidizers, were also found in higher abundance on shipwreck samples with visible corrosion. A novel Zetaproteobacteria strain, Mariprofundus ferrooxydans O1, was isolated from one of the shipwreck pieces and its genome analyzed to elucidate the functional potential of the organism. In addition to iron oxidation pathways, the isolate has the genomic potential to perform carbon fixation in both high and low oxygen environments, as well as perform nitrogen fixation, contributing to the overall biogeochemical cycling of nutrients and metals in the shipwreck ecosystem. By understanding the microbial communities associated with shallow water ferrous-hulled shipwrecks, better management strategies and preservation plans can be put into place to preserve these artificial reefs and non-renewable cultural resources.

Most of the time helicopter offshore operations are conducted over open water and often in degraded visual environment. Such scenarios provide very few usable visual cues for the crew to safely pilot the aircraft. For instance, no landmarks exist for navigation and orientation is hindered by weather phenomena that reduce visibility and obscure the horizon. To overcome this problem, we are developing an external vision system which uses a non-see-through, head-worn display (HWD) to show fused sensor and database information about the surroundings. This paper focuses on one aspect of our system: the computer-generated representation of relevant visual cues of the water surface. Our motivation is to develop a synthetic view of the surroundings that is superior to the real out-the-window view. The moving water surface does not provide fixed references for orientation and sometimes even produces wrong motion cues. Thus, we replace it by a more valuable, computer-generated clear view. Since pilots estimate wind direction and speed by checking the movement characteristics of the water surface, our synthetic display also integrates this information. This paper presents several options for a synthetic vision display supporting offshore operations. Further, it comprises results from simulator trials, where helicopter pilots performed final approaches and landings on an offshore platform supported by our display. The results will contribute to the advancement of our HWD-based virtual cockpit concept. Additionally, our findings may be relevant to conventional, head-down synthetic vision displays visualizing offshore environments.",,,,,"Conference on Degraded Environments - Sensing, Processing, and DisplayConference on Degraded Environments - Sensing, Processing, and Display","APR 17-18, 2018APR 17-18, 2018",SPIESPIE,"Orlando, FLOrlando, FL",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,0277-786X,1996-756X,978-1-5106-1796-4,,,,,,,,,"German Aerosp Ctr DLR, Inst Flight Guidance, Braunschweig, Germany",,,,2018-12-28,WOS:000452438500009,,

This work has been undertaken on behalf of The Offshore Wind Strategic Monitoring Research Forum (OWSMRF) (https://jncc.gov.uk/our-work/owsmrf/). OWSMRF is an industry-led collaborative forum that aims to identify and develop research to fill critical knowledge gaps in our understanding of the impact of offshore wind development on the marine environment. OWSMRF stakeholders identified cumulative impacts on kittiwakes as the priority need for improving understanding of offshore windfarm environmental impacts. Improving understanding of collision-induced mortality was identified as one of the key knowledge gaps in this area. JNCC has collaborated with experts in this field to provide a summary of potential research which might help to reduce uncertainty in estimates of collision-induced mortality. This report provides a summary of existing relevant research and evidence, and research opportunities that have been identified to help reduce the uncertainty. The research opportunities (ROs) suggested as potentially very useful and presented in this report are: RO1.1: strategic collision monitoring project; deploying turbine monitoring systems (likely to be primarily camera-based system such as DTBird, WTBird or similar) across a range of turbines and windfarms to collect empirical data on kittiwake collision rates. This would allow validation of CRM approach and empirical cumulative effects assessment. This project would need to be undertaken in stages: RO1.1a updated review of technology to detect collisions with turbines (as in Dirksen et al. 2017). This may need to include a field test if promising technology has not yet been deployed in offshore situation. RO1.1b power analysis and strategic framework for deployment of monitoring systems. RO1.1a and R01.1b combined would maximise the value of such data collected across windfarms. RO1.1c deployment of systems across a range of turbines and windfarms to collect empirical kittiwake collision data. RO1.2: coordinated strategic GPS tracking programme across multiple colonies. This would include accelerometer deployment. Such a coordinated programme would improve understanding of spatial and temporal patterns in distributions and behaviour in and around windfarm, and how this evolves over the course of a consent: pre, during and post construction. RO1.3: concurrent collection of flight height data using multiple sensors. This would improve understanding of accuracies, biases, and comparability of flight height information collected by a variety of different methods. This would inform accuracy of various available flightheight data to improve precision in resulting collision risk estimates. Further research opportunities that could reduce uncertainty in estimates of kittiwake mortality at windfarms are described briefly: - RO1.4: analysis of existing GPS tracking data to understand variation in risk across turbines. - RO1.5: analysis of pre and post construction density data to inform macro-avoidance, and how windfarm design might influence this. - RO1.6: analysis of pre and post construction GPS data to understand if/how kittiwakes alter behaviour in response to windfarms. - RO1.7: assessing whether kittiwakes respond to changing wind conditions (turbine wake effect) within windfarms. - RO1.8: tagging of juvenile birds to compare their collision risk to that of adults. - RO1.9: GPS tracking to complement EOWDC bird avoidance study; providing bird movements over a broader spatial scale for comparison with EOWDC data collected within a functioning windfarm. - RO1.10: strategic LiDAR survey to provide flight height information at a broad spatial scale, to inform kittiwake sensitivity mapping. - RO1.11: simulation study to assess how accurately transect-based density estimates capture flux through a windfarm. - RO1.12: strategic (non-GPS) tracking study, as described in Black and Ruffino (2019), using a combination of VHF radio tags, PIT tags and colour ringing, deployed as to maximise the ability to obtain survival rates of kittiwakes which interact with windfarms versus those not interacting with windfarms. Each RO alone could lead to improvements in understanding of cumulative collision risk across windfarms, and the degree to which uncertainty is reduced is likely to increase as more ROs are undertaken. Undertaking a carefully selected, complementary selection of these ROs could significantly reduce uncertainty in assessments of cumulative mortality of kittiwake from offshore windfarm deployment.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,0963-8091,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2019-12-01,ZOOREC:ZOOR15709060090,,

In contrast, the literature contained few studies that unambiguously demonstrated that artificial reefs increased regional fish production rather than merely concentrated available biomass.

To identify fish species and determine the characteristics of the water column, simultaneous biological sampling and oceanographic surveys were carried out. The vertical distribution of Japanese jack mackerel varied with their age and size and between seasons. In June and July, aggregations of juvenile (age 0; <10 cm in length) Japanese jack mackerel were found in a layer between 20 and 50 m deep associated with a temperature range of 19-21 degrees C. However, the age-0 aggregations were not observed from August to November. Conversely, the age-1+ schools aggregated around the artificial reefs when the temperature was <19 degrees C.

The US Department of the Interior, Minerals Management Service, and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Office of Ocean Exploration and Research sponsored this multidisciplinary project under the auspices of the National Oceanographic Partnership Program.

J,"Ruffino, L.; Thompson, D.; O'Brien, S.",,,,,,,,,,Black-legged kittiwake population dynamics and drivers of population change in the context of offshore wind development.,,,,,,,,JNCC Report,,,,651,,,,i,"vii, 1-59",,,,,,,,,,,Article,May 2020,2020,"This report presents a summary of existing evidence, and potential research opportunities, to better understand the population dynamics of black-legged kittiwakes and how populations might respond to potential additional mortality from offshore wind farm development. This work has been undertaken on behalf of the Offshore Wind Strategic Monitoring and Research Forum (OWSMRF) (https://jncc.gov.uk/our-work/owsmrf). OWSMRF is an industry-led collaborative forum that aims to identify and develop research to fill critical knowledge gaps in our understanding of the impact of offshore wind development on the marine environment. OWSMRF stakeholders identified a lack of understanding of cumulative impacts from offshore wind development on kittiwakes as one of the greatest environmental consenting risks. Improving confidence in models that assess population response to offshore wind farm mortality was identified as one of three key knowledge gaps in this area, the other two being: reducing uncertainty around estimates of collision mortality and connectivity between offshore wind farms and SPAs. JNCC organised a workshop that aimed to identify research opportunities that will improve understanding of kittiwake population dynamics and drivers of population change in the context of offshore wind development, thereby improving our ability to predict population response to novel impacts. During the workshop, experts were invited to suggest research that would fill gaps in our current understanding of kittiwake population dynamics, under three high-level objectives: 1 Reduce uncertainty around current PVA (population viability analysis) modelling approaches through obtaining better evidence with which to parameterise PVA models; 2 Improve understanding of the wider context in which current typically colony-specific PVA approaches sit, e.g. the wider spatial scale at which population processes, such as meta-population dynamics and density dependence might be operating; 3 Identify drivers of change in kittiwake populations and their mechanism of operation to understand the relative impact of offshore wind development alongside other pressures, and options for managing pressures to inform discussions around I ROPI/derogation conservation measures. This report provides a summary of existing evidence, followed by research opportunities (RO) suggested by experts that would fill gaps in our current understanding of kittiwake population dynamics in the context of offshore wind development. The research opportunities were: Research Opportunities leading to better parameterisation of current population modelling approaches and improved understanding of wider context of kittiwake population dynamics (Objectives 1 and 2 above): RO3.1 Use of large-scale strategic modelling approaches to better understand kittiwake meta-population dynamics and estimate connectivity among colonies. This project makes use of an existing meta-population modelling framework, which has been developed by the University of Glasgow, to estimate the strength of connectivity among kittiwake colonies in key areas of Britain and Ireland. The outputs of this model will also inform the optimisation of future monitoring and data collection of the most influential demographic parameters. This would provide a better understanding of the wider population context in which individual kittiwake SPA colony dynamics operate, e.g. is the Flamborough and Filey Coast SPA operating as a source or sink population and how does this change predictions of population response to additional mortality? RO3.2 Further development of a population modelling tool that assists with assessing population response to changes in mortality or productivity. This project will add additional functionality to an existing on-line PVA Tool, specifically a meta-population function that allows emigration and immigration to be incorporated into the population models. Movement rates will be informed by the outputs of RO3.1. This would improve confidence in predicted population response to estimated mortality from a planned offshore wind development by bringing more biological realism to current PVA approaches. It would also enable better modelling of other management measures that could increase productivity and survival, thereby informing evaluation of conservation measures. RO3.3 Strategic mark-recapture studies to improve empirical estimates of connectivity and survival. This project will assess the feasibility of a large-scale kittiwake mark-recapture study, such as colour-ringing, in the UK to improve empirical estimates of key demographic rates such as survival and dispersal rates. Better estimates of these parameters are needed to improve the parameterisation of PVA and meta-population models, e.g. RO3.1 and RO3.2, leading to improved confidence in predictions of how kittiwake populations are likely to respond to offshore wind farm mortality. RO3.4 Reconstructing adult survival rates for populations where empirical estimates are lacking. This project addresses the lack of population-specific empirical estimates of kittiwake survival rates. It will make use of an existing modelling approach developed by the University of Glasgow to reconstruct survival estimates for kittiwake colonies of interest where this information is lacking. This information would enable better parameterisation of population models, as described in RO3.1 and RO3.2. RO3.5 Estimating the form and strength of compensatory density-dependence in kittiwake population dynamics at different spatial scales. This project makes use of the rich kittiwake colony monitoring datasets available in the UK, as well as existing robust population modelling approaches, to try to detect patterns of compensatory density-dependence in kittiwake colonies. The form and strength of density dependence used in PVA models strongly influences model predictions about how the population will respond to additional mortality. Obtaining and implementing novel empirical data on how density dependence operates on populations and the spatial and temporal scales over which density dependence might occur will improve confidence in PVA predictions. RO3.6 Detecting depensation effects by modelling kittiwake population dynamics. With this project, it is proposed to build a model to assess the relative importance of depensatory density dependence in breeding kittiwake populations, evaluate its strength and infer where and when this process may be more likely to occur. Identifying at what population size/density kittiwake populations are at risk of declining to extinction due to depensation effects is important as additional mortality on populations could inadvertently push populations into such a decline. RO3.7 Evaluating the proportion of UK kittiwake populations that are non-breeding adults. This RO is a desk-based study to estimate the extent of non-breeding in UK kittiwake populations using available data on population size, breeding success and adult survival. The results from this RO would help better estimate the proportion of non-breeders in kittiwake populations and anticipate their ability to buffer a population against declines (including steeper declines for already declining populations) in size due to reduced adult survival and/or productivity. This will bring more biological realism to current PVA models and improve confidence in predictions about how populations will respond to offshore wind mortality. Research Opportunities focussing on understanding potential kittiwake population response to changes in management of drivers of population change (Objective 3 above): RO3.8 Examining the ecosystem processes driving the relationship between kittiwake breeding success and sea surface temperature. This RO will improve understanding of how climate change is impacting kittiwake productivity and how other factors may be compounding the negative effects of warming seas. This RO will examine how various environmental and biological factors may have led to variation in breeding success between colonies and within colonies over time. Better understanding of what determines productivity at different colonies will improve predictions of how kittiwake populations are likely to change in the future due to climate change, along with other drivers of change such as offshore wind development. It will also ensure that potential conservation measures account for environmental and biological drivers of population change, and that conservation measures are effective and achieve the desired outcomes. RO3.9 Kittiwake diets during the breeding season, and the relationship between prey availability and productivity. This project is a combination of desk-based and field studies to determine kittiwake dietary patterns during the breeding season and improve our understanding of the relationship between non-sandeel prey availability and productivity. This RO will help build confidence in how kittiwake populations are responding to declines in sandeel availability and thus assess their resilience to additional mortality, e.g. from offshore wind development. This would also provide key evidence to inform conservation measures, such as how kittiwake populations might respond to changes in management of commercial fisheries. RO3.10 Assessing the current and future condition of alternative fish prey populations: a desk-based study. With this RO, it is proposed to review the literature on forage fish species, specifically population status and trends, drivers of population dynamics, current fishing pressure and projected impacts of climate change on forage fish populations. This information will assist with identifying kittiwake colonies that are vulnerable to additional mortality and those that are likely to be more resilient to additional mortality, e.g. from OWF development, due to predicted availability of prey/forage fish species. Additionally, this will help assess which conservation management measures may be ineffective due to changes in forage fish populations. RO3.11 Quantifying the effects of fisheries management on kittiwake demography. This RO involves designing a monitoring plan that would maximise power to detect changes in demographic rates that could be attributed to changes in fisheries management. This would be followed by data collection prior to changes in fishing effort, which would provide a baseline against which to assess demographic response to management. This project will enable evaluation of the effectiveness of fishing-related conservation measures. RO3.12 Predicting the demographic consequences of various potential measures to manage pressures on kittiwake populations. This project would develop a strategic modelling framework that would enable identification of those pressures that exert the most detrimental effects on kittiwake demographic rates and then evaluate potential management options in terms of population rates of change. This information would bring wider context to current PVA assessments of population response to offshore wind mortality and inform likely efficacy of potential conservation measures. Specifically, this project would demonstrate the relative impact of offshore wind development on kittiwake populations, alongside other drivers of population change. Several of these research opportunities would complement each other, and combined, could greatly increase our understanding of kittiwake population dynamics and how populations are likely to respond to offshore wind farm development and conservation management measures. This would lead to significant reductions in uncertainty in assessments of cumulative impacts on kittiwake from offshore wind farm developments.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,0963-8091,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2020-05-01,ZOOREC:ZOOR15712083127,,

A random sample of 1,059 sport divers was selected from dive charter boat records; 614 divers took trips to the Flower Gardens Banks National Marine Sanctuary and 445 divers in proportion to the known number of non-Flower Gardens trips by coastal region. An 11-page mail questionnaire was used to collect social and economic data from the sample of divers. Of the 1,059 questionnaires mailed, 528 were returned usable for an overall effective response rate of 56.2%. About 256 (56% of those who went diving in Texas marine waters in the previous 12 months) indicated they took one or more trips in the previous 12 months to artificial reefs in Texas offshore waters. This paper will focus on the group of sport divers who used artificial reefs. Artificial reefs included manmade materials deployed as bottom reefs, wrecks, and standing oil and gas platforms. Most divers participated in activities such as night diving (81%), underwater photography (53%), wreck diving (52%), and marine identification (52%); only 25% participated in spear fishing. Two estimates of sport diver offshore trip days (1,985 and 5,953) were multiplied by the average per trip expenditure for Texas residents ($162) yielding estimated total expenditures (direct economic impact) in coastal communities of $261,439 to $784,106. Total expenditures in coastal communities by non-residents of Texas were considerably less ($58,885 to $176,606). The overall economic impacts of artificial reef diving in Texas where dive charter boats were used to access offshore reefs are presented in terms of changes in total output, income, and total employment. This paper excluded private boat divers who used artificial reefs offshore and charter and private boat divers accessing the Flower Gardens Banks National Marine Sanctuary. The overall economic impact of sport diving in Texas would be higher if these other segments were included. Finally, the paper will emphasize methods and address methodological difficulties involved in studying this particular group of marine resource users and their activities.",,,,,53rd Annual Meeting of the Gulf-and-Caribbean-Fisheries-Institute53rd Annual Meeting of the Gulf-and-Caribbean-Fisheries-Institute,"NOV 06-10, 2000NOV 06-10, 2000","Mississippi, Alabama Sea Grant ConsortiumMississippi, Alabama Sea Grant Consortium","UNIV SO MISSISSIPPI, INST MARINE SCI, BILOXI, MSUNIV SO MISSISSIPPI, INST MARINE SCI, BILOXI, MS",4,0,0,0,3,0,5,,,,,*************,,,,,,,,,"Texas A&M Univ, Dept Wildlife & Fisheries Sci, College Stn, TX 77843 USA",,,,2002-01-01,WOS:000181335800031,,

Clumps of live M. modiolus were translocated onto three treatments: flattened cultch, elevated cultch, and directly onto the sea floor. Photographic surveys were carried out 1, 6, and 12 months after completion of the experimental array to test the hypothesis that the artificial reef would enhance habitat complexity thus increasing biodiversity and accelerating faunal community succession. These effects were predicted to be greater on elevated cultch due to higher level of protection and greater accessibility to food compared to sea floor treatments. Univariate analysis indicated that after 12 months the artificial reef had developed a significantly richer and more diverse community compared to 1- and 6-month stages. Multivariate analysis revealed a significant temporal shift in species composition from mobile taxa to sessile and interstitial macroinvertebrates as the artificial reef settled. Reef elevation offered no significant advantages for the development of the epifaunal assemblage.

Artificial reefs (ARs) have been distributed across the nGOM in attempts to enhance reef fish habitat and increase fishery productivity, but few data exist to distinguish ecological from fishery functions of ARs compared to natural reefs (NRs), particularly at the regional scale. Therefore, we conducted remotely operated vehicle surveys of reef fish communities at 47 reef sites within a similar to 20,000 km(2) area of the nGOM shelf and tested the effect of reef type (NR versus AR), depth (<= 35 or >35 m), relief (<= 2m or >2 m), and complexity (low or high) on fish diversity and community structure as well as trophic guild- and species-specific densities. Twenty-one species were present at >20%, nine at >50%, and three at >75% of study reefs. Fishery species (i.e., Lutjanus campechanus, Serioia dumerili, and Rhomboplites aurorubens) and invasive Pterois volitans were frequently observed (>50% of sites) or numerically dominant, especially at ARs. Main effects did not significantly affect the presence of specific species or trophic guilds, but interactions among factors significantly affected species- and trophic guild-specific densities. Our results indicate that effects of habitat characteristics on fish communities are more nuanced than previously described. Fish communities are moderately similar at the majority of sites but specific habitat characteristics can interact to dramatically affect densities of some species, particularly those that depend on complex structures for refuge. Simple ARs tend to concentrate high densities of a few important fishery species with low densities of other small demersal reef fishes. Complex NRs with high relief also support high densities of planktivorous fishery species but greatly increase densities of small, demersal, non-fishery species that directly utilize complex reef structure for refuge.",,,,,,,,,13,0,0,0,11,0,13,,,0272-7714,1096-0015,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Florida, Fisheries & Aquat Sci, 7922 NW 71st St, Gainesville, FL 32653 USAFlorida Int Univ, Biscayne Bay Campus,3000 NE 151st St, North Miami, FL 33181 USA",,,,2020-01-16,WOS:000505649500008,,

Over-harvest may directly affect key population regulation mechanisms (e.g., density dependence), with the magnitude of the effects being further influenced by changes in landscape structure and associated resource availability. Because resource availability and conspecific density often co-vary within the natural landscape, manipulative experiments are needed to understand how changes in these two drivers may affect density dependence in wild populations. We used a common, shoaling, coral reef fish (white grunt, Haemulon plumierii) as our model species, and manipulated fish densities and landscape context of artificial reef habitats to assess the effects of each on fish condition. We found evidence of inverse density dependence, where individual condition was positively related to conspecific density; landscape context had little effect. Mean grunt condition on natural patch reefs was similar to that for our low grunt density treatment artificial reefs, possibly due to differences in fish densities or landscape context.

We conducted a field experiment to test whether visual stimuli influenced the relative abundance of fish on an artificial reef. We discovered that visual cues from an illusion created by a mirror installed on the reef increased the relative abundance of highly reef-associated fish. Specifically, when exposed to the mirror, numbers of highly reef-associated fish increased 35% relative to an experimental control treatment with a transparent added structure and 54% relative to a full control without an added structure. These results demonstrate that visual cues, such as illusions of additional habitat and more fish, can entice more highly reef-associated fish to use artificial reefs and play a more substantial role in habitat selection than the effects of added physical structures alone.

This new method based on the combination of existing Multi-Criteria Decision-Making (MCDM) with Expert Systems (ES), Weighted Linear Combination (WLC) and field study. In this research suitable artificial reefs areas were determined through 3 stages of analysis: (i) evaluation (identification, scoping and weighting) criteria and sub criteria using literature review, Delphi method and Pair-Wise comparison (PWC), respectively; (ii) construction of the GIS model based on MCDM approach; and (iii) verification of the GIS model outputs and prioritization of the selected areas using field study and Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP), respectively. As a result, seven alternatives (7.2% of the study area) were identified as the most preferred areas for CAR sitting. Ranking of alternatives by AHP indicated that zones 7 and 6 obtained the highest priority and zones 5, 2, 3, 4 and 1 had the lowest priority for CAR establishing in Kish Island, respectively. In this study the WLC and AHP was used for identification and prioritization of the most preferred areas, respectively. There was a difference between the results of the WLC and AHP. We propose the WLC should be used for the identification and AHP should be used for prioritization of alternatives. (c) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Sampling stations were located at Gouqi Island of Ma' an Archipelago, Zhejiang Province. Species composition, diversity, relative abundance, biomass and community patterns of fish at the pelagic and benthic waters of mussel farming habitat were analyzed by using diversity indices, relative fishing efficiency indices and multivariate analysis. The results showed that Mugil cephalus and Konosirus punctatus were the dominant species in pelagic waters during autumn and winter, whereas in bottom waters Sebastiscus marmoratus and Larimichthys polyactis were the dominant species during autumn, and Harpadon nehereus and Johnius belangerii were the dominant species during winter. L. polyactis was found with high abundance both in pelagic and benthic waters during both seasons. The relative catch rates in pelagic waters were higher than in benthic waters during both seasons. Higher abundance and biomass of fish were recorded in pelagic waters than in benthic waters during both seasons. The results of multivariate analysis revealed two significantly different fish composition patterns from the pelagic and benthic waters regardless of seasons. It is concluded that the mussel farming habitat can act as a floating artificial reef system. Therefore, we suggest that the floating artificial reefs can be deployed in the design of marine ranching to achieve three-dimension conservation effects. Besides, artificial reefs can be set at the bottom of mussel farming area to enhance marine ranching effects.",,,,,,,,,4,3,0,0,3,0,7,,,1000-4890,1000-4890,,,,,,,,,,"Shanghai OCean Univ, Coll Marine Sci, Shanghai 201306, Peoples R China",,,,2015-06-29,BCI:BCI201500480553,,

Results indicated that fish diets were not modified on the artificial reefs compared to natural environments, nor was the structure of their trophic network. Artificial reefs, with their complex design, provide diverse and abundant food sources for fishes. Ranges of delta C-13 and delta N-15 of artificial reef fishes were comparable to those recorded in natural Mediterranean environments, with a similar trophic organization. However, some discrepancies appeared when comparing fish trophic level based on isotopic or diet results, which calls for a careful interpretation of stable isotope values as direct indicators of trophic level.

Under this trend, more turbines will be installed in wind farms. However, the inspection of the turbines in an offshore wind farm is a challenging task because of the harsh environment (e.g., rough sea, strong wind, and so on) that leads to high risk for workers who need to work at considerable height. Also, inspecting increasing number of turbines requires long man hours. In this regard, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) can play an important role for automated inspection of the turbines for the operator, thus reducing the inspection time, man hours, and correspondingly the risk for the workers. In this case, the optimal number of UAVs enough to inspect all turbines in the wind farm is a crucial parameter. In addition, finding the optimal path for the UAVs' routes for inspection is also important and is equally challenging. In this paper, we formulate a placement optimization problem to minimize the number of UAVs in the wind farm and a routing optimization problem to minimize the inspection time. Wind has an impact on the flying range and the flying speed of UAVs, which is taken into account for both problems. The formulated problems are NP-hard. We therefore design heuristic algorithms to find solutions to both problems, and then analyze the complexity of the proposed algorithms. The data of the Walney wind farm are then utilized to evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithms. Simulation results clearly show that the proposed methods can obtain the optimal routing path for UAVs during the inspection.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2022-11-23,PPRN:22867905,,

In the North Sea alone, the decommissioning liability is estimated at 40 billion by 2040. Current international policy requires removal of offshore infrastructure when their production life ends; however, this policy is being questioned as emerging data reveal the importance of these structures to fish and invertebrate populations. Indeed, some governments are developing 'rigs-to-reef (RTR) policies in situations where offshore infrastructure is demonstrated to have important environmental benefits. Using Remotely Operated Vehicles (ROVs), this study quantified and analysed fish and invertebrate assemblage dynamics associated with an oil and gas (O&G) complex in the Dogger Bank Special Area of Conservation (SAC), in the North Sea, Germany. We found clear depth zonation of organisms: infralittoral communities (0-15 m), circalittoral assemblages (15-45 m) and epibenthic communities (45-50 m), which implies that 'topping' or 'toppling' decommissioning strategies could eliminate communities that are unique to the upper zones. Sessile invertebrate assemblages were significantly different between structures, which appeared to be driven by both biotic and abiotic mechanisms. The O&G complex accommodated diverse and abundant motile invertebrate and fish assemblages within which the whelk BUCCilliLLITI undaturn, cod fish Gothic morhua and lumpsucker fish Cyclopterus lumpus used the infrastructure for different stages of reproduction. This observation of breeding implies that the structures may be producing more fish and invertebrates, as opposed to simply acting as sites of attraction (sensu the 'attraction vs production' debate). At present, there are no records of C. lumpus spawning at such depth and distance from the coast, and this is the first published evidence of this species using an offshore structure as a spawning site. Overall, this study provides important new insight into the role of offshore O&G structures as habitat for fish and invertebrates in the North Sea, thereby helping to inform decommissioning decisions.",,,,,,,,,26,0,0,0,20,0,26,,,0141-1136,1879-0291,,,,,,,,,,"Ocean Sci Consulting Ltd, Spott Rd, Dunbar EH42 1RR, East Lothian, ScotlandSouthampton Solent Univ, East Pk Terrace, Southampton SO14 0RD, Hants, EnglandUniv Hull, Ctr Environm & Marine Sci, Scarborough Campus,Filey Rd, Scarborough YO11 3AZ, N Yorkshire, EnglandDeakin Univ, Ctr Integrat Ecol, Sch Life & Environm Sci, Geelong, Vic 3216, Australia",Ocean Sci Consulting Ltd,,,2018-12-28,WOS:000452943500008,30274717,

Four yrs after the establishment of the artificial reefs, microphytobenthos abundance was twice as high in reef plots (1.7 +/- 0.1 mu g chl-a cm(-2)) compared to control plots (0.9 +/- 0.1 mu g chl-a cm(-2)).

The potential ecological and economic impacts of this species are significant. A rapid response eradication programme in Holyhead Harbour is currently underway, showing signs of some success so far. However, it is not known how far this species has spread within the UK, and surveys are underway in England and Wales to determine its distribution. It is crucial to know as soon as possible how far it has spread, as this information will determine what the appropriate response will be - if it is confined to only a few sites, it may be possible to attempt eradication. If it is already more widespread, then containment or control measures will be more appropriate. No specific surveys targeting this species had previously been carried out in Scotland, so it was not known whether it was present just in the one marina in the Clyde or whether it was more widespread. This project involved a series of rapid assessment surveys of those marinas and harbours thought to be most likely at risk from establishment (e.g. those in the Clyde and on the west coast of Scotland) and will inform SNH's policy for dealing with this species, as well as the wider UK policy for response. Main findings Didemnum vexillum was only found in one out of the 12 marinas surveyed in south-west Scotland in February 2010: Largs Yacht Haven. Of the 12 additional sites surveyed in the vicinity of Largs Yacht Haven in April 2010, D. vexillum was observed at three locations: Fairlie Quay Jetty, Fairlie moorings and Clydeport Jetty. D. vexillum was well established throughout Largs Yacht Haven at a water depth between [approximately]1 and 5 m and typically occurred on pilings, ropes, plastic cables, tyres, keep cages and on other marine organisms including the mussel Mytilus edulis, barnacles and the solitary tunicate Ciona intestinalis. D. vexillum was well established at Fairlie Quay Jetty at the low water level on [approximately]70% of pilings. Fairlie moorings had one record and Clydeport had three records. D. vexillum was not found on suitable natural substrates on the seabed in the vicinity of Largs, suggesting a preference for artificial structures and/or vertical substrates. It is possible that D. vexillum was introduced to the marina, nearby jetties and moorings via hull fouling on vessel(s) during 2009. As an initial step in management of this species, a total of 147 hanging items were removed from the pontoons in Largs Yacht Haven. These ranged from short pieces of lightly fouled rope to tyres and heavily fouled ropes and settlement panels and included three anchor chains. Of the items removed, 65 were found to be colonised by D. vexillum. If allowed to disperse from this site, D. vexillum poses a considerable risk to the Scottish aquaculture industry and to marine habitats of conservation value. Increased awareness of D. vexillum and clear guidelines on how to minimise the spread of this species must be urgently produced in close collaboration with the commercial and recreational maritime sector.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,1759-4014,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2011-06-21,ZOOREC:ZOOR14707052422,,

Moreover, we provide information on whether the wreck is located inside one of the World's Protected Areas, key biophysical Standard Level Data from the World Ocean Database, distance to reefs from the Coral Trait Database, and distances to 597 aquariums that are members of the Species360 global network of Aquariums and Zoological institutions, in the Zoological Information Management System (ZIMS). We provide data for wrecks with monitoring surveys in the peer -review literature, although these only comprise 2% of the records (36 of 1907 wrecks). The data we provide here can be used for research and evaluation of already deployed reefs, especially if combined with additional spatial information on biodiversity and threats.

Assemblage structure was quantified by spatially replicated photo transects on a recently scuttled large navy ship off the East Australian coast, lying in 27 m of water. A rich assemblage of epifauna had colonized the wreck within a year, dominated by barnacles, sponges and bryozoans.

Offshore oil and gas exploration has been increasing worldwide in the last years and is taking place in deeper waters and extreme environments. Impacts on the environment include, impact on fish stocks and mammals during seismic surveys, emissions through gas flaring, operative pollution derived from daily activity such as discharge of substances and accidental pollution. From the environmental point of view, the offshore oil and gas exploration and exploitation may be divided into two stages. First, the stage previous to the installation of the structures that I will denominate 'preventive-precautionary stage', where the security aspects and all the preventive-precautionary tools introduced by Environmental law as environmental impact assessment, monitoring, participation of citizens shall be applied in order to avoid environmental damage. If environmental law tools are not appropriately applied during this stage, the second stage, liability and reparation for environmental damage will follow. The essential results show that there is no international convention in force regarding the issue; however, there have been several attempts to achieve this objective. Two accidents, the first one a blow-out occurred in 2009 on the Montara well situated in the Australian EEZ which affected the cost of Indonesia and the other one in 2010, in the Deepwater Horizon highlighted again the need of a sustainable regulation of the topic. In 2012 the Comite Maritime International (CMI) constituted again a Sub-Group of study of the topic and in 2013, after the request of the Indonesian delegation the International Maritime Organization (IMO) agreed to analyze the topic. IMO conclusion was that there is no need for an international agreement, but that bilateral or regional agreements shall be reached. As there is no global convention devoted to the subject, I will study the United Nations Law Convention on the Law of the Sea ('UNCLOS, 1982') applicable provisions and several maritime and environmental international conventions in force in order to determine if they are applicable to offshore structures; namely, the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change ('UNFCC, 1992') and the Convention on Biological Biodiversity ('CBD, 1982'). In relation to this Convention, we I will also study the Aichi Biodiversity Targets, specially target 11. As regards maritime conventions, I will analyze among others, the Protocol Relating to the 1973 International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships (including Annexes, Final Act and 1973 International Convention) ('MARPOL 73/78'), the 1996 Protocol to the 1972 Convention on the Prevention of Marine Pollution by Dumping of Wastes and Other Matters ('LC 1972 and LC PROT 1996'), the 1992 Protocol to Amend the 1969 International Convention on Civil Liability for Oil Pollution Damage ('CLC 1992'), the 1990 International Convention on Oil Pollution Preparedness, Response and Co-operation ('OPRC 1990'), the 2001 International Convention on Civil Liability for Bunker Oil Pollution Damage ('Bunkers Convention'), the Hong Kong International Convention for the Safe and Environmentally Sound Recycling of Ships ('Hong Kong Convention') and the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea ('SOLAS 1974').I will also study applicable regional agreements such as the Protocol for the Protection of the Mediterranean Sea against Pollution resulting from Exploration and Exploitation of the Continental Shelf and the Seabed and its Subsoil ('Offshore Protocol') to the Convention for the Protection of the Marine Environment and the Coastal Region of the Mediterranean ('Barcelona Convention') and private agreements, such as Offshore Pollution Liability Agreement ('OPOL'). Moreover, I will analyze soft law instruments such as Rio Declaration, Agenda 21, and Sustainable Development Goals, especially Goal 14. I conclude that enacting an international convention regarding the topic negotiated with the support of IMO, UNEP and IUCN is a priority in spite of opinions on the contrary in order to mark uniformity and based in UNCLOS Sections 194 (1) and 205 (8). A strong global political will is necessary in order to achieve this aim. This international convention shall cover both fixed and mobile structures and not only compensation issues, but also application of the precautionary principle. Meanwhile, exploration and exploitation of oil and gas in the ocean is regulated by different conventions and soft law, one of its application for instance is that the relevant coastal states shall apply for Areas-to-be-Avoided, Particularly Sensitive Sea Areas (PSSA) and Special Areas (SA) to identify no-go zones and discharge restrictions.",,,,,OCEANS ConferenceOCEANS Conference,"APR 10-13, 2016APR 10-13, 2016",,"Shanghai, PEOPLES R CHINAShanghai, PEOPLES R CHINA",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,0197-7385,,978-1-4673-9724-7,,,,,,,,,"UBA, Inst Ambrosio L Gioja, CONICET, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina",,,,2016-01-01,WOS:000386521800244,,

Although these figures have been falling, offshore wind energy generation has in average still much higher costs associated with the inherent drawbacks of installing and operating assets at the sea's hostile environment. As much of these costs are related to unplanned maintenance tasks, one promising approach to make wind energy more competitive is to optimize the resources involved in it. This paper was developed with the purpose of analyzing the viability of an algorithm that offers valuable information when defining a maintenance strategy for the operation of an offshore wind faun, aiming at the availability and the expected profit optimization, with a different approach than usual. Initially, an algorithm to conduct a reliability, availability and maintainability (RAM) analysis was created based on a Monte Carlo Simulation (MCS). Given a simplified wind farm model, as well as its components' failure data and configuration, it is possible to obtain its availability and energy production costs. The algorithm was validated by comparing known failure data with the stochastically obtained after running the algorithm. A case study was defined based on extensive literature research and the simulation was executed considering restrictions typically found in modem wind farms. A sensitivity analysis was conducted in order to understand how each model's parameter affects the energy production costs. Given this analysis, it was possible to determine the most relevant optimization variables when creating a maintenance strategy. Following, an algorithm for optimizing those parameters is presented.",,,,,"36th ASME International Conference on Ocean, Offshore and Arctic Engineering36th ASME International Conference on Ocean, Offshore and Arctic Engineering","JUN 25-30, 2017JUN 25-30, 2017","ASME, Ocean Offshore & Arctic Engn DivASME, Ocean Offshore & Arctic Engn Div","Trondheim, NORWAYTrondheim, NORWAY",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,978-0-7918-5766-3,,,,,,,,,"Univ Sao Paulo, Naval Architecture & Ocean Engn Dept, Sao Paulo, Brazil",,,,2017-12-27,WOS:000417224700021,,

Attractiveness of the artificial seaweed to stone bream, striped pigfish and leather fish seemed to depend on the number of sheaf, rather than the length of the tape. It was shown that the attraction of common sea bass to the polyethylene tape depended on both the length of tape and number of sheaf. The best attraction of stone bream was observed when a sheaf of the tape was put at each corner of 1 m sq., while for common sea bass the best attraction was observed when 4 sheafs were put close together. Attraction of a single tape for leather fish and stone bream depended on both the length and width of the tape. When the artificial reefs were furnished with sheafs of polyethylene tape its attractiveness for leather fish as about 4 times greater than the bare artificial reefs. Red sea bream was hardly attracted by the polyethylene tape. || ABSTRACT AUTHORS: Authors",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1966-01-01,BCI:BCI19674800032019,,

To mitigate this impact, Ecopetrol entered into alliances with private and government institutions to initiate an integrative artificial reef project in Pozos Colorados Bay. To develop the project's framework, it was necessary to (1) establish context and objectives, (2) design plans and reef construction, (3) strengthen a target social population, and (4) conduct pre- and postdeployment ecological assessments. The achievement of each objective was met with delays and constraints, mainly due to administrative issues and legal requirements. Nevertheless, interventions and interactions among representatives of the 10 institutions involved in the project, as well as the strong commitment of fishers from three organizations in all stages of the process, were indicators of project's success. Together, these actions and contributions resulted in the deployment of the first six artificial reefs in a 137-ha area. Moreover, recorded changes in biological assemblages before and after reef deployment (richness: 3-37 species; abundance: 30.3-1,615.7 individuals), along with the presence of commercial, ecological, and endangered important species, support the concept of habitat enhancement procedures used here as a strategy for biodiversity conservation with potential for ecotourism activities. The utilization of this technology should be conducted in compliance with concerted schemes for coastal resource management and precautionary principles, directed towards the conformation of discrete marine reserves as future models of sustainable production in sensitive areas.",,,,,Symposium on Marine Artificial Reef Research and Development: Integrating Fisheries Management ObjectivesSymposium on Marine Artificial Reef Research and Development: Integrating Fisheries Management Objectives,"AUG 22-23, 2017AUG 22-23, 2017",,"Tampa, FLTampa, FL",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,0892-2284,,978-1-934874-51-6,,,,,,,,,"MoAm SAS, Calle 87 2-53 Of,101 Bocasalinas, Pozos Colorados 470006, Santa Marta, ColombiaEcopetrol SA, Terminal Pozos Colorados 470006, Santa Marta, Colombia",MoAm SAS,,,2019-02-13,WOS:000456750700013,,

However, such sources of energy are not without drawbacks, given that their installation, operation and decommissioning may potentially cause damage to and threaten the marine environment. It is therefore important to achieve a balance between the environmental benefits of using of the oceans and the need for protection of the environment.Scientific uncertainty and lack of initial data on the potential effects of these facilities, have led to long delays in processing Environmental Impact Assessments, and public opposition to these projects has contributed to stagnation in terms of its development in Spain. Furthermore, incomplete environmental impact studies and inappropriate environmental impact statements (such as those that fail to assess the synergistic effects of nearby facilities and all components thereof) can lead to delays in processing applications, the inadmissibility of wind projects, and ineffective protection of the marine environment.The current regulations on Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA)-along with case-law decisions-, are an attempt to solve several of these varied problems and clashes of interests between promoters, citizens, and administrators, while protecting biodiversity and fighting climate change. However, some regulatory gaps and legal uncertainties still require regulatory improvement in this respect.The main objective of this research is therefore to assess the real and potential future legal and factual problems in the field of environmental assessment associated with offshore wind farms in Spain, in an analysis of the responses and solutions provided by the Directive 2014/52/EU and the 21/2013 Environmental Assessment Law. Regulatory improvements are proposed, which could help to boost the development of marine renewable energy facilities, promoting greater public consensus, while at the same time protecting biodiversity and the marine environment.The main proposed improvements consist of establishing a joint or coordinated processing of ETA with other assessments and procedures (such as the evaluations derived from birds and habitats directives); elaborating guidance documents which help promoters in analyzing synergistic and cumulative effects in their Environmental Impact Studies, hereafter EIS; enhancing the role of the scoping phase and, specially, considering the inclusion of this stage in the regulation of the simplified EIA procedure; improving public information and participation in the EIA process through the establishment of the obligation of disseminate relevant information through electronic means, the expansion of the legal concept of interested persons and the inclusion of public participation phases both in early stages of the procedure and after substantial modifications of the project or the study of EIA.",,,,,,,,,13,0,0,0,1,0,13,,,0964-5691,1873-524X,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Vigo, Environm Phys Lab, Campus As Lagoas S-N, Orense 32004, SpainUniv A Coruna, Observ Litoral, La Coruna, Spain",,,,2018-12-28,WOS:000437057200018,,

This paper presented an optimization model for the scheduling of short term maintenance scheduling in offshore wind field, the optimization model belongs to nonlinear optimization problem with constraints, and uses the Gurobi to solve the optimization problem with the minimum wind field maintenance cost and the minimum wind power loss.",,,,,2nd International Conference on Sustainable Energy and Environmental Engineering (SEEE)2nd International Conference on Sustainable Energy and Environmental Engineering (SEEE),"DEC 18-19, 2016DEC 18-19, 2016",,"Xiamen, PEOPLES R CHINAXiamen, PEOPLES R CHINA",3,0,0,0,0,0,3,,,2475-8833,,978-1-60595-408-0,,,,,,,,,"Cent Res Inst Ltd Share Ltd, Shanghai Elect Grp, Shanghai, Peoples R ChinaUniv Cincinnati, Ctr Intelligent Maintenance Syst, Cincinnati, OH 45221 USA",,,,2016-01-01,WOS:000406672100002,,

Wind offshore projects are characterized by the need to build offshore electric power transmission infrastructure. Offshore substations are a key element of submarine electric power transmission systems. Due to the environmental conditions, an offshore substation is constructed as an indoor facility located on a platform. Depending on the offshore wind farm capacity, there are various solutions for platform and substructure designs used for the substation. Numerous economic and technical analyses indicate a significant potential for the development of offshore wind energy in Poland. By 2030, this potential is set at 6 GW of installed capacity, taking into account 2.2 GW of power included in the connection agreements being concluded. The main objective of this paper is to present the prospects for the development of offshore wind energy in Poland, and to describe the various offshore substation solutions and the different aspects of substation operation.

Zhejiang province, which provides high quality habitats for many marine organisms and has numerous islands waters, colonizes hundreds of species (such as fish, shrimp, shellfish, algae ect.) in the waters. Zhejiang sea waters are nutrient prosperous area, being rich in marine primary productivity, and have a wide range of flow lines and water masses between the turn of the intersection of growth and decline. But after a large-scale over-intense blind fishing, fisheries resources in the waters are recession seriously, the marine environment also have been damage. In order to improve the ecological environment quality, and to conserve fishery resources of Zhejiang coastal fishing grounds, the local governments of Shengsi county had begun to implement artificial reef construction projects, and then the project was going to be planning in 2003. The first phase of the project was successfully implemented at the end of 2004, including different types of concrete artificial reefs and vessel-reefs with a total volume of 14 985 cubic meters deployed in the middle of Dongku and Luhua sea area (30 degrees 47'-30 degrees 49'N, 122 degrees 39'-122 degrees 41'E) from 2005 to the early year of 2006, with a total reef monomer of 554. Marine environment quality might be significant changed after deploying so many artificial reefs. So far, domestic research focused mainly on the three major benefits, site selection, layout, leisure fisheries, proliferation of resources and so on, however, very few relevant impacts on nutrients and water quality after artificial reef construction is reported. Moreover, understanding and grasping the nutrient content, distribution and its impact factors were of great significance to scientific evaluation and forecasting capacity of the area and nutrition status, marine environmental protection, utilization and management. Based on the experimental data from 11 voyages carried out in Shengsi artificial reef areas and near waters in 2003-2007, the seasonal variations of nitrogen, phosphorus and water quality after the deployment of artificial reefs were studied in comparative ways between artificial reef areas and control areas, and the assessment for water quality were discussed. The results show that the majority of inorganic nitrogen is in the threshold or below the minimum threshold, and the content of active phosphate is over standard seriously. The value of N/P is in the range of 0.6280-6.7635. The water quality in Shengsi artificial reef area is nitrogen restriction, dissolve oxygen is not the limiting factor in the areas. The ecological effects could not be reflected in the short term after the deployment of artificial reefs. The water quality of the artificial reef area is better than the control area. The enrichment strength for P is greater than N in the waters, and the impact of artificial reef construction on regenerated production is significant and have lower contribution to new production.",,,,,,,,,4,18,0,0,4,0,22,,,1000-3207,,,,,,,,,,,"Marine and Fisheries Res Inst Zhejiang Prov, Zhoushan 316100, Peoples R China",,,,2010-01-01,BCI:BCI201000458753,,

Unfortunately, very little is known of hydrodynamic aspects of settlement in such habitats. Based on flow-tank experiments and theoretical considerations, we discuss hydrodynamic interference with settlement of larvae on protruding-body habitats. We suggest that larvae may overcome these interferences by producing mucous threads up to 100 body lengths in size. These adhesive threads enable propagules of suspension feeders to settle in environments of high food-particle flux and low sedimentation rate. The results suggest that hydrodynamic impediments to encounter play a major role in determining the spatial distribution of benthic species on protruding bodies by favoring propagules of species with such adhesive devices.",,,,,,,,,47,0,0,0,25,1,52,,,0024-3590,,,,,,,,,,,"TEL AVIV UNIV,DEPT ZOOL,IL-69978 TEL AVIV,ISRAELTECHNION ISRAEL INST TECHNOL,FAC AEROSP ENGN,HAIFA,ISRAEL",,,,1994-01-01,WOS:A1994NC77800017,,

A total of 51 fine-scale surveys and 474 d of hydrophone deployment at 2 stations were analysed by partial least squares regression and spatial modelling in relation to synoptic (spatio-temporal) data derived from a local, high-resolution hydrodynamic model. Small-scale changes in local currents reflecting upwelling driven by the interaction of the semi-diurnal tidal currents with the steep slopes of the bank were the Main habitat driver identified from the acoustic as well as the survey data. Spatial modelling based on selected key predictor variables showed the distribution of harbour porpoises to alternate between 2 upwelling cells depending on the direction of tidal currents. The size of upwelling cells was less than 10 km, matching the small-scale spatial structure of survey data as revealed by geostatistical analysis.

The aim of this paper is to use synthetic aperture radar (SAR) and medium resolution imaging spectrometer (MERIS) onboard the environmental satellite (ENVISAT) in synergy to analyze severe weather systems, in particular, to describe the spatial evolution of the atmospheric boundary layer processes involved in cold air outbreaks. We investigated the fine-scale structure of a severe weather case on November 1, 2006 over the North Sea using satellite data. The satellite data are compared with numerical model results of the German Weather Service Lokal Modell (1,M) and the high-resolution limited area model (HIRLAM). LM and HIRLAM show differences in mesoscale turbulent behavior and coastal shadowing. Maximum wind speeds of up to 25 m/s are measured by SAR and are confirmed by the models. Significant differences are observed in the location of the maxima. High-resolution ENVISAT ASAR measurements provide very detailed information on small-scale atmospheric features, which seem to not be captured well by the analyzed numerical models, in particular, in coastal areas.

An economic and efficient maintenance strategy is essential to govern the normal running of port infrastructures and thus seaborne transportation. Many agencies worldwide have managed to develop maintenance strategies to ensure optimal levels of serviceability and safety for port infrastructures. However, there is not much information about how sustainable issues can be implemented in the maintenance planning. This paper proposes a methodology for evaluating, comparing and improving sustainability of maintenance strategies for port infrastructures. The method is developed based on a proposed randomized structural deterioration model. The costs due to retrofitting, operating loss and environmental loss are considered in the total life cycle cost estimation. The concept of utility function is utilized to serve as a criterion for finding the optimal strategy among the alternative maintenance strategies. An investigation is performed on a Tokyo wharf to demonstrate the proposed approach. The maintenance strategies for different structural elements in the port infrastructures are discussed. The results show that the proposed approach can provide more reliable information on the maintenance timing. The predicted cost bounds allow owners risk managers to understand the current condition of the structure in several ways, which include both safe-side prediction and average prediction.

Here, we analyze a long-term, large-scale observational dataset to characterize the dynamics of the species' recent northward range shift along the coast of Catalonia and examine the main factors that could have influenced this spread. The variation in the distributional range of Oculina patagonica was examined by monitoring 223 locations including natural and artificial habitats along >400 km of coastline over the last 19 years (1992-2010). Abundance of the species increased from being present in one location in 1992 to occur on 19% of the locations in 2010, and exhibited an acceleration of its spreading over time driven by the join action of neighborhood and long-distance dispersal. However, the pattern of spread diverged between artificial and natural habitats. A short lag phase and a high slope on the exponential phase characterized the temporal pattern of spread on artificial habitats in contrast to that observed on natural ones. Northward expansion has occurred at the fastest rate (22 km year(-1)) reported for a coral species thus far, which is sufficiently fast to cope with certain climate warming predictions. The pattern of spread suggests that this process is mediated by the interplay of (i) the availability of open space provided by artificial habitats, (ii) the seawater temperature increase with the subsequent extension of the growth period, and (iii) the particular biological features of O. patagonica (current high growth rates, early reproduction, and survival to low temperature and in polluted areas).

We introduce the cloud model and adaptive Gaussian cloud transformation (A-GCT) algorithm to grade indicators and apply BN to achieve nonlinear integration and inference of multi-indicators. Combined with the fuzzy representation of the cloud model and probabilistic reasoning of BN, the proposed model can investigate the most efficient siting areas of OWFs in the North Sea of Europe.

While biofouling on marine energy conversion devices on one hand has the potential to be an engineering concern, these structures can also affect biodiversity by functioning as artificial reefs. The Lysekil Project is a test park for wave power located at the Swedish west coast. Here, buoys acting as point absorbers on the surface are connected to generators anchored on concrete foundations on the seabed. In this study we investigated the colonisation of foundations by invertebrates and fish, as well as fouling assemblages on buoys. We examined the influence of surface orientation of the wave power foundations on epibenthic colonisation, and made observations of habitat use by fish and crustaceans during three years of submergence. We also examined fouling assemblages on buoys and calculated the effects of biofouling on the energy absorption of the wave power buoys. On foundations we demonstrated a succession in colonisation over time with a higher degree of coverage on vertical surfaces. Buoys were dominated by the blue mussel Mytilus edulis. Calculations indicated that biofouling have no significant effect in the energy absorption on a buoy working as a point absorber.

The chlorophyll a concentration was from 0.22 to 9.46 mu g/L, Shannon index (log(2)) (H') was from 0.76 to 3.06, and Pielou index (J') was from 0.28 to 0.77. Seawater environmental factors had minor changes before and after the construction of artificial reefs, and there was no significant difference within and outside the reefs area. Following the construction, Pb and Hg were reduced, making the increase of samples that fitting for the first grade sea water. Chlorophyll a, H' and J' were decreased after the reef construction, but there was no significant difference in chlorophyll a concentration within and outside the reefs area, and the H' and J' inside the reefs area were higher than those in the outside. The dominant species show minor changes, but no significant difference between the inner and outer reefs area. Melosira sulcata was the dominant specie in this sea area throughout the survey. The canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) shows that, instead of the construction of artificial reefs, the most important factor affecting the distribution of stations and phytoplankton species is seasonal variations. The phytoplankton community was mainly affected by dissolved oxygen, NO3-N, water temperature, suspended solids and As. Although the concentration of As was well up to the national standards of the first grade of China, the distribution of phytoplankton community was significantly influenced by As.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,1000-9620,1000-9620,,,,,,,,,,"Minist Transport, Key Lab Environm Protect Technol Water Transport, Tianjin Res Inst Water Transport Engn, Tianjin 300456, Peoples R China",,,,2021-03-14,BCI:BCI202100294139,,

Floated gravity base structures (GBSs), which use the buoyancy of the structure instead of using heavy lift vessels during the transport and installation process, are receiving much attention. The main difference between the floated GBS and conventional structures is a design based on floating stability. A floated GBS should maintain floating stability on its own until it is lowered onto the seabed. Therefore, the concept design of the floated GBS is derived to satisfy the minimum metacentric height of 0.75 m during the lowering operation in the installation. As floated GBSs are ballasted with sea water during installation, free surface effects and bulkheads are also taken into account. In regard to the model with a conical base, designs with minimum weights are presented by varying the batter angle of the base. In addition, the maximum load at the bottom of each design is analyzed to assess the bearing capacity of floated GBSs. Although the weight of the floated GBS is minimized at a batter angle of 0Â°, a batter angle larger than 30Â° is recommended in consideration of the bearing capacity.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,2093-5099,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2018-01-01,KJD:ART002363667,,

The offshore wind industry contributed 9.8% of the UK's power in the 3rd quarter of 2019. In the 2019 Offshore Wind Sector Deal, the sector committed to building up to 30 GW of offshore wind by 2030, with an ambition of increasing exports fivefold to £2.6bn. The Committee on Climate Change has recommended an installed capacity of 75 GW by 2050. Nearly all offshore wind turbines installed to date have been mounted on fixed bottom support structures located in water depths up to 60 m. Given the limited availability of suitable sites at such water depths, Floating Offshore Wind Turbines (FOWT) will become increasingly important over the next decade to achieve the Offshore Wind Sector Deal goals and to help achieve the UK target of net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. The Sector Deal highlights the need for government to develop frameworks to support the advancement of technologies such as FOWT.Physical modelling is a critical tool for the development of a floating offshore wind turbine and is recommended in most development guidelines. This is especially true at early stages of the development of new concept with a technology readiness level (TRL) between 1 and 3. Testing model devices at scale in the controlled environment of a laboratory has many advantages. These include the proof (or otherwise) of novel design concepts, the ability to test in systematically changing conditions and the ability to test in conditions which have low occurrence probabilities (i.e. extreme events). Quantitative measurements of motions and loads on scaled FOWT models can be made with much greater ease and accuracy then at full scale at sea. Qualitative observations are far easier to observe as well. If done correctly these measurements and observations can lead to the evolution of device designs and concepts and reduce the chance of costly failure; if and when devices are eventually deployed at sea.The University of Plymouth COAST laboratory (www.plymouth.ac.uk/coast-laboratory) is a state-of-the-art research facility for the study of wave and current interaction with offshore and coastal structures using scaled physical modelling. It houses the Ocean Basin, a 35 m x 15.5 m tank with a raisable floor that can enable testing at water depths between 0.5 and 3 m. This project will establish the UKFOWTT - UK Floating Offshore Wind Turbine Test facility within the Ocean Basin. In addition to the wave and current generation that COAST can presently deliver, UKFOWTT will add wind generation to COAST. This will consist of a bank of axial fans, mounted on a gantry spanning the tank width and have the ability to generate winds up to 10 m/s, model gusting and have a controllable wind profile. The generator will be moveable vertically from just at the water's surface to approximately 1 m above. It will be rotatable +/- 30 degrees relative to the basin, enabling the influence of wave/current/wind/model alignment to be investigated. The primary purpose of UKFOWTT is to enable both fundamental and applied research in topics related to Floating Offshore Wind. This will be a unique facility within the UK, enabling systematic physical modelling experiments with wind, wave and currents simultaneously. Data collected from physical modelling can improve understanding of the underlying physics, support development of analytical theories and validate advanced numerical models. It is also a low risk method of testing new and novel concepts. UKFOWTT provides the associated instrumentation to support these studies. UKFOWTT will also support research in other sectors of Ocean and Coastal Engineering disciplines, including the Oil and Gas sector, floating wave, tidal and solar energy, autonomous vessels, launch and recovery operations and coastal defenses.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,EP/V007726/1,,,,,,,,University of Plymouth,,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:15385959,,

In this research, the effect of controlling the wave and nearshore current fields by artificial reefs was studied by hydraulic model tests and numerical calcuations. In the hydraulic model tests, studies were made on how changes in the distance between dikes (opening width) and the length of dikes would affect flow patterns when installing several artificial reefs on the shore. These flow patterns were classified using the ratio of dike length to openig width. Based on this flow pattern classification, a steady circulation current was formed in nearshore current to allow inner water masses to catch larvae, making it consequently possible to prevent the dissipation of larvae. In the numerical calculations, the wave and nearshore current fields were simulated with respect to Hamanaka Bay in Hokkaido, where five artificial reefs were installed with the aim of stabilizing the habitat of shells. In the hinterland of the artificial reef, wave heights were found about 30% less than those without artificial reef. Flow velocities wave weaker than those without artificial reef, thus making it possible to prolong the retention time of larvae and promote their implantation. Flow velocities at each calculation points were lower than the critical migration velocities of shells, enabling the artificial reef to prevent shells from being washed up and proving the effectiveness of such mounds in stabilizing the habitat.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,0503-1540,,,,,,,,,,,"Department of Civil Engineering, Nagoya University, Chikusa-ku, Nagoya, 464-8603, Japan",,,,2000-08-01,BCI:BCI200100094543,,

J,,,,,,,,,Maurizio Collu,,Investigation of the novel challenges of an integrated offshore multi-purpose platform,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Awarded Grant,Jul 02 2017,2017,"The Made in China 2025 report, highlights ocean renewable energy technologies as one of the 10 areas of opportunity for UK and Chinese companies. The Outline of the National Marine Economic Development Plan specifically targets the development of novel ocean farming methods, more productive but also more socially and environmentally compatible. In the EU, the Blue Growth program aims at sustainable growth in the marine and maritime sectors, already representing 5.4 million jobs and generating a gross added value of 500 billion euros a year. Offshore structures are very costly. The main idea of a Multi-Purpose Platform (MPP), integrating (for example) renewable energy devices and aquaculture facilities, is to find the synergies to share manufacturing, installation, operation and maintenance, and decommissioning costs.This has the potential to, save money, reduce the overall impact, and maximize the socio-economic benefits.MPP development poses cross-disciplinary challenges, since they simultaneously aim to achieve several potentially conflicting objectives: to be techno-economically feasible, environmentally considered, socially beneficial, and compatible with maritime legislations. In the EU, previous research focused on farms of multi-megawatt MPP (ocean renewable devices + aquaculture systems), with very few/no attempts to investigate lower rated power systems suitable for island/coastal communities. In China, previous projects aimed at island communities focused on renewable energy, but they did not integrate any aquaculture elements.Therefore, for island communities, novel fundamental questions arise, especially in terms of techno-economic feasibility and assessment and maximization of socio-environmental benefits at a completely different scale, but still requiring a whole-system, cross-disciplinary approach.The proposed solution is to investigate which are the specific challenges arising from the integration of these different offshore technologies, and with a multi-disciplinary approach to tackle them, making sure that all the dimensions (technological, economic, social, environmental, legal) are taken into account.The renewable energy technologies (Which wind turbine? Which wave device? What kind of solar panel?) and aquaculture systems most suitable for the needs of an island community will be identified, and the cross-disciplinary questions will be defined, e.g. What is the impact of the noise generated by the renewable energy devices on the (closely co-located) aquaculture species growth rate?.Answering these questions, the novel contribution will consist in developing approaches to assess the feasibility of an MPP system, focusing on: global MPP dynamic response to metocean conditions, overall integrated control and power management strategies, environmental impact, socio-economic risks and benefits.The potential of these methodologies will be then show-cased through two case-studies, one focusing on an island community in China, and one in the UK.This consortium brings together internationally recognised experts from three Chinese and three British universities and institutes, for a total of 20 investigators, in the fields of solar and offshore wind and wave energy, control systems for renewable energy devices, environmental and socio-economic impact of renewables and aquaculture systems, aquaculture and integrated multi-trophic aquaculture development, and ecosystem modelling.

As platforms reach the end of their useful lifetime, operators and regulatory agencies will assess the environmental impact of potential decommissioning strategies. Among the many factors that will be weighed in preparation for these major economic and engineering challenges is the fate of the fish and invertebrate communities that inhabit the structures underwater. Offshore platforms act as inadvertent artificial reefs, and some are recognized among the most productive fish habitats in the global oceans. We present a model for forecasting changes to fish communities surrounding offshore installations following a series of decommissioning alternatives. Using 24 platforms off southern California, we estimate fish biomass and somatic production under three possible decommissioning scenarios: leave in place, partial removal at 26-m depth, and complete removal of the platform and underlying shell mound. We used fish density and size data from scuba and submersible surveys of the platforms from 1995-2013 to estimate biomass and annual somatic production. Bottom trawl surveys were used to characterize future fish assemblages at platform sites under the complete-removal decommissioning scenario. Based on a conservatively modeled extrapolation of the survey data, we found that complete removal of a platform resulted in 95% or more reduction in the average fish biomass and annual somatic production at the site, while partial removal resulted in far smaller losses, averaging 10% or less. In the event that all surveyed platforms are completely removed, we estimated a total loss of more than 28,000 kg of fish biomass in the Southern California Bight. Platform habitats, which attract reef-dwelling fish species, had minimal overlap in community composition with the surrounding soft-bottom habitat. To best serve the wide range of stakeholder interests, the site-specific biomass, productivity and species composition information provided in this study should be incorporated into strategic decommissioning planning.

Eco-exergy was positively related with macrobenthic biomass and abundance, confirming that the eco-exergy of the macrobenthic fauna assemblage was mainly derived from biomass information. The results of this short-term study indicate that AR construction could increase macrobenthic faunal taxonomic diversity and thermodynamic health in both AR and nearby non-reef habitats.

These '' rig-to-reef '' projects have been promoted as innovative public-private partnerships that address the dual problems of costly platform removal and disappearing fishing opportunities. I argue that the current legal framework fails to ensure habitat enhancement and may condone ocean dumping. The problem can be traced to three sources: federal and state competition on the outer continental shelf, lack of a comprehensive long-term federal vision for outer continental shelf development, and interest group pressure in the face of scientific uncertainty.

We investigated the fauna of 8 historical shipwrecks off the US east coast to assess whether species distribution patterns on the shipwrecks fit models from classical island theory. Invertebrates on the shipwrecks included both sessile (sponges, anemones, hydroids) and motile (crustaceans, echinoderms) species. Invertebrate communities were significantly different among wrecks. The size and distance between wrecks influenced the biotic communities, much like on terrestrial islands. However, while wreck size influenced species richness (alpha diversity), distance to the nearest wreck influenced community composition (beta diversity). Alpha and beta diversity on the shipwrecks were thus influenced by different abiotic factors. We found no evidence of either nested patterns or nonrandom co-occurrence of morphotypes, suggesting that the taxa on a given shipwreck were randomly selected from the available taxon pool. Species present on the shipwrecks generally had 1 of 2 reproductive modes: most motile or solitary sessile species had long-duration planktotrophic larvae, while most encrusting or colonial sessile species had short-duration lecithotrophic larvae and underwent asexual reproduction by budding as adults. Short-duration larvae may recruit to their natal shipwreck, allowing them to build up dense populations and dominate the wreck surfaces. A high degree of dominance was indeed observed on the wrecks, with up to 80% of the fauna being accounted for by the most common species alone. By comparing the shipwreck communities to known patterns of succession in shallow water, we hypothesize that the shipwrecks are in a stage of mid-succession.",,,,,,,,,18,0,0,0,11,0,18,,,0171-8630,1616-1599,,,,,,,,,,"Oregon Inst Marine Biol, Charleston, OR 97420 USAFlorida State Univ, Coastal & Marine Lab, St Teresa, FL 32358 USAHeriot Watt Univ, Lyell Ctr Earth & Marine Sci & Technol, Edinburgh EH14 4AP, Midlothian, ScotlandWoods Hole Oceanog Inst, Woods Hole, MA 02543 USA",Oregon Inst Marine Biol,,,2017-04-05,WOS:000396051300002,,

The effects of fish and shellfish farming on sessile wild populations, particularly infauna, have been studied intensively. Mobile fauna, including crustaceans, fish, birds and marine mammals, also interact with aquaculture operations, but the interactions are more complex and these animals may be attracted to (attraction) or show an aversion to (repulsion) farm operations with various degrees of effects. This review outlines the main mechanisms and effects of attraction and repulsion of wild animals to/from marine finfish cage and bivalve aquaculture, with a focus on effects on fisheries-related species. Effects considered in this review include those related to the provision of physical structure (farm infrastructure acting as fish aggregating devices (FADs) or artificial reefs (ARs), the provision of food (e.g. farmed animals, waste feed and faeces, fouling organisms associated with farm structures) and some farm activities (e.g. boating, cleaning). The reviews show that the distribution of mobile organisms associated with farming structures varies over various spatial (vertical and horizontal) and temporal scales (season, feeding time, day/night period). Attraction/repulsion mechanisms have a variety of direct and indirect effects on wild organisms at the level of individuals and populations and may have implication for the management of fisheries species and the ecosystem in the context of marine spatial planning. This review revealed considerable uncertainties regarding the long-term and ecosystem-wide consequences of these interactions.

Because of the potential applications of artificial reefs for fisheries, particular attention was paid to commercially valuable species. In October 1990, hollow (30 cm)(3) concrete blocks with 20 cm diameter openings on their six sides were arranged in two layers to form 0.6 m high reefs of 0.81 m(2) basal area. Five of these reefs were deployed at depths of 13 to 18 m on sandy and rubble bottoms. Colonization and community development was quantitatively recorded using SCUBA. Three major faunal groups-fish, crustaceans, and sea urchins-increased their abundance on the reefs. Commercially valuable species included adults of two crabs: Cancer edwardsi and Homalaspis plana. The reefs also served as recruiting sites for juvenile rockfish (Sebastes capensis) and as feeding and courtship arenas for tripterygids (Tripterygion cunninghami). A few other crab and fish species also appeared in and around the reefs but without becoming residents. Algal colonization was slow and their abundance was notably controlled by sea urchins (Arbacia dufresnei). Artificial habitats placed on low-relief bottoms of the Channel Region of Southern Chile can potentially enhance the abundance of some commercially valuable species. The effect of artificial reefs on species richness (especially fish) was not striking, however.

The research efforts will be anchored by the University of Massachusetts Lowell as the lead institution, partnering with Texas A&M, the University of Texas at Dallas, and Iowa State University. Wind energy systems for electricity production are complex engineered systems that operate on land or over water to produce usable power. These systems consist of an array of wind turbines placed on appropriate support structures and interconnected to deliver electric power to the utility grid. The potential for land-based and offshore wind energy is tremendous, but to achieve this potential will require a coherent and industry-relevant research and development program that involves industry, academe and government. The proposed I/UCRC will address industrially relevant research to advance and support the development of wind energy systems with low-cost energy and high reliability. The partners intend to engage in a cooperative program of research and education in the following areas: A) Composites in Wind Energy, B) Foundations and Towers, C) Manufacturing and Design, D) Structural Health Monitoring, Non-Destructive Inspection, and Testing,E) Control Systems and Storage, and F) Wind System Planning, Siting, Operations, and Maintenance. The proposed center will provide a forum in which wind turbine manufacturers, manufacturers of key components, suppliers of ancillary equipment, service companies, and wind project developers can work together to solve problems that are of mutual interest. In addition, the center will work to develop and integrate educational activities that enhance recruitment and retention of diverse student populations. The Center intends to collaborate with KidWind, which provides teaching materials for K-12 teachers, and manages regional and national challenges for team turbine design competitions. The center will provide a conduit for the transfer of ideas among KidWind, industry, and academe and will engage industrial partners to develop regional training programs between educators and industry to create a sustainable pipeline of future STEM workers with strong interest by women and underrepresented groups.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,1238185,,,,,,,,Iowa State University,,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:13523358,,

We found that oil and gas platforms off the coast of California have the highest secondary fish production per unit area of seafloor of any marine habitat that has been studied, about an order of magnitude higher than fish communities from other marine ecosystems. Most previous estimates have come from estuarine environments, generally regarded as one of the most productive ecosystems globally. High rates of fish production on these platforms ultimately result from high levels of recruitment and the subsequent growth of primarily rockfish (genus Sebastes) larvae and pelagic juveniles to the substantial amount of complex hardscape habitat created by the platform structure distributed throughout the water column. The platforms have a high ratio of structural surface area to seafloor surface area, resulting in large amounts of habitat for juvenile and adult demersal fishes over a relatively small footprint of seafloor.

Using an array of 28 artificial reefs supporting transplants of a dominant canopy-forming kelp (Ecklonia radiata) representing 7 patch sizes (0.12-7.68 m(2)) crossed with 4 kelp densities (0-16 ind. m(-2)), we determined how differences in the patch size and density of this ecosystem engineer influenced the associated understorey assemblages, including the abundance of turf algae, foliose algae and sessile invertebrates. We then determined how abiotic and biotic factors modified by E. radiata related to the abundance of these functional groups and E. radiata recruitment. Decreasing patch size and absence of kelp led to the proliferation of turfs, whilst foliose algae and invertebrates were dominant on larger reefs with kelp, where intermediate densities of kelp supported the highest abundance of foliose algae. We postulate that benthic light was the most important factor positively influencing turf cover, which in turn suppressed foliose algae. Adverse effects of light and sediment deposition best explained the cover of invertebrates. Contrary to expectation, understorey species had little effect on the density of E. radiata recruits, which instead was strongly correlated with the abundance of transplanted kelp on each reef. These results highlight the capacity of E. radiata to influence major functional groups within the sub-canopy via abiotic ecosystem engineering and through control of turfs and indicate that the negative effect of understorey algae on kelp recruitment may be context specific.",,,,,,,,,10,0,0,0,10,0,11,,,0171-8630,1616-1599,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Tasmania, Inst Marine & Antarctic Studies, Hobart, Tas 7004, Australia",,,,2020-04-06,WOS:000521189100005,,

Four fish were manually tracked from the surface overnight, and their positions were recorded every hour for either 9 or 16 h. The total length of fish tagged was 589 +/- 14 mm (mean +/- SE). The number of detections by the remote receivers was 290,340 +/- 44,696. By the end of this study, 5 fish were still being tracked, 8 fish had been lost immediately after tagging, 15 fish had been caught by fishers, and 26 fish had been lost after extended tracking. Red snapper were resident on artificial reefs for 218 +/- 28 d, and residence time ranged from 1 to 595 d. We estimated that most (67%) of the tagged red snapper showed long-term residence (117-595 d), 13% were resident for 8-91 d, and 20% left the tagging site soon after release (< 4 d). Fish were resident on the same artificial reef over all seasons (winter, spring, summer, and fall), and no seasonal changes in proximity to the reef were detected. Red snapper left the receiver range (1.6 km) for short time periods; for example, fish 25 left the reef 285 times for 1-4 h over a 335-d period. However, all fish spent most of their time (98%) within the receiver range. We detected diet changes in proximity to the reefs (N = 8), but patterns varied.

There is historical evidence that the coast has undergone important morphologic evolution in the past resulting in a more regular coastline with few indentations.Within the framework of a sustainable coastal management, the Portuguese Coast Authority launched a programme to may the land at risk on the coast. The idea is not new and has been in the law since 1971. The time is opportune. Since 1993, several management plans have been developed for coastal stretches, covering the entire coast, and data and relevant material about the coast collected in the meantime.For mapping proposes and due to the length of the coast a division was made in coastal stretches that correspond approximately to the littoral cells that can be identified. Natural features and man made structures were used to define littoral cells. Ten littoral cells were identified on the coast. This methodology proved successful because most of the erosion problems are related to the littoral drift and the analysis should consider the whole of a cell.When identifying land at risk three main threats were considered: erosion, flooding and dune migration. Coastal erosion is particularly important in soft low-laying coastal stretches in the west coast. In some locations severe erosion rates, higher than 10 m/yr, were measured based on the comparison of coastline position at different dates. Some cases of land prone to flooding were also identified. Dune migration proved not to be a real threat in the Portuguese coast.The maps were constructed using ESRI products Arcinfo/Arcview to import material from different sources and formats. The analysis and interpretation for mapping the land at risk was done taking into account: the morphology of the coast, the geology, the coastline orientation, the natural protections, the local wave climate, the past events, the evolution trends and the field work. The threats are classified in three categories: low, medium and high. The presence of most of the coastal protection structures were considered in the mapping exercise.The maps of land at risk are delivered in CD-ROM using a Digital Map Publishing Service from IDS-Information Delivery Service. To view the maps absolutely no GIS or mapping experience or knowledge is needed.

This reef is unprecedented in terms of both its size and its focus on providing habitat for giant kelp. To derive a set of design specifications that should guarantee persistent kelp populations, we addressed issues of what substrates could be used, how large these substrates should be, how high they should be piled, and how they should be distributed. The design study included a review of the historical distribution of kelp on artificial reefs in Southern California, a survey of the natural substrate types that have supported persistent populations, and a comparison of survival on different size classes of rocks. The conclusion is that a low relief reef with a moderate level of sand cover would be the most likely candidate for a successful kelp reef.

Consequently, the water flows around MFARs are important in predicting the spreading pattern and obviously estimating the corresponding wake region is essential. In this study, we present the wake volumes of seven MFARs and associated flow characteristics, such as efficiency and unit propagation indices, and finally recommended better placement models, optimizing the interaction between ARs and the corresponding wake volumes. From the demonstrations, it was found that the indices were sensitive to facilitated AR modules, adapted AR size, and mixed use of different AR modules.

Notably, most of the previous studies have idealised the considered ice floe as an infinite or semi-infinite thin plate resting on a Winkler-type elastic foundation. However, a typical ice field in the Arctic is far from continuous. Furthermore, recent Arctic offshore structures have usually been designed with support from ice management; i.e., these sloping structures are most often operating in a broken ice field and are interacting with ice floes of finite sizes. Bearing this loading environment in mind, this paper starts with the question 'What are the physical processes behind the failure of a finite size ice floe interacting with a sloping structure, and what will the failure pattern look like?' Based on an in-depth literature review in relation to out-of-plane failures of infinite and semi-infinite ice floes, depending on the floe sizes, we propose a conservative classification of an ice floe's out-of-plane failures under an edge load, i.e., 1) finite size ice floes that are broken at radial crack initiation and 2) a semi-infinite ice floe that is broken by sequentially forming radial and circumferential cracks. Between these two scenarios, we focused our study on 'radial-crack-initiation-controlled fracture' of a finite size ice floe. Specifically, we are trying to answer the following question: 'how small/large should an ice floe be to be treated as a finite size/semi-infinite ice floe?' Based on a series of assumptions, radial crack initiation and propagation within a square ice floe were theoretically formulated and numerically studied. The respective loads to initiate and propagate a radial crack have been extracted and compared to quantify the required size smaller than which an ice floe would fail at radial crack initiation. For typical ice material properties, it is theoretically illustrated that a nearly square shaped ice floe can fail at crack initiation if its physical size is smaller than approximately 27 x (ice thickness)(3/4). On the theoretical side, this paper contributes to the derivation of non-dimensional formulae to study radial crack initiation and propagation. Additionally, simplified yet effective numerical models to study radial crack initiation and propagation within an ice floe were proposed and validated. On the practical side, the research methodologies and conclusions presented herein shed light on the possibility of a more economic design for an Arctic offshore structure whose major operating environment is filled with finite size ice floes. In addition, because the 'radial-crack-initiation-controlled fracture' of an ice floe means a much smaller ice load (i.e., compared with continuous circumferential type bending failure within a level ice environment) on a sloping structure, it is recommended, from a mechanically preferred point of view, that floes with sizes smaller than 27 x (ice thickness)(3/4) should be produced in the downstream of an ice management operation.

In the quantitative study, factors such as species characteristics (ecological type), attractiveness (relationship between fish and diver) and abundance of fish communities around the artificial reefs appear to influence our results on the comparison of the two techniques. Of 13 'permanent' (observed in more than 75% of dives) species, 6 returned a similar frequency of detection by slate and video (Lutjanus kasmira, Lutjanus bengalensis, Priacanthus hamrur, Chaetodon kleinii, Heniochus diphreutes, Mulloides vanicolensis); these were then selected for comparison of the techniques using quantitative data. The correlation between video and slate census results is high, but, in comparison with the slate census, the video census underestimates abundance, especially for low values. A corrected index is proposed to remedy this underestimation; it could be used for video surveys conducted on species responding well to video detection (as below). (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V.

In particular, the Dodecanese Islands of the Aegean Sea cover their electricity needs mostly on the basis of autonomous conventional stations, consuming significant quantities of imported oil annually. Renewable energy sources (RES) penetration increase addresses the global requirements towards a carbon neutral environment, and wind farms (WFs) are among the most well-known green electricity-production alternatives. The study explores wind power installation potential of the Dodecanese Islands and the storage or interconnection options, based on the national and European legislative framework and the international scientific literature. The major finding is that, due to the high wind potential of the area, the National policy and targets focus on the installation of great RES power at Greek islands. Hence, private interests, who are willing to carry out the electrical interconnection of islands to the mainland, serve the same objective.

Therefore, similar human disturbance analyses are necessary for these transformed marine environments, but the lack of accurate, accessible, and up-to-date location information about these spatially dispersed changes significantly limits examination of their environmental impacts. Subsequently these dynamic changes across the oceans are poorly documented.

In the UK there are statutory needs to monitor seabirds at sea, particularly in light of new offshore areas being designated for conservation and plans for major offshore wind farm developments. However, the extent to which at-sea surveys are capable of detecting changes in abundance and options for improving survey protocols have received little attention. We investigate the power of detecting changes in numbers using at-sea surveys. Using data collected as part of a visual aerial seabird survey programme that covered areas of 'Round 2' offshore wind farm developments in UK waters, we quantify the variability and characterize the statistical properties of count data. By generating random datasets with the same properties as real data, we estimated the power of being able to detect various declines (50, 33, 25, 15 and 10%) and assessed the effects of survey duration and frequency and of spatial scale and variability in bird numbers. The results indicate that the survey design protocols used for the UK 'Round 2' offshore wind farm visual aerial seabird survey programme do not provide adequate means of detecting changes in numbers, even when declines are in excess of 50% and assumptions regarding certainty are relaxed to < 80%. Extending the duration, frequency and spatial extent of surveys would increase the probability of detecting changes, but not to a desirable level (e. g. > 0.8). The primary reason why there is a low probability of being able to detect consistent directional changes is that seabird numbers fluctuate greatly at any given location. Means of explaining this fine-scale variability are required, especially if small changes in populations are to be detected. Incorporating hydrodynamic variables into trend analysis might increase the power of detecting changes. Failure to detect changes in seabird numbers should not be taken to mean that no changes are occurring.",,,,,,,,,29,0,0,0,22,0,35,,,0019-1019,1474-919X,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Exeter, Environm & Sustainabil Inst, Penryn TR10 9EZ, Cornwall, EnglandThe Nunnery, British Trust Ornithol, Thetford IP24 2PU, Norfolk, EnglandDanish Hydraul Inst, DK-2970 Horsholm, Denmark",,,,2013-01-01,WOS:000316326600011,,

Using semi-structured interviews with SSFs and analytical literature reviews on small-scale fisheries, it is found that Poland's MSP is cast against a contentious history of marine resource management that shapes negative perceptions of and attitudes towards both the European Union-mediated MSP and marine scientists. Notably, SSFs believe that (1) authorities often undervalue and underutilize their experiential knowledge, (2) MSP is intended primarily to facilitate the siting of offshore wind farms and, (3) scientific knowledge is either not effectively communicated or is at the service of investors. A discussion follows that proposes measures through which planners can ensure procedural fairness.

This negative perception, combined with the increased role (and statutory requirement) for public consultation in the granting of licences, means that artificial reef projects are greatly assisted by a structured approach to planning and consultation early in the developmental process. At present, a statutory framework governing reef construction within Europe has not been agreed, but new guidelines were issued in 1998 under the auspices of the Oslo Paris Commission. The Loch Linnhe Artificial Reef is a large-scale reef complex being constructed on the west coast of Scotland and intended for research purposes. It was the first artificial reef application to be successful under the new guidelines and therefore has particular relevance to any reef development occurring within Europe and, more generically, worldwide. The licensing process was assisted by open dialogue with a range of user groups and local bodies. Early and constructive consultation within a formal management structure impressed local government and licensing agencies, facilitated informed debate, and greatly enhanced the public's understanding of complex issues related to artificial reef construction.

There was a general increment in tow duration, landing weights, and discard weights from west to east. The most important species by catch weight was cod, for which highest catches were obtained during spring in ICES subdivision 25. Single hauls exceeded 25 h and caught more than 9900 kg of cod.

The relationship among the sub-contractors is complex because of the perception of losing business if they cooperate with their competitors.

J,,,,,,,,,Jennifer Loxton,,Marine Renewable Energy Directed KE Fellowship: Biofouling in the UK Marine Renewable Energy Industry,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Awarded Grant,Sep 30 2017,2017,"When man-made structures, such as marine renewable energy devices, are deployed in the sea they are quickly colonised by communities of organisms growing on exposed surfaces. This marine growth, or biofouling, is often unwanted from an engineering perspective and can have consequences for structural integrity, efficiency, maintenance and functioning of devices. Non-native species are also commonly found on man-made structures, making biofouling a potential biosecurity risk and a possible vector for species invasions. Factors such as the type of species in the biofouling community, the geographical location and the seasonality of organism settlement and growth lead to a high degree of variability in biofouling properties such as mass, thickness and texture. At the moment marine renewable energy SME's conduct most of their design, efficiency calculations and maintenance planning based on very basic figures for biofouling thickness which do not take into account variability. Technical standards acknowledge the limitations of existing guidance and recommend that whenever possible, site-specific measurements should be used. Unfortunately, due to the newness of the industry, this data is often not available and SMEs and engineers are working with little more than a best guess when calculating for the effects of marine growth on devices.Jen Loxton recently co-hosted a workshop which discussed biofouling on marine renewable energy devices with attendees spanning academia, regulatory bodies, and industry. Together this group identified 119 issues associated with biofouling with operational, financial or environmental impacts. A key priority which was identified to help solve many of these issues was improved knowledge exchange between science, engineering and marine industry. It was acknowledged that there is a lot of biofouling knowledge in the scientific and industrial communities but there is currently no pathway for getting this to the right people to inform renewable energy device design and maintenance decisions. It is this gap in communication which Jen aims to address in this KE project.During the fellowship Jen will develop and launch a comprehensive online resource which will consolidate biofouling science in an accessible and industry relevant format for the UK marine renewable energy community. This resource will consist of:- A website of biofouling knowledge, translated for industry- An interactive tool/app powered by a database of UK biofouling distribution and characteristicsThe website will provide a biofouling one-stop-shop for stakeholders associated with the UK marine renewable energy industry and help to inform engineering and operational decisions and increase awareness of potential environmental considerations. It is anticipated that it will increase the reach and impact of biofouling science.A comprehensive database will be populated with biofouling science and species distribution data and will power the interactive tool/app. A user would specify location, deployment type and available observations of biofouling and the tool will generate a tailored suite of industrially relevant statistics and possible management techniques. Full specifications for the tool will be determined during the fellowship but examples of possible outputs include maximum biomass, thickness and rugosity of fouling, expected seasonal variations and known non-native species in the vicinity. The database will continue to grow during the life of the fellowship and beyond through live links with UK databases (e.g. NBN gateway) and the addition of user specified biofouling observations.Information for the fellowship will be gathered from academia, regulatory bodies and from across the maritime industries, including oil & gas, shipping, leisure boating and the aquaculture industries. The fellow will include data from previous NERC projects (e.g. EBAO and FlowBec), expanding the impact of this research.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,NE/P006566/2,,,,,,,,University of Edinburgh,,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:15390082,,

In this situation, the use of different substrates in designing artificial reefs is being considered to determine which substrate will develop a marine assemblage. In this study, the settlement of algae and marine invertebrates were compared between wood and plastic substrates over a period of four months (June-September 2007). Settlement plates were deployed at the edge of a fringing reef in Mactan Island, Central Philippines. Results showed that algal biomass was greatest in July and declined through August and September and total invertebrate density differed between substrates and among months. However, only barnacles and sponges were significantly more abundant in plastic than woody substrate while other taxa (i.e., polychaetes, barnacles, hydrozoans) exhibited no difference in abundance between substrates. The dominant invertebrate taxa in the assemblage were the polychaetes which constituted almost 60% and 90% of the total abundance in wood and plastic substrates, respectively. Sponges were the least dominant taxa and comprised only 8% of the total invertebrate density. There was a significant monthly fluctuation in the density of four (i.e., barnacles, molluscs, hydrozoans, polychaetes) out of five taxa. The results that some taxa (i.e., barnacle and sponge) significantly preferred plastic over wood can be put to good use.

The efficacy of near-shore static wind turbines (OWTs) has been extensively demonstrated; approximately 10% of power generated in Q1 of 2019 came from offshore wind, and the UK Government seeks to increase this to 30% by 2030.Evolutionary computation has been widely applied to the design of OWT arrays. Recently, attention has moved to the design of floating offshore wind turbines (FOWTs) which can be placed in deeper water to take advantage of stronger wind conditions. This project will explore multi-objective techniques for optimising the design of FOWT arrays such that maximal benefit is achieved for the minimum possible cost and at the minimum possible environmental impact.The optimisation of static OWTs has been extensively studied. FOWT array optimisation poses a substantially more complex problem as it requires the use of a more complex model capable of incorporating the motion of the turbines.

This newly developing fouling community includes the previously reported invasive orange tube coral Tubastraea coccinea and the non-native giant foam oyster Hyotissa hyotis. New SCUBA-based surveys involving five shipwrecks spanning the upper, middle, and lower Florida Keys, show T. coccinea now also established in the lower Keys and H. hyotis likewise extending to new sites. Two additional mollusks found on the artificial reefs, the amathinid gastropod Cyclothyca pacei and gryphaeid oyster Hyotissa mcgintyi, the latter also common in the natural reef areas, are discussed as potentially non-native. A new species of sessile, suspension-feeding, worm-snail, Thylacodes vandyensis Bieler, Rawlings & Collins n. sp. (Vermetidae), is described from the wreck of the USNS Vandenberg off Key West and discussed as potentially invasive. This new species is compared morphologically and by DNA barcode markers to other known members of the genus, and may be a recent arrival from the Pacific Ocean. Thylacodes vandyensis is polychromatic, with individuals varying in both overall head-foot coloration and mantle margin color pattern. Females brood stalked egg capsules attached to their shell within the confines of their mantle cavity, and give rise to crawl-away juveniles. Such direct-developing species have the demonstrated capacity for colonizing habitats isolated far from their native ranges and establishing rapidly growing founder populations. Vermetid gastropods are common components of the marine fouling community in warm temperate and tropical waters and, as such, have been tagged as potentially invasive or with a high potential to be invasive in the Pacific Ocean. As vermetids can influence coral growth/composition in the Pacific and have been reported serving as intermediate hosts for blood flukes of loggerhead turtles, such new arrivals in the Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary are of concern. Growing evidence indicates that artificial reefs can act as permanent way-stations for arriving non-natives, providing nurseries within which populations may grow in an environment with reduced competition compared to native habitats. Consequently, artificial reefs can act as sentinels for the appearance of new species.

Attempts to maintain and restore marine biodiversity are becoming more spatial, principally through the designation of marine protected areas (MPAs). MPAs compete for space with other uses, and the emergence of new industries, such as marine renewable energy generation, will increase competition for space. Decision makers require guidance on how to zone the ocean to conserve biodiversity, mitigate conflict and accommodate multiple uses. Here we used empirical data and freely available planning software to identified priority areas for multiple ocean zones, which incorporate goals for biodiversity conservation, two types of renewable energy, and three types of fishing. We developed an approached to evaluate trade-offs between industries and we investigated the impacts of co-locating some fishing activities within renewable energy sites. We observed non-linear trade-offs between industries. We also found that different subsectors within those industries experienced very different trade-off curves. Incorporating co-location resulted in significant reductions in cost to the fishing industry, including fisheries that were not co-located. Co-location also altered the optimal location of renewable energy zones with planning solutions. Our findings have broad implications for ocean zoning and marine spatial planning. In particular, they highlight the need to include industry subsectors when assessing trade-offs and they stress the importance of considering co-location opportunities from the outset. Our research reinforces the need for multi-industry ocean-zoning and demonstrates how it can be undertaken within the framework of strategic conservation planning. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

J,,,,,,,,,Rob Harris,,Feasibility of an Innovative Methodology for Testing Marine Current Turbines in Unsteady Flow,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Awarded Grant,Mar 31 2008,2008,"In the early years of the offshore oil industry, many design challenges were met by the incorporation of large factors of safety to allow for a lack of fundamental understanding of appropriate values of design loads. The high profitability of the oil business allowed the resulting high-cost solutions in the short-term; whilst occasional failures could not threaten such a well financed industry. In contrast, the economics of marine renewable energy do not allow such a high-cost approach, whilst early failures in high-profile projects could cause immense damage to the confidence placed in such a fledgling industry. In order to succeed technically and economically, MCT designs must meet stringent environmental legislation, must be efficient, cost effective, environmentally friendly and above all reliable. For this reason it is important to have a fundamental understanding not only of the performance of the rotor itself, but also of the global hydrodynamic loading on the system, in order to allow safe and cost-effective design of the mooring/anchoring system. There has been extensive research over many years aimed at finding approaches for determining drag, added mass and damping effects of fixed and floating offshore structures in unsteady flows - that is flows which vary with time, such as waves, or fluctuating currents - however the applicability of these approaches to the rotating blades of an MCT rotor is highly questionable raising uncertainties in perceived knowledge. The importance of the unsteady loading on the rotors is all the more apparent when their dimensions are considered; current proposals involve pairs of rotors of over 10m diameter, with a swept area which may be 50 times the projected area of the support structure. The global loading is therefore clearly dominated by the moving rotor. The importance of the unsteady hydrodynamic loads, often characterized by added mass and damping coefficients, is further emphasized by the relatively small real mass of these devices in comparison to conventional marine and/or offshore structures. For both fixed and compliant structures, maximum loading as well as fatigue performance are important issues; for compliant structures the influence of the unsteady rotor forces on the global dynamic response is also likely to be a critical parameter in the mooring design. MCTs are likely to operate in environments in which large currents and steep waves will be evident, and appreciable unsteady flows are inevitable. In such cases it is essential that the global added mass and damping of the rotors can be reliably evaluated for a wide range of unsteady flows.Whilst some progress towards the understanding of the unsteady response can be made with sea trials using large scale models, the lack of controllability and repeatability of the real-world environment presents substantial challenges to the development of fundamental understanding of these effects, particularly with regard to extreme conditions. A laboratory-based experimental technique is thus required which can be used to develop this fundamental understanding both directly, through experiment measurement, and indirectly, via the verification and validation of numerical simulation approaches. The study proposed here therefore aims to establish the feasibility of a model-testing methodology to predict these unsteady global loads as well as operational efficiency parameters on horizontal axis marine current turbines, addressing an interesting and challenging hydrodynamic problem of significant practical relevance.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,EP/F062397/1,,,,,,,,Heriot-Watt University,,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:15383575,,

Many proposed wind farms overlap with the distribution of seals, and sound from pile driving has the potential to cause auditory damage. We report on a behavioural study during the construction of a wind farm using data from GPS/GSM tags on 24 harbour seals Phoca vitulina L. Pile driving data and acoustic propagation models, together with seal movement and dive data, allowed the prediction of auditory damage in each seal. Growth and recovery functions for auditory damage were combined to predict temporary auditory threshold shifts in each seal. Further, M-weighted cumulative sound exposure levels [cSELs(M-pw)] were calculated and compared to permanent auditory threshold shift exposure criteria for pinnipeds in water exposed to pulsed sounds. The closest distance of each seal to pile driving varied from 47 to 405km, and predicted maximum cSELs(M-pw) ranged from 1707 to 1953 dB re 1Pa(2)-s for individual seals. Comparison to exposure criteria suggests that half of the seals exceeded estimated permanent auditory damage thresholds. Prediction of auditory damage in marine mammals is a rapidly evolving field and has a number of key uncertainties associated with it. These include how sound propagates in shallow water environments and the effects of pulsed sounds on seal hearing; as such, our predictions should be viewed in this context.Policy implications. We predicted that half of the tagged seals received sound levels from pile driving that exceeded auditory damage thresholds for pinnipeds. These results have implications for offshore industry and will be important for policymakers developing guidance for pile driving. Developing engineering solutions to reduce sound levels at source or methods to deter animals from damage risk zones, or changing temporal patterns of piling could potentially reduce auditory damage risk. Future work should focus on validating these predictions by collecting auditory threshold information pre- and post-exposure to pile driving. Ultimately, information on population-level impacts of exposure to pile driving is required to ensure that offshore industry is developed in an environmentally sustainable manner.We predicted that half of the tagged seals received sound levels from pile driving that exceeded auditory damage thresholds for pinnipeds.

Nine structures were anchored at depths of 16 +/- 1.5 m for 99 weeks (22 months) in the Area of Benthic Resource Management and Exploitation (AMERB) in coastal waters of the Region of Bio Bio, Chile. The results showed that, at 3 months from submersion of the NTAR, much of the artificial substrate remained bare and there were only low levels of specimens ofBalanussp. barnacles, showing mean coverage of 11.26%, and even lower proportions of Rhodophyta, with mean coverage of 0.34%. At 6 months, the presence of hydrozoans was seen, decreasing the coverage of the barnacles, which was aided further at 8 months with the arrival of barnacle predatory invertebrates. At 8 months, new benthic invertebrates appeared and competed for the substrate. These included sponges and algae. At 99 weeks, the hydrozoans dominated the substrate, followed by barnacles and Rhodophyta, the first colonising organisms, leading to colonisation by motile macro-invertebrates, mainly consisting of crustaceans, echinoderms and molluscs. The AATN artificial system provides an ideal substrate for the development of early ecological succession and the use of this technology should be feasible in the recovery process of habitat damaged by anthropogenic actions and climate change.",,,,,,,,,10,1,0,0,8,0,12,,,,2192-1709,,,,,,,,,,"Pontificia Univ Catolica Valparaiso, Fac Ciencias Mar & Geog, Escuela Ciencias Mar, Valparaiso, Chile",,,,2020-08-07,WOS:000552401900001,,

The study focuses on 3 ARs located along the Gulf of Lion coastline in the French Mediterranean Sea. At the end of spring 2012, experimental fishing with trammel nets was conducted at ARs and natural rocky areas (NRs) at various distances from the ARs/ NRs (0, 300 and 900 m). The yields of fish and invertebrates were analyzed at the AR sites to identify significant changes along a distance gradient and to determine whether there was a significant difference between ARs and NRs. The AR yields of species preferring rocky substrates were generally higher between 0 and 300 m from the ARs than beyond 300 m, whereas the yields of species preferring sandy substrates or of invertebrates did not differ between 0 and 900 m from the ARs. Furthermore, the AR yields were equal to the NR yields or were between 1.5- and 1.8-fold higher than the NR yields. Overall, this study indicates that success varied by species, fishing locality and distance from the reef. ARs could be a potentially effective tool for enhancing artisanal fishing along the French Mediterranean coasts. However, it would be necessary to establish management measures to avoid over exploitation. For instance, in terms of the configuration of the AR areas in a given locality, a notake area could be established within a radius of 300 m around the ARs.",,,,,,,,,10,1,0,0,8,0,12,,,1864-7790,1864-7782,,,,,,,,,,"SEANEO, F-66100 Perpignan, FranceUniv Perpignan Via Domitia, Ctr Format & Rech Environm Mediterraneens, UMR 5110, F-66860 Perpignan, FranceCNRS, Ctr Format & Rech Environm Mediterraneens, UMR 5110, F-66860 Perpignan, FranceMairie Agde, Direct Gest Milieu Marin, F-34300 Agde, France",SEANEOMairie Agde,,,2014-06-11,WOS:000335827900008,,

The U.S. electricity generation system, about 70 % fossil fuels and 20 % nuclear, is undergoing a sea change (EIA 2010). Two difficulties stand out in siting any utility-scale power plant and its delivery infrastructure anywhere; the potential catastrophic risks associated with oil and gas drilling and nuclear technologies, and the need to quickly expand low carbon, cost-effective energy supplies to meet expected demand under climate change scenarios in the next decade. Offshore wind has the potential to play a pivotal role in the low carbon energy supplies needed on the east coast and Great Lakes of the U.S. (DOE 2008, Musial and Ram 2010). The Department of Energy (DOE) estimated that the U.S. electricity sector could avoid 825 million tons of CO2 by integrating 20% wind energy (including 54 GW of offshore wind) into the U.S. electricity system by 2030 (DOE 2008a). The benefits of wind energy in mitigating climate change and other energy issues need to be considered together with the negative impacts in estimating and comparing risks involved in different energy sources (NRC 2009a). The European Community has shown the pathway with gigawatt-scale deployments operating, under construction, and planned in the Baltic, North and Irish Seas (Global Offshore Wind Farms Database 2011). This article argues that a new paradigm with a more systematic approach, beyond the engineering, policy, and financial market barriers, is essential to better inform gigawatt-scale wind decision makers and stakeholders. The diverse community of players and decision makers in the offshore wind industry requires a robust, integrated knowledge base. The knowledge base can help avoid surprises that impede and delay siting projects while laying the base for effective and fair approaches for communities along our coasts and Lakes. A new paradigm is proposed, an integrated risk analysis, as an effective approach to complex siting and community engagement issues.",,,,,,,,,11,0,0,0,2,0,11,,,0309-524X,2048-402X,,,,,,,,,,"Ram Power LLC, 1925 16th ST,NW,Suite 302, Washington, DC 20009 USA",Ram Power LLC,,,2011-06-01,WOS:000210784000002,,

To ensure the sustainability of coastal fisheries in northern Chile this study aims to investigate fishermen's perceptions on deploying artificial reefs and propose future management measures using Caleta Pisagua as a case study. Interviews of artisanal fishermen regarding four aspects: fishermen profile, fishing activity, resources, and artificial reefs were conducted. Results showed that most fishermen favored the implementation of artificial reefs within the Areas of Management and Exploitation of Benthic Resources (AMERBs). In addition, deploying artificial reefs appears to be socio-economically necessary for the artisanal fishermen whose livelihood is being affected by the overexploitation of coastal fish and because hard substrates essential for benthic resources are in short supply within this administration area.

Only Lanzarote and Fuerteventura are electrically connected by submarine wire.It has been studied the possibility of constructing pumping hydro plants with the aim of storing energy, reducing consumption and increasing penetration of renewables in the islands. Concretely, the studies were performed in five islands whose height would allow the construction of this type of plants. Lanzarote and Fuerteventura have been left out by environmental reasons and to be very flat. Today the Store project is been executed by ENDESA electricity company, where three electrical storage systems are analyzed although they are very small and very expensive [5].So our aim is to obtain a high production of electricity from renewable sources in a small space with a lot of protected areas. For this reason we have thought about the possibility of building an offshore wind farm.When you are looking for a suitable place for the construction of an offshore wind farm in an archipelago, you think of a place near the center of the demand and near the island with more people and more activity, which in this case is Gran Canaria.

Climate change may speed this change. This will mean profound impacts on low-lying coastal areas over the next 50 years, particularly along the eastern coast of England.These physical changes in the coastal zone will occur alongside, and interact with. a variety of human impacts and drivers of change. Agricultural policy reform, and changes in production in response to this and to climate change, will alter coastal landscapes as well as sediment and nutrient inputs into coastal waters. Demographic change - an increasing UK population, who are on average older and who potentially have more leisure time - will be likely to bring about an increased demand for the recreational opportunities that the coast provides. This will mean more demand for land for housing and recreational facilities. A continuing trend of rising income levels may also fuel further demand for imported goods and hence the need for further port development, particularly in the south east of England.

The piles and hard substrate surrounding these piles creates new habitat for species with preference to hard substrates. We studied the impact of this hard substrate on the fish community in a Dutch OWF in the sandy southern North Sea, which had been in operation for five years. Multi-mesh gillnets were placed near the OWF structures on the hard substrate protection revetments and on the sandy bottom in the middle of the farm. The catches indicated attraction of cod, pouting, bullrout and edible and velvet crab, while attraction to the sandy habitat was shown for flatfish and whiting. Further, two species previously not caught in this area, goldsinny wrasse and grey trigger fish, were caught on the hard substrate. In addition a Dual-Frequency Identification Sonar (DIDSON) was used to record transects through the farm to observe individual fish in the water column throughout the farm and very near the OWF structures. High abundances of fish near the structure were observed during some days, while during other days equal distribution of fish in the area was observed. The area around the structures is thus only used temporarily for shelter or feeding. The DIDSON also allowed looking at the aggregation level of the fish. Seasonally the aggregation level differed most likely due to different species occurring in the area. In April, most fish were aggregated in schools, while in summer most observations were individual fish or loose aggregations. The wind farm structures had limited effect on the aggregation level compared to season or weather conditions. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Reefs were divided into three regions (east, central, west) across an east to west gradient of increasing reef complexity and salinity. Gray triggerfish (Balistes capriscus) primarily consumed reef-associated prey (xanthid crabs, bivalves, barnacles) and pelagic gastropods, while red snapper (Lutjanus campechanus) diets were mainly comprised of non-reef prey (stomato-pods, fishes, portunid crabs). Natural stable isotopes of carbon (delta C-13), nitrogen (delta N-15), and sulfur (delta S-34) were measured in consumer muscle tissue as well as potential primary producers. Gray triggerfish occupied a lower trophic position than red snapper, with lower delta C-13 and delta N-15 values across all size classes and regions, and generally higher delta S-34 values. Red snapper had a smaller range of stable isotope values and corrected standard ellipse areas across all size classes and regions, indicating a smaller isotopic niche. Contribution estimates of particulate organic matter (26 to 54%) and benthic microalgae (BMA, 47 to 74%) for both species were similar, with BMA contributions greater across all three size classes (juveniles, sub-adults, adults) of red snapper and all but the juvenile size class for gray triggerfish.

Multi-seasonal sampling was conducted at a typical large steel jacketed facility, using mid-water fish traps at three different depths (i.e., 10, 50 & 100 m). Commercially important gadoids such as saithe Pollachius virens, haddock Melanogrammus aeglefinus and cod Gadus morhua were the most abundant species, however, the species composition and the relative abundances of the species varied with depth, season and between years. Comparisons with a large-scale bottom trawl survey data suggested highly dynamic and species-specific interactions between fish movements, changing environmental conditions and the physical presence of an offshore platform. Given the number of platforms currently installed across the North Sea, there is a need to identify biological mechanisms behind such dynamic interactions. (C) 2015 The Author.

However, quantifying the success of restoration projects can be difficult, and adequate monitoring data are scarce. This study compared growth rates over a six-year period of three Caribbean coral species, staghorn coral (Acropora cervicornis), elkhorn coral (Acropora palmata), and thick finger coral (Porites porites), transplanted on an artificial reef off Maiden Island, Antigua, to literature values for the same species growing on naturally formed reefs in the Caribbean region. The average growth rate of staghorn coral was considerably lower than growth rates reported in the literature, while elkhorn and finger corals showed growth rates similar to literature values. The observed inter- and intraspecific differences may be caused by species-specific growth requirements and/or restoration site conditions, factors that should be taken into account when planning future projects involving coral transplant or rescue. This study also determined the analytical precision of a 'low tech' monitoring method using a basic underwater digital camera and the software program ImageJ to measure growth rates of corals. Measurement error between volunteer analysts receiving only minimal training was shown to be very small, ranging from 0.37-1.40% depending on the coral species.

To arrive at a suitable reference dataset, the performance of wind outputs from three different reanalysis datasets is evaluated. The comparison across the RCMs and their corresponding parent GCMs is done on the basis of annual/seasonal wind statistics, intermodel bias, wind climatology, and classes of wind potential. It was observed that while the RCMs could simulate spatial variability of winds, well for certain subregions, they generally failed to replicate the overall spatial pattern, especially in monsoon and winter. Various causes of biases in RCMs were determined by assessing corresponding maps of wind vectors, surface temperature, and sea-level pressure. The results highlight the necessity to carefully assess the RCM-yielded winds before using them for sensitive applications such as coastal vulnerability and hazard assessment. A supplementary outcome of this study is in form of wind potential atlas, based on spatial distribution of wind classes. This could be beneficial in suitably identifying viable subregions for developing offshore wind farms by intercomparing both the RCM and GCM outcomes. It is encouraging that most of the RCMs and GCMs indicate that around 70% of the Indian offshore locations in monsoon would experience mean wind potential greater than 200W/m(2).",,,,,,,,,11,0,0,0,1,0,11,,,0177-798X,1434-4483,,,,,,,,,,"Indian Inst Technol, Dept Civil Engn, Mumbai, Maharashtra, India",,,,2019-05-08,WOS:000464905800044,,

By looking into a limited number of attempts at substitution and restoration of ecosystem services (e.g. artificial reefs, aquaculture in mangroves, artificial seawalls), we address the questions: (1) To what degree can technologies substitute for ecosystem services in the seascape? (2) How can ecosystem restoration reestablish not only the functions of direct value to humans, but also the ability of the systems to cope with future disturbance? Substitutions often imply the replacement of a function provided free by a solar powered, self-repairing resilient ecosystem, with a fossil-fuel-powered, expensive, artificial substitute that needs maintenance. Further, restoration usually does not focus on large-scale processes such as the physical, biological and biogeochemical interactions between mangroves, seagrass beds and coral reefs. Nonetheless, restoration might be the only viable management alternative when the system is essentially locked into an undesired community state (stability domain) after a phase-shift. We conclude that ecosystem services cannot be readily replaced, restored or sustained without extensive knowledge of the dynamics, multifunctionality and interconnectedness of ecosystems.

Nevertheless, the planning of an offshore wind energy project needs to be addressed carefully so as not to interfere with other economic activities or sensitive environmentally protected areas, among other constraints. Similarly, although the offshore wind resource is naturally higher than the resource onshore, the investment costs ()including operation and maintenance) are also considerably higher, hence the need to establish straightforward and transparent methodologies for offshore wind planning. Most of the methodologies used for planning purposes are based on geographic information systems (GIS) due to its powerful capabilities in managing, formatting and modelling large amounts of georeferenced data usually involved in planning procedures. This chapter presents a methodology for offshore wind energy planning taking into consideration the several aspects of sea use and the main restrictions which can be relevant for wind farm installation.

In the case of sea ducks along the U.S. Atlantic coast, managers want to estimate local and regional abundance to detect and track population declines, to define areas of high and low use, and to predict the impact of future habitat change on populations. In this paper, we used a modified marked point process to model survey data that recorded flock sizes of Common eiders, Long-tailed ducks, and Black, Surf, and White-winged scoters. The data come from an experimental aerial survey, conducted by the United States Fish & Wildlife Service (USFWS) Division of Migratory Bird Management, during which east-west transects were flown along the Atlantic Coast from Maine to Florida during the winters of 2009-2011. To model the number of flocks per transect (the points), we compared the fit of four statistical distributions (zero-inflated Poisson, zero-inflated geometric, zero-inflated negative binomial and negative binomial) to data on the number of species-specific sea duck flocks that were recorded for each transect flown. To model the flock sizes (the marks), we compared the fit of flock size data for each species to seven statistical distributions: positive Poisson, positive negative binomial, positive geometric, logarithmic, discretized lognormal, zeta and Yule-Simon. Akaike's Information Criterion and Vuong's closeness tests indicated that the negative binomial and discretized lognormal were the best distributions for all species for the points and marks, respectively. These findings have important implications for estimating sea duck-abundances as the discretized lognormal is a more skewed distribution than the Poisson and negative binomial, which are frequently used to model avian counts; the lognormal is also less heavy-tailed than the power law distributions (e.g., zeta and Yule-Simon), which are becoming increasingly popular for group size modeling. Choosing appropriate statistical distributions for modeling flock size data is fundamental to accurately estimating population summaries, determining required survey effort, and assessing and propagating uncertainty through decision-making processes.

With the advancement of VSC-HVDC technology reactance can be smoothly controlled, hence transfer capability can be enhanced. VSC-HVDC (voltage source converter- high voltage direct current) technology also meets the challenges that are faced by 2-level and multilevel converters. Rapid developments in IGBT open new gate for controlled strategy in converters. Due to this there is a paradigms shift in interfacing renewable energy with electric power system.

No significant differences were found in the either the diets or mean values of delta C-13, delta N-15, or delta S-34 of spotted seatrout between habitats. Differences were seen in both the centroid distance and total area of the delta C-13-delta N-15 biplot for spotted seatrout indicating greater trophic niche breath at the artificial reef. Diets of Atlantic croaker differed significantly between habitats and specimens were more enriched in delta N-15 at the artificial reef; however, no differences in trophic niche breadth were observed. Bay anchovy were more depleted in both delta C-13 and delta S-34 over the artificial reef and differences in the trophic niche breadth were observed.

These limitations can compromise the practical value of wind farm impact studies. We used radar- and observer-based methods to quantify great white pelican flights in the vicinity of a planned wind farm on the Cape west coast, South Africa, and modelled turbine collision risk under various scenarios. Model outputs were combined with pre-existing demographic data to evaluate the possible influence of the wind farm on the pelican population, and to examine impact mitigation options. We recorded high volumes of great white pelican movement through the wind farm area, coincident with the breeding cycle of the nearby colony and associated with flights to feeding areas located about 50 km away. Pelicans were exposed to collision risk at a mean rate of 2.02 High Risk flights.h(-1). Risk was confined to daylight hours, highest during the middle of the day and in conditions of strong north-westerly winds, and 82% of High Risk flights were focused on only five of the proposed 35 turbine placements. Predicted mean mortality rates (22 fatalities.yr(-1)(1, 95% CI, 16-29, with average bird and blade speeds and 95% avoidance rates) were not sustainable, resulting in a negative population growth rate (lambda = 0.991). Models suggested that removal of the five highest risk turbines from the project, or institution of a curtailment regimen that shuts down at least these turbines at peak traffic times, could theoretically reduce impacts to manageable levels. However, in spite of the large quantities of high quality data used in our analyses, our collision risk model remains compromised by untested assumptions about pelican avoidance rates and uncertainties about the existing dynamics of the pelican population, and our findings are probably not reliable enough to ensure sustainable development.",,,,,,,,,5,0,0,0,5,0,6,,,1932-6203,,,,,,,,,,,"AVISENSE Consulting, Cape Town, Western Cape, South AfricaUniv Cape Town, DST NRF Ctr Excellence, Percy FitzPatrick Inst African Ornithol, Cape Town, Western Cape, South AfricaNCC Environm Serv, Cape Town, Western Cape, South AfricaGeocline Consulting, Cape Town, Western Cape, South AfricaEchoTrack Inc, Ottawa, ON, CanadaBirdlife South Africa, Johannesburg, Gauteng, South Africa",AVISENSE ConsultingNCC Environm ServGeocline ConsultingEchoTrack IncBirdlife South Africa,,,2018-02-20,WOS:000424302800077,29408877,

For the first time, images collected from a cabled video-observatory (the western Mediterranean expandable SEAfloor OBservatory; OBSEA) were utilized to examine habitat utilization by coastal fishes. Over the course of a year, hourly digital images of the water column and an artificial reef were obtained during daylight hours. For each image, the total number of species, an estimate of the abundance of individuals, and the Shannon Diversity Index were quantified. A total of 22 fish species commonly associated with nearshore western Mediterranean habitats were identified, and significant spatial (water column vs. artificial reef), seasonal (spring, summer, autumn, and winter), and daily (morning, midday, and sunset) differences in habitat utilization occurred. Four species (Diplodus vulgaris, Diplodus cervinus, Diplodus sargus, and Scorpaena porcus) were associated with the artificial reef, while one species (Pagrus pagrus) chiefly occurred in the water column. Chromis chromis and Diplodus annularis occurred at the site more frequently in the winter and autumn, respectively, while 14 other species utilized the site more frequently in either the spring (8 spp) or summer (6 spp). In addition, Dentex dentex and Spicara maena occurred more frequently at sunset, while D. cervinus displayed a crepuscular rhythm (occurring more frequently in the morning and at sunset). Species diversity was highest in the summer and lowest in the winter. If not taken into account when planning in situ sampling, such seasonal and/or diel differences may lead to spurious estimates of population sizes and biodiversity.

When connected, access is provided to the well and reservoir, and allows for operations such as further drilling, side tracking or workover. Once the operation is completed, the BOP is disconnected from the well, and the wellhead system is not exposed to cyclic loading any longer. Over the lifetime of a well, a number of such operations take place. A wellhead system is perhaps exposed to a total duration of fatigue loading of up to a year, which comprises a sequence of operations of different durations in different seasons. Fatigue predictions for offshore structures are typically based on statistical average of environmental conditions over a large number of years. This is appropriate for permanent installations exposed to continuous wave loading over the lifetime which is often 20 years or more, since variations in the environmental conditions from one year to another is equally represented in the statistics and experienced by the structure. However, for an operation of short duration, the uncertainty in the environmental conditions for that particular period in that particular year needs to be addressed. The weather during October this year is unlikely to be the same as in October last year, and can also be significantly different from average October weather. Although there exists no standard way of doing wellhead fatigue analysis, a commonly applied approach is to do the analysis in a single plane. This is obviously conservative since the wave direction will vary over time, and the fatigue loading will be distributed more around the circumference of the pipe sections in the wellhead system. Furthermore, the environmental conditions are typically based on statistical average for the month or season when the operation is to be executed, sometimes with some conservatism of including the adjacent more severe month or using annual data. Long crested waves are often assumed. This paper address the effect of the uncertainty in the environmental conditions on the accumulated fatigue damage for single and sequences of operations of different durations at different times of the year. A drilling rig in the North Sea has been analyzed using 56 years of hind cast data of significant wave height, peak wave period and main wave direction. Statistics of the fatigue damage rates are calculated and used in a structural reliability analysis in order to estimate reasonably but not overly conservative factors that are to be multiplied with the fatigue damage estimated in a conventional design analyses. Results based on long crested and short crested sea are calculated. An annual variation factor is proposed to account for the variability from one year to another. Secondly, a directional effect factor is proposed to account for the directional variations and its uncertainty on fatigue. Both factors are first estimated considering a single operation only, where the duration is varied between 3 days and up to a year. Thereafter, a sequence of operations of different durations at different times of the year is analyzed, and it is proposed how to consider the accumulated duration of such sequences compared to a single continuous operation. The expected result is an annual variation factor which is greater or equal to unity and a directional effect factor which is less than unity, both with lower values the longer the duration.The product of the two is a quantification of the degree of conservatism associated with a deterministic design analysis using long crested head sea and statistical average omnidirectional weather for the planned drilling operations.",,,,,"34th ASME International Conference on Ocean, Offshore and Arctic Engineering (OMAE2015)34th ASME International Conference on Ocean, Offshore and Arctic Engineering (OMAE2015)","MAY 31-JUN 05, 2015MAY 31-JUN 05, 2015","Amer Soc Mech Engn, Ocean Offshore & Arct Engn DivAmer Soc Mech Engn, Ocean Offshore & Arct Engn Div","St John's, CANADASt John's, CANADA",3,0,0,0,0,0,3,,,,,978-0-7918-5647-5,,,,,,,,,"DNV GL, Oslo, NorwayStatoil ASA, Oslo, NorwayStatoil ASA, Houston, TX USAStatoil ASA, Stavanger, Norway",,,,2016-09-02,WOS:000379706800052,,

We deployed an array of 28 artificial reefs with transplanted Ecklonia radiata, the dominant canopy-forming kelp species across southern Australia, to investigate how the patch size and density of E. radiata influenced the establishment of the associated communities of plants and animals. Many of the reefs were rapidly colonized by Ostrea angasi, a critically depleted reef-forming oyster. Over the 24-month deployment of the reefs, thick oyster mats formed across the entire surface of many of the reefs with estimated biomass densities exceeding 5 kg of live oysters/m(2); however, oyster density was dependent on E. radiata patch size and density. Increasing patch size and the presence of kelp resulted in significantly higher densities of oysters 5 months after the reefs were deployed and at the end of the experiment, where oysters were approximately three times more numerous on reefs with kelp compared to those without kelp. E. radiata appeared to facilitate the establishment of O. angasi largely through its capacity to reduce benthic light and thus suppress competition from turfing algae.

(2) B area: CPUE in AR area was obviously improved by 2.05 times after deployment (P>0.05) and 2 times higher than control site (P>0.05).Species richness level has been improved by 25.3% after reef deployment, though no significant difference were found between them. However, it did have a better level than control site by 31.3% higher (P<0.05).5 more commercial species were sampled in AR area after reef deployment compared to its originally number (P<0.05), and about 4 more species were sampled in AR area than control site after reefs were set. The diversity index in AR area have improved to a certain level better than before and control site, though they appeared to be not so quite different (0.05 <0.1). It is concluded that resource level and community structure have been improved a lot in both AR areas by comparisons to its originally level and control site level.

All habitats were sampled using baited re mote underwater video (BRUV) and underwater visual census (UVC) multiple times, 6 mo before and 22 mo after artificial reef deployment. Fish species rapidly colonised artificial reefs, with 30 new species detected in the first year post deployment and only 4 in the following year. Both sampling methods captured a shift in assemblage structure, albeit with different species compositions, as individual species numbers varied dependent upon method used. BRUV provided better estimates of the important recreational species snapper Chrysophrys auratus (family Sparidae), with more snapper recorded on artificial and natural reefs compared to sediment. The artificial reef assemblages were dominated by species that favour the reef/sediment interface. Several reef-associated species were detected in the juvenile stages; however, adults of obligate reef species were not observed on artificial reefs.

In aquatic environments, a popular approach toward habitat enhancement is the introduction of underwater human-made structures or artificial reefs. Despite the nearly global prevalence of artificial reefs deployed to enhance habitat, it remains debated whether these structures function similarly to comparable natural reefs. To help resolve this question, we conducted a literature review and accompanying meta-analysis of fish community metrics on artificial reefs within the coastal ocean and made comparisons with naturally-occurring reference reefs (rocky reefs and coral reefs). Our findings from a synthesis of 39 relevant studies revealed that, across reef ecosystems, artificial reefs support comparable levels of fish density, biomass, species richness, and diversity to natural reefs. Additional analyses demonstrated that nuances in these patterns were associated with the geographic setting (ocean basin, latitude zone) and artificial reef material. These findings suggest that, while artificial reefs can mimic natural reefs in terms of the fish assemblages they support, artificial reefs are not one-size-fits-all tools for habitat enhancement. Instead, artificial reefs should be considered strategically based on location-specific scientific assessments and resource needs to maximize benefits of habitat enhancement.

The reefs were located in areas characterized by different degrees of water transparency, with average annual Secchi disk visibility ranging from clear (>20m) to turbid waters (<6 m). In spring 1995. 28 samples of 400 cm(2) were scraped off the reefs at depths of 16-22 to (20 from ARs; 8 front NRs), which yielded a total of 116 species and 1084 specimens of molluscs. The assemblage derived from a NR in clear water showed the highest diversity, species richness, and evenness, while the highest number of specimens and dominance values were observed at an AR in turbid water. The lowest values of diversity and species richness were found at ARs in turbid water and the lowest number of specimens at a NR in turbid water. Comparison of the five reefs showed significant differences in average number of species and in diversity values, while differences in the number of specimens were not significant. Factorial correspondence analysis showed a pattern that was strongly polarized along the first axis by the NR in clear water and by the AR ill turbid water. The most distinctive feature was the dominance of Bittium latreillii at AR sites. Three years after deployment, mollusc assemblages of ARs in the Gulf remain entities that are distinct from those of nearby natural reefs. However, the potential of the assemblages in terms of density of individuals is comparable to that of natural reefs. (C) 2002 International Council for the Exploration of the Sea.

However there is insufficient information to verify that artificial reefs enhance biological resources. To study their value for mitigating habitat loss, 16 prefabricated concrete terraced artificial reef modules were deployed in lower Delaware Bay in 1989. A 5-year monitoring study was begun to assess the artificial reef's value as a long-term habitat and forage area for fishery resources as compared to non-reef habitats in the Bay. After 2 years, the reef modules appear to be physically stable and support biological resources. Fishes, including juveniles, typical of reefs in the region, were observed in and near the reef The blue mussel, Mytilus edulis, dominated the epibenthic community that developed on the modules and was primarily responsible for a mean epibenthic biomass density of 24.865 kg.nm-2 (wet wt.) on module surfaces through June 1991. However, this mussel-dominated density was reduced, by approximately 95%, in August 1991 to a mean 0.596 kg.m(-2), with other taxa such as, sponges, corals, and anemones increasing in community importance. In comparison to the epibenthic biomass on the modules, the mean benthic infauna biomass in the silty sand sediments of the reef site ranged from 0.046 to 0.316 kg.m(-2) in 1991. These preliminary results suggest that this artificial reef complex enhanced gross benthic biomass at the reef site by about 147 to 895 fold over the benthic infauna in the study area, based on a standard area of Bay bottom, the reef module ''footprint.''",,,,,,,,,16,0,0,0,9,1,20,,,0007-4977,,,,,,,,,,,"NOAA,NATL MARINE FISHERIES SERV,HIGHLANDS,NJ 07732US EPA,PHILADELPHIA,PA 19106US CORPS ENGINEERS,PHILADELPHIA,PA 19106",US CORPS ENGINEERS,,,1994-09-01,WOS:A1994QB58400042,,

To assure safety at each location, site-specific assessment is required to predict the performance of the unit during installation and operations. The response of jack-ups to environmental loads is highly affected by the interaction between all footings (spudcans) and the underlying soil, an interaction still challenging to describe under general 3D loading.This work emphasises the potential of 3D continuum simulations to capture non-linear soilstructural interaction in jack-up units. An integrated jack-up-spudcans-soil 3D finite element (FE) model is set up by including strain-hardening soil plasticity and geometrical non-linearity (P - Delta effects). After preliminary calibration of soil parameters, the FE model is successfully validated against literature results, namely obtained through (i) small-scale centrifuge experiments and (ii) numerical simulations based on macroelement foundation modelling. The validated FE model is then used to inspect several implications of soil modelling assumptions, as well as the response of the jack-up to relevant 3D loading combinations.The results presented support 3D continuum modelling as a suitable approach to analyse spudcan fixity and, overall, the operational performance of jack-ups.

It was found that Ostrea plicatula Gmelin was the dominant species of fouling organisms, and that additives did not apparently affect the fouling organisms. Peanut straw and A. irradias shell did not improve the carbon sequestration of O. plicatula Gmelin (P>0.05). The calculation of carbon sequestration in the reefs with addition of shell showed that the minimum carbon content per unit reef was 104.13 kg and 2.60 kg per hollow stere, and that the maximum content per unit reef was 260.32 kg and 6.51 kg per hollow stere.

This last issue was fundamental to examining possible interactions between AR presence and riverine discharges. The results of this study showed that the most efficient meiofaunal descriptors were diversity indices and the Ne:Co ratio, and suggested that the existence of ARs along with uncontrolled riverine discharges may increase anthropogenic impacts upon coastlines.

Both manual and passive telemetry were used to examine fine-scale movement patterns and residence time of red snapper around artificial habitats to evaluate the importance of these structures to this species. Red snapper (550-745 mm TL; n = 12) were manually tracked at artificial reefs in the northeastern GOM over 24-h periods. Fish stayed near the artificial reefs (<100 m, with 75% of locations within 30 m of the structure), but were significantly further from the reefs at night (mean = 27.5 m, SD = 7.1) than day (mean = 19.1 m, SD = 8.2). Based on manual tracking, home range and mean distance from the reef increased with fish size. These fish also showed long term residence of 332-958d based on passive acoustic monitoring. The close proximity of these fish to the reef over 24-h periods and the long-term residency provides evidence that these artificial reefs are important habitat for red snapper and should be considered an effective management tool.

PBRUVs were deployed at three distances (30, 100, 500m) from the OAR, and compared with a drop camera deployed directly over the OAR. There was a significantly greater abundance of fish on the OAR, but no significant difference in abundance at the 30-, 100- or 500-m distances. Two highly mobile non-resident species (Seriola lalandi, Pseudocaranx dentex) were significantly more abundant on the OAR, but this association was not detected 30m away. The lack of a significant difference in total fish abundance, or in assemblage composition, between the 30-, 100- and 500-m distances suggests that any association with the OAR is on a localised scale (<30m).

Despite their widespread use, there is much uncertainty about both the actual benefits of artificial reefs and the ecological mechanisms through which such benefits might be produced. This paper reports on a five and one-half year study of the development of turf communities on a new artificial reef in southern California, Pendleton Artificial Reef(PAR). These communities were sampled extensively and compared to analogous communities at an older artificial reef and a natural reef in the region. Sampling was designed to document potential differences due to time since construction, height above the ocean bottom, season, location within reef (e.g., current and edge effects), and sporadic disturbances. Questions about the speed and pattern of development of turf communities are important because of their role in providing habitat and food for both resident and transient fish populations. Multivariate analyses, which are more sensitive than species-by-species approaches, were used to describe and compare temporal and spatial patterns. These analyses showed a typical successional pattern at PAR in which the turf community became progressively more similar to that at older reefs over time. At PAR, species groups dominated by a mud ectoproct, barnacles, algal turf, hydroids, erect ectoprocts and Rhodymenia spp. were steadily replaced by species groups characterized by the scaled worm mollusk, the ornate jewel box, and gorgonians over the period of the study. The nature and speed of this process suggests that it may take 10-15 yrs for turf communities on new artificial reefs to mimic those on natural reefs.",,,,,,,,,20,2,0,0,15,1,27,,,0007-4977,1553-6955,,,,,,,,,,"State Calif Dept Fish & Game, Marine Resources Div, Healdsburg, CA 95448 USAEcoAnal Inc, Ojai, CA 93023 USA",State Calif Dept Fish & GameEcoAnal Inc,,,1999-07-01,WOS:000081420400003,,

We compared the coral communities on standing offshore oil/gas production platforms with those on Rigs-to-Reef structures through Remotely Operated Vehicle reconnaissance (max. depth similar to 110 m) to assess comparative population sizes of several coral species. Corals found were the zooxanthellate Madracis decactis and azooxanthellate Tubastraea coccinea, Oculina diffusa, and Phyllangia americana. There was no significant difference in total coral density between standing and toppled platforms, due to varying species-specific abundances. Madracis decactis and T. coccinea densities were significantly higher on toppled structures than on standing ones, P. americana was more abundant on standing platforms, and O. diffusa densities were not significantly different between the two sets of platforms. Corals were distributed more deeply on standing platforms than on toppled ones (particularly O. diffusa and P. americana). Madracis decactis (requiring light) and T. coccinea were concentrated at shallower depths (<= 50 m). Rigs-to-Reefs structures serve as substrate for coral settlement.

These challenges can be grouped into four categories: issues related with industry immatureness; distance/water depth; weather window; and policy issues. The Delphi study identified three other major issues that lead to increased O&M costs: too many predefined rules that limit development; lack of coordinated planning of the different services offered at the wind farms; and lack of a common approach on how O&M should be managed strategically.Research limitations/implications - The present study is based only on Danish respondents. Future research needs to include various respondents from different countries to identify country-specific contingencies.Practical implications - The paper provides an overview of the O&M issues in the offshore wind energy sector to prioritize where future resources should be invested and, thus, reduce O&M costs.Originality/value - This is the first paper on O&M issues that bridges both literature studies and industry expert opinions.",,,,,,,,,10,1,0,0,0,0,10,,,1750-6220,1750-6239,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Southern Denmark, Dept Entrepreneurship & Relationship Management, Kolding, DenmarkUniv Southern Denmark, Dept Entrepreneurship & Relationship Management, Supply Chain Management, Kolding, Denmark",,,,2017-03-08,WOS:000394392400006,,

The creation of artificial reefs is considered a key program for developing sustainable marine tourism and enhancing fish and invertebrate populations. Although there are many successful artificial reef programs that have been reported in the literature, some artificial reef programs are not effective due to a lack of decision-making protocols for selecting the best or optimal location for artificial reef deployment. This paper develops a model for selecting the best location for artificial reef deployment by using multiple criteria. Two different decision-making techniques (i.e., analytical hierarchy process and evidential reasoning) are employed in this model. To demonstrate the applicability of the proposed model, three potential sites off Perhentian Island (i.e., Pasir Tani, Tokong Laut, and Pulau Susu Dara Kecil), Malaysia were examined. Based on these test cases, the three most important criteria in selecting the best artificial reef site are sediment type, water depth, and presence of a local, natural reef. Based on the proposed model, Pulau Susu Dara Kecil was assessed as the best site for an artificial reef deployment compared to Pasir Tani and Tokong Laut. This proposed model is capable of assisting researchers and government agencies such as the Department of Fisheries Malaysia (DoFM) and the Department of Marine Park Malaysia (DMPM) in selecting the best sites for artificial reef deployment and can be modified based on decision makers' preferences and priorities.",,,,,Symposium on Marine Artificial Reef Research and Development: Integrating Fisheries Management ObjectivesSymposium on Marine Artificial Reef Research and Development: Integrating Fisheries Management Objectives,"AUG 22-23, 2017AUG 22-23, 2017",,"Tampa, FLTampa, FL",3,0,0,0,1,0,3,,,0892-2284,,978-1-934874-51-6,,,,,,,,,"Univ Malaysia Terengganu, Sch Maritime Business & Management, Kuala Nerus 21030, Terengganu, Malaysia",,,,2019-02-13,WOS:000456750700015,,

In particular, the effect of depth on fish abundance and species composition is understudied in coastal environments (and the transition zone of macroalgae to non-macroalgae reefs) due to limitations of traditional visual survey methods. This study used a 'drop camera' survey method for 37 reef sites off the coast of Sydney, Australia, between 6 and 57 m depth, to create explanatory models linking relative fish abundance, species richness, and species composition with reef habitat factors. Generalised linear mixed modelling revealed that total fish abundance and species richness increased with small-scale structural complexity and biological cover. Reefs with greater density of surrounding reef substrate also had increased species richness. Although depth did not influence fish abundance or species richness, a multivariate analysis showed that it did influence species composition, with a decline in herbivores and omnivores with depth compensated by a general increase in other groups. The response of species composition to habitat factors was measured using multivariate generalised linear modelling and latent variable modelling. We found a weak response to depth and habitat complexity, but the lack of strong patterns and correlation between fish species shows that reefs within the similar to 300 km(2) of coastline investigated here are difficult to classify based on habitat-driven patterns in their associated fish assemblages.

Since energy losses in a cable depend on the load (i.e. wind), cable losses are estimated by considering a possibly large number wind scenarios. In order to deal with different wind scenarios efficiently we used a precomputing strategy. The resulting optimization problem considers two objectives: minimizing immediate costs (CAPEX) and minimizing costs due to power losses. This makes it possible to perform various what-if analyses to evaluate the impact of different preferences to CAPEX versus reduction of power losses.

In this respect, the aggregative effect of sea cages on wild fish populations is analogous to the effect of fish aggregation devices (FADs). High food availability, chiefly through loss of aquacultural feed, greatly increases feeding opportunities in the vicinity of farms. This increased food availability leads to increases in condition of farm-associated wild fish. Negative effects of aggregation at fish farms are also possible. These include the modification of fat levels and fatty acid distribution in the tissues of wild fish, which may have consequences for spawning success and subsequent larval survival, and the increase of specific species of parasites.

The method uses a time series of observed and predicted 15-min average wind speeds at foreseen onshore- and offshore-wind farm locations. A Unit Commitment and Economic Dispatch (UG-ED) tool is adapted to allow for frequent revisions of conventional generation unit schedules, using information on current wind energy output and forecasts for the next 36 h. This is deemed the most faithful way of simulating actual operations and short-term planning activities for a system with large wind power penetration. The problem formulation includes ramp-rate constraints for generation schedules and for reserve activation, and minimum up-time and down-time of conventional units. Results are shown for a realistic future scenario of the Dutch power system. It is shown that problems such as insufficient regulating and reserve power-which are typically associated with the variablility and limited predictability of wind power-can only be assessed in conjunction with the specifies of the conventional generation system that wind power is integrated into. For the thermal system with a large share of combined heat and power (CHP) investigated here, wind power forecasting does not provide significant benefits for optimal unit commitment and dispatch.

The success of these AR's prompted research into low cost concrete and bamboo modular structures. This paper describes the catches of artisanal fishermen from three low cost, modular AR's and compares them with catches from nearby natural reefs (NR's). The cumulative total earnings made from each of the three AR's during the study period suggest that modular AR's are an economical viable option for artisanal communities wishing to create habitat for fisheries purposes. Comparable0 mean CPUE values with associated large variances were obtained from AR's and NR's in all three villages. The catch from the NR's in all three villages was dominated by Balistidae. Lutjanidae, Nemipteridae, Sepidae, and Synodonatidae were abundant in the catches from the AR's in two of the three villages, while in the third the catch was composed largely of Carangidae. The majority of fish caught from the NR's in all three villages were resident varieties, with lesser numbers of temporary and non resident fish respectively. Although no clear pattern of reef association was observed for fish caught from the AR's it is argued that three newly created habitats attract fish which could support an artisanal fishery sector. Developments in community management of AR's necessary to ensure that such a fishery is sustainable are briefly discussed.",,,,,,,,,5,0,0,0,2,0,5,,,0007-4977,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1994-09-01,WOS:A1994QB58400062,,

However, the increasing pressures upon the marine realm threaten marine ecosystems, especially seabed biotopes, and thus a well-planned approach of managing use of marine space is essential to achieve sustainability. The relative value of seabed biotopes, evaluated on the basis of goods and services, is an important starting point for the spatial management of marine areas. Herein, 56 types of European seabed biotopes and their related goods, services, sensitivity issues, and conservation status were compiled, the latter referring to management and protection tools which currently apply for these biotopes at European or international level. Fishing activities, especially by benthic trawls, and marine pollution are the main threats to European seabed biotopes. Increased seawater turbidity, dredged sediment disposal, coastal constructions, biological invasions, mining, extraction of raw materials, shipping-related activities, tourism, hydrocarbon exploration, and even some practices of scientific research, also exert substantial pressure. Although some first steps have been taken to protect the European sea beds through international agreements and European and national legislation, a finer scale of classification and assessment of marine biotopes is considered crucial in shaping sound priorities and management guidelines towards the effective conservation and sustainability of European marine resources.",,,,,,,,,117,0,0,0,79,0,118,,,1108-393X,,,,,,,,,,,"HCMR, Anavyssos 19013, GreeceEuropean Commiss, Joint Res Ctr, Inst Environm & Sustainabil, Ispra, ItalyAZTI Tecnalia Marine Res Div, Pasaia 20110, SpainGhent Univ UGent, Dept Biol, B-9000 Ghent, BelgiumEuropean Commiss, Joint Res Ctr, IPSC Maritime Affairs Unit, I-21027 Ispra, VA, ItalyMRRA, Capture Fisheries Sect, Ft San Lucjan 1283, Marsaxlokk Bbg, MaltaUOS Messina, CNR, IAMC, I-98122 Messina, ItalyCNR, IAMC, I-91014 Castellammare Del Golfo, TP, ItalyBulgarian Acad Sci, Inst Oceanol, Varna 9000, Bulgaria",MRRA,,,2012-06-01,WOS:000306303500006,,

Each reef consisted of 12 concrete blocks (20 cm long x 20 cm wide x 41 cm high) arranged on a plywood base (1.5 m(2)) and deployed on the bottom, 20 m deep. To quantify the epibenthic assemblage on the reefs, four removable bricks were attached to the reefs. Ten reefs were coated with copper-based, anti-fouling paint and 10 reefs were unpainted. Fish and epibenthic assemblages were compared between reef treatments (i.e., with and without copper-based paint). Reefs were surveyed 1 week after deployment in October 2005, then again in December 2005, May 2006, August 2006, and December 2006. During each survey, two scuba divers visually estimated the densities of all fish species and removed one of the removable bricks to identify and quantify the epibenthic organisms. The epibenthos (coverage area, biomass, diversity, species richness) and fish assemblages (total fish density, species diversity, species richness) were greater on unpainted reefs. Red Snapper Lutjanus campechanus, wrasses Halichoeres spp., Bank Sea Bass Centropristis ogurus, and Atlantic Spadefish Chaetodipterus faber had higher densities on unpainted reefs.

The artificial reef of Fregene was selected because benthic assemblage data were available for the period 1981-1992. This artificial reef is located in the mid Tyrrhenian Sea, 5 nautical miles north of the two mouths of the Tevere River (Latium, Italy) and 1.5 nautical miles offshore from Fregene (Rome, Italy). The artificial reef was deployed in March 1981 for fisheries enhancement in 10-14 m of water on a sandy-silty seabed. The Tevere River carries suspended materials and a heavy load of organics since it transports Rome's effluent, resulting in the eutrophic state of area waters. Benthic sampling was conducted in 2001 by SCUBA diving; two standard surfaces of 400 cm 2 were scraped from the vertical walls of the same uppermost block in four different periods. All organisms were identified and counted. The methodology used is the same as that adopted in the previous periods, so that the 2001 data could be compared with past collected data. The benthic assemblage was analysed by cluster analysis using the Bray-Curtis index and clustered using the group average clustering algorithm. The SIMPER procedure was used to identify those taxa that characterize each station group identified by cluster analysis. Changes in benthic assemblages and hydrological trends of the Tevere River were investigated using the cumulative sum series method. The 20-year development of the benthic community, starting from the new substratum, is composed of different phases characterised by different benthic assemblages. In particular five different phases were distinguished: 1. Pioneer species recruitment (May 1981-June 1981); 2. Mytilus galloprovincialis (mussel) dominance (August 1981-November 1983); 3. M. galloprovincialis regression (July 1984-October 1985); 4. M. galloprovincialis absence (91-92); 5. Bryozoans bioconstruction dominance (2001). The dynamic succession of the observed benthic assemblages exhibited a good relation with the Tevere River flow. The Tevere River flow, and the subsequent sedimentation process, seems to have strongly influenced the benthic assemblage succession of the Fregene artificial reef.",,,,,39th European Marine Biology Symposium39th European Marine Biology Symposium,"JUL 21-24, 2004JUL 21-24, 2004",Univ Genoa; Italian Soc Marine BiolUniv Genoa; Italian Soc Marine Biol,"Genoa, ITALYGenoa, ITALY",43,1,0,0,37,1,47,,,0018-8158,,,,,,,,,,,"ICRAM, I-30000100 Rome, ItalyUniv Roma La Sapienza, I-00161 Rome, Italy",ICRAM,,,2007-04-01,WOS:000245895800021,,

Schools of fish are frequently attracted by reefs and it will gradually create artificial ecosystems. Therefore, reef deployment has been regarded as an effective method for resolving the depletion of inshore fishing and enriching marine resources. Actually previous studies on artificial reefs have examined the correlation between their configuration and fish aggregation effects through statistical analyses of field observations. However, because of high deployment costs, few studies were conducted to explore the influence of reef layouts on artificial reef flow fields. Typically, the way for reef deployment is often the crucial factor that determines whether reef blocks demonstrate their maximum function of fish aggregation. Thus, instead of employing experimental and field observations, CFD flow simulation approach was used in the present study to investigate the effects of layout changes on the flow field surrounding reefs. To conclude, the numerical results should benefit marine biologists and ocean engineers by revealing various flow patterns of different reef blocks layouts to consolidate the deployment strategy of artificial reefs.

The BTM project deploys and maintains for community use, a deep-sea mooring which is available for long-term testing of oceanographic sensors and systems. The project is has three major complementary facets: 1) technology development, 2) facilitation of the BTM for other groups developing and testing new technologies, and 3) scientific studies. The premise is that newly developed technology and instrumentation should be synergistic with scientific applications. Interdisciplinary time-series data collected from the mooring may be compared, calibrated, and interpreted using comprehensive shipboard data sets routinely collected near the site. Many of the sensors and systems developed and tested on the BTM will be suitable for deployment on other platforms such as drifters, autonomous underwater vehicles, and offshore structures. BTM is deployed near the Bermuda Time Series (BATS) station, a site that has been sampled continuously for over 15 years and provides a rich historic data base at the location. The mooring was first deployed in June, 1994 and has been used by a variety of scientists since its first deployment, as evidenced by numerous letters of support. In addition to maintaining the mooring as a testbed facility, two new instrument systems, SAFIRE and HiROS will be tested. SAFIRE measures spectral fluorescence and absorption and will be useful for optically characterizing and discriminating particulate components and dissolved organic constituents. The HiROS system will allow high resolution characterization and quantification of inherent optical properties. A new real-time data telemetry system under development will be tested as well. The PIs will continue to solicit new BTM users, to facilitate the usage of the BTM for all investigators, and to provide baseline interdisciplinary measurements.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,9730471,,,,,,,,University of California-Santa Barbara,,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:14016966,,

This industry has the potential to be worth £2billion annually by 2025 in the UK alone according to studies for the Crown Estate. At present most Operation and Maintenance (O&M) is still undertaken manually onsite. Remote monitoring through advanced sensing, robotics, data-mining and physics-of-failure models therefore has significant potential to improve safety and reduce costs.Typically 80-90% of the cost of offshore O&M according to the Crown Estate is a function of accessibility during inspection - the need to get engineers and technicians to remote sites to evaluate a problem and decide what remedial action to undertake. Minimising the need for human intervention offshore is a key route to maximising the potential, and minimising the cost, for offshore low-carbon generation. This will also ensure potential problems are picked up early, when the intervention required is minimal, before major damage has occurred and when maintenance can be scheduled during a good weather window. As the Crown Estate has identified: There is an increased focus on design for reliability and maintenance in the industry in general, but the reality is that there is a still a long way to go. Wind turbine, foundation and electrical elements of the project infrastructure would all benefit from innovative solutions which can demonstrably reduce O&M spending and downtime. Recent, more detailed, academic studies support this position.The wind farm is however an extremely complicated system-of-systems consisting of the wind turbines, the collection array and the connection to shore. This consists of electrical, mechanical, thermal and materials engineering systems and their complex interactions. Data needs to be extracted from each of these, assessed as to its significance and combined in models that give meaningful diagnostic and prognostic information. This needs to be achieved without overwhelming the user. Unfortunately, appropriate multi-physics sensing schemes and reliability models are a complex and developing field, and the required knowledge base is presently scattered across a variety of different UK universities and subject specialisms.This project will bring together and consolidate theoretical underpinning research from a variety of disparate prior research work, in different subject areas and at different universities. Advanced robotic monitoring and advanced sensing techniques will be integrated into diagnostic and prognostic schemes which will allow improved information to be streamed into multi-physics operational models for offshore windfarms. Life-time, reliability and physics of failure models will be adapted to provide a holistic view of wind-farms system health and include these new automated information flows. While aspects of the techniques required in this offshore application have been previously used in other fields, they are innovative for the complex problems and harsh environment in this offshore system-of-systems. 'Marinising' these methods is a substantial challenge in itself. The investigation of an integrated monitoring platform and the reformulation of models and techniques to allow synergistic use of data flow in an effective and efficient diagnostic and prognostic model is ambitious and would allow a major step change over present practice.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,EP/P009743/1,,,,,,,,University of Manchester,,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:15372126,,

This increasing complexity leads to limits in developing and managing the different and often spatially overlapping maritime activities independently of one another. On a showcase basis we discuss ways and manners as well as the preconditions of an offshore co-management approach for the fledgling actor groups offshore wind farmers and mariculturists. Both groups may benefit through the integration of operation and maintenance (O&M) activities. Their resources in terms of offers, needs and constraints characteristics and thereof deduced potentialities for interaction is a prerequisite for initiating a co-management process. This process is more likely to develop and Succeed if an interface management that acts as a moderator, disclosing the interests of the actor groups and offering possibilities for concerted action, guides it. It is concluded that such an institutional arrangement may in the long term contribute to a sound methodological tool for a co-management approach between different offshore maritime sectors.

The high concentration and diversity of fish around the artificial reefs is surprising, considering the low abundance of potential benthic prey. We investigated the diet and food partitioning between the aforementioned species using stomach content and stable isotope analyses (delta C-13, delta N-15). Priacanthus hamrur and S. crumenophthalmus fed on a larger prey diversity and showed significant overlap in their diets, with crustacean larvae the dominant prey. Fish larvae dominated L. kasmira's diet, and delta N-15 values confirmed the species' higher trophic level. Differences in delta C-13 between P. hamrur and S. crumenophthalmus indicated niche segregation, probably as a way to reduce competition, with P. hamrur being characterised by a smaller delta C-13 range and exhibiting a smaller isotopic niche than S. crumenophthalmus. There was a significant correlation between delta N-15 and fish standard length for the three species, suggesting that ontogeny partially explained the niche breadth.

Small demersal reef fishes, the predominant prey of lionfish in other systems, displayed the greatest declines. However, a confounding factor during this time was the Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill (DWH) in summer 2010. In some areas, targeted lionfish removals have been demonstrated to mitigate negative effects on native fishes. Therefore, we conducted a 2 yr experiment to examine the effectiveness and ecological benefits of targeted lionfish removals at artificial reefs (n = 27) off northwest Florida, USA, where lionfish densities reached the highest recorded in the western Atlantic by 2013. All lionfish were removed via spearfishing from 17 reefs in December 2013, 9 of which were periodically re-cleared of lionfish through May 2015. Remaining sites served as uncleared controls. Both juvenile and adult lionfish quickly recruited to cleared reefs, with lionfish reaching pre-clearance densities in < 1 yr on reefs cleared only once. Removal treatment significantly affected reef fish community structure at experimental reefs, but removal effort was insufficient to achieve substantial gains for most taxa, and declines in several taxa were observed throughout, regardless of treatment. It is unclear whether chronic effects of the DWH or regionally high lionfish densities were more important factors in explaining trends observed in reef fish communities, but small-scale targeted lionfish removal efforts had few positive impacts overall on native reef fish communities in this study.",,,,,,,,,48,0,0,0,46,1,53,,,0171-8630,1616-1599,,,,,,,,,,"Univ S Alabama, Dauphin Isl Sea Lab, 101 Bienville Blvd, Dauphin Isl, AL 36528 USAUniv West Florida, 100 Univ Pkwy, Pensacola, FL 32514 USAVirginia Inst Marine Sci, Eastern Shore Lab, Wachapreague, VA 23410 USA",,,,2016-10-25,WOS:000387116200017,,

We developed and applied a multi-species, individual-based model to examine the long-term effects of increasing number of reefs on fish weight, abundance, and biomass. The model simulated the population dynamics of three fish species for 50 years on a 2-dimensional spatial grid. Growth, mortality, and movement were computed each hour for individuals of red snapper (Lutjanus campechanus), a croaker-like species (Micropogonias chromis), and a pinfish-like species (Lagodon rhomboides). We also included individuals of two other species (bluefish - Pomatomus saltatrix and a generic jack-like species), but only simulated their hourly movement and their effects on prey and predation of the focal species. The densities of five prey groups were simulated independently in each cell. Our results showed that increasing the number of reefs generally produced higher biomass, but at the cost of slower growth, and smaller individuals. Abundance was higher under fixed-AR recruitment and maximum refuge treatments. In all treatments there were diminishing returns on abundance and biomass with increasing number of artificial reefs. Experiment 2 showed that model results based on regularly spaced reefs were consistent with a real layout of reefs currently being sampled in the northern Gulf of Mexico. Management strategies for determining the habitat-value of reefs in the Gulf of Mexico should consider the number of reefs and the local spatial layout of the reefs to ensure they are optimally arranged. Field experiments performed should assist in resolving how fish recruit to artificial reefs and help determine their roles as fish refuges.

Our results indicate that YOY red snapper have a strong affinity for structure, which ranged in these experiments from open-sand bottom to concrete-block, artificial reef-like habitats. Mean distance of YOY red snapper from the blocks decreased significantly and the time spent near the structures increased significantly as the size of the habitat increased. However, when larger subadult snapper were present, both distances to the reefs and time that YOY spent near them was significantly reduced, as the larger conspecifics actively defended the structure from occupation by YOY. If similar interactions occur in situ, small snapper that attempt to move onto reefs from the shrimping grounds that serve as nursery areas for juveniles may be subject to predation pressures by piscivorous fishes inhabiting the reefs. Finally, in experiments that used both larger conspecifics and alternate prey similar in size to the YOY red snapper, results indicated that larger snapper preferentially consumed the alternate prey and did not cannibalize the YOY red snapper. Nevertheless, YOY still were not permitted to occupy the artificial reef habitats in any experiments when larger conspecifics were present in the tanks. If results of these experiments are exportable to the field, they may partially explain the observation that YOY red snapper in natural populations are more often found in shallower water on shrimping grounds, whereas larger juveniles begin to recruit to the offshore reefs once they have obtained a size refuge. If additional studies conclude that YOY red snapper are attracted to larger or more complex habitats but avoid these structures because of pressure from larger juveniles and/or adults, the strategy of continued placement of artificial reefs large enough to attract adult snapper and other piscivores in and near the inshore shrimping grounds should be reassessed.",,,,,,,,,24,0,0,0,22,0,29,,,1087-688X,,,,,,,,,,,"Coastal Fisheries Institute, Louisina State University, Baton Rogue, LA, 70803-7503, USA",,,,2001-12-01,BCI:BCI200200169657,,

The development of these facilities will unavoidably exert environmental pressures on marine ecosystems. It is therefore crucial that the economic costs, the use of marine space and the environmental impacts of these activities remain within acceptable limits. Moreover, the installation of arrays of wave energy devices is still far from being economically feasible due to many combined aspects, such as immature technologies for energy conversion, local energy storage and moorings. Therefore, multi-purpose solutions combining renewable energy from the sea (wind, wave, tide), aquaculture and transportation facilities can be considered as a challenging, yet advantageous, way to boost blue growth. This would be due to the sharing of the costs of installation and using the produced energy locally to feed the different functionalities and optimizing marine spatial planning. This paper focuses on the synergies that may be produced by a multi-purpose offshore installation in a relatively calm sea, i.e., the Northern Adriatic Sea, Italy, and specifically offshore Venice. It analyzes the combination of aquaculture, energy production from wind and waves, and energy storage or transfer.

A relatively new form of shoreline protection, referred to as hybrid stabilization, incorporates created marsh in combination with a stabilizing structure such as a low-profile stone sill and is being implemented in many US coastal states as a means to not only control erosion but also to restore coastal habitat. However, there has been limited scientific investigation of ecological benefits and impacts associated with implementation of hybrid stabilization. We evaluated relative habitat capacity of marsh-sills by comparing plant, sediment, and benthic macroinvertebrate attributes in intertidal and subtidal zones of existing marsh-sills, natural marshes, tidal flats, and riprap revetment within two subestuaries of Chesapeake Bay, USA. Low and high marsh plant characteristics (stem count and height) of marsh-sills were similar to or greater than natural marshes. However, sediment was coarser, total organic carbon and total nitrogen concentrations were lower, and benthic macrofaunal community structure differed in marsh-sills compared to natural marshes. Marsh-sills supported lower deposit-feeding infaunal biomass than marshes in the intertidal. Epifaunal suspension-feeders were most prevalent at sites with artificial structure (riprap and marsh-sill), but highly variable among subestuaries. Infaunal abundance, biomass, diversity, and proportion of suspension/interface and deposit feeding animals were greater in shallow subtidal than in intertidal environments. Conversion of existing habitat to marsh-sills may cause localized loss of benthic productivity and sediment bioturbation and nutrient-cycling functions, with the opportunity to enhance filtration capacity by epifaunal recruitment to structures. When creating marshes that require structural support, there should be a balance of minimizing loss of existing habitats while encouraging use of suitable structural habitat for suspension-feeders. If properly implemented, the addition of structural habitat could subsidize secondary productivity particularly in areas where loss of complex biogenic habitat (e.g., oyster reefs) has occurred.

The goals of the construction projects were to improve sportfishing opportunity in nearshore waters, evaluate the effectiveness of reefs as fish-concentration devices, and eventually assist other coastal communities in developing artificial reef programs. From 1992 to 1995, we conducted evaluations to assess the effectiveness of these artificial reefs as sport fish attractors and to establish their Value in sport fishery enhancement projects. Underwater VHS video was used by scuba divers to identify and enumerate fish at both artificial reef sites and at adjacent nonreef control sites. Observation dives were done monthly, weather permitting, from May through October each year. T-tests were used to determine seasonal differences in fish abundance between the reef and control sites. At both sites, total seasonal numbers of fish were significantly higher (20-50 times more) at the reef site than the control site (p = 0.05). Smallmouth bass Micropterus dolomieu were the dominant species at both reef sites, comprising over 80% of the observations during most months. Total seasonal numbers of smallmouth bass were also higher during spring and fall than in midsummer, suggesting seasonal patterns and preferences for artificial structure. We conclude that, when properly planned and located, artificial reefs would provide beneficial fish habitat along most of Lake Erie's nearshore zone and may have application Great Lakes-wide.",,,,,Sea Grant Symposium on Fish Habitat - Essential Fish Habitat and Rehabilitation at the 1998 Annual Meeting of the American-Fisheries-SocietySea Grant Symposium on Fish Habitat - Essential Fish Habitat and Rehabilitation at the 1998 Annual Meeting of the American-Fisheries-Society,"AUG 26-27, 1998AUG 26-27, 1998",Amer Fisheries SocAmer Fisheries Soc,"HARTFORD, CTHARTFORD, CT",6,0,0,0,3,0,6,,,0892-2284,,1-888569-12-3,,,,,,,,,"Ohio State Univ, Ohio Sea Grant Coll Program, Columbus, OH 43212 USA",,,,1998-01-01,WOS:000082192300025,,

Eight qualitative visual surveys and eight quantitative photogrammetric surveys were used to estimate the impact of the hurricane on the natural reefs. The forereef slope of the offshore (5 km offshore) reef, between 17 and 29 m, was most heavily affected with lessor levels of damage occurring on the middle (4 km offshore) reef and least loss of organisms noted on the inner (2.5 km offshore) reef. The impact to the hard coral, soft coral, sponge and algal components varied on a given reef tract. The algal community consistently showed the greatest loss (40 to >90%) of benthic cover. The sponge community was slightly (0-25%) to heavily (50-75%) impacted, showing the greatest loss on the offshore reef and least on the inshore reef. Soft corals showed a similar trend with 25-50% loss and 0-25% on the offshore and inshore reef, respectively. Hard corals were least affected with a moderate loss of benthic cover (38%) on the offshore reef and slight loss (<23%) on the other inner two reefs. The effect of the storm on artificial reefs (i.e., steel vessels, prefabricated modules, concrete structures) varied greatly. Impacts ranged from no impact, to movement, to partial or total structural modification.

Recent research, however, suggests the most complex habitats may not harbor the highest density of individuals and number of species, especially in areas with elevated human influence. Understanding nuances in relationships between habitat heterogeneity and ecological communities is warranted to guide habitat-focused conservation and management efforts. We conducted fish and structural habitat surveys of thirty warm-temperate reefs on the southeastern US continental shelf to quantify how structural complexity influences fish communities. We found that intermediate complexity maximizes fish abundance on natural and artificial reefs, as well as species richness on natural reefs, challenging the current paradigm that abundance and other fish community metrics increase with increasing complexity. Naturally occurring rocky reefs of flat and complex morphologies supported equivalent abundance, biomass, species richness, and community composition of fishes. For flat and complex morphologies of rocky reefs to receive equal consideration as essential fish habitat (EFH), special attention should be given to detecting pavement type rocky reefs because their ephemeral nature makes them difficult to detect with typical seafloor mapping methods. Artificial reefs of intermediate complexity also maximized fish abundance, but human-made structures composed of low-lying concrete and metal ships differed in community types, with less complex, concrete structures supporting lower numbers of fishes classified largely as demersal species and metal ships protruding into the water column harboring higher numbers of fishes, including more pelagic species. Results of this study are essential to the process of evaluating habitat function provided by different types and shapes of reefs on the seafloor so that all EFH across a wide range of habitat complexity may be accurately identified and properly managed.

These modifications could, in time, be highly beneficial to any programme of fishery enhancement, protection or restoration but only where the scale of habitat manipulation was relevant to the target fisheries. Ecosystem simulations provide a theoretical basis on which to conduct examinations of habitat manipulation at scales that could not be tested empirically. In the present study, a series of ecosystem models was constructed based on broad-scale simulations for the west coast of Scotland in order to examine the potential consequences to selected fisheries of different scales and types of intervention using artificial reefs. Initialized with a large-scale mass-balance model, a number of smaller-scale dynamic ecosystem simulations covered management situations that encompassed habitat type and reef design for open, restricted and closed fisheries. Spatial simulations examined the presence and absence of artificial habitat with natural reefs and marine protected areas (MPAs) under realistic environmental situations. The simulated trends supported preliminary field observations that artificial habitats would support similar biotic aggregations to natural reefs. Designs that maximized the reef edge as a function of the total reef volume were more productive for some of the functional groups examined compared with larger single deployments of identical area. Increasing the area of artificial habitat did result in improvements to some of the fisheries. The behaviour of some functional groups, however, highlighted the limitations of the broad-scale primary model to smaller-scale investigation. Future simulations used to inform management decision at the sub-regional level would require evidence-based revision to improve their relevance.

This project will analyze many hundreds of diver and remotely operated underwater vehicle photographs documenting a unique, episodic settlement event that occurred between 2000 and 2010 in McMurdo Sound that challenges this paradigm of slow growth. Artificial structures were placed on the seafloor between 1967 and 1974 at several sites, but no sponges were observed to settle on these structures until 2004. By 2010 some 40 species of sponges had settled and grown to be surprisingly large. Given the paradigm of slow settlement and growth supported by the long observation period (37 years, 1967-2004), this extraordinary large-scale settlement and rapid growth over just a 6-year time span is astonishing. This project utilizes image processing software (ImageJ) to obtain metrics (linear dimensions to estimate size, frequency, percent cover) for sponges and other fauna visible in the photographs. It uses R to conduct multidimensional scaling to ordinate community data and ANOSIM to test for differences of community data among sites and times and structures. It will also use SIMPER and ranked species abundances to discriminate species responsible for any differences. This work focuses on Antarctic sponges, but the observations of massive episodic recruitment and growth are important to understanding seafloor communities worldwide. Ecosystems are composed of populations, and populations are ecologically described by their distribution and abundance. A little appreciated fact is that sponges often dominate marine communities, but because sponges are so hard to study, most workers focus on other groups such as corals, kelps, or bivalves. Because most sponges settle and grow slowly their life history is virtually unstudied. The assumption of relative stasis of the Antarctic seafloor community is common, and this project will shatter this paradigm by documenting a dramatic episodic event. Finally, the project takes advantage of old transects from the 1960s and 1970s and compares them with extensive 2010 surveys of the same habitats and sometimes the same intact transect lines, offering a long-term perspective of community change. The investigators will publish these results in peer-reviewed journals, give presentations to the general public and will involve students from local outreach programs, high schools, and undergraduates at UCSD to help with the analysis.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,1355533,,,,,,,,University of California-San Diego Scripps Inst of Oceanography,,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:13762967,,

For this reason, a comprehensive system analysis of the possible CO2 reduction including the consideration of all relevant processes has to be performed. This goal can be achieved by linking a life-cycle assessment model of offshore wind utilisation with a stochastic model of the German electricity market. Such an extended life-cycle assessment shows that the CO2 emissions from the construction and operation of wind farms are low compared with the substitution effects of fossil fuels. Additionally, ill the German electricity system, offshore wind energy is the main substitute for medium-load power plants. CO2 emissions from the modified operation and the expansion of conventional power plants reduce the CO2 savings, but the substitution effect outweighs these emissions by one order of magnitude. The assumptions of the model, shown here to be above all CO2 certificate prices, have a considerable influence oil the figures shown due to a significant effect oil the future energy mix.
