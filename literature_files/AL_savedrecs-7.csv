Destructive and non-destructive sampling methods were used to determine fish species and number in the site in this study. As destructive sampling methods, both combined gill net-trammel net and hand line, and visual census method as a non-destructive method were used. At the end of the study 2241 individuals belonging 60 fish species were determined. 392 individuals belonging 27 fish species were caught using combined gill net-trammel net. 102 fishes belonging 6 species were caught with hand line. 1747 fishes of 27 fish species were visually censused in experiments. 5 species were sampled by each sampling methods. The most determined fish with the number of 450 using visual census technique is Chromis chromis (Lin. 1758). Balistes carolinensis (Gmelin, 1789), Lophius piscatorius (Lin., 1758) (sampled combined gill net-trammel net), Conger conger (Lin. 1758) and Symphodus doderleini (Jordan, 1891) (visual census technique) have only 1 individual able to sampled. Among the 3 sampling methods, combined gill net-trammel net and visual census technique were more effective methods so as to evaluate fish diversity in the site. Visual census technique is the most efficient method to estimate number of fishes in the artificial reef site. In addition, it was more effective in order to determine some cryptic fishes such as Symphodus doderleini (Jordan, 1891) and Parablennius rouxi (Cocco, 1833) in the reef site. Although sampling of hand line is not efficiently, it should be used as a supportive method in sampling experiments because of having high selectivity. When the results were evaluated statistically using spss, kruskall-wallis analysis, according to number of individuals sampled, visual census technique is different from the other 2 methods (p < 0.05). Due to destructive methods (fishing net, fishing line, pots etc.) give possibility to reach data accurately in order to estimate biomass in artificial reef sites, these should be used to support visual census method.

Casitas - concrete, low-relief, artificial shelters - are effective in aggregating lobsters, and are used to harvest spiny lobster in the Caribbean. However, casitas may also enhance populations of P. argus, by providing shelter from predation. In this study we examined the effects of various shelter features upon the survival of juvenile P. argus. Juvenile lobsters were tethered at several artificial shelter treatments in Florida Bay, Florida, USA, to test the efficacy of casitas as refuge from predation. Survival of juveniles was analyzed with respect to 4 shelter types (2 casita sizes, a simulated natural shelter and a no-shelter control) within 2 locations in Florida Bay. In general, casita availability significantly increased survival. The geographic location of artificial shelter placement also significantly affected survival; the degree of survival enhancement was apparently linked to the availability of natural shelter. Furthermore, there was a quantitative relationship between lobster survival and lobster abundance within shelters, which was tempered by local predation pressure. Survival of tethered individuals was highest when the number of conspecifics was high and predator abundance was low. While larger shelters allowed for larger lobster aggregations and usually contained more lobsters, lobsters tethered to large shelters that contained relatively few conspecifics sustained higher mortality, probably due to their increased vulnerability to larger casita-associated predators. Thus, the survival of juvenile P. argus is controlled not only by physical features of the shelter, but also by the relative abundance of conspecifics and predators in shelter-providing habitats.",,,,,,,,,93,0,0,0,59,0,106,,,0171-8630,1616-1599,,,,,,,,,,"CARIBBEAN MARINE RES CTR, LEE STOCKING ISL, BAHAMAS",CARIBBEAN MARINE RES CTR,,,1994-09-01,WOS:A1994PM40500006,,

At the same time, qualitative visual observations were carried out by scuba divers at the reef to obtain information independent of catch samples. Objectives were to evaluate the effectiveness of the sample gear as a descriptor of the reef community, to test the effectiveness of the artificial reef to enhance fish assemblage and yield and to evaluate these effects seasonally. Seasonal fluctuations in fish abundance were confirmed by visual observations at both sites. Lowest values were recorded in winter, when most of the species migrated to deeper and warmer waters. In spite of this, the average total yield was 10.9 kg.year(-1) at the artificial reef, compared to 8.1 kg.year(-1) at the control site and the difference was statistically significant. During the fishing survey the fish reported from the reef always exceeded in average weight those obtained from the control site. The influence of the reef was particularly apparent for nekto-benthic fish. In fact pelagic fish always dominated the fish catches at the control site. The same was true at the reef during the first two survey years. After that the nekto-benthic fish, mainly represented by partially and/or obligatory reef-dwelling species, such as sparids and sciaenids, gradually increased and reached the same importance as the pelagics. Conversely, no significant differences were recorded for molluscs and crustaceans between the two sites. Higher total species richness (S-t) mean species richness (S-m) and species diversity (H') were recorded at the artificial reef in comparison with the control sire. The difference was statistically significant for S-m and not significant for H'. Differences in the fish species composition were also recorded between fishing samplings and visual observations at the reef. Fewer species of fish, crustaceans and molluscs were recorded by visual observations than by trammel net. This last method better described the population of the original sandy-muddy bottom. Conversely the partially and obligatory reef-dwelling species were better recorded visually.",,,,,,,,,58,0,0,0,39,4,61,,,0007-4977,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1994-09-01,WOS:A1994QB58400024,,

Quantifying the use of artificial reefs by recreational boaters is essential for determining their value as ecosystem services. In this study, four artificial-natural reef pairs in the eastern Gulf of Mexico (off western Florida) were investigated for boat visitation rates using autonomous acoustic recorders. Digital SpectroGram (DSG) recorders were used to collect sound files from April 2013 to March 2015. An automatic detection algorithm was used to identify boat noise in individual files using the harmonic peaks generated by boat engines, and by comparing the sound amplitude of each file with surrounding files. In all four pairs, visitation rates were significantly higher at the artificial reef than the natural reef. This increase in boat visitation was likely due to actual or perceived increased quality of fishing and diving at the artificial reefs, or to lack of knowledge of the presence or locations of the natural reefs. Inshore reefs (< 15 m depth) had high variability in monthly visitation rates, which were generally highest in warmer months. However the seasonal signal was dampened on offshore reefs (> 25 m depth).

HI-A-389-A is located within Flower Garden Banks National Marine Sanctuary boundaries, near East Flower Garden Bank. The monitoring program is funded by NOAA's Flower Garden Banks National Marine Sanctuary and the Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement. The artificial structure is dominated by a fouling community comprised of sponges, hydroids, macroalgae, bivalves, barnacles, tunicates, zoanthids, bryozoans, and several stony coral species. The most abundant stony coral was an exotic species, orange cup coral (Tubastraea sp.), native to the Indo-Pacific. Analysis of the benthic community suggests four distinct biological zones occur, likely driven by light availability, wave action, temperature, and sedimentation. Significant changes in the biological community were reported after the removal of the working deck and associated equipment above water, which served as shade structure. The loss of hydroids documented from pre- to post-removal surveys was the most significant difference in the benthic community. Fish species on the platform were primarily invertivores, illustrating a strong link to food sources, given the dominant benthic community. Fishery acoustic surveys documented individual and schools of fish in close proximity to the platform during both pre- and post-removal surveys. Fish were observed throughout the water column prior to removal. Following removal, schools of fish were no longer present in the upper water column, but were present at depth. The water surrounding the platform had minimal changes from 2016 to 2019 and was characteristic of typical open ocean water with seasonal fluctuations.

The objectives of this study were (1) to document the fish assemblages on the mussel reefs, (2) to investigate the spatial patterns of use of parts of mussel reefs by various fish species and (3) to compare species assemblages, population densities and fish sizes on the mussel reefs with those on adjacent platform bottoms. We observed at least 35 species on the mussel mounds, 18 of which were rockfishes (genus Sebastes). Most of the species that were found both in large numbers and were encountered at a number of mussel mounds were solitary, benthic forms. Most species appeared to be non-randomly distributed among parts of the mussel mounds with different percent shell cover. All species combined and all rockfish species tended to be slightly but significantly over-represented on areas of 80-100% cover (all species: chi(2) = 227, n = 5, P < 0.001, all rockfishes: chi(2) = 211, n = 5, P < 0.001).

Islands? are the coral reefs and hard-bottom (also called hard substrate) biological communities found along the course of a massive stream of ocean currents connecting the Caribbean Sea, the Gulf of Mexico, and the western Atlantic off North America. This expedition emphasizes habitat characterization and an understanding of these islands' connection as parts of an interrelated ecosystem. Though separated by large expanses of ocean water, the fishes, corals, and invertebrates common to these islands may demonstrate that the health and vitality of downstream islands are linked closely to those located upstream.From August to October 2001, scientists explored the deep reef and hard-bottom communities of the South Atlantic Bight, from the east coast of Florida through the North Carolina Shelf. Leg One of this mission, lasting from August 29 to September 7, visited the Oculina Bank, situated 30 km (18 mi) east of the northern Florida coast. Oculina Bank was the first deep-water site in federal waters off the U.S. Eastern Seaboard to be closed to fishing. Once, this area was covered with dense thickets of the ivory tree coral, Oculina varicosa, which provided excellent habitat for reef fish, such as grouper and wreckfish, and feeding grounds for migratory pelagic (deep-sea) species. However, fishing activities destroyed approximately two-thirds of the bank. A fragile and slow-growing coral, deep-water Oculina only grows about one-half inch per year. These and other damaged coral reefs will take many years, even decades, to recover. To aid in the recovery process, a significant portion of the area was closed to fishing in 1994. NOAA has since funded efforts to assess the banks and to attempt to restore the damaged areas. In July 2000, the National Marine Fisheries Service approved plans to expand the protected area, with the goal of saving the remaining ivory tree coral. Much of the protected area is deeper than 100 m (328 ft), rugged, and can only be studied using advanced undersea technologies. The mission will use the HBOI submersible Clelia and an ROV to study the recovery of the reserve. In addition to habitat characterization work, visual observations of artificial-reef restoration structures deployed on the banks beginning in 1995 will help to determine species' rates of recruitment.

During many years this small basin has received all the domestic and industrial sewage from a large region of St.-Petersburg County. The bottom sediments of this basin are sand and silt, and there are no hard substrates suitable for sessile fouling organisms. Other environmental and biological conditions of the Neva Bay are also nonfavorable for cultivation of rich communities of fouling invertebrates. Yet, the recent discovery of ''zebra mussels'' Dreissena polymorpha in nearby area waters allows this sessile bivalve to be considered as a tool for a bay clean-up effort. The idea being put forth here is to utilize massive numbers of filter feeders in a controlled environment of artificial reefs, to cleanse the waters through bioaccumulation. A 3-year scientific feasibility study is proposed here as a first step in the ecological enhancement of Neva Bay. It is envisioned that this program, taking advantage of the ecological role of the reef community, can affect the bay's natural cleansing capacity to improve the bay's water quality. The construction of special reefs must provide for their regular withdrawal to allow for the cleaning and disposal of the encrustations and accumulated substances from the aquatic ecosystem. Thus the design of this kind of modules, envisioned as large metal racks, must be very specific for their function, and rather distinct from reefs for fisheries.",,,,,,,,,13,2,0,0,12,2,15,,,0007-4977,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1994-09-01,WOS:A1994QB58400075,,

Hydrodynamic modeling of neither egg nor larval transport has been conducted for GOM red snapper; thus, the potential for planktonic dispersal among regions is currently unknown. However, recent studies of other reef fishes have demonstrated that larval fishes may not act as passive particles. Postsettlement movement, or the lack thereof, may be just as important for describing population connectivity and structure as planktonic transport. Red snapper juveniles display thigmotaxis and have been shown to undergo an ontogentic shift in which the dimension and complexity of their habitat increases with fish size. Tagging data demonstrate that while a substantial percentage of tagged fish were recaptured near their release sites, movement on the scale of hundreds of km also has been reported. Direct estimates of movement and population mixing from ultrasonic tagging, conventional tagging, and otolith chemistry studies indicate movement of some individuals may be sufficient to promote genetic exchange among regions, but overall movement is likely insufficient to affect population demographic differences observed among regions. Therefore, GOM red snapper meet criteria for consideration as a metapopulation: subpopulations are distinct, dispersal mechanisms exist among subpopulations, and asynchrony in population demographics is apparent among subpopulations.",,,,,Symposium on Fisheries Ecology of Gulf of Mexico Red SnapperSymposium on Fisheries Ecology of Gulf of Mexico Red Snapper,"FEB 10-12, 2006FEB 10-12, 2006","Sea Grant Louisiana; NOAA; Univ West Florida; Univ S Alabama; Louisiana State Univ, Coastal Fisheries InstSea Grant Louisiana; NOAA; Univ West Florida; Univ S Alabama; Louisiana State Univ, Coastal Fisheries Inst","San Antonio, TXSan Antonio, TX",22,0,0,0,22,0,30,,,0892-2284,,978-1-888569-97-1,,,,,,,,,"Univ W Florida, Dept Biol, Pensacola, FL 32514 USA",,,,2007-01-01,WOS:000253386500016,,

Submerged steel structures, including shipwrecks, serve as artificial reefs and become hotspots of biodiversity in the deep sea. Marine biofilms on submerged structures support settlement of micro- and macro-biota and may enhance and protect against corrosion. Disruptions in the local environment, including oil spills, may impact the role that biofilms play in reef preservation. To determine how the Deepwater Horizon spill potentially impacted shipwreck biofilms and the functional roles of the biofilm microbiome, experiments containing carbon steels disks (CSDs) were placed at five historic shipwreck sites located within, and external to the benthic footprint of the Deepwater Horizon spill. The CSDs were incubated for 16 weeks to enable colonization by biofilm-forming microorganisms and to provide time for in situ corrosion to occur. Biofilms from the CSDs, as well as sediment and water microbiomes, were collected and analyzed by 16S rRNA amplicon gene sequencing to describe community composition and determine the source of taxa colonizing biofilms. Biofilm metagenomes were sequenced to compare differential gene abundances at spill-impacted and reference sites. Biofilms were dominated by Zeta-, Alpha-, Epsilon-, and Gamma-proteobacteria. Sequences affiliated with the Mariprofundus and Sulfurimonas genera were prolific, and Roseobacter, and Colwellia genera were also abundant. Analysis of 16S rRNA sequences from sediment, water, and biofilms revealed sediment to be the main known source of taxa to biofilms at impacted sites. Differential gene abundance analysis revealed the two-component response regulator CreC, a gene involved in environmental stress response, to be elevated at reference sites compared to impacted sites within the spill plume fallout area on the seafloor. Genes for chemotaxis, motility, and alcohol dehydrogenases were differentially abundant at reference vs. impacted sites. Metal loss on CSDs was elevated at sites within the spill fallout plume. Time series images reveal that metal loss at a heavily impacted site, the German Submarine U-166, has accelerated since the spill in 2010. This study provides evidence that spill residues on the seafloor may impact biofilm communities and the preservation of historic steel shipwrecks.

Little is known however about early life history stages, such as the larval and newly settled stages of marine invertebrates. No one has captured wild larval or newly settled red abalone (Haliotis rufescens) in California even though this species supports a recreational fishery. A sampling program has been developed to capture larval (290 mu m), newly settled (290-2,000 mu m), and juvenile (2-20 mm) red abalone in northern California from 2007 to 2015. Plankton nets were used to capture larval abalone using depth integrated tows in nearshore rocky habitats. Newly settled abalone were collected on cobbles covered in crustose coralline algae. Larval and newly settled abalone were identified to species using shell morphology confirmed with genetic techniques using polymerase chain reaction restriction fragment length polymorphism with two restriction enzymes. Artificial reefs were constructed of cinder blocks and sampled each year for the presence of juvenile red abalone. Settlement and recruitment were found to vary with year and site from 2007 to 2015. In some years such as 2010 and 2013, there were many larvae and newly settled abalone, whereas in other years there were none. The two exceptionally poor years for larval and newly settled abalone were 2012 and 2015 (warm El Nino years). In 2013, there was spatial concordance between two sites 18 km apart with respect to the sizes of the newly settled individuals suggesting they were spawned and settled on the same day.

We used multiple regression analyses in the framework of generalized linear models (GLM), and a redundancy analysis (RDA) evaluated through a Monte Carlo permutation test with a 1% level of significance. A significant positive relationship was observed between habitat complexity as measured by the number of rocky boulders of several sizes, the number of species . 250 m(-2) (P < 0.05) and the mean total abundance (P < 0.001). Species diversity decreases with the increment of large boulder numbers, although the correlation is weak (adj. r(2) = 0.27, P < 0.05). The canonical ordination has discerned only the effect of depth on fish species composition, unrelated to the possible influence of habitat structure. Whether the observed response of the fish assemblage to changes of habitat structure is a consequence of the lack of available space (promoting competition for space as a potential driving force for structuring Mediterranean rocky reef fish assemblages), or whether it is due to a diversification of resources following the increase of habitat complexity, cannot be decided with an observational approach such as that used here. Two immediate implications of the present study are the adequacy of estimating habitat complexity by counting size-classified rocky boulders rather than measuring rugosity (perhaps a scale-related effect), and the fact that habitat heterogeneity has no apparent influence on parameters of the fish assemblage; the latter may reflect an inadequate sampling size (50 x 5 m transects) to quantify the effect of this aspect of habitat structure on species composition.

These effects are not limited to the immediate physical damage, but can have wide-spread and lasting impacts due to alteration of the chemical makeup of the surrounding water column. This can subsequently impact the growth of benthic organisms, often leading to phase shifts and high levels of mortality of corals in the vicinity of the wreck. At Palmyra atoll, the grounding of a longline fishing vessel on the shallow reef terrace is associated with a phase shift to the corallimorph, Rhodactis howesii. In 2013, a wreck removal effort initiated by the US Department of Fish and Wildlife resulted in the successful extraction and disposal of the wreckage, after which the density and percent cover of R. howesii in the immediate vicinity of the wreck site dropped precipitously. Here, we document the response of the fish community to the wreck removal and localized decline in R. howesii. We show that the biomass of scarid parrotfishes and acanthurid surgeonfishes and unicornfishes (primarily herbivores) increased after the removal of the wreck, while biomass of chaetodontid butterflyfishes (primarily invertivores, many species are known to feed on coelenterate polyps) declined over the study period. The density of small scarids and acanthurids also increased, but only after a few years post removal. Overall these results indicate that Palmyra's unfished herbivore population has rapidly responded to the removal of the wreck and associated decrease in corallimorph cover, can maintain high levels of grazing where space is made available for colonization of early successional algae species, and may have the potential to facilitate reef recovery.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,2296-7745,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Marine Sci Inst, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA",,,,2018-11-06,WOS:001046317100001,,

The anthropogenic disturbances of greatest interest in the Gulf of Mexico include fishing, hypoxia, red tide, oil and gas exploration, and climatic change.

Quantifying the response of mobile consumers to changes in habitat availability is essential for determining the degree to which population-level productivity is habitat limited rather than regulated by other, potentially density-independent factors. 2. Over landscape scales, this can be explored by monitoring changes in density and foraging as habitat availability varies. As habitat availability increases, densities may: (1) decrease (unit-area production decreases; weak habitat limitation); (2) remain stable (unit-area production remains stable; habitat limitation); or (3) increase (unit-area production increases; strong habitat limitation). 3. We tested the response of mobile estuarine consumers over five months to changes in habitat availability in situ by comparing densities and feeding rates on artificial reefs that were or were not adjacent to neighboring artificial reefs or nearby natural reefs). 4. Using either constructed or natural reefs to manipulate habitat availability, we documented three-fold density decreases among juvenile stone crabs as habitat increased (i.e. weak habitat imitation). However, for adult stone crabs, density remained stable across treatments, demonstrating that habitat limitation presents a bottleneck in this species later life history. Oyster toadfish densities also did not change with increasing habitat availability (i.e. habitat limitation), but densities of other cryptic fishes decreased as habitat availability increased (i.e. weak limitation). Feeding and abundance data suggested that some mobile fishes experience habitat limitation, or, potentially in one case, strong limitation across our habitat manipulations. 5. These findings of significant, community-level habitat limitation provide insight into how global declines in structurally complex estuarine habitats may have reduced the fishery production of coastal ecosystems.

In implementing sub-seabed CCS, detecting and monitoring the impact of the sequestered CO2 on the ocean environment is highly important. The first controlled CO2 release experiment, Quantifying and Monitoring Potential Ecosystem Impacts of Geological Carbon Storage (QICS), took place in Ardmucknish Bay, Oban, in May-September 2012.We applied the in situ pH/pCO(2) sensor to the QICS experiment for detection and monitoring of leaked CO2, and carried out several observations. The cabled real-time sensor was deployed close to the CO2 leakage (bubbling) area, and the fluctuations of in situ pH and pCO(2) above the seafloor were monitored in a land-based container. The long-term sensor was placed on seafloor in three different observation zones. The sediment pH sensor was inserted into the sediment at a depth of 50 cm beneath the seafloor near the CO2 leakage area. Wide-area mapping surveys of pH and pCO(2) in water column around the CO2 leakage area were carried out by using an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) installed with sensors. Atmospheric CO2 above the leakage area was observed by using a CO2 analyzer that was attached to the bow of ship of 50 cm above the sea-surface.The behavior of the leaked CO2 is highly dependent on the tidal periodicity (low tide or high tide) during the CO2 gas release period. At low tide, the pH in sediment and overlying seawater decreased due to strong eruption of CO2 gas bubbles, and the CO2 ascended to sea-surface quickly with a little dissolution to seawater and dispersed into the atmosphere. On the other hand, the CO2 bubbles release was lower at high tide due to higher water pressure, and slight low pH seawater and high atmospheric CO2 were detected. After stopping CO2 gas injection, no remarkable variations of pH in sediment and overlying water column were observed for three months. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

First, scientific monitoring tool and method should be introduced to the marine ranching project to carry out the above plans more efficiently. Second, local fishermen's voluntary participation and local government's active management efforts are necessary to settle marine ranching project successfully.",,,,"바다목장사업은 일정한 해역에 인공어조 조성 및 종묘 방류사업을 통해 경영안정화와 풍요로운 어촌 조성을 목적으로 하고 있다. 일본은 1984년 오이타현에서, 한국은 1998년 통영에서 처음 바다목장이 조성되었고 이를 통해 기존의 자원약탈형 어업에서 친환경적 방식의 지속가능한 어업으로 변화를 꾀하였다.일본에서 조성된 대표적 바다목장으로는 오이타현(大分県) 바다목장, 미에현(三重県) 바다목장, 후쿠이현(福井県) 바다목장, 나가사키현(長崎県) 바다목장 등이 있다. 우리나라는 어로형을 기본으로 한 시범바다목장을 통영Â·여수에 조성했고, 해양관광Â·레저기능이 부가된 ‘테마형’ 시범바다목장을 울진(관광형), 제주(체험Â·관광형), 태안(갯벌형)에 각각 조성하였다. 이들 중 사례분석 대상인 일본의 아바만 바다목장과 우리나라 통영 바다목장의 성과를 분석한 결과 바다목장 어획량은 기대보다 저조하였다.이는 바다목장사업 자체의 효과가 미비하여 발생할 가능성도 있지만 측정도구 및 측정방법의 미비로 수산자원 증식량을 정확히 측정하지 못한데 기인할 가능성이 더 높다고 사료된다. 이러한 문제점을 해소하기 위해서는 바다목장 해역에 대한 어종생태, 회유로, 분포 및 밀도를 현장조사를 통해 방류된 자원량의 증식효과를 과학적으로 확인 또는 재점검하는 조치가 필요하다. 또한 어업인 소득증대를 위해 적합한 방류어종 선정 및 방류 확대 사업 외에도 브랜드화를 통해 고부가가치화를 하는 노력도 추진해야 한다. 이를 위해서는 무엇보다 지자체의 적극적인 관리 노력과 지원, 그리고 어업인의 자율적인 참여와 적극적인 의지가 뒷받침되어야 할 것이다.",,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,1226-0215,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2015-04-16,KJD:ART001941684,,

Studies have demonstrated positive relationship between environmental heterogeneity and diversity, but evidence from marine ecosystems is controversial and scarce in terms of how spatial heterogeneity and diel period mediate this relationship. We used fish communities from four Southwestern Atlantic vessel reefs to assess whether positive heterogeneity-diversity relationships (HDR) hold for these mobile organisms and whether the relationships weaken with nightfall. We sampled fishes in three habitats of contrasting structural complexity (high, low and control), over day and night, and employed two complementary diversity frameworks: partitioning of gamma diversity into independent alpha and beta components (Jost's approach) and partitioning of beta diversity into turnover and nestedness components (Baselga's approach). We recorded 5005 fishes belonging to 76 species and 31 families. As expected, the mean alpha diversity of rare species (D-0) doubled from control to high complexity areas and decreased by half from day to night. The diversity of typical species (CD) also doubled from control to high complexity areas, but did not reduce at night. Complexity and diel period did not have significant effect on the diversity of dominant species (D-2). No relationship between complexity and alpha diversity was weakened at night. Beta diversity of the three diversity orders significantly differed from 1 (totally homogeneous vessel reef), indicating that complexity underlies patterns of beta diversity. This effect was consistent in both dial periods, contradicting expectations of weaker influence of complexity at night. The turnover component of beta diversity was consistently greater than nestedness at day and nigth (2.8 and 1.9-fold, respectively). Our findings support positive HDR for the diversity of rare and typical species. Dominant species also respond to heterogeneity by replacing each other across the complexity gradient, but not by becoming more numerous in high complexity areas. Dial changes did not affect the strenght of HDR, revealing an uninterrupted role of environmental heterogenity on fish communities. Conserving heterogeneous, structurally complex habitats is crucial for conserving marine fish diversity.",,,,,,,,,12,0,0,0,8,0,12,,,0022-0981,1879-1697,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Fed Paraiba, Programa Posgrad Ciencias Biol, BR-58051900 Joao Pessoa, Paraiba, BrazilUniv Fed Paraiba, Programa Posgrad Biodiversidade, Rodovia PB 079,Campus 2, BR-58397000 Areia, PB, BrazilUniv Fed Paraiba, Ctr Ciencias Exatas & Nat, Dept Sistemat & Ecol, BR-58051900 Joao Pessoa, Paraiba, Brazil",,,,2019-12-18,WOS:000500373400012,,

In the SW Atlantic, Campos Basin has been Brazil's main deep-sea area for oil and gas extraction since the 1980's, with currently over 11,000 km(2) of leased blocks below 200 m depth. The historical record of exploration and the lack of a basin wide management for the offshore industry in the SW Atlantic threaten the biodiversity and ecological function of vulnerable deep-sea ecosystems. This study identified habitats of biological interest on the Campos Basin and proposes relevant areas for conservation (EBSAs) that could be included in the first deep-sea Marine Protected Area (MPA) network in the South Atlantic. A total of 42 benthic habitats were mapped including cold-water coral reefs, submarine canyons, soft sediment slope and a seamount. Those habitats fill conservation criteria to be proposed as EBSAs along Campos Basin and could support a MPA network with a 5.5% overlap (2330 km(2)) to current leased blocks. If implemented, the MPA network would cover 31% of the Campos Basin and offer 31-100% protection of EBSAs with minimal interference on industry. This study is the first to identify EBSAs in a deep-sea basin of major economic importance in Brazil's EEZ and their conservation would also protect areas at two biogeographic provinces in the South Atlantic. Furthermore, the methods demonstrated here could be widely applied to other offshore oil and gas areas that lack environmental management measures at early stages of bidding rounds or during the process of environmental licensing.

Compared to Canada's landmass, only a limited portion of Canada's seafloor has been mapped using the modern technology of multibeam sonar. Where this high-resolution mapping technique has been applied on Canada's Atlantic continental margin, insight has been gained into the studies of seafloor habitat mapping, Quaternary history and sea-level change, sediment bedforms and dynamics, and seafloor conditions for in-stream tidal power. Seafloor habitat mapping in Canada provides the knowledge base to effectively manage offshore fisheries, evaluate marine protected areas, minimize the environmental impact of offshore development, and resolve seafloor-use conflicts. Multibeam sonar mapping has revealed a complex glacial landsystem, developed on the Canadian Atlantic continental shelf and supports the concept of the late glacial maximum reaching the shelf edge. The application of multibeam sonar technology offers unprecedented images of bedform geomorphology and this knowledge is crucial to understanding sediment mobility and its effect on seafloor habitat, engineering, and infrastructure. To minimize the risk to engineering infrastructure on the seabed, planning of tidal-energy developments in regions of large tidal range requires detailed information about the water depth, seafloor substrate and sediment mobility, and long-term seabed change garnered using multibeam. sonar mapping techniques.",,,,,,,,,5,0,0,0,3,0,5,,,0315-0941,,,,,,,,,,,"Geol Survey Canada Atlantic, Bedford Inst Oceanog, Nat Resources Canada, Dartmouth, NS B2Y 4A2, Canada",,,,2009-06-01,WOS:000269193000006,,

Still, conclusive evidence of their functioning is lacking, amongst others due to the influence of spatio-temporal variations in fish populations and habitat heterogeneity which could hamper a sound data interpretation. We conducted a spatial analysis of the benefits of the Medes Island Marine Reserve by combining geostatistical and Geographic Information System (GIS) tools. Concurrently, we analysed effects of trends reflecting habitat heterogeneity and spatial structuring of data on spatial predictions of fish catch per unit effort (CPUE) and length. Predicted spatial patterns showed the complexity and simultaneous action of trend factors leading to mostly non-linear gradients in CPUE and length data. CPUE of total fish and CPUE and length of common pandora (Pagellus erythrinus) increased close to the Integral Reserve due to direct and indirect reserve effects. CPUE and length of striped red mullet (Mullus surmuletus) slightly increased also near the Integral Reserve, but distinct reserve effects could not be identified due to the strong influence of artificial reefs. We conclude that the spatial dimension of the Buffer Zone, where artisanal fisheries are allowed, permits in general protection only for target species, favouring a habitat with no discontinuities from the reserve outwards. Our spatial approach to assess reserve benefits provides major insights into complex systems like coastal marine reserves in the northwestern Mediterranean. In addition, it contributes to a crucial aspect of marine conservation, viz. the decision on the spatial dimension of protected areas. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Such comparisons are very important as LBF depth distributions are strongly influenced by light penetration in the water column and sea floor substrate. Brunei waters are generally rich in suspended material due to the large rivers discharging in the Brunei Bay, and the sea floor is mostly covered by fine mud where LBF have never been reported.

All samples were on sediment habitats, but some were in close proximity to volcanic seamounts and outcropping rocky seabed in submarine canyons. The great majority of species were previously recorded from Australian waters (90%), and the GAB (75%). A markedly lower proportion of recorded species occurred at greater depths (1700-3000 m) where there had been virtually no previous sampling: 74% in Australian waters, and 30% in GAB waters. The fauna is dominated by families that typify many areas of the global deep sea: rattails (Macrouridae), cut-throat eels (Synaphobranchidae), morid cods (Moridae), oreo dories (Oreosomatidae), slickheads (Alepocephalidae), cusk-eels (Ophidiidae) and halosaurs (Halosauridae). The Macrouridae was most diverse, occurred most frequently, was most abundant (density) in 400 m and all deeper strata, and top ranked by biomass and density in standardised data. The predominant patterns of biogeographical affinities were strongly influenced by depth. Endemic species were most prevalent in shelf break and upper to mid-slope depths (both 52%), and declined with increasing depth (upper to mid-slope species 25%; lower slope/rise 4%), consistent with a general pattern in the Australian ichthyofauna. Fish biomass (gm(-2)) was significantly related to depth, being relatively very low (similar to 0.5 gm(-2)) at 200 m depth, highest at 400 m (similar to 3.4 gm(-2)), then steadily declining with increasing depth to about 0.4 gm(-2) at 3000 m depth. Depth was the main factor explaining assemblage structure. There was no clear distinction of assemblages at sites close to structured habitats, and no longitudinal pattern across a gradient of productivity (higher in the east due to summertime upwelling). The GAB is presently being considered for oil and gas exploration in areas extending from the shelf break (200 m) to beyond 4000 m depths. The current data set has the potential to inform biodiversity management in the GAB, including the design of an ecological monitoring program prior to oil and gas exploration, because it includes samples from within and immediately adjacent to the Great Australian Bight Australian Marine Park (GAB AMP) and six active lease blocks.

Samples were taken in three different types of habitat, an artificial reef (AR) site, a natural reef (NR) site, and sandy-mud bottom (SE) site, from May 1987 to September 1998, mostly every two months. A total of 67 prey items were recognized in the stomachs of 45 predator fish species. The most important preys were the pelagic fishes Sardinops melanostictus and Engraulis japonicus, which comprised 37% wet wt of the overall stomach contents. The percentage of pelagic fishes was highest at AR site, where fish density was highest. The dominant ten species could be divided into five feeding types. The pelagic fish feeders Physiculus maximowiczi and Gadus macrocephalus fed mainly on S. melanostictus. The dietary breadth of P. maximowiczi was wide, while that of Gadus macrocephalus was narrow. The pelagic crustacean feeder Theragra chalcogramma mostly consumed Themisto japonica and euphausiids and showed the least dietary overlap with other fishes. Benthic fish feeders were Hemitripterus villosus and Liparis tanakai. The benthic crustacean feeders Alcichthys alcicornis and Hexagrammos otakii consumed benthic crustaceans as well as pelagic and benthic fishes and showed the largest dietary breadth. The benthic invertebrate feeders Gymnocanthus intermedius. Dexistes rikuzenius and Tanakius kitaharai fed mainly on polychaetes and benthic crustaceans. But Gymnocanthus intermedius consumed a significant proportion of pelagic fishes. Ontogenetic dietary shift was recognized for these fishes. Pelagic fishes were consumed more intensively by larger individuals, especially true of A. alcicornis, Theragra chalcogramma and Gadus macrocephalus. Predominancy of the two most abundant species, P. maximowiczi and A. alcicornis, may be supported by their wide dietary breadth and the significant proportion of pelagic fish in their diets.

This convergence of high speed computing and optics has resulted in the creation of full spherical cameras and their application in marine environments has begun. Thus, there is a need to understand how large increases in camera field-of-view (FOV) impacts data collection and statistical inference, particularly when dealing with long-term time-series data. Data collected in this survey consisted of a single year of sampling and were insufficient to describe relationships for single species, therefore we species were grouped based on lineage and behavior into snappers, jacks, and mixed-reef groups. The empirical and theoretical models presented here demonstrate an asymptotic relationship between single-camera MaxN and four-camera MaxN counts for snappers and to a lesser extent the mixed reef groups composed primarily of groupers. In contrast the jack group showed a linear relationship between counts. This result suggests that accuracy of the counts can be improved by increasing camera field-of-view to 360 or full-spherical. Habitat complexity was demonstrated to be positively related to fish counts but had no effect on the relationship between camera FOV and fish counts. This could be the result of several things, 1) fish behavior is more critical in driving aggregative behaviors that modify the relationship between FOV and fish counts, 2) abundances observed in this region are not high enough for habitat effects to have impacted the relationship, or 3) a mixture of these effects. Further exploration of these relationships is needed that would improve sample sizes, more observation:, at high counts, and that establish species specific relationships. This work provides empirical footing to further develop the relationship between MaxN-type estimators relative to camera FOV and additionally includes insight into the effects of habitat. Critically, this work provides a method to relate counts produced from 360 systems to those produced with restricted FOV.",,,,,,,,,15,0,0,0,12,0,17,,,0022-0981,1879-1697,,,,,,,,,,"Southeast Fisheries Sci Ctr, Natl Marine Fisheries Serv, Mississippi Labs, 3209 Frederic St, Pascagoula, MS 39567 USARiverside Technol Inc, Natl Marine Fisheries Serv, Southeast Fisheries Sci Ctr, Mississippi Labs, Pascagoula, MS 39567 USAFlorida Int Univ, Biol Sci Dept, 3000 NE 151st St, North Miami, FL 33181 USA",,,,2018-04-02,WOS:000427664700005,,

Fifteen coral patches were chosen and underwater visual surveys were conducted during a 2-year period. The larval settlement of the species mainly occurred between May and October during the 2-year survey period. In terms of lunar periodicity of the settlement, the newly settled juveniles were mainly found between the last quarter moon and new moon during the main settlement season. Back calculations of settlement dates based on otolith microstructure showed that most juveniles settled during the last quarter moon and new moon. Stepwise multiple regression analyses revealed that the newly settled juveniles were mainly found on coral patches with a large number of holes on the top of the coral patch and this tendency was mainly consistent during the study period. The volume of holes at the base of coral patches had also a positive effect on the abundance of newly settled juveniles in some cases.

Recreational boating is a very important component of the diverse maritime traffic in the southeastern United States. The seasonal distribution of offshore recreational vessels in waters off the coast of Northeast Florida and Southeast Georgia was modeled using several techniques (Poisson, negative binomial, hurdle and zero inflated modes, generalized additive models, and generalized mixed models) and by combining map-based information provided by recreational boaters with environmental and geographical variables to find the most parsimonious model. Based on model performance, the final model analysis was conducted using a GAM approach with a negative binomial distribution. The best seasonal models explained between 86.1%-88.6% of the total deviance.

We estimated the spatial scale of movement, activity patterns, and individual home ranges, as well as whether these variables were affected by lionfish size or density. Lionfish were tracked up to 89 days and had 95% kernel utilization distribution (KUD) home ranges between 158 and 4051 m2.

Movement pattern and velocity data revealed two (10%) tagged lionfish were consumed by fast-moving predators, while another two emigrated outside the array. Acoustic detection of the remaining tagged fish ended prematurely following two hurricanes that passed over the array, which may implicate the storms in displacing tagged fish, causing tag loss, or contributing to lionfish mortality.

Reef materials were compared at the deep site ( gtoreq 15 m) by quantifying stability, durability, target fish attraction, and cost per unit surface area. Assessment at the shallow site ( lt 15 m) included only stability, durability, and cost per unit surface area. Cubes and domes were stable in shallow ( lt 15 m) waters. Pipes and domes were stable and cubes were unstable in deep waters ( gtoreq 15 m). Pipes were evaluated only at the deep site. The only structural damage observed was to two domes which were crushed during deployment. Acceptable postdeployment durability was observed for all three materials through 2 years of monitoring. Relative abundance and species richness for target fishes were assessed at the deep site and were similar for the three materials tested. Over a 2-year period, target fishes were visually censused 125 times on the three materials, and 13 target species or groups of target fishes were observed. The only significant difference in relative abundance between materials was for gag Mycteroperca microlepis at pipes versus domes (P = 0.0001) and at pipes versus cubes (P = 0.0087). A significant decline in relative abundance of black sea bass Centropristis striata between years at pipes (P = 0.023) probably resulted from high fishing mortality.

These prices included delivery to Morehead City, North Carolina, and all assembly and deployment costs.

Experiments were performed to determine the impacts of crude oil, dispersed crude oil, and dispersant on the community structure and function of microorganisms in seawater (SW) and biofilms formed on carbon steel, a common ship hull construction material. Steel corrosion was also monitored to illustrate how oil spills may impact preservation of steel shipwrecks. Microcosms were filled with seawater (SW) and incubated at 4°C. Carbon steel disks (CSDs) were placed in each tank, and tanks were amended with crude oil and/or dispersant or no treatment. SW and CSD biofilms were sampled biweekly for genetic analysis using Illumina sequencing of 16S ribosomal RNA gene amplicons. Predicted and sequenced bacterial metagenomes were analyzed to examine impacts of oil and dispersant on metabolic function. Gammaproteobacteria, Alphaproteobacteria, and Flavobacteriia dominated SW and biofilms. Bacterial community structure differed significantly between treatments for SW and biofilms. OTUs affiliated with known (Pseudomonas) and potential (Marinomonas) hydrocarbon-degraders were roughly twice as abundant in biofilms treated with oil and dispersed oil, and steel corrosion of CSDs in these treatments was higher compared to control and dispersant treatments. OTUs affiliated with the Rhodobacteraceae family (biofilm formers and potential oil degraders) were less abundant in the dispersant treatment compared to other treatments in biofilm and SW samples, but OTUs affiliated with the Pseudoalteromonas genus (biofilm formers and proposed hydrocarbon degraders) were more abundant in dispersant-treated biofilms. Overall, functional gene analyses revealed a decrease in genes (predicted using PICRUSt and observed in sequenced metagenomes) associated with hydrocarbon degradation in dispersant-treated biofilms. This study indicates that exposure to oil and dispersant could disrupt the composition and metabolic function of biofilms colonizing metal hulls, as well as corrosion processes, potentially compromising shipwrecks as ecological and historical resources.

They are mainly built with concrete materials, however, their leachates have considerable impacts on algae. Therefore to increase the algal colonization five chemoattractants such as ferrous sulfate, zinc oxide, ammonium nitrate, sodium phosphate and ferrous lactate were screened against spores of a fouling alga, Ulva pertusa.

Consequently, successful settlement is likely to be determined by an interaction between larval delivery and behavior, habitat availability, and structural characteristics (e.g., configuration) of the habitat itself. We examined the effects of habitat configuration and availability on the settlement of New Zealand triplefins (Tripterygiidae), using a field experiment that comprised three habitat treatments and evaluated effects over naturally varying levels of larval supply. Our results suggest that settler density and total settlement are shaped by both the availability and spatial configuration of habitat patches. Highest total settlement occurred in larger, more clumped habitat patches. Lowest total settlement occurred in more dispersed habitat patches of the same size and smaller isolated patches. The densities of recently settled triplefins were lowest in the dispersed patches, and high in both isolated patches and the clumped patches. We speculate that dispersed patches may comprise a lower quality habitat, and/or provide a weaker settlement trigger for both physical and biological reasons. Clumped patches, on the other hand, may provide a stronger settlement cue via baffling of currents, or may represent a higher quality habitat for recently settled triplefins, triggering higher settlement Our findings indicate that habitat availability can influence abundance of recently settled fish, but the landscape architecture is an equally important determinant of settlement success for triplefins.

Although existing leases require complete removal of all platforms and associated infrastructure, the underlying laws and regulations have changed in recent years to allow a number of alternative uses after decommissioning. In particular, AB 2503, signed into law in September 2010, provides for a rigs-to-reefs program that allows the state to accept ownership of decommissioned platforms in federal waters. Decisions about whether to remove platforms completely or leave them in place as artificial reefs will depend in part on the relative cost of the 2 options. In this study, we describe the design and use of a mathematical decision model that provides detailed cost estimates of complete and partial removal (to 85 feet below the water line) for California's offshore platforms. The model, PLATFORM, is loaded with Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement (BSEE) and Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) costs for complete removal, along with costs for partial removal calculated for this study and estimates of the uncertainty associated with decommissioning cost estimates. PLATFORM allows users to define a wide range of decommissioning and costing scenarios (e.g., number of platforms, choice of heavy lift vessel, shell mound removal, reef enhancement). As a benchmark cost, complete removal of all 27 offshore platforms, grouped into the 7 decommissioning projects defined by the most recent federal cost estimates produced in 2010, would cost an estimated $1.09 billion, whereas partial removal of these platforms, grouped into the same set of projects, would cost $478 million, with avoided costs of $616 million (with minor rounding).

The Belgian North Sea is being used for a lot of different purposes, such as fishing, aggregate extraction, wind farms, dredging, etc. Due to these increasing economic activities, the underwater archive is in danger. In the context of the UNESCO Convention on the Protection of the Underwater Cultural Heritage of 2001, gathering more information about the submerged cultural heritage in the intertidal zones of the North Sea is one of the main objectives of the Belgian scientific project 'SeArch'. It will give a clearer picture of the broader cultural and archaeological heritage in the region and it can be used as a basis for a sustainable management by government agencies. The Department of Geography (Ghent University, Belgium) contributes to the SeArch project in two ways. First, an innovative survey methodology has been developed which allows an accurate and cost-efficient evaluation of the archaeological potential in the intertidal zones of the Belgian beaches. Secondly, the Department of Geography is developing an interactive webGlS platform, which makes it possible to share, integrate and visualize the gathered archaeological and environmental data and information in a user-friendly way. Hereby, the total potential of this project is fully exploited in a time-efficient manner. To create an interactive webGlS platform, a good structured spatial database is needed. It enables manipulation of a wide variety of georeferenced information in both raster and vector formats. This paper provides more information about the configuration and application of the spatial database. Moreover, it focusses on the development of a fully functional Spatial Data Infrastructure (SDI) using the most reliable, powerful and state-of-the-art technological components. Besides, a new way of collecting geomatic data in a fast and accurate manner will be discussed.

The greatest benthic modifications occurred within the footprint of the foundation structures through the development of mussel aggregations. Within four years, changes in benthic habitats (defined as biotopes) were observed within the 90 m range of the study, clearly linked to the mussel-dominated colonization of the structures, which also hosted numerous indigenous fish species.

Slower maturation rates ( among fish <= 6 years old), lower GSI values and decreased spawning frequency were observed, and were especially pronounced in the northwestern Gulf. Furthermore, an Index of Reproductive Importance showed that young fish (ages 2-7) are contributing far less to the spawning stock in recent years, while older fish (> 8 years) are contributing more, when compared to fish from the same age groups sampled in the previous decade. Coincident with these changes in reproductive output, fishing pressure has steadily declined gulf-wide, and spawning stock biomass and spawning potential ratio have increased. Thus, it is possible that the age structure of the red snapper stock is becoming less truncated, or that reproductive effort observed is due to the temporary influence of recent strong year classes produced in 2004 and 2006 as they begin to reach full reproductive potential. If the latter is true, careful documentation of the stock's reproductive dynamics during a time of population growth provides new understanding at the meta-population spatial and decadal temporal scales. In contrast, if the former is true, a truncated age structure due to overharvest can limit the productivity of the Gulf red snapper stock. In addition, we have learned that red snapper females in the northwestern Gulf collected on natural reefs and banks have much higher reproductive output than those on artificial reefs in the form of standing and toppled oil and gas platforms, thus making the need to know the relative abundance of females found on these disparate habitats an important next step toward better-understanding factors impacting the reproductive dynamics of this species.",,,,,,,,,22,1,0,0,21,0,25,,,1932-6203,,,,,,,,,,,"Louisiana State Univ, Dept Oceanog & Coastal Sci, Baton Rouge, LA 70803 USAUniv S Alabama, Dept Marine Sci, Mobile, AL 36688 USATexas A&M Corpus Christi, Dept Life Sci, Corpus Christi, TX 78412 USA",,,,2017-03-29,WOS:000399174600003,28355239,

Results of quarterly trawl sampling conducted from spring 2004 through spring 2005 revealed that inshore lizardfish are most abundant on sand habitat, but larger fish are more common on shell rubble habitat. There was no significant difference in fish density between habitats exposed to shrimp trawling on the open shelf versus those habitats within a permitted artificial reef zone that served as a de facto no-trawl area; this finding indicates that either inshore lizardfish experienced minimal effects from trawling or, more likely, that fish moved between trawled and non-trawled habitats. Exploitation ratio (bycatch mortality/total morality) estimates derived from catch curve analysis ranged from 0.43 inside the artificial reef zone to 0.55 outside the reef zone, thus indicating that inshore lizardfish are subject to significant fishing mortality in the north central Gulf of Mexico despite the lack of a directed fishery for the species.

The season and length of submersion had a strong influence on the total biomass and on community structure while the type of substratum had very little impact on the total biomass or the structure of the epibiotic community. The season of submersion determined the species composition of the newly submerged surfaces. In the spring and summer, tubeworms were the most abundant. In the autumn and winter, barnacles and tunicates dominated. Community succession was not obvious in the first year of submersion as it was intermingled with strong seasonal settlement, growth and death of barnacles and tunicates. In the second year of submersion, green mussels and tunicates settled and grew to occupy most of the panel surfaces, forming an assemblage that was characteristic of climax communities in the local subtidal waters. The results suggest that the type of construction material has limited impact on the development of epibiotic communities on artificial reefs deployed in Hong Kong; the season of submersion may affect community structure in the early successional stage, but not the characteristics of the climax communities.

Reducing GHG emissions by changing the energy production mix is one option to reach targets being set by international communities. As the implementation of renewable and non-renewable energy infrastructure deployed in marine ecosystems increases, it is not clear how these changes will impact on the marine environment and the ecosystem services it provides. To address this knowledge gap a systematic mapping approach was applied, with three key aims: firstly, to provide an overview of the types of impacts being studied for the offshore components of nuclear, offshore oil & gas and offshore wind arrays; secondly to demonstrate how these impacts can be translated into ecosystem services; and finally to provide a searchable database of the results.Methods: Searches for relevant articles were carried out using academic and grey literature databases. A total of 2297 articles were sourced, which were screened using selection criteria that determined which subject populations, exposure types and outcomes were considered relevant. To translate these findings into ecosystem service impacts, the Common International Classification of Ecosystem Services (CICES) and Millennium Ecosystem Assessment frameworks were used to ensure relevance, transparency and replicability.Results: A total of 50 articles, which equated to 208 studies, spanning four decades since 1970, were selected and coded for the systematic map. Across all energy systems, benthic species were the most studied group. Following this, results then varied by group; marine birds and fish were most prevalent in studies of offshore wind; fish for offshore oil & gas studies; and pelagic organisms for nuclear. The outcome variables most investigated were changes in population and ecosystem function/process. Of all the ecosystem services associated with the studied impacts, regulating services were investigated most often, due to the large number of studies on benthic organisms. Cultural services, specific to offshore wind, were also prevalent.Discussion: The systematic map provides a searchable database of articles and their relevant studies on the local ecological impacts of marine renewable energies.

This technique is becoming one of the most effective, cheapest and most friendly options for developing countries.Integrated solution for reducing the erosion problems along Alexandria coastline is presented. The study was applied at Sidi-Bisher Beach, east of Alexandria city, Egypt with narrow beach width.To solve the erosion problems, submerged Artificial Reefs (SARs) are suggested to induce wave breaking and energy dissipation. A numerical model MIKE 21 CAMS of DHI Water & Environment Morphological Modelling System is applied to investigate the shoreline development behind a single shore-parallel-submerged breakwater. The numerical model MIKE 21 was validated using other numerical models and experimental data. Comparative analysis study between the conventional submerged breakwater and the geo-containers sand filling submerged reef proposed is presented and discussed.",,,,,12th International Conference on the Mediterranean Coastal Environment (MEDCOAST)12th International Conference on the Mediterranean Coastal Environment (MEDCOAST),"OCT 06-10, 2015OCT 06-10, 2015","Mediterranean Coastal Fdn; Inst Oceanol; Inst Fish Resources; Republ Turkey, Promot FundMediterranean Coastal Fdn; Inst Oceanol; Inst Fish Resources; Republ Turkey, Promot Fund","Varna, BULGARIAVarna, BULGARIA",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,978-605-85652-3-4,,,,,,,,,"Arab Acad Sci & Technol & Maritime Transport, Coll Engn & Technol, PO 1029, Alexandria, EgyptUniv Alexandria, Fac Engn, Alexandria, Egypt",,,,2016-07-06,WOS:000377577200068,,
J,,,,,,,,,Robert Miller,,Increasing the Life of Marine Turbines by Design and Innovation,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Awarded Grant,Apr 30 2012,2012,"Unsteady loads on tidal turbines are much larger than in wind turbines because of the high density of water and the high levels of unsteadiness in offshore marine environments. In addition the welded mild steel structures normally used to support marine turbines have a low fatigue life in salt water. This can lead to life of 30 months or less instead of the design requirement of 30 years. In addition fatigue life limits the number of locations where tidal turbine can be deployed, limiting the overall practical UK tidal resource. This project aims to develop innovative technologies which will reduce the unsteady loads which result from flow unsteadiness and thus increase the longevity of a marine turbine by an order of magnitude.Two technologies will be developed. The first uses innovative hydraulic drive trains, developed in the UK, to reduce the unsteady loads created by large length unsteady 'gusts', those larger in size than the machine diameter. The hydraulic drive train allows the speed of the turbine to respond quickly to the 'gust' ensuring that the load on the machine remains constant. The second innovative technology is designed to reduce the unsteady loads created by short length unsteady 'gusts', those smaller than the machine diameter. The technology is similar to that used in aircraft to stop sudden changes in aircraft lift as the wing is hit by an air 'gust'. The technology uses 'spoilers', 'fluid ejection' or 'flaps' on the wing to automatically hold the blade lift constant as the 'gust' moves over it. This technology will be employed on tidal turbine blades to reduce unsteady loading due to short length scale unsteady 'gusts'. Once developed this second technology could also be used as an alternative to variable pitch mechanisms to avoid peak loads being exceeded.The project approach will be to use experimental testing and computational modelling developed in the jet engine industry to understand how the unsteadiness in marine environment resulted in unsteady turbine loading. A simplified model describing the turbine response to unsteady flow will then be implemented in the tidal turbine design code of a number of UK tidal turbine companies. This will improve the UK tidal turbine industries capability to predict the effect of flow unsteadiness.Experiments and computation will be used to develop the new automated 'spoiler' and 'flap' control system for gust loading control. This control system in conjunction with a model for the innovative hydraulic drive train will be implemented in the tidal turbine design codes. This will allow the success of the unsteady load reduction systems to be modelled.Current published measurements of sea turbulence are limited in both their spatial and temporal resolution. It is important to this study that improved measurements are obtained. The project members will work in collaboration with the tidal turbines companies partnered in this project, and with the Supergen partners, to improve the resolution of the available measurements. A new method of using conventional acoustic doppler equipment has been developed and if necessary this will be used in the project to achieve improved measurement resolution.Finally the unsteady load reduction systems and the hydraulic drive train will be incorporated into a scale model of the tidal turbine and this will be tested in a water flume. The tests will be undertaken with flow unsteadiness characteristic of the marine environment. These tests will determine the project's success in achieving an unsteady load reduction.Successful application of the load reduction systems to full scale tidal turbines will provide benefits in terms of extended maintenance periods and increased service life. Furthermore as turbines become less sensitive to their environmental operating conditions a larger number of tidal sites will become available as viable for producing power thereby increasing the UK tidal resource.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,EP/J010308/1,,,,,,,,University of Cambridge,,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:15368829,,

Three volume coefficients (k(1), k(2), and k(3)) were proposed for estimation of the total loss, effective usable volume, and burial volume of ARs, based on the recorded facility standard volume and seabed condition at the time of construction. Five parameters were redefined to clarify their use; two measures and three statistically obtainable coefficients were proposed from geometric hypotheses. Field data obtained from coastal waters near Busan in South Korea were used to demonstrate the estimation and prediction of these parameters. We determined that the burial volume of an AR can be predicted with less than 20% error using the mean values of k(1) =1.33, k(2) = 1.36, and k(3) = 1.37 for a rigid seabed and k(1) = 1.32, k(2) = 1.72, and k(3) = 1.83 for a soft seabed. The effective usable volume can be predicted with less than 11% error using the mean values, seabed condition, and facility standard volume determined at the design stage. We found that it is unnecessary to use multi-beam echo, side scan sonar, and divers' investigation for prediction; hence, a cost-effective method was developed for the future management of AIRs.

We identified 26 papers and technical reports that surveyed sediment samples from 72 production or exploration platform sites to assess the zone of influence of sediment contamination and biological effects on benthic communities. While oil-based fluids are now rarely used in the marine context, their release has had large-scale (out to 6 km) and persistent (decadal time scale) impacts on benthic communities. The zone of influence of water-based drilling fluids as determined by sediment barium concentration was larger (2 to 20 km) than for synthetic-based fluids (200 to 2000 m). The zone of biological effects on benthic community diversity and abundance ranged from 100 to 1000 m for both water and synthetic fluids. Effects include changes in benthic species diversity, abundance and alterations to community structure. Functional changes included a loss of suspension-feeding species and increases in deposit feeders and polychaetes. In general, this review demonstrates a loss of benthic biodiversity and suspension-feeding communities due to oil exploration and production and the potential for large-scale effects on sensitive communities such as deep-sea, coral and vegetated habitats.

Ten fish were put in the tank at a time. They gathered to form a single school and swimmed about keeping the school. The experimental fishes were inspected 100 times within 1 min. intervals. At each inspection the division just visited was recorded. Effectiveness of the model reefs to attract stone bream was evaluated by the frequency with which the school visited the division where the models were placed. The results are: (1) Smaller models (15xl5xl5cm) attracted smaller fishes (140 mm total length), but could not attract the larger fishes (210 mm. total length). (2) Larger models (6060x45 cm) attracted the larger fishes as well as the smaller ones. (3) Stone bream showed a marked preference for the model reef put in the centre of the tank to the shadow of the walls of the tank which was thrown by the direct sun's ray near the periphery.

There has been an increased number of restoration projects assessing ecosystem-scale processes, such as nutrient cycling and productivity. However, an examination of trophic interactions (e.g., trophic position, linkages, and diversity) as a tool for assessing restoration success is limited and can provide a more complete depiction of restoration success when coupled with traditional community metrics. Here, the impact of habitat restoration on trophic recovery was assessed through a targeted literature review, analyzing how trophic structure responds to habitat restoration over time, compared to control sites, and viewed across ecosystems. Overall, trophic structure recovers following restoration but may require several years. Comparing systems, restoration of trophic structure in terrestrial environments has received less attention (19%) as compared to freshwater (31%) and coastal (50%) systems. Community metrics and stable isotopes were the most common methods for assessing trophic interactions and will likely continue to be valuable tools when assessing how restoration impacts ecosystems. In terms of best practices to achieve and quantify trophic restoration success, future studies should increase frequency and duration of pre- and post-restoration monitoring, establish consistency in selecting control sites, and incorporate habitat structural elements compatible with restoration to attract higher trophic level species. The inclusion of trophic interactions in restoration projects generates a more comprehensive understanding of trophic structure and ecosystem function and offers insights to develop more effective management strategies for achieving long-term restoration success.

The wreck lies in an upward position in a right angle to the dominating bottom current, which is potentially affecting seabed topography, sediment characteristics and zoobenthic communities both upstream (NE) and downstream (SW) of the wreck. This multidisciplinary study attempts to clarify abiotic and biotic patterns and processes in the vicinity of the wreck by combining field investigations with physical simulation studies in the field and in the laboratory. Multibeam echo-sounder techniques were utilised to generate a map of the wreck area and sediment grab samples were taken to characterize the sediment type and its zoobenthic community. A medium-sized field experiment generated data on the accumulation of sediment organic matter in the presence and absence of a current and/or a barrier on the seafloor and a small-scaled laboratory study was conducted to simulate scour forming processes.The results showed that a deeper basin, scour area, with the dimensions 150 x 300 m, was present downstream of the wreck and there was also a smaller scour area upstream of the wreck. Similar traces on the bottom were simulated in the laboratory. The organic content (recent mud) and the proportion of finer sediment were more pronounced in areas closer to both sides of the wreck. These results were in turn imitated in a field experiment, where the accumulation of organic matter in the sediment increased significantly downstream, when a current was interrupted by a barrier. Regarding zoobenthos in the wreck area, 11 taxa and a mean total abundance of 773 individuals per m(2) were registered. The dominant species were Macoma balthica and Marenzelleria sp., which together made up >80% of the total number of individuals. Multivariate data analyses showed significant differences in community structure between upstream and downstream sides of the wreck and these differences were basically expressed as more individuals upstream of the wreck of the seven most common species. Univariate data analyses also showed significantly more species and higher total abundance in the scour area upstream of the wreck compared to the downstream scour area. The weakened communities downstream of the wreck were possibly due to accumulation of organic matter and more frequent occurrence of hypoxia. The results are useful for describing bottom areas around long-term physical barriers/artificial reefs, as background measurements ahead of possibly increased archaeological diving activities, sediment excavations or measures taken to raise the wreck to the surface, as well as for any attempts to preserve the wreck in situ.

Imaging is also being complemented by in situ environmental-DNA sequencing technologies, allowing the traceability of a wide range of organisms (including prokaryotes) beyond the reach of optoacoustic tools.

It has been postulated that because of their size, many houseboats are similar to permanent structures in that they shade a significant portion of the benthos and thereby limit production by benthic flora. On the other hand, these structures can benefit biotic communities by providing sites for attachment of organisms in a substrate-limited environment and both habitat and food sources for fish. In this study, we examined whether houseboats benefit or harm the ecological integrity of a typical seagrass dominated system, at La Parguera, Puerto Rico. We performed a benthic survey to compare the diversity and health of seagrasses under houseboats to that at control locations. Species diversity (0-0.79) varied significantly among sites, but this variability was not attributed to the houseboats. Rather, the variability appeared related to the proximity of the study locations to new development along the shoreline. Average seagrass blade density and length were 52.7 blades/m(-2) and 23.6 cm, respectively. Neither parameter differed between houseboat and control areas; however, both varied significantly among sites. In addition, boat hulls were heavily encrusted with invertebrates. The overall averages of species diversity and richness of sessile organisms on hulls of the houseboats were 1.13 and 4.83, respectively. Fish also utilized these structures.

This study considered habitat impacts associated with five important marine sectors; bottom fishing, marine aggregate dredging, sediment disposal, renewable energy devices (tidal, waves, and wind) and the oil and gas sectors, both individually and cumulatively. The significance of the actual footprint of impact arising from these human activities and their associated pressures (sediment abrasion, sediment removal, smothering, and placement of hard structures) is presented and discussed. Notable differences in sensitivity to activities are seen depending on habitat type. Some of the more substantial changes in benthic habitat function evaluated are potentially associated with the placement of hard structures in shallow mobile sedimentary habitats, which result in a shift in habitat dominated by small, short-living infaunal species, to a habitat dominated by larger, longer-lived, sessile epibenthic suspension feeders. In contrast, the impacts of bottom fishing, dredging and disposal activities are all assessed to be most severe when executed in deep, sedimentary habitats. Such assessments are important in supporting policies (e. g. spatial planning) directed towards ensuring sustainable  blue-growth, through a better understanding of the potential ecological impacts associated with human activities operating across different habitat types. The aim of this study is to provide a better understanding of the spatial extent of selected human activities and their impacts on seabed habitats using a biological trait-based sensitivity analysis.",,,,,,,,,42,3,0,0,34,0,45,,,1054-3139,1095-9289,,,,,,,,,,"Cefas, Pakefield Rd, Lowestoft NR33 0HT, Suffolk, England",,,,2018-12-28,WOS:000434070900018,,

However, the effects of this reef on the surrounding macrobenthic communities were unknown. We compared sedimentary factors, macrobenthic biomass, abundance, and community composition and ecological indicators between the reef and non-reef areas over a one year period. The mean values for chlorophyll a (Chl a), total organic matter (TOM), total organic carbon (TOC), and total nitrogen (TN) content in surface sediments in the reef area were slightly higher than those in the non-reef area. The Chl a levels differed significantly between the two areas, but the TOM, TOC, and TN were not significantly different. The abundance of crustaceans was significantly different between the two areas, but the abundance and biomass of polychaetes, echinoderms, mollusk did not differ significantly. The permutational multivariate analysis of variance (PERMANOVA) revealed that the macrobenthic community differed significantly through time and analysis of similarity multivariate analyses (ANOSIM) revealed that the macrobenthic community differed significantly in some months. The ecological indicators revealed that the environmental quality of the reef area was slightly better than that of the non-reef area.

J,,,,,,,,,Simon Arthur Read,,"Imagining the measure of change: art, science and the estuary community",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Awarded Grant,Jan 01 2020,2020,"The intention of this network proposal is for an artist, Simon Read and coastal scientist, Helene Burningham to collaborate with a community partnership, the Deben Estuary Partnership (DEP) on the consultation exercise leading to an estuary management plan. The context for this is the need to reach beyond opinion to a resolution that fuses interpretation of available data, stakeholder need and the passionate connection that a community has to its landscape.Historically, where an estuary strategy is government agency led, the parameters are already constrained by established determinants such as Flood Risk Management and the obligation to conserve intertidal habitat. Where in the past it has been found at public consultation stage that this can lead to discord, the DEP has sought to harmonise the process by adopting a more integrated approach to link stakeholder interest to a more informed understanding of estuary systems and how they are likely to change in the futureIn 2015, the DEP published an estuary plan that was both endorsed by the Environment Agency and adopted by the local planning authority. Now however, due to a change in local government there is a need to review and revise this document to align with a new Local Plan. It is coincidental that many of the actions proposed in the existing management plan have come to pass, including extensive improvement to the capability of the flood defences and an enhanced appreciation of the value of saltmarsh.In the interim so much has changed: climate change continues to drive sea level rise, putting pressure upon intertidal habitat, sustainability of flood defences and causing saline intrusion into the groundwater. Pressure for housing will cause an increase in visitor numbers and footfall, increasing levels of disturbance around the estuary, as will the agreement over the route for the Coastal Path. Disturbance has also been caused in the estuary landscape by the installation of infrastructure for the Anglia 1 offshore wind turbine array. Given these pressures and the Deben may become the victim of its own popularity both afloat and ashore, it is not an option to just update the existing management plan. This has led the DEP to decide to focus upon the nature of change, what evidence there may be in the estuary, what a future scenario may look like and what strategies should be put in place to adapt and to manage it.Since many changes in landscape are so incremental that communities may not be aware of their significance, it will be a challenge to develop a format for a discussion about how to build a management plan around the certainties and uncertainties to be faced in future. Since the conditions that both affect and respond to change are profoundly cultural as much as factual, it makes sense that an arts and science team might collaborate with the DEP to devise a programme of workshops for community members to accumulate and negotiate evidence for the estuary plan.The proposal is to generate six workshop events through 2000-2001 to explore themes relating to understanding change in the context of the Deben Estuary and to make this a material discourse requiring participants to contribute to the accumulation of evidence during the project. The final workshop will be a feedback session to reflect on what has been learned, followed at the end of 2021 by an exhibition of the material produced at a suitable location in the estuary to which all participants, institutional and community stakeholders will be invited and will subsequently be open to the wider public.Our aspiration is that working in partnership with the DEP, a reflexive and reflective arts/science activity will enhance a sense of understanding of estuary systems, foster a more informed level of debate and have the potential to contribute materially to the Deben Estuary Plan.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,AH/T006161/1,,,,,,,,Middlesex University,,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:15379399,,

This region exhibits a classical pelagic benthic dichotomy of food-web structure in ecological function. The Klondike study area borders the eastern edge of the Central Channel and functions as a pelagic-dominated ecosystem, whereas the Burger study area lies south of Hanna Shoal and functions as a benthic-dominated ecosystem. The Statoil study area, which is located north of Klondike and northwest of Burger, has both pelagic and benthic attributes, although it is more like Burger than like Klondike. Klondike has lower benthic density and biomass, a higher biomass of oceanic zooplankton, and more fishes and planktivorous seabirds than does Burger, which has benthic communities with high density and biomass, primarily neritic zooplankton, and higher densities of benthic-feeding marine mammals than Klondike; Statoil has characteristics of both ecosystems. Patterns of sea-ice retreat vary interannually; in some years, much of the northeastern Chukchi is ice-free by mid-May, leading to pelagic and ice-edge phytoplankton blooms, whereas heavy ice cover in other years leads to substantial within-ice production. The characteristics of this region during the open-water season are not consistent among years, in that Bering Sea Water impinges onto all study areas only in some years, resulting in interannual variation in the distribution and abundance of zooplankton, planktivorous seabirds, and pelagic-feeding seals. These interannual variations alter several aspects of this pelagic benthic dichotomy, and some aspects of this region suggest unusual structure (e.g., replacement of benthic-feeding fishes in some areas by predatory invertebrates, a lack of benthic-feeding seaducks).

According to incomplete statistics, in 2007, there are about 159 wind-powered farms that are under construction. The installed wind-powered generator set achieved 4871 kilowatts; the total engine capacity is 10.3451 million kilowatts. The development situation of the wind power industry is good, and the prospects for further development are extremely broad. The wind farms in China will achieve 321 sets by 2010, the installed wind-powered generator set will reach 8436 kilowatts, and the total engine capacity will be 51.1553 million kilowatts; by 2020, the total engine capacity will, hopefully, reach 100 million kilowatts, which is approximately 3% of China's estimated power generation.China, at present, is in the heavy chemical industry stage of the industrialization intermediate stage; the electricity demand gap is big; high energy-consuming industries account for a high proportion of energy use;. and the energy is short, the environment pollution is serious, the national energy saving and pollution discharge reducing duty is heavy, so China must develop its wind power industry. However, there are problems in the development of China's wind power industry as follows: (I)the strategic position of the wind power industry is low; (2) the exploitation and utilization level of wind energy resources is lows (3) the development level of the wind power industry is low; (4) the localization level of high-capacity wind machines is low; (5) the technological content of wind power exploitation is low; (6) the exact assessment data of wind power resources are lacking; (7) the master plans for development of wind power resources and the wind power industry are lacking; and (8) the implementation regulations of the renewable energy law are lacking.Accordingly, the strategy for developing China's wind power industry is. as follows: compiling the master development plan for wind power resources and the wind power industry; constructing a standard database for the Chinese wind power industry; implementing diverse development patterns that combine grid-connected electricity with off-grid connected electricity; constructing five national industry bases and the corresponding non-charcoal, high energy-consuming industry bases in Bohai-Rim Region, Inner-Mongolia, Gansu, and Xinjiang Province, the Yangtze delta and the southeast coast areas to form some clusters of the wind power industry and wind power equipment manufacturers; implementing the strategy of developing the wind power industry by scientific and technological means; and establishing a wind power research centre by Chinese Academy of Science and an overseas research institute, such as the Holland Energy Research Center, setting up some pioneer parks of wind power industry; making some preferential policies to encourage the exploitation of wind power resources and the development of the wind power industry so that China can become the most powerful wind power producer instead of the most abundant wind energy resources country.",,,,,Symposium on Non-Grid-Connected Wind PowerSymposium on Non-Grid-Connected Wind Power,"NOV 02, 2007NOV 02, 2007",Chinese Renewable Energy Ind Assoc; Chinese Wind Energy Assoc; Global Wind Energy Council; Jiangsu Inst Macroecon ResChinese Renewable Energy Ind Assoc; Chinese Wind Energy Assoc; Global Wind Energy Council; Jiangsu Inst Macroecon Res,"Shanghai, PEOPLES R CHINAShanghai, PEOPLES R CHINA",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,978-0-9798471-1-0,,,,,,,,,"Chinese Acad Sci, Grad Univ, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resource Res, Beijing, Peoples R China",,,,2007-01-01,WOS:000257376000025,,

These studies have mostly examined natural reef systems, but results differed. To examine this relation, we built 1 m(2) habitats with 20 replicates of five complexity levels from July to August 2001 in the northeastern Gulf of Mexico (n=100). In June and July 2002, we built new habitats using the 2001 design, but also added a sixth complexity level (n=120). In order of increasing complexity these included: cage, shell, cage-shell, block-shell, cage-block-shell, and shell-block-pyramid habitats. Most fish in both years were juveniles and included species common to reef structures in the northeastern Gulf of Mexico. In 2001, we identified 26 fish species, and the dominant species was red snapper, Lutjanus campechanus (41%), followed by rock sea bass, Centropristis philadelphica (23%), and sand perch, Diplectrum spp. (14%). In 2002 we identified 36 species, and the dominant species was tomtate, Haemulon aurolineatum (36%), followed by Diplectrum spp. (19%), and L. campechanus (13%). In 2001, species diversity and richness were significantly (P < 0.05) higher on more complex habitats (H'=1.7, S=11-12) compared to less complex habitats (H'=0.8-1.0, S=4-9). In 2002, patterns among diversity, richness and reef complexity were less apparent with only the least complex habitats shell and cage showing significantly lower values. In both years, multidimensional scaling grouped by complexity levels with cage and shell habitats showing the clearest separation from other habitat types. Also, with few exceptions (only 8%) analysis of similarities showed significant (P < 0.05) differences in fish communities across complexity levels.

It is important to monitor such areas in order to detect, understand and remediate environmental responses to stressors. The natural heterogeneity and complexity of communities means that accurate monitoring requires high resolution, both temporally and spatially, as well as more complete assessments of taxa. Increased resolution and taxonomic coverage is economically challenging using current microscopy-based monitoring practices. Alternatively, DNA sequencing-based methods have been suggested for cost-efficient monitoring, offering additional insights into ecosystem function and disturbance. Here, we applied DNA metabarcoding of eukaryotic communities in marine sediments, in areas of offshore drilling on the Norwegian continental shelf. Forty-five samples, collected from seven drilling sites in the Troll/Oseberg region, were assessed, using the small subunit ribosomal RNA gene as a taxonomic marker. In agreement with results based on classical morphology-based monitoring, we were able to identify changes in sediment communities surrounding oil platforms. In addition to overall changes in community structure, we identified several potential indicator taxa, responding to pollutants associated with drilling fluids. These included the metazoan orders Macrodasyida, Macrostomida and Ceriantharia, as well as several ciliates and other protist taxa, typically not targeted by environmental monitoring programmes.

Our examination of marine communities associated with oil platforms in Gabon is the first scientific investigation of these structures and highlights the unique ecosystems associated with them. A number of species previously unknown to Gabonese waters were recorded during our surveys on these platforms. Clear distinctions in benthic communities were observed between older, larger platforms in the north and newer platforms to the south or closer to shore. The former were dominated by a solitary cup coral, Tubastraea sp., whereas the latter were dominated by the barnacle Megabalanus tintinnabulum, but with more diverse benthic assemblages compared to the northerly platforms. Previous work documented the presence of limited zooxanthellated scleractinian corals on natural rocky substrate in Gabon but none were recorded on platforms. Total estimated fish biomass on these platforms exceeded one ton at some locations and was dominated by barracuda (Sphyraena spp.), jacks (Carangids), and rainbow runner (Elagatis bipinnulata). Thirty-four percent of fish species observed on these platforms are new records for Gabon and 6% are new to tropical West Africa. Fish assemblages closely associated with platforms had distinct amphi-Atlantic affinities and platforms likely extend the distribution of these species into coastal West Africa. At least one potential invasive species, the snowflake coral (Carijoa riisei), was observed on the platforms. Oil platforms may act as stepping stones, increasing regional biodiversity and production but they may also be vectors for invasive species. Gabon is a world leader in terrestrial conservation with a network of protected areas covering >10% of the country. Oil exploration and biodiversity conservation currently co-exist in terrestrial and freshwater ecosystems in Gabon.

The region is also economically important, supporting valuable fisheries, aquaculture and ecotourism industries. Deep-sea (> 200 m depth) exploration leases for oil and gas have also recently been activated. Characterising the environment of the GAB is a priority in light of these activities, but although areas of the GAB continental shelf have been well-studied, there is a paucity of data on benthos from depths > 200 m and a virtual absence of collated benthic ecological information. Predictive ecological modelling is increasingly being used for deep-sea benthic characterisation given the large areas involved and logistic challenges of sampling these environments. For example, species distribution models can be used to predict environmental suitability in unsampled areas, and to inform spatial management for data-poor regions. We explored options and selected the maximum likelihood implementation of the popular MaxEnt method to predict environmental suitability for 96 deep-water benthic species across temperate Australia. Occurrence records were obtained from a collation of historical museum records, online databases and recent sampling in the GAB at 200-3000 m. Aggregated predictions were used to identify patterns of suitability across species. The GAB continental slope had high relative suitability across all modelled species, particularly in the phyla Chordata and Cnidaria, while predicted suitability for species in the phyla Mollusca and Arthropoda was generally higher on the east than south coast of Australia. These patterns were influenced by the suite of species used; we found predicted suitability within the GAB to be negatively influenced by the proportion of east coast records per species. Average bottom temperature, which correlated with depth and a range of water quality variables, was the most important environmental predictor of suitability. The currently poorly-sampled upper mid-slope depths (500-800 m) of the GAB had the greatest predicted suitability across the suite of modelled species; hence recent sampling of the GAB benthos may have underestimated benthic faunal abundance and diversity in this region.",,,,,,,,,5,0,0,0,3,0,5,,,0967-0645,1879-0100,,,,,,,,,,"South Australian Res & Dev Inst, Aquat Sci, POB 120, Henley Beach, SA 5022, AustraliaCSIRO Ocean & Atmosphere, Marine Labs, POB 1538, Hobart, Tas 7001, AustraliaFlinders Univ S Australia, Ctr Marine Bioprod Dev, GPO Box 2100, Adelaide, SA 5001, Australia",,,,2019-01-07,WOS:000454184200011,,

We tested the hypothesis that reef-associated predators negatively affect sediment dwelling invertebrates, causing macro- and meiofauna to be less abundant and diverse in soft sediments near the reefs. As expected, predation intensity was greater nearer the reef than farther away, but macro- and meiofaunal assemblages did not differ significantly with distance from the reef. Taxon richness of macro- and meiofaunal assemblages were similar irrespective of distance from the reef. Only meiofauna showed significant variation in total abundance with distance from the reef, but this trend was not consistent between the two study sites. No gradient in sediment texture was observed with distance from the reef.

J,,,,,,,,,"Yund, Philip",,Collaborative Research: Does larval transport or physiological tolerance set the southern range boundary of a northern blue mussel?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Awarded Grant,Feb 13 2012,2012,"Intellectual Merit This project will test whether the southern range boundary of a northern blue mussel, Mytilus trossulus, is determined by limitations on the dispersal of larvae, or the physiological tolerance of larvae and/or juveniles. Mytilus trossulus and its sister species, M. edulis, co-occur throughout the Canadian maritime provinces and the northern Gulf of Maine. While the abundance of M. trossulus decreases abruptly south of the Canadian border, M. edulis ranges south to North Carolina. Work to date has demonstrated that: 1) Adult M. trossulus in northeastern Maine inhabit coastal sites, islands, and man-made structures that are within the colder water of the Eastern Maine Coastal Current (EMCC). 2) Drifters released in the EMCC rarely enter nearshore waters to the south, suggesting that across-shelf transport is extremely limited. 3) Larvae of the two species may differ slightly in thermal tolerance, and some evidence suggests that tolerance may also be affected by nutritional status. 4) Mytilus trossulus juveniles transplanted within the northeastern Maine region, but outside of the EMCC, have high survivorship, while transplants further to the southwest suffer high mortality. In combination, these results suggest that larval transport sets the proximate range boundary within northeastern Maine (on a scale of 10 km), but thermal tolerance would ultimately limit the distribution on a larger spatial scale (200 km). This research project is designed to test this pair of hypotheses via a combination of field and lab experiments. Satellite drifters equipped with temperature loggers deployed in and out of the EMCC during the season of M. trossulus larval dispersal (mid-June to mid-August) will be used to quantify the physical flow fields and temperature regimes during larval dispersal. Drogues will allow us to assess whether larvae at different depths may experience different flow fields. Data from hydrographic surveys, combined with regular spatial and temporal sampling of mussel larvae and new settlers, will be used to assess possible associations between larval and post-settlement stages and different water masses. The physiological tolerance of new settlers will be assayed via transplants to sites in and out of the EMCC. Finally, laboratory growth and survival experiments will assay larval performance in different thermal and feeding regimes. The investigators will use molecular markers to identify the morphologically indistinguishable larvae and settlers of these sibling species. Broader Impacts This project will provide training for one MS and one PhD student, and several undergraduates. The PIs are at institutions that emphasize undergraduate and graduate research, and our project will provide numerous student opportunities for field and laboratory research in oceanography and benthic ecology. Such research opportunities are likely to attract a number of students who would otherwise pursue careers in biomedical research. The Gulf of Maine is home to a thriving Mytilis edulis aquaculture industry, and M. trossulus is a commercially inferior species - growers are concerned about its possible spread. Hence a better understanding of the factors determining the range boundary of this species will help growers avoid M. trossulus spat. Results will be disseminated to enhance communication with the Maine aquaculture community. All of the fieldwork will be conducted in a region of Maine facing great educational challenges; teachers from area schools will be recruited to assist with summer field and laboratory work.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,1233868,,,,,,,,Downeast Institute for Applied Marine Research and Education,Downeast Institute for Applied Marine Research and Education,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:13596328,,

During the last decade, new concepts in coastal engineering have started emerging. Several technical measures with an ecosystem-based design have been developed and, in some places, already implemented over the last decade. These low-regret measures, for instance green belts, coir fibers and porous submerged structures, reveal their full potential as stand-alone coastal protection or when used in combination with each other. They are believed - and in some cases documented - to be a better alternative or potential complement to conventional hard coastal engineering protection. Concrete examples are taken from the densely populated coastal area of Jakarta Utara (North Jakarta) and the National Capital Integrated Coastal Development (NCICD), showing benefits and further opportunities, but also challenges for applied low-regret coastal protection measures and ecosystem-based disaster risk reduction.

For example, higher quality patches might have higher densities because they attract more colonists or confer better post-colonization survival. However, variation in occupant density can also be driven by landscape configuration if neighboring patches draw potential colonists away from the focal habitat (a phenomenon we call propagule redirection). Here, we develop and analyze a stochastic model to quantify the role of landscape configuration and propagule redirection on occupant density patterns. We model a system with a dispersive larval stage and a sedentary adult stage. The model includes sensing and decision-making in the colonization stage and density-dependent mortality (a proxy for patch quality) in the post-colonization stage. We demonstrate that spatial variation in colonization is retained when the supply of colonists is not too high, post-colonization density-dependent survival is not too strong, and colonization events are not too frequent. Using a reef fish system, we show that the spatial variation produced by propagule redirection is comparable to spatial variation expected when patch quality varies. Thus, variation in density arising from the spatial patterning of otherwise identical habitat can play an important role in shaping long-term spatial patterns of organisms occupying patchy habitats. Propagule redirection is a potentially powerful mechanism by which landscape configuration can drive variation in occupant densities, and may therefore offer new insights into how populations may shift as landscapes change in response to natural and anthropogenic forces.",,,,,,,,,4,0,0,0,3,0,6,,,1874-1738,1874-1746,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Georgia, Odum Sch Ecol, 140 E Green St, Athens, GA 30602 USATulane Univ, Dept Math, 6823 St Charles Ave, New Orleans, LA 70118 USAUniv Calif Santa Barbara, Dept Ecol Evolut & Marine Biol, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA",,,,2018-03-01,WOS:000425167500008,,

This paper outline the historical and the recent trend on development and management of artificial reefs (ARs) program in Malaysia which was carried out by four main departments ie. the Department of Fisheries Malaysia (DoFM), Fisheries Development Authority Board of Malaysia (FDAM), Marine Park Department (MPD) and the Malaysian Maritime Enforcement Agency (MMEA). A study to understand the developmental changes in ARs technology especially in the design, construction, installation, material used, where these changes were caused by past management policy on ARs development was done. Data and information that was gathered from past published and unpublished papers/technical reports/annual reports mostly written by officers and researchers were reviewed to support the study. Initial monitoring on the fish catches using the latest design of the artificial reefs on few locations was also done. Study shows that continuous research and development as well as management experiences by Malaysia for more than 35 years has resulted in major modifications in ARs technology especially in the design, construction, installation, pre and post-deployment monitoring, as well as material used.

Field measurements on the rocky shore of Calafuria (NW Mediterranean Sea) showed that a rise in sea level in the range of 5 to 50 cm would increase the availability of steep substrata (>40 degrees) for assemblages of algae and invertebrates by Lip to 58%, compared to current conditions. Comparisons between assemblages on horizontal and vertical Substrata revealed clear differences in the composition and abundance of common taxa. Clearing experiments replicated on vertical and gently Sloping Surfaces at 2 heights on the shore were performed to test hypotheses about the role of recruitment and post-recruitment processes in maintaining differences between substrata. Comparisons of recolonizing assemblages with unmanipulated controls allowed LIS to test the hypothesis that a change in slope of the substratum affected the ability of assemblages to recover after a disturbance. Results indicated that differences in the structure of assemblages between vertical and horizontal substrata were maintained by a combination of recruitment and post-recruitment processes, although the relative importance of these processes differed among taxa. Nonetheless, patterns of recovery of assemblages were comparable between the 2 substrata. These findings suggested that sea level rise, by increasing the proportion of vertical Substrata at the expense of horizontal surfaces, will lead to the expansion of assemblages dominated by encrusting coralline algae and grazing gastropods, and the reduction of abundance of filamentous forms and barnacles.

The progressive increase in worldwide demands for marine-based renewable energies combined with higher market demands for aquaculture-based food requires better knowledge on marine spatial planning tools that allow optimizing the use of this space for different purposes. That is the case of energy production and aquaculture activities, in which synergistic and competitive interactions must be thoroughly analyzed at an appropriate scale. The present study proposes a specific methodology that integrates several selection criteria responding simultaneously to the needs and limitations of marine aquaculture and renewable energy production, aiming to identify opportunities for the co-location of these activities. The methodology was implemented over 25 km of the coastal fringe of four islands of the Canary Archipelago, applying a multi-criteria approach based on independent probabilistic suitability and mapping analysis (time series of 20-30 years) for: (i) wind and wave energy production potential; (ii) structural requirements for aquaculture cages and energy devices; (iii) limits for operation and maintenance activities; (iv) feasibility to transport energy to the grid; and (v) biological requirements for eight species of fish. A stepwise procedure was carried out, including: 1) suitability for wave, wind and aquaculture activities, with spatial resolution of 0.01 degrees (0-1 probability scale); and 2) integrated co-location mapping, considering suitability for each activity. Opportunities for the co-location of wind and aquaculture farms were identified in the southeastern portion of the islands, while in Tenerife and Fuerteventura wave-wind devices co-location opportunities were identified. Thus, opportunities for marine aquaculture and renewable energy were demonstrated in the present case study applying a preliminary assessment of the potential exploitation of these resources.",,,,,"International Conference on Maritime Spatial Planning, Ecosystem Approach and Supporting Information Systems (MaPSIS)International Conference on Maritime Spatial Planning, Ecosystem Approach and Supporting Information Systems (MaPSIS)","APR 24-28, 2017APR 24-28, 2017",,"Las Palmas de Gran Canaria, SPAINLas Palmas de Gran Canaria, SPAIN",25,0,0,0,4,0,25,,,0964-5691,1873-524X,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Cantabria, Environm Hydraul Inst, Parque Cientif & Tecnoldg Cantabria, Avda Isabel Torres,15, Santander 39011, SpainOcean Platform Canary Islands PLOCAN, Carretera Taliarte S-N, Telde 35200, Las Palmas, Spain",Ocean Platform Canary Islands PLOCAN,,,2018-12-28,WOS:000452576300008,,

Fishes aggregate in areas of high habitat complexity at biomass levels which, in areas protected from fishing, may significantly (by 2 to 5 times) exceed levels supported by primary production within the ecosystem. High relief natural areas 'act' like artificial reefs in terms of aggregating fishes. Reef fish abundance is also affected by fishing pressure in the main Hawaiian Islands. Areas protected from fishing (Marine Life Conservation Districts, MLCDs) support standing crops of reef fishes that average about 45 g m(-2) higher than areas open to fishing. In areas unprotected from fishing, reef fish abundance has significantly declined in recent years. Conservation and management of reef fishes would be improved if more high relief areas were protected from fishing. Thus far, 11 MLCDs have been established in such areas in Hawaii, The discharge of primary or secondary treated sewage effluent into the ocean in Hawaii through deep ocean outfalls causes no apparent negative environmental impact to coral reef ecosystems. Deep ocean outfalls in fact attract reef fishes. Increases in abundance around the outfalls appears to result from increased habitat complexity brought about by the construction of the pipelines and surrounding caprock and concrete. A small amount of the variability (increase) in reef fish abundance around the outfalls may also be due to food subsidies (particulate organic matter) in the effluent. No species of fish, coral, invertebrate or algae at the outfalls exhibited any pathological symptoms. Hence, statewide declines in reef fish abundance in areas unprotected from fishing are not related to the discharge of sewage effluents via deep ocean outfalls. Rather, these declines appear to have been caused by overfishing.",,,,,,,,,147,1,0,0,69,2,170,,,0171-8630,1616-1599,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1994-01-01,WOS:A1994MN84300003,,

For this purpose and also for environmental reasons, the conventional ways of protecting a coastline appear to entail some disadvantages. An innovative and interesting way of improving surfing capacities and contributing to protect a local coastal zone is by means of multifunctional artificial reefs. A multifunctional artificial reef (MFAR) is a submerged structure that serves several purposes; in particular, it may enhance the surfing possibilities and the environmental value of the local area. This structure has some promising new aspects, too: first, it provides an unimpaired visual amenity; second, it offers tourist and economic benefits by improving the surfing conditions; third, it can enhance the environmental value of the area where it is built, and fourth, if designed properly, the down drift erosion can be minimal. An appropriate reef design in terms of 'surfability', i.e. the possibility to surf a wave, for the Leirosa beach, located to the south of Figueira da Foz, midway along Portugal's West Atlantic coast, has been investigated. In order to achieve the best design several steps were conducted. First, the performance of the Boussinesq-type COULWAVE model is tested with experimental data. Next, this numerical model is used to define the best values for three design parameters: reef angle; geometry of the reef (without or with a platform), and horizontal dimensions for the appropriate geometry. A preliminary design was achieved step by step, making use of the theory and of the state of the art of multifunctional reefs. This reef geometry is used in the numerical study. In terms of 'surfability' and for the conditions of the local coastline of Leirosa, the following values were found for the main parameters: a reef angle of 66A degrees; a structure height of 3.20 m; a reef geometry composed of a delta without a platform; a reef submergence of 1.50 m, and a structure seaward slope of 1:10.",,,,,,,,,6,0,0,0,3,0,6,,,1400-0350,1874-7841,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Coimbra, IMAR Inst Marine Res, Dept Civil Engn, FCTUC Polo Univ 2, P-3030788 Coimbra, PortugalNatl Lab Civil Engn, NPE DHA, P-1700066 Lisbon, Portugal",,,,2011-11-01,WOS:000295940200010,,

Our aim is to address a clear market demand for a system that can provide offshore charging and possibly also alternative fuelling (hydrogen / ammonia) capability for vessels servicing offshore wind farms. We plan to undertake an extensive engagement with industry to better understand the operational requirements and to address the various barriers before determining the details of an innovative offshore charging solution that will see a vessel used to host batteries and other storage technologies which can take power from the windfarm at times of low demand from national grid and then provide power to vessels when needed. The system will be fully automated with fully integrated digital recognition, metering and communications systems between the power vessel, the wind farm, shore-based operations centres and operational vessels in the field. This combination of digital systems and autonomous operations development and integration is where the unique and inimitable value in the project and ultimate commercial offer will be created and is where the expertise and experience of Turbulent Simulations will be brought to bear on the innovation process alongside the vessel design capability of AMC and the power systems capability and experience of MJR.

Such information is particularly important for specially designated regions such as recreational-only fishing areas (ROFAs). Using data acquired through progressive counts and interview-based surveys, this study quantitatively compared recreational effort, harvest-per-unit-effort (HPUE) and species composition among zonal habitats in three representative estuarine ROFAs in eastern Australia. The zones compared were as follows: (1) entrance channels; (2) lake areas; (3) artificial reefs; (4) tributary creeks; (5) rivers; and (6) canals. In most cases, effort was concentrated in the lake zones, which had the greatest access to fisheries resources. The lake and channel zones were associated with some of the highest HPUEs for key taxa [Acanthopagrus spp. (hybrid complex of Acanthopagrus butcheri (Munro)xAcanthopagrus australis (Owen)), Platycephalus fuscus (Cuvier), Sillago ciliata (Cuvier) and Girella tricuspidata (Quoy & Gaimard)] and a greater number of highly sought-after species.

Three independent measures of aqueous Cu using trace-element-clean-techniques substantiate the presence of high total, total dissolved (<2 mu m) and elevated bioavailable Cu in the water column immediately above the aft section of the wreck where the highest sedimentary load of Cu was located. Intermittently elevated concentrations of strong Cu-binding ligands occurred in this location, and their binding strength was consistent with ligands actively produced by organisms in response to Cu induced stress. The recruitment of benthic invertebrates was modified at the high-Cu location.

West Palm Beach (Florida), ISSN 0749-0208.This paper gives a detailed description of the Wheeler North Reef at San Clemente, CA. The reef was designed to grow and sustain giant kelp and the associated ecological community. This reef is the largest human-made reef constructed in the United States (70.60 ha, or 174.4 acres). It was constructed in two phases. The Phase 1 Experimental Reef, with a 9.06 ha (22.4 acres) seafloor footprint, was built between 18 August 1999 and 29 September 1999 (35 construction days). The Phase 1 reef consists of 56 modules, sized at 40 m by 40 m, with various hard substrate coverage densities (low, medium, high). The experimental reef was monitored from 1999 to 2005 to assess its performance. The Phase 2 design was based on the results of the monitoring program. Phase 2 construction began on 9 June 2008 and was completed on 11 September 2008 (73 construction days) adding 61.53 ha (152 acres) of reef substrate. The Phase 2 reef consists of 17 polygons varying in area between 0.56 ha (1.4 acres) and 15.74 ha (38.9 acres). The profile of the reef is a single rock layer rising no more than 0.5 m off the existing sand seafloor. This rock configuration was used because previous studies had determined that kelp in the area is most persistent on very low-profile natural outcroppings. The seafloor sand thickness was specified to be no more than 0.5 m with a hard sub-bottom to reduce the probability of the rocks being buried over time.",,,,,,,,,6,0,0,0,6,0,7,,,0749-0208,,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Calif San Diego, Scripps Inst Oceanog, Integrat Oceanog Div, La Jolla, CA 92093 USASo Calif Edison Co, Rosemead, CA 91770 USACoastal Environm, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA",So Calif Edison CoCoastal Environm,,,2011-05-20,WOS:000290126500029,,

The M-2 tide results in a relatively rapid transfer of organisms between neighbouring platforms. Some 60% of platforms in the southern UK Sector are directly connected by tidal flows. Such connection in the northern Sector is relatively rare, about 23% of platforms being connected. Mean flows connect platforms in 'strings' sharing a common streamline spread by turbulent dispersion. Metrics are devised to indicate how well a particular platform is connected to others. Strings are broken when contributions to the concentration of organisms from platforms fall below detection limits. Many platforms are likely to be connected in strings in the southern UK Sector, but relatively few in the northern Sector. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

The fish and other necto benthic fauna were sampled by means of a trammel net submerged at -18m depth in three stations situated at the middle and at the eastern and western boundaries of the area. The duration of the survey was one year; 36 samplings were made in the three station with a monthly periodicity. The total number of species collected was 61, 53 of which were fish; 4 were respectively cephalopods and crustacea. Sepia officinalis was the most frequent Cephalopod species, with the highest numbers in winter; high peaks in the captures were however recorded also in summer. Raja spp. followed in abundance, with R. asterias being dominant. Next came the Pleuronectids dominated by the genus Solea. A remarkable similarity was evident in the fish fauna of the 3 stations. It is evidence of a rather low biological diversity related to the uniformity of the soft bottoms as well as to limiting hydrological conditions. Comparison with the results obtained in the Tyrrhenian coast of Sicily stresses some outstanding biogeographical features. Among these are: dominance of Rajidae, Pleuronectiformes and Triglidae in the bottoms of the southern coast and lower biological diversity of the benthic fish fauna counterbalanced by relatively higher yields. Such results are accounted for by the nature of the bottom and the intense silting which occurs along the south facing coast, especially in relation to the outflow of three major rivers. A major disturbance is also caused by nearshore trawl-fishing. Submergence of artificial reefs made up of tough concrete boulders is envisaged as a proper remedy to illegal nearshore trawling as well as an effective device for the increasing of the benthic productivity.",,,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,,,0394-0063,,,,,,,,,,,"IST DI ZOOTECNIA, UNIV DI REGGIO CALABRIA, PZZA S FRANCESCO 7, 89061 GALLINA, RC",,,,1989-01-01,BCI:BCI199192015029,,

As of 2019, there are 27 platforms in state and federal waters off California, and the decommissioning of some of these platforms is imminent. Thus, consideration of whether to completely remove a platform or cut it off at some depth below the sea surface and retain the submerged portion as a reef is a decision that will occur in the near future. The objectives of the 10 papers in this dedicated issue of the Bulletin of Marine Science are to: (1) increase scientific understanding of the inter-and intrarelationships of fish and invertebrate populations at offshore oil and gas platforms and natural reefs within the Southern California Bight; (2) determine the extent of influence of platform assemblages on southern California and the Pacific coast populations of fishes and invertebrates; and (3) synthesize relevant reports, existing peer-reviewed literature, and new data analyses into a single peer-reviewed reference. This introductory paper contains a synopsis of all extant California platforms including information on: (1) the original operator, (2) the current operator of records, (3) the date the platform was installed, (4) the first production date, (5) the platform's distance from shore [including whether it is state or outer continental shelf (OCS) waters], (6) the bottom depth of the platform, (7) the number of well slots, (8) the number of conductors, (9) what the platform produces (oil and/or gas), (10) the platform jacket dimensions [generally at the seafloor (bottom)], (11) the platform's footprint, (12) the midwater surface area, (13) the total removal weight, (14) the platform location, (15) the shell mound size, (16) the shell mound volume, (17) the shell mound height, (18) the center of the shell mound location, and (19) the bottom slope.

Ascension Island and its seamounts are small, isolated and relatively young, yet harbor patchily dense life. Large areas of these waters are soon to be designated as a major Marine Protected Area. Given the remote location there are few local threats to the region. However, global climate related stressors (e.g., temperature and acidification) and arguably plastic pollution are key issues likely to impact ecosystem services. We evaluate the accumulated carbon in benthos around Ascension Island's EEZ shallower than 1000 m using data collected over two research cruises in 2015 and 2017 through seabed mapping, seabed camera imagery and collections of benthos using a mini-Agassiz trawl. Benthos shallower than 1000 m essentially comprises the coastal waters around Ascension Island and three seamounts (Harris-Stewart, Grattan, and Unnamed). There is considerable societal benefit from benthic carbon storage and sequestration through its mitigation value buffering climate change. This service is often termed blue carbon. Overall we estimate that there is at least 43,000 t of blue carbon, on the 3% of Ascension Island EEZ's seabed which is <1000 m, mainly in the form of cold coral reefs. Two thirds of that occurs around the main island of Ascension, but it is very unevenly distributed on the seabed. Seabed roughness (e.g., rocky outcrops) seems most important for the development of blue carbon hotspots. About 21% of the total blue carbon is considered to be sequestered (removed from the carbon cycle for 100+ years) = 9000 t Carbon. At the 2019 Shadow Price of Carbon the proportion of CO2 considered sequestered is 29-59 pound. As 9000 t C this is equivalent to 33,070 t CO2 , which in 2019 is valued at approximately 1-2 pound million. With time, this increases with rising value of carbon, but also annual increment of carbon deposition, to 2-4 pound million by 2030. Thus even when biogeographic values of isolation, size and age are least favorable to biodiversity, the natural capital stock and future services of benthic ecosystems can be considerable and generate quantifiable economic return on their conservation.",,,,,,,,,17,0,0,0,15,0,17,,,,2296-7745,,,,,,,,,,"British Antarctic Survey, NERC, Cambridge, EnglandAscens Isl Govt, Conservat Dept, Georgetown, ScotlandSouth Atlantic Environm Res Inst, Stanley, Falkland Island",Ascens Isl GovtSouth Atlantic Environm Res Inst,,,2019-11-07,WOS:000494856800001,,

We studied the movement, abundance, age, and growth of red snapper, Lutjanus campechanus, and the age and growth of lane snapper, L. synagris, from artificial reefs in the northeastern Gulf of Mexico. We estimated by trawling the highest L. campechanus CPUE (mean = 790 fish h(-1)) from coastal Alabama compared to any other location or time period from previously reported values. Growth rates of L. synagris appeared faster off Alabama, compared to growth rates reported in previous studies. Also, L. campechanus showed larger sizes and older ages (42 years) from this area off Alabama, a substantial increase over the oldest previously reported age (13 years). Most (74%) of the marked and recaptured L. campechanus,zus were recaptured within 2 km of their release site. Also, distance moved was not related to amount of time at large, even after extended periods (up to 430 d).

Increasing impacts from human activities, coupled with those from natural disasters, have set off its current poor state. Here, I critically overview the salient features for Eilat's reef degradation published since the 1960s. Although this reef is one of the most intensively studied small coral reef worldwide, the literature elucidates that the available results are exceedingly fragmented, offering only scanty knowledge for the causes and pathways of the reef deterioration. During the years, 1975-2000, scarcely any reef evaluation had been done and the reef at Eilat was not well characterized to establish baseline data for future evaluations and for analyzing the trends. Even the follow up studies on the extreme low tide episode (occurred during 1970) are limited and localized, and cannot be used as a model case in calibrating Eilat reef status. Natural forces affecting the reef at Eilat are understood only vaguely, and coral assemblages/recruitments, even between neighboring sites, vary markedly in any studied biological-ecological parameter. The importance of the complex networks of interactions between algae, their grazers and corals for structuring coral assemblages, were overlooked, and massive algal growths were mistakenly attributed to anthropogenic impacts alone. Whereas, no long-term study can provide much indication for future prospects, at present, the tourist industry is probably the major cause for reef decline. Surprisingly, the literature further unveils at some sites various ecological properties, such as species diversity and densities of coral species and colonies, similarly to the values recorded decades ago and reveals that the paucity of information has led to conclusions unsubstantiated by robust sets of experiments. At this stage, therefore, decisive conclusions pertaining to the causes and pathways of Eilat reef degradation cannot be reached. Four future prospectuses are outlined, including the need for implementation of active restoration measures. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

A multistep method for data validation ensured that only the fish with high-quality detection data were selected for data analyses. Brownian bridge models were used to estimate home range rather than more traditional methods because they incorporate not only detection location, but also time between detections, the path between successive detections, and location error. For a species typically described as transient, six of the tagged yellowtail snapper had high site fidelity [(x) over bar =58.4% (SE 8.4%)], and Brownian bridge models estimated relatively small minimum home ranges [(x) over bar =5.45 km(2) (SE 1.79)]. Movements were highly variable, but analyses showed that fish displayed diel and seasonal trends, and in general, were more likely to be absent during summer months or during dusk and at night.

American lobster (Homarus americanus) was selected as the target species for these investigations owing to the local commercial importance of the species. Results from each step in this process ultimately allowed us to select a site for an artificial reef at a target depth that received little wave action, had no slope, and possessed a surficial substrate type that could support the weight of a reef.

This study used baited remote underwater stereo-video systems (stereo-BRUVs) to compare species richness, fish abundance and size along 42.3 km of subsea pipeline and in adjacent areas of varying habitats. The pipeline is laid in an onshore-offshore direction enabling surveys to encompass a range of depths from 9 m nearshore out to 140 m depth offshore. Surveys off the pipeline were performed across this depth range and in an array of natural habitats (sand, macroalgae, coral reef) between 1 km and 40 km distance from the pipeline. A total of 14,953 fish were observed comprising 240 species (131 on the pipeline and 225 off-pipeline) and 59 families (39 on the pipeline and 56 off-pipeline) and the length of 8,610 fish were measured. The fish assemblage on and off the pipeline was similar in depths of Pristipomoides multidens (goldband snapper), Lutjanus malabaricus (saddletail snapper) and Lutjanus russellii (Moses snapper) among others, and possessed a catch value 2-3 times higher per stereo-BRUV deployment than that of fish observed off-pipeline. Adjacent natural seabed habitats possessed higher abundances of Atule mate (yellowtail scad), Nemipterus spp. (threadfin bream) and Terapon jarbua (crescent grunter), species of no or low commercial value. This is the first published study to use stereo-BRUVs to report on the importance of subsea infrastructure to commercially important fishes over a depth gradient and increases our knowledge of the fish assemblage associated with subsea infrastructure off north-west Australia. These results provide a greater understanding of ecological and fisheries implications of decommissioning subsea infrastructure on the north-west shelf, and will help better inform decision-making on the fate of infrastructure at different depths.

Recent decades have seen the successful replication of this effect using artificial reef structures, particularly those created in the Gulf of Mexico using redundant oil and gas platforms. Recognising the success elsewhere has led to a consideration of the potential of this approach in North Sea waters, exemplified by a feasibility study for establishing an artificial reef in the Moray Firth (Scotland, UK). The Moray Firth is an area of outstanding biological importance which, like other Scottish estuaries, is under increasing threat from the pressure of industry, shipping and recreational activities. A necessary first step towards proper conservation and management of natural resources is the collation of detailed knowledge of the marine and coastal characteristics of the Firth. Most of the existing relevant data on the Moray Firth is in map or tabular form. As a contribution to the systematic collection of environmental data in a computer compatible form, data on prioritized themes were input to a geographical information system (GIS) as a series of computerized baseline datasets. From this GIS it is possible to practise rational planning of environmental resources, based on objective criteria. It is also possible to model and evaluate the likely impact of a proposed development. A recent example was concerned with the feasibility of constructing a steel 'artificial reef from 'materials of opportunity', using decommissioned platforms from the oil and gas industry in the North Sea. The results obtained by applying established conventional empirical procedures for site selection were compared with the results of a rigorous GIS-based approach, to identify optimal locations far the possible siting of an 'artificial reef.

Baited remote underwater video (BRUV) can be used to quantify estuarine species, but BRUV-derived data may be confounded by variable bait plume area and the associated effect on relative sampling effort. This study investigated the potential effects of current velocity on estuarine fish abundance data, and whether associated changes in bait plume size are important for benthic BRUV surveys in estuaries. BRUV sampling was conducted across two zones in two adjacent estuaries, and current velocity measured with a drogue during each BRUV deployment. Current velocity ranged from 0.02 to 0.65 ms(-1), resulting in potential bait plume areas that varied by orders of magnitude. The maximum number of each species (MaxN) was processed to produce a standardised (by bait plume area) and unstandardised multivariate species data set. The two data sets, whilst developed from identical video footage, yielded contrasting results. Unstandardised data was more variable, but produced a stronger correlation between abiotic variables and community structure. In addition, repeated sampling at some sites revealed significant temporal variance in community structure when data was standardised by bait plume area. Variability in sampling effort resulting from variable current velocity and associated bait plume area may confound interpretation of BRUV data. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

These platforms come in many shapes and sizes; some stay on the surface like boats, such as the Liquid Robotics Waveglider, while others travel from the surface to 1000m depth, such as the Kongsberg Seagliders. All of these platforms are very flexible and can be equipped with sensor packages to look at a wide range of ocean properties. The information collected is then transmitted back in real time and makes them ideally suited to answering a whole range of biological, chemical and physical questions which are directly relevant to protecting our marine resources.In the face of reduced funds and declining budgets, these platforms are an excellent alternative to costly ships. They cover large distances over months and therefore also can tell us a lot about how ocean processes change in both space and time. Using this fairly new technology requires understanding how they work and having the proper tools to make best use of the information they collect. Without this prior knowledge, investigations may not be designed in a way to answer the questions posed by UK and European legislative requirements. The goal of this project is to transfer the expertise and the tools built through years of NERC-funded research at the University of East Anglia (UEA), an institute with a specialist glider group, to Cefas, the UK governments Centre for Environment, Fisheries and Aquaculture Science. In particular, the project will look at what combinations of platforms work best to avoid overlapping observations and minimise costs. An experiment using both a Seaglider and a Waveglider will look how sediment and ocean productivty is effected around wind farms. A brand new sensor will also be used to listen to the noise produced by the wind turbines and understand how this noise spreads in the ocean.Cefas' role is to monitor the health of UK waters and provide policy advice to inform future government decisions. Alongside, Cefas must expand their capabilities to wider scientific and geographic areas. Both Cefas and UEA currently have links with countries in the Gulf Cooperation Council (namely Kuwait, Qatar and Oman). This project's second aim is to cement these links, and create a pathway through a UEA-Cefas collaboration for UK industry and policy & research institutions to develop commercially in the GCC by using UK expertise and technology to answer critical questions about the waters around the GCC.The results of this internship will be made available in a scientific publication, illustrating the best approaches for using multiple platforms together.

For this study four out of the six faces (horizontal: top vs. bottom; vertical: inside vs. outside) were used to analyse the influence of surface orientation and time of immersion on benthic colonization. Bryozoans, hydroids, sponges, barnacles and ascidian's were not quantified. On the Faro/Ancao artificial reef system, the mean abundance, number of species and diversity tended to increase with time of immersion. Both recifal groups showed a similar colonization pattern. In general, the top surface of the cubic samples presented higher number of species and mean abundance than the other surfaces in study. The, inside and outside surfaces presented a similar faunal composition throughout the sampling period, whereas the horizontal surfaces were significantly different. Differences on exposure of each surface, namely to light, currents and sedimentation, may be the reason for the observed results.

Because of numerous natural and anthropogenic threats, many coral reefs are currently being degraded, endangering the fish assemblages they support. Coral reef restoration, an active ecological management tool, may help reverse some of the current trends in reef degradation through the transplantation of stony corals. Although restoration techniques have been extensively reviewed in relation to coral survival, our understanding of the effects of adding live coral cover and complexity on fishes is in its infancy with a lack of scientifically validated research. This study reviews the limited data on reef restoration and fish assemblages, and complements this with the more extensive understanding of complex interactions between natural reefs and fishes and how this might inform restoration efforts. It also discusses which key fish species or functional groups may promote, facilitate or inhibit restoration efforts and, in turn, how restoration efforts can be optimised to enhance coral fish assemblages. By highlighting critical knowledge gaps in relation to fishes and restoration interactions, the study aims to stimulate research into the role of reef fishes in restoration projects. A greater understanding of the functional roles of reef fishes would also help inform whether restoration projects can return fish assemblages to their natural compositions or whether alternative species compositions develop, and over what timeframe.

J,,,,,,,,,"Shen, Lian",,Direct Phase-Resolved Simulation of Wind-Waves,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Awarded Grant,Mar 18 2013,2013,"Intellectual merit: The wind-wave problem is a classic subject in physical oceanography and fluid mechanics with many important applications. The objective of this study is to develop a wave-phase-resolved numerical capability for the simulation of wind-waves under moderate sea conditions, to investigate the interaction between the wind and waves, to effectively capture the effect of wave breaking dissipation in the wave simulation, and to perform simulation-based study of the dynamic evolution of wind-waves. The study aims at establishing a framework for physics-based fine-resolution simulation of wind-waves that can be used by theoretical, numerical, and experimental studies for model development and cross comparison. The simulation builds on a suite of advanced numerical methods including a high-order spectral method (HOSM) for nonlinear waves, large-eddy simulation (LES) with advanced subgrid-scale (SGS) models for wind turbulence on boundary-fitted grid that follows the wave motion, and, as an auxiliary tool, a hybrid multi-fluid simulation (HMFS) method for steep and breaking waves. The wind simulation will be dynamically coupled with the wave simulation with two-way interactions. From the HOSM simulation, the wave field will provide a realistic bottom boundary condition for the wind LES. Using a new dynamic SGS sea-surface roughness model, the effect of short gravity waves on the wind will be modeled without ad hoc tuning of the model coefficient. In return, the wind LES will provide wind forcing for the HOSM simulation of the waves. Using wave breaking models, which will be assessed and calibrated with the auxiliary HMFS of steep and breaking waves, wave breaking dissipation will also be taken into account in the HOSM. As such, the processes of wind input, nonlinear wave interaction, and wave breaking dissipation will all be incorporated to the phase-resolved simulation of the wave field for the first time. Systematic tests and extensive comparisons with other studies are planned in the proposed project. Some of the proposed computations, such as the wind LES over dynamically-evolving nonlinear wave field with dynamic SGS sea-surface roughness modeling, the phase-resolved simulation of nonlinear wave field with direct wind input and modeling of wave breaking dissipation, and the simulation of steep and breaking wind-waves, are the first of their kind. This study will produce detailed data of the interacting wind and wave fields in a wave-phase-resolved context, which can shed new light on the long- standing problem of wind-wave dynamics. The results of the proposed research will be useful for the comparison with experiment measurement and theoretical analysis. The simulation data will also be helpful for the development of improved models for large-scale wave-phase-averaged simulations. Broader impacts: The topic of this study is of interest to the scientific community as well as the general public. The proposed study will lead to improved simulation capability and understanding of wind-waves, which are essential to many applications including weather and climate change, operation and safety of ships and offshore structures, renewable energy, and pollutant transport. In the project, doctoral graduate education will stress multi-disciplinary training with a focus on computation of wave and turbulence problems. Graduate student recruiting and mentoring will leverage an NSF IGERT project on modeling complex systems awarded to JHU. The IGERT project places emphasis on training in high-performance computation of multi-scale multi-physics problems for domestic doctoral students, especially under-represented minorities, women, and first-generation students. Educational outreach will be facilitated by the Center for Educational Outreach at JHU, through which the PI will work with local Baltimore high schools to expose high school students, especially those from underserved communities, to university research and to inspire them to pursue higher education and careers in science and engineering.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,1341063,,,,,,,,University of Minnesota-Twin Cities,,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:13703889,,

In the Maldives, coral mining for the: construction industry has resulted in widespread degradation of shallow reef-flat areas. Due to the loss of these coastal resources and the associated problems of coastal erosion, there is an urgent need to find practical methods for rehabilitating mined reefs.2. The slow rates of natural recovery of mined reefs has prompted interest in the potential of artificial reef structures to rehabilitate these degraded habitats. An experimental artificial reef programme was initiated in 1990 to discover whether it is feasible to use a bio-engineering approach to kick-start natural reef recovery.3. The main goals of the project were to restore the capacity of degraded reefs for sea defence and their ability to harbour fish species. Accordingly, 360 t of concrete structures of varying levels of topographic complexity, stabilising effect and cost were deployed on a heavily mined study site close to the capital island, Male.4. Within 1 year of deployment, the artificial reef structures had similar or greater species richness and densities of reef fish than did control pristine reef flats. However, the community structure of the fish populations on the artificial reef structures was significantly different to that on unmined reef flats.5. Preliminary results of a monitoring programme indicated that substantial coral recruitment had occurred on the larger reef structures which were each supporting ca. 500 colonies, some of which were approaching 25 cm in diameter after 3.5 years. An evaluation of the effectiveness of the various artificial reef structures is discussed in relation to their design features and costs and in line with timescales for the recovery processes.

This association may be due to greater availability of shelters, but surprisingly little is known about the size and density of shelters and their use by coral reef fishes. We quantified shelter availability and use by fishes for the first time on a Caribbean coral reef by counting all holes and overhangs with a minimum entrance diameter >= 3 cm in 30 quadrats (25 m(2)) on two fringing reefs in Barbados. Shelter size was highly variable, ranging from 42 cm(3) to over 4,000,000 cm(3), with many more small than large shelters. On average, there were 3.8 shelters m(-2), with a median volume of 1,200 cm(3) and a total volume of 52,000 cm(3) m(-2). The number of fish per occupied shelter ranged from 1 to 35 individual fishes belonging to 66 species, with a median of 1. The proportion of shelters occupied and the number of occupants increased strongly with shelter size. Shelter density and total volume increased with substrate complexity, and this relationship varied among reef zones. The density of shelter-using fish was much more strongly predicted by shelter density and median size than by substrate complexity and increased linearly with shelter density, indicating that shelter availability is a limiting resource for some coral reef fishes. The results demonstrate the importance of large shelters for fish density and support the hypothesis that structural complexity is associated with fish abundance, at least in part, due to its association with shelter availability. This information can help identify critical habitat for coral reef fishes, predict the effects of reductions in structural complexity of natural reefs and improve the design of artificial reefs.",,,,,,,,,32,1,0,0,26,1,34,,,1932-6203,,,,,,,,,,,"McGill Univ, Dept Biol, Montreal, PQ H3A 1B1, CanadaUniv Guelph, Dept Integrat Biol, Guelph, ON N1G 2W1, CanadaAustralian Natl Univ, Australian Res Council Ctr Excellence Coral Reef, Res Sch Biol, Canberra, ACT, Australia",,,,2012-06-20,WOS:000305693200011,22745664,

This density was re-established with releases of new trochus each month for 6 months. At the end of the experiment, there were no significant differences in algal biomass, cover and community composition, or the density of coral recruits on substrata with and without trochus. High monthly attrition of stocked trochus on the pallet balls, apparently due mainly to predation by octopus, did not allow the evaluation of the efficiency of the trochus enhancement, at the desired density, as a restoration tool. However, at the lower trochus densities (circa 1 m-2), which occurred as a result of predation in this study, no apparent enhancement of algal grazing or coral recruitment were observed. The surprisingly high predation of stocked trochus in a heavily fished and gleaned reef site stresses the importance of understanding all the factors affecting the survival of stocked animals.

Each year, the production of 1-y-old abalone has increased in the captive breeding program from approximately 20 in 2012, to 150 in 2013 and an estimated 2,000 in 2014. In 2015, the breeding program reached two milestones: (1) most successful spawning season to date and (2) the hatchery distributed 200 captive-reared abalone to 4 partner institutions within the White Abalone Recovery Consortium (WARC). The WARC is made up of federal and state agencies, universities, public aquaria, and aquaculture organizations, all committed to white abalone restoration. The next steps for the program include expanding the captive breeding program to increase production, monitoring abalone health and genetic diversity, and conducting stocking studies to enhance growth and survival in the ocean. The goal of the stocking program is to create a reproductive population in the wild to bring white abalone back from the brink of extinction.",,,,,9th International Abalone Symposium9th International Abalone Symposium,"OCT 05-10, 2015OCT 05-10, 2015",,"Yeosu, SOUTH KOREAYeosu, SOUTH KOREA",14,0,0,0,12,0,15,,,0730-8000,1943-6319,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Calif Davis, Bodega Marine Lab, POB 247, Bodega Bay, CA 94923 USACalif Dept Fish & Wildlife, Bodega Bay, CA 94923 USACalif Dept Fish & Wildlife, Los Alamitos, CA 90720 USAUniv Calif Davis, Karen C Drayer Wildlife Hlth Ctr, Davis, CA 95616 USA",Calif Dept Fish & WildlifeCalif Dept Fish & Wildlife,,,2016-11-23,WOS:000386496100006,,

However, as coral restoration emerges as an increasingly popular method of confronting the global decline of tropical coral reefs, an ecological basis to guide restoration remains under-developed. Here, we examine potential contributions that trophic ecology can make to reef restoration efforts. To do so, we conducted a comprehensive review of 519 peer-reviewed restoration studies from the past thirty years. From our review, we quantified how various important trophic interactions have been considered by restoration practitioners to date and discuss how they may be utilized to benefit coral restoration. We found that despite rapidly growing interest in coral restoration, only 15% of restoration publications considered trophic interactions, highlighting a clear mismatch between the fundamental role of trophic ecology on coral reefs and its consideration in restoration efforts. Herbivory was by far the most commonly studied process (46 publications) while other processes such as corallivory (17 publications), coral heterotrophy (8 publications), and consumer-derived nutrient cycling (4 publications) received far less attention despite their known importance on reefs. To promote consideration of these important processes in restoration, we consider how specific trophic interactions within each of these areas can be leveraged through direct and indirect pathways to benefit coral restoration. Ultimately, we argue that rather than considering important trophic interactions as emergent outcomes of reef restoration, practitioners utilize the lessons learned from trophic ecology to help achieve their desired restoration outcomes.

Further, unbiased fishery-independent samples are expensive to collect with conventional fishing gear. Consequently, stock assessments are often data-limited, especially for deepwater reef species. We estimated the relative abundance of deepwater reef fish with a double sampling approach using fisheries acoustics and conventional fishing gear (hook and line and chevron traps). Double sampling occurred within the newly-created Snowy Wreck Marine Protected Area and a nearby control site. Reef fish concentrations were identified by a single-beam Simrad ES60 transceiver with a transducer operating at 38 kHz. Hook and line samples were collected at 73 acoustic events, and chevron trap samples were collected at 20 acoustic events. The relationship between fisheries acoustic data and catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE) data was examined to develop a model to predict species-generic CPUE at unfished locations. Akaike's Information Criteria (AIC) found equal support for linear, exponential, and power relationships between acoustic backscatter and CPUE for each conventional fishing gear. Further model development would be aided by refining acoustic target information and applying complimentary fish sampling gears (i.e., split-beam fisheries acoustics gear, underwater video). Given further development, a double sampling design should be useful to estimate the relative abundance of important deepwater reef species over a wide area of the shelf break off the southeastern United States, utilizing either survey vessels or vessels-of-opportunity to rapidly collect acoustic samples.

Moreover, 1D and 3D high-resolution non-hydrostatic ocean models were used to describe turbulent mixing regimes and to obtain the range of wind speeds for which the critical anoxic conditions may occur. It is shown that wind speed appears to control the dynamics of oxygen concentrations, with oxygen depleted zones developing in a short time in low wind speed conditions. Moreover, the depth and the shape of the extraction pit contribute to decrease the mixing of the bottom layers and increase the water retention in the hole increasing the output and the persistence of oxygen depleted zones in the excavated area. The results of the numerical simulations show that the risk of hypoxia at the bottom of the sand pits is associated with higher temperatures and wind speed lower than 5 m/s, which is not infrequent during the summer season.

J,,,,,,,,,Alessandro Costabeber,,EPSRC 1st Grant: Compact Modular Multilevel Converters for Offshore Wind Integration,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Awarded Grant,Sep 30 2017,2017,"The global electricity network has recently been experiencing a large scale integration of renewable energy sources, mainly photovoltaic and wind. This transformation is driven by the need for a reduction of carbon dioxide emissions, to limit greenhouse effect and mitigate global warming at the same time improving security of the supply. Large coal power plants are the main contributors of CO2 emissions, and electricity demand is constantly growing, especially in large urban/industrial areas. In this scenario, renewable energies are the only viable alternative to reduced environmental impact and carbon footprint of the electrical system. The main drawback of renewable energies is that they are usually generated far from where the energy is consumed. Typical examples in the UK are offshore wind farms, harvesting energy in the North Sea and delivering it to the mainland. Installing wind farms offshore gives higher wind speed and minimises the environmental impact, but might result in hundreds of kilometres separating the generator and the users. When distance increases, traditional and well-established AC transmission technology becomes unsustainable for its high energy loss.High Voltage DC (HVDC) is the technology enabling bulk power transmission over long distances (>600km for overhead cables, >40km for submarine cables), thanks to its higher efficiency and lower cost. Compared to AC power transmission, DC transmission is more complex, relying on Power Converter stations to transform from AC to DC at the wind farm side and back to AC when power is delivered to the mainland. Major issues in the design of converter stations for HVDC are size, weight, cost, efficiency, and manufacturing/maintenance. The basic problem is that these converters, when based on conventional technology, can be as large as a medium-sized industrial building and as heavy as 10000 tons for a typical 1GW installation. This poses two main challenges, at both ends of the HVDC link:1.Offshore challenge: installing large and bulk converters offshore increases the cost of the platform, and reduces competitiveness of offshore wind. In addition, construction, commissioning and maintenance of the converter are both complex and expensive.2.Onshore challenge: the converter onshore is often located in densely populated areas where energy is needed but land is expensive and limited. Also, environmental and visual landscape impact are a concern. This project will propose compact power conversion topologies for offshore and urban stations that have reduced size, weight, cost and environmental impact while maintaining adequate performances. In addition, the commissioning phase will be taken into account in the explored topologies, in order to increase modularity at system level and reduce construction efforts. The topologies will be discussed with key industry stakeholders and compared to standard state of art solutions, to identify the most attractive option, and the result of this trade off will feed into three work packages: design of the proposed converter, computer simulation and construction of a laboratory demonstrator to prove the feasibility and functionality of the proposed technology.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,EP/R002924/1,,,,,,,,University of Nottingham,,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:15329701,,

In some instances, shells and sediment have buried this beam and in other instances it is partially or completely exposed. We found that fish species responded in various ways to the amount of exposure of the beam. A few species, such as blackeye goby (Rhinogobiops nicholsii), greenstriped rockfish (Sebastes elongatus), and pink seaperch (Zalembius rosaceus) tended to avoid the beam. However, many species that typically associate with natural rocky outcrops, such as bocaccio (S. paucispinis), cowcod (S. levis), copper (S. caurinus), greenblotched (S. rosenblatti), pinkrose (S. simulator) and vermilion (S. miniatus) rock-fishes, were found most often where the beam was exposed. In particular, a group of species (e.g., bocaccio, cowcod, blue (Sebastes mystinus), and vermilion rockfishes) called here the sheltering habitat guild, lived primarily where the beam was exposed and formed a crevice. This work demonstrates that the presence of sheltering sites is important in determining the species composition of man-made reefs and, likely, natural reefs. This research also indicates that adding structures that form sheltering sites in and around decommissioned platforms will likely lead to higher densities of many species typical of hard and complex structure.",,,,,,,,,26,0,0,0,25,0,28,,,0090-0656,,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Inst Marine Sci, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA",,,,2006-10-01,WOS:000241754900006,,

Recreational boating is a very important component of the diverse maritime traffic in the southeastern United States. The seasonal distribution of offshore recreational vessels in waters off the coast of Northeast Florida and Southeast Georgia was modeled using several techniques (Poisson, negative binomial, hurdle and zero inflated modes, generalized additive models, and generalized mixed models) and by combining map-based information provided by recreational boaters with environmental and geographical variables to find the most parsimonious model. Based on model performance, the final model analysis was conducted using a GAM approach with a negative binomial distribution. The best seasonal models explained between 86.1%- 88.6% of the total deviance. For most seasons, a model that included latitude, longitude, interaction between latitude and longitude, chlorophyll a concentration, and abundance of artificial reefs resulted in the best fit. The only exception was the model for the summer season, which did not include chlorophyll a concentration. Given the complexity of the study area, with a number of maritime activities and several marine species co-occurring, these models could provide information to analyze the distribution and overlap of recreational boating trips with other maritime activities (e.g., cargo ships, commercial vessels) and species (e.g., right whales, sea turtles, sharks). These analyses could be used to decrease harmful interactions among these groups and activities. Copyright: CC BY 4.0",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2019-05-08,DRCI:DATA2019070015462838,,

Recently, there has been renewed interest in developing biological indices able to identify environmental status and potential anthropogenic impacts. In this paper we evaluate the performance of a general polychaete/amphipod ratio along the Norwegian continental shelf as an environmental indicator for offshore oil and gas impacts. Two main trends are apparent: first, a contamination gradient is discernible from where production takes place compared to stations 10,000 m away. Second, the quality of the marine environment has improved over time. These results are consistent with monitoring reports employing a combination of uni- and multi-variate statistics. Thus, we consider this ratio as a relatively simple, useful and potentially cost-effective complement to other more demanding assessment techniques. Because of its strong theoretical basis, it may also be useful for detecting ecological change as a result of other activities. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

The protection scheme with linear groynes showed greater sand retention in the short term, but in the medium term, this solution enhanced beach erosion. The numerical simulations showed that beach nourishment performs better than linear groynes in the long term and have beneficial downdrift effects.

Surveys of public opinion show generally high support for renewables, with renewables commonly viewed as a partial solution to three societal challenges: meeting the growing demand for energy, ensuring energy security, and reducing harmful air emissions (Szarka, 2006). Community opposition to proposed projects, however, is still considered a major hurdle to the expansion of renewable energy production (Horbaty, Huber, & Ellis, 2012). This is because widespread adoption of alternative sources of energy requires the construction of new kinds of production facilities, often in locations that have not been used for energy production in the past.The oceans and coasts are primary examples of locations where proposals for the development of renewable energy technologies are being met with mixed public response. Despite the successful deployment of offshore wind energy facilities (i.e., wind farms) in other parts of the world, no offshore wind farms have been constructed in the United States. This is about to change, and the eyes of policy makers and other stakeholders will be focused on Rhode Island over the next two years. A private developer has received all necessary state and federal permits to construct a five-turbine wind farm three miles off the coast of Block Island. Construction will begin in summer 2015, and the facility is scheduled to begin within two years. The successes and failures of this project are likely to have major influence on the renewable energy industry and associated policies in Rhode Island and throughout the U.S.The proposed research will treat the Block Island Wind Farm as a laboratory for understanding public attitudes towards offshore wind energy. Utilizing quantitative social science survey methods, this research will reveal the factors that influence public acceptance of offshore wind energy. With several developments similar to the Block Island project being considered along the eastern U.S. coast and a much larger wind farm proposed further off the Rhode Island shoreline, research of this type is critical and timely. Although researchers have surveyed the public regarding potential and proposed offshore wind farms in the U.S., the Block Island Wind Farm provides a unique opportunity to understand public attitudes on an offshore development prior to construction, during different phases of construction, and in its operational phase, as well as how those attitudes change over time. Findings from this research will contribute important insights into a growing literature and policy conversation on public acceptance of renewable energy development. Moreover, it can inform planning for similar projects on the U.S. coasts and larger developments that have been proposed for waters near Rhode Island.Research questions to be investigated during the proposed work (see below) are drawn from the literature and through past discussions with key stakeholders. These stakeholders include Block Island residents and property owners, wind farm developer Deepwater Wind, the Rhode Island Office of Energy Resources, and the University of Rhode Island's Coastal Resources Center. Moreover, pilot work was conducted during summer 2014 via a survey of residents on Block Island and in Narragansett, Rhode Island.This proposed research supports the Rhode Island Plan of Work, which includes a focus on Sustainable Energy, Climate Change, and the Environment. Moreover, it responds to the National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA) challenge area of securing America's energy future and contributes to its priority for research on bioenergy, natural resources, and environment.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,1007596; 812914,,,,,,,,UNIVERSITY OF RHODE ISLAND,,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:12675315,,

Yet, there is limited research investigating the cumulative impacts of anthropogenic stressors on the structure and functioning of seagrass benthic assemblages, key drivers of OM mineralization and burial. Here, using a 16-month field experiment, we assessed how meiobenthic assemblages and extracellular enzymatic activities (as a proxy of OM degradation) in Posidonia oceanica sediments responded to ocean acidification (OA) and nutrient loadings, at CO2 vents. P. oceanica meadows were exposed to three nutrient levels (control, moderate, and high) at both ambient and low pH sites. OA altered meiobenthic assemblage structure, resulting in increased abundance of annelids and crustaceans, along with a decline in foraminifera. In addition, low pH enhanced OM degradation rates in seagrass sediments by enhancing extracellular enzymatic activities, potentially decreasing the sediment carbon storage capacity of seagrasses. Nutrient enrichment had no effect on the response variables analyzed, suggesting that, under nutrient concentration unlikely to cause N or P imitation, a moderate increase of dissolved nutrients in the water column had limited influence on meiobenthic assemblages. These findings show that OA can significantly alter meiobenthic assemblage structure and enhance OM degradation rates in seagrass sediments. As meiofauna are ubiquitous key actors in the functioning of benthic ecosystems, we postulated that OA, altering the structure of meiobenthic assemblages and OM degradation, could affect organic carbon sequestration over large spatial scales.",,,,,,,,,12,0,0,0,10,0,14,,,0024-3590,1939-5590,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Pisa, CoNISMa, Dipartimento Biol, Pisa, ItalyUniv Cagliari, Dipartimento Sci Vita & Ambiente, Cagliari, ItalyUniv Politecn Marche, Dipartimento Sci Vita & Ambiente, Ancona, Italy",,,,2019-07-16,WOS:000476135500001,,

The objective of this study was to advance this knowledge by investigating if an underlying mechanism of the observed productivity is related to reduced metabolic rates (proxy for energy use) of fish in reef habitats. Using juvenile Atlantic cod Gadus morhua, we tested the hypothesis that fish energy use differs between fish occupying stone reef and sand bottom habitats. Metabolic rate (MO2) was estimated using intermittent flow respirometry in simulated stone reef and sand bottom habitats over 24 h. Results revealed that G. morhua in the stone reef habitat exhibited significantly reduced accumulated MO2 compared to G. morhua in the sand bottom habitat. Likewise, there was a tendency for lower mean standard metabolic rates of the fish in stone reefs, although this pattern was not statistically significant. There are many mechanisms that may underpin elevated productivity in structurally complex habitats such as reefs, including better access to shelter and increased food availability.

The log-transformed ratios of catches obtained at the reef and the reference site were calculated for each species. Statistical methods employed to study the changes in abundance of such fish species were multidimensional scaling (MDS), Min/Max Auto-correlation Factor Analysis (MAFA), Dynamic Factor Analysis (DFA) and chronological clustering. The time-series analyses were performed on three groups of species showing similar patterns of temporal cross-correlation. These time-series analytical techniques were utilized to identify common trends, the influence of some environmental variables, and changes in group trends. The analyses indicated a decreasing trend in the catch ratio for two species groups (mostly reef-dwelling species) while the third species group indicated an inverse pattern.

We investigated the effect of habitat structure on fish community structure in five different habitats and over four seasons (during 1 year) at Eilat.Reef fish assemblages varied between habitats and sites, but not between seasons. The combination of habitat parameters that best explained community structure were average depth, distance from shore, vertical relief, percentage cover by rock and the cover complexity index. Our research indicates a high correlation between fish community structure and habitat and demonstrates the ability of multivariate methods to predict community structure in a particular region, based only on habitat parameters. This may offer an effective tool for monitoring programs to detect changes in community composition. We found that the complex relationship between habitat and community structure cannot be described by single community indices nor by their combination. Therefore, a multivariate approach is needed. It is shown to be sufficient to record only 50 of the most common species in order to obtain a community structure similar to that obtained from all the species. Our findings validate the use of multivariate methods when trying to interpret spatial and temporal patterns in fish communities. (C) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

Coralligenous reefs are vulnerable to many human pressures, thus they are among the most threatened habitats in the Mediterranean Sea. In this study, we assessed the impacts on coralligenous habitats of activities associated with salvaging the wreck of the Costa Concordia cruise ship. After its partial foundering in 2012, the Costa Concordia remained adjacent to the eastern coast of Giglio Island (Tuscany, Italy), in the Tyrrhenian Sea, for over two years. Its salvage required high-impact engineering works, during the course of which monitoring of benthic communities was undertaken. We performed Rapid Visual Assessment (RVA) sampling (using recorded video) from 17 stations located between 35 and 76 m depth and characterized by coralligenous habitats. Sampling activity was performed during the summers of 2012, 2013, and 2014. In parallel, chemical and physical water parameters were measured continuously from summer 2012 to the end of summer 2014, in order to detect any perturbation in natural conditions caused by salvage activities. We assessed the ecological quality of coralligenous habitats by applying the COARSE (COralligenous Assessment by ReefScape Estimate) index, based on the RVA approach. Slight modifications were applied to one of the descriptors of the COARSE index in order to adjust for study site features. There was clear evidence of a reduction in coralligenous habitats quality. Assemblages, slope, type of pressure, and distance from the source of disturbance played a pivotal role in characterizing bottom quality. The index was shown to have an easy and cost-effective application, even in waters deeper than its calibration specification; furthermore, the modification reported here may increase its potential applications.",,,,,,,,,26,0,0,0,17,0,26,,,1470-160X,1872-7034,,,,,,,,,,"Sapienza Univ Rome, Dept Environm Biol, Piazzale Aldo Moro 5, I-00185 Rome, ItalyUniv Genoa, Dept Earth Environm & Life Sci DISTAV, Corso Europa 26, I-16132 Genoa, ItalySapienza Univ Rome, Dept Stat Sci, Piazzale Aldo Moro 5, I-00185 Rome, Italy",,,,2017-08-14,WOS:000406436100013,,

Generating relay tripping characteristics is one of the challenging issues for transmission line distance relays as the present day transmission systems is subjected to a more stressed environment with respect to power system operation. Moreover, inclusion of FACTS devices such as UPFC in the transmission system seriously impacts the performance of the distance relays as the apparent impedance changes. Furthermore, the reach setting of the relay is significantly affected as the relay end voltage fluctuates continuously when off-shore wind-farms are connected to power transmission systems. Thus, generating tripping characteristics for appropriate operating conditions is a demanding concern and the same has been addressed in the proposed research work. Extensive testing is carried out in generating relay tripping characteristics with possible variations under the operating conditions of UPFC and wind-farm and it is observed that the characteristics are significantly affected for different operating conditions.

Shallow water substrates are being rapidly colonized by zebra mussels, potentially resulting in degraded substrate and interstitial water quality. The attraction of spawning lake trout to new, substrate and the effect of zebra mussels on spawning success was examined. Lake trout eggs and fry were collected on clean cobble and cobble fouled with zebra mussels at the Port of Indiana in southern Lake Michigan, and on each of three recently constructed submerged reefs. Egg deposition was similar among all sites except on new, unfouled cobble, where deposition was 11 to 29 times higher, depending on the collection device used. The ratio of empty egg chorions to intact eggs was similar among all sites except the fouled substrate, where the ratio was 129x higher (P < 0.001). Fry catches were similar on fouled and unfouled substrate, but 6.5 x higher on one of the new reefs (P < 0.01). In laboratory incubators, egg hatching rates were similar in cobble with and without zebra mussels. Lake trout were attracted to spawn on newly constructed artificial reefs, but the presence of zebra mussels appeared to reduce egg deposition and increase damage to eggs. Artificial reefs may successfully increase the amount of spawning substrate available for lake trout, but if they are constructed in shallow water they may not be productive areas for egg incubation and fry hatch due to the presence of zebra mussels, shallow-water egg and fry predators, and storm surge.",,,,,,,,,36,0,0,0,29,0,45,,,0380-1330,,,,,,,,,,,"Illinois Nat Hist Survey, Lake Michigan Biol Stn, Zion, IL 60099 USA",,,,2001-01-01,WOS:000167834600005,,

There has been an increase in the diversity of deposit feeders, especially the amphipods, and a decrease in the diversity of the filter feeders, especially the polychaetes. Changes are not attributable either to sediment organic matter content or to gross changes in sediment type, but are related to the significant reduction in suspended particulate organic material and sewage contaminants discharged to the Bay.

While contributing to food security, potential conflicts with other traditional activities such as fisheries or tourism are inevitable, thus calling for decision-support tools to assess aquaculture planning scenarios in a multi-use context. Here we introduce the AquaSpace tool, one of the first Geographic Information System (GIS)-based planning tools empowering an integrated assessment and mapping of 30 indicators reflecting economic, environmental, inter-sectorial and socio-cultural risks and opportunities for proposed aquaculture systems in a marine environment. A bottom-up process consulting more than 350 stakeholders from 10 countries across southern and northern Europe enabled the direct consideration of stakeholder needs when developing the GIS AddIn. The AquaSpace tool is an open source product and builds in the prospective use of open source datasets at a European scale, hence aiming to improve reproducibility and collaboration in aquaculture science and research. Tool outputs comprise detailed reports and graphics allowing key stakeholders such as planners or licensing authorities to evaluate and communicate alternative planning scenarios and to take more informed decisions. With the help of the German North Sea case study we demonstrate here the tool application at multiple spatial scales with different aquaculture systems and under a range of space-related development constraints. The computation of these aquaculture planning scenarios and the assessment of their trade-offs showed that it is entirely possible to identify aquaculture sites, that correspondent to multifarious potential challenges, for instance by a low conflict potential, a low risk of disease spread, a comparable high economic profit and a low impact on touristic attractions. We believe that a transparent visualisation of risks and opportunities of aquaculture planning scenarios helps an effective Marine Spatial Planning (MSP) process, supports the licensing process and simplifies investments.

The deep sea coral community, Agassiz Coral Hills, is located over the Blake Plateau at 650 meters, dominated by the fossilized, dead and living coral Bathypsammia tintinnabulum, with rare occurrence of the deep sea solitary coral Flabellum goodei. The deep sea coral sites were sampled with an otter trawl, outfitted with 'Benthos' flotation spheres. The results suggest that the fish and shrimp fauna exhibits high species richness in the Agassiz Coral Hills off North Carolina in comparison with a control site over the Blake Plateau off Florida.

While this ubiquitous species has been the focus of numerous studies, there are several aspects of its reproductive ecology that are unknown. By directly quantifying reproduction from digital photographs of blackeye goby nests in the field, this study aimed to determine whether reproductive patterns were linked to 1) lunar phase or 2) ambient water temperature; and 3) whether the behavior of gobies changed when a nearby conspecific had eggs in his nest. At Santa Catalina Island, California, twenty 2.25-m(2) artificial reefs were established and stocked with similar numbers and size-distributions of blackeye gobies during the summers of 2012 and 2013. Photographs of nests were taken weekly for similar to 3 months each summer. Through analysis of photographs, incubation time was found to be more than 7 days but less than 14 days. Nests, each guarded by one male, contained an average of 8664 eggs, in an area of 43.8 cm(2), with 215 eggs cm(-2). Blackeye gobies laid eggs during all lunar phases and the number of eggs produced was not related to lunar phase. Reproductive output, however, was negatively correlated with water temperature, with populations on reefs that experienced cooler temperatures producing more eggs. The presence of eggs in a nest had little effect on behavior of blackeye gobies on that reef. Additional observations made outside of summer months indicated that blackeye gobies can reproduce year-round in southern California. These results suggest a reproductive strategy aimed at maximizing total reproductive output by spreading the risk of reproductive failure throughout the year rather than optimizing the timing of reproduction.",,,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,,,0038-3872,2162-4534,,,,,,,,,,"Calif State Univ Northridge, Dept Biol, 18111 Nordhoff St, Northridge, CA 91330 USA",,,,2017-06-17,BCI:BCI201700438296,,

A Considerable number of coastal erosions have occurred along the East Sea in Korea, primarily caused by port and harbor developments. Countermeasures have generally utilized wave breaks with wide low crest submerged breakwater (so-called artificial reefs), which are coastal constructions emulating the wave absorbing effect of natural reefs with good wave protection performance. However, these result in secondary damages such as scouring near openings and erosion towards the rear because of strong currents generated by wave setups. This study suggests a new countermeasure for coastal erosion by controlling wave energy differentiated by incident wave, i.e., wave direction control method (WDCM) to prevent the critical coastal erosion expected from a massive harbor expansion project planned along the east coast of Korea. The WDCM attempts to balance disparities in wave energy caused by harbor expansion to restrain imbalanced wave energies that result in imbalanced littoral drift. To accomplish this purpose, low crest structures are obliquely deployed at 250-300 m from the coastline to manipulate the wave energy by modulating incident wave direction. This new deployment method avoids excessive interference with the incident waves, and prevents resilience by leaving cross-shore sediment transport unhindered. In order to determine the effectiveness of the proposed WDCM, numerical computations were conducted evaluating its performance regarding coastal erosion prevention.",,,,,15th International Coastal Symposium (ICS)15th International Coastal Symposium (ICS),"MAY 13-18, 2018MAY 13-18, 2018",Korea Inst Ocean Sci & Technol; Korea Soc Coastal Disaster Prevent; JCR; Coastal Educ & Res FdnKorea Inst Ocean Sci & Technol; Korea Soc Coastal Disaster Prevent; JCR; Coastal Educ & Res Fdn,"Busan, SOUTH KOREABusan, SOUTH KOREA",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,0749-0208,1551-5036,,,,,,,,,,"Sekwang Engn Consultants Co LTD, Coastal Harbor & Disaster Prevent Res Inst, 27 Nonhyeon Ro 106 Gil, Seoul, South Korea",Sekwang Engn Consultants Co LTD,,,2018-08-22,WOS:000441173100304,,
J,,,,,,,,,,,Assessing dynamic seabed change on the UK continental shelf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Awarded Grant,Sep 30 2019,2019,"Understanding the rate and extent of change on a dynamic seafloor is an essential requirement for the offshore construction industry. During the lifetime of any structure placed on the seafloor sediment movement can lead to either burial or scouring that will necessitate an additional engineering solution to ensure the structure's long term integrity. The continental shelf contains sediment in both mobile and static condition. Many recognised mobile bedforms on the shelf could be relict, forming during the isostatic readjustment of the shelf after the last glaciation and present no risk. Conversely the rate of transport of modern, active dunes is difficult to ascertain without costly repeated surveys. The recent availability of publicly accessible, regionally extensive, high-resolution seabed mapping data (e.g. multibeam sonar surveys) from the UK Data Archive Centres provides an opportunity to assess the state of sediment stability across a number of different geographical situations.. The project will adopt a case study approach of sites which might present a risk to the offshore construction industry and will include mobile bedforms (dunes), biogenic reefs (cold water corals) and wrecks. Where data sets have been collected over different time periods rates of change will be calculated in order to estimate the scale, rate and extent of change. Pilot studies exist such as Games & Gordon (2015) Study of sand wave migration over five years as observed in two windfarm development areas, and the implications for building on moving substrates in the North Sea. Earth and Environmental Science Transactions of the Royal Society of Edinburgh, doi:10.1017/S1755691015000110.However no comprehensive broad-scale mapping study has been attempted to quantify the rate and extent of seafloor change on the UK continental shelf. The proposal was first developed by Peter Watson at SSE and numerous cable-route datasets exist which would be extremely valuable to compare to previous national seabed mapping campaigns. The project aims to deliver mapping outputs, a number of seafloor 'change' maps in key regions (mobile bedforms, biogenic reefs, wrecks).

The offshore wind energy resource was classified for the historical period and for the future considering wind energy factors, environmental risk factors and cost factors whose weights were estimated by a Delphi method.Future projections show a maximum annual wind increase similar to 0.4 ms(-1) (8%), in most of the Caribbean, except in the Yucatan Basin. This increment occurs mainly during the wet season, similar to 0.5 ms(-1) (similar to 10%), associated with changes in the extension of the North Atlantic Subtropical High, which will strengthen the Caribbean low-level jet. Additionally, the moderate wind increase, similar to 0.2 ms(-1) (similar to 4%), projected during the dry season is restricted to the southeastern coast and it is associated with an increment in the land-ocean temperature difference (similar to 1 degrees C), which will intensify local easterly winds.

The results show a short-term increase in fish catch for speargun fishermen but a decrease for hook and line fishermen and no evidence for the sustainable use. The economic benefit to the speargun fishermen was estimated to be an additional US$ 1,000 annually, although from the use of semi-structured interviews, the fishermen perceived little benefit from the shipwrecks. The economic benefit from enhanced dive tourism was estimated as US$75,000-$174,000 annually and there was generally a high awareness by all stakeholders of the social benefits of the shipwrecks to the local community.

Questions have arisen regarding how this option would affect the nursery function of the remaining structure. Between 2008 and 2010, we surveyed the densities of YOY fishes at seven intact platforms, as well as six reefs and three shipwrecks that did not crest near the surface and thus might act as surrogates for topped platforms. Rockfishes of about five species dominated the deeper parts of the platforms, reefs, and shipwrecks, while YOY blacksmith, Chromis punctipinnis (Cooper, 1863), were most characteristic of the shallow portions of platforms. Over the course of the study, we observed large fluctuations in the recruitment success of fishes; recruitment of rockfishes was particularly successful in 2010, while particularly poor for blacksmith in the same year. This interannual pattern was observed throughout our study sites. In general, the YOY fish assemblages around the deeper parts of the platforms were similar to those around the reefs and shipwrecks, implying that removing the shallow parts of California platform may have relatively little effect on juvenile rockfish recruitment; however, blacksmith recruitment to platforms will likely decrease.",,,,,,,,,24,0,0,0,20,0,25,,,0007-4977,1553-6955,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Inst Marine Sci, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USABur Ocean Energy Management Regulat & Enforcement, Camarillo, CA 93010 USA",Bur Ocean Energy Management Regulat & Enforcement,,,2012-11-28,WOS:000310106200003,,

Our knowledge is too often based on observations of the deeds and misdeeds of tourism along with only a small amount of experimental study.3. The main proposals are that there should be: (1) a compilation of all studies ordered by and for the State and its decentralized services., local communities and private companies: (2) definition of priority species and ecosystems, (3) observations on the direct and indirect impacts by tourists and sportsmen on the natural environment for each one of the large biotopes; (4) quantification of the impact of recreational Fishing: (5) an integration of biological, sociological, economic and judicial disciplines in the management of the marine environment.

To eliminate the dimension effect of sub-indexes, normalization processing was used. Analytic hierarchy process was used to assign a threshold of ecological indicator. The synthetic health index was used to assess the health status of artificial reef areas and contrast areas. Sub-indexes of artificial reef ecosystem health assessments included physical, chemical, and biological factors. Assessment standards were based on seawater quality standards, marine sediment quality, and guidance for the assessment of coastal marine ecosystem health. Data and survey results of a background investigation in July 2013, and a tracing investigation in June 2014 and May 2015, were processed using the ecosystem-health synthetic assessment model. The results indicated that both reef area and contrast area are in a healthy state. The health state of the contrast area was better than that of the reef area in July 2013 before reef construction. Data from June 2014 was consistent with that from the background investigation; the health status of the contrast area was also better, which is related to the disturbance of reef construction and the evolution of the reef system. In May 2015, the health index of the contrast area declined, but that of the reef area increased to 0.838, indicating that the reef is very healthy. Health evaluation indicates that the health of the reef ecosystem in the Beidaihe demonstration area is gradually improving. According to the results obtained with the ecosystem health synthetic assessment model, the state of the reef improved with completion of construction and ecosystem stability; therefore, ecosystem health synthetic assessment is an important method for the management and development of reefs.

J,,,,,,,,,"Allgeier, Jacob",,Using novel ecosystem-scale experiments to quantify drivers of reef productivity in a heavily impacted coastal ecosystem,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Awarded Grant,Apr 01 2020,2020,"Tropical coastal marine ecosystems (e.g., coral reefs, seagrass beds, and mangroves) are among the most productive ecosystems in the world providing important services, such as fisheries, to millions of people. Despite this, they are also among the most impaired ecosystems, necessitating improved understanding of the mechanisms that underpin their productivity. This project seeks to understand the key factors that drive ecosystem production in a degraded coastal ecosystem in Haiti using artificial reefs. Past research has shown that artificial reefs have substantial potential to increase the number and diversity of plants and animals, but the extent to which this can be achieved at scales relevant to society remains unknown. This project is constructing clusters of artificial reefs to test how (1) spatial arrangement and (2) fishing pressure (fished/not fished) influence the productivity of seagrass, coral, and fish over the course of four years. The fishing treatment is being implemented through collaborations with local fishers whereby small-scale no-take zones are created around three of the six artificial reef clusters. A unique aspect of the research is that it capitalizes on the experimental design to simultaneously achieve an important conservation initiative, while testing ecological theory. Community engagement and outreach are integrated directly into the research and local fishers are being surveyed to assess the extent to which fishing occurred on any of the artificial reefs. This research represents a novel effort to integrate experimentation with cutting-edge community-based conservation initiatives in one of the most impoverished regions of the world. The project is improving strategies for conservation and reef management. Identifying the factors that regulate the structure and function of ecosystems is a fundamental challenge for ecological theory and applied science. This challenge is often framed within the context of Top-Down (TD) versus Bottom-Up (BU) regulation, but the extent to which this framework can predict processes in complex, real-world ecosystems is not fully understood. It is now widely recognized that TD/BU factors do not act in isolation. For example, in many ecosystems, consumers contribute to both TD (via consumption) and BU (via excretion) pathways. Environmental factors, including human-induced change, can further alter the nature of these interactions. Quantifying the strength of TD and BU pathways and the extent to which they regulate the structure and function in highly dynamic ecosystems requires an experimental system that is sufficiently tractable that all its components can be quantified, while still being representative of real ecosystems. To address this challenge, this research project creates a unique ecosystem-scale artificial reef (AR) experiment in Haiti to test how two factors (AR structure, and fishing pressure) alter the strength of independent and interactive TD and BU pathways to regulate the structure and function of real-world reef ecosystems. Over the course of four years, the production of seagrass (surrounding the ARs), coral (transplanted onto the ARs), and fish (in and around the ARs) is being measured, providing a quantitative assessment of ecosystem-level production across the two treatments. Linear and structural equation models are used to measure the independent and interactive strengths TD and BU pathways, and to identify the suite of directional relationships between each trophic level that best predict overall ecosystem production. Harnessing the ability to use ecosystem-scale experiments and quantify production across all trophic levels in a highly complex, real-world system enables an unprecedented test of TD/BU theory.

To examine habitat use and potential mortality from explosive platform removals, fine-scale movements of red snapper were estimated based on acoustic telemetry from March 2017 to July 2018. Study sites in the northern Gulf of Mexico, USA, included one platform off coastal Alabama (30.09 degrees N, 87.88 degrees W) and 2 platforms off Louisiana (28.81 degrees N, 91.97 degrees W; 28.92 degrees N, 93.15 degrees W). Red snapper (n = 59) showed a high affinity for platforms, with most (94%) positions being recorded within 95 m of the platforms. Home range areas were correlated with water temperature and inversely correlated with dissolved oxygen concentrations. During summer and fall, red snapper used larger areas and many fish (54%) emigrated from their platforms but most (83%) returned in <= 3 d. Site fidelity for red snapper was 31% yr(-1) and residency time was 7 mo, but the probability-of-presence at platforms was 70% after 1 yr, indicating the importance of platforms for this species. Overall fishing mortality was high for platforms (F = 0.86, 95% CL = 0.47-1.40), but since the stock is managed on a quota basis this high mortality should have little effect on total stock abundance. Thus, platforms can still provide an important habitat for red snapper, and consideration of area use patterns, fishing mortality and environmental factors can reduce red snapper mortality when scheduling explosive platform removals. As such, the present study indicates that an optimum time for explosive removal would be in late summer after the red snapper fishing season is completed.",,,,,,,,,13,0,0,0,11,0,15,,,0171-8630,1616-1599,,,,,,,,,,"Auburn Univ, Sch Fisheries Aquaculture & Aquat Sci, 8300 Slate Hwy 104, Fairhope, AL 36532 USALGL Ecol Res Associates Inc, Bryant, TX 77802 USA",LGL Ecol Res Associates Inc,,,2021-03-02,WOS:000621226100011,,

This project equipped a standard work-class ROV with a light-weight stereo-video camera system to collect high definition imagery of fish and habitats formed by marine growth associated with Woodside Energy's Goodwyn Alpha Platform jacket (GWA) 138 km offshore of Dampier, north-west Australia. ROV video surveys were rapidly performed by industry on four faces of the GWA jacket, from the surface to the seabed at 130 m, yielding 1 h and 14 min of imagery. The stereo-video cameras continued to film during standard ROV operations collecting a further 150 h of HD imagery, used to build a comprehensive fish species list. A total of 8676 individual fish from at least 57 species and 20 families, with an estimated combined mass of 8719 kg, were recorded from the vertical transects of four faces of the jacket. An additional 43 fish species from 21 families were recorded via rapid assessment of a subset of the additional, standard ROV operations imagery. The jacket was characterised by abundant Caranx sexfasciatus (bigeye trevally), Pseudanthias spp. (basslets), Heniochus diphreutes (schooling bannerfish), Labridae sp. (wrasse) and Acanthurus spp. (surgeonfish). Several fish important to the demersal scalefish fishery in the region were observed, including: Lutjanus argentimaculatus (mangrove jack), Lutjanus erythropterus (crimson snapper), Lutjanus malabaricus (saddletail snapper), Lutjanus russellii (Moses' snapper). Eleven broad marine growth types were observed with encrusting/enveloping species (brown algae, filamentous mat, coralline algae, calcite) and hard corals (Tubastrea sp.) present in the greatest coverage. Both marine growth and fish assemblages changed markedly with depth. The addition of a lightweight stereo-video system to an industrial ROV and the allocation of short amounts of time for rapid vertical surveys provided important information on the ecology of an oil and gas platform jacket.

This paper reviews recent research on the biological effects of such discharges with focus on the Norwegian Continental Shelf. The greatest concern is linked to effects of produced water. Alkylphenols (AP) and polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) from produced water accumulate in cod and blue mussel caged near outlets, but are rapidly metabolized in cod. APs, naphtenic acids, and PAHs may disturb reproductive functions, and affect several chemical, biochemical and genetic biomarkers. Toxic concentrations seem restricted to <2 km distance. At the peak of discharge of oil-contaminated cuttings fauna disturbance was found at more than 5 km from some platforms, but is now seldom detected beyond 500 m. Water-based cuttings may seriously affect biomarkers in filter feeding bivalves, and cause elevated sediment oxygen consumption and mortality in benthic fauna. Effects levels occur within 0.5-1 km distance. The stress is mainly physical. The risk of widespread, long term impact from the operational discharges on populations and the ecosystem is presently considered low, but this cannot be verified from the published literature.

Eight platforms of various sizes, configurations, and depths were sampled with a pan and tilt video camera, stationary video cameras, and a remotely operated vehicle (ROV). Differences in fish species observed, and their abundances as measured by the different gear types, were evaluated to determine an optimal sampling design for large-scale surveys. Forty-four taxa from 19 families were observed over all platforms and all gears. More taxa were observed within the confines of the platforms and in close proximity to the platforms than were observed away from the platforms. Camera orientation was important in detecting some species (e.g., groupers were only observed within the confines of the platforms). The number of taxa observed did not vary with depth or among platforms; however, there were differences in fish density with depth and among platforms. More red snapper Lutjanus campechanus were seen at depths greater than 25 M, while more gray snapper Lutjanus griseus were found at depths less than 20 in. Total fish densities were lower at platforms with barnacles as the dominant attached fauna and higher at platforms with higher relief epifauna (octocorals, sponges, and bryozoans). Red snapper densities were higher at platforms with higher relief epifauna, and gray snapper densities were higher at barnacle-dominated platforms. There was no difference in fish density with platform age nor any relationship between platform age and attached faunal types.",,,,,Gulf of Mexico Fish and Fisheries MeetingGulf of Mexico Fish and Fisheries Meeting,"OCT 24-26, 2000OCT 24-26, 2000",Minerals Management ServMinerals Management Serv,"NEW ORLEANS, LANEW ORLEANS, LA",5,0,0,0,5,0,5,,,0892-2284,,1-888569-54-9,,,,,,,,,"Natl Marine Fisheries Serv, Mississippi Labs, Pascagoula, MS 39567 USA",,,,2003-01-01,WOS:000185466300007,,

CO2 Capture and Storage (CCS) technologies have been suggested as a feasible option for reducing CO2 emissions and mitigating their effects. However, before CCS can be employed at an industrial scale, any environmental risks associated with this activity should be identified and quantified. Significant leakage of CO2 from CCS reservoirs and pipelines is considered to be unlikely, however direct and/or indirect effects of CO2 leakage on marine life and ecosystem functioning must be assessed, with particular consideration given to spatial (e.g. distance from the source) and temporal (e.g. duration) scales at which leakage impacts could occur. In the current mesocosm experiment we tested the potential effects of CO2 leakage on macrobenthic assemblages by exposing infaunal sediment communities to different levels of CO2 concentration (400, 1000, 2000, 10,000 and 20,000 ppm CO2), simulating a gradient of distance from a hypothetic leakage, over short-term (a few weeks) and medium-term (several months). A significant impact on community structure, abundance and species richness of macrofauna was observed in the short-term exposure. Individual taxa showed idiosyncratic responses to acidification. We conclude that the main impact of CO2 leakage on macrofaunal assemblages occurs almost exclusively at the higher CO2 concentration and over short time periods, tending to fade and disappear at increasing distance and exposure time.

Nevertheless, little is known as to how marine organisms respond to their presence. The composition and distribution of intertidal epibiota at different positions around different types of defence structures (groynes and breakwaters) at three stations along the Emilia Romagna coast (Italy) were analysed. Sampling covered a range of scales: meters (distance among replicate plots), hundreds of meters (distance among replicate areas) and tens of kilometres (distance among stations). The colonisation and dynamics of conspicuous species over I year, following maintenance works on two structures, were also quantified. Assemblages on defence structures were characterised by a notably low richness of species, by strong spatial dominance of mussels and green ephemeral algae, and by high rates of colonisation. Abundance of mussels, Enteromorpha intestinalis and filamentous algae differed significantly among nearby areas within stations. Mussels were significantly less abundant along the landward side of breakwaters compared with all other positions on both groynes and breakwaters. Overall, however, fewer differences, than expected, were observed in the distribution of species at different positions around groynes and breakwaters, probably as a consequence of the low complexity of the colonising assemblages. Possible factors explaining the patterns of distribution observed are discussed, including the roles of harvesting of mussels and frequent maintenance works on the structures. The implications of the low richness of species observed in terms of management of defence structures and other human-made constructions are discussed. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B.V.

Learning from Nature or biomimicry can be a powerful tool in designing, developing and accessing the next generation of synthetic materials and systems. Furthermore, biomimetic concepts will account for an estimated $1.2 trillion in global economic development, and have already contributed to familiar products like Velcro and wind turbines. Thus, there is a critical need for the US to educate the next generation of internationally-minded biomimicry thinkers to develop a new wave of innovative materials. As such, this PIRE brings together an interdisciplinary team of US and Swiss collaborators to carry out research and education in the area of Bio-Inspired Materials & Systems. Specifically, the PIRE will utilize inspiration from Nature to design new materials that can change toughness in response to their environment, are safer and more effective biological implants, will transmit nerve-like electrical signals, and can respond to the environment to initiate biological processes, all for use in soft robotic applications. A range of innovative educational and outreach activities will train US students in learning from Nature and in a bio-inspired philosophy. This training will happen in an international context with Swiss collaborators, world leaders in biomimetic concepts and research. Students will gain exposure to themes cutting across chemistry, polymers, physics, biology, and engineering in the development of multi-functional, active materials. Mentoring, diversity, cultural competency, globalization, and effective scientific communication are emphasized as critical elements of the PIRE. Nature has a multitude of examples of complex materials and systems that go well beyond the current capabilities of synthetic systems. The innovation potential in this domain is vast and a large-scale interdisciplinary effort is required to realize paradigm-changing scientific breakthroughs. To that end, an international partnership between biomimicry experts at Case Western Reserve University (CWRU), the University of Chicago (UoC), and the University of Fribourg/Adolphe Merkle Institute in Switzerland in Bio-inspired Materials and Systems is established. Building upon collaborative strengths in polymer synthesis, computational modeling, mechanical characterization, robotics, imaging, manufacturing, biology, biomedical engineering, physics, and molecular engineering, five Bio-inspired Materials and Systems projects are envisioned: (1) Silk-inspired Nanocomposites: Spider/Caddisfly Silk Mimics; (2) Sea Cucumber, Squid Beak and Pine Cone Inspired Adaptive Composites; (3) Excitable Polyelectrolyte Fiber Networks/Gels: Toward Artificial Neurons; (4) Dynamic and Functional Fibers Inspired by the Extracellular Matrix; and (5) Soft Robotics Inspired by Worm Locomotion. These research thrusts are directed toward the development of functional, programmable, and responsive materials for deployment in soft robotic systems. Faculty, graduate, and undergraduate students will spend time in Switzerland engaging in synergistic research/educational activities. An educational and innovation partnership with local thought leaders in biomimicry will guide the training of the next-generation of global scientists and engineers in this interdisciplinary endeavor. Effective science communication will be highlighted via existing programming with the Museum of Science and Industry (MSI) of Chicago. Community outreach activities include research opportunities at CWRU and UoC for underrepresented high school students in STEM as part of an expanded Biomimetic Envoys program and the development of biomimetic hands-on demonstrations for annual participation in the Martin Luther King Jr. (MLK) Discovery Day at the Cleveland Museum of Natural History.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,1844463,,,,,,,,University of Delaware,,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:14030338,,

The importance of understanding these interactions is growing as the potential rises for disturbance of the systems from oil and gas extraction, seabed mining and bottom trawling. Here we synthesize current knowledge of the nature, extent and time and space scales of vent and seep interactions with background systems. We document an expanded footprint beyond the site of local venting or seepage with respect to elemental cycling and energy flux, habitat use, trophic interactions, and connectivity. Heat and energy are released, global biogeochemical and elemental cycles are modified, and particulates are transported widely in plumes. Hard and biotic substrates produced at vents and seeps are used by benthic background fauna for attachment substrata, shelter, and access to food via grazing or through position in the current, while particulates and fluid fluxes modify planktonic microbial communities. Chemosynthetic production provides nutrition to a host of benthic and planktonic heterotrophic background species through multiple horizontal and vertical transfer pathways assisted by flow, gamete release, animal movements, and succession, but these pathways remain poorly known. Shared species, genera and families indicate that ecological and evolutionary connectivity exists among vents, seeps, organic falls and background communities in the deep sea: the genetic linkages with inactive vents and seeps and background assemblages however, are practically unstudied. The waning of venting or seepage activity generates major transitions in space and time that create links to surrounding ecosystems, often with identifiable ecotones or successional stages. The nature of all these interactions is dependent on water depth, as well as regional oceanography and biodiversity. Many ecosystem services are associated with the interactions and transitions between chemosynthetic and background ecosystems, for example carbon cycling and sequestration, fisheries production, and a host of non-market and cultural services.

We offer support and advice at all stages of a renewable energy project from the initial planning and development phase, through to providing assistance and expertise in operations and finally decommissioning and/or repowering of the assets. We are considered leaders in the field of operational services in onshore wind due to our holistic approach to renewable asset management, combining expertise from our analytics, asset management and servicing departments.To compete within a subsidy free marketplace both onshore and offshore wind farms in the UK need to reduce operational expenditure (OPEX) and hence reduce the overall levelised cost of energy (LCoE) of wind farm projects. In addition, to maximise returns on investments there is a drive to extend the life of operational assets and in order to do this the remaining useful life of the assets must be determined. Adopting a data driven approach is essential to ensure efficient decision making in these key areas.For the wind farms that Natural Power manage and service there is increased demand to provide leaner, smarter and more efficient services. To remain industry leading while being cost competitive it is essential that data are integrated into the decision-making process for the ongoing management of wind farms. An example of a success to date includes analysing data generated on common faults on turbines and combining our analysis and mechanical expertise to determine which faults can be automatically reset as opposed to being manually reset. This metric saves on average, seven hours of downtime per fault.Taking a data driven approach to wind farm operation will allow proactive maintenance to be undertaken at a time where the wind forecast is for low wind, reducing the overall financial impact of the turbine repair. This will also allow smart management of the site technicians to ensure they are targeting the areas which will have the biggest financial impact first. The main challenge is that the data are complex and disparate, as part of this project we are looking to combine data and analysis to produce actionable tasks.The knowledge gained from the data analytics not only benefits Natural Power but the entire industry since more electricity will available from renewable energy sources and this fits firmly with Natural Power's vision.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,105580,,,,,,,,The Natural Power Consultants Limited,The Natural Power Consultants Limited,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:15350297,,

Some modeling and correlative studies suggest protogynous (female-to-male sex changing) fishes may be particularly strongly impacted by removal of large individuals, but controlled experiments are necessary to test this expectation. By manipulating the density and size structure of populations of the blackeye goby (Rhinogobiops nicholsii) in the field via size-selective removals, this experiment aimed to identify the effects of size-selective harvesting on the (1) growth, (2) maturation, (3) sex change, and (4) reproductive output of a protogynous hermaphroditic reef fish that uses exogenous cues for sex change. Removals of 25% of fish established in populations on standardized artificial reefs simulated a pulse of fishing mortality with minimum size limits, slot size limits, and maximum size limits, which are used in some fisheries. Size-selective removals had no statistically significant effects on the growth, maturation, sex change, or reproduction in blackeye gobies, indicating that this protogynous species is resilient to moderately intense size-selective removals. Some trends consistent with predicted effects of size-selective removals were present, but we had low power to detect some effects. Specifically, the rate of maturation was highest in the slot size limit treatment, and the rate of sex change was highest where large fish had been removed. Regardless of simulated fishing type, populations in all treatments exhibited similar size- and sex-structure by the end of the experiment, nearly two months after population structure had been manipulated. These results suggest that sequentially hermaphroditic fishes with exogenous cues for sex change may be able to quickly replace individuals with high reproductive value after experiencing moderately intense size-selective harvesting. However, experiments incorporating additional sex-changing species, particularly with different modes of reproduction and cues for sex change, as well as higher fishing intensities or longer durations of fishing are still necessary to reconcile differences in results reported herein and those from modeling and correlative studies.",,,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,,,0022-0981,1879-1697,,,,,,,,,,"Calif State Univ Northridge, Dept Biol, 18111 Nordhoff St, Northridge, CA 91330 USAUniv S Florida, Coll Marine Sci, 830 1st St SE, St Petersburg, FL 33701 USA",,,,2020-04-03,WOS:000520951000002,,

The spatial and temporal dimensions of fish behavior (movement and/or vertical migrations) are particularly relevant for rockfishes (Sebastes spp.) because most rockfish species are long-lived and have high site fidelity, increasing their vulnerability to overexploitation. In this study, we describe the short-term (with a tracking period of up to 46 d) spatial behavior, as determined by acoustic tracking, of the black rockfish Sebastes schlegelii, a species subject to overexploitation in the Yellow Sea of China. The average residence index (the ratio of detected days to the total period from release to the last detection) in the study area was 0.92 +/- 0.13, and most of the tagged fish were detected by only one region of the acoustic receiver array, suggesting relatively high site fidelity to the study area. Acoustic tracking also suggested that this species is more frequently detected during the day than at night in our study area. However, the diel detection periodicity (24 h) was only evident for certain periods of the tracking time, as revealed by a continuous wavelet transform. The habitat selection index of tagged S. schlegelii suggested that S. schlegelii preferred natural reefs, mixed sand/artificial reef bottoms and mixed bottoms of boulder, cobble, gravel and artificial reefs. The preference of this species for the artificial reefs that were recently deployed in the study area suggests that artificial seascapes may be effective management tools to attract individuals. The vertical movement of tagged S. schlegelii was mostly characterized by bottom dwelling behavior, and there was high individual variability in the vertical migration pattern. Our results have important implications for S. schlegelii catchability, the implementation of marine protected areas, and the identification of key species habitats, and our study provides novel information for future studies on the sustainability of this important marine resource in eastern China.",,,,,,,,,123,7,0,0,43,0,126,,,1932-6203,,,,,,,,,,,"Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Oceanol, Key Lab Marine Ecol & Environm Sci, Qingdao, Peoples R ChinaUniv Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing, Peoples R ChinaLeibniz Inst Freshwater Ecol & Inland Fisheries, Dept Biol & Ecol Fishes, Berlin, Germany",,,,2015-08-31,WOS:000360435500001,26322604,

California may permit some portion of the structures of offshore oil and gas platforms to remain in place if a net benefit to the marine environment can be demonstrated. Here we assess habitats at 23 oil and gas platforms in terms of site- and species-specific estimates of potential reproductive output. We identified 17 fish species (15 rockfishes Sebastes spp.) that have potential reproductive output densities (no. eggs m(-2)) on individual platforms that were tens to hundreds of times their average on natural reefs in the study area, with the highest potential reproductive output values being observed on platforms for all but two of these species. These extreme values were typically observed in platform base habitats, and likely result from the combined effects of high levels of fish recruitment to midwater platform habitats, relatively low fishing activity on these structures, and ontogenetic habitat use (depth-specific) patterns that make some platforms better habitats for some species based on the seafloor depth where they are sited. However, spatial variability was also very high across both platform and natural reef sites, induding reproductive potential for almost all focal species being zero at the majority of surveyed sites.

At the study site east of Basiluzzo Islet off Panarea Island (Italy), gas emissions (90-99% CO2) occur at moderate flows (80-120 Lm(-2) h(-1)). We investigated the effects of acidified porewater conditions (pH(T) range: 5.5-7.7) on the diversity of benthic bacteria and invertebrates by sampling natural sediments in three subsequent years and by performing a transplantation experiment with a duration of one year, respectively. Both multiple years and one year of exposure to acidified porewater conditions reduced the number of benthic bacterial operational taxonomic units and invertebrate species diversity by 30-80%. Reduced biodiversity at the vent sites increased the temporal variability in bacterial and nematode community biomass, abundance and composition. While the release from CO2 exposure resulted in a full recovery of nematode species diversity within one year, bacterial diversity remained affected.

The importance of understanding these interactions is growing as the potential rises for disturbance of the systems from oil and gas extraction, seabed mining and bottom trawling. Here we synthesize current knowledge of the nature, extent and time and space scales of vent and seep interactions with background systems. We document an expanded footprint beyond the site of local venting or seepage with respect to elemental cycling and energy flux, habitat use, trophic interactions, and connectivity. Heat and energy are released, global biogeochemical and elemental cycles are modified, and particulates are transported widely in plumes. Hard and biotic substrates produced at vents and seeps are used by benthic background fauna for attachment substrata, shelter, and access to food via grazing or through position in the current, while particulates and fluid fluxes modify planktonic microbial communities. Chemosynthetic production provides nutrition to a host of benthic and planktonic heterotrophic background species through multiple horizontal and vertical transfer pathways assisted by flow, gamete release, animal movements, and succession, but these pathways remain poorly known. Shared species, genera and families indicate that ecological and evolutionary connectivity exists among vents, seeps, organic falls and background communities in the deep sea: the genetic linkages with inactive vents and seeps and background assemblages however, are practically unstudied. The waning of venting or seepage activity generates major transitions in space and time that create links to surrounding ecosystems, often with identifiable ecotones or successional stages. The nature of all these interactions is dependent on water depth, as well as regional oceanography and biodiversity. Many ecosystem services are associated with the interactions and transitions between chemosynthetic and background ecosystems, for example carbon cycling and sequestration, fisheries production, and a host of non-market and cultural services. The quantification of the sphere of influence of vents and seeps could be beneficial to better management of deep-sea environments in the face of growing industrialization.",,,,,,,,,228,6,0,0,140,2,247,,,,2296-7745,,,,,,,,,,"Scripps Inst Oceanog, Ctr Marine Biodivers & Conservat, La Jolla, CA 92093 USAFlorida State Univ, Dept Earth Ocean & Atmospher Sci, Tallahassee, FL 32306 USANatl Inst Water & Atmospher Res, Coasts & Ocean Ctr, Wellington, New ZealandUniv Azores, Dept Oceanog & Fisheries, MARE Marine & Environm Sci Ctr, Horta, PortugalTemple Univ, Dept Biol, Philadelphia, PA 19122 USAUniv Aveiro, Dept Biol, Aveiro, PortugalUniv Aveiro, Ctr Environm & Marine Studies, Ctr Environm & Marine Studies CESAM, Aveiro, PortugalUS Geol Survey, Wetland & Aquat Res Ctr, Gainesville, FL USAUniv West Indies, Dept Life Sci, St Augustine, Trinidad TobagoDalhousie Univ, Dept Oceanog, Halifax, NS, CanadaScripps Inst Oceanog, La Jolla, CA USAOregon State Univ, Coll Earth Ocean & Atmospher Sci, Corvallis, OR 97331 USAUniv Victoria, Dept Biol, Victoria, BC, CanadaDuke Univ, Marine Lab, Nicholas Sch Environm, Beaufort, NC 28516 USAUniv Ghent, Marine Biol Res Grp, Ghent, BelgiumUniv Hawaii Manoa, Dept Biol, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA",,,,2016-01-01,WOS:000457358000071,,

Sediment traps were set at 40 m below sea level on top of a benthic carbonate dome, formed near the Cornea oil and gas field, which was visibly leaking oil and gas around its edges in similar to 90 m of water. Other traps were set at the continental shelf edge at 100 m and 400 m below sea level on the 500 m bathymetric contour to gauge the long range dispersion of the Cornea seep. Sediment cores from the trap sites and other relevant sites were also collected. Sea surface microlayer samples of the oil slicks emerging with gas bubbles were also sampled. These were used to characterize the oil as it moved from surface slicks, through settling particles, to surface sediment. Downward fluxes of total hydrocarbons (THC) ranged from similar to 500 mu g m(-2) d(-1) at the shallow Cornea seep site to similar to 100 mu g m(-2) d(-1) in 100 m depth traps at the offshore stations. Fluxes of oil polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) ranged from similar to 6000 ng m(-2) d(-1) at Cornea to similar to 1000 ng m(-2) d(-1) at off shore stations. Principal Hierarchical Cluster Analysis and Principal Component Analysis (HCA-PCA) of the petroleum biomarkers confirmed that the surface slick samples and sediment traps from Cornea and some of the offshore traps had similar hydrocarbon compositions. However, some of the offshore traps also contained hydrocarbons from an apparently different source. This second source appeared to be background oil, probably due to a mixture of natural seeps, oil industry activities, or release from shipping traffic, and was similar in composition to that seen in previous sediment trap studies on the Northwest shelf The Cornea seep area was deemed a significant point source of oil and gas to the coastal environment that was dispersed by tidal movements across the continental shelf and contributed to settling particles up to 300 km away on the continental slope of the Timor Sea. An extension of a diagenesis model showed that 44 to 77% of the (THC) and 27 to 83% of the (PAH) were degraded in the water column. Of the remaining oil reaching the sediment surface 99 to similar to 100% of THC and 98 to similar to 100% of PAH were degraded in the near surface sediments. Microbial biomarkers indicated the presence of sulphate reducing bacteria in both sediment traps and sediments and only trace amounts of the markers associated with Archaea which together accomplish the anoxic oxidation of methane (AOM). Rather than this well known deep sea microbial consortia, aerobic hydrocarbon oxidizing bacteria constituted a small proportion of the bacterial community in the surface sediment layer associated with the largest seep plume observed at the Cornea seep area. These hydrocarbon degraders were not visible in the offshore sediments against the background of other microbes. The rapid water column and surface sediment degradation rates indicated that the Timor Sea is well adapted to degrade natural oil seeps. This rapid degradation rate makes detection difficult for specific oil biomarkers due to low hydrocarbon concentrations in sediments. Such studies are more successfully accomplished with sediment trap deployments. Crown Copyright (c) 2009 Published by Elsevier B.V.

Where surficial sediment is underlain by a marine clay the scour (to date) has been limited, whilst those with unconstrained depths of sandy sediments show scour as deep as 1.38 times the monopile diameter. Scour protection has been installed at some sites for structural stability of the foundation or for cable protection. The flow interaction with the protection causes edge scour or secondary scour in the seabed around the protection. In some cases this scour is deeper than the unprotected case.

We evaluated the potential importance of sea surface temperature (SST) and other physical and biological factors in driving observed patterns in these assemblages. Prior to this analysis, platforms were grouped into four regions based on local differences in annual mean SST. The composition of invertebrate assemblages varied significantly among the four regions, reflecting differences in the relative abundances of certain anemone, bryozoan, sponge, and bivalve taxa. However, invertebrate assemblages varied idiosyncratically among platforms within a region. Variation in platform assemblages was associated with SST across regions; however, assemblages of platforms in the southeast Santa Barbara Channel were distinct due to the high cover of a non-native bryozoan, Watersipora subatra (Ortmann, 1890). The existence of geographical patterns in the composition of platform invertebrate assemblages and the colonization of one platform by a native bryozoan with southern affinities during elevated SST of 2014-2015 suggest that these assemblages may be useful over broad spatial scales as barometers of short- and longer-term changes in ocean climate.

Some of these methods focus on the Net Primary Production (NPP) available for ecosystem functioning through the comparison between the Human Appropriated Net Primary Production (HANPP) and the ecosystem's initial NPP at a given reference year. While some approaches have been proposed for marine ecosystems, most of the HANPP studies focus on terrestrial systems. This study highlights the relation between the HANPP methods and the production of natural resources in marine ecosystems. The linkage between current overfishing and future fish provisioning (ecosystem service) is well known. However, less studied before, is the relation between seaweed aquaculture and fish provisioning through the marine food web. Seaweed growth requires nutrients and light that will consequently be no longer available for natural phytoplankton production. As seaweed is periodically harvested, a fraction of the ecosystem's NPP (HANPP) is no longer available for ecosystem production. The HANPP of aquaculture reduces the ecosystem carrying capacity and thus affects commercial fish stocks. Therefore, an integrative approach is proposed in this study to assess the potential effect of seaweed farming on fish landings in the Greater North Sea. Three indicators are proposed to assess the Lost Potential Yield (LPY) in fish landings: LPYB, LPYV and LPYE, accounting respectively for reduction in biomass, monetary value and eco-exergy. For these three aspects, the LPY results remains smaller than the seaweed production, meaning that the overall natural resources balance for seaweed farming is positive.",,,,,,,,,8,1,0,0,6,0,9,,,2211-9264,,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Ghent, Dept Green Chem & Technol, Coupure Links 653, B-9000 Ghent, BelgiumUniv Ghent, Marine Biol, Dept Biol, Krijgslaan 281-S8, B-9000 Ghent, BelgiumUniv Utrecht, Royal Netherlands Inst Sea Res, Dept Coastal Syst, Landsdiep 4, NL-1797 Texel, NetherlandsUniv Ghent, Dept Ind Biol Sci, Graaf Karel de Goedelaan 5, B-8500 Kortrijk, BelgiumAgroParisTech, CEBB, Chaire Agrobiotechnol Ind ABI, Rue Des Terres Rouges 3, F-51110 Pomacle, France",,,,2018-10-29,WOS:000447187700020,,

Density and biomass were assessed through a stationary hydroacoustic technique using an appropriately adapted SIMRAD EY500 system. Part of the system was placed inside the reef and it was linked by radio-modem to the Institute. Four ES120 split-beam acoustic transducers were used. The data gave useful information about the daily behaviour of the fish assemblage living at the reef. during the whole period the lowest densities were generally recorded in the early afternoon, whilst the highest abundances were commonly observed late in the night and early in the morning. It was confirmed that in late summer-early autumn, most of the reef fishes migrated from the coastal shallow waters to offshore. Throughout the study period fish abundance was higher inside the reef and decreased significantly at a distance of about 80 m. Moreover, the fish assemblage did not appear to be homogeneously distributed inside the reef. The highest values were recorded in the central part of the area where several structures of different shape were placed. (C) 2002 International Council for the Exploration of the Sea.

The passive listening technique allowed the collection of fish presence/absence data, the analysis of the contribution of different sound categories to the total sound production, as well as a quantitative evaluation of the fish acoustic activity. The passive listening survey proved to be successful in detecting S. umbra drumming sounds in two Venetian inlets and on a natural rocky habitat, whereas this species was absent in the inner Venice lagoon. Within one of the two inlets, pulse rate was positively related to the nearest distance of the listening points to an artificial rocky reef. The meta-analysis allowed the identification of a 16-species cluster significantly associated with S. umbra, a large number of which represent commercially important species.

The deep-sea floor ecosystem is one of the largest on the planet, covering roughly 60% of the Earth's solid surface. Despite this vast size, our knowledge of the deep sea is poor relative to other marine ecosystems, and future human threats are difficult to predict. Low productivity, low physical energy, low biological rates, and the vastness of the soft-sediment deep sea create an unusual suite of conservation challenges relative to shallow water. The numerous, but widely spaced, island habitats of the deep ocean (for example seamounts, hydrothermal vents and submarine canyons) differ from typical deep-sea soft sediments in substrate type (hard) and levels of productivity (often high); these habitats will respond differently to anthropogenic impacts and climate change. The principal human threats to the deep sea are the disposal of wastes (structures, radioactive wastes, munitions and carbon dioxide), deep-sea fishing, oil and gas extraction, marine mineral extraction, and climate change. Current international regulations prohibit deep-sea dumping of structures, radioactive waste and munitions. Future disposal activities that could be significant by 2025 include deep-sea carbon-dioxide sequestration, sewage-sludge emplacement and dredge-spoil disposal. As fish stocks dwindle in the upper ocean, deep-sea fisheries are increasingly targeted. Most (perhaps all) of these deep-sea fisheries are not sustainable in the long term given current management practices; deep-sea fish are long-lived, slow growing and very slow to recruit in the face of sustained fishing pressure. Oil and gas exploitation has begun, and will continue, in deep water, creating significant localized impacts resulting mainly from accumulation of contaminated drill cuttings. Marine mineral extraction, in particular manganese nodule mining, represents one of the most significant conservation challenges in the deep sea. The vast spatial scales planned for nodule mining dwarf other potential direct human impacts. Nodule-mining disturbance will likely affect tens to hundreds of thousands of square kilometres with ecosystem recovery requiring many decades to millions of years (for nodule regrowth). Limited knowledge of the taxonomy, species structure, biogeography and basic natural history of deep-sea animals prevents accurate assessment of the risk of species extinctions from large-scale mining. While there are close linkages between benthic, pelagic and climatic processes, it is difficult to predict the impact of climate change on deep-sea benthic ecosystems; it is certain, however, that changes in primary production in surface waters will alter the standing stocks in the food-limited, deep-sea benthic. Long time-series studies from the abyssal North Pacific and North Atlantic suggest that even seemingly stable deep-sea ecosystems may exhibit change in key ecological parameters on decadal time scales. The causes of these decadal changes remain enigmatic. Compared to the rest of the planet, the bulk of the deep sea will probably remain relatively unimpacted by human activities and climate change in the year 2025. However, increased pressure on terrestrial resources will certainly lead to an expansion of direct human activities in the deep sea, and to direct and indirect environmental impacts. Because so little is known about this remote environment, the deep-sea ecosystem may well be substantially modified before its natural state is fully understo",,,,,,,,,228,4,1,0,174,1,257,,,0376-8929,1469-4387,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Hawaii Manoa, Dept Oceanog, Honolulu, HI 96822 USANat Hist Museum, Dept Zool, London SW7 5BD, England",,,,2003-09-01,WOS:000185873100002,,

The keys themselves consist of an inland fossil reef with fossil tidal bars at either end. Offshore, the colorful coral reefs and organisms we regard as being among our national treasures cap the massive ancient reefs. Embedded in this scenic submarine tapestry are records of complex, dynamic natural processes that govern how the reefs and their associated biota and sediments formed and changed through geologic time. This database-synthesis project was undertaken to examine these processes in depth and to capture and consolidate more than 60 years of geologic and biologic research conducted by the USGS and by others in a contiguous area of the Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary. The goal was to produce a digitized regional database and comprehensive one-volume reference source for the area between central Key Largo and Halfmoon Shoal. This report is the result. The emphasis in this report is on geologic and biologic changes along the Florida reef tract as sea level rose and fell over tens of thousands of years, but impacts of historical events on time scales of human interest are also included[long dash]from installation of lighthouses and development of the Overseas Railway to offshore exploration (for oil and gas) and marine archaeology (recovery of shipwrecks and their treasures). The difficulty of distinguishing deleterious effects of human activities from those of the many adverse natural stressors affecting the reef ecosystem is also now of interest, as well as concern. Information in this report may contribute to understanding the causes of reef decline observed today. Scientific perspectives offered encompass global, regional, and local scales: climatology, sea-level fluctuations, ancient environments; the rock record in modern coral reefs, including geomorphology, stratigraphy, ground- and surface-water hydrology, and karst topography; the biologic record, including natural changes in (a) coral species, (b) annual skeletal-coral bands, and (c) skeletal sand-grain percentages as responses to changing environment; and the imprint of human activities. Although specific to reefs of the Florida Keys, principles and perspectives set forth in the updated maps and shelf-edge-model datasets can be applied to understanding development of shallow-water coral reef systems anywhere, whether modern or ancient. From a different viewpoint, knowledge gained from the study of modern coral reefs and their sediments is not limited to learning how older, local (underlying) reefs and sediments formed in the past. Large-scale geometric patterns and biogeologic processes observed in the modern carbonate setting are important tools to interpret what is seen in the very ancient limestone record (e.g., see papers in Scholle et al., 1983), even when the primary carbonate components are different (e.g., Shinn et al., 1983). Use of artificial components in modern sediments to replicate microscopic aspects of the rock record has also proven to be of benefit (e.g., Brown, 1969; Shinn et al., 1977b; Shinn and Robbin, 1983). These tools of modern patterns and processes are invaluable when applied, as intended in the field of geology, to fulfill the basic tenet of geology: the present is the key to the past.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,1044-9612,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2007-01-01,ZOOREC:ZOOR14602014011,,

Besides directly CaCO3 exploitation, these diverse ecosystems within the Brazilian economic exclusive zone are often covering potentially sites for oil and gas extraction. The IBAMA (Environmental Agency of the Brazilian government) have been applying the precautionary principle to deny requests for oil/gas drilling activities where rhodolith beds occur. Here, we discuss recent data about diversity associated with rhodoliths and also record the rare worm Nuchalosyllis cf. maiteae. More than the distribution of one only species, our finding is an emblematic example of our infancy knowledge state about diversity associated with rhodolith beds in southwestern Atlantic.

Few studies, however, have examined the response of nekton to structural complexity within oyster reefs. We used a quantitative sampling technique to examine how the presence and complexity of experimental oyster reefs influence the abundance, biomass, and distribution of nekton by sampling reefs 4 months and 16 months post-construction. Experimental oyster reefs were colonized immediately by resident fishes and decapod crustaceans, and reefs supported a distinct nekton assemblage compared to mud-bottom habitat. Neither increased reef complexity, nor age of the experimental reef resulted in further changes in nekton assemblages or increases in nekton abundance or diversity. The presence of oyster reefs per se was the most important factor determining nekton usage. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

In addition to a standard boxcorer for common macrofauna, a Triple-D dredge was used to collect longer-lived, more sparsely distributed infauna and epifauna. Multivariate analysis did not reveal any difference between the assemblages in and outside OWEZ with respect to abundance, biomass, and production after a 5-year closure. The Shannon-Wiener diversity index pointed to a significantly higher diversity in OWEZ compared with some of the reference areas. A minority of the bivalve species assumed to be sensitive to trawling showed higher abundances (Spisula solida) or larger sizes (Tellina fabula, Ensis directus) in OWEZ than in some of the reference areas. In general, samples collected with the Triple-D showed more differences between areas than boxcore samples. No evidence was also found that the species composition in OWEZ relative to the reference areas had changed in the period between 1 (2007) and 5 (2011) years after closure. The change observed in all areas between 2007 and 2011 was mainly due to relatively small variations in species abundances. In conclusion, 5 years after the closure of OWEZ to fisheries, only subtle changes were measured in the local benthic community, i.e. a higher species diversity and an increased abundance and lengths of some bivalves. Depleted adult stocks, faunal patchiness, and a limited time for recovery (5 years) might explain that a significant recovery could not be found. The current study shows that designation of large-scale marine protected areas as planned for the North Sea will not automatically imply that restoration of benthic assemblages can be expected within a relatively short period of years.",,,,,,,,,22,2,0,0,18,0,26,,,1054-3139,1095-9289,,,,,,,,,,"NIOZ Royal Netherlands Inst Sea Res, NL-1790 AB Den Burg, Texel, NetherlandsIMARES Wageningen UR, NL-1790 AD Den Burg, Texel, Netherlands",,,,2015-04-22,WOS:000351837500020,,

However, specimens collected at sites near the cage farm (as the experimental sites) exhibited lower delta C-13 and higher delta N-15 signatures compared to those from reference sites. Similar trends also occurred in the zooplankton and detritus, two major food sources for both damselfishes.

The near real-time (within 24 h) capability of the Argos satellite system can aid dynamic ocean management of human activities by informing when animals enter wind farms, shipping lanes, and other intensive use zones. This capability also facilitates the use of ocean observations from animal-borne sensors in operational ocean forecasting models. Such near real-time data provision requires rapid, reliable quality control to deal with error-prone Argos locations. Methods We formulate a continuous-time state-space model to filter the three types of Argos location data (Least-Squares, Kalman filter, and Kalman smoother), accounting for irregular timing of observations. Our model is deliberately simple to ensure speed and reliability for automated, near real-time quality control of Argos location data. We validate the model by fitting to Argos locations collected from 61 individuals across 7 marine vertebrates and compare model-estimated locations to contemporaneous GPS locations. We then test assumptions that Argos Kalman filter/smoother error ellipses are unbiased, and that Argos Kalman smoother location accuracy cannot be improved by subsequent state-space modelling. Results Estimation accuracy varied among species with Root Mean Squared Errors usually <5 km and these decreased with increasing data sampling rate and precision of Argos locations. Including a model parameter to inflate Argos error ellipse sizes in the north - south direction resulted in more accurate location estimates. Finally, in some cases the model appreciably improved the accuracy of the Argos Kalman smoother locations, which should not be possible if the smoother is using all available information. Conclusions Our model provides quality-controlled locations from Argos Least-Squares or Kalman filter data with accuracy similar to or marginally better than Argos Kalman smoother data that are only available via fee-based reprocessing. Simplicity and ease of use make the model suitable both for automated quality control of near real-time Argos data and for manual use by researchers working with historical Argos data.",,,,,,,,,52,1,0,0,41,0,59,,,2051-3933,,,,,,,,,,,"Macquarie Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Sydney, NSW, AustraliaCSIRO Oceans & Atmosphere, Hobart, Tas, AustraliaUniv Calif Santa Cruz, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USAUniv Exeter, Environm & Sustainabil Inst, Penryn, EnglandUniv St Andrews, Scottish Oceans Inst, Sea Mammal Res Unit, St Andrews, Fife, ScotlandCNRS, Chize, FranceGovt Western Australia, Dept Biodivers Conservat & Attract, Kensington, NSW, AustraliaUniv Tasmania, Inst Marine & Antarctic Studies, Hobart, Tas, AustraliaSydney Inst Marine Sci, Mosman, Australia",Govt Western Australia,,,2020-08-06,WOS:000552302200001,32695402,

Although the potential environmental impacts of offshore oil and gas activities are widely recognized, there is limited understanding of their impacts on migratory and resident birds. A literature review identified 24 studies and reports of bird-platform interactions, most being qualitative and half having been peer-reviewed. The most frequently observed effect, for seabirds and landbirds, is attraction and sometimes collisions associated with lights and flares; episodic events have caused the deaths of hundreds or even thousands of birds. Though typically unpredictable, anecdotally, it is known that poor weather, such as fog, precipitation and low cloud cover, can exacerbate the effect of nocturnal attraction to lights, especially when coincidental with bird migrations. Other effects include provision of foraging and roosting opportunities, increased exposure to oil and hazardous environments, increased exposure to predators, or repulsion from feeding sites. Current approaches to monitoring birds at offshore platforms have focused on observer-based methods which can offer species-level bird identification, quantify seasonal patterns of relative abundance and distribution, and document avian mortality events and underlying factors. Observer-based monitoring is time-intensive, limited in spatial and temporal coverage, and suffers without clear protocols and when not conducted by trained, independent observers. These difficulties are exacerbated because deleterious bird-platform interaction is episodic and likely requires the coincidence of multiple factors (e.g., darkness, cloud, fog, rain conditions, occurrence of birds in vicinity). Collectively, these considerations suggest a need to implement supplemental systems for monitoring bird activities around offshore platforms. Instrument-based approaches, such as radar, cameras, acoustic recordings, and telemetry, hold promise for continuous monitoring. Recommendations are provided for a rigorous and comprehensive monitoring approach within an adaptive management framework. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

The marine environment will play a key role in hosting or supporting these new energy strategies. However, it is unclear how the construction, operation and eventual decommissioning of these energy systems, and their related infrastructure, will impact the marine environment, the ecosystem services (i.e. cultural, regulating, provisioning and supporting) and in turn the benefits it provides for human well-being. This uncertainty stems from a lack of research that has synthesised into a common currency the various effects of each energy sector on marine ecosystems and the benefits humans derive from it. To address this gap, the present study reviews existing ecosystem impact studies for offshore components of nuclear, offshore wind, offshore gas and offshore oil sectors and translates them into the common language of ecosystem service impacts that can be used to evaluate current policies. The results suggest that differences exist in the way in which energy systems impact ecosystem services, with the nuclear sector having a predominantly negative impact on cultural ecosystem services; oil and gas a predominately negative impact on cultural, provisioning, regulating and supporting ecosystem services; while wind has a mix of impacts on cultural, provisioning and supporting services and an absence of studies for regulating services. This study suggests that information is still missing with regard to the full impact of these energy sectors on specific types of benefits that humans derive from the marine environment and proposes possible areas of targeted research.

Such operations are expanding to previously inaccessible deep waters and other frontier regions, while conservation-related legislation and planning is often lacking. Conservation challenges arising from offshore hydrocarbon development are wide-ranging. These challenges include threats to ecosystems and marine species from oil spills, negative impacts on native biodiversity from invasive species colonizing drilling infrastructure, and increased political conflicts that can delay conservation actions. With mounting offshore operations, conservationists need to urgently consider some possible opportunities that could be leveraged for conservation. Leveraging options, as part of multi-billion dollar marine hydrocarbon operations, include the use of facilities and costly equipment of the deep and ultra-deep hydrocarbon industry for deep-sea conservation research and monitoring and establishing new conservation research, practice, and monitoring funds and environmental offsetting schemes. The conservation community, including conservation scientists, should become more involved in the earliest planning and exploration phases and remain involved throughout the operations so as to influence decision making and promote continuous monitoring of biodiversity and ecosystems. A prompt response by conservation professionals to offshore oil and gas developments can mitigate impacts of future decisions and actions of the industry and governments.

Fishing location, number of fish per line per hour (catch per unit effort), and presence of baitfish from the tournament data were examined in the context of bathymetric gradients and other benthic features (e.g., wrecks or artificial reefs), and the location and persistence of oceanic fronts mapped using satellite imagery of sea surface temperature (AVHRR) and ocean color (MODIS and SeaWiFS). Generalized linear models were applied to identify the relationship between king mackerel catch rates and environmental data. The distance of fishing activity to the nearest front varied substantially, particularly when winds and front position were variable. However, baitfish presence with proximity to water clarity fronts (as defined by water-leaving radiance at 443 nm) significantly influenced successful king mackerel catch. Positive catch rates were significantly influenced by chlorophyll values and period (season and year). Additionally, intermediate water clarity (in the range 0.7-1.0 mW cm(-2) mu m(-1) sr(-1)) led to higher catch rates. Decreased water quality, primarily associated with a large Karenia brevis red tide, led to a lower number of catch and lower catch rates (122 king mackerel, 0.13 catch per unit effort) in fall 2005, compared to spring 2004 (179, 0.14), fall 2004 (360, 0.17) and spring 2005 (296, 0.21), despite a consistent seasonal effort.",,,,,,,,,13,0,0,0,8,0,15,,,1054-6006,1365-2419,,,,,,,,,,"Univ S Florida, Coll Marine Sci, St Petersburg, FL 33701 USAUniv Massachusetts Dartmouth, Sch Marine Sci & Technol, New Bedford, MA 02744 USARoffers Ocean Fishing Forecasting Serv Inc ROFFST, W Melbourne, FL 32904 USA",Roffers Ocean Fishing Forecasting Serv Inc ROFFST,,,2009-01-01,WOS:000265771100005,,

The QICS (Quantifying and Monitoring Potential Ecosystem Impacts of Geological Carbon Storage), ETI MMV (Energy Technologies Institute Measurement, Monitoring and Verification of CO2 Storage), and STEMM-CCS (Strategies for Environmental Monitoring of Marine CCS) projects collectively represent over twelve years of dedicated research to assess environmental impacts and to develop technologies for detection, location, and quantification of potential leakage from offshore geological storage of CO2. Each project used controlled releases in representative environments to test their methods and technologies. QICS as the first of the three projects, focused on the understanding of sensitivities of the UK marine environment to a potential leak from a CO2 storage complex and tested technologies to detect such emissions. The ETI MMV project brought together research and industry partners to develop and sea trial an operational, integrated and cost-effective marine monitoring system for geological CO2 storage. As a commercial project, these results have never been published before and this paper shares for the first-time insights from this work. In February 2020, STEMM-CCS, completed its quest to test techniques for environmental monitoring over a marine CO2 storage site in the UK North Sea, further improved near seabed leakage characterisation capabilities, and delivered a first marine CCS demonstration level ecological baseline. This paper aims to summarise some of the key insights from the three projects and provides references where available for the interested reader. The key finding of all three projects is that the impacts of small to medium CO2 leakages from large-scale storage are limited and localised. Technology capabilities exist for integrated marine CO2 storage monitoring and their performance has been benchmarked at controlled release trials. Even small leakages of 10-50 L/min can be detected at unknown locations in a large area of interest. Finally, the first important steps towards automated monitoring data analysis have been made, including automated leakage signal detection from Side Scan Sonar data (ETI MMV project) and automated species identification from marine biology images (STEMM-CCS project). Some remaining challenges include missed/false alerts because of large variations in the background signal, the cost of monitoring large areas over long periods, and making real-time decisions based on big data. Continued work to reduce the cost of marine monitoring technologies and advancing automation of data processing and analysis will be important in order to support safe and efficient offshore CCS deployment at large scale.",,,,,,,,,31,2,0,0,2,0,33,,,1750-5836,1878-0148,,,,,,,,,,"Shell Global Solut Int BV, The Hague, NetherlandsPlymouth Marine Lab, Plymouth, Devon, EnglandNatl Oceanog Ctr, Southampton, Hants, EnglandSonardyne, Yateley, England",Sonardyne,,,2020-09-23,WOS:000567882300002,,

Paradoxically, dismantlement is paid for by the shipowners in accordance with international conventions therefore it is more profitable for them to sell off ships destined for scrapping. Scuttling, the alternative to scrapping, is assessed in the present review to compare the cost/benefit ratios of the two approaches. Although scrapping provides employment and raw materials - but with environmental, health and safety costs - scuttling provides fisheries and diving tourism opportunities but needs appropriate management to avoid organic and metal pollution, introduction of invasive species and exacerbation of coastal erosion.

The attraction of people to coastal zones is contributing to an intense and continuous urbanization of these areas, while the ecosystems are threatened by the increase of natural extreme weather events (e.g., intensity and duration of storms, floods), which interfere with local wave climate and changes in morphological beach characteristics. Protection of coastal zones predisposed to coastline recession, due to the action of high tides, high sediment transport deficit, and high wave energy, may involve various coastal structures to reduce or at least to mitigate coastal erosion problems. Many of the current coastal protections (notably groins, seawalls, and emerged breakwaters) were built with a single purpose, which was to protect at all costs without environmental or economic concerns, especially maintenance costs, or the negative consequences that such structures could cause up to considerable distances along the coast. The current concept of integrated coastal zone management presupposes studies involving other types of concerns and more actors in the decision-making process for the implementation of coastal works. In this context, multifunctional structures emerge and are increasingly frequent, such as the so-called multifunctional artificial reefs (MFARs), with the aim of improving leisure, fishing, diving, and other sporting activities, in addition to coastal protection. MFARs are in fact one of the latest concepts for coastal protection. Behind the search for more efficient and sustainable strategies to deal with coastal retreat, this study focused on a comparison between the performance of two traditional coastal protection solutions (submerged detached breakwater and emerged detached breakwater) and an MFAR on a particular coastal stretch. In order to analyse the hydro- (wave height and wave energy dissipation) and morphodynamics (sediment accumulation and erosion areas, and bed level) of the structures and beach interactions, two numerical models were used: SWAN (Simulation WAves Nearshore) for hydrodynamics and XBeach for hydrodynamics and morphodynamics. In addition, a comparison between SWAN and XBeach hydrodynamic results was also performed. From the simulations conducted by SWAN and XBeach, it can be concluded that amongst all structures, the emerged detached breakwater was the most efficient in reducing significant wave heights at a larger scale due to the fact that it constituted a higher obstacle to the incoming waves, and that, regarding both submerged structures (detached breakwater and the MFAR), the MFAR presented a more substantial shadow zone. Regarding morphodynamics, the obtained results presented favourable tendencies to sediment accretion near the shoreline, as well as at the inward areas for the three structures, especially for the emerged detached breakwater and for the MFAR in both wave directions. However, for the west wave direction, along the shoreline, substantial erosion was observed for both structures with more noticeable values for the emerged detached breakwater. For all the northwest wave direction scenarios, no noticeable erosion areas were visible along the shoreline. Overall, considering the balance of erosion and accretion rates, it can be concluded that for both wave predominance, the submerged detached breakwater and the MFAR presented better solutions regarding morphodynamics.The MFAR storm wave condition performed in XBeach indicated substantial erosion areas located around the structure, which added substantial changes in the bed level.",,,,,,,,,14,0,0,0,4,0,16,,,,2077-1312,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Minho, Dept Civil Engn, Campus Azurem, P-4800058 Guimaraes, PortugalUniv Coimbra, Dept Civil Engn, P-3030788 Coimbra, Portugal",,,,2020-05-15,WOS:000529415700030,,

However, the effects of small (10s m) reef structures in otherwise uniform reef areas have received little attention. Here, we assessed proximity effects of small natural and artificial vertical walls on patterns of fish assemblages, at a scale relevant to fish survey transects. We tested whether wall size affected assemblages, and whether assemblages differed between wall types. Fish assemblages were found to change in the immediate vicinity of both natural and artificial walls, with significantly higher species richness and abundance occurring at reef walls than in surrounding, flatter reef areas. The size of the effect generated by walls was found to be proportional to the size of the wall, with species richness and abundance generally increasing with wall height and length. Differences between natural and artificial walls were detected, but these were confounded by differences in size between wall types. The study builds on previous work by showing that, within reefs, local areas of higher species richness and abundance can occur in the vicinity of small but important reef features such as vertical walls. This effect introduces considerable variability into data for reef fish surveys and has implications for the design of such studies. In addition, walls appear to act as localised biodiversity hotspots'' and consideration should be given to inclusion of areas containing such features within marine reserves. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

However, a substantial portion of lionfish spawning biomass is beyond the depth limits of SCUBA. Innovative technologies may offer an alternative means to target lionfish and allow for the development of a deepwater lionfish trap fishery, but the removal efficiency and potential environmental impacts of traps have not been evaluated. We tested a collapsible non-containment trap (the Gittings trap) near artificial reefs in the northern Gulf of Mexico. A total of 327 lionfish and 28 native fishes (4 of which regulated species) recruited to traps (i.e., number of fish observed within the trap footprint) during 82 trap sets, catching 144 lionfish and 29 native species. Lionfish recruitment was highest for single (versus paired) traps deployed <15 m from reefs with a 1-day soak time, for which mean lionfish and native species recruitment per trap were approximately 5 and 0.1, respectively. Gittings traps selected for larger lionfish (mean size 277 mm total length) compared to spearfishing (mean size 258 mm). Community impacts from Gittings traps appeared minimal given recruitment patterns and catch rates were >10X higher for lionfish versus native fishes. Gittings traps did not move on the bottom during two major storm events; however, further testing will be necessary to test trap movement with surface buoys. Additional research should also focus on design and operational modifications to improve Gittings trap deployment success (68% successfully opened on the seabed) and reduce lionfish escapement (56% escaped from traps upon retrieval). While removal efficiency for lionfish (12-24%) was far below that of spearfishing, study results demonstrate Gittings traps are suitable for future testing on deepwater natural reefs, which constitute >90% of the regions reef habitat.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,University of Florida,,,,2022-11-19,PPRN:22121902,,

Overall, 30 fish were tagged and released, and 104,170 highly precise (similar to 1-3 m) spatial positions were estimated during the 43-d study. To quantify gray triggerfish movements, we used a combination of exploratory data analyses and hidden Markov models (HMM), the latter of which can identify and elucidate normally hidden behavioral states. Both methods suggested gray triggerfish movements varied by diel period and among individuals, and that some of the variation among individuals could be explained by fish size. Depending on model specification, HMMs identified two or three behavioral states, one of which was likely resting that occurred mostly at night and another was likely foraging or transit that occurred mostly during the day. Moreover, resting at night occurred in small, discrete patches within the study area, whereas foraging or transit behaviors occurred broadly throughout the study area.

Judith Pond, a tidal estuary in Southern Rhode Island. Enclosure gear was used to sample the three ecotypes, and organisms (>5 mm) were identified, enumerated, and measured to the nearest millimeter. Abundances of marine organisms and species diversity indices were used as measures of the habitat value of these ecotypes within each season. Environmental and geological parameters were not significantly different between the habitats. Emergent surface area (cm(2) m(-2) of seabed) within each ecotype was estimated, and used to evaluate its role in providing habitat. The SAG habitat had a significantly greater surface area than either the SAV or NVSB habitats during all seasons. The physical structure of the SAG habitat protects juvenile fish from predators and provides substrate for sessile invertebrates that serve as forage for fish and invertebrates. The SAG habitat supported a significantly higher abundance of organisms per m(2) of seabed throughout the year. Species richness was also significantly greater in the SAG habitat compared with the SAV and NVSB habitats. A 2-way ANOVA indicated significant differences in species diversity (Shannon-Weiner index) between habitats. Tukey's HSD test indicated that the SAG habitat had significantly higher species diversity than the NVSB habitat, but no significant difference in species diversity was found between the SAG and SAV habitats. These findings indicate that shellfish aquaculture gear provides habitat for many organisms throughout the year, and is especially beneficial to ecosystems that support native species of recreationally and commercially important fish and invertebrates in their early life history stages. Therefore, we conclude that shellfish aquaculture gear has substantially greater habitat value than a shallow nonvegetated seabed, and has habitat value at least equal to and possibly superior to submerged aquatic vegetation.",,,,,,,,,55,2,0,0,54,0,74,,,0730-8000,1943-6319,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Rhode Isl, Dept Fisheries & Aquaculture, Kingsport, RI 02881 USA",,,,2004-12-01,WOS:000226559500024,,

We examined whether assemblage differences between reef types were driven by differences in juvenile recruitment, or were related to differences in older life-stages. Assemblages on both reef types were dominated by juveniles (61% of individuals) and sub-adults (34% of individuals). Seasonal fluctuations in assemblage parameters (species richness, diversity, sub-adult abundance) were similar between reef types, and levels of species diversity and assemblage composition were generally comparable. However, abundance and species richness were consistently higher (1.9-7.6 and 1.3-2.6 times, respectively) on breakwaters. These assemblage differences could not be explained by differences in juvenile recruitment, with seasonal patterns of recruitment and juvenile species found to be similar between reef types. In contrast, abundances of sub-adults were consistently higher (1.1-12 times) at breakwaters, and assemblage differences appeared to be driven by this life-stage.

The reef rises from the seafloor, up to 3 m at the central structures and between 1 and 2 m in the outer regions. The reef units were chosen for their long life and high stability and for the creation of cavity systems and hideaways for juvenile organisms. The used concrete material was composed in a special way to reach neutral pH values, with regard to the surrounding waterbody, on the surfaces of the structures. The reef units were placed on a strong marl layer with a thin sediment layer of sand and gravel.

The case studies covered areas of seafloor ranging from 0.15 km(2) to over 1.000.000 km(2) (average of 26.600 km(2)) and a broad range of geomorphic feature types. The mean depths of the study areas ranged from 8 to 2.375 m. with about half of the studies on the shelf (depth < 120 m) and half on the slope and at greater depths. Mapping resolution ranged from 0.1 to 170 m (mean of 13 m). There is a relatively equal distribution of studies across the four naturalness categories: near pristine (n = 17), largely unmodified (n = 16), modified (n = 13), and extensively modified (n = 10). In terms of threats to habitats, most authors identified fishing (n = 46) as the most significant threat, followed by pollution (n = 12), oil and gas development (n = 7), and aggregate mining (n = 7). Anthropogenic climate change was viewed as an immediate threat to benthic habitats by only three authors (n = 3).Water depth was found to be the most useful surrogate for benthic communities in the most studies (n = 17). followed by substrate/sediment type (n = 14). acoustic backscatter (n = 12). wave-current exposure (n = 10). grain size (n = 10). seabed rugosity (n = 9). and bathymetric/topographic position index (BPI/TPI) (n = 8). Water properties (temperature. salinity) and seabed slope are less useful surrogates. Multiple analytical methods were used to identify surrogates, with ARC GIS being by far the most popular method (23 out of 44 studies that specified a methodology).Of the many purposes for mapping benthic habitats, four stand out as preeminent: (1) to support government spatial marine planning, management, and decision making; (2) to support and underpin the design of marine protected areas (MPAs); (3) to conduct scientific research programs aimed at generating knowledge of benthic ecosystems and seafloor geology; and (4) to conduct living and nonliving seabed resource assessments for economic and management purposes. Out of 57 case studies, habitat mapping was intended to be part of an ongoing monitoring program in 24 cases, whereas the mapping was considered to be a one-off exercise in 33 cases. However, out of the 33 one-off cases, the authors considered that their habitat map would form the baseline for monitoring future changes in 24 cases. This suggests that governments and regulators generally view habitat mapping as a useful means of measuring and monitoring change. In terms of the perceived clients and users of habitat maps, most authors considered industry, marine conservation, and the scientific community to be the primary users of habitat maps. However, the overwhelming majority of habitat surveys were funded by government or government-funded agencies/institutions (n = 49), with only minor funding from private industry (n = 7) or nongovernment organizations (n = 4).A gap analysis (i.e., geomorphic features and habitats not included in the case studies) illustrates that whereas shelf and slope habitats are well represented in the case studies, estuarine and deltaic coastal habitats plus deep ocean (abyssal-hadal) environments were described in only a few case studies. Geographically, about half of the case studies were from waters around Western Europe, while the margins of the continents of Africa, Asia, and South America were not represented in any case study. Given the intense pressures facing benthic habitats and broad regional differences in ecosystems, species, and habitats, future case studies from these regions should be specifically sought for future editions of the Atlas.",,,,,,,,,24,0,1,0,14,1,27,,,,,978-0-12-385141-3,,,,,,,,,"Geosci Australia, Marine & Coastal Environm Grp, Canberra, ACT, AustraliaUniv Sydney, Arendal Sch Geosci, UNEP GRID, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia",,,,2012-01-01,WOS:000322237000066,,

To effectively address this issue, we develop a decision-making procedure, that facilitates the distribution of disputed areas of specific size among heterogeneous players in a transparent and ethical way, while considering coalitional formations through coexistence. To do this, we model players' alternative strategies and payoffs within a cooperative game-theoretic framework. Depending on whether transferable utility (TU) or non-transferable utility (NTU) is the more appropriate assumption, we illustrate the use of the TU Shapley value and the Lejano's fixed point NTU Shapley value to solve for the ideal allocations. The applicability and effectiveness of the process has been tested in a case study area, the Dogger Bank Special Area of Conservation in the North Sea, which involves three totally or partially conflicting activities, i.e. fishing, nature conservation and wind farm development. The findings demonstrate that the process is capable of providing a unique, fair and equitable division of space Finally, among the two solution concepts proposed the fixed point NTU Shapley value manages to better address the heterogeneity of the players and thus to provide a more socially acceptable allocation that favours the weaker player, while demonstrating the importance of the monetary valuation attributed by each use to the area.

The construction of a 9 ha artificial reef off southern California allowed a novel opportunity to experimentally examine at a realistic scale how the physical attributes of a reef (i.e. the amount, type, orientation, and physical location of hard substrate) are correlated with the colonization and subsequent development of sessile biota in a giant kelp Macrocystis pyrifera forest. The percent cover and slope of hard substrate were significantly related to the abundance and species richness of both understory algae and sessile invertebrates. The abundance and richness of colonizing algae were significantly related to location (i.e. proximity to the nearest natural reef), while that of sessile invertebrates was not. The type of hard substrate (quarry rock vs. concrete rubble) was unrelated to the abundance and diversity of either algae or invertebrates at any time during the 5 yr study. Physical attributes collectively explained between 16 and 40% of the variation in the abundance and diversity of the benthic community, depending on the taxon and time period examined. Variations explained by physical factors were greater in the first year during initial colonization than after 5 yr, when giant kelp was fully established. The construction of the artificial reef was akin to a large disturbance that created free space. Our findings suggest that physical attributes of reef structure may play a key role in structuring reef communities following a disturbance, but their importance diminishes over time as ecological interactions involving established reef organisms become increasingly important.",,,,,,,,,19,3,0,0,18,0,25,,,0171-8630,1616-1599,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Inst Marine Sci, Santa Barbara, CA 92103 USAUniv Calif Santa Cruz, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Santa Cruz, CA 95060 USA",,,,2015-11-26,WOS:000365698900004,,

One of the purported benefits of transplantation is a positive effect of transplants on coral recruitment by sexual reproduction of transplants (seeding) and/or settlement cues generated by the presence of live coral (attraction). However, evidence for this assertion is scarce. Here, we investigated the effect of coral transplantation on larval recruitment. A total of 6,164 fragments of four coral species (acroporids and pocilloporids) were transplanted at three sites in North Sulawesi, Indonesia. Coral recruitment onto limestone settlement plates was examined every 3 months and on concrete structures at the end of the study (15months) in the presence and absence of transplants. Transplant survival after 1year ranged between 20 and 30% for pocilloporids and between 40 and 80% for acroporids. Transplantation had no consistent effect on the number of coral recruits on the settlement plates or on the concrete structures. Recruitment was relatively high compared to other locations in the region and fluctuated seasonally, with increased rates in all treatments during peaks of reproduction. We conclude that, in the presence of high background recruitment and detrimental environmental conditions, coral transplantation may not be an effective method to boost coral recruitment.

The method used both direct censuses at monthly intervals and limited fishing activity with lon,alines and trammels. The monthly census was carried out by two divers in the central part of the artificial reef made up of pyramids, each consisting of five concrete cubic blocks with 2-m sides. The census was carried out in two main phases: first the observer counted the fish moving around him for 15 min and then he explored the holes and the internal corridors. The second phase consisted of a 25-m crosswise movement between two pyramids. Observations were carried out over a period of 2 years, from February 1989 to February 1991, and 66 species of fish and invertebrates of fishing importance were caught and/or observed in the Loano artificial reef; 41 species (of which three were Crustaceans and two Cephalopods) were censused during the above-mentioned dives. The most numerous families were Sparidae and Labridae, followed by Serranidae. The predominance of the first two families seems to be one of the general characteristics of rocky sea-bed fish communities in the northwest Mediterranean. Seasonal changes in the qualitative and quantitative assemblages of fish are described. An important contribution to these changes was the appearance of juveniles, mainly in the latter half of the summer and in the autumn. It was in this period that the maximum fish density occurred, while the minimum was registered in June. The number of fishes increased with the age of the artificial reef and the evolution of macrobenthos settlement.

Islands are the coral reefs and hard-bottom (also called hard substrate) biological communities found along the course of a massive stream of ocean currents connecting the Caribbean Sea, the Gulf of Mexico, and the western Atlantic off North America. This expedition emphasizes habitat characterization and an understanding of these islands' connection as parts of an interrelated ecosystem. Though separated by large expanses of ocean water, the fishes, corals, and invertebrates common to these islands may demonstrate that the health and vitality of downstream islands are linked closely to those located upstream.From August to October 2001, scientists explored the deep reef and hard-bottom communities of the South Atlantic Bight, from the east coast of Florida through the North Carolina Shelf. Leg One of this mission, lasting from August 29 to September 7, visited the Oculina Bank, situated 30 km (18 mi) east of the northern Florida coast. Oculina Bank was the first deep-water site in federal waters off the U.S. Eastern Seaboard to be closed to fishing. Once, this area was covered with dense thickets of the ivory tree coral, Oculina varicosa, which provided excellent habitat for reef fish, such as grouper and wreckfish, and feeding grounds for migratory pelagic (deep-sea) species. However, fishing activities destroyed approximately two-thirds of the bank. A fragile and slow-growing coral, deep-water Oculina only grows about one-half inch per year. These and other damaged coral reefs will take many years, even decades, to recover. To aid in the recovery process, a significant portion of the area was closed to fishing in 1994. NOAA has since funded efforts to assess the banks and to attempt to restore the damaged areas. In July 2000, the National Marine Fisheries Service approved plans to expand the protected area, with the goal of saving the remaining ivory tree coral. Much of the protected area is deeper than 100 m (328 ft), rugged, and can only be studied using advanced undersea technologies. The mission will use the HBOI submersible Clelia and an ROV to study the recovery of the reserve. In addition to habitat characterization work, visual observations of artificial-reef restoration structures deployed on the banks beginning in 1995 will help to determine species' rates of recruitment. Scientists will also test a hydrophone array to determine its utility for monitoring grouper spawning.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2020-11-23,DRCI:DATA2020233018200511,,

This can be defined within a Drivers-Activities-Pressures-State Changes-Impacts (on human Welfare)-Responses framework. This paper considers the main decommissioning options - partial or complete removal of all components. A SWOT analysis shows environmental and economic benefits in partial as opposed to complete removal, especially if habitat created on the structures has conservation or commercial value. Benefits (and repercussions) are defined in terms of losses and gains of ecosystem services and societal benefits. The legal precedents and repercussions of both options are considered in terms of the 10-tenets of sustainable marine management. Finally a 'renewables-to-reefs' programme is proposed.

Thirteen species of scleractinian corals inhabit these structures, and a positive association is known to exist between reef-associated fishes and coral. Here, we studied 22 platforms on the Mississippi River delta, an area devoid of natural reefs. We quantified the abundance of reef-associated fishes on platforms occurring in 19-334 m depths. We recorded 18 reef-associated fish species, most commonly Stegastes leucostictus (Muller and Troschel, 1848), Stegastes partitus (Poey, 1868), Abudefduf saxatilis (Linnaeus, 1758), Abudefduf taurus (Muller and Troschel, 1848), and Chromis multilineata (Guichenot, 1853). In water depths >= 25 m, average fish densities ranged from 1.0 to 15.3 m(-2). No reef-associated fishes were observed on structures in < 25 m water depth. Individual sample densities ranged from 0 to 32 m(-2). Average fish densities peaked on the platforms at depths of 18-36 m. At > 66 m depth, the fish densities dropped to zero. Average coral densities per platform in waters > 30 m deep ranged from 0.4 to 173.0 colonies m(-2). Individual sample densities ranged from 0 to 945.0 colonies m(-2). There was a significant positive correlation between average reef-associated fish density and bottom water depth. There was also a positive correlation between average fish density and average coral density. The data indicated that coral and fish densities were lower in inshore waters. These waters are generally characterized by low salinity, low winter seawater temperatures, high turbidity, and high nutrient levels. Our data showed that the fish community is linked to the coral community, as is known to occur on natural reefs.

We present results of interannual changes in seafloor surficial geology at the Redbird artificial reef site, located on the continental shelf offshore of Delaware Bay. The Redbird reef is composed of NYC subway cars, barges, tugboats, and other sunken objects. Since objects were added sporadically between 1996 and 2009, the survey area acts as a natural laboratory to study the evolution of the surrounding seafloor at a structural reef habitat through time. Annual side-scan surveys from 2008 through 2011, and one bathymetric survey in 2010 provide information about surface geology and morphology. Local wave and current data for this time period were analyzed to determine the main morphological agents. Automated backscatter segmentation show that three bottom types dominate and that these large-scale ( > 10 m) surface sediment patterns persist from year to year. Grab samples reveal that the bottom types are silty sand with clay and sandy gravel. Clear sediment and biological patterns emerged revealing the influence of the objects on the seafloor. Comet-shaped moats of sandy gravel surround single objects and grow to form large-scale coalesced patches around groups of objects. Alignment of sediment patches suggests the periodic hydrodynamic influence of seasonal storms. The abundance and diversity of organisms increases with decreasing clay/silt content. Evidence of scour includes the removal of fine sediments, the formation of moats 1-30 m in diameter and 0.5-1 m deep around the reef objects, and the > 1 m settling of objects into the seafloor. Data suggest subway cars reached equilibrium with the environment in 6-7 years, but that larger objects or clusters of objects take a longer time to equilibrate and have farther-reaching effects. Knowledge of local wave and current climate and stratigraphy could inform decisions of object clustering and orientation to decrease scour impacts. (c) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Analyses of trace metals, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and organotins indicated significant but localised contamination of Astrolabe Reef but not of nearby Mtt Island. Three years after the grounding, PAH concentrations were greater in sediments at Astrolabe (up to 131mg kg(-1)) than at control locations, while organotins from the ship's antifouling hull paint were found exclusively in Astrolabe Reef sediments and biota. Over 80% of Astrolabe sediment samples contained tributyltin at concentrations above guideline sediment levels (>0.07mg kg(-1)). Tributyltin and its decomposition products were also recorded in sea urchins, gastropods, lobster and fishes at concentrations up to 0.2mg kg(-1). Wreck and cargo-derived metals, particularly copper, tin and zinc, were present in some Astrolabe sediment samples above Australia and New Zealand Environment and Conservation Council guideline concentrations. However, there appeared to be only limited transmission of metals through the food chain. Copper, tin and zinc were recorded at greater concentrations in Astrolabe sea urchins and gastropods compared to control specimens, while metal concentrations in other biota were comparable across impact and control sites. Despite over 3 years having passed since the Rena grounding, the data series does not show any upward or downward trends in contaminant concentrations on Astrolabe Reef.

ACCessibility for Shipping, Efficiency Advantages and Sustainability (ACCSEAS) aims to identify issues which obstruct maritime access to the North Sea, identify solutions, prototype and demonstrate these successful solutions in an e-Navigation test-bed at the North Sea regional level as 'proof-of-concept' and to develop a sustainability plan for future e-Navigation provision in the NSR and will look to inform e-Navigation initiative globally The entire process of the implementation of prototype solutions in the e-Navigation test-bed will be supported by training and simulation, so that the test-bed will have aspects of both real-world and simulated implementation. The project is part funded through the European Regional Development Fund's INTERREG IVB NSR initiative. European transport policy provides a shift to seaborne transport, using Short Sea Shipping to avoid road bottle necks to the movement of goods, services and people. This modal shift requires efficient and effective marine navigation services. The NSR, as a maritime hub, is at risk from increased shipping congestion and transport delays, safety issues and pollution/environmental risks that would inhibit the socio-economic development of the NSR. This is exacerbated by the proliferation of offshore installations (such as wind farms) for renewable energy.Globally, there is a trend towards larger bulk cargo and container carrying ships, which operate side-by-side with fishing boats and leisure craft in the same congested waters. Without the innovative services of e-Navigation, berth-to-berth operations may become less efficient. There may be increased risk of collisions and groundings, adversely impacting accessibility of ports and the effectiveness of logistics in the region. Consequences could be severe in terms of reduced economic sustainability, more environmental pollution incidents and the threat to safety-of-life.The International Maritime Organisation (IMO) concept of e-Navigation, formally recognised by the EU and the US, provides a potential solution via harmonised, integrated and exchangeable electronic maritime information on-board and ashore. The NSR, as a crossroads of regional and global shipping, is well positioned to benefit from an implementation of e-Navigation that can increase the efficient use of resources, provide better voyage planning and track-keeping and deliver improvements in regional accessibility.ACCSEAS aims to implement and demonstrate e-Navigation systems to alleviate NSR navigation risks. The aim of ACCSEAS is to identify issues which obstruct maritime access to the NSR, identify solutions, pilot and then demonstrate these successful solutions at regional level to develop a strategy for future e-Navigation provision. ACCSEAS builds on findings of previous and currently implemented related European projects and the ACCSEAS partnership includes several partners from those projects, allowing a smooth, efficient coordination between the projects and ensuring work is seamless without overlap.A regional e-Navigation service for the North Sea inherently requires a transnational approach. Improved maritime access can only be achieved by closer cooperation between competent authorities, navigation service providers and maritime stakeholders which encompasses: technology, infrastructure, services and operations within the broad policy, guidance and regulatory frame work of the European Union (EU), the International Association of Marine Aids to Navigation and Lighthouse Authorities (IALA) and IMO. ACCSEAS is a transnational project that brings together Beneficiaries (including competent navigation authorities from Denmark, Germany, Netherlands, Norway, Sweden and the United Kingdom).The North Sea presents unique challenges that will demand unique solutions both at priority locations and at the regional scale. Only through the NSR and the ACCSEAS project specifically, can the maritime administrations in the region be coordinated to address implementation of the e-Navigation solution to accessibility and to integrate with regional research providers, training organisations and suppliers.ACCSEAS produces four types of results and outputs: firstly, a practical test bed (real equipment and infrastructure in the form of e-Navigation prototypes and complementary simulations to test these); secondly, a database of information which demonstrates the effectiveness of the prototypes, primarily in the form of baseline information concerning vessel routes in the NSR and Coverage Maps of the geographical extent in the NSR of e-Navigation services for the prototypes that improve safe and efficient regional accessibility. This information will be stored within an ACCSEAS Geographical Information System (GIS); thirdly, 'system of systems engineering' documentation concerning maritime access issues in the NSR, how the e-Navigation Prototypes and Simulations were developed to address these and an assessment of best practices involved in establishing e-Navigation regional solutions; fourthly, analysis of the lessons learned, advice and training needs for practical e-Navigation solutions; with training modules developed from this analysis.By the completion of the project in 2015, the ACCSEAS Partnership will have undertaken all activities to produce validated real world prototypes and simulations (validated by test/demonstrations to satisfy user requirements) including: a ship positioning unit and terrestrial Back-up; ship-to-shore based communications; e-Navigation services on ship and shore. The project should also have put in place a structure for co-ordination of future e-Navigation development across the NSR. The structure will comprise a road map for service expansion and a plan for the sustainability and harmonisation of e-Navigation in NSR.The prototypes, systems engineering lessons and training information will advise the further extension of e-Navigation across the NSR using a sustainability plan and roadmap. The results and outputs will allow the e-Navigation Architecture developed in the NSR by ACCSEAS to be readily transferable to other EU regions and internationally. To achieve the transferability of outputs and results, ACCSEAS will disseminate information about the project to users, stakeholders, competent authorities, ports, policy and decision makers at national, regional European and International levels.",,,,,25th International Technical Meeting of the Satellite-Division of the Institute-of-Navigation25th International Technical Meeting of the Satellite-Division of the Institute-of-Navigation,"SEP 17-21, 2012SEP 17-21, 2012","Inst Nav, Satellite DivInst Nav, Satellite Div","Nashville, TNNashville, TN",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,2331-5911,2331-5954,*****************,,,,,,,,,,,,,2013-12-25,WOS:000327163303067,,

To measure perceptions of oyster reef restoration activities and priorities for future restoration along the northern Gulf of Mexico coast, a survey of 1500 individuals representing 4 user groups (oyster harvesters, shrimpers, environmental organization members, professionals), across 5 states (Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, Florida) was conducted in 2011. All respondents highly supported reef restoration efforts, but there was a dichotomy in preferred restoration goals with commercial fishermen more likely to support oyster reef restoration for stock enhancement, while professionals and environmental organization members were more likely to support oyster reef restoration to enhance ecosystem services. All user groups identified enforcement, funding, and appropriate site selection as basic requirements for successful reef restoration. For management of restored oyster reefs, oyster harvesters and shrimpers were less likely to support options that restricted the use of reefs, including gear restrictions and permanent closures, but did support rotating annual reef closures, while other stakeholders were willing to consider all options, including annual reef closures and sanctuary reefs. Overall, there were clear differences in management and communication preferences across user groups, but few differences across states. Understanding these key differences in stakeholder support for, and willingness to accept specific management actions is critical in moving management and restoration forward while minimizing conflict.

Further, aquaculture structures may increase the productivity of fish and macroinvertebrates similarly to natural complex habitats, such as seagrass beds. This research tested the general hypothesis that suspended bivalve culture increases the abundance and productivity of fish and macroinvertebrates. The study was done at two mussel farms in the Magdalen Islands, eastern Canada. Fish and macroinvertebrates were sampled in different areas within farms sites and in adjacent natural vegetated and unvegetated habitats. The instantaneous growth rates of winter flounder (Pseudopleuronectes americanus), sand shrimp (Crangon septemspinosa) and the rock crab (Cancer irroratus) were estimated using physiological indicators (RNA/DNA ratios). The results demonstrated that mussel sites are not equivalent to natural structurally complex seagrass beds with respect to fish and macroinvertebrate assemblages. Several species were abundant in mussel farms, including winter flounder and rock crab. This work, however, provided little evidence to suggest that there was greater productivity of these fish and macroinvertebrates at mussel farms, as growth rates were usually equivalent in different habitats. This study, to our knowledge, is the first attempt to determine changes in productivity brought about by aquaculture. As future development of mussel aquaculture increases in many regions around the world, the methods presented here will provide baseline information on the abundance and productivity of fish and macroinvertebrates associated with aquaculture sites.

Previous work on the marine effects of this activity is geographically incomplete, and has tended to focus on direct hydrocarbon impacts, while impacts from other related contaminants (e.g. heavy metals, salt-rich drilling muds) which may be discharged from oil facilities have not been widely assessed. Here, we examine historical trace element accumulation in marine sediments collected from four sites in the Tamaulipas shelf, Gulf of Mexico, in the area of the Arenque oil field. Dated sediment cores were used to examine the sources, and historical and contemporary inputs, of trace metals (including those typically present in oil industry discharges) and their potential biological impact in the Tamaulipas aquatic environment over the last 100 years. CaO (i.e. biogenic component) normalized data showed increasing V, Cr, Zn, Cu, Pb, Zr and Ba towards the sediment surface in three of the four cores, with Ba and V (based on an adverse effect index) possibly associated with adverse effects on organisms. Dated Ba/CaO profiles show an increase of 30-137% after opening of oil installations in the study area, and can be broadly correlated with increasing oil industry activities across the wider Gulf of Mexico. Data do not record however a clear enhancement of Ba concentration in sediment cores collected near to oil platforms over more distal cores, indicating that any Ba released from drilling platforms is incorporated quickly into the sediments around the drilling sites, and once this element has been deposited its rate of resuspension and mobility is low.Capsule abstract: Sediment core data from the Tamaulipas shelf show the influence of oil industry activities on selected trace element concentrations, with Ba/CaO broadly correlating with increasing oil industry activities across the wider Gulf of Mexico.

However, it is widely recognized that the presence of thousands of platforms in the northern Gulf of Mexico (GOM) has affected the distribution of red snapper by the addition of hard substrate habitat. We evaluated the habitat value of petroleum platforms by monitoring the fidelity of red snapper to these structures with acoustic telemetry. In May 2003, 125 red snapper were captured with hook and line at several platforms in a 35-km(2) portion of the South Timbalier oil and gas lease blocks, 50 km south of Port Fourchon, Louisiana. Following anaesthetization with MS-222, an individually coded acoustic pinger was surgically implanted into the peritoneal cavity of each specimen. After a short recovery period fish were released at five platforms in the study area. Presence of individual snapper was recorded with omnidirectional acoustic receivers attached to eight platforms. Red snapper exhibited little movement among platforms in the study area; however, logistic regression showed a high initial fidelity to release location which subsequently decreased over time. Therefore, site fidelity was estimated to be high in the short-term, but much lower in the long-term. However, study results were confounded by tag detection issues that may have resulted in long-term site fidelity being underestimated. Overall, estimates provided of red snapper fidelity to petroleum platforms should lead to more effective management of this species by adding to the knowledge of the function of platforms as habitat and their importance to the GOM red snapper population.",,,,,Symposium on Fisheries Ecology of Gulf of Mexico Red SnapperSymposium on Fisheries Ecology of Gulf of Mexico Red Snapper,"FEB 10-12, 2006FEB 10-12, 2006","Sea Grant Louisiana; NOAA; Univ West Florida; Univ S Alabama; Louisiana State Univ, Coastal Fisheries InstSea Grant Louisiana; NOAA; Univ West Florida; Univ S Alabama; Louisiana State Univ, Coastal Fisheries Inst","San Antonio, TXSan Antonio, TX",18,0,0,0,17,0,27,,,0892-2284,,978-1-888569-97-1,,,,,,,,,"Louisiana State Univ, Dept Oceanog & Coastal Sci, Baton Rouge, LA 70803 USA",,,,2007-01-01,WOS:000253386500007,,

The damage caused by ship groundings can be significant and may result in a shift in reef structure and function. In this study we evaluate the status of two restoration projects established in 1995, 6 years after two freighters, the M/V Maitland and the M/V Elpis, ran aground on reefs of the Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary. Our approach includes field monitoring in support of simulation model development to assess the effectiveness of the restoration efforts. A population model was developed for the coral Porites astreoides to project the convergence rates of coral abundance and population size structure between the restored and surrounding reference habitats. Coral communities are developing rapidly on the restoration structures. Species richness and abundance of the dominant coral, P. astreoides, were nearly indistinguishable between the restoration structures and reference habitats after only 6 years. However, although abundance and size structure of P. astreoides populations are rapidly approaching those of the reference habitats (a convergence in size structure within 10 years was simulated), maximum coral size will take twice as long to converge for this species. The sensitivity of the model to maximum recruitment rates highlights the importance of recruitment on the recovery rates of restored habitats, suggesting that special attention should be afforded to provide coral recruits with appropriate recruitment substrate at the time of restoration. Finally, the rates of convergence and, hence, the level of success of a restoration effort were shown to be influenced not only by the recruitment and survivorship rates of corals on the restoration structures but by the characteristics of the reference population as well. Accordingly, reference populations ought to be considered a moving target against which restoration success has to be measured dynamically. The simple, cost-effective, monitoring-modeling approach presented here can provide the necessary tools to assess the current status of a restoration effort and to project the time required for coral populations to resemble those found on undamaged reference habitats",,,,,,,,,36,1,0,0,29,3,44,,,1061-2971,1526-100X,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Miami, Rosenstiel Sch Marine & Atmospher Sci, Miami, FL 33149 USANOAA Fisheries, SEFSC, Miami, FL 33149 USA",,,,2003-12-01,WOS:000186531800006,,

Important components of the jetty fauna during its initial stages of development were original residents that exhibit some attraction to reef habitats, including some sand-beach inhabitants, several pelagic species and a few ubiquitous estaurine species; and reef fishes originating from permanent populations on offshore reefs. The jetties provided an artificial reef-like habitat for these species and furnished shelter and food sources on a sandy beach where such habitats were normally absent. Continued recruitment of species to the jetties consisted of occasional strays from other habitats in the area, and stragglers from more tropical areas carried into the northern gulf by currents. Reef fishes of the northern Gulf of Mexico were divided into 3 groups based upon their occurrence: common species on the offshore reefs in the northern gulf that frequently form summer populations in shallow coastal reef habitats; species also common on the offshore reefs but apparently restricted to depths greater than about 18 m and consequently not colonizing artificial reef habitats in shallow water; and typical coral reef species occurring in the northern gulf as stragglers, being carried into the area by currents (by the Eastern Gulf Loop Current from the Caribbean Sea). The only obvious successional change was the continued yearly increase in the number of species on the jetties. Seasonal changes in the fish fauna at the jetties were pronounced. A total of 204 spp. was recorded at the East Pass and St. Andrew jetties (a similar but older habitat 80 km to the east). At least 150 spp. were common to both habitats. In spite of minor differences observed between the 2 areas, the fish fauna of the East Pass jetties has apparently reached its peak in diversity and is similar to that of the St. Andrew jetties.",,,,,,,,,12,0,0,0,3,0,15,,,0071-6154,,,,,,,,,,,"DEP BIOL, RUTGERS UNIV, CAMDEN, NJ, USA",,,,1979-01-01,BCI:BCI198069070051,,

Due to the presence of these contaminants and to the lack of safe alternative uses for PG, the industry has necessarily resorted to on-site stockpiling as the primary disposal method. Thirty-three such stockpiles, totaling millions of tons of PG, are currently extant in the Gulf of Mexico region. The environmental and economic liabilities associated with PG stockpiling has prompted continuing research into alternative beneficial uses of this solid waste which will be protective of the public health. To investigate the efficacy of PG in the construction of artificial reefs, we conducted two preliminary studies which demonstrate that cement-consolidated PG may provide a suitable and safe substrate for artificial reef construction. The first, performed in the laboratory, examined the possibility of bioaccumulation of radium and six heavy metals over time when three levels (copepods, grass shrimp, and fishes) of an aquatic food chain experience both trophic and environmental exposure to PG. Other than higher radium levels in the experimental grass shrimp, little possible effect of PG exposure could be discerned. In all cases where increased metals concentrations were indicated within the experimental groups, roughly equivalent increases in metal concentrations also occurred in the control groups. The second, performed under natural conditions in four 1/4-acre estuarine ponds, evaluated the effects of PG exposure on the community structures of marine meiofauna, macroinvertebrates, and fishes. Abundances of copepod species either were slightly increased in ponds with PG or were inconsistently affected. Diversity indices for macroinvertebrates and fishes showed modest but inconsistent variation among experimental and control ponds. Thus, no differences in community structure attributable to the presence of PG could be detected among benthic invertebrates, natant invertebrates, or fishes.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1998-06-01,BCI:BCI199900213020,,

Urchin density and algal species coverage were obtained using a quadrat image analysis. Subtidal sites were then classified into three groups according to the average densities of urchins to evaluate the characterization of the macroalgal community: no urchin (NU) zone; transition (TR) zone, 4 inds. m(-2); and urchin (UR) zone, >= 8 inds. m(-2). The average urchin density in the study site was 4.7 inds. m(-2) and 57 macroalgal species were found in the study site.

Other species were not significantly correlated with urchin density. The significant correlations indicate that the abundance of some macroalgal species is proportionally regulated by sea urchin density.

J,,,,,,,,,"Deming, Timothy",,Designing sequential functionality into polypeptide side-chains to mimic complex biopolymers,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Awarded Grant,Dec 15 2019,2019,"Non-Technical Abstract The prolific adhesive capabilities of many marine organisms are well known. Each year a considerable amount of time and money is spent worldwide on the removal of barnacles from fouled vessels and other man-made structures exposed to the oceans. The adhesive proteins produced by many permanently attached marine organisms are remarkable in that they can function over wide temperature ranges, fluctuating salinity, humidity, and in the tides, waves and currents of marine environments. In contrast, the success of man-made adhesives in wet environments requires carefully cleaned surfaces which often must also be chemically treated and/or partially dried. Marine adhesives have also been explored for use as tissue glues in surgery and in dentistry, yet they are expensive to produce and can cause immune reactions. This project will develop simplified mimics of marine adhesives to identify the key components and processes require for the design and synthesis of superior adhesives for wet environments. The concepts developed in this proposal have potential to be further utilized to prepare degradable, synthetic polypeptide materials for downstream wet adhesion applications in areas such as medicine and dentistry. This funding will also be used to recruit and train women and underrepresented minority students in chemistry and materials research to contribute strongly to the STEM workforce. Technical Abstract The performance and complexity of the proteins that are key polymeric components in marine mussel adhesives have received considerable attention in the past few decades. In addition to substantial efforts to study and decipher the biological processes, there has also been much effort to replicate mussel adhesive proteins (MAPs) using synthetic polymers. Synthetic polymers for wet adhesive applications offer potential advantages over biologically sourced proteins in terms of scalable production at low cost, absence of biological contaminants, and in some cases, improved properties for applications in medicine or industry. Many of these polymers have focused primarily on mimicking the 3,4-dehydroxyphenyl-L-alanine content of mussel proteins, but have paid less attention to many other functional groups and features of MAPs, such as hydrophobic and charged groups, as well as physical and chemical changes resulting from shifts in solution pH and redox potential. Although some efforts have attempted to mimic most if not all of these features in synthetic polymers, this remains a challenging problem, especially with respect to retaining amino acid sequence information and compositional uniformity. In this project, a new approach is proposed to address this challenge by mimicking MAP sequence information using uniform side-chain peptide sequences attached to homopolypeptide scaffolds designed to contain additional biomimetic functionality. The proposed studies aim to increase the level of functional sophistication in synthetic polymers closer toward true mimicry of the complexity found in multifunctional proteins. Knowledge gained from these studies will also yield scalable synthetic methods and design rules that can be applied to mimicry of other sequence specific protein materials. Outreach objectives in this proposal will continue current efforts developed by the PI in previous NSF-funded broader impacts in preparing women and underrepresented minority students for the STEM workforce. This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,1904431,,,,,,,,University of California-Los Angeles,,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:15123517,,

This microcosm study describes the effects of oiled artificial marine snow on benthic macroinvertebrates. Corophium volutator survival was reduced by 80% in oil-contaminated snow. Hydrobia ulvae survival was reduced by 40% in oil-contaminated snow, possibly due to consumption of oiled snow. Macoma baithica was sensitive to marine snow, addition of oil slightly decreased survival. This study reveals trait-dependent sensitivity to oil with or without marine snow. The main drivers for organismal response to marine snow and oil are motility, sensitivity to hypoxia and oil toxicity, and feeding habits.

This is despite the fact that minority habitat formers can provide critical complexity, food, and other services that underpin ecosystem biodiversity. Octocorals and anemones are found in marine and estuarine habitats across all climate zones. Despite their potentially important ecological roles, to date there have been few studies of their specific threats and stressors or attempts at their restoration. Here we review studies of the ecology of octocorals and anemones with a focus on threats and restoration. We identify many threats including habitat damage, collection and trade, disease, predation, pollution, and the most widespread - climate change. While evidence suggests that some octocorals and anemone populations may be more resilient to disturbances than stony corals because they often recruit and grow quickly, resilience is not guaranteed. Instead, resilience or susceptibility within this large group is likely to be site and species specific. We find that the loss of octocorals and anemones has been difficult to quantify as most species have no hard structures that remain following a mortality event. Only through long-term monitoring efforts have researchers been able to document change in these populations. Due to the increasing extent and severity of human impacts in marine ecosystems, restoration of habitat forming species is becoming increasingly necessary after disturbance events. To illustrate the challenges ahead for octocoral and anemone restoration, we present two examples of ongoing restoration efforts assessed against the International Standards for the Practice of Ecological Restoration. Restoration planning and implementation progress are documented for the Mediterranean red coral Corallium rubrum and the temperate Australian cauliflower soft coral, Dendronephthya australis. This review and the detailed case studies demonstrate that while some octocorals and anemones can provide resilient habitat within reef systems, a greater research focus on their ecology, threats, and restoration potential is urgently required.",,,,,,,,,14,0,0,0,13,0,14,,,,2296-7745,,,,,,,,,,"Univ New South Wales, Fac Sci Evolut & Ecol, Res Ctr, Sch Biol Earth & Environm Sci, Sydney, NSW, AustraliaMacquarie Univ, Dept Earth & Environm Sci, Sydney, NSW, Australia",,,,2020-08-04,WOS:000551424800001,,
J,,,,,,,,,Elizabeth Cross,,Predictive Modelling in Complex Uncertain Environments: Optimised exploitation of physics and data,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Awarded Grant,Jun 28 2018,2018,"This project aims to improve the current techniques used to assess the condition and safety of offshore and aerospace structures. The platforms used by the Oil and Gas industry in the North Sea were designed to operate for around 25 years in total. Over 600 of these platforms have now reached the end of their design life and the decision must be taken as to whether they can continue to be used safely or whether they should be decommissioned. For new offshore wind turbines, it is critical to have a good understanding of current structural condition so that maintenance can be planned optimally - unscheduled maintenance and downtime is extremely costly, owing to the difficulty of accessing these structures. Equally, in the aerospace industry, the ability to follow a condition-based maintenance strategy will save much time and money in avoiding unscheduled/emergency repair work. This project brings together researchers from the University of Sheffield, who are experts in Structural Health Monitoring and nonlinear system modelling, with industry experts who are leading the way in the monitoring and assessment of offshore and aerospace structures. The aim of this collaboration is to develop the most accurate means possible of assessing structural condition using monitoring data. The approach that will be taken here will combine the latest developments in artificial intelligence with more traditional methods that exploit understanding of the physics at work. Predictive models based on well-understood physics can often fall short of being able to explain complex behaviour, such as the loading an offshore structure will experience in a changing sea-state. This is where learning from measured data can be used to augment the model and improve prediction at times when the physics doesn't explain the behaviour captured by the sensors. The combination of physics and data-based models will be used to improve the prediction of the forcing a structure experiences from a changing environment. An accurate quantification of this enables one to calculate the stresses a structure has undergone, which leads to a prediction of its current condition. A similar modelling approach will be used to help make predictions about the structure itself. Finally, as well as improving the accuracy of the methods used to assess structural condition, the project aims to quantify the amount of uncertainty inherent in the models and algorithms that will be implemented. This approach acknowledges the fact that it is not always possible to make an accurate prediction of structural condition at a given time, but allows a confidence level to be assigned to each assessment made. To make responsible and optimal decisions concerning the repair or decommission of a structure, understanding the level of confidence one has in an assessment of structural condition is absolutely key.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,EP/S001565/1,,,,,,,,University of Sheffield,,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:15350181,,

In the vicinity of drilling rigs used by the oil and gas industry, the concentration of particulate matter in the water column may at times be enriched as a result of the discharge of 'drill cuttings' - drilling waste material. This investigation exposed laboratory produced phytoplankton aggregates to drill cuttings of various composition (those containing no hydrocarbons from reservoir rocks and those with a <1% hydrocarbon content) and assessed the change in aggregate size, settling rate and resuspension behavior of these using resuspension chambers and settling cylinders. Results indicate that both settling velocity and seabed stress required to resuspend the aggregates are greater in aggregates exposed to drill cuttings, with these increases most significant in aggregates exposed to hydrocarbon containing drill cuttings.

This study evaluated fish usage of a limestone cobble mimic oyster reef in Barataria Bay, Louisiana, as compared to a mud-bottom reference site. Emphasis was given to species of economic and ecological importance, including spotted seatrout (Cynoscion nebulosus), Atlantic croaker (Micropogonias undulatus), and bay anchovy (Anchoa mitchilli). There were no observed differences in community structure or catch per unit effort (CPUE) between habitats, likely due to high variability in the data, though seasonal differences were observed. CPUE of spotted seatrout, Atlantic croaker, and bay anchovy did not differ between habitats. Seasonal differences in abundance were detected, with significantly higher CPUE of spotted seatrout in summer, of Atlantic croaker in spring and summer, and of bay anchovy in winter. Spotted seatrout and Atlantic croaker were both significantly larger over the artificial reef, while bay anchovy were significantly larger over the mud bottom. Spotted seatrout, a prized recreational fishing species in Louisiana, appeared to be the only species that showed higher biomass, determined by numbers and size, at the the artificial reef. This is important in the context of managing habitat enhancement projects. While the reef did not increase numbers or species richness of the overall fish community, it did have an effect on one recreationally important species.

Feeding stimulus did not seem to explain the picking behavior of stone bream and rudderfish to a lustrous black plate. Stone bream were observed fighting for territory on the black plate, and the picking behavior seemed to be territorialism. In the case of rudderfish, the picking behavior to a lustrous black plate could be explained by a schooling behavior.

No quantitative historical benthos data are available for the period prior to commencement of the fishery, although limited qualitative data exist. Therefore, studies of medium to long-term effects involved sampling the fauna of areas around wrecks (i.e., unfished pseudo-control sites) for comparison with fished grounds. Attempts were made to calculate the short, medium, and long-term impact of the fishery on the benthos and surrounding environment. Direct (short-term) effects were not quantifiable at a heavily fished offshore site (75 m depth); however, some changes were visible in a less fished, shallow (35 m depth) site. Medium to long-term effects were more discernible at the offshore site. Only minor changes were observed at the inshore location, suggesting that it is fishing intensity pei se, rather than the direct impact from passage of the gear, that constitutes the major factor controlling long-term negative trends in the benthos of the Irish Sea Nephrops grounds.

While all life stages of tiger sharks are known to occur in the Gulf of Mexico (GoM), variability in habitat use and movement patterns over ontogeny have never been quantified in this large marine ecosystem. To address this data gap we fitted 56 tiger sharks with Smart Position and Temperature transmitting tags between 2010 and 2018 and examined seasonal and spatial distribution patterns across the GoM. Additionally, we analyzed overlap of core habitats (i.e., 50% kernel density estimates) among individuals relative to large benthic features (oil and gas platforms, natural banks, bathymetric breaks). Our analyses revealed significant ontogenetic and seasonal differences in distribution patterns as well as across-shelf (i.e., regional) and sex-linked variability in movement rates. Presumably sub-adult and adult sharks achieved significantly higher movement rates and used off-shelf deeper habitats at greater proportions than juvenile sharks, particularly during the fall and winter seasons. Further, female maximum rate of movement was higher than males when accounting for size. Additionally, we found evidence of core regions encompassing the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration designated Habitat Areas of Particular Concern (i.e., shelf-edge banks) during cooler months, particularly by females, as well as 2,504 oil and gas platforms. These data provide a baseline for future assessments of environmental impacts, such as climate variability or oil spills, on tiger shark movements and distribution in the region. Future research may benefit from combining alternative tracking tools, such as acoustic telemetry and genetic approaches, which can facilitate long-term assessment of the species' movement dynamics and better elucidate the ecological significance of the core habitats identified here.",,,,,,,,,22,0,0,0,18,0,26,,,1932-6203,,,,,,,,,,,"Florida Atlantic Univ, Harbor Branch, Oceanog Inst, Ft Pierce, FL 34946 USAMississippi State Univ, Coastal Res & Extens Ctr, Biloxi, MS USAMississippi Alabama Sea Grant, Ocean Springs, MS USAUniv Miami, Rosenstiel Sch Marine & Atmospher Sci, Causeway, Miami, FL 33149 USAUniv Miami, Abess Ctr Ecosyst Sci & Policy, Miami, FL USATexas A&M Univ, Dept Marine Biol, Galveston, TX 77553 USATexas A&M Univ, Dept Wildlife & Fisheries Sci, College Stn, TX 77843 USAMississippi State Univ, Quantitat Ecol & Spatial Technol Lab, Mississippi State, MS 39762 USAMississippi State Univ, Dept Wildlife Fisheries & Aquaculture, Mississippi State, MS 39762 USALouisiana Dept Wildlife & Fisheries, New Orleans, LA USANOAA, Fisheries Southeast Fisheries Sci Ctr, Mississippi Labs, Pascagoula, MS USAOCEARCH, Park City, UT USATexas A&M Univ Corpus Christi, Harte Res Inst Gulf Mexico Studies, Corpus Christi, TX USA",Mississippi Alabama Sea GrantUniv MiamiLouisiana Dept Wildlife & FisheriesOCEARCH,,,2020-09-01,WOS:000560402000005,32667920,

Location: Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) of Brazil, Southwest Atlantic Ocean Methods: We developed a prioritisation approach to protecting different habitat types, threatened species ranges, and ecological connectivity, while also mitigating the impacts of multiple threats on biodiversity. When identifying priorities for conservation, we accounted for the co-occurrence of 24 human threats and the distribution of 161 marine habitats and 143 threatened species, as well as their associated vulnerabilities. Additionally, we compared our conservation priorities with MPAs proposed by local stakeholders. Results: We show that impacts to habitats and species are widespread and identify hotspots of cumulative impacts on inshore and offshore areas. Industrial fisheries, climate change, and land-based activities were the most severe threats to biodiversity. The highest priorities were mostly found towards the coast due to the high cumulative impacts found in nearshore areas. As expected, our systematic approach showed a better performance on selecting priority sites when compared to the MPAs proposed by local stakeholders without a typical conservation planning exercise, increasing the existing coverage of MPAs by only 7.9%. However, we found that proposed MPAs still provide some opportunities to protect areas facing high levels of threats. Main conclusions: The study presents a blueprint of how to embrace a comprehensive ecological approach when identifying strategic priorities for conservation. We advocate protecting these crucial areas from degradation in emerging conservation efforts is key to maintain their biodiversity value. Habitat Data WeWe conceptualised a GIS-based habitat map (also often labelled ecosystems) at a national scale by assembling data from peer-reviewed literature, publicly-available and unpublished datasets, governmental and nongovernmental reports, and performed complementary GIS analysis. We developed a hierarchical classification scheme that accomplished a fine delineation of benthic habitats throughout Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) of Brazil and resulted in 161 distinct and non-overlapping classes of habitat types. Recognising the spatial structure of the marine environment, we developed separate pelagic (N=11) and benthic habitats (N=150) to account for different types and resolution of available data. The benthic habitats were delineated following a nested hierarchical classification scheme as a result of specific combinations of ecoregions (sensu Spalding et al. 2007), depth zones, seascape units (delineation of the seabed into hard, soft, or mixed substrate types), and within-habitat specificities (in places where more detailed data were available). Whenever possible, we obtained digital maps containing the extension of marine habitats (e.g., nearshore banks of coral reefs); however, some spatial data were manually digitised and inserted in the GIS (e.g., seagrass meadows). We assigned unique code identifiers, names, and descriptions to the marine habitats (Table S1 of the paper). We used expert opinion within the authors to revise the draft habitats produced by the analytic steps described in Supporting Information of the paper. The level-1 habitats comprised eight ecoregions (1. Amazon; 2. Northeastern; 3. Eastern; 4. Fernando de Noronha and Atoll das Rocas; 5. Sao Pedro and Sao Paulo Islands; 6. Trindade and Martin Vaz Islands; 7. Southeastern Brazil; and 8. Rio Grande), from costal to abyssal environments. The level-2 habitats provided a sub-delineation of the level-1 habitats following a depth-related differentiation in habitat distribution defined by geophysical constraints (Last et al., 2010), which resulted in six depth zones: coastal shelf (< 25 m), mid shelf (25-75 m), outer shelf (75-200 m), upper slope (200-700 m), lower slope (700-2,000 m), and abyss (>2,000 m). The level-3 habitats provided a further partition of the previous habitats and were based on mappable structures, which are of conservation interest, defined by habitat forming species or geomorphological structures, and assumed to be surrogates for distinctive biological assemblages. The seascape units were delimited by convenient boundaries and included: (i) beaches/sand dunes; (ii) Bryozoa reefs; (iii) canyons; (iv) cold-water reefs (based on the occurrence of deep-sea reef-constructing corals Lophelia pertusa, Solenosmilia variabilis, Enallopsammia rostrate, and Madrepora oculata); (v) estuaries; (vi) Halimeda reefs; (vii) kelps; (viii) mesophotic reefs; (ix) rhodolith beds; (x) seagrass meadows; (xi) shallow-water coral reefs; (xii) shallow-water rocky reefs; (xiii) mangroves; (xiv) seamounts; (xv) Bryozoan reefs ; and (xvi) submarine fan deltas. The pelagic habitats were classified based on a cluster analysis of ecological data that serve as surrogates for assemblages of pelagic species. For pelagic habitats, we acquired environmental parameters from open-access sources (Bio-ORACLE v2.0; (Assis et al., 2018) for the top surface layer of the ocean (2000-2014), including salinity (mean), sea surface temperature (mean, min, max), dissolved molecular oxygen (mean), chlorophyll a (mean), and nutrients (nitrate, phosphate, and silicate; mean). We downloaded the images into ArcGIS 10.1 (ESRI, 2011) and all raster datasets were projected to an Albers equal-area projection with metre measurement units. With every pixel in the study area characterized by all parameters, we used a cluster analysis to understand the distinctive habitats with within the study area. We used the hierarchical Iso Cluster Unsupervised Classification tool in ArcGIS to define pelagic habitats. We used default settings for all parameters.Descriptions of each physical environmental characteristics underpinning each pelagic habitat are summarized in Table S2. Threatened species We obtained species distribution ranges and assessment of identified threats available for 143 animal species (invertebrates, fishes, mammals, turtles, and seabirds) listed under national legislation with a status of Critically Endangered, Endangered, or Vulnerable. Range maps for all species were obtained from shapefiles downloaded from the National Red List of Threatened Species spatial data repository (i.e., the national agency for biodiversity conservation, ICMBio), the literature, and the Aquamaps dataset (Kesner-Reyes, K. Kaschner, Kullander, Garilao, Barile, & Froese, 2016). The spatial data were processed by constraining them to the geographic distribution within the appropriate depth ranges for each species according to the text information in each species assessment. Following established practice, for wide-ranging (i.e., > 20,000 km2) mammals, seabirds, and turtles, distribution maps corresponded to key areas for species conservation (breeding, foraging, calving or nursery areas) rather than encompassing large portions of habitats discontinuities (e.g., whale migration routes). However, spatial distribution data of breeding, foraging, or nursery grounds for fishes and invertebrates with large range extents were not available at the national scale; thus, the geographic distribution of the species within these groups was delimited using occurrence records and reported depth ranges. We checked for the quality of all distribution data for each species when more than one data provider was identified. We are confident this represents the best available database on the distribution of threatened marine species in Brazil. Spatial data on threats Industrial fishing information consisted of vessel monitoring systems (VMS) data from 10 fisheries and associated gear types that are monitored within Brazilian waters by government agencies (Programa nacional de rastreamento das embarcacoes pesqueiras por satelite - PREPS). We estimated the density of points (fishing operations) for each gear type separately over a period of three years (2015-2017). For this analysis, we obtained a total of 4,205,607 data points representing signals produced from 905 vessels in fishing operations. We created a layer for each gear type by dividing the number of signals in each raster cell of 1 km2 by the total number of signals emitted by all vessels operating that specific gear type. This produced our map of relative threats for each gear type. For global warming, we used the 4-km Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) Version 5.0 sea surface temperature (SST) data produced by NOAAs National Oceanographic Data Center spanning the time period (1985-2009) to calculate rate of warming using non-linear mixed effect models (package nlme in R) as described by (Magris, Heron, & Pressey, 2015). SST data were composited to monthly resolution (from weekly) for calculation of trends. Information on ultraviolet (UV) radiation, ocean acidification, shipping lanes, and invasive species were obtained from global, publicly available datasets (Halpern et al., 2012, 2008). The coastal development index was calculated as described by (Aubrecht et al., 2008), whose index was measured by distance from emission of night-time lights, a proxy for human settlement and urbanisation. Night-time satellite imagery was obtained by NOAA's National Geophysical Data Center (NGDC). We chose a 25 km radius as a reasonable distance from a source of high night light at which many key human impacts from coastal development (e.g. domestic housing and presence of engineering structures) might affect the marine environment. Information on mining (i.e. geographic areas of active or exploratory mines [N=564]) and oil/gas fields (i.e. geographic areas either licensed for exploration [N=2,242] or production [N=670]) were provided by the Brazilian Ministry of Mines and Energy. Ports information were obtained from data provided by the Brazilian Environmental Agency. We estimated port-derived pollution by digitizing the areas of direct influence of each port (N=64), which included port infrastructure areas, dredging and disposal sites. We evaluated the threats derived from land-based activities considering four main layers: i) sediment, ii) organic pollution, iii) fertilisers, and iv) pesticides. To determine the influence of sediment in coastal waters, we first identified a sediment settling rate in function of depth x. For that, we adapted the methods used by Doheny et al. (2013) and Halpern et al. (2008). First, we assumed a settling velocity of 0.0001 ms-1 for silt and clay and that this rate decreases in waters less than 10 m deep: This helped us to map the maximum plume extent possible considering the settling rates of fine sediments (i.e. silt and clay). Second, we used the Path Distance tool in ArcMap 10.7(ESRI, 2011) to determine the sediment travel time within the coastal waters based on the river mouth point locations and surface currents from the eddy-resolving 1/12° global HYCOM (Hybrid Coordinate Ocean Model) (Mehra & Rivin, 2010). We acquired oceanographic model data using the Marine Geospatial Ecology Tools software package (Roberts, Best, Dunn, Treml, & Halpin, 2010). Third, we used the Raster Calculator tool in Arcmap 10.7 (ESRI, 2011) to identify the pixels where sediment is still in suspension (i.e. positive values) using the following equation: Finally, sediment loading within the plume was estimated using an exponential distance-decay function of 0.0001 in Arcmap 10.7 (ESRI, 2011). For organic pollution, we used data from the Brazilian National Water Agency (Agencia Nacional das Aguas, 2018) on the amount of diluted non-treated sewer discharge per coastal council. In this case, we assumed that most of the pollution comes from urban runoff and that some coastal councils release their sewer directly in the ocean. For that, we considered that the amount of diluted non-treated sewer multiplied by population size (IBGE, 2015) would spread within a buffer of 5 km from each council coastal zone. We used the Cost-Path Surface tool in Arcmap 10.7 (ESRI, 2011) with a decay function of 0.05 (i.e. assuming a fixed amount of the threat in the initial cell and then evenly distributed to the remaining cells within the buffer area). Data for the usage of fertilisers in different cropping systems were extracted from the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (Instituto Brasileiro de Geografia e Estatistica (IBGE)., 2015), which included the amount of fertilisers used per cultivated area (kg ha-1) and the total area cultivated for each cropping system in each Brazilian State. We followed a similar approach to create the layer for pesticides. In this case, we extracted information on the average usage per ha (litres ha-1) and area used for different cropping systems (ha) from (Pignati et al., 2017). In both cases, we aggregated the data by catchment (i.e. 32 coastal catchments) and distributed to pour points (i.e. 302 river mouths) for each catchment. Then, we estimated the spread of fertilisers and pesticides into coastal waters by using the Cost-Path Surface tool in Arcmap 10.7 (ESRI, 2011) considering a 5 km buffer from each pour point and a decay function of 0.05. After creating these four layers, we have standardised their values between 0 and 1 using the equation below: Mining sites, oil/gas fields, port locations and associated dredging and disposal sites were treated as binary data (present or absent in any 1 km2 raster cell) for our analyses since there are no data on the relative severity of individual areas. Other threat layers were normalised to range between zero and one, where one reflected the maximum value across all raster cells throughout study region for each layer and zero indicated the minimum value of threat. This normalisation made it possible to compare all threat layers. Cumulative impact map Estimates of cumulative impact were calculated as described by Halpern et al. (2008) and consisted of three components: (i) spatial distribution of each marine habitat; (ii) spatial distribution of each threat; and (iii) sensitivity weights to convert each threat to its relative impact on each of the habitats. We summarised the occurrence of all threat layers within each planning unit containing varying extents of each habitat throughout their distribution. We incorporated the sensitivity of each habitat to each threat (i.e., vulnerability) following the framework developed by Halpern, Selkoe, Micheli, & Kappel (2007), based on expert judgment. Where there was an overlap, we multiplied each threat layer with each habitat layer, and then multiplied each combination by the corresponding weight variable representing a relative vulnerability of that habitat to each overlapping threat. This means that the presence of a threat and a habitat in the same planning unit is not considered an impact unless the given habitat is known to be sensitive to that threat (Tables S3 and S4). We link the habitats and threats developed here to the ones presented by Halpern et al., 2007 to assign the weight values (Table S5).

Essentially, the choices are either the continuous degradation of the reefs or active restoration to encourage reef development. As a result, worldwide restoration operations during the past decade have been recognized as being a major tool for reef rehabilitation. This situation has also stirred discussions and debates on the various restoration measures suggested as management options, supplementary to the traditional conservation acts, The present essay reviews past decade's (1994-2004) approaches and advances in coral reef restoration. While direct coral transplantation is still the primer vehicle of operations used, the concept of in situ and ex situ coral nurseries (the gardening concept), where coral materials (nubbins, branches, spats) are maricultured to a size suitable for transplantation, has been gaining recognition. The use of nubbins (down to the size of a single or few polyps) has been suggested and employed as a unique technique for mass production of coral colonies. Restoration of ship grounding sites and the use of artificial reefs have become common tools for specific restoration needs. Substrate stabilization, 3-D structural consideration of developing colonies, and the use of molecular/biochemical tools are part of novel technology approaches developed in the past decade. Economic considerations for reef restoration have become an important avenue for evaluating success of restoration activities. It has been suggested that landscape restoration and restoration genetics are important issues to be studied. In the future, as coral reef restoration may become the dominant conservation act, there would be the need not only to develop improved protocols but also to define the conceptual bases.",,,,,,,,,233,12,0,0,188,10,272,,,0013-936X,1520-5851,,,,,,,,,,"Natl Inst Oceanog, Isreal Oceanog & Limnol Res, IL-31080 Haifa, Israel",,,,2005-06-15,WOS:000229724100007,16047765,

The reef group consisted of four sets, each comprised of three modules or units. Holes (15, 20 and 25 cm diam) were cut into the sides of the modules to evaluate the effect of hole size as well as reef height on the fish assemblage. The point-count, visual census method (5 min, 100 m(2)) using video/audio was employed to record the dependent variables: number of species, number of individuals, species diversity (H'), and biomass (calculated from total length estimates). During the 13-month survey from October 1987 through October 1988, 31 species were recorded, 20 of which were found during more than 1 month. Most species were apparently derived from the offshore reef fish community. Few estuarine species were associated with the reef. The dependent variables showed both seasonal and colonization features. While the other variables declined with temperature, biomass remained high after the summer influx of species and individuals. Stepwise regression and ANOVA analyses indicated that temperature was the dominant factor associated with variation in the dependent variables. Time of day and tide also had an impact on some variables. Reef specific attributes (i.e., orientation, height, and hole size) had no relationship to the fish assemblage. A DCA analysis exhibited both seasonal and colonization effects and also indicated that the assemblage was dependent on temperature. Four meaningful clusters were formed at level two in a TWINSPAN analysis; the species associations were based on ecological features of the species.

Disturbed benthic and associated fish assemblages may take years-decades to return to pre-impact levels or may attain alternate stable states. Rose Atoll, a small, remote coral atoll in the central South Pacific, was impacted by a major ship grounding and associated contaminant spill in October 1993. Coral reef fish assemblages were quantitatively surveyed at the site of impact and compared to other nearby sites along the western outer reef slope in August 1995, February 2002, February 2004, and March 2006. In 1995, herbivorous surgeonfishes dominated the site, likely attracted to the early algal blooms. During 2002-2006, both numbers and biomass of pooled herbivorous fishes were significantly greater at the wreck site than at the other reef-slope survey sites. This greater abundance, where some corroding steel debris remained, was associated with significantly greater substratum cover by opportunistic algae (both turf and cyanobacteria). Thus, more than 13 yrs later, the grounding of this ship is still impacting algal growth and herbivorous reef-fish populations. While continued ecosystem monitoring at Rose Atoll is necessary for a full understanding of recovery rates by fish assemblages from such major anthropogenic disturbances, in the event of future groundings, containment of the contaminant spill and prompt removal of all metallic debris is recommended to preserve ecosystem integrity.",,,,,,,,,29,0,0,0,27,2,36,,,0007-4977,,,,,,,,,,,"NOAA, Joint Inst Marine & Atmospher Res, Honolulu, HI 96814 USANOAA, Pacif Isl Fisheries Sci Ctr, Coral Reef Ecosyst Div, Honolulu, HI 96814 USANature Conservancy, Woolloongabba, Qld 4102, AustraliaNOAA, Pacific Isl Fisheries Sci Ctr, Aiea Heights Res Facil, Aiea, HI 96701 USA",Nature Conservancy,,,2008-05-01,WOS:000256901600006,,

Although China has decades of experience in developing MPAs, its current MPA designs are limited to small spatial scales and are infrequently supported by a systematic planning approach. As one of few studies to incorporate biological and socio-economic information in marine conservation prioritization in China, this study, targeting Haizhou Bay in China, provides a range of MPA network alternatives and evaluates the current design for four scenarios with different objectives. This corresponds to the major challenges for China's MPAs: conserve biodiversity; protect ecologically and economically important species; minimize socio-economic costs; and reduce enforcement costs. Furthermore, this study considers the compatibility of aquaculture practices, economically critical to China's coastal regions, in MPA designs and implementations. This study determines that current MPA designs are inadequate to meet conservation objectives. For instance, existing MPAs cover less than 10% of the ranges of target species for conservation. There are substantial conservation gaps offshore. By constructing and analysing planning scenarios, this study demonstrates the trade-offs in objectives as well as the importance of implementing SCP in China's MPA network design.

Morphological analyses of these specimens show that there are three distinct lineages of Tubastraea that have remained cryptic due to similar morphology in the field: Tubastraea coccinea (Lesson, 1829), T. tagusensis, and a third clade containing a mix of characters of the former two. These results based on morphology are corroborated by phylogenetic and haplotype analyses using a partial sequence of the mitochondrial genes ATP8 and cytochrome oxidase I (mtCOI). The negative effects on natural habitats by invasive species of Tubastraea have been documented worldwide.

The video camera was evaluated in a series of lab-based trials to establish performance parameters (power consumption, data accumulation rates and maximum continuous recording time). The system performed reliably with a mean maximum continuous recording time of 13.3 (+/- 0.3) h. Field trials were carried out to (a) compare results of video parameters, number of species identified (Nsp), maximum number of each species (MaxN) and time at first appearance of each species (TFAP) to a conventional standard definition video system and (b) examine the effect that a reduction in image resolution has on these parameters. Results indicated no significant differences between the standard definition camera and the test system at the highest resolution stetting (640 x 480). However, the total number of species identified by the reader was significantly less at the low resolution setting (176 x 144) and a significant reduction in relative abundance (MaxN) and TFAP were identified for both the mid (320 x 240) and lowest resolution (176 x 144) settings. Results indicate the solid state camera system is useful for extending recording time above that of standard definition cameras. However, there is limited potential to extend deployment times of BRUV systems via a reduction in video resolution without significant compromises to the accuracy and precision of the key indicators for diversity and abundance of fishes.

Arctic regions are projected to strongly manifest impacts of an altered climate and subsurface moored continuous observations are essential for understanding time-dependent marine processes that are likely to change in unanticipated ways. However, autonomous observations in this cold, ice-covered, and corrosive environment are difficult operations. Since 2014, the moored Chukchi Ecosystem Observatory (CEO) has been located in 45 m of water on the southern flank of Hanna Shoal just a few kilometers south of the marine protected area boundary. Concurrent measurements include physical, nutrient and carbonate chemistry, particulate, phytoplankton, zooplankton, fisheries, and marine mammal data sets. These measurements provide a unique multi-disciplinary view into the mechanistic workings of the Chukchi shelf ecosystem. Ship-based programs including the Arctic Marine Biodiversity Observation Network (AMBON) and the Distributed Biological Observatory (DBO) place the CEO within a broader spatial context of observations and provide vessel support for mooring recoveries and deployments, as well as visual marine mammal and marine bird surveys and both water column and benthic biological measurements. In turn, the CEO helps anchor the AMBON and DBO data in time with long duration and high temporal resolution sampling.The technology and the collaborative approach associated with AMBON, the CEO, and the DBO are leading to sustained observations that are expanding our ability to understand seasonality of physical, biochemical, and biological processes on Arctic shelves. These sustained observations are examining processes that contribute to short (seconds) and long (years) time scale variations, and the reasons that Hanna Shoal is of particular importance to walrus and other wildlife. Together, these programs' observations reveal consequences of wind and wave activity on ocean currents and water column hydrography, the annual cycle of nutrient draw-down and replenishment, the timing and composition of particulate matter settling, the status of lower trophic level biological communities, marine mammal activity, the distribution of ice keels, and the timing and location of fish and macrozooplankton in the water column. Such measurements are helping guide a better understanding of the ecological functioning of the biologically-rich Hanna Shoal region.",,,,,Conference on OCEANSConference on OCEANS,"SEP 18-21, 2017SEP 18-21, 2017",,"Anchorage, AKAnchorage, AK",6,0,0,0,4,0,7,,,0197-7385,,*****************,,,,,,,,,"Univ Alaska Fairbanks, Fairbanks, AK 99775 USAUniv Laval, Quebec City, PQ, CanadaUniv Maryland, Ctr Environm Sci, Solomons, MD USAUniv Washington, Seattle, WA 98195 USA",,,,2017-01-01,WOS:000455012000337,,

We tested this predation mechanism with a series of field experiments at two sites (inner-bay sand-seagrass flat, and outer-bay seagrass bed adjacent to coral reefs) in Bahia de la Ascension, Mexico. We examined survival of two size-classes of juvenile Caribbean spiny lobster Panulirus argus tethered in seagrass beds with and without access to artificial lobster shelters, and at different distances from the shelters. The artificial shelters were concrete structures (casitas) that simulate lobster dens. Large juvenile lobsters (56-65 mm CL) attained a relative size refuge when tethered 60 m away from casitas compared with smaller (46-55 mm CL) lobsters. Conversely, the small lobsters survived better beneath casitas than did large lobsters. Small juveniles also survived better at casitas or 30 m away from casitas than at 15 m or 70 m away. Observations indicated that the day-time predator guild, composed primarily of snappers (family Lutjanidae), seldom foraged more than 60 m from casitas and were typically within 15 m of casitas. There was also a significant positive correlation between predation-induced lobster mortality and numbers of snapper associated with casitas at the inner-bay site. Thus, tethering lobsters 70 m away from casitas appeared adequate to examine survival of lobsters in an environment uninfluenced by daytime predators aggregating to casitas. These results indicate that (1) the relative importance of a lobster-size refuge from predators varies according to shelter availability, and (2) that there is a nonlinear relationship between predation risk and distance from an artificial shelter. Our results demonstrate that casitas increase survival of small juvenile lobsters but reduce survival of larger juveniles. Small casitas scaled according to body size may enhance survival of large juvenile lobsters in nursery habitats where large conspecifics are removed from large casitas.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,0090-0656,,,,,,,,,,,"Coll.

The majority of the catch and discards comprised lutjanids but also included small demersal reef fishes, highly migratory pelagic fishes, and elasmobranchs. Boat captains targeted artificial reefs at depths <40 m with red snapper abundances that were higher and species diversity that was lower during open seasons than the abundances and diversity found at deeper natural reefs that were fished during closed seasons. On closed-season trips, distance from shore, number of sites fished, and time fished per site were greater, whereas the number of fishermen was significantly lower than the number on open-season trips. The number, size, and proportion of red snapper caught were significantly greater during open-season trips than during closed seasons, but the number of red snapper discards was not significantly different between seasons.

While marine conservation has historically focused on passive habitat protection, demand for and interest in active restoration has been growing in recent decades. However, a disconnect between coral restoration practitioners, coral reef managers and scientists has resulted in a disjointed field where it is difficult to gain an overview of existing knowledge. To address this, we aimed to synthesise the available knowledge in a comprehensive global review of coral restoration methods, incorporating data from the peer-reviewed scientific literature, complemented with grey literature and through a survey of coral restoration practitioners. We found that coral restoration case studies are dominated by short-term projects, with 60% of all projects reporting less than 18 months of monitoring of the restored sites. Similarly, most projects are relatively small in spatial scale, with a median size of restored area of 100 m(2). A diverse range of species are represented in the dataset, with 229 different species from 72 coral genera. Overall, coral restoration projects focused primarily on fast-growing branching corals (59% of studies), and report survival between 60 and 70%. To date, the relatively young field of coral restoration has been plagued by similar 'growing pains' as ecological restoration in other ecosystems. These include 1) a lack of clear and achievable objectives, 2) a lack of appropriate and standardised monitoring and reporting and, 3) poorly designed projects in relation to stated objectives. Mitigating these will be crucial to successfully scale up projects, and to retain public trust in restoration as a tool for resilience based management. Finally, while it is clear that practitioners have developed effective methods to successfully grow corals at small scales, it is critical not to view restoration as a replacement for meaningful action on climate change.",,,,,,,,,183,5,0,0,116,6,214,,,1932-6203,,,,,,,,,,,"James Cook Univ, TropWATER, Townsville, Qld, AustraliaCSIRO, Brisbane, Qld, AustraliaUniv Queensland, Brisbane, Qld, AustraliaMarine Ecol Consultant, Magnetic Isl, Qld, AustraliaReef Ecol, Townsville, Qld, AustraliaLeibniz Ctr Trop Marine Res ZMT, Future Earth Coasts, Bremen, GermanyUniv Bremen, Marine Ecol Dept, Fac Biol & Chem FB2, Bremen, GermanyNature Conservancy, Arlington, VA USASouthern Cross Univ, Lismore, NSW, AustraliaUniv Technol Sydney, Sydney, NSW, AustraliaECS NOAA Fisheries, Off Sci & Technol, Silver Spring, MD USA",Marine Ecol ConsultantReef EcolECS NOAA Fisheries,,,2020-01-30,WOS:000534612400010,31999709,

Coastal destruction, dredging, mining, offshore infrastructure, oil and gas production, pollution, and climate change are among the main anthropogenic threats faced by marine ecosystems, but fisheries have become the human activity with the greatest and most widespread impact upon reefs and other benthic ecosystems. During recent decades, some international conventions have aimed to reduce these impacts, trying also to bring together governments in order to stop the loss of biodiversity in the oceans. However, marine conservation still lags far behind the advances that have been made in the protection of terrestrial ecosystems. Most marine species and habitats are generally not well known or valued by decisionmakers or the general public, and many efforts to introduce conservation measures have been blocked as a result of intensive lobbying by the bottom trawling sector. As a result, advances in management, including conservation, have been slow. There is a general consensus about the need to protect different marine habitats, ecosystems, and communities that are very productive and useful for humankind in many different ways. These are ecosystems which support the life cycles of commercial species, are essential for the global economy, form biodiversity hotspots, or are part of spectacular seascapes that constitute part of natural heritage. Yet the way forward for the conservation of animal forests worldwide is uncertain; there is still a broad and interesting debate on what should be done to protect them, and how this protection should be developed and implemented, both within national waters and in areas beyond national jurisdiction. Advances in international and national policies related to conservation and fisheries management have provided the first steps. However, these developments only address the tip of the iceberg of what should be done, based on the available scientific knowledge. Seamounts, submarine canyons, hydrothermal vents, cold seeps, and other topographic features are known in many cases to be important biodiversity hotspots. Coral reefs, sponge aggregations, gorgonian and black coral gardens, sea pen fields, mollusk beds, and other animal forests have been recognized as key habitats which occur in many cases in association with topographic features such as the ones mentioned above. Most of these ecosystems are gradually becoming part of the international list of vulnerable marine ecosystems (VMEs), and in some regions, measures are being developed to protect them, particularly within Regional Fisheries Management Organizations (RFMOs). Marine science continuously provides data on new species, habitats, and communities, improving our understanding of their interspecific relationships, and the roles they play within marine ecosystems, and in the biosphere as a whole. In turn, marine management, including conservation, should also progress in light of this increasing knowledge. Human impacts must be necessarily included in the final equation, as we will continue to use marine resources. Ultimately, we are responsible for ensuring the long-term sustainability and health of the ocean realm.",,,,,,,,,10,0,0,0,8,0,10,,,,,978-3-319-21011-7,,,,,,,,,"Oceana, Madrid, Spain",,,,2017-01-01,ZOOREC:ZOOR15909064792,,

Inmost areas decommissioning operations will need to be supported by environmental assessment and monitoring, potentially over the life of any structures left in place. This requirement will have a considerable cost for industry and the public. Here we review approaches for the assessment of the primary operating environments associated with decommissioning - namely structures, pipelines, cuttings piles, the general seabed environment and the water column - and show that already available marine autonomous systems (MAS) offer a wide range of solutions for this major monitoring challenge. Data of direct relevance to decommissioning can be collected using acoustic, visual, and oceanographic sensors deployed on MAS. We suggest that there is considerable potential for both cost savings and a substantial improvement in the temporal and spatial resolution of environmental monitoring. We summarise the trade-offs between MAS and current conventional approaches to marine environmental monitoring. MAS have the potential to successfully carry out much of the monitoring associated with decommissioning and to offer viable alternatives where a direct match for the conventional approach is not possible.

Supported by the Minerals Management Service of the US Department of the Interior, DGoMB's purpose was to gain better understanding of how oil and gas exploration and production might affect the ecosystem and its natural inhabitants. The goal of assessing both community structure (abundance, biomass and species composition) and biogeochemical processes (community function) was unique, because traditionally Such studies have been investigated independently. The field work aboard R/V Gyre was conducted in two phases over a 3-year period (2000-02). The first phase, a broad geographic survey stretching from the western eGoM near Mexico to the upper Florida slope, was designed to provide a database from which large detailed maps could be created to explore potential controls on community structure. Physiographic features (depth, the base of steep escarpments, the axes of canyons, methane seep sites, mesoscale salt basins, etc.) were sampled in replicate locations to assess the relationships between topography and spatial distribution patterns. During the second phase (2001-02), a limited number (7) of locations were investigated with measurements designed to estimate rates of processes related to the cycling of organic matter. The strategy was successful in defining the quantitative relationships between carbon cycling (trophic conditions) and community structure (zonation and diversity), for those groups for which species lists were generated (harpacticoid copepods in the meiofauna, macrofauna, megafauna and fishes). In retrospect, additional process locations in the western GoM would have improved the second phase of the study by more rigorously describing the relationships between broader geographic patterns in community structure and trophic conditions.

This approach serves as a bridge between ecologists and engineers. The proposed model, called the layout of artificial reef communities (LARCs) model, not only applies the fractal dimension as an indicator for measuring the complexity into the objective, but considers the costs, the budget, the deploying distance of adjacent artificial reef communities (ARCs), and the number of deployed ARCs to deal with a project in designing the spatial configuration of an AR ecosystem. The main objective of the LARCs model is to achieve the maximal complexity (fractal dimension) because a higher complexity can increase the species diversity and biomass. In addition, a computerized tool written by Fortran program to conduct the design of the spatial configuration is completely proposed, and a case study is followed.

As an emergency measure, this sand was used to create an artificial dune in the grounds of the hotel. Given the high probability of future storms of such magnitude, it was decided that some form of sediment transport control was needed to protect the beach so an artificial reef was constructed 120 in off the shore. The structure, made of prefabricated concrete elements, has been effective as a coastal defense barrier and has also provided a habitat for several reef species. Five years after the placement of the structure the beach front, which had previously registered erosion problems, had returned to its natural cycle of summer growth and winter retreat and a large number of fish and coral species were using the habitat provided by the structure. However, the coral reef growing on this prefabricated structure was not long-lasting.

The sands of the seashore are maintained when it moves to the shore by sea waves. It becomes a dynamic equilibrium. However, beach erosion progresses in the following case. It is reduction of a river discharge and sand. A lot of concrete blocks must be installed near shoreline, and the seashore must be protected. Moreover, when earth-and-sand supply is cut off, the depth of water of the front of wave absorbing works becomes deep. And it will be scattered about with subsidence one after another, and maintenance will take much cost.This research installs an artificial reef near a mouth of a river; the method of capturing the earth and sand from a river more effectively is the purpose. Installation of an artificial reef will produce a local seashore flow. A suitable setting position, method, etc. are examined using this. When installing an artificial reef near a mouth of a river, it is necessary to get to know about current appearance and earth-and-sand movement. In particular, it is necessary to clarify the sand trapping effect of the discharge earth and sand from a mouth of a river. It is observed that there is also an advance tendency of shoreline. Then, the geographical feature change characteristic of the artificial reef installed in certain seashore in the Sea of Japan was arranged.Moreover using the application of the extended type Boussinesq model, we calculate for the time series wave field around the opening. Furthermore, we compare the amount of geographical feature change using the various amount calculation formulas of sediment transport and the amount of local measured depth change.

An innovative and interesting way of protecting a local coastal zone by means of multifunctional artificial reefs avoids some of them. A multifunctional artificial reef is a submerged breakwater which, besides helping to protect the local coastline, can have other purposes; in particular it may enhance the surfing possibilities and the environmental value of the local area. The structure has several positive side effects: first, it provides an unimpaired visual amenity; second, it offers tourist and economic benefits by improving the surfing conditions. A preliminary design, achieved step-by-step, is proposed for a multifunctional artificial reef making use of the theory and state of the art multifunctional artificial reef design, a preliminary design, achieved step-by-step, a priliminary design is proposed.

With the upcoming era of decommissioning of oil and gas structures, it is timely to assess the usefulness of this footage for researching these communities. We used ROV inspection footage to characterize the sessile invertebrates and fishes associated with the Goodwyn Alpha Production Platform (GWA) on the North West Shelf of Australia between depths of 10 and 125 m during 2006 and 2008. Depth was a major driver of invertebrate assemblages, most likely due to specific requirements such as light, and differences between years were most likely from the physical detachment of species by cyclones and internal waves. Phototrophic species were mostly limited to the upper 50 m of the platform, including the hard coral Pociiopora sp. and the soft corals Nephthea sp. and Scleronephthya sp. In contrast, heterotrophic species including sponges, anemones, bryozoans, hydroids, bivalves such as Lopha folium and the hard coral Tubastrea spp., were distributed across all depths. We observed 1791 fish from at least 10 families and 19 species, including commercial species such as crimson seaperch (Lutjanus erythropterus), red emperor (L. sebae), saddle-tailed seaperch (L. malabaricus), mangrove jack (L. argentimaculatus) and trevally (Caranx spp.). Fish density increased significantly with depth during 2008, from a mean of 23 fish/50 m(2) between 10 and 25 m to 3373 fish/50 m(2) at 125 m, where small unidentified baitfish were abundant. The highest densities of commercial species occurred between 25 and 75 m depth, suggesting that mid-depth platform sections had high habitat value, a consideration when selecting decommissioning options. The greatest difficulties using the video were the poor lighting and resolution that inhibited our ability to identify sessile species with high taxonomic precision. However, the footage was useful for evaluating high-level biodiversity of the platform, understanding how fish and invertebrate communities changed with depth and comprehending the dynamic nature of the invertebrate community over time.

However, the effects on the marine ecosystems of potential CO2 leakages originating from these storage sites have only recently received scientific attention, and little information is available on the possible impacts of the resulting CO2-enriched seawater plumes on the surrounding benthic ecosystem. In the present study, we conducted a 20-weeks mesocosm experiment exposing coastal sediments to CO2-enriched seawater (at 5000 or 20,000 ppm), to test the effects on the microbial enzymatic activities responsible for the decomposition and turnover of the sedimentary organic matter in surface sediments down to 15 cm depth. Our results indicate that the exposure to high-CO2 concentrations reduced significantly the enzymatic activities in the top 5 cm of sediments, but had no effects on subsurface sediment horizons (from 5 to 15 cm depth). In the surface sediments, both 5000 and 20,000 ppm CO2 treatments determined a progressive decrease over time in the protein degradation (up to 80%). Conversely, the degradation rates of carbohydrates and organic phosphorous remained unaltered in the first 2 weeks, but decreased significantly (up to 50%) in the longer term when exposed at 20,000 ppm of CO2. Such effects were associated with a significant change in the composition of the biopolymeric carbon (due to the accumulation of proteins over time in sediments exposed to high-pCO(2) treatments), and a significant decrease (-20-50% at 5000 and 20,000 ppm respectively) in nitrogen regeneration. We conclude that in areas immediately surrounding an active and long-lasting leak of CO2 from CCS reservoirs, organic matter cycling would be significantly impacted in the surface sediment layers. The evidence of negligible impacts on the deeper sediments should be considered with caution and further investigated simulating the intrusion of CO2 from a subsurface source, as occurring during real CO2 leakages from CCS sites.

While summer hypoxia typically affects the bottom 3.0 m of the water column, platforms span from the bottom to above the surface and provide hard substrate in oxygenated waters overlaying hypoxia. However, little is known about the effects of hypoxia on organisms living at these platforms. We compared diets of Sheepshead Archosargus probatocephalus and Gulf stone crabs Menippe adina during early and late summer at platforms with mild (shoal platforms) and intense hypoxia (seaward platforms) using a combination of stable isotopes (delta C-13 and delta N-15) and gut contents analyses. We hypothesized that diets at seaward platforms would shift from bottom to platform-dwelling prey during late summer when hypoxia had fully developed and decimated benthic communities, but no such effect was found. Barnacles (Balanidae) were the most common prey found in Sheepshead guts for all samples collected (64.1% of gut contents). Sheepshead gut contents showed high predation of mantis shrimp (Squillidae; 35.2% of gut contents) soon after the formation of hypoxia at seaward platforms, likely reflecting Sheepshead exploiting benthic prey that were vulnerable because of hypoxia. These findings indicate that hypoxia affected the behavior of mantis shrimp in a way that altered their availability for Sheepshead associated with platforms. Comparisons of Sheepshead and stone crab isotope values (delta C-13 and delta N-15) to those of their potential prey and basal sources suggested a high dependence on barnacles (proxy for water column particulate organic matter) and filamentous algae throughout the summer. However, comparisons of isotope values in early and late summer indicated no apparent effect of hypoxia.

Steel corrosion was also monitored to illustrate how oil spills may impact preservation of steel shipwrecks. Microcosms were filled with seawater (SW) and incubated at 4°C.

OTUs affiliated with the Rhodobacteraceae family (biofilm formers and potential oil degraders) were less abundant in the dispersant treatment compared to other treatments in biofilm and SW samples, but OTUs affiliated with the Pseudoalteromonas genus (biofilm formers and proposed hydrocarbon degraders) were more abundant in dispersant-treated biofilms. Overall, functional gene analyses revealed a decrease in genes (predicted using PICRUSt and observed in sequenced metagenomes) associated with hydrocarbon degradation in dispersant-treated biofilms. This study indicates that exposure to oil and dispersant could disrupt the composition and metabolic function of biofilms colonizing metal hulls, as well as corrosion processes, potentially compromising shipwrecks as ecological and historical resources.

J,,,,,,,,,Barry Williams,,Multi-terminal dc transmission micro-grid system for interfacing multiple wind turbines,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Awarded Grant,Aug 31 2008,2008,"Moves to reduce carbon emissions and improve efficiency has primed interest in new technologies for the generation of electrical power. Unlike conventional plant, new generating technologies are not naturally suited to direct connection to the fixed frequency grid supply. Furthermore, in the case of renewable generation, restrictions on geographical location pose problems for electrical connection. Power electronic conversion thus plays a significant role in efficiently capturing and distributing the generated energy. This proposal addresses one important aspect of this research area: the efficient, robust and low-cost capture and transmission of renewable energy (RE) from multiple renewable resources. The use of DC networks to aggregate and transmit power from has been identified as a solution to such problems; to date work in this area has be concentrated at concept study and simulation level. Our collaborative proposal seeks to develop a novel and innovative DC current link system. The research will investigate the academic research aspects of realising a DC current link technology for the capture of renewable energy and other forms of low-carbon-derived electrical energy. Traditional wind turbine interfacing to the AC grid has been based on AC concepts. Recently ABB have installed the first offshore interconnect based on dc transmission. The system uses their standard HVDC Light technology, which offers bidirectional power flow control. Embedded renewable generation whether wind or wave, onshore or offshore, generally does not require the bidirectional power flow capability of HVDC Light (and similar techniques) but does require efficient, low-cost multi-source control. Existing techniques, e.g.HVDC Light, are not suitable. The proposed system departs from existing DC transmission technology. The proposed system is based on the concept that paralleling energy sources should always be based on paralleling current sources - not voltage sources as currently exemplified by HVDC systems. In our proposed system the single-ended step-up converter, operated with an outer current control loop, is the basic building block. The topology is scaleable, reliable and low-cost compared with existing AC and DC converter technologies used in distribution. Connection of additional sources is simple and low-cost thus the system lends itself to community-based schemes. Additionally, the majority of lower power RE systems utilise permanent magnet generators therefore require only unidirectional power flow from the RE source to the grid. The unidirectional nature of the power flow results in significant simplification of the DC system that is not realised in AC systems and existing bidirectional DC technology. The technology that will be developed by this project is a key enabler for the integration of multi-source low-carbon energy. The academic research team will investigate detailed modelling, simulation, design and experimentation on a demonstrator DC link system. Two PhD themes have been identified. The first will have a PhD student investigating the conversion electronics required to buffer and transform generates electrical energy onto the novel network. The second PhD student will research and address the important issue of regulating the flow of power from the low carbon energy source to the centralised grid interfacing converter. A post-doctoral research fellow will provide overall project management, liaise with the industry partner during development of the six-turbine demonstrator site, and assess and evaluate the performance of the demonstrator. On completion of this project, there will be a six 15kW turbine array that demonstrates the novel conversion technologies and innovative control algorithms developed through this important research. The demonstrator will be an exemplar of the synthesis between internationally-leading academic research, industrial experience and exploitation, and entrepreneurial skill.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,DT/F006381/1,,,,,,,,University of Strathclyde,,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:15397555,,

However, the nature, extent, and intensity of this damage has yet to be quantified. Acoustic and video surveys conducted between 2008 and 2010 located and imaged sixteen ancient shipwrecks around the Bodrum and Datca Peninsulas, Turkey, many of which were heavily damaged by trawling activity. The results of this research illustrate the unfortunate reality that many wreck sites in the Aegean Sea are heavily damaged by modern fishing activities. Quantifying the extent and intensity of trawl scars on the seabed further reveals the geographic spread of damage in these areas. The results of these mapping projects call attention to the dismantling of cultural sites by the use of mobile fishing gear on the seabed. By comparing the number of broken artifacts on these wreck sites to other sites that have escaped the effects of trawling, such as those in the Black Sea, we see that shipwrecks that are or were at one time in areas of trawling activity show a considerable amount of damage. The location and condition of these wreck sites helps map and quantify past and recent trawling activity, and pinpoint areas on the shallow coastal shelf where additional trawling restrictions or protected zones may be able to help the preservation of archaeological material.

This study assesses fish diversity and abundance from remotely operated vehicle (ROV) video recordings that were collected by industry during the day and at night in the course of a subsea pipeline survey, at 130 m depth. A total of 34,862 fish from 41 species and 25 families were recorded along the 23 km of pipeline. The pipeline was characterised by a high abundance of commercially important snapper (Lutjanidae) and grouper (Epinephelidae) species. The fish assemblage sampled along the pipeline during the day differed markedly to that sampled at night time. Several ubiquitous predatory species, e.g. Epinephelus areolatus, Lutjanus quinquelineatus, Lutjanus russellii, where present during the day but not at night, likely moving off the pipeline to feed in nearby habitats. Structurally complex mesophotic epibenthic habitat forming invertebrates were observed on the pipeline including; mesophotic corals, crinoids (featherstars), gorgonocephalids (basket stars), hydroids, true anemones and sponges, but elsewhere in the region, historical trawling effort is thought to have removed such organisms and extensively modified the original habitat. These complex epibenthic habitats were considered to be important to commercial target species and the modification or loss of these habitats is thought to have negatively impacted the valuable commercial fisheries in the region. This study suggests pipelines can offer a significant epibenthic habitat and refuge for fish, potentially comparable to the historical habitats lost to trawling. Fish diversity and abundance was observed to be consistently greater where a gap/crevice existed beneath the pipeline and many species were frequently observed in conjunction with the complex invertebrate matrix above the pipeline, under spanning sections beneath the pipeline and at the pipeline-sediment interface, regardless of time of day. Further dietary analysis, spatially explicit fisheries modelling and off-pipeline surveys on the natural seafloor are required to further investigate the ecological value of pipelines and its influence in fish behaviour. The study builds knowledge of mesophotic coastal fish ecology and will help to inform discussions regarding the ecological and fisheries implications of decommissioning and the removal of subsea infrastructure.",,,,,,,,,42,1,0,0,29,0,42,,,0165-7836,1872-6763,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Western Australia, UWA Oceans Inst, 35 Stirling Hwy, Crawley, WA 6009, AustraliaUniv Western Australia, Sch Biol Sci, 35 Stirling Hwy, Crawley, WA 6009, AustraliaWoodside, GPO Box D188, Perth, WA 6840 USAUniv Western Australia, Oceans Grad Sch, 35 Stirling Hwy, Crawley, WA 6009, Australia",Woodside,,,2018-12-28,WOS:000438005100023,,

The MMS and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) have been monitoring coral populations on a long-term basis to detect incipient changes caused by oil and gas activities. The results also help in explaining the widespread degradation of reef ecosystems observed in the Caribbean region over the past few decades. Two sites, each 100 X 100 m and 17-26 m deep, have been monitored since 1988: one on the East FGB; and the other on the West FGB.

We compared our results from 2002-2003 with data collected during die, same period on protected reefs within the Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary (FKNMS). Low values of coral cover on the reefs in the FKNMS exemplify how catastrophic mortality of the formerly dominant Acropora spp. led to degradation of coral assemblages throughout the Caribbean. The FGB remained in exceptionally good condition, largely for reasons of geography; their northern location excluded the cold-sensitive acroporids, so the regional-scale loss of acroporids did not reduce coral cover.

We tested the hypothesis that macroalgae and epifauna growing upwards from protective plastic mesh used in bottom clam culture substitutes for seagrass as a nursery habitat for mobile invertebrates and juvenile fish. By quantifying biomass of epibiota in each season and by seining both day and night on 11 occasions from August 1997 to April 1999, biogenic habitat structure and habitat use by mobile invertebrates and juvenile fishes were quantified on hard clam Mercenaria mercenaria aquaculture leases that were using 2 alternative grow-out methods and on 2 natural habitats, a seagrass bed (Zostera marina and Halodule wrightii) and an unstructured sandflat. The macroalgal/epifaunal biomass per unit bottom area was significantly greater on aquaculture mesh than on the sandflat but did not differ significantly from the natural seagrass biomass density on most sampling dates. Community structure of mobile invertebrates and juvenile fishes utilizing clam leases was more similar to that of seagrass than sandflat habitats. Community similarity among the structured habitats, the seagrass and the 2 lease types, was greater than the similarity between night and day within any given habitat. The total numbers of mobile invertebrates summed over all 11 dates were 75 times greater in the seagrass than in the sandflat habitat, whereas the structural habitat provided by epibiota attached to bottom mesh on leases provided a 44-fold enhancement of invertebrates over the corresponding counts on unstructured sandflat. Utilization by juvenile fishes was 3 times greater in seagrass and 3 to 7 times greater in epibiota on mesh in clam leases than on sandflat habitat. For example, juvenile reef fishes exhibited almost equal utilization of epibiota on leases and seagrass while remaining absent over the sandflat, which lacked emergent structure. Thus, the biogenic habitat provided largely by macroalgal growth on protective bottom mesh of clam leases supports elevated densities of mobile invertebrates and juvenile fishes similar to that of natural seagrass habitat, thereby representing a previously undocumented ecosystem benefit of bivalve aquaculture. This ecological role for structural habitat rising above clam aquaculture leases is consistent with a broader recognition that artificial reefs, plastic seagrass, oyster shell mounds, and other emergent bottom structures provide habitat services.",,,,,,,,,59,1,0,0,56,0,75,,,0171-8630,1616-1599,,,,,,,,,,"Univ N Carolina, Inst Marine Sci, Morehead City, NC 28557 USA",,,,2007-01-01,WOS:000247713900011,,

Objective: In order to investigate the spawning and intracapsular and larval development of this species as tools for its production in captivity for repopulation purposes. Methods: Eighteen brooders were collected and kept in a closed system with controlled parameters and feeding from April 2017 to September 2018. Growth of parents, spawning of ovigerous masses, number of capsules. and number of embryos and larvae within the capsules, were registered. The main morphological structures of embryos and larvae were documented according to their development. Results: Intracapsular embryonic development and veliger larva until its establishment lasted 14-15 and 31-32 days, respectively. Each 80-88 mm length female produced around 4 ovigerous masses, 627 capsules and 663 993 extracapsular veliger larvae per year.

The first concerns a windfarm with a five-year gap between the planning survey and a subsequent cable route and environmental assessment survey. This revealed large-scale movements of sand waves, with the displacement of an isolated feature of 155 m in five years. Secondly, another windfarm development involved a re-survey, again over a five-year period, but after the turbines had been installed. This showed movements of sand waves of similar to 50 m in five years. Observations of the scour effects on the turbines are discussed. Both sites revealed the presence of barchans. Whilst these have been extensively studied on land, there are few examples of how they behave in the marine environment.

Natural events and other anthropogenic impacts may lead to similar effects. A striking phenomenon found in the marine realm is the possibility of regime shifts. Periods with high numbers or biomasses suddenly alternate with periods with lower numbers. Both in the North Sea and in the North Pacific Ocean, sudden, large-scale changes or regime shifts were observed in 1977-1978 and 1988-1989, hinting at possible large-scale causes of these phenomena. In this article, both observations and possible causes are described. Human-induced pollution may also lead to declines in populations. Tri-butyl-tin (TBT) leading to imposex in whelks Buccinum undatum is an example. However, despite high TBT loadings in the Dutch coastal zone, fisheries are still seen as a major cause of the whelk's local extinction. It is argued that the trends that we observe in the marine ecosystem are the result of a very complex interplay between natural and human-induced causes, the final result being an integrated summation of the effects of manageable and nonmanageable factors. Comparing the direct effects of fisheries, sand extraction, and oil or gas extraction in the Dutch part of the North Sea, it can be concluded that, presently, the impact of fisheries on the benthic fauna is a thousand times higher than that of sand extraction and a hundred thousand times higher than that of the oil and gas exploration. Since eutrophication and pollution cannot be expressed per unit area, a direct comparison with effect of fisheries is impossible. However, in general, pollution effects are local, whereas fisheries effects cover the whole North Sea. In conclusion, both natural events and fisheries are the major driving forces of changes observed in the marine ecosystem in the temperate zone.",,,,,Symposium on Effects of Fishing Activities on Benthic HabitatsSymposium on Effects of Fishing Activities on Benthic Habitats,"NOV 12-14, 2002NOV 12-14, 2002",Amer Fisheries SocAmer Fisheries Soc,"Tampa, FLTampa, FL",3,0,0,0,2,0,3,,,0892-2284,,1-888569-60-3,,,,,,,,,"Alterra Texel, NL-1790 AD Den Burg, Netherlands",,,,2005-01-01,WOS:000232152900044,,

Hydrocarbon extractive activities pose threats to native marine biodiversity, such as noise, light, and chemical pollution, physical changes to the sea floor, invasive species, and greenhouse gas emissions. Here, we assessed at a global scale the spatial overlap between offshore hydrocarbon activities and marine biodiversity (>25,000 species, nine major ecosystems, and marine protected areas), and quantify the changes over time. We discovered that two-thirds of global offshore hydrocarbon activities occur in areas within the top 10% for species richness, range rarity, and proportional range rarity values globally. Thus, while hydrocarbon activities are undertaken in less than one percent of the ocean's area, they overlap with approximately 85% of all assessed species. Of conservation concern, 4% of species with the largest proportion of their range overlapping hydrocarbon activities are range restricted, potentially increasing their vulnerability to localized threats such as oil spills. While hydrocarbon activities have extended to greater depths since the mid-1990s, we found that the largest overlap is with coastal ecosystems, particularly estuaries, saltmarshes and mangroves. Furthermore, in most countries where offshore hydrocarbon exploration licensing blocks have been delineated, they do not overlap with marine protected areas (MPAs). Although this is positive in principle, many countries have far more licensing block areas than protected areas, and in some instances, MPA coverage is minimal. These findings suggest the need for marine spatial prioritization to help limit future spatial overlap between marine conservation priorities and hydrocarbon activities. Such prioritization can be informed by the spatial and quantitative baseline information provided here. In increasingly shared seascapes, prioritizing management actions that set both conservation and development targets could help minimize further declines of biodiversity and environmental changes at a global scale.",,,,,,,,,6,0,0,0,5,0,8,,,1354-1013,1365-2486,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Queensland, Sch Biol Sci, Biodivers Res Grp, Ctr Biodivers & Conservat Sci, St Lucia, Qld, AustraliaUniv Queensland, Ctr Excellence Environm Decis, St Lucia, Qld, AustraliaUniv Queensland, Sch Earth & Environm Sci, St Lucia, Qld, AustraliaHebrew Univ Jerusalem, Dept Geog, Jerusalem, IsraelAlbert Ludwigs Univ, Dept Biometry & Environm Syst Anal, Freiburg, GermanyHelmholtz Zentrum Ozeanforsch, GEOMAR, Kiel, Germany",,,,2019-05-27,WOS:000467441900012,30854759,

Why juvenile king crab are attracted to pilings is unknown. Pilings are not structurally complex habitats, but provide hard surfaces for fouling organisms such as hydroids, which are preferred habitat for juvenile crab.

The experiment was conducted in a well-mixed shallow water waveguide which is conducive to characterizing fish aggregations at these distances. Large aggregations of fish were repeatedly seen to emerge rapidly from the shipwreck at dusk, disperse into the surrounding area during the night, and quickly converge back to the shipwreck at dawn. This is a rare, macroscopic observation of an ecologically-important reef fish behavior, delivered at the level of aggregations, instead of individual fish tracks that have been documented previously.

This project applies the EPA's 12 Principles of Green Technology to a cellulose based surface that is coated in nutrients to promote the rapid growth of marine microbes, the base of the marine food chain. This rapid growth, which begins days after being submerged, starts the food chain. The mineral based substrate attached to the cellulose based material is denser than water to allow the entire structure to sink; both the cellulose and mineral based materials will degrade leaving behind nucleation sites for microbes, corals, invertebrate collections, and more. The reef is constructed entirely from biodegradable materials and production costs are economical. The proposed approach combines cellulose with silicates and nutrients (CeNS) to provide a surface for marine life to nucleate and grow. This approach was developed in the PI's lab over the past decade raising marine bacteria that produced marine natural products. The team intends to build on the preliminary results involving carbonate based organisms (i.e. oysters, coral), a place for larvae to grow (i.e. fish, shrimp and octopus), and to provide a food source and shelter for schools of fish. This team has started testing its green technology approach in the Florida panhandle and the Florida Keys.

This shipwreck has structures emerging up to 8 m above the seabed. Water temperature ranged from 4.2 degrees C in March to 20.3 degrees C in August. Salinity showed few variations around 33.9 psu. Bottom tidal currents followed a semi-diurnal cycle and were preferentially NE oriented with 84% of them in the range 0.25-0.75 m s(-1). The mean value for total suspended matter was 6.2 mg l(-1) with large variations on a monthly scale. The species richness of samples varied from 15 in October to 42 in August with a mean value of 33 species. Diversity indices were higher during autumn and winter because of the strong dominance of a few crustacean species during the warmer months. The total density of individuals ranged from 6,500 ind m(-2) in October to 445,800 ind m(-2) in July, most of these individuals belonging to the amphipod species Jassa herdmani. The biomass of the T. indivisa community varied from 9 g AFDW m(-2) in October to 1,106 g AFDW m(-2) in July, with T. indivisa itself constituting between 59 and 82% of the total biomass. The biomass of T. indivisa was positively correlated with species richness and with the density of 23% of the species identified on this community, suggesting that T. indivisa plays an important structural role in this habitat. This was further confirmed by the number of species associated with T. indivisa which was generally superior to 55% of the sorted species. Multivariate analysis indicated strong differences between spring/summer-autumn/winter assemblages mostly but not solely due to the abundance patterns of species. These findings support the conclusion that shipwrecks in Belgian waters allow the development of assemblages dominated by a high biomass of T. indivisa which in turn provides shelter for high densities and biomass of epizoites.

Such installation near the coastline is expected to contribute to enhance the surfing conditions in the area, protect the sand dune system in the surroundings of Leirosa beach, and increase its environmental value. Numerical calculations with the COULWAVE model were performed for four test cases, considering two reef geometries (differing in the reef angle) and two incident wave conditions (storm condition and a common wave condition). Comparisons between the results obtained, in terms of wave heights and breaking line positions allow us to assess the influence of the reef on the hydrodynamics near the beach and around the reef. Moreover, the reef performance was analysed in terms of surfability and coastal protection. The surfability parameters (breaker height, Iribarren number and peel angle) were calculated for each test case using the numerical wave heights, wave directions and wave breaking positions. Comparisons of parameters allow characterizing the most appropriate configuration of the reef to improve the surfing conditions in the study area.

A field test with tethered Mediterranean slipper lobsters, Scyllarides latus, revealed that attack and capture rates for solitary individuals did not differ significantly from those for grouped individuals after either 3 or 24 h of exposure to potential predators. Although predator attack rates on grouped and solitary lobsters also did not differ after 3 h, they were significantly higher on groups than on solitary lobsters after 24 h. Differences in fish behaviour during the first hour of lobster exposure suggest that confusion effects played a role only initially and, presumably, conferred a short-lived advantage on clumped prey. Confusion effects were represented by a higher frequency of passes and reapproaches for fish concentrating on grouped lobsters and a lower frequency of bites. Attacks were more directed for fish concentrating on solitary lobsters. With increasing exposure time, however, groups may have served to facilitate predation because triggerfish (Balistes carolinensis) were equally successful at capturing grouped and solitary lobsters.",,,,,6th International Conference and Workshop on Lobster Biology and Management6th International Conference and Workshop on Lobster Biology and Management,"SEP 10-15, 2000SEP 10-15, 2000",Darden Environm Trust; Florida Sea Grant Programs; Nat Conservancy; Florida Keys Natl Marine Sanctuary; Natl Marine Fisheries Serv; Florida Fish & Wildlife Conservat Commiss; VA Inst Marine Sci; Old Dominion Univ; Florida State UnivDarden Environm Trust; Florida Sea Grant Programs; Nat Conservancy; Florida Keys Natl Marine Sanctuary; Natl Marine Fisheries Serv; Florida Fish & Wildlife Conservat Commiss; VA Inst Marine Sci; Old Dominion Univ; Florida State Univ,"KEY WEST, FLKEY WEST, FL",13,1,0,0,12,0,13,,,1323-1650,1448-6059,,,,,,,,,,"SW Texas State Univ, Dept Biol, San Marcos, TX 78666 USAUniv Haifa, Leon Recanati Ctr Maritime Studies, IL-31905 Haifa, IsraelUniv Haifa, Dept Maritime Civilizat, IL-31905 Haifa, Israel",,,,2001-01-01,WOS:000173571100012,,

Reef materials that retain developed fouling communities or ballast. such as decommissioned petroleum platforms, inactive or derelict ships, and bridge rubble are potential NIS vectors. Habitat provided by reefs placed in areas devoid of natural hard bottom or structure may be colonized by NIS propagules dispersed from natural or anthropogenic sources. A network of reef structures may also create NIS corridors for linking previously unconnected areas. Due to its level of offshore habitat alteration, changing environmental conditions, volume of shipping and boating traffic, and subtropical location, the Gulf Of Mexico may be particularly vulnerable to NIS introductions and has a number of documented NIS. Non-indigenous or invasive species concerns have delayed and increased costs for some recent reef construction projects. The linkages between NIS and constructed reefs are reviewed, and approaches for anticipating, assessing, and controlling introductions are recommended. Using basic information about NIS risks, reef planners can begin to evaluate unintended consequences and incorporate risk management measures to reduce future introductions. Prevention is the most effective risk reduction approach because controlling marine NIS after introduction is expensive and offers limited probability for success. (c) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Nonetheless, surprisingly few studies have sought to combine trophic web modelling tools with the framework of OWF impact assessment. The objective of this study was to develop a holistic and integrated ecosystem approach as a complementary methodology to the traditional OWF environmental impact assessment. To that end, trophic web models coupled with Ecological Network Analysis indices were used to study the structure and functioning of three sedimentary types (sandy gravel, gravelly sand, and medium sand), identified on the proposed site for a new offshore wind farm at Dieppe-Le Treport (Normandy coast). The results from this study demonstrated that the trophic structures are strongly linked to the sedimentary types. The results also highlighted the existence of a maturity gradient moving between the three types of sediment identified. This study underlined the challenge and the need to have detailed biomass data on a maximum of biological compartments to enable an effective OWF impact assessment.

Recently, the quality of coastal waters has been gradually and successfully improved; however, this improvement has caused another issue in coastal ecosystem services: oligotrophication. While oligotrophication, with higher water transparency, has recovered benthic macrophyte vegetation, which have been depressed by phytoplankton derived from eutrophication, local stakeholders have suggested that oligotrophication reduces pelagic productivity and, therefore, fishery production in coastal ecosystems. In contrast, oligotrophication with high transparency has recovered benthic primary productivity, including seagrass vegetation. Seagrasses are quite important for climate change mitigation and adaptation, such as through carbon storage, acidification mitigation, and protection from sea-level rise and storm surges, affects which have been welcomed by other stakeholders. Therefore, harmonizing coastal fishery with environmental conservation goals is now essential for the sustainable use of ecosystem services. Here, we present the scope of our study based on an interdisciplinary approach, including ecological actions, socio-economical actions and psychological actions. We chose to focus on the interaction between oyster aquaculture and seagrass vegetation as a typical ecological action. Coastal organisms have adapted their traits to the environment over a long period of time, so restoration of mixed coastal habitats represents reconstruction of the original process of coastal production. Subtidal seagrass vegetation with intertidal oyster reefs is the original mixed habitats in Japan, which would be expected to enhance coastal production by improving the production efficiency without adding nutrients. A simple field experiment with carbon and nitrogen contents and stable isotope analyses revealed that oyster spats cultivated on a tidal fiat adjacent to seagrass beds had higher nitrogen contents and higher delta C-13 ratios than spats cultivated in an offshore area using only pelagic production. This result suggests that utilization of the traditional mixed habitats, which enables oysters to use both pelagic and various benthic production, has potential to sustain food provisioning services for humans even in an oligotrophic environment.",,,,,,,,,4,0,0,0,3,0,5,,,2432-2830,2432-2830,,,,,,,,,,"Fisheries Res and Educ Agcy, Natl Res Inst Fisheries and Environm Inland Sea, 2-17-5 Maruishi, Hatsukaichi, Hiroshima 7390452, Japan",,,,2019-06-04,BCI:BCI201900528734,,

Additional receivers on surrounding reef sites validated emigrations of tagged Red Snapper from the VPS-monitored sites. We tagged and released 86 Red Snapper and tracked 59 fish for extended periods (17 to 1,096 d). Telemetry tracking patterns identified fish status as active, emigrated, caught (F), or dead (M) at monthly intervals. At the end of the study, 17 fish had emigrated, 24 were caught by fishers, and 18 were active on VPS-monitored reef sites. For all years combined, annual fishing mortality was F = 0.44 (0.27-0.65, 95% confidence limit).

Most information on seagrass carbon storage is derived from studies of a single species, Posidonia oceanica, from the Mediterranean Sea. We surveyed 17 Australian seagrass habitats to assess the variability in their sedimentary organic carbon (C-org) stocks. The habitats encompassed 10 species, in mono-specific or mixed meadows, depositional to exposed habitats and temperate to tropical habitats. There was an 18-fold difference in the C-org stock (1.09-20.14 mg C-org cm(-3) for a temperate Posidonia sinuosa and a temperate, estuarine P. australis meadow, respectively). Integrated over the top 25 cm of sediment, this equated to an areal stock of 262-4833 g C-org m(-2). For some species, there was an effect of water depth on the C-org stocks, with greater stocks in deeper sites; no differences were found among sub-tidal and inter-tidal habitats. The estimated carbon storage in Australian seagrass ecosystems, taking into account inter-habitat variability, was 155 Mt. At a 2014-15 fixed carbon price of A$25.40 t(-1) and an estimated market price of $35 t(-1) in 2020, the C-org stock in the top 25 cm of seagrass habitats has a potential value of $AUD 3.9-5.4 bill. The estimates of annual C-org accumulation by Australian seagrasses ranged from 0.093 to 6.15 Mt, with a most probable estimate of 0.93 Mt y(-1) (10.1 t. km(-2) y(-1)). These estimates, while large, were one-third of those that would be calculated if inter-habitat variability in carbon stocks were not taken into account.

We created species distribution models for 21 species of commercial, recreational, ecological, or conservation importance within the Southern California Bight based on observations from long-term reef surveys combined with high resolution (200 m x 200 m) geospatial environmental data layers. We then combined the individual species models to create a stacked-species habitat suitability map, identifying over 800 km(2) of potential area for reef restoration within the Bight. When considering only the 21 focal species, s-SDM scores were positively associated with observed bootstrap species richness not only on natural reefs (linear model: slope = 0.27, 95% CI = 0.17-0.36, w = 1), but also this result was supported by two independent test datasets.

They are known to be suitable substrates for supporting the development of highly complex fish and zoobenthic communities. However, these areas are threatened by local fishing, due to their peculiar morphology and topography which promote gear entanglement. With the aims of quantifying the impacts of abandoned, lost or otherwise discarded fishing gear (ALDFG) on these rocky habitats and monitoring the biodiversity recovery after ALDFG removal, acoustic and diving surveys were performed to map 15 selected rocky outcrops and one artificial reef (for a total surface area of 21 km(2)). The recovery capability of benthic and fish communities was evaluated by non-destructive techniques in 5 outcrops periodically sampled throughout 18 months. The data collected (number of individuals, species, taxa, and coverage per each species and taxon) were used to calculate three biodiversity indices (species richness, Margalef and Shannon indices) and to assess community recovery. Mapping activities verified the occurrence of 347 ALDFG distributed unevenly over half of the investigated rocky outcrops. The following cleaning operations led to the removal of 362 items, for a total dry weight of 514 kg. The study on biodiversity recovery showed that the complexity of benthic communities gradually improved. In particular, the various biodiversity indices evaluated at the end of the monitoring period generally showed values comparable, or even higher, than those recorded in the reference sites. An increase in biodiversity and species abundance was also observed for fish community; in particular, cryptic species were able to occupy cracks and fractures of rocks previously obstructed by the derelict fishing gear.

However, marine renewable energy devices are likely to have direct impacts and indirect effects on shelf and coastal environments and biota across a range of spatio-temporal scales. These potential effects (both positive and negative) have implications for pelagic, demersal and benthic fish and invertebrate (shellfish) populations, their essential habitats and the fisheries they support. Globally, there is at present a very limited understanding of how large-scale development of marine renewable energy installations (MREI) will affect fish and shellfish populations and the fisheries that exploit them.Whilst some research to date has considered fish sensory responses to probable noise and electromagnetic fields associated with MREIs, the major gaps in knowledge that will have particular socio-economic importance lie in understanding the longer term behavioural and ecological responses, including habitat use by fish and shellfish, arising from marine renewable devices themselves and the areas immediately surrounding areas that exclude fishing. Hence, there is a need to quantify whether fisheries in areas adjacent to fishery exclusion zones around MREI sites in temperate regions are enhanced by the hypothesised biological 'spillover' effect, how MREI areas may be connected biologically, and the biological and socio-economic effects of displacing exploitation pressure from MREI sites to adjacent areas.In the proposed research we will use a novel combination of behavioural tracking, density estimations and modelling approaches to address whether 'spillover' of species abundance (fish, shellfish) as a consequence of the no-fishing area around MREIs enhance adjacent areas. We propose to conduct research at a small-spatial scale, wave energy test site (the Wave Hub, off Hayle, Cornwall) and a Round 1 (R1) 30-turbine offshore wind farm (North Hoyle, off Rhyl, North Wales) and the area north of this towards the R2 Gwynt-y-Mor wind farm currently under construction. Our approach in these locations will be to quantify where large numbers of fish and shellfish of several species (e.g. edible crab, lobster, Atlantic cod, thornback ray) are located in relation to MREI, adjacent and more distant areas, and how much time they spend in those locations over annual cycles. We will then use this precise spatial information for several hundred individuals to scale up to potential population levels using relative abundance data from surveys for these focal species in those areas. From this, empirical estimates of the magnitude of spillover and its spatio-temporal dynamics will be made. These will be compared with spatial fishery models, to assess how rates of exchange of animals between areas accessible and inaccessible to fishing determine outcomes in terms of both spawning potential and fishery yield. We will use an individual-based modelling approach to identify how patterns of space use by fish/shellfish determine these outcomes when MREIs are introduced into stock areas. This research will also undertake a socio-economic analysis of the impacts and benefits to fisheries of MREIs that exclude fishing, and the effects of displacement of fishing exploitation to adjacent areas.These data will be contextualised with the relative abundance of predators of fish (seabirds, marine mammals) in MREI and adjacent areas together with how fish and shellfish movements and space use change in response to variations in the physical environment (wave height, current velocity) will allow a deeper understanding of the drivers of distributional change in target species in MREI and adjacent areas. The proposed research will benefit from using novel tracking technologies, including an acoustic monitoring array that is unique to the UK, to obtain the first long-term movement data for multiple species around MREI sites.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,NE/J012351/1,,,,,,,,Heriot-Watt University,,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:15316768,,

Most mariculture organisms are produced in coastal areas, where space is scarce and user conflicts exist. For extensive cultures farming off the coast at offshore sites could be a solution to eliminate these problems and facilitate further expansion of environmentally sustainable aquaculture. The aim of this study was to examine the biological adequacy of two candidate species for ostreiculture, the Pacific oyster Crassostrea gigas and the European flat oyster Ostrea edulis. Growth rates, condition and mortality in offshore environments were investigated by transferring oyster spat of both species to 4 different sites in 2004 and 2007. Samples were taken every six to eight weeks from April to October and length, width, height and dry mass were measured as well as the Condition Index (CI = dry mass meat-100/ft mass shell) was calculated. Results show that both oyster species grow successfully in a high-energy environment. Mean growth rates are similar to those measured in individuals from coastal habitats (wild banks and cultures) and the CI shows seasonal variation in both species. The survival rate for both species was > 99% in 2007. However, in the previous trial in 2004 a high mortality rate was observed for O. edulis at one single site at the end of the experiment. Differences were observed in the increase of shell length and dry mass between sites and size classes. Taking these results into account site-selection criteria for different offshore locations are presented. We conclude that offshore cultivation of oysters will be successful if site-selection criteria are examined carefully when choosing a location for offshore aquaculture. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Identifying the organisms or functional groups that are responsible for nutrient transfer, and quantifying their influence on ecosystem structure and carbon capture is an essential step for informed management of ecosystems in physically distant, but ecologically linked areas. Here, we combine natural abundance stable isotope tracers and survey data to show that mid-water and bentho-pelagic-feeding demersal fishes play an important role in the ocean carbon cycle, bypassing the detrital particle flux and transferring carbon to deep long-term storage. Global peaks in biomass and diversity of fishes at mid-slope depths are explained by competitive release of the demersal fish predators of mid-water organisms, which in turn support benthic fish production. Over 50% of the biomass of the demersal fish community at depths between 500 and 1800 m is supported by biological rather than detrital nutrient flux processes, and we estimate that bentho-pelagic fishes from the UK-Irish continental slope capture and store a volume of carbon equivalent to over 1 million tonnes of CO2 every year.",,,,,,,,,77,1,0,0,56,0,78,,,0962-8452,1471-2954,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Southampton, Natl Oceanog Ctr, Southampton S014 3ZH, Hants, EnglandInst Marine, Rinville, IrelandOranmore Co, Galway, Ireland",Oranmore Co,,,2014-07-22,WOS:000338335800021,,

Fifteen juvenile C. viridis, along with two common predators and two common fish avoided by the juveniles were put in cages set on the fringing reef of Moorea (French Polynesia). Mortality was measured after 48 h. Behaviour was then observed during the activity period of the fish. The distance of the fish to the shelter was recorded during 5 minutes. Two juvenile size classes (10 turn and 20 mm) were studied separately, with six replicates. Habitat and behaviour of 10 mm juveniles (aged 3 days post-colonization) were related. These juveniles remained close (10 to 50 cm) to their refuge (43.2% of the time for living Porites rus and 86.0% for living Pavona cactus). They stood further away from the dead coral and the artificial one (respectively 33.7% and 7.1% of the time farer than 50 cm from the refuge). Conversely, the habitat had no significant effect on the behaviour of 20 nun juveniles (aged 16 days post-colonization). These juveniles moved off and remained between 83.9% and 93.5% of the time farer than 50 cm from the refuge, depending on the habitat.

Snapper in northern New Zealand is hypothesised to fit this nursery habitat model; however, nursery habitat association and dependency are poorly understood for New Zealand's largest snapper population in the Hauraki Gulf. To better understand habitat usage by post-settlement snapper and identify potential nursery habitats, we surveyed fish communities across a range of structured benthic habitats using fixed-position seabed cameras in Kawau Bay, in the northwestern Hauraki Gulf. Results indicated a low overall abundance of post-settlement snapper, relative to previous surveys at a nearby harbour outside of the Hauraki Gulf. There were also amongst-habitat differences in Kawau Bay, with post-settlement snapper and fish diversity higher in association with horse mussels relative to bare sediment. We anticipated high abundance of post-settlement snapper at restored green-lipped mussel bed sites, but abundance was again low relative to previous surveys outside of the Gulf. While Hauraki Gulf locations other than Kawau Bay may serve as nursery habitats with abundant populations of post-settlement snapper, another possibility is that post-settlement snapper habitat may not be as limiting within the expansive semi-sheltered Hauraki Gulf (potentially following an Effective Juvenile Habitat model).

There was a significant difference in percent unoccupied space with oil-ash bricks possessing a greater percentage of unoccupied space than concrete bricks during the first year of the study. This difference was associated with a greater tendency of barnacles to slough off from the surface of the oil-ash bricks during this period, presumably due to a less stable brick surface.

It is unclear, however, how different habitat types compare. Using large-scale field surveys, we compared the canopy and community structure between eelgrass and rockweed beds in Atlantic Canada and assessed their nitrogen retention, carbon storage, and habitat services. We then used binary network models of predator-prey interactions to determine food-web structure and its robustness to species loss. Despite disparate 3-dimensional canopy structure, both habitats significantly enhanced overall abundance and diversity of associated flora and fauna, including several commercially important species. Significant differences occurred in the species assemblages within and between habitats and were attributed to different settlement opportunities, food availability, predation risk, and maneuverability. While eelgrass plants had higher nitrogen content, rockweed canopies maintained 8-fold greater biomass and, thus, 14-fold greater nitrogen and 8-fold greater carbon retention per unit area. Both rockweed and eelgrass food webs showed similarities to other temperate and tropical seagrass webs, yet their robustness to the loss of most connected species including primary producers was among the lowest; underscoring their vulnerability to disturbances affecting the functionally dominant primary producers. The present study demonstrates that marine vegetation provides important habitat, nitrogen, and carbon storage services, yet the extent of these services depends on the foundation species and its architecture. Changes in canopy structure will therefore have profound effects on associated food webs and ecosystem services. Thus, as increasing human pressures on coastal ecosystems threaten the continued supply of essential functions and services, the protection of marine vegetated habitats should be a management priority.",,,,,,,,,62,1,0,0,56,0,72,,,0171-8630,1616-1599,,,,,,,,,,"Dalhousie Univ, Dept Biol, Halifax, NS B3H 4R2, CanadaICM CSIC, Barcelona 08003, Spain",,,,2011-01-01,WOS:000295342600005,,

Advances in science and technology are unveiling secrets and shattering myths about the oceans that are changing the way we view life on Earth. There is an urgent need to apply these new insights to manage human activities to protect, restore and maintain ocean life in all its variety so that life on Earth can continue to prosper. Not long ago, deep seabed environments were thought to be empty expanses hostile to life. Today, these environments are considered to have been the very cradle for life on Earth and the largest reservoir of biodiversity on the planet. The great variety of deep seabed habitats, which includes hydrothermal vents and cold seeps, seamounts and submarine canyons, abyssal plains and oceanic trenches, and recently discovered asphalt volcanoes, hosts an amazing array of unique ecosystems and species found nowhere else. New surprises are frequent. Overturning traditional notions of deep sea ecology and coral biology, ancient coral reefs dating back to the dawn of civilization have been discovered in just the past five years in dark and frigid waters spanning from Alaska to Antarctica, from Norway to New Zealand. The oceans provide many essential services with substantial socio-economic benefits that are often taken for granted. Recent studies have revealed that oceans are the very fabric of life: they provide oxygen, modulate weather, drive planetary temperatures and chemistry, and absorb substantial amounts of CO2. Oceans also harbor most of the water and biological diversity on Earth. The variety and abundance of marine life is essential to the health and resilience of the oceans, for balanced ecosystems are better able to respond to changing conditions, both natural and human wrought. Much of our current understanding of the open ocean and deep seabed stems from explorations carried out in the last five to ten years. International research projects and global cooperative efforts, such as the Census of Marine Life, are helping to assess and explain the changes in past and present diversity, distribution and abundance of marine species, and to project future ocean life. They have showed us where many large marine animals spend much of their time and enable us to monitor these habitats. Hotspots and key migratory pathways can thus be protected togive vulnerable open ocean species a chance to recover. Historic records compared with current data also tell us that these hotspots are decreasing in size and diversity, highlighting the need for rapid response. On the deep seabed, scientists continue to discover new and unique species on every cruise, and sometimes even new ecosystems and kingdoms of life. But too often scientists have found that other humans, such as fishermen, have been there first, leaving trails of broken corals andflattened sponge reefs in their wake. The same advances in technology that enable us to peer into the ocean's murky depths have also enhanced our ability to exploit open ocean and deep seabed resources. While pollution, shipping, military activities and climate change also threaten marine biodiversity and ecosystems, fishing currently presents the greatest threat. Our ability to exploit has outpaced by far our limited understanding of what is necessary for sustainable use. We have reduced many populations of large open ocean fish stocks to 10% or less of their preindustrial levels and have driven some species to the brink of extinction. The special life history characteristics of deep sea organisms including slow growth, long life - over 200 years in some cases - and a low reproductive rate were discovered only after several significant deep sea fisheries had collapsed from overfishing. Without cautious management and effective regulation, deep sea fish stocks are quickly depleted and their associated seabed habitats and ecosystems destroyed, forcing fishermen to venture to new stocks and new grounds. The benefits of such 'boom and bust' operations are short-lived at best, and are disproportionate to the threats and destruction they cause for ecosystems and species that may occur no place else on Earth. These large-scale fisheries operations further undermine the hopes that oceanic resources can make a substantial contribution to human food security and poverty alleviation, as most of these resources are currently destined for markets in developed countries, and will soon be extinguished. As human activities such as fishing and oil, gas and mineral exploration and exploitation move into deeper waters both within and beyond national jurisdiction, the relative lack of data on deep seabed ecosystems and biodiversity makes it difficult to predict and control their impacts. Still greater efforts are required to compile and review existing knowledge and to employ modern technologies for the discovery, quantification and understanding of deep sea life. What has become clear is that the evolution of the legal system governing these areas has not kept pace with scientific and technological advances and man's expanding footprint on the oceans. The 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) commits countries to protect and preserve the marine environment, and to conserve and wisely use marine resources - regardless of whether these are within or beyond nationaljurisdiction. While countries are concentrating on ecosystem-based management and networks of marine protected areas in their coastal waters and exclusive economic zones, areas beyond national jurisdiction - representing approximately 64% of the ocean's surface - lack the institutions, rules and enforcement mechanisms to ensure that similar considerations and precautionary approaches are applied. Governments and civil society are now faced with a major challenge of developing and deliveringmanagement systems for the deep seabed and open oceans before it is too late and human demands exceed their capacity to give, absorb and support. Especially in marine areas beyond national jurisdictions, current systems need to be updated to: * reflect ecological boundaries not just political boundaries; * incorporate modern ecosystem-based and precautionary approaches; * address the full range and cumulative effect of potential human activities and impacts; * ensure a higher level of protection for vulnerable species as well as for biologically and ecologically significant areas; * make possible a precautionary system of marine protected areas on a representative, biogeographic basis for a suite of reasons including as insurance to protect libraries of yet unknown or poorly understood biological diversity;* provide effective mechanisms to secure compliance and enforcement; and * enable sustainable use today and thus respect the rights of future generations to enjoy andprosper from the same ocean bounty. The conservation and sustainable use of the vulnerable ecosystems and biodiversity in deep waters and high seas are among the most critical oceans issues and environmental challenges today. Immediate impacts and threats, such as those posed by fishing, have to be reduced urgently.Activities that generate long-lasting pollution, alter climate, disrupt oceanic circulation regimes and acidify ocean waters have to be addressed, while we still can.",,,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,1,0,2,,,1014-8647,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2006-01-01,ZOOREC:ZOOR14303018685,,

Taxonomic and biomass analysis of gut contents and benthic resources suggested that at least 70% of the diet of reef fish was derived from the reef itself and another 20-25% from the ecotone. For most reef fishes, suitable prey was 100 times more abundant in the reef habitat than in adjacent sand habitats. Estimates of somatic production by tagged fish were based on standing stocks, size distribution, and growth rates, and by untagged species, on changes in mean length of a cohort or population biomass over time. Estimated total production of the fish on TPAR was 116 kg, or 649 kg.ha(-1), more than a third of it as gonadal production by the six target species. Production by the sand-bottom fish assemblage, estimated from literature-derived somatic and gonadal production rates and the biomass of trawled fish, was 73 kg hectare year(-1). Calculated reef production was, therefore, about nine times greater than the production of sand-bottom fish. From 30 to 70% of the four species of tagged fish (sheephead, rock wrasse, black perch, and garibaldi) that could be captured by divers were recaptured after 7 months, indicating a high degree of fidelity to the reef. Recapture of 12% of tagged kelp bass via hook-and-line after 7 months and the recapture of five tagged kelp bass of a total of 40 kelp bass caught 1 year later by a sport fishing boat indicate that kelp bass, too, remained associated with the reef for long periods.",,,,,,,,,54,0,0,0,38,1,67,,,0007-4977,1553-6955,,,,,,,,,,"MEC ANALYT SYST INC, CARLSBAD, CA 92008 USANOAA, NATL MARINE FISHERIES SERV, SW FISHERIES CTR, HONOLULU, HI 96820 USAUNIV CALIF SANTA BARBARA, INST MARINE SCI, SANTA BARBARA, CA 93106 USASAN DIEGO CTY WATER AUTHOR, SAN DIEGO, CA 92103 USA",MEC ANALYT SYST INCSAN DIEGO CTY WATER AUTHOR,,,1994-09-01,WOS:A1994QB58400038,,

Islands are the coral reefs and hard-bottom (also called hard substrate) biological communities found along the course of a massive stream of ocean currents connecting the Caribbean Sea, the Gulf of Mexico, and the western Atlantic off North America. This expedition emphasizes habitat characterization and an understanding of these islands' connection as parts of an interrelated ecosystem. Though separated by large expanses of ocean water, the fishes, corals, and invertebrates common to these islands may demonstrate that the health and vitality of downstream islands are linked closely to those located upstream.From August to October, scientists explored the deep reef and hard-bottom communities of the South Atlantic Bight, from the east coast of Florida through the North Carolina Shelf. Leg One of this mission, lasting from August 29 to September 7, visited the Oculina Bank, situated 30 km (18 mi) east of the northern Florida coast. Oculina Bank was the first deep-water site in federal waters off the U.S. Eastern Seaboard to be closed to fishing. Once, this area was covered with dense thickets of the ivory tree coral, Oculina varicosa, which provided excellent habitat for reef fish, such as grouper and wreckfish, and feeding grounds for migratory pelagic (deep-sea) species. However, fishing activities destroyed approximately two-thirds of the bank. A fragile and slow-growing coral, deep-water Oculina only grows about one--half inch per year. These and other damaged coral reefs will take many years, even decades, to recover. To aid in the recovery process, a significant portion of the area was closed to fishing in 1994. NOAA has since funded efforts to assess the banks and to attempt to restore the damaged areas. In July 2000, the National Marine Fisheries Service approved plans to expand the protected area, with the goal of saving the remaining ivory tree coral. Much of the protected area is deeper than 100 m (328 ft), rugged, and can only be studied using advanced undersea technologies. The mission will use the HBOI submersible Clelia and an ROV to study the recovery of the reserve. In addition to habitat characterization work, visual observations of artificial-reef restoration structures deployed on the banks beginning in 1995 will help to determine species' rates of recruitment. Scientists will also test a hydrophone array to determine its utility for monitoring grouper spawning.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2017-11-24,DRCI:DATA2017102012047586,,

More than 60 species of LBF are currently described from the Indo-Pacific Ocean with the Philippines being recently identified as their potential center of maximum species richness. The Palawan archipelago, also known as the last ecological frontier of the Philippines and a hotspot of biodiversity, attracts a growing number of tourists due to its comparatively intact marine environments and picturesque landscapes. Here, we document and illustrate the species-rich fauna of modern LBF from shallow nearshore habitats in northern Palawan. Sampling covered the northernmost part of Palawan's South China and Sulu Sea coasts including the Calamian Islands group. A total of 24 samples were taken from fore-reef slopes, inter-reef areas, a back-reef, seagrass leaves with a nearby mangrove swamp, and a WW2 shipwreck at depths between 0 to 25 m. We recorded a total of 44 LBF morphospecies, a number that is among the highest reported so far. Heterostegina depressa and Calcarina mayori were identified as the most widely distributed taxa in the study area. We further describe Peneroplis hoheneggeri nov. sp. as a new species of Peneroplis de Montfort. The newly described peneroplid is characterized by single rows of large pits and was previously also documented from Micronesia.

However, marine renewable energy devices are likely to have direct impacts and indirect effects on shelf and coastal environments and biota across a range of spatio-temporal scales. These potential effects (both positive and negative) have implications for pelagic, demersal and benthic fish and invertebrate (shellfish) populations, their essential habitats and the fisheries they support. Globally, there is at present a very limited understanding of how large-scale development of marine renewable energy installations (MREI) will affect fish and shellfish populations and the fisheries that exploit them.Whilst some research to date has considered fish sensory responses to probable noise and electromagnetic fields associated with MREIs, the major gaps in knowledge that will have particular socio-economic importance lie in understanding the longer term behavioural and ecological responses, including habitat use by fish and shellfish, arising from marine renewable devices themselves and the areas immediately surrounding areas that exclude fishing. Hence, there is a need to quantify whether fisheries in areas adjacent to fishery exclusion zones around MREI sites in temperate regions are enhanced by the hypothesised biological 'spillover' effect, how MREI areas may be connected biologically, and the biological and socio-economic effects of displacing exploitation pressure from MREI sites to adjacent areas.In the proposed research we will use a novel combination of behavioural tracking, density estimations and modelling approaches to address whether 'spillover' of species abundance (fish, shellfish) as a consequence of the no-fishing area around MREIs enhance adjacent areas. We propose to conduct research at a small-spatial scale, wave energy test site (the Wave Hub, off Hayle, Cornwall) and a Round 1 (R1) 30-turbine offshore wind farm (North Hoyle, off Rhyl, North Wales) and the area north of this towards the R2 Gwynt-y-Mor wind farm currently under construction. Our approach in these locations will be to quantify where large numbers of fish and shellfish of several species (e.g. edible crab, lobster, Atlantic cod, thornback ray) are located in relation to MREI, adjacent and more distant areas, and how much time they spend in those locations over annual cycles. We will then use this precise spatial information for several hundred individuals to scale up to potential population levels using relative abundance data from surveys for these focal species in those areas. From this, empirical estimates of the magnitude of spillover and its spatio-temporal dynamics will be made. These will be compared with spatial fishery models, to assess how rates of exchange of animals between areas accessible and inaccessible to fishing determine outcomes in terms of both spawning potential and fishery yield. We will use an individual-based modelling approach to identify how patterns of space use by fish/shellfish determine these outcomes when MREIs are introduced into stock areas.

Efforts to explain this opposition have focused on perceived negative aesthetic and environmental impact. Less attention has been paid to a fuller suite of the perceived risks and benefits associated with new energy technologies. This paper thus investigates impacts of an offshore wind farm pertaining to individual perceptions and judgments, and why risks to some ecosystem services might be cause for greater public concern than others. We find that this difference can be attributed to the affective and intuitive ways in which people perceive risk. Our mixed-methods design used interviews (n = 27) that involved risk-benefit weighting tasks and an animated visualization to help people imagine an offshore wind farm in a familiar place. We found that affectively-loaded impacts (harm to charismatic wildlife and visual intrusion) were assigned greater weight than more easily quantifiable impacts (displacement of fishing, impact to tourism, cost of compliance with regulations). Interviewees identified increased regional energy self-sufficiency as the most valued potential benefit of an offshore wind farm. These results have implications for ecosystem service assessments generally and, more specifically, for our understanding of 'affective' dimensions of development proposals. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Habitat loss consisted of 57.4 ha of subtidal, soft-bottom habitat. The mitigation reef (0.651 ha of surface area) consisted of 16 prefabricated concrete reef structures, arranged in four clusters of four units each, near Brown's Shoal in Delaware Bay. We estimated benthic secondary production of the two sites using published production: biomass ratios (P:B) as a tool for conducting comparisons of benthic epifaunal communities. Results indicate that the artificial reef provides enhanced benthic secondary production per unit area (2000-12000 kcal yr(-1)) over the lost habitat (177 kcal yr(-1)), but that total production (3 and 77 million kcal yr(-1)) does not equal what has been lost (100 million kcal/yr).

In this study, the effects of elevated seawater temperature and partial pressure of CO2 (pCO2) on subtropical sediment systems of mangrove, seagrass, and coral reef lagoon habitats of Okinawa, Japan, were examined. Sediment and seawater from each habitat were exposed to four pCO2-temperature treatments, including ambient pCO2- ambient temperature, ambient pCO2-high temperature (ambient temperature + 4°C), high pCO2 (936 ppm)-ambient temperature, and high pCO2-high temperature. Parameters including primary production, nutrient flux, pigment content, photosynthetic community composition, and bacterial abundance were examined. Neither high temperature nor high pCO2 alone impacted mangrove and seagrass sediment primary production significantly (Tukey's test, P > 0.05). However, the combined stress significantly (Tukey's test, P < 0.01) increased primary production in these two habitats. In sediments from the coral reef lagoon, single and combined stress treatments induced a shift from heterotrophy to autotrophy. Significant increases in net primary production (Tukey's test, P < 0.01), and gross primary production (Tukey's test, P < 0.05) under the combined stress suggested that benthic microalgae in mangrove and seagrass sediments were more responsive to high temperature and pCO2 conditions than those in coral reef lagoon sediments. Additionally, combined stress significantly increased the sediment chlorophyll a content (Tukey's test, P < 0.05) in all habitats. These increases were associated with increased net primary production, indicating that combined stress stimulates primary production activity by the photosynthetic benthic microalgae in all habitats. Diatom activity increased, as silicate uptake increased in all habitats. Microbial abundance significantly increased under the combined stress treatment (Tukey's test, P < 0.01), but did not exceed autotrophic activity. Respiration did not change significantly in any of the three habitats (Tukey's test, P > 0.05) under the combined stress, suggesting that heterotrophic processes were less affected by the combined stress than autotrophic processes. In summary, mangrove and seagrass sediments minimize the negative impacts of elevated temperature and pCO2 via increased primary production and carbon storage. Lagoonal sediments also act as a carbon sink under temperature and ocean acidification stress.

This may include partial removal (from the surface to 26 m depth) or complete removal of the platform structure. While complete removal would likely eliminate most of the existing fish biomass and associated secondary production, we find that the potential impacts of partial removal would likely be limited on all but one platform off the coast of California. On average 80% of fish biomass and 86% of secondary fish production would be retained after partial removal, with above 90% retention expected for both metrics on many platforms. Partial removal would likely result in the loss of fish biomass and production for species typically found residing in the shallow portions of the platform structure. However, these fishes generally represent a small proportion of the fishes associated with these platforms. More characteristic of platform fauna are the primarily deeper-dwelling rockfishes (genus Sebastes). Shell mounds are biogenic reefs that surround some of these platforms resulting from an accumulation of mollusk shells that have fallen from the shallow areas of the platforms mostly above the depth of partial removal. We found that shell mounds are moderately productive fish habitats, similar to or greater than natural rocky reefs in the region at comparable depths. The complexity and areal extent of these biogenic habitats, and the associated fish biomass and production, will likely be reduced after either partial or complete platform removal. Habitat augmentation by placing the partially removed platform superstructure or some other additional habitat enrichment material (e.g., rock boulders) on the seafloor adjacent to the base of partially removed platforms provides additional options to enhance fish production, potentially mitigating reductions in shell mound habitat.",,,,,,,,,42,0,0,0,28,0,43,,,1932-6203,,,,,,,,,,,"Occidental Coll, Dept Biol, Vantuna Res Grp, Los Angeles, CA 90041 USAUniv Calif Santa Barbara, Inst Marine Sci, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USABur Ocean Energy Management, Pacific Reg, Environm Sci Sect, Camarillo, CA USA",Bur Ocean Energy Management,,,2015-09-23,WOS:000360613800040,26332384,

Investigations on the utility of FADs to catch fishes, and factors influencing fishes associated with FADs, require careful consideration of experimental designs. The development of appropriate models, from observations and the literature, should be developed before hypotheses can be tested with robust sampling designs. Robust sampling designs may only be possible if investigators have some role in the planning stage of deploying FADs. If the objective of the study is to determine the influence of FADs on assemblages of fishes, then experimenters need to consider that a 'FAD-effect' (=impact) cannot be demonstrated without controls. Some preliminary studies may be required to determine the spatial extent of a FAD-effect before suitable sites can be chosen for controls. Other controls may also be necessary, depending on the method used to estimate numbers of fishes (e.g. controls for disturbance). Recent advances in sampling designs that are applicable to impact studies are discussed. Beyond-BACI (Before After Control Impact) and MBACI (Multiple BACI) designs are recommended because they cater for temporal and spatial variation in the abundance of organisms, which is generally great for pelagic fishes. The utility of orthogonal sampling designs is emphasised as a means of elucidating the influence of multiple factors and, importantly, interactions between them. Further, nested analyses are suggested to deal with multiple temporal and/or spatial time scales in sampling designs. The independence of replicate FADs should also be considered. Problems of independence include: FADs that are connected, thus providing potential routes of movement of associated fishes; temporal dependence where the number of fish at a time influences the number at the next time due to fish becoming residents; and the fact that the proximity of other FADs may influence numbers of fishes. Solutions to these problems are suggested. The recommendations in this paper are relevant to investigations on pelagic fish of all sizes, with and without FADs.",,,,,,,,,20,0,0,0,15,0,21,,,0214-8358,,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Sydney, Sch Biol Sci A08, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia",,,,1999-12-01,WOS:000084919400002,,

The differences in vegetative growth between two impacted and two undisturbed localities were tested using growth, shoot balance, aborted branches, and leaf and rhizome production of-both plagiotropic and orthotropic rhizomes. The organic matter in sediments, silt clay fraction and light intensity incident on the bottom were also measured in order to evaluate the physical conditions. Environmental and plant variables were measured in three sites placed inside each locality. The vegetative growth was positive in both impacted and control meadows but growth rates were lower in impacted than in control meadows. Average growth, production and shoot balance were greater in plagiotropic rhizomes from undisturbed localities (40.7 +/- 1.75 vs. 28.4 +/- 1.34 mm/year, 1133 +/- 0.06 vs. 708 +/- 0.04 mg DW/ shoot/year, 1.36 +/- 0.08 vs. 0.96 +/- 0.06 shoots/year, respectively). Significantly greater values were also found in undisturbed localities for orthotropic rhizomes in terms of shoot balance and rhizome production (0.07 +/- 0.01 vs. 0.01 +/- 0.003 shoots/shoot/ year and 155 vs. 124 mg DW/shoot/year, respectively). Of the physical parameters measured, only light intensity differed significantly between impacted and undisturbed localities. This parameter was 15.5% to 67.6% lower in impacted localities than in undisturbed localities, and this is the factor that causes the retardation of vegetative growth. The results show that recovery of P. oceanica meadows is possible after eliminating the cause of the impact. However, the very low rates of vegetative growth may prolong the time to total recuperation to almost 100 years. Therefore, effective management of P. oceanica meadows should aim to prevent meadow loss. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

J,,,,,,,,,Brendan Godley,,Quantifying benefits and impacts of fishing exclusion zones around Marine Renewable Energy Installations,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Awarded Grant,Jan 01 2012,2012,"Tidal, wave and offshore wind resources will be important for meeting an increasing proportion of society's future energy needs. However, marine renewable energy devices are likely to have direct impacts and indirect effects on shelf and coastal environments and biota across a range of spatio-temporal scales. These potential effects (both positive and negative) have implications for pelagic, demersal and benthic fish and invertebrate (shellfish) populations, their essential habitats and the fisheries they support. Globally, there is at present a very limited understanding of how large-scale development of marine renewable energy installations (MREI) will affect fish and shellfish populations and the fisheries that exploit them.Whilst some research to date has considered fish sensory responses to probable noise and electromagnetic fields associated with MREIs, the major gaps in knowledge that will have particular socio-economic importance lie in understanding the longer term behavioural and ecological responses, including habitat use by fish and shellfish, arising from marine renewable devices themselves and the areas immediately surrounding areas that exclude fishing. Hence, there is a need to quantify whether fisheries in areas adjacent to fishery exclusion zones around MREI sites in temperate regions are enhanced by the hypothesised biological 'spillover' effect, how MREI areas may be connected biologically, and the biological and socio-economic effects of displacing exploitation pressure from MREI sites to adjacent areas.In the proposed research we will use a novel combination of behavioural tracking, density estimations and modelling approaches to address whether 'spillover' of species abundance (fish, shellfish) as a consequence of the no-fishing area around MREIs enhance adjacent areas. We propose to conduct research at a small-spatial scale, wave energy test site (the Wave Hub, off Hayle, Cornwall) and a Round 1 (R1) 30-turbine offshore wind farm (North Hoyle, off Rhyl, North Wales) and the area north of this towards the R2 Gwynt-y-Mor wind farm currently under construction. Our approach in these locations will be to quantify where large numbers of fish and shellfish of several species (e.g. edible crab, lobster, Atlantic cod, thornback ray) are located in relation to MREI, adjacent and more distant areas, and how much time they spend in those locations over annual cycles. We will then use this precise spatial information for several hundred individuals to scale up to potential population levels using relative abundance data from surveys for these focal species in those areas. From this, empirical estimates of the magnitude of spillover and its spatio-temporal dynamics will be made. These will be compared with spatial fishery models, to assess how rates of exchange of animals between areas accessible and inaccessible to fishing determine outcomes in terms of both spawning potential and fishery yield. We will use an individual-based modelling approach to identify how patterns of space use by fish/shellfish determine these outcomes when MREIs are introduced into stock areas.

However, marine renewable energy devices are likely to have direct impacts and indirect effects on shelf and coastal environments and biota across a range of spatio-temporal scales. These potential effects (both positive and negative) have implications for pelagic, demersal and benthic fish and invertebrate (shellfish) populations, their essential habitats and the fisheries they support. Globally, there is at present a very limited understanding of how large-scale development of marine renewable energy installations (MREI) will affect fish and shellfish populations and the fisheries that exploit them.Whilst some research to date has considered fish sensory responses to probable noise and electromagnetic fields associated with MREIs, the major gaps in knowledge that will have particular socio-economic importance lie in understanding the longer term behavioural and ecological responses, including habitat use by fish and shellfish, arising from marine renewable devices themselves and the areas immediately surrounding areas that exclude fishing. Hence, there is a need to quantify whether fisheries in areas adjacent to fishery exclusion zones around MREI sites in temperate regions are enhanced by the hypothesised biological 'spillover' effect, how MREI areas may be connected biologically, and the biological and socio-economic effects of displacing exploitation pressure from MREI sites to adjacent areas.In the proposed research we will use a novel combination of behavioural tracking, density estimations and modelling approaches to address whether 'spillover' of species abundance (fish, shellfish) as a consequence of the no-fishing area around MREIs enhance adjacent areas. We propose to conduct research at a small-spatial scale, wave energy test site (the Wave Hub, off Hayle, Cornwall) and a Round 1 (R1) 30-turbine offshore wind farm (North Hoyle, off Rhyl, North Wales) and the area north of this towards the R2 Gwynt-y-Mor wind farm currently under construction. Our approach in these locations will be to quantify where large numbers of fish and shellfish of several species (e.g. edible crab, lobster, Atlantic cod, thornback ray) are located in relation to MREI, adjacent and more distant areas, and how much time they spend in those locations over annual cycles. We will then use this precise spatial information for several hundred individuals to scale up to potential population levels using relative abundance data from surveys for these focal species in those areas. From this, empirical estimates of the magnitude of spillover and its spatio-temporal dynamics will be made. These will be compared with spatial fishery models, to assess how rates of exchange of animals between areas accessible and inaccessible to fishing determine outcomes in terms of both spawning potential and fishery yield.

For the first objective, the collected data were divided into three spatial strata: two identical strata consisting of either artificial reef presence or absence; a larger stratum further normalized in size for easier analysis and comparison with the remaining observed space (strata A, B and C, respectively). Results show that analyses of the spatial strata differed significantly with regard to the occurrence of fishing vessels, denoting by comparison a higher use associated with artificial reef areas, and that stratum A was statistically different from B (P-values from Tukey's HSD test: (B-A) = 0.032, (C-A) = 0.115, (C-B) = 0.857). For the second objective, the observational data were allocated to only one spatial stratum. A methodology applying generalized additive models was used to understand the influence of environmental and economic factors on fishing decisions. The co-variates incorporated into the model were: sea surface water temperature, wind speed, wave height, rainfall, fish price, fuel price (petrol and diesel), and recreational activity. By contrast, relative to effects on fishing, most of the co-variates had a non-linear association with fishing vessel occurrences. Best fit was achieved with GAM model 2, where the rainfall predictor was removed (adjusted r(2) = 0.582, deviance explained 66%, UBRE score = 2.28).

However, while physical and chemical processes are relatively well-investigated, the biological communities associated with these habitats are poorly studied. We compared the sessile community developed on panels of different materials placed on two historical shipwrecks, the Fougueux and the Bucentaure, from the Battle of Trafalgar (October 1805). Six materials used at the construction of vessels at the 18th and 19th centuries were selected: copper, brass, cast iron, carbon steel, pine and oak. The sessile community developed on the panels was studied two and 15 months after their immersion at the water to determine the effects of materials and environmental conditions (sediments, waves, hydrodynamic conditions, temperature and salinity) on ecological succession and the possible implications at the conservation of historical shipwrecks. On the Fougueux, the environmental conditions more strongly influenced the biological succession than the material type, with pioneer colonisers dominating the communities in both sampling periods. On the Bucentaure, exposed to more stable environmental conditions, the sessile community showed differences between sampling periods and among materials at the end of the experiment. Under these more stable environmental conditions, the material type showed a higher influence on the sessile community. Species that produce calcareous concretions developed on metallic panels, but were absent on wood panels, where the shipworm Teredo navalis was more abundant. The relationship between environmental conditions, sessile organisms and material type can influence the conservation status of the archaeological sites. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

A pelagic-benthic coupling model expressing both phosphorus and nitrogen cycling was developed to investigate seasonal variation in the associated nutrients and their annual budget in the ATR areas and the entire bay system. The model consists of equations representing all the relevant physical and biological processes. The model reproduced the observed seasonal variations in dissolved inorganic P, ammonium, and nitrate concentrations that were low in spring and summer and high in autumn and winter. The internal regeneration rates of the nutrients were two times higher in the ATRs than in the bay area, so that fish production was predicted to be higher in the ATRs than in the bay area. Considering the inflows from the land and precipitation are quite low, nutrient regeneration is an important source of nutrients for the water in Mitsu Bay.

The morphology of the deep Congo submarine channel and the sedimentological structures of the deep-sea fan were established during the geological ZAIANGO project and helped to select study sites ranging from 350 to 4800 m water depth inside or near the channel and away from its influence. Ifremer conducted eight deep-sea cruises on board research vessels between 2000 and 2005. Standardized methods of sampling together with new technologies such as the ROV Victor 6000 and its associated instrumentation were used to investigate this poorly known continental margin. In addition to the study of sedimentary environments more or less influenced by turbidity events, the discovery of one of the largest cold seeps near the Congo channel and deep coral reefs extends our knowledge of the different habitats of this margin. This paper presents the background, objectives and major results of the BIOZAIRE Program. It highlights the work achieved in the 16 papers in this special issue. This synthesis paper describes the knowledge acquired at a regional and local scale of the Equatorial East Atlantic margin, and tackles new interdisciplinary questions to be answered in the various domains of physics, chemistry, taxonomy and ecology to better understand the deep-sea environment in the Gulf of Guinea.

Because the recreational benefits of ecosystem services provided by ARs are valuable and within the scope of public goods, they should be evaluated. In this study, two non-market methods, the Travel Cost Method (TCM) and the Contingent Valuation Method (CVM), were used to estimate the recreational value of ARs in Penghu, Taiwan. Estimations based on TCM results showed that boat anglers' recreational benefit (consumer surplus) was US$281.9 per trip and that scuba divers' recreational benefit (consumer surplus) was US$348.5 per dive. The CVM estimation results indicated that the projected ticket fares were US$13 and US$12.7 for boat fishing and scuba diving, respectively. When the yearly tourist numbers were taken into account, yearly revenues of approximately US$1.7 million and US$1.9 million were estimated from ticket sales, whereas the yearly economic values of boat fishing and scuba diving were US$37 million and US$52 million, respectively. The development of recreational activities on and around ARs could provide substantial economic benefits. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

This is the first study documenting natural scleractinian coral recruitment onto a stabilised pulverised fuel ash (PFA)-conerete artificial reef. Visible recruits were first recorded 9-10 months after the placement of reef blocks, i.e., in the autumn of 1994. Two scleractinians, Oulastrea crispata and Culicia japonica, were recruited. The recruit density of the former was much greater than the latter. The spatial recruitment pattern of the corals was observed to be affected by the orientation of the attaching surface. O. crispata settled predominantly on the undersides of the reef blocks. There was an edge effect on O. crispata recruitment. C japonica, however, had a preference for exposed surfaces. O. crispata did not show a preference for block composition whereas C japonica favoured blocks with high (75% by volume) PFA levels. This shows that PFA-concrete is a potential substratum for artificial reef construction, especially when such reefs aim at rehabilitating corals. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd.

While ample knowledge of these processes exists for terrestrial environments, seasonal timing in the marine environment is relatively understudied. Here, we characterized the annual rhythm of habitat use in six fish species belonging to the Sparidae family, highlighting the main environmental variables that correlate to such rhythms. The study was conducted at a coastal artificial reef through a cabled observatory system, which allowed gathering underwater time-lapse images every 30 minutes consecutively over 3 years. Rhythms of fish counts had a significant annual periodicity in four out of the six studied species. Species-specific temporal patterns were found, demonstrating a clear annual temporal niche partitioning within the studied family. Temperature was the most important environmental variable correlated with fish counts in the proximity of the artificial reef, while daily photoperiod and salinity were not important. In a scenario of human-induced rapid environmental change, tracking phenological shifts may provide key indications about the effects of climate change at both species and ecosystem level.

The eastern oyster (Crassostrea virginica) is an ecosystem engineer that creates intertidal reefs, filters water, promotes denitrification, stabilizes shorelines, and provides habitat throughout the inner waters of the U.S. South Atlantic Bight (SAB). We quantified physical variables (temperature, salinity, duration and depth of water inundation), oyster reef properties (slope, vertical relief), and oyster recruitment, density, and biomass over a 1500 km scale across the SAB for one year. All oyster-level and many reef-level variables exhibited unimodal patterns with latitude that peaked in Georgia and South Carolina estuaries. Of the physical variables, salinity and duration of water inundation over reefs were similar across all sites, and temperature declined linearly with increasing latitude, except during summer when it had no relationship with latitude. Depth of water inundation over reefs was the only physical variable with a prominent unimodal distribution that may explain the oyster's biological responses. Similar durations of water inundation across all reefs coupled with higher water depths in the mid-latitude sites collectively indicate that these sites experience higher flow velocity, energy and net water volume delivery per unit time. The resultant higher accumulation of oyster biomass and heightened reef structure in areas of higher tidal energy emphasize that the physical forcing of the SAB (especially large cross-shelf gradients in tidal amplification) affects the biology of the eastern oyster, including its reef properties, with potential implications for community structure and ecosystem service delivery across a biogeographic scale.",,,,,,,,,54,1,0,0,47,0,64,,,0024-3590,1939-5590,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Georgia, Odum Sch Ecol, Athens, GA 30602 USANortheastern Univ, Ctr Marine Sci, Dept Marine & Environm Sci, Nahant, MA 01908 USAUniv North Carolina Chapel Hill, Inst Marine Sci, Morehead City, NC USA",,,,2015-05-01,WOS:000354490100025,,

It is known that marine birds such as red-throated divers are highly sensitive to disturbance caused by the construction and operation of offshore wind farms and are subsequently displaced from areas used in the non-breeding season. But the physiological, energetic and demographic consequences of such effective habitat loss is currently unknown. This report details the third field season of the Red-throated Diver Energetics Project (https://jncc.gov.uk/our-work/rtde-project). During 2018-2020, archival geolocator (GLS) and time depth recorder (TDR) tags were deployed and retrieved from red-throated divers breeding in Scotland, Finland and Iceland to quantify foraging behaviour and approximate non-breeding season locations. This empirical data will provide insight into the time divers spend foraging, thus providing insight into whether divers potentially have capacity to accommodate displacement effects of offshore wind development. Due to the coronavirus pandemic, no fieldwork for the Red-throated Diver Energetics Project was carried out in Scotland in 2020. However, some breeding success monitoring and ringing of chicks was carried out by local ringing groups, during which, one adult tagged bird was caught, and its tags removed. In Finland, 15 tagged birds were resighted and eight of these were trapped. In Iceland, six tagged birds were trapped. Tags were also recovered from three dead birds during winter 2019/20. No tags were deployed in 2020. Breeding success was calculated as the total number of nests producing at least one fledged chick (% grown) divided by the number of nests of known fate. Breeding success during summer 2020 was variable between sites, ranging from 35% in Shetland to 59% in Finland and 66% in Orkney. The success rates in both Orkney and Finland were average compared to 2018 and 2019, however for Shetland the success rate was poor compared to the previous two years. Breeding success metrics for Iceland were unavailable at the time of writing. If leg-mounted tags have a negative impact on divers, e.g. by increasing drag on divers' legs when diving for prey, then we would expect body condition of tagged birds to be lower in 2020, compared with when they were first tagged, after having carried tags for one or two years. Using body mass as a proxy of body condition, repeated weighing of the same individuals allows assessment of any change in body condition after carrying tags for one or two years. The mass of birds caught in 2020 was compared with the mass of when they were first caught and tagged in either 2018 or 2019. The average difference between first and second year of capture was 3.7g, suggesting negligible change over time, and this was supported by analysis which found no significant change in median body mass between captures. Of the 18 tagged birds recovered dead or recaptured during the 2019/20 winter and 2020 summer, a total of 14 TDR and 18 GLS tags were retrieved. In some cases, birds had lost a TDR tag (n=3) or did not have a TDR tag deployed (n=1). Data for a full winter period were available from 15 GLS tags, another two GLS tags failed to record any data and one GLS tag provided data for only some of the winter period. The problems with substantial GLS tag failure due to water ingression, encountered in 2019, were absent and tag failure rate for GLS tags retrieved in 2020 was low for a study of this sort. Ten TDR tags provided data for the post-breeding and mid-winter period, with batteries dying prematurely in two TDR tags, in October and November, and the remaining eight TDR tags recording until late December/early January, consistent with the TDR tags retrieved in 2019. Additionally, four TDR tags only recorded for short periods, until July, August or September, due to the tag casing being damaged. The cause of the damage is unknown but occurred during deployment. GLS tag data for two consecutive years are available for five birds and TDR tag data are available for three birds over two consecutive years, allowing for novel insight into interannual variation in location and foraging behaviour. Due to an absence of breeding success data for Iceland at the time of writing, it was not possible to conduct further analyses this year on trapping effects. Although 2020 was the third and final field season for Finland and Iceland, we hope that a third year of tag retrieval fieldwork can be undertaken in Scotland next year, subject to coronavirus restrictions.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,0963-8091,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2021-11-21,ZOOREC:ZOOR15712083132,,

The StructureScan, present in modern commercially available chartplotters, such as Simrad's NSS7, provides echosounding with SideScan and DownScan options, and is an imaging echosounder operating at 455 kHz and 800 kHz frequencies in two side beams and one downscan beam. When combined with seafloor samples, it is able to provide an understanding of the differences in material and texture of the seabed. The different textural responses from sediments and objects on the seafloor make it possible to differentiate and precisely locate them. These objects can be natural, such as reefs and isolated stones, or manmade, such as shipwrecks. This work consisted on mapping the sedimentary structures and different bottom types of the reefs from the Parque Municipal Marinho da Coroa Alta/BA, by using the aforementioned side scan mounted permanently on Iamany, a 7 m-long, fiberglass-hull, twin-engine boat. Simultaneously, bathymetric data was acquired in order to generate a complete bathymetric map of the area and generate a digital elevation model of the seabed. Later, the results from the reef scanning will be compared with satellite images of the seabed and granulometric /compositional analysis from the sediments, in order to check how accurate this remote method of mapping is for coral reef areas. Several different bottom types are easily recognised, including coral and algal reefs, flat areas of hard bottom sediments, sand waves and sand sheets covering both reef tops and flat areas, and, eventually, man-made objects, such as a possible shipwreck.",,,,,IEEE/OES Acoustics in Underwater Geosciences Symposium (RIO Acoustics)IEEE/OES Acoustics in Underwater Geosciences Symposium (RIO Acoustics),"JUL 29-31, 2015JUL 29-31, 2015",IEEE OESIEEE OES,"Rio de Janeiro, BRAZILRio de Janeiro, BRAZIL",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,978-1-4673-7019-6,,,,,,,,,"Univ Fed Rio de Janeiro, Dept Geol, Inst Geociencias, IGEO, Rio De Janeiro, RJ, Brazil",,,,2015-01-01,WOS:000412164600030,,

To elucidate red snapper use of artificial structure for fisheries management, their fine-scale movements need to be examined further. Much effort until now has focused on examining movement patterns of red snapper at isolated reef structures, yet fish may behave differently on reefs covering larger areas. To address this, 15 red snapper were internally tagged with V9P transmitter tags and tracked with VR2W receivers for three months at a large artificial reef (PS-1047, 0.8 km(2), bottom depth range 21 m-23 m) that was comprised of a tugboat and over 4800 concrete culverts deployed randomly around the area. Ten receivers were arranged on the reef to calculate center of activity and depth for each fish every 20 min. Kernel densities (KDE) were calculated at 95% (77,905.04 +/- 1843.27 m(2)) and 50% (16,797.25 +/- 413.02 m(2)) to address home range and core area use, respectively. There were differences in KDE and depth per day, and depth exhibited diel patterns. There were significant decreases in KDE and increases in depth use after a drastic drop in sea surface temperature. Overall fish use of PS-1047 resulted in two key areas (50% KDE), which comprised of two main groups of fish without overlap and highlighted two different structure areas (tugboat vs. culvert). Home range and core area values were more than 4 times larger than reported in other studies on red snapper.",,,,,,,,,8,2,0,0,8,0,15,,,0165-7836,1872-6763,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Texas Rio Grande Valley, Sch Earth Environm & Marine Sci, Brownsville, TX 78520 USATexas Parks & Wildlife Dept, Lower Laguna Madre, Coastal Fisheries Div, Brownsville, TX 78520 USA",Texas Parks & Wildlife Dept,,,2018-12-28,WOS:000451654100006,,

However, these tools have inherent sources of bias and the SCUBA divers who perform them are highly constrained in terms of survey time, maximum depth and frequency of sampling. Alternatives like underwater video are thus being recommended in a wide range of configurations. Yet, all these techniques are still limited in field of view, particularly when compared to the ability of a SCUBA diver performing censuses. In this scope, we evaluated the potential of an underwater wide-angle camera (UWC) to survey fish assemblages by testing it against instantaneous underwater visual census (UVC). Our results showed minimal yet significant differences between methods, mainly because of the camera's loss of resolution when under extreme visibility conditions. Both approaches had the same consistency and ability to detect changes in fish assemblages but, to estimate total species richness, the UWC needed less field effort. Moreover, a SCUBA diver performing census had an effect on fish assemblages which introduced differences of greater magnitude than those found between methods. The removal of the diver effect, the proven ability to detect changes in fish assemblages and the verified gain in field effort, pointed the wide-angle camera as a promising tool to perform census of reef fishes.

In response, there is growing scientific interest in novel multi-functional coastal defence structures with built-in secondary ecological and/or socio-economic benefits. To ensure research efforts are invested effectively, it is first necessary to determine what secondary benefits can potentially be built-in to engineered coastal defence structures, and further, which of these benefits would be most desirable. It is unlikely that secondary benefits are perceived in the same way across different stakeholder groups. Further, their order of priority when evaluating different options is unlikely to be consistent, since each option will present a suite of compromises and trade-offs. The aim of this study was to investigate stakeholder attitudes towards multi-functional coastal defence developments across different sector groups. A preliminary questionnaire indicated unanimous support for implementing multi-functional structures in place of traditional single-purpose ones. This preliminary survey informed the design of a Delphi-like study, which revealed a more nuanced and caveated level of support from a panel of experts and practitioners. The study also elicited a degree of consensus that the most desirable secondary benefits that could be built-in to developments would be ecological ones prioritised over social, economic and technical benefits.

In this sense, much effort is dedicated to identify reef resilience indicators and traits, the restoration and protection of which can promote coral reef recovery following degradation. Here we examine two widely studied reef resilience traits, i.e. coral recruitment and structural complexity, and potential links between the two on different spatial scales that may be used to promote reef resilience by active restoration. Specifically, we explore the use of structural complexity enhancement (SCE; artificially increasing the complexity of a degraded reef by adding structures to it) as a potential restoration tool for increasing coral recruitment. Our SCE experiments resulted in an increase of 400-600% in coral recruitment, which was correlated with some of the spatial scales of complexity. From a management perspective, the current study supports the idea that, under certain circumstances, SCE may serve as an effective restoration tool to enhance coral recruitment, which could be an alternative or addition to coral transplantation. The results also emphasize the importance of measuring and enhancing structural complexity on different spatial scales (from mm to m) for the promotion of different functional groups (e.g. corals and fish).

Although the stock is now showing signs of recovery, management could benefit from a better understanding of regional or even habitat-level differences in stock demographics, as these dynamics ultimately determine overall stock productivity. From 2012 to 2014, we used a fishery-independent vertical line survey to assess Red Snapper relative abundance, size and age structure, and growth parameters at standing oil and gas platforms, decommissioned platform artificial reefs, and natural banks in the western GOM. We captured 1,170 Red Snapper ranging from 275 to 855 mm TL. Vertical line CPUE data showed no differences among the three habitat types. Ages determined for 1,143 individuals ranged from 2 to 30 years; however, most (90%) were younger than age 8. Size and age frequencies revealed that natural banks supported a greater proportion of large and relatively old fish compared to standing platforms or artificial reefs, although this difference was heavily influenced by a single bank that had significantly larger and older Red Snapper than other sites. Mean age was not significantly different among habitat types.

The number of enmeshed animals in the experimental gill nets increased rapidly within one month after deployment, and then declined gradually showing fluctuations caused by the decrease in newly enmeshed animals, and the drop off from gill nets caused by the decomposition of dead animals. The decrease in the number of enmeshed animals was expressed by logarithmic equations, and based on these equations, the duration of capture function for the lost gill nets was calculated to be 284-561 days in the artificial reef gill net and 200 days in the sandy bed gill net.

Biogenic reefs formed by bivalves are biodiversity hot spots that provide important ecosystem services, but are globally endangered.

Captive breeding and translocation have been proposed as potential restorative strategies for the remaining reefs, and thus the reproductive biology of M. modiolus as the keystone species needs to be described prior to attempting large-scale ecological restoration. 3. Physiological condition and gametogenesis were studied in two sympatric M. modiolus subpopulations using direct gonad assessment methods. The size- and age-frequency structure of the whole metapopulation were described to establish present or past recruitment events. 4. Although gonad condition remained high in each year for the two subpopulations studied, significant losses were recorded in one subpopulation. These observations are consistent with autumn and winter spawning, but were not recorded in reefs thought to be more damaged by MFG. 5. Length- and age-frequency histograms showed a distinct bimodal distribution in all remnant M. modiolus subpopulations, which were dominated by mussels over 50years old. Little or no successful recruitment has occurred in some subpopulations, where low reproductive output caused by declines in broodstock numbers might be preventing natural recovery. 6.

The surveyed macroalgal beds were located on 8 natural rocky or boulder shores and 3 subtidal stone-built artificial reefs. A transect was set at each bed between the upper and lower limits of the macroalgal vegetation to investigate vertical distribution patterns of the constituent species.

In general, sargassaceous plants were dominant from the intertidal to 4 m depth, and E. kurome distributed in deeper zones than sargassaceous plants, down to 14 m at the deepest. However, in some beds on the southern coasts of the islands, this vertical pattern was reversed. Ecklonia grows on rocky substrata which was stable and free from the effects of sand action, though sargassaceous plants grow on boulders distributed in zones deeper than the Ecklonia zones. On artificial reefs, similar vegetation with those on natural substrata was established. On reefs of the northern coast of Yashiro Is.

We carried out this evaluation using sediment samples collected at drilling Region III on the Norwegian continental shelf where DNA metabarcoding of eukaryotic diversity was already performed. Generally, the quantification of microfauna indicator taxa related well to the gradient of contamination on the seafloor. Contrary to eukaryotic Euplotida, metabarcoding data and qPCR numbers for indicative prokaryotic taxa showed the same relationship to offshore contaminants (both showed positive relationship). We found absolute numbers of SSU rRNA gene copies of (1) Dinophyceae, Bacillariophyceae and Alcanivorax were correlated with the level of petroleum-related compounds but not with other environmental variables, (2) bacteria closely related to Shewanella were correlated with the concentration of Ba, PAH, as well to percent of gravel, (3) Desulfobacteriales correlated with petroleum-related contaminants, but as well with percent of gravel and grain size.Findings from our study suggest that biomonitoring surveys of O&G activities on benthos could benefit from quantification of specific micro-fauna indicators that is simpler and faster than the methods currently used for impact assessment of benthos.",,,,,,,,,6,0,0,0,6,0,6,,,0048-9697,1879-1026,,,,,,,,,,"NORCE, Norwegian Res Ctr, Environm, Mekjarvik 12, N-4070 Randaberg, Norway",,,,2020-09-20,WOS:000542088100014,32497879,

Such activities may accidentally lead to oil spills in partly ice-covered ocean areas, which raises issues related to oil spill response. Net Environmental Benefit Analysis (NEBA) is the process that the response community uses to identify which combination of response strategies minimises the impact to environment and people. The vulnerability of Valued Ecosystem Components (VEC's) to oil pollution depends on their sensitivity to oil and the likelihood that they will be exposed to oil. As such, NEBA requires a good ecological knowledge base on biodiversity, species' distributions in time and space, and timing of ecological events. Biological resources found at interfaces (e.g., air/water, ice/water or water/coastline) are in general vulnerable because that is where oil can accumulate. Here, we summarize recent information about the seasonal, physical and ecological processes in Arctic waters and evaluate the importance these processes when considering in oil spill response decision making through NEBA. In springtime, many boreal species conduct a lateral migration northwards in response to sea ice retraction and increased production associated with the spring bloom. However, many Arctic species, including fish, seabirds and marine mammals, are present in upper water layers in the Arctic throughout the year, and recent research has demonstrated that bioactivity during the Arctic winter is higher than previously assumed. Information on the seasonal presence/absence of less resilient VEC's such as marine mammals and sea birds in combination with the presence/absence of sea ice seems to be especially crucial to consider in a NEBA. In addition, quantification of the potential impact of different, realistic spill sizes on the energy cascade following the spring bloom at the ice edge would provide important information for assessing ecosystem effects.",,,,,,,,,10,0,0,0,7,0,12,,,0141-1136,1879-0291,,,,,,,,,,"Akvaplan Niva AS, Fram Ctr, Hjalmar Johansens Gate 14, N-9007 Tromso, NorwayUiT Arctic Univ Tromso, Dept Geol, ARCEx Res Ctr Arctic Petr Explorat, Dramsveien 201,Postboks 6050 Langnes, N-9037 Tromso, NorwayInst Marine Res, N-9294 Tromso, NorwayArctic Univ Norway, Univ Tromso, Dept Arctic & Marine Biol, N-9037 Tromso, NorwayAkvaplan Niva AS, Gaustadalleen 21, N-0349 Oslo, Norway",,,,2018-12-28,WOS:000450376700028,30249455,

At all fields oil-based drilling mud was used. The purpose of this study was to investigate contamination gradients, assess effects on benthic fauna both spatially and temporally and to evaluate measures such as diversity indices, indicator species and multivariate analysis techniques in assessment of pollution. Results from analyses of baseline surveys of environmental variables and fauna were characterised by a lack of distinct gradients in station placement, having a typical shot-gun pattern in PCA-, DCA- and MDS-ordination analyses. Likewise there was no consistency in which environmental variables correlated with the fauna. Contamination was assessed using all the physical and chemical data in classification and PCA-ordination analyses. Clear patterns were found using 4 categories, conveniently termed initial, moderate, severe and gross. The categories were usually apparent as rings radiating from the platform. Initial contamination of the outermost areas at most fields was shown as elevated levels of barium and total hydrocarbons (THC) and sometimes also by elevated levels of zinc, copper, cadmium and lead. Three fields were studied in particular and showed contaminated areas of over 100 km(2) (Valhall), over 15 km(2) (Gyda) and over 10 km(2) (Veslefrikk). After a period of 6 to 9 yr contamination had spread, so that nearly all of the outermost stations 2 to 6 km away from the platforms showed evidence of contamination. Thus, the existing sampling design is no longer suitable for assessment of the area contaminated. Effects on the fauna showed, as with contamination, 4 categories. Analyses linking fauna and environmental variables indicated that the effects were mainly related to THC, barium and strontium, but also to metals Like zinc, copper, cadmium and lead, which are all discharged in drill-cuttings. Effects on the fauna closely followed the patterns of contamination with only a few stations at each field that were contaminated not showing effects. Thus the areas showing effects were only slightly less than the areas contaminated. Subsequent to cessation of discharges biodegradation of oil and reduced concentrations of THC were observed. Yet there was an extension of areas where the fauna was affected several years after cessation of drill-cutting discharges. This may indicate that barite and related compounds associated with the discharges also have an environmental impact. However, preliminary results from fields using only water-based mud clearly indicate a reduction in environmental contamination and biological impact, compared to effects reported here, for oil-based drill-cuttings. Diversity indices applied to the data did not show the extent of effects and such indices alone should not be used to interpret changes. The consistent patterns that the multivariate techniques were able to detect showed that these methods were far superior. Analyses of the initial effects on the fauna showed that there were no consistent patterns in changes in species composition over fields or time, and thus the search for 'universal' sensitive indicator species does not seem to be rewarding. Yet under gross effects of pollution there were consistent patterns with the same species dominating.Finally, the initial effects of pollution included severe reductions in organisms that are key components of the benthic communities and also food for bottom-living fish, and are thus ecologically important.The new fauna which establishes in the contaminated sediments close to platforms, often with high abundance, will probably be less valuable as a food source for fish populations since it is of small size and lives sub-surface.",,,,,,,,,211,2,0,0,106,3,229,,,0171-8630,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1995-06-01,WOS:A1995RH67200025,,

Scientific findings over the last decade have strengthened this fact and further supported the identification of cold-water corals habitats as sites of conservation interest and high vulnerability. Given the semi-enclosed nature of the Mediterranean basin and the significant anthropogenic pressure on its ecosystems, most, cold-water corals species have been listed as threatened as they are found at areas which are frequently the focus of resource exploitation (e.g. deep-sea fisheries, oil and gas prospections among others) or are affected directly by other human activities (e.g. marine debris, pollution events) as well as by the increasing impacts of climate change including ocean acidification. Nowadays, conservation and protection of such important species and ecosystems largely depend upon the proper development and implementation of marine policies. Here, we analyze the most important policy framework in place to protect these species in the Mediterranean Sea and we consider the most recent developments and opportunities for improving the situation. The management of cold-water corals involves important challenges. This is partly due to their remote location, limited political awareness, as well as incomplete information available on the occurrence, distribution and resilience of these cold-water coral species and their associated fauna, to impacts and disturbances.

Restoration practices, such as outplanting coral colonies onto degraded reefs, are increasingly used to revive reef ecosystems to preserve fisheries, tourism, and ecosystem functions, which are currently valued at $375 billion globally. However, few studies have examined whether coral restoration and the consequent addition of structural complexity can restore reef ecosystems. Thus, this study aims to better understand early fish community dynamics following restoration using Acropora cervicornis, a major reef building coral and focus species for restoration that has experienced a greater than 80% drop in cover since 1980. To examine fish dynamics after restoration, surveys of fish, environmental conditions, benthic seafloor characteristics, and rugosity were conducted on outplanted plots and control plots without outplants. Surveys were conducted off the north shore of St. Croix, USVI ( 17 degrees 46'15.0 '' N, 64 degrees 49'03.8 '' W) from May 30, 2016 to August 4, 2016, and on December 28, 2016, and January 4, 2017.

Furthermore, we estimate daily consumption rates using two mussel species commonly found on local rocky outcrops and artificial reefs. R. venosa gastropods (n = 21; shell height (SH), 45-117 mm) were obtained by trawling in the Rio de la Plata, and were kept in controlled laboratory settings. To describe its feeding behavior, 10 potential prey species were offered to the gastropods, including Mactra isabelleana, Erodona mactroides, Pitar rostratus, Donax hanleyanus, Mesodesma mactroides, Mytilus platensis, Brachidontes rodriguezi, Mytella charruana, Amiantis purpurata, and Crassostrea gigas. All prey species were consumed. The empty shells left after consumption frequently showed broken shells and rasp signatures on the edges, suggesting a prey attack by marginal chipping or a similar mechanism. This common pattern was not observed in A. purpurata or C. gigas. To explore potential effects of size on feeding behavior, the gastropods were separated into three size classes and offered M. platensis, B. rodriguezi, and M. charruana mussels. Small, intermediate, and large gastropods (SH <60 mm, 60-90 mm, and >90 mm, respectively) consumed comparable mussel size ranges. Small gastropods fed on prey sizes up to 30% larger than their size, whereas large gastropods consumed the largest mussel offered (SH, 78 mm). To estimate daily consumption rates, the 21 gastropods were fed with M. platensis and B. rodriguezi in individual tanks for 12 days. They ate 1.45 +/- 0.67 SD mussels and 0.68 +/- 10.65 g/day per gastropod. The proportion of tissue wet weight consumed did not change with prey species, but varied among the size classes of R. venosa. Small (<60 mm) and intermediate (60-90 mm) gastropods consumed a similar proportion of prey tissue (up to 12% of their tissue wet weight). In contrast, large gastropods (>90 mm) ate up to 5% of their tissue wet weight. This work is the first report of R. venosa feeding behavior and daily consumption rates in Argentina.

Due to their accessibility, shelf seas are commercially and economically important, with oil and gas extraction alone in UK shelf seas valued at £37B pa. Despite occupying only 7% of the surface ocean, shelf seas also play a major role in the global carbon cycle and marine ecosystem. Shelf seas are 3-4 times more productive than open-ocean, are estimated to support more than 40% of carbon sequestration and support 90% of global fish catches providing a critical food source for growing coastal populations. However, shelf seas are also exposed to climate driven and anthropogenic stress that could have a profound impact on their biological productivity, oxygen dynamics and ecosystem function. Many processes contributing to this threat are related to regions that undergo vertical stratification. This process occurs when the bottom layer of shelf seas becomes detached from the atmospherically ventilated near surface layer. In temperate shelf seas stratification predominantly occurs as solar heating outcompetes the tide and wind-driven mixing to produce a warm surface layer, resulting in seasonal stratification over large areas of the NW European shelf seas. A combination of physical detachment from the surface and increased biological oxygen consumption in the bottom layer, accentuated by the enhanced productivity that stratification also supports in the upper ocean, can result in a drastically reduced bottom layer oxygen concentration. When oxygen levels get so low, they are classified as being oxygen deficient and this can be problematic for benthic and pelagic marine organisms and have a detrimental effect on ecosystem function. Evidence of increasing seasonal oxygen deficiency in the regions of North Sea by members of the AlterEco team and a recognised global increase in the extent of shelf sea and coastal oxygen deficiency calls for an urgent need to increase the spatial and temporal measurement of oxygen and a better understanding of the processes that lead to oxygen deficiency in shelf sea bottom waters. This need is severely impeded by the natural complexity of ecosystem functioning, the impact of a changing climate, connectivity between different regions of our shelf seas and large-scale external forcing from ocean and atmosphere. Current methods are severely restricted in resolving this complexity, due to the poor resolution in observational coverage, which calls for a new strategy for observing and monitoring marine ecosystem and environmental status.AlterEco seeks to address this challenge within the framework of the given call by the development of a novel monitoring framework to deliver improved understanding of key shelf sea ecosystem drivers. We will capitalise on recent UK investments in marine autonomous vehicles and planning capability to investigate an area of the North Sea known to undergo variable physical, chemical and biological conditions throughout an entire seasonal cycle, including areas identified to experience low bottom layer oxygen levels during summer months. Ocean gliders will be used to undertake repeat transects over a distance of ~150km, sufficient to capture important shelf sea features; such as fronts and eddies. The AlterEco strategy will employ small fleets of vehicles to capture these meso-scale features (typically ~100km in scale) but will also resolve sub-mesoscale variability (~100m). We will benefit from successes and lessons learnt from recent, pioneering deployments of underwater gliders and use a suite of sensors that permit high-resolution coincident measurements of key ecosystem indicators.

The species characteristics investigated included mobility on the reef, activity within the trap, gregariousness, and capacity for squeezing through mesh. The catchability of the study species varied considerably. Long term mobility was positively correlated with ingress and catchability, indicating that more mobile species are more likely to encounter and hence enter traps. No other effects of species-specific characteristics on catchability were detected. The presence of prey in traps increased the catchability of piscivores by lowering piscivore escapement, and the presence of piscivores in traps decreased the catchability of prey by lowering prey ingress, but the effects were weak in both cases. Catchability was negatively correlated with the percent reef cover of the substratum and with substratum rugosity, suggesting that Craps are more attractive to fish in areas of low habitat complexity.

Using a marker gene and morphological approach, we present an intensive evaluation of microbial eukaryote communities prior to and following oiling around heavily impacted shorelines. Our results show significant changes in community structure, with pre-spill assemblages of diverse Metazoa giving way to dominant fungal communities in post-spill sediments. Post-spill fungal taxa exhibit low richness and are characterized by an abundance of known hydrocarbon-degrading genera, compared to prior communities that contained smaller and more diverse fungal assemblages. Comparative taxonomic data from nematodes further suggests drastic impacts; while pre-spill samples exhibit high richness and evenness of genera, post-spill communities contain mainly predatory and scavenger taxa alongside an abundance of juveniles.

Due to their accessibility, shelf seas are commercially and economically important, with oil and gas extraction alone in UK shelf seas valued at £37B pa. Despite occupying only 7% of the surface ocean, shelf seas also play a major role in the global carbon cycle and marine ecosystem. Shelf seas are 3-4 times more productive than open-ocean, are estimated to support more than 40% of carbon sequestration and support 90% of global fish catches providing a critical food source for growing coastal populations. However, shelf seas are also exposed to climate driven and anthropogenic stress that could have a profound impact on their biological productivity, oxygen dynamics and ecosystem function. Many processes contributing to this threat are related to regions that undergo vertical stratification. This process occurs when the bottom layer of shelf seas becomes detached from the atmospherically ventilated near surface layer. In temperate shelf seas stratification predominantly occurs as solar heating outcompetes the tide and wind-driven mixing to produce a warm surface layer, resulting in seasonal stratification over large areas of the NW European shelf seas. A combination of physical detachment from the surface and increased biological oxygen consumption in the bottom layer, accentuated by the enhanced productivity that stratification also supports in the upper ocean, can result in a drastically reduced bottom layer oxygen concentration.

Managing them well is vital to human well-being as well as the maintenance of marine biodiversity and ocean-dependent economies. Carbon sequestration and storage is increasingly recognized as a valuable service provided by coastal vegetation. Carbon sequestered and stored by mangrove forests, tidal marshes, and seagrass meadows is known as blue' carbon. These habitats capture and store carbon within the plants themselves and in the sediment below them. When the habitats are destroyed, much of their carbon is released back to the atmosphere and ocean contributing to global climate change. Therefore, blue carbon ecosystem protection is becoming a greater priority in marine management and is an area of interest to scientists, policy makers, coastal communities, and the private sector including those that contribute to ecosystem degradation but also those that are looking to reduce their carbon footprint. A range of policy and management responses aim to reduce coastal ecosystem loss, including the establishment of marine protected areas (MPAs). This paper explores how MPA design, location, and management could be used to protect and increase carbon sequestration and ensure integrity of carbon storage through conservation and restoration activities. While additional research is necessary to validate the proposed recommendations, this paper describes much needed first steps and highlights the potential for blue carbon finance mechanisms to provide sustainable funding for MPAs.",,,,,Hawaii World Conservation CongressHawaii World Conservation Congress,"SEP, 2016SEP, 2016","IUCN; World Commiss Protected Areas; U S Dept Commerce, Natl Ocean & Atmospher Adm; Natl Marine Sanctuaries; Agence Aires Marines Protegees; Partenariat France UICN, Nat DevIUCN; World Commiss Protected Areas; U S Dept Commerce, Natl Ocean & Atmospher Adm; Natl Marine Sanctuaries; Agence Aires Marines Protegees; Partenariat France UICN, Nat Dev","Honolulu, HIHonolulu, HI",54,2,0,0,25,0,56,,,1052-7613,1099-0755,,,,,,,,,,"Conservat Int, Arlington, VA 22202 USANature Conservancy, Arlington, VA USAUniv Melbourne, Melbourne, Vic, AustraliaUS Natl Ocean & Atmospher Adm, Washington, DC USAMonterey Bay Aquarium, Monterey, CA USA",,,,2017-09-25,WOS:000409848000009,,

The reef consists of 50 tons of blocks (each 40 x 20 x 20 cm) formed into eight conical units, each 1 m high by 4 m across on an area of seabed 30 m x 10 m. The reef lies on a fiat sandy seabed (10 m below chart datum) 3 km distant from natural rocky outcrops. The eight units represent three different PFA/gypsum mixes, each replicated, and two concrete controls. Colonization by epibiota was monitored using direct observation and photographic recording of block surfaces. Analysis of the results using CLUSTAN 3/PC clustering software did not reveal any differences in the biota colonizing the three PFA/gypsum mixes or between the colonizers of the PFA/gypsum mixes and the concrete controls. Epibiota showed seasonal variations in abundance throughout the year overlain with a progression in the numbers of species present and a maturation of the population towards the epibiotic populations seen on local natural reefs. Adult lobsters (Homarus gammarus) and crabs (Cancer pagurus) from the local natural reefs were recruited to the reef within 3 weeks. Acoustic and conventional tagging studies revealed that some lobsters showed considerable site loyalty, with recorded residence time of 368 days. The most numerous shoaling fish congregating around the reef units has been the pouting, Trisopterus luscus, a small gadoid. Shoal size was commonly estimated at around 200 individuals per reef unit. Summer biomass estimates of pouting wet weight, using published weight to length conversions, were 207-1572 kg.ha(-1) in the vicinity of any one of the eight reef units. Several species using the reef were observed to be reproducing there. These include corkwing wrasse (Crenilabrus melops), lobster (Homarus gammarus), spiny spider crabs (Maja squinado), velvet swimming crab (Liocarcinus puber), hermit crabs (Pagurus bernhardus), whelks (Buccinum undatum) and the nudibranch (Archidoris pseudoargus). Assessment of infauna suggests that the infaunal population in the vicinity of the reef was not overtly affected by the presence of the reef.

The objective of this study is to develop a wave-phase-resolved numerical capability for the simulation of wind-waves under moderate sea conditions, to investigate the interaction between the wind and waves, to effectively capture the effect of wave breaking dissipation in the wave simulation, and to perform simulation-based study of the dynamic evolution of wind-waves. The study aims at establishing a framework for physics-based fine-resolution simulation of wind-waves that can be used by theoretical, numerical, and experimental studies for model development and cross comparison. The simulation builds on a suite of advanced numerical methods including a high-order spectral method (HOSM) for nonlinear waves, large-eddy simulation (LES) with advanced subgrid-scale (SGS) models for wind turbulence on boundary-fitted grid that follows the wave motion, and, as an auxiliary tool, a hybrid multi-fluid simulation (HMFS) method for steep and breaking waves. The wind simulation will be dynamically coupled with the wave simulation with two-way interactions. From the HOSM simulation, the wave field will provide a realistic bottom boundary condition for the wind LES. Using a new dynamic SGS sea-surface roughness model, the effect of short gravity waves on the wind will be modeled without ad hoc tuning of the model coefficient. In return, the wind LES will provide wind forcing for the HOSM simulation of the waves. Using wave breaking models, which will be assessed and calibrated with the auxiliary HMFS of steep and breaking waves, wave breaking dissipation will also be taken into account in the HOSM. As such, the processes of wind input, nonlinear wave interaction, and wave breaking dissipation will all be incorporated to the phase-resolved simulation of the wave field for the first time. Systematic tests and extensive comparisons with other studies are planned in the proposed project. Some of the proposed computations, such as the wind LES over dynamically-evolving nonlinear wave field with dynamic SGS sea-surface roughness modeling, the phase-resolved simulation of nonlinear wave field with direct wind input and modeling of wave breaking dissipation, and the simulation of steep and breaking wind-waves, are the first of their kind. This study will produce detailed data of the interacting wind and wave fields in a wave-phase-resolved context, which can shed new light on the long- standing problem of wind-wave dynamics. The results of the proposed research will be useful for the comparison with experiment measurement and theoretical analysis. The simulation data will also be helpful for the development of improved models for large-scale wave-phase-averaged simulations. Broader impacts: The topic of this study is of interest to the scientific community as well as the general public. The proposed study will lead to improved simulation capability and understanding of wind-waves, which are essential to many applications including weather and climate change, operation and safety of ships and offshore structures, renewable energy, and pollutant transport. In the project, doctoral graduate education will stress multi-disciplinary training with a focus on computation of wave and turbulence problems. Graduate student recruiting and mentoring will leverage an NSF IGERT project on modeling complex systems awarded to JHU. The IGERT project places emphasis on training in high-performance computation of multi-scale multi-physics problems for domestic doctoral students, especially under-represented minorities, women, and first-generation students. Educational outreach will be facilitated by the Center for Educational Outreach at JHU, through which the PI will work with local Baltimore high schools to expose high school students, especially those from underserved communities, to university research and to inspire them to pursue higher education and careers in science and engineering.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,1155638,,,,,,,,Johns Hopkins University,,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:13939840,,

However, the levels of petroleum hydrocarbons in the most heavily contaminated sediments were sufficiently high to have eliminated sensitive groups such as the Amphipoda and encourage species associated with oil pollution, but the overall numbers of species involved and their abundances were too small to significantly affect community structure. There is no evidence from the analysis of species abundance distributions that mass mortality of the benthos took place at any time after the Braer oil spill, although there are indications that a few species may have been eliminated and were recruiting at the time of the survey.

Major contributors to this are the current push for offshore renewable energy sources, which are thought of as environmentally friendly sources of power, as well as the continued demand for petroleum. Human disturbances, including the noise almost ubiquitously associated with human activity, are likely to increase the incidence, magnitude, and duration of adverse effects on marine life, including stress responses. Stress responses have the potential to induce fitness consequences for individuals, which add to more obvious directed takes (e.g., hunting or fishing) to increase the overall population-level impact. To meet the requirements of marine spatial planning and ecosystem-based management, many efforts are ongoing to quantify the cumulative impacts of all human actions on marine species or populations. Meanwhile, regulators face the challenge of managing these accumulating and interacting impacts with limited scientific guidance. We believe there is scientific support for capping the level of impact for (at a minimum) populations in decline or with unknown statuses. This cap on impact can be facilitated through implementation of regular application cycles for project authorization or improved programmatic and aggregated impact assessments that simultaneously consider multiple projects. Cross-company collaborations and a better incorporation of uncertainty into decision making could also help limit, if not reduce, cumulative impacts of multiple human activities. These simple management steps may also form the basis of a rudimentary form of marine spatial planning and could be used in support of future ecosystem-based management efforts.",,,,,,,,,22,0,0,0,18,0,22,,,0888-8892,1523-1739,,,,,,,,,,"George Mason Univ, Dept Environm Sci & Policy, Fairfax, VA 22030 USAAarhus Univ, Dept Biosci, DK-4000 Roskilde, Denmark",,,,2015-04-15,WOS:000351353400004,25439093,

These results differed from all the other studies in the three areas due to the co-dominance of Ctenosciaena gracilicirrhus and Stephanolepis hispidus. Such spatial similarity shows the low influence of the Orion reef in the area after three years. Biomass values were 15% higher in the Orion reef area than in the control areas, representing an increase of up to 1.2 times in wet weight. The increment of fish communities is still insufficient for proposing sustainable fishery activity in the shipwreck area. The monitoring time (32 months) after the sinking of the Orion may be considered too short to assure that the wreckage had reached its maturity as an artificial reef, either as a fish attractor or producer.",,,,,,,,,4,0,0,0,5,0,5,,,0718-560X,0717-7178,,,,,,,,,,"Inst Estudos Mar Almirante Paulo Moreira, Dept Oceanog, BR-28930000 Arraial Do Cabo, RJ, BrazilUniv Estadual do Norte Fluminense, BR-28013602 Campos Dos Goytacazes, RJ, Brazil",Inst Estudos Mar Almirante Paulo MoreiraUniv Estadual do Norte Fluminense,,,2011-03-26,WOS:000288178700010,,

However, this reservoir of natural, free, and sustainable carbon storage potential is increasingly jeopardized by alarming trends in coastal habitat loss, totalling 30-50% of global abundance over the last century alone. Human intervention to restore lost habitats is a potentially powerful solution to improve natural rates of global CCS, but data suggest this approach is unlikely to substantially improve long-term CCS unless current restoration efforts are increased to an industrial scale.

The PRC runs parallel to the shelf edge and consists of many narrow, turbid channels where strong tidal currents and eddies foster high suspended loads and phytoplankton production that sustain lush gardens of suspension-feeding, benthic communities. Rates and pathways of benthic carbon decomposition and carbonate kinetics in relation to these characteristics were measured across the shelf. Flux rates of DIC, O-2, Mn, and dissolved inorganic nutrients across the sediment-water interface were rapid, increasing from inshore and peaking at the channels within the PRC. Rates of DIC (mean: 39.5 mmol m(-2) d(-1); range: 14.5-103.2) and NH4+ production (mean =5.4 mmol m(-2) d(-1); range=1.6-23.7) from incubated sediments were rapid compared with other shelves. Sulfate reduction (mean:1.2 mmol S m(-2) d(-1); range: 0.1-6.1) and iron reduction (mean: 2.7 mmol Fe m(-2) d(-1); range: 0.6-4.6) were minor diagenetic pathways, measured only in inshore and mid-shelf deposits. Manganese reduction (mean: 12.5 mmol Mn m(-2) d(-1); range: 0.5-55.9) was the second most important pathway, as sites seaward of the inner shelf were dominated by aerobic respiration (63-99% of total C oxidation). There was no detectable production of either CH4 or N2O. Rates of O-2 consumption were rapid (mean: 44.6 mmol m(-2) d(-1); range: 10.2-121.9) with the percentage of O-2 involved in chemical oxidation declining from 90% to 92% inshore to <10% at the shelf edge. From inshore to the mid-shelf reefs, approximate to 20% of remineralized DIC was involved in carbonate dissolution whereas approximate to 10% was involved in authigenic mineral formation on the outer shelf and at the shelf edge. N-2 production was rapid and much greater than nitrogen fixation but neither showed across-shelf patterns. High tidal energy within the PRC leads to increased exposure of high-quality organic matter to microbes and oxygen, fostering rapid rates of aerobic respiration, manganese reduction, and carbonate dissolution. Our data supports the notion that tropical shelves act as efficient 'incinerators' of organic matter. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

To investigate these mechanisms, we have used benthic foraminiferal B/Ca to reconstruct deep-water [CO32-] in cores from the deep Indian and Equatorial Pacific Oceans during the past five glacial cycles. Based on our reconstructions, we suggest that the shelf-to-basin shift of carbonate deposition raised deep-water [CO32-], on average, by 7.3 +/- 0.5 (SE) mu mol/kg during glaciations. Oceanic carbon reorganisations during major climatic transitions caused deep-water [CO32-] deviations away from the long-term trend, and carbonate compensation processes subsequently acted to restore the ocean carbonate system to new steady state conditions. Deep-water [CO32-] showed similar patterns to sediment carbonate content (%CaCO3) records on glacial-interglacial timescales, suggesting that past seafloor %CaCO3 variations were dominated by deep-water carbonate preservation changes at our studied sites.

Because these services are of high economic, social and cultural value, the management and protection of blue carbon ecosystems could build collaboration between climate change and biodiversity practitioners on the national and international level. Such collaboration would also allow for the transfer of lessons learned from coastal management and conservation activities to carbon mitigation projects, and would include the need to work closely together with indigenous peoples and local communities.

Leg One of this mission, lasting from August 29 to September 7, visited the Oculina Bank, situated 30 km (18 mi) east of the northern Florida coast. Oculina Bank was the first deep-water site in federal waters off the U.S. Eastern Seaboard to be closed to fishing. Once, this area was covered with dense thickets of the ivory tree coral, Oculina varicosa, which provided excellent habitat for reef fish, such as grouper and wreckfish, and feeding grounds for migratory pelagic (deep-sea) species. However, fishing activities destroyed approximately two-thirds of the bank. A fragile and slow-growing coral, deep-water Oculina only grows about one--half inch per year. These and other damaged coral reefs will take many years, even decades, to recover. To aid in the recovery process, a significant portion of the area was closed to fishing in 1994. NOAA has since funded efforts to assess the banks and to attempt to restore the damaged areas. In July 2000, the National Marine Fisheries Service approved plans to expand the protected area, with the goal of saving the remaining ivory tree coral. Much of the protected area is deeper than 100 m (328 ft), rugged, and can only be studied using advanced undersea technologies. The mission will use the HBOI submersible Clelia and an ROV to study the recovery of the reserve. In addition to habitat characterization work, visual observations of artificial-reef restoration structures deployed on the banks beginning in 1995 will help to determine species' rates of recruitment.

Submerged steel structures, including shipwrecks, serve as artificial reefs and become hotspots of biodiversity in the deep sea. Marine biofilms on submerged structures support settlement of micro- and macro-biota and may enhance and protect against corrosion. Disruptions in the local environment, including oil spills, may impact the role that biofilms play in reef preservation. To determine how the Deepwater Horizon spill potentially impacted shipwreck biofilms and the functional roles of the biofilm microbiome, experiments containing carbon steels disks (CSDs) were placed at five historic shipwreck sites located within, and external to the benthic footprint of the Deepwater Horizon spill. The CSDs were incubated for 16 weeks to enable colonization by biofilm-forming microorganisms and to provide time for in situ corrosion to occur. Biofilms from the CSDs, as well as sediment and water microbiomes, were collected and analyzed by 16S rRNA amplicon gene sequencing to describe community composition and determine the source of taxa colonizing biofilms. Biofilm metagenomes were sequenced to compare differential gene abundances at spill-impacted and reference sites. Biofilms were dominated by Zeta-, Alpha-, Epsilon-, and Gamma-proteobacteria. Sequences affiliated with the Mariprofundus and Sulfurimonas genera were prolific, and Roseobacter, and Colwellia genera were also abundant. Analysis of 16S rRNA sequences from sediment, water, and biofilms revealed sediment to be the main known source of taxa to biofilms at impacted sites. Differential gene abundance analysis revealed the two-component response regulator CreC, a gene involved in environmental stress response, to be elevated at reference sites compared to impacted sites within the spill plume fallout area on the seafloor. Genes for chemotaxis, motility, and alcohol dehydrogenases were differentially abundant at reference vs. impacted sites. Metal loss on CSDs was elevated at sites within the spill fallout plume. Time series images reveal that metal loss at a heavily impacted site, the German Submarine U-166, has accelerated since the spill in 2010.

However, tomaintain this push towards green energy providers will need to find more sites to generate power. In recent years therehave been moves towards using offshore wind generation instead of onshore wind farms. Whilst offshore wind has manyadvantages there is potential impact on marine wildlife that needs to be considered. New applications for offshore windfarmsites require a thorough Environmental Impact Assessment and the offshore environment makes it hard to accuratelyassess current marine populations, making this a time-consuming and costly operation.In this research we propose to develop a real-time acoustic monitoring platform that will enable operators to assess a sitefor marine mammal activity at a fraction of the current cost and effort and moreover, produce better and more accurateresults. This will be done by deploying large numbers of novel low cost, low power underwater wireless sensor devices(NanoPAMs) which detect the sounds that marine mammals make to navigate, hunt and communicate. The data from eachNanoPAM is transmitted using acoustic signals over distances up to 10 km to a surface buoy. Since the animals may beable to hear these acoustic signals, the NanoPAMs transmit very low energy acoustic signals which blend into thebackground noise and are also smart enough to wait until animals have left the area before transmitting so as not toinfluence behaviour.

It is a priority habitat within the UK Biodiversity Action Plan and as a biogenic reef forming species is covered by Annex 1 of the EC habitats directive. S. alveolata has a lusitanean (southern) distribution, being largely restricted to the south and west coasts of England. A broad-scale survey of S. alveolata distribution along the north-west coasts was undertaken in 2003/2004. These records were then compared with previous distribution records, mainly those collected by Cunningham in 1984. More detailed mapping was carried out at Hilbre Island at the mouth of the River Dee, due to recent reports that S. alveolata had become re-established there after a long absence. Surveys The broad-scale survey showed S. alveolata to have appeared at new sites, as well as increasing in abundance at many sites where it had previously been recorded. On Hilbre, S. alveolata was found to be well established, with colonies on the northeast, north and southwest side of Hilbre and Little Hilbre Islands. On the northeast side, S. alveolata formed a patchy sheet reef whereas on the north and southwest sides it tended to be found more often as hummocks. The faunal community associated with S. alveolata at Hilbre was found to be impoverished. Overview Data from the Marine Biodiversity and Climate Change Project (MarClim), used in conjunction with new data collected as part of the broad-scale survey, can be compared with past data in order to examine changes in distribution. Although the geographic range of S. alveolata is fairly stable, there is a degree of fluctuation in distribution and abundance within this range. Recent increases in abundance and the establishment of S. alveolata in new areas may indicate the effect of climate change: Potential influencing factors include milder winters and increases in sediment supply as a result of increased storminess. Artificial habitat such as sea defence structures also plays a crucial role as it enables the establishment of S. alveolata in areas where it would have previously been excluded due to lack of suitable substrate. This artificial habitat has been present for some time before the establishment of new S. alveolata colonies, however, and it is likely that water quality amelioration which is a more recent phenomenon is the other factor influencing the establishment of S. alveolata in these areas. Activity Report Broad-scale mapping - The MarClim team (Nova Mieszkowska, Jain Bennet) undertook a survey in North Wales in August 2003. A further visit to North Wales and North West England was made in December 2003 and Dr Matthew Frost and Jefferson Murua completed the survey of North West England in March 2004. In addition, other MarClim data entries were used and sites sampled by Cunningham et al. (1984) revisited. Detailed mapping - A visit to Hilbre Island and the Wirral foreshore was made by Prof SJ Hawkins and Dr P Moschella in August 2003. This included briefing the local contact (Mrs Christine Smyth) on resurvey methods. Christine Smyth started mapping the Wirral Sabellaria alveolata beds in liaison with the Warden at Hilbre Island. Dr Matthew Frost and Christine Smyth completed this mapping in March 2004. General Introduction Background The honeycomb reef worm Sabellaria alveolata is recognised as being an important component of intertidal communities (Holt et al., 1998). Historically, there has been a great deal of research into its ecology. Much of the early research in the UK was carried out by Douglas Wilson from the Marine Biological Association who investigated the ecology of S. alveolata larvae (Wilson, 1929; Wilson, 1968a; Wilson, 1968b; Wilson, 1970) as well as studying its long term growth and distribution patterns at a site at Duckpool in North Cornwall (Wilson, 1971; Wilson, 1974; Wilson 1976). The ability of S. alveolata to form extensive reefs means that it also constitutes an unusual habitat that can have an associated rich fauna (Gruet, 1982) and its role as a 'bioconstructor' has more recently begun to generate interest from biogeomorphologists (Naylor & Viles, 2000). The restricted distribution of S. alveolata in the UK where it is at the northern end of its range, along with its vulnerability to disturbance has led to its inclusion as a priority habitat within the UK Biodiversity Action Plan. Biogenic reefs were also selected as one of the sub features of the marine habitats listed in Annex 1 of the Europeans Union's Council Directive 92/43/EEC on the conservation of natural habitats and of wild fauna and flora (Habitats Directive). A report on the dynamics and sensitivity of biogenic reefs for the UK marine SACs project identified S. alveolata as one of the most important biogenic reef forming species in inshore British Waters (Holt et al., 1998). Although having a Lusitanean distribution in the UK, S. alveolata is generally restricted to the south and West coasts of England (Bamber & Irving, 1997). It does, however, extend reasonably far north along the West coast of the UK, being reliably. recorded as far north as the outer Solway Firth (Cunningham et al., 1984). Overall, however, the S. alveolata biotope is considered rare in the UK as it covers less than 0.5 % of the total UK coastline (Sanderson, 1996). Aims The aims of the present report are as follows: a) Broad-scale survey - To map the present distribution and abundance of S. alveolata from The Great Orme (Anglesey) to St. Bees on the Cumbrian coast and compare this with previous records of its distribution. b) Detailed mapping - To detail the extent, abundance and type of S. alveolata growth on Hilbre Island at the mouth of the River Dee, including details of the associated community. c) Overview - To place all of the information gathered for this report into a spatial and historical context and discuss the role of potential influences on S. alveolata distribution. Study Area The area studied as part of the investigation into the broad-scale distribution of S. alveolata stretched from Great Orme, North Wales and included the area northwards as far as St Bees Head on the Cumbrian coast of England (on the eastern side of the Irish Sea Basin). This stretch of coast therefore occurs within the OSPAR Celtic Seas region (Weighell et al., 2000). The physical processes in the Irish Sea are dominated by the large tidal range, which increases from west to east with Liverpool Bay having an average tidal range of 8.4 m (Taylor & Parker, 1993). Within the above area, a more detailed mapping exercise was carried out at Hilbre Island, Little Hilbre Island and Little Eye which form the Hilbre Islands group. These three tidal islands occur at the mouth of the Dee Estuary and constitute one of the few rocky areas in Liverpool Bay; they have therefore been fairly intensively sampled over the years (Mills, 1998). The Hilbre Island group has been designated a local nature reserve and a SSSI.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,0260-2784,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2004-01-01,ZOOREC:ZOOR14209057940,,

Diversity measures and community structure analyses indicate a healthy status of polychaete communities. The BOPA index reveals that oil sensitive amphipods were recolonized in the study area. This confirms that the benthic communities of the oil spill impacted area had taken only <14 years to recover in the open waters of the impacted areas. The study also reveals the existence of three distinct polychaete communities along the depth and sediment gradients. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

The gear is expected to have a high impact on the entire benthic community, mainly on epifauna and organisms living in the upper sediment layers. To obtain information on likely medium- to long-term effects of trawl fishing in the northern Adriatic Sea, an experiment on immediate/short-term effects was carried out in an undisturbed sandy area near a wreck. The rapido produced flat tracks on the bottom that were still clearly visible after a week by means of sidescan sonar. The trawl did not change the sediment grain size, although it did disturb the upper 6 cm of sediment. Experimental trawling induced a modification in the macrobenthic community that was most evident immediately after the haul. Changes to the meiobenthic community were probably due to sediment disturbance and were recorded after 1 week. Comparison between an undisturbed control area and a neighbouring commercially exploited area allowed some evaluation of long-term changes in the benthic community.

We examined relationships between the recruitment of three species of damselfish (Pomacentrus moluccensis Bleeker, P. wardi Whitley and P. amboinensis Bleeker) and microhabitat structure (composition of the substrata) across six broad habitat zones at Heron Reef. Comparison of the distribution of recruits with the availability of substratum types along 10 x 2-m belt transects indicated that recruits of all three species utilised the substrata non-randomly. However, despite the distinct patterns of microhabitat use exhibited by each species, relationships between the density of recruits and the availability of preferred substrata were poor. We suggest that spatial stochasticity in larval supply and/or post-settlement mortality weakens relationships between recruitment and microhabitat availability. Univariate and multivariate analyses indicated significant differences in the recruitment of each species and in overall recruitment among habitat zones, and these differences may reflect large-scale variation in larval supply and/or rates of post-settlement mortality. Based on combined recruitment data, there was little evidence to suggest that areas of patchy coral reef received more or less recruitment than comparable areas of contiguous reef. Furthermore, recruitment to lagoonal patch reefs did not differ from recruitment to nearby sections of the reef slope offering a similar habitat with respect to depth and characteristics of the substratum.

Yet, there has been little empirical evidence in natural ecosystems to support this hypothesis. Here, we use a naturally-occurring trophic cascade to provide evidence that predators help protect sedimentary organic carbon stocks in coral reef ecosystems. Our results show that predation risk altered the behavior of herbivorous fish, whereby it constrained grazing to areas close to the refuge of the patch reefs. Macroalgae growing in riskier areas further away from the reef were released from grazing pressure, which subsequently promoted carbon accumulation in the sediments underlying the macroalgal beds. Here we found that carbon stocks furthest away from the reef edge were similar to 24% higher than stocks closest to the reef. Our results indicate that predators and herbivores play an important role in structuring carbon dynamics in a natural marine ecosystem, highlighting the need to conserve natural predator-prey dynamics to help maintain the crucial role of marine sediments in sequestering carbon.",,,,,,,,,23,0,0,0,20,0,26,,,2296-701X,,,,,,,,,,,"Utah State Univ, Dept Watershed Sci, Logan, UT 84322 USAUtah State Univ, Ctr Ecol, Logan, UT 84322 USAUniv Queensland, Global Change Inst, St Lucia, Qld, AustraliaMacquarie Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Sydney, NSW, AustraliaUniv Hawaii, Hawaii Inst Marine Biol, Manoa, HI USAFlorida Int Univ, Dept Biol Sci, North Miami, FL USAUniv Queensland, Sch Biol Sci, Marine Spatial Ecol Lab, St Lucia, Qld, AustraliaUniv Queensland, Sch Biol Sci, Australian Res Council, Ctr Excellence Coral Reef Studies, St Lucia, Qld, AustraliaUniv Technol Sydney, Sch Environm, Sydney, NSW, AustraliaDeakin Univ, Sch Life & Environm Sci, Ctr Integrat Ecol, Fac Sci Engn & Built Environm, Geelong, Vic, AustraliaUniv Queensland, Sch Geog Planning & Environm Management, Biophys Remote Sensing Grp, St Lucia, Qld, AustraliaUniv Queensland, Sch Biol Sci, St Lucia, Qld, Australia",,,,2018-12-28,WOS:000451795800001,,

Studies conducted worldwide have shown that reefs can be designed to attract specific species of finfish and shellfish. Included in this paper is a comprehensive review of this literature to present which reef design is favorable to enhance commercial fisheries, charter boat sport fishing, or recreational dive tours. Results of this analysis show that a large complex structure such as a decommissioned ship is favorable for divers because it would recruit the highest diversity of species. In terms of increasing population numbers, fishing industries that target bottom-dwelling fish would benefit most from low lying reefs such as assembled from concrete pipes. If water column oriented fish are targeted, a ship or Fish Aggregating Device (FAD), both of which provide high vertical relief, would work best.

Micronekton community structure and biomass differed between the eastern and central regions of the GAB. Regional differences were mainly driven by relatively high abundance of krill (Nematoscelis megalops, Nyctiphanes australis and Euphausia similis) in east GAB and high abundance of Maurolicus australis and chaetognaths in central GAB. Central GAB was also characterised by relatively high abundance of gelatinous zooplankton and small-bodied cephalopods. Lanternfishes were used as a model pelagic group to investigate the bioregional setting of the GAB. The analyses indicated that the oceanic habitats of the GAB had bioregional affinities with the subtropical Indian Ocean. However, over the continental slope, the east GAB had bioregional affinities with the Subtropical Convergence and grouped with western and southern Tasmania and the southern Tasman Sea. Lanternfish assemblage groups were compared against existing regionalisations that are based on physicochemical variables and the Delphi Method. No single existing scheme suitably reflected lanternfish assemblage distributions, but parsimonious boundaries from existing schema were identified.

Two design criteria and a direct comparison between quarry rock and concrete reefs were examined in this 5-yr pilot program. The newly created eelgrass habitat quickly performed at the level of the existing eelgrass bed. The overall analysis found that the mitigation eelgrass habitat was not significantly different from the reference eelgrass habitat in terms of fishes. Neither reef material (quarry rock or concrete rubble) nor original reef design influenced fish utilization. In addition, aspects of fishery enhancement were examined on the enhancement reefs using three target species of Paralabrax (Perciformes: Serranidae).

At the study site, the species mainly inhabits semi-obscure caves. By studying recruitment over one year I first inferred the larval release period for D. hispida and described its temporal occurrence in the communities and stations studied. Secondly, I attempted to determine whether the predicted restricted dispersal may account for the species' distribution at the study site. To this purpose, I compared the distribution of early recruits (15 days old) with that of adults. I also investigated environmental factors which may affect the extent of larval dispersal, and described the effects of post-recruitment processes occurring over a 4-month period. The brooding period, inferred from the study of early recruitment, was linked to spring-increments and autumn-decrements of water temperatures. Early recruits were distributed non-randomly in the communities and stations studied, being most abundant in the habitats where adults live. Strong hydrodynamic events seemed to modify this pattern, allowing recruitment out of the parental communities, and may hinder settlement. Post-recruitment mortality events were likely to prevent colonisation of habitats where the species do not live. Overall, philopatry and low post-recruitment mortality in the parental communities appeared to be the main mechanisms determining the distribution of D. hispida at the study site.",,,,,,,,,13,0,1,0,11,0,15,,,1438-387X,,,,,,,,,,,"Ctr Estudis Avancats Blanes, CACC, Blanes 17300, Spain",,,,2003-03-01,WOS:000182083900007,,

As part of the first research direction of the Project the authors' own nonlinear spectral analysis of intense wave groups will be developed, based on the Inverse Scattering Technique (IST) for the nonlinear Schrödinger equation. The possibilities of its application for three-dimensional fields of irregular waves with a realistic spectrum, the correspondence between the location of such groups and the places of extreme wave occurrence will be determined. This approach will allow a short-term forecast of possible extreme waves without a direct calculation of the equations of hydrodynamics. Typical portraits of extreme waves will be studied following the second research direction of the Project - based on the statistically homogeneous data of numerical simulations of irregular three-dimensional nonlinear waves. This study involves the calculation of the conventional statistical characteristics of the waves (statistical moments, distribution functions) depending on the conditions (parameters of initial JONSWAP spectrum), as well as the analysis of the geometry of extreme waves (first of all, asymmetry) and the lifetimes of such waves. It is planned to perform a study of portraits of the space-time Fourier transforms for irregular three-dimensional nonlinear waves using the method proposed by the authors, which has no analogues. In particular, it is proposed to determine the role of the emerging coherent states of free waves in the occurrence of extreme statistical characteristics of waves. The third direction of the project is focused on the adequate theoretical description of runup of complex sea waves, representing either a group of intense waves or a random wave field, on a beach. From the dynamical point of view, the emphasis will be on the groups of intense waves, including dispersive wave groups. Such groups are often observed in nature and are typical for the conditions of the beginning /end of a storm, when the spectrum contains waves of different periods, as well as for landslide induced tsunami and trans-ocean tsunami, and ship wakes. To describe them, both the classical nonlinear shallow water theory and the nonlinear-dispersive theory within the Boussinesq approximation will be used. As a result the importance of taking into account dispersive effects during long wave runup on the beach will be estimated. The second important problem is the random sea wave statistics on the coast. Previously we calculated the statistical moments of oscillations of the water displacement and velocity of the moving shoreline. In the framework of this Project, we will calculate the probability distribution functions for displacements and velocities of the moving shoreline. This will allow us to estimate the likelihood of anomalously strong coastal flooding. A theoretical study of wave runup processes will be supplemented and verified using laboratory modeling in a hydrodynamic wave tank based in the NSTU n.a. R.E. Alekseev. The modernization and equipping of this installation was carried out with the support of the completed Project 2016. It is equipped with removable shore profiles of different shapes with the ability to install pressure gauges in the profiles, bottom and sides of the wave tank in addition to the registration with wave gauges, and photo and video recording. Waves can be excited either by a programmable wave maker, or by the dam break mechanism. Such equipment should allow for the modeling and measurement of the complex dynamics of the wave runup at the international level. The relevance of the proposed problem is based on several factors. First, the ever-increasing cost of offshore structures, ships, and cargoes carried by them, human lives and the environmental consequences of accidents require an improvement in the methods for predicting hazardous waves. Secondly, in the last 20 years or so, the problem of extreme sea waves (rogue waves, freak waves, killer waves), which arise as a result of nonlinear effects of the wave dynamics and are not taken into account by classical probabilistic theories, has become obvious. The probability of high waves under certain conditions is much higher than expected. Thirdly, right now the understanding of the physics of extreme nonlinear waves, the existing mathematical techniques and the algorithms for the simulation of equations of hydrodynamics, as well as the level of computer performance allow to make the stochastic sea waves predictable. Here we are based on our own developments, modern mathematical methods and numerical codes for calculating the dynamics of sea waves.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,19-17-11007,,,,,,,,Nizhny Novgorod State Technical University n.a.

We observed 10,234 fishes aggregating below the net-cage with a mean annual density of 142 (SE +/- 30) per 100 m(2) and diversity H' 2.29. At the adjacent reference reef, we counted 8452 fishes with a mean annual density of 117 (SE +/- 20) and H' 1.45 and at Reference Reef 2, located 500 m away, there were 8958 fishes with a density of 124 (SE +/- 20) and H' 1.13. The total density of fishes was the same between the study sites (ANOVA; P = 0.24); however, the spatial density of fishes in the water column was different between the net-cage and reference reefs. Additionally, the density of juvenile fish was significantly lower at the net-cage (ANOVA; P = 0.02), while the density of subadult and adult fishes was higher (ANOVA; P = 0.03). Feeding guild analysis ranked the net-cage highest (3507), while Reference Reef 1 (2149), and Reference Reef 2 (2241), had lower values, a relationship often found between artificial and natural reefs. This suggests the importance of available trophic resources to the adult population of wild fishes, and has implications in the artificial reef attraction-production debate.

During the process of drilling an oil well, drill cuttings with various characteristics and sizes are produced. Among the disposal options for drill cuttings, onsite sea disposal of these cuttings is the simplest and the least expensive. However, onsite disposal of these drilling waste materials into the sea from oil platform might have adverse environmental impacts. The larger drill cuttings disposed onsite will deposit onto the seabed to form piles around the vicinity of the platform. These accumulated cuttings on the seabed might harm marine benthic organisms resulting in growth inhibition, mortality, and smothering. Further, it may affect pipe laying and maintenance operations. Besides, the smaller sized drill cuttings may remain in the water column as suspended solids. Model simulations are performed to provide a perspective on the areal extent of accumulations of cuttings on the seabed and to investigate potential mitigation measures if needed. For this purpose, an in-house particle tracking model TUNA-PT has been developed. In this paper, we use TUNA-PT to simulate the pile formation pattern of drill cuttings discharged onsite in the Siakap-North Petai (SNP) Field located offshore of Sabah. The energetic ocean environment of the South China Sea provides strong currents and effective eddy dispersion, resulting in the drill cuttings been widely spread over a large area, thereby decreasing the pile height on the seabed.

We ask the question, what are the patterns of genetic affinity in these coral populations. We sampled coral tissue from populations of two species occurring on oil and gas platforms: Madracis decactis (hermatype) and Tubastraea coccinea (invasive ahermatype). We sampled 28 platforms along four transects from 20 km offshore to the continental shelf edge off 1) Matagorda Island, TX; 2) Lake Sabine, TX; 3) Terrebonne Bay, LA; and 4) Mobile, AL. The entire population of M. decactis was sampled between depths of 5 m and 37 m. T. coccinea populations were sub-sampled. Genetic variation was assessed using the PCR-based Amplified Fragment Length Polymorphisms (AFLPs). Data were analyzed via AFLPOP and STRUCTURE. Genetic connectivity among M. decactis platform populations was highest near the FGB and decreased to the east. Connectivity increased again in the eastern sector, indicating isolation between the populations from different sides of the Mississippi River (Transects 3 and 4). A point-drop in genetic affinity (relatedness) at the shelf edge south of Terrebonne Bay, LA indicated a population differing from all others in the northern GOM. Genetic affinities among T. coccinea were highest in the west and decreased to the east.

The work was done at the South Florida Ocean Measurement Facility of Naval Surface Warfare Center in Broward County, Florida, which has a range of active undersea detection and data transmission cables. EMF emissions from a selected cable were created during non-destructive visual fish surveys on SCUBA. During surveys, the transmission of either alternating current (AC), direct current (DC), or none (OFF) was randomly initiated by the facility at a specified time. Visual surveys were conducted using standardized transect and point-count methods to acquire reef fish abundances and species richness prior to and immediately after a change in transmission frequency. The divers were also tasked to note the reaction of the reef fish to the immediate change in EMF during a power transition. In general, analysis of the data did not find statistical differences among power states and any variables. However, this may be a Type II error as there are strong indications of a potential difference of a higher abundance of reef fish at the sites when the power was off, and further study is warranted.

It was deployed in 1987 and consists of 29 pyramids, each made of five concrete blocks (4 at the bottom and 1 at the top) with side of 2 m. The pyramids are placed on a stone bed and deployed in a rectangular arrangement at about 15 m from each other. Twelve concrete cages (4x5x6 m) for shellfish culture are also placed among the pyramids.The benthic community was investigated for two years, from April 1997 to March 1999. The horizontal surfaces of pyramids were sampled through a suction-sampler on a standard area of 40x40 cm, whereas the scraping technique was utilised for the vertical ones on an area of the same size (40x40 cm). Two replicates for both horizontal and vertical surfaces were carried out at each sampling.The epifauna settled on the artificial modules was dominated by filter-feeders. Crustaceans (amphipods) and polychaetes represented the most important groups on all surfaces. In particular, crustaceans (i.e. Corophium acherusicum) were more abundant on the top of pyramids, the second ones (Polydora ciliata) were more numerous on the bottom blocks.Regardless of the concrete cubes' level, the vertical walls were characterised by hard-substrate species, especially filter-feeders like bivalves (Mytilus galloprovincialis, Ostrea edulis, Crassostrea gigas), hydroids (Obelia dichotoma, Bougainvillia ramosa) and barnacles (i.e. Balanus trigonus, Balanus perforatus).These species were associated to deposit and suspending-feeders organisms typical of soft bottom (gastropods and small bivalves) on the horizontal surfaces that were covered by a thin layer of sandy-muddy sediment.The settlement of different community's structures on vertical and horizontal surfaces was induced by environmental conditions that characterised the walls. In fact, on the horizontal ones there was a more intense sedimentation linked to Cesano river's inflow and very fine mud suspended by wave motion; on the other hand, on the vertical surfaces an high hydrodynamism produced a continuous turn-over and a reduced accumulation of suspended material.",,,,,MTS/IEEE Conference on Celebrating the Past - Teaming Toward the FutureMTS/IEEE Conference on Celebrating the Past - Teaming Toward the Future,"SEP 22-26, 2003SEP 22-26, 2003",Marine Technol Soc; IEEE; OES; Scripps Inst OceanogMarine Technol Soc; IEEE; OES; Scripps Inst Oceanog,"San Diego, CASan Diego, CA",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,0-933957-30-0,,,,,,,,,"CNR, ISMAR, I-00185 Rome, Italy",,,,2003-01-01,WOS:000221420300183,,

The biogenic structures that provide this nursery function, however, are increasingly degraded. Therefore, any effort to conserve, restore or replace habitat with artificial structure should be guided by an understanding of the value provided by that nursery habitat. Here, we experimentally manipulated structure across a number of sites by inserting pinnind bivalve mimics into the seabed and deploying video cameras to observe the response of post-settlement stage snapper, Chrysophrys auratus (Forster in Bloch and Schneider 1801). We also collected a range of environmental variables across these sites to determine the relative importance to snapper of benthic vs. pelagic productivity. While the abundance of snapper was low, our results demonstrated a strong association to structure relative to control plots. The environmental variable with the highest correlation to snapper abundance was the abundance of zooplankton eaten by snapper. This result was well supported by the dominance of zooplankton over small benthic invertebrates in snapper gut contents, and the weak influence of benthic infauna in our regression models. These regressions also demonstrated that when combined with zooplankton abundance, turbidity had a negative relationship to snapper abundance. This highlights the importance of relatively clear water in estuaries, which allows post-settlement snapper to more efficiently consume the zooplankton that are present in the water column. The third component that post-settlement snapper require is of course the presence of benthic structure. While benthic habitat structure was the strongest factor affecting juvenile snapper abundance, we did not find any correlations to suggest that this importance was related to energetic sheltering and access to locations with high food flux.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,2296-7745; 2296-7745,,,,,,,,,,,"Natl Inst Water & Atmospher Res, Auckland, New Zealand",,,,2019-04-19,ZOOREC:ZOOR15505028260,,

The evaluation included five different areas: a kelp farm, an oyster farm, a fish farm, the thermal discharge area of a power plant, and an artificial reef, and we aimed to identify whether anthropogenic activities dominated spatial variation in the mesozooplankton communities. The results demonstrated clear spatial heterogeneity among the mesozooplankton communities of the studied areas, dominantly driven by natural hydrographic properties, except in the area near the thermal discharge outlet of the power station. In the outlet area, thermal shock caused by the discharge influenced the mesozooplankton community by decreasing abundance and biomass throughout the four seasons, even causing a shift in the dominant species near the outlet during summer from Acartia pacifica to eurythermal and warm water taxa. Unique features of the mesozooplankton community in the oyster farm may be due to the combined effects of oyster culture and the natural environment in the branch harbour. However, kelp and fish culture, and the construction of an artificial reef did not exert any obvious influence on the mesozooplankton communities up to 2010, probably because of the small scale of the aquaculture and a time lag in the rehabilitation effects of the artificial reef. Thus, our results suggested that the dominant factors influencing spatial variations of mesozooplankton communities in Xiangshan Bay were still the natural hydrographic properties, but the thermal discharge was an anthropogenic activity that changed the pelagic ecosystem, and should be supervised.",,,,,,,,,9,2,0,0,8,0,10,,,0025-3154,1469-7769,,,,,,,,,,"Ningbo Univ, Sch Marine Sci, 818 Fenghua Rd, Ningbo 315211, Zhejiang, Peoples R ChinaSecond Inst Oceanog, Key Lab Marine Ecosyst & Biogeochem, State Ocean Adm, 36 Baochubei Rd, Hangzhou 310012, Zhejiang, Peoples R China",,,,2018-09-04,WOS:000435649100005,,

Triangular configurations had side lengths of: 25 m, 15 m, 5 m, and 0.33 m; each treatment with two replicates. Two additional configurations: (1) a solitary module (Single) and (2) two modules side by side (Double), also with two replicates, were deployed in order to examine the interaction of reef size with fish assemblages. SCUBA divers censused fishes monthly, for 2 years, recording the species present, their abundance and sizes (TL). Fishes were assigned to one of five length categories: < 2 cm, > 2-5 cm, > 5-10 cm, > 10-20 cm, and > 20 cm. In general and excluding the smallest three-module spacing treatment (0.33 m treatment), which may have provided unique treatment-specific refuge, total fish abundance and richness were shown to increase when isolation distance increased. However, there were also species-specific and size class differences in response to isolation distance. The second part of this study indicated varying reef size, by doubling and tripling the number of reef modules, increased total fish abundance and species richness. Nevertheless, fish abundance and species richness did not change by an identical multiplier (e.g., doubling modules not equal double abundance). These results suggest that scientists and marine managers alike should consider reef size and isolation as habitat attributes capable of altering the structure and dynamics of reef fish assemblages.

The risk posed by a wreck is governed by its condition, hazardous substances contained in the wreck and the state of the surrounding environment.

The relationships of count data from non-pomacentrid families between transects 10 and 5 m wide and pomacentrid genera between transects 2 and 1 m wide were found to be strongly Linear, with correlation coefficients of 0.94 and 0.98 respectively. The strength of both relationships was not significantly compromised by differences among selected taxa or benthic habitats. As such, comparison of data collected from different transect widths was considered feasible after application of conversion factors derived from the Linear relationships. We suggest that the use of experimentally derived conversion factors may be applicable for other researchers faced with problems of data comparison across studies where different transect dimensions have been used. Density estimates from wider transects were 22 to 26 % less than estimates from narrower transects for the majority of taxa. The precision (coefficient of variation) of density estimates did not vary significantly between transect dimensions, however precision varied greatly between species, genera and families, with values ranging from 0.18 to 0.85. Transect width and the behaviour, habitat specificity and number of target fish taxon are implicated as important contributors to variation in the accuracy and precision of visual census data.

This paper explores how the changing climate is likely to affect oil and gas operations in low-lying coastal areas and the outer continental shelf. Oil and gas production in these regions comprises a large sector of the economies of many energy producing nations. Six key climate change drivers in coastal and marine regions are characterized with respect to oil and gas development: changes in carbon dioxide levels and ocean acidity, air and water temperature, precipitation patterns, the rate of sea level rise, storm intensity, and wave regime. These key drivers have the potential to independently and cumulatively affect coastal and offshore oil and gas exploration, production, and transportation, and several impacts of climate change have already been observed in North America.

The biogenic structures that provide this nursery function, however, are increasingly degraded. Therefore, any effort to conserve, restore or replace habitat with artificial structure should be guided by an understanding of the value provided by that nursery habitat. Here, we experimentally manipulated structure across a number of sites by inserting pinnind bivalve mimics into the seabed and deploying video cameras to observe the response of post-settlement stage snapper, Chrysophrys auratus (Forster in Bloch and Schneider 1801). We also collected a range of environmental variables across these sites to determine the relative importance to snapper of benthic vs. pelagic productivity. While the abundance of snapper was low, our results demonstrated a strong association to structure relative to control plots. The environmental variable with the highest correlation to snapper abundance was the abundance of zooplankton eaten by snapper. This result was well supported by the dominance of zooplankton over small benthic invertebrates in snapper gut contents, and the weak influence of benthic infauna in our regression models. These regressions also demonstrated that when combined with zooplankton abundance, turbidity had a negative relationship to snapper abundance. This highlights the importance of relatively clear water in estuaries, which allows post-settlement snapper to more efficiently consume the zooplankton that are present in the water column. The third component that post-settlement snapper require is of course the presence of benthic structure. While benthic habitat structure was the strongest factor affecting juvenile snapper abundance, we did not find any correlations to suggest that this importance was related to energetic sheltering and access to locations with high food flux.",,,,,,,,,5,0,0,0,5,0,5,,,,2296-7745,,,,,,,,,,"Natl Inst Water & Atmospher Res, Hamilton, New ZealandNatl Inst Water & Atmospher Res, Auckland, New ZealandUniv Auckland, Inst Marine Sci, Auckland, New Zealand",,,,2019-02-13,WOS:000457484500001,,

While a coastal structure can eventually provide shelter and spawning grounds for fish, it requires several years to rejuvenate the damaged ecosystem. It has been shown that an artificially created habitat has an accelerated colonization rate when minerals are electrochemically deposited onto an artificial structure.Consequently, electrochemically depositing minerals onto a wire mesh, stretched along the foot of a breakwater or revetment, in order to accelerate the return of living organisms may provide significant benefit. However, the strength of the electrodeposited compound and its bond to the wire mesh has to be sufficient to withstand wave attack. This was the primary aim of the investigation described in this paper.A 100L plastic container filled with 3.5% saline solution simulated ocean water conditions. Sea salt was used instead of ordinary table salt to ensure the electrodeposited mineral structure matched the mineral structure that would be obtained in salt water. Three types of non-galvanized wire mesh cathodes and four different types of metal anodes were employed in various experiments. In addition, the voltage and current levels were varied. A small amount of electrodeposit material was achieved in each test; however, the amount of deposition was not enough to obtain an accurate weight! The primary flaw in the investigation was using a closed system of such a small volume. During the experiment, the pH levels increased, hindering the creation of larger crystals. Furthermore, ionization of the metal anode polluted the system.Although, habitat enhancement by electro-deposition has merit, these laboratory experiments demonstrated that future tests require an open system, such as the ocean. An alternate solution is to monitor and buffer the pH of a closed system.",,,,,,,,,2,0,0,0,1,0,2,,,0749-0208,,,,,,,,,,,"Queens Univ, Ctr Water & Environm, Kingston, ON, CanadaCoastal Planning & Engn Inc, Boca Raton, FL 33431 USA",,,,2005-03-01,WOS:000230629600043,,

Similar projections can be made for other developed countries many of which depend on the coastal zone as a major source of tourism-related income. The long-term ecological health and sustainability of the marine and coastal environments are obviously at risk. Coastal projects such as beach re-nourishment, housing developments, and pipe-line, harbor and marina construction can have negative impacts on the coastal environment that must be minimized and often mitigated. Typically, mitigation is done after the fact at considerable expense and often with a questionable return of ecosystem services. However, multiple research projects clearly show that species-specific and lifestage-specific habitat can be designed into artificial structure. Thus, with forethought, coastal construction can include structural designs that are not only ecosystem friendly but which also return ecosystem services impacted by construction.

Before the deployment of artificial reef, the maximum thermocline of water column (MTWC) formed at depths of 30 similar to 40 m in almost all of the studied area. However, after the deployment of the artificial reef, depending on tide time, variations in MTWC were observed about 10 similar to 17m shallower in areas within 1 km in radius of the artificial reef due to uplifting of isotherms. In waters surrounding the artificial reef, vertical currents alternate between local downwelling flow (LDF) and local upwelling flow (LUF), and this type of phenomenon is dependent on tide time and takes on various patterns of spatial distribution. In addition, the degree of vertical mixing, which can be deduced from areas with strong current shears, especially in the surrounding area of the artificial reef from which the LUF originates, was found to be distributed in a similar manner. Although there are tide time-dependent differences in the Richardson number (Ri), in depths of 30 similar to 40 m or deeper, where the Ri is less than 0.25, the water column was destabilized by vertical mixing. In addition, differences in nutrient distribution were noted before and after the artificial reef deployment. Highly stratified nutrients rose to the upper layer after passing the artificial reef, and the accumulation of nutrients can be attributed to the LUF developingat the artificial reef. Thus, in periods of strong stratification during the summer, the upward movement of nutrients from the aphotic to the euphotic layer increases the primary production levels, triggering the formation of a marine food chain in those areas.",,,,,,,,,6,0,0,0,1,0,6,,,0023-6152,,,,,,,,,,,"Kyushu Univ, Dept Bioresource Sci, Lab Marin Environm Sci, Div Anim & Marine Bioresource Sci,Fac Agr, Fukuoka 8128581, Japan",,,,2013-11-07,WOS:000324846500025,,

Coastal hardening replaces natural habitats with urban/industrial waterfronts that cannot provide ecosystem services similar to those offered by undisturbed coastlines. As a result, CMI are often considered as sacrificed zones with no environmental value. Studies show that marine flora and fauna on CMI, is typically less diverse than natural assemblages, and is commonly dominated by nuisance and invasive species. Here we summarize the results of a 24 month monitoring study of a breakwater section (Haifa, Israel) composed of armor unites cast from a proprietary concrete mix with an ecological design (ECOncrete (R) Antifers - EA). The study compared benthic community structure (fish, invertebrates and algae), species richness, live cover, diversity and the ratio of invasive to local species, on EA to that of an adjacent breakwater section made of standard Antifers (SA) composed of Portland based concrete. The abundance, richness and diversity of invertebrates and fish were higher on and around the EA compared to SA, while the ratio of invasive to local species was considerably lower. Moreover, engineering species such as oysters, serpulid worms, bryozoans and coralline algae were more dominant on the EA than on the SA. These ecosystem engineers increase the complexity of the structure, by means of biogenic buildup, which increase the availability of food and shelter in the area, while potentially contributing to the structures stability and longevity via bioprotection. The study indicates the ability of design substrate alterations to facilitate competition for space between local and invasive species on CMI, and demonstrates the feasibility of applying environmentally sensitive technologies for enhancing the biological and ecological performance of structures like breakwaters, piers, and seawalls. Ecological enhancement of concrete based CMI increases the ecosystem services provided by the structure, without hampering its structural performance, and thus should be integrated into future coastal development projects, preferably and most efficiently from early planning stages.

The QICS project (Quantifying and Monitoring Potential Ecosystem Impacts of Geological Carbons Storage) was established to improve our understanding of these potential impacts and to develop tools and best practice for monitoring sub-seabed CCS reservoirs. Exposure to increased environmental CO2 has been shown to raise the tissue pCO(2) of many marine invertebrate species, leading to tissue acidosis and perturbations in both ion transport and bicarbonate buffering. These disturbances can cause downstream effects, seen as metabolic depression in susceptible organisms, compromising the role of particular species within an ecosystem and even causing the local extinction of species groups. To monitor the potential impact to surficial benthic megafauna, cages of bivalves (the common mussel Mytilus edulis Linnaeus, 1758 and the king scallop Pecten maximus (Linnaeus, 1758)) were deployed at the gas release site and at a reference site both within Ardmucknish Bay, Oban, Scotland. Replicate individuals were sampled at six time points over a 125-day period, which spanned both the 37-day injection and recovery phases of the experiment, in order to establish impacts to molecular physiology. Samples of bivalves were also simultaneously sampled from a reference site within the bay in order to contrast changes in physiology induced by the gas release with naturally variability in the physiological performance of both species. We present data on changes in the transcription of genes coding for key ionic and carbon dioxide regulatory proteins. There was no evidence of gene regulation of either selected carbonic anhydrases (CAx genes) or the alpha subunit of sodium potassium ATPAses (ATP1A genes) in individual bivalves collected from the CO2 gas release site, in either species. In the common mussel M. edulis there was only evidence for changes with time in the expression of genes coding for different classes of carbonic anhydrase. It was therefore concluded that the effects of the plume of elevated pCO(2) on ion-regulatory gene transcription were negligible in both species. Whilst the analysed data from this current study do not constitute an impediment to the continued development of sub-seabed CCS as a climate mitigation strategy, further modelling is necessary to predict the consequences of larger or longer term leaks. Further analysis is also required in order to constrain the potential physiological impacts of gas leaks to benthic infaunal species and understand the mechanism of possible avoidance behaviour recorded in burrowing heart urchins Echinocardium cordatum (Pennant, 1777).

There are extensive mangroves, seagrass and algae bottoms, submerged and emergent coral reefs, and a group of small volcanic islands that comprises the Abrolhos Archipelago. The region's coral reef biodiversity is the highest registered in the Southern Atlantic, harboring large populations of Brazilian endemic coral and reef fish species. Abrolhos is characterized by a relict coral fauna that appears to have a relatively higher tolerance to muddy conditions than that of other regions. The Marine RAP survey team assessed 45 sites over an 18-day period (11-28 February 2000), including 19 expert specialists from Brazilian universities, NGOs and the Brazilian Government. At each site, an underwater inventory was made of six faunal groups selected to serve as indicators of overall biodiversity. The faunal groups included corals, fishes, algae, polychaete worms, molluscs, and crustaceans (the last three groups were analyzed only on bottom-sediment samples). In addition to the species inventory, bottom-sediment samples were taken in the immediate vicinity of the reefs. Observations and data on reef fisheries were also gathered by a fisheries scientist who evaluated the abundance and size of the main target species at each site. Additionally, the knowledge about species occurrences from other papers, were compiled by specialists producing a more complete list of species for the region. Nearly 1300 species were registered for the six biological groups surveyed, with the following distribution: 39 anthozoans of 21 families; 266 fishes of 79 families; 100 algae of 31 families; 90 polychaete worms of 37 families; 293 molluscs of 80 families; and 535 crustaceans of 116 families. Three algae, 17 mollusc and 11 crustacean species were registered for the first time in Brazil. Fifteen algae, 2 coral, 86 polychaete, 23 crustacean, and near 100 fish species were registered for the first time in the Abrolhos Bank. At least 17 mollusc and one fish species were new to science and are being descripted. Other groups such as some polychaete worms and crustacean (Ostracoda, Stomatopoda, Tanaidacea, Cumacea, Isopoda and Asellota) have also potentially new species but the absence of taxonomists for them did not allow an accurate estimation. Data gathered on abundance and size of reef fishes indicates that the implemented portion of the park shows positive signs of protection, at least for some families. Sand and mud are the most common bottom sediments surrounding the reefs surveyed in the Abrolhos region. Coarse (gravel) sediments are relatively uncommon. High levels of siliciclastic-dominated sediments were not evident in most samples gathered during the RAP survey, probably because bottom samples were collected close to reefs and therefore contained bioclastic material from reef organisms, rather than sediment transported from shore. Muddy sediments were mostly of biogenic origin, probably resulting from bioerosional activities of various boring organisms. The major concerns for the long-term maintenance of the mosaic of marine and coastal ecosystems of the Abrolhos Bank are the insufficient representation of key biodiverse areas, lack of implementation and compliance to the laws or regulations of the currently existing MPA network, overall inefficient fisheries management and the large industrial projects related to the cellulose and oil industries. The following fifteen recommendations are made to deal with these threats. 1) Expand the representation of key biodiverse areas into the existing network of marine protected areas of the Abrolhos; 2) Implement the largest marine protected area of the Abrolhos Bank, the Ponta da Baleia/Abrolhos Environmental Protected Area; 3) Enforce the fully protected areas of the Abrolhos Bank; 4) Improve existing partnerships with governmental and non-governmental organizations in order to integrate marine and coastal resources management; 5) Develop financial mechanisms to support coastal and marine conservation; 6) Enforce existing laws and enact more effective laws to regulate fishing activities; 7) Identify major sources of sediments that reach coral reefs and determine the extent (and scale) that sedimentation is affecting coral growth and recruitment; 8) Conduct additional biological surveys in other areas of the Abrolhos Bank; 9) Implement additional conservation programs for endangered marine life; 10) Expand and integrate current environmental monitoring programs; 11) Implement a national environmental awareness campaign focusing onmarine ecosystems; 12) Strengthen community participation in conservation planning and management; 13) Regulate the oil and gas exploration, and mining; 14) Establish best-practices policies for companies operating in the region; 15) Regulate tourism/whale watching.

The purpose of this document is to provide a summary of current DFO research results on the transport, fate and biological effects of operational drilling and production wastes on the eastern Canadian continental shelf. The Department of Fisheries and Oceans, assisted by funding from the Program for Energy Research and Development, has been conducting research on the transport, fate and effects of drilling wastes and the development of oil spill countermeasures since the late 1980's. During this time, international research has addressed continuing controversies regarding the impact of the offshore oil and gas industry. There is growing concern that produced water discharges may be causing contamination and effects on fish and fish habitat. The environmental data on production water are limited and few studies have been conducted on lethal and sub-lethal effects on marine organisms. The particulate fraction of discharged operational drilling wastes is also of concern because their drift, dispersion and dilution are generally lower than those of dissolved or buoyant discharges. The collection and interpretation of physical, chemical, geological, and biological oceanographic data have provided insight into the processes that influence drilling waste deposition on the seafloor and their subsequent redistribution. This research indicates that drilling waste discharges do not always disperse to negligible concentrations on the continental shelf, but can become concentrated in the near-seabed region (benthic boundary layer). Comprehensive three-dimensional models, developed to improve our capability for estimating the geographic 'zone of influence' of discharged drilling wastes, indicate that the exposure of organisms to potentially deleterious drilling waste concentrations can be expected to vary substantially between drilling sites. An important environmental concern related to the impact of offshore oil and gas developments is the consequence to resident organisms of long-term exposure to low-level contaminants. Only a very small fraction of marine organisms and life stages have been studied with respect to the potential for chronic lethal and sublethal effects at low waste levels. DFO studies on the chronic biological effects of production drilling wastes has focused on determining dose-response relationships in order to provide an estimate of the potential size of impact zones associated with spills or discharges from rig sites. Laboratory studies with flounder and sea scallops indicate little potential for drilling war waste toxicity beyond 1-2 km from a production drilling sites. A low level of MPO enzyme induction in American plaice taken near the Hibernia development site was observed. Prolonged or repeated induction of MFO especially to high levels, has the potential to produce a variety of physiological and pathological conditions in fish. Although observed impacts of drilling wastes have generally been attributed to chemical toxicity or organic enrichment effects of associated oil- and synthetic-base fluids, there is increasing field and laboratory evidence to indicate that fine particles in drilling wastes contribute greatly to the effects observed around drilling platforms. The studies with sea scallops indicate that physical interference by bentonite and barite particles in drilling wastes can significantly affect growth and reproduction at environmentally relevant concentrations. Modelling studies of the fate and effects of drilling wastes on scallops suggest there exists a small probability of detectable and significant population and ecosystem level effects of exploration drilling in some areas of the eastern Canadian shelf. The volume of produced water discharges will undoubtedly increase with the expansion of offshore oil and gas production operations in Atlantic Canada. While rapid dilution of the effluent stream is likely to reduce the concentrations to levels which are not acutely toxic to marine organisms, the possibility of chronic long-term effects cannot be excluded. Preliminary results have demonstrated a high level of spatial and temporal variability for contaminants within produced water samples recovered from the Atlantic Region. Furthermore, there is evidence that produced water contaminants may become concentrated within environmental compartments of known ecological importance (e.g. surface microlayer, benthic boundary layer). Important gaps in knowledge remain with respect to factors affecting dispersion of drilling discharges and chronic ecotoxicological effects of offshore oil and gas activities. An important step in addressing uncertainty is to have in place rigorous monitoring programs which take an ecosystem approach to provide early warning of any adverse environmental impacts. Environmental monitoring and protection plans should address site- and project-specific elements and the potential for impacts from other sources. Overall, oil fields situated on major fishing grounds that discharge large quantities of production waters and drilling wastes within an area that is impacted by discharges from adjacent fields, present the most concern for potential curnulative impacts on fish and fish habitat.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,,0,0,0,,,0706-6457,,,,,,,,,,,"Department of Fisheries and Oceans Maritimes Region, Bedford Institute of Oceanography, Dartmouth, NS, B2Y 4A2, Canada",,,,2001-01-01,BCI:BCI200100500857,,

Here a novel and unobtrusive method of recording deep-water coral behaviour in the laboratory is described using time-lapse video to record silhouettes of the polyps under infrared illumination. The polyps of L. pertusa behaved asynchronously and did not show any clear diurnal patterns over a three-day observation period. Conceptually, sessile benthic suspension feeders appear to be vulnerable to smothering by sediments disturbed by bottom trawls or sub-seabed drilling. This method allows deep-water coral polyp behaviour to be continuously monitored in the laboratory and, therefore, the responses of coral polyps to environmental perturbations such as sedimentation can be recorded.

Red snapper were tagged with depth transmitters and movements were tracked (n = 7; VR2W Positioning System, Vemco Ltd., Nova Scotia) on an artificial reef site 28 km south of Dauphin Island, Alabama in the northern Gulf of Mexico for two years. More than 3.5 million accurate positions (similar to 1 m) were obtained and used to assess red snapper depth patterns over monthly and hourly time periods. In addition, three-dimensional (3-D) patterns of red snapper volume use (m(3)) were estimated based on depth and location (latitude, longitude) from >700,000 3-D positions. Red snapper depth preferences and volume use varied over time periods. Red snapper tended to stay at deeper depths during the colder months (<3 m from seafloor), and move up in the water column more frequently in the late spring and summer months (F-23,F-127 = 45.5, P<0.0001). Similarly, volume use patterns varied significantly by month (core, F-23,F-127 =13.14, P < 0.0001; home range, F-23,F-127 = 27.6, P <0.0001) with the smallest movements in February and largest in August (2013) or October (2014) depending on year. Diel home range volume showed that red snapper made fewer movements during night (1900-0400 h) compared to day (0600-1700 h; F-23,F-3585 = 13.2, P<0.0001). The present habitat use patterns were surprising, because for the most part red snapper were previously considered a benthic oriented reef species. However, in the present study depth and volume shape patterns showed use of the entire water column during the spring and summer. These higher water column use patterns were likely related to spawning patterns and prey availability over both diel and monthly time periods, but further studies are needed to help confirm such correlations.

A study was conducted to assess juvenile fish recruitment at varying culvert densities within the artificial reef area. Standard monitoring units for the recruitment of reef fish (SMURFs) were used to sample juvenile fish, and these collections were compared with visual scuba surveys. The 0.027-m(3) SMURFs were placed at four different culvert densities (0, 1-50, 51-100, and 101+ culverts in a 30-m radius) and sampled during 2013 to 2014. Measurements of rugosity, vertical relief, and percent cover were collected to elucidate factors that drive juvenile recruitment. Average species richness was highest at sites with no culverts and lowest at dense culvert sites. Species compositions were significantly different between sampling locations with no culverts and all locations with culverts; average similarity was 33.8%. Belted Sandfish Serranus subligarius was the most ubiquitous species among all sampling locations. Visual scuba surveys at the same locations showed lower diversity indices of the juvenile fish community than observed by SMURFs and were only 14% similar to the community sampled by the SMURFs. These findings suggest SMURFs are a more effective tool for examining juvenile fish at an artificial reef due to the cryptic nature of juveniles and the low visibility around shallow reefs. Additionally, commercially important Yellowedge Grouper Hyporthodus flavolimbatus, Warsaw Grouper H. nigritus, and Red Snapper Lutjanus campechanus juveniles were only found at SMURFs at sampling locations with no culverts.

The first of such SEAs was of the area to the north and west of Shetland known as the 'White Zone'. This report is a contribution to SEA2, which includes the mature oil and gas fields of the Southern, Central and Northern North Sea, and describes issues related to fish and fisheries. The information provided as part of this process will be used to describe environmental sensitivities in the region, and may be used to impose conditions on some licences. The recent OSPAR Quality Status Report of the North Sea identified several priority human activities which have greatest impact on the marine environment, and these included the direct and indirect effects of fishing, the input of oil and PAHs by the offshore oil and gas industry, and the input of nutrients and trace organic contaminants from land. This report has focussed on the implications for fish and fisheries of continued exploration and production of oil and gas. Of course, there are several other human activities in the North Sea which also impact fish and fisheries, and foremost amongst these is the effect of commercial exploitation itself. This report has restricted discussion of the impact on fish populations to these two industries. The report describes the fish resources of the region (i.e. spawning grounds, nurseryareas), and also the intensity and distribution of commercial fishing activity. It describes those fisheries management measures which recommend seasonal closures of parts of the North Sea to protect spawning or juvenile fish, and regions where these may have consequences for oil and gas exploration and production. The report also summarises the most important consequences of oil and gas exploration for fish populations and commercial fisheries, such as the use of seismic surveys and the placement of structures on the sea bed. Most of the commercially important fish species spawn in the spring, between January and June, although sandeel and herring are exceptions which spawn outside this period. Shrimp, edible crab and lobster tend to be winter spawners, but the period of egg brooding is protracted. Spawning areas and nursery grounds for most fish species are dynamic features of life history and are rarely fixed in one location from year to year. Thus, while some species have similar patterns of distribution from one year to the next, others show greater variability. The combined distribution of spring-spawning fish species showed that much of the northern SEA2 region supports spawning activity of three or more of these species, while in the central region spawning activity is more sporadic, and some areas have occurs in coastal waters and in the most easterly part. There are several fish species of conservation importance in the North Sea, however relatively few are found in the offshore waters of the North Sea, and may thus be considered vulnerable to human activity in this region. The European sturgeon is rare and at its northerly limit in the North Sea. The basking shark, tope and porbeagle are likely to occur in small numbers throughout the North Sea, and the common skate occurs at low density throughout the northern North Sea, but is very rare in the southern North Sea. Descriptions of major North Sea fisheries were prepared from official landing statistics, anecdotal information from local ports, and over-flight surveillance data. Official landing statistics of the major species by ICES rectangle are available for UK fleets, but only for cod and sandeel are international landings by rectangle available. The North Sea is one of the world's most important fishing grounds. Major UK and international fishing fleets operate in the southern, central and northern North Sea and target both pelagic and demersal fish stocks. One of the most important fisheries in the North Sea is the mixed demersal fishery that targets cod, haddock and whiting in the central and northern parts of the region. Otter trawl and seine net vessels catch cod as part of a mixed fishery in which haddock and whiting form an important component of the catch. Otter trawling accounted for most of the fishing effort in the northern North Sea, where beam trawls are rarely used, but in central and southern SEA2 regions otter trawls are less common. Most effort was confined to the northeast coast of the UK, northeast of Scotland and east of the Shetland Islands. Parts of the Norwegian Deep and the central North Sea were relatively lightly fished. Recent overflight data shows that most otter trawl effort was concentrated to the north and west of the Orkney and Shetland Islands throughout the year, near the Fladen Ground and the northeast coast of England in the 1st and 4th quarters of the year, and during the spring and summer months further offshore near the Dogger Bank and the Silver Pit. North Sea plaice and sole are taken in a mixed flatfish fishery by mainly Dutch and UK registered beam trawlers in the southern and southeastern North Sea. There are also directed fisheries for plaice carried out with seine and gill nets and by beam trawlers in the central North Sea. The distribution of the international beam trawl fleet indicates that most trawling activity is concentrated in the Southern Bight of the North Sea, particularly along the Continental coast from Denmark to the Straits of Dover, and is high in the offshore part of the southern SEA2 region. Inshore fleets are heavily dependent on sole, especially during the second half of the year. Herring is one of the most important species landed by the UK pelagic fleet. During the 1970s there was a decrease in their spawning stock biomass, largely caused by overexploitation and poor recruitment. In 1977, the North Sea herring fishery was closed, and did not reopen until 1983. Fishing for herring is mainly undertaken with purse seines and trawls offshore and to a smaller extent by fixed nets in coastal waters. While North Sea stocks are fished throughout the year, landings are greatest in the third quarter of the year, predominantly from the Orkney/Shetland area, Buchan, northwest of the Dogger Bank and in coastal waters of eastern England. The other major North Sea pelagic fishery is for mackerel, which supports an extensive, directed fishery by pelagic trawlers in the northern North Sea, taking advantage of the migration of the western stock to this feeding area. This is a very important species for the Scottish fleet, and by weight it is one of the most abundant pelagic species landed. Fishing in the North Sea occurs throughout the year with peak landings in July to September, and moderate levels of fishing activity take place between the Faeroe Islands and the Norwegian coast during the first half of the year. Crustacean fisheries are generally of high value and target specific grounds at different times of the year. A range of gears, such as bottom trawls, prawn trawls, seines, pots and dredges are used in these fisheries. Norway lobster are landed from the north and west of the Dogger Bank, along the northeast coast of England, the eastern coast of Scotland, and on the Fladen ground in the central SEA2 region. The pink shrimp fishery is also concentrated in the deep muddy areas of the Fladen Ground. The edible crab fishery is an important source of income to UK shellfishers, and the fishery is now prosecuted throughout the year by many fishermen, supplying both the live continental market and the home processing market. Unlike Norway lobster and pink shrimp, crabs are captured in traps, called pots or creels, which are baited with fresh fish, and larger vessels will work up to 1000 traps. Crab fisheries occur on coarse grounds in coastal UK waters, and in the south these can extend eastwards into the gas fields of the southern SEA2 region. Finally, important scallop fisheries occur on suitable sand and gravel sediment around Shetland and Orkney, and along the east coast of Scotland, exploited by vessels using heavy, wide toothed dredges. Most landings are taken from inshore areas, but some grounds are over 60 miles offshore, and can extend into the oil fields in the northern North Sea.The effects of these fish and shellfish fisheries are widespread and ecologically important, and the depletion of some target species impacts the whole North Sea ecosystem. There is concern about the stocks of herring, cod, haddock, whiting, saithe, plaice and sole which areclose to or outside Safe Biological Limits. Catch levels for many fish stocks are almost certainly not sustainable. To ensure the sustainability and recovery of these fisheries, a range of fisheries management measures have been implemented by the European Commission. This reportdescribes only technical measures (area and seasonal closures) that restrict access to specific fleets in order to offer protection to juveniles and spawning adults and encourage stock recovery. For example, during spring 2001, a large closed area was implemented in the North Sea which restricted access to cod fisheries. The closure covered the main spawning area and season for mature cod. Similarly, in the southern North Sea a permanently protected area (the plaice box) was established to reduce the mortality of juvenile plaice in the beam trawl fishery (Fig. 4.2.1.1). Sandeel fisheries at Shetland and off the east coast of Scotland are also closed seasonally. Both the cod closure and plaice boxhave caused the displacement of fishing activity away from traditional grounds and towards the oil and gas fields of the North Sea. For the otter trawl fleet this represents an increase in existing levels of local effort in regions where the two industries already co-exist. There issome evidence of a slight increase in beam trawl activity in the Central and Northern SEA2 regions, since the gear was first used in the southern North Sea during the 1960s. This may have implications for the safety of both the fishing vessels and underwater structuresassociated with the hydrocarbon industry when they come into contact. Some form of spatial exclusion during the spawning season is likely to be retained for cod. The offshore oil and gas industry has become a major economic activity in the North Sea since the late 1960s, and during the 1990s oil production almost doubled. There are now almost 500 platforms and 10,000 kilometres of rigid and flexible oil and gas pipelinesrunning between offshore production wells and terminals on land. There are a number of ways in which offshore oil and gas exploration and production may impact fish populations and restrict the commercial exploitation of fish stocks. These can include the potential effects of seismic surveys on fish populations during the spawning season, the impact on the seabed of drill cuttings at well sites, and the exclusion of fishing vessels from subsea wellheads, the area adjacent to the platform, and associated structures which require protection. Seismic surveys use high energy sound sources to locate the geological structures that are associated with hydrocarbon deposits. When organisms are in close proximity to such an air gun array there is thought to be a high risk of injury or death, however, for fish populations, there is also concern for the non-lethal behavioural effects of the disturbance. The disruptive effect of such surveys has been confirmed by recent studies which suggested that the use of air gun arrays could reduce catches of cod and haddock over a large area, and for several days after completion of the survey. Although the impacts of seismic activity outside the spawning season will be largely transient, and result merely in the temporary redistribution of fish, during the spawning season this effect could be more serious and may lead to the severe disruption of spawning activity. While there is no direct evidence of an adverse impact of seismic activity on the spawning success of fish, there is sufficient concern to suggest that a precautionary approach is applied to the use of this equipment. The Fisheries Departments currently apply licence conditions which prevent seismic surveys during specified periods of the year in certain blocks. These controls have been used effectively for the last decade, and are regularly reviewed. This suggests that the production of underwater noise by the offshore industry now has only a minor impact on fish populations. Wells require lubrication by viscous drilling muds, and these have traditionally been discharged into the sea. Water based mud (WBM) released into the water column becomes separated from the cuttings and is diluted, and rock particles in the water column are unlikely to be distinguishable from natural suspended solids. In the relatively shallow and dispersive waters of the southern North Sea, it is generally considered that cuttings do not accumulate at the well site but are transported away from the platform and dispersed naturally. The most common effect of the WBM is an elevation of barium concentrations in the sediments, which may extend up to 1,000m from the drilling location along the predominant tidal axis. Barium persists in sediments, in the form of barium sulphate or carbonate, which are insoluble and therefore inert. Only in the deep waters of the northern North Sea have accumulated cuttings piles become the focus for more specific research. In these environments, physical changes attributable to drilling discharges can be long-lasting. Cuttings piles may still be clearly visible for some time, smothering the benthic fauna at the well site and resulting in reduced densities of benthic organisms nearby. While these cuttings piles remain within the 500 m safety zone they are considered to be relatively inert and to have a minimal impact on fish populations and trawling activity. It is increasingly common for operators to select environmentally acceptable drilling muds such as waterbased muds or low toxicity oil based mud. The constituents of mud systems must also be identified in the Offshore Chemical Notification Scheme which categorises chemicals according to their toxicity, persistence and bioaccumulation potential. Many wells currently drilled in the North Sea retain muds for transfer to shore for processing and disposal, although WBM is generally left on site. Although some studies have investigated the sitespecific impact of contaminants on benthic fauna, there are no data which describe the impact of cuttings on fish populations, or the secondary effects on populations through loss of feeding areas. The smothering of seabed fauna and sediments is a potential threat to species such as herring that require particular sediments on which to feed and spawn. The preferred oil and gas industry option during decommissioning is to leave cuttings piles in situ, and this topic is currently the subject of an extensive UKOOA joint industry funded research project. It is possible that such piles may be rapidly dispersed by trawls, thereby increasing the potential for contamination. Concerns about the impact of over-trawling of such cuttings piles are currently the subject of research programmes. The damage caused to the marine environment by an accidental release of oil, condensate or diesel depends on the size of the spill, the characteristics of the hydrocarbon, the prevailing weather conditions, and the proximity of sensitive populations. Diesel and condensate have low viscosity, and so when spilt at sea they spread rapidly and disperse. The accidental release of oil presents a greater risk, particularly in the event of an oil well blow-out in which the hydrocarbons cannot be contained. There have been no such incidents during drilling activity in the North Sea to date. All hydrocarbon spills can affect fish by tainting, caused by ingestion of hydrocarbon residues present in the water column and on the sea bed. In the event of a spill, Ministers can establish temporary fishing exclusion zones which prevent fishing for a fixed period of time to maintain public confidence in the standard of fish and shellfish as food. Recently, such fisheries exclusion zones were established after the Braer and Sea Empress oil spill incidents, which were related to the transport rather than to the exploration and production of hydrocarbons. The Braer spill had particularly severe effects on the fish farming industry in the Shetland Islands, while commercial fishing activities were only affected in a small area of the Burra Haaf. In 1997 an exclusion zone was established after a large spill at the Captain field in the outer Moray Firth. Monitoring studies conducted by FRS Marine Laboratory (SEERAD) showed a very localised area of shellfish taint that, after exhaustive chemical fingerprinting analysis, was shown not to have been derived from the spilt oil. The offshore oil and gas industry also interacts with fishing fleets, as well as the fish resource. All surface installations and subsea structures, excluding pipelines, have a 500 m radius safety zone to exclude other sea users. Zones are normally patrolled by support vessels, and the proximity of fishing fleets can be monitored from the installations themselves. The loss of fishing area in the North Sea caused by these zones is less than 1%. The exclusion of fishing activity from these zones does not adversely affect fish catch rates, as fishing effort is simply diverted to other regions. The loss of area does not result in a proportional loss of catch, and the individual zones themselves are so small that they do not completely obscure any one fishing ground. It has been thought that these safety zones may act as closed areas, protecting populations and individuals from capture by fishing gears and thereby enhancing the stock. There is little evidence to support this assertion. Where possible, structures on the sea bed that could snag fishing gears are surrounded by a safety zone and provided with further protection. All sub-sea structures outside this zone are designed to be over-trawlable and have sloping sides to deflect trawls. Pipelines are protected by the addition of a protective coating or by burial. A range of potentially toxic materials can be discharged with produced water, including heavy metals, PAHs and production chemicals. The quantities of discharged produce water by the offshore industry have recently been reduced using techniques which rely on the reinjection into the reservoir. The Offshore Chemical Notification Scheme has ensured that the discharge of oil and contaminants in produced water is now the subject of increased control. There are now well established means of liaison between the fishing industry and offshore oil and gas industry, and claims for compensation and general safety issues are dealt with promptly. UKOOA and the fishing industry run a non-attributable compensation claims scheme, which considers claims for loss or damage to fishing gears, paid out of a central fund. There is also a joint Government and industry forum, the Fisheries and Offshore Operators Consultative Group (FOOCG), where representatives of the UK fishing industry, the oil and gas industry, seismic operators and key Government departments can raise and discuss industry concerns, and advise on best practice. There is, therefore, a relatively high level of communication and co-operation between the two industries.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"CEFAS, Lowestoft Laboratory, Lowestoft, United Kingdom",,,,2001-01-01,ZOOREC:ZOOR14110061969,,

There are some challenges with respect to CSEM in this particular area: 1) strong airwave influence (due to regional shallow water depth); 2) potential of weak resistivity anomaly; 3) seabed pipeline network; and 4) rather shallow target depth. We are yet able to extract useful information; interpret further the CSEM inversion results by combining seismic data; and to extract the in situ resistivity and saturation of CO2 in the Utsira formation by applying a rock physics model. In addition, to minimize the influence of the seabed pipeline on the CSEM data, we have muted some of data and receivers near the seabed pipeline network. The results show a good agreement with seismic data, and the estimated total mass of CO2 agrees well with the injection data. This current study confirms that the marine CSEM can be an important and essential tool for offshore CO2 storage monitoring, yet not alone but when combined with both seismic and gravity. Finally, near-future large-scale CCS projects in the North Sea would require extensive infra-structures such as seabed pipeline, etc. This study demonstrates that CSEM may work even with such infra-structures in place.

The biogenic structures that provide this nursery function, however, are increasingly degraded. Therefore, any effort to conserve, restore or replace habitat with artificial structure should be guided by an understanding of the value provided by that nursery habitat. Here, we experimentally manipulated structure across a number of sites by inserting pinnind bivalve mimics into the seabed and deploying video cameras to observe the response of post-settlement stage snapper, Chrysophrys auratus (Forster in Bloch and Schneider 1801). We also collected a range of environmental variables across these sites to determine the relative importance to snapper of benthic vs. pelagic productivity. While the abundance of snapper was low, our results demonstrated a strong association to structure relative to control plots. The environmental variable with the highest correlation to snapper abundance was the abundance of zooplankton eaten by snapper. This result was well supported by the dominance of zooplankton over small benthic invertebrates in snapper gut contents, and the weak influence of benthic infauna in our regression models. These regressions also demonstrated that when combined with zooplankton abundance, turbidity had a negative relationship to snapper abundance. This highlights the importance of relatively clear water in estuaries, which allows post-settlement snapper to more efficiently consume the zooplankton that are present in the water column. The third component that post-settlement snapper require is of course the presence of benthic structure. While benthic habitat structure was the strongest factor affecting juvenile snapper abundance, we did not find any correlations to suggest that this importance was related to energetic sheltering and access to locations with high food flux.

J,,,Department of Fisheries and Oceans,,,,,,,,ASSESSMENT OF THE EFFECTIVENESS OF MITIGATION MEASURES IN REDUCING THE POTENTIAL IMPACTS OF OIL AND GAS EXPLORATION AND PRODUCTION ON AREAS WITH DEFINED BENTHIC CONSERVATION OBJECTIVES.,,,,,,,,Canadian Science Advisory Secretariat Science Advisory Report,,,,25,,,,1,23,,,,,,,,,,,Article,Jul 2019,2019,"BACKGROUND The Government of Canada is committed to increasing the amount of conserved coastal and marine areas in Canada to 10% by 2020, as agreed to through international Aichi Biodiversity Target 11 and domestic Biodiversity Target 1. To achieve this goal, marine protected areas (MPAs) and other effective area-based conservation measures (OEABCMs) (Fisheries Act closures that meet Government of Canada criteria for OEABCMs) are being established. Many MPAs and OEABCMs have defined benthic conservation objectives. Defined benthic conservation objectives can include the protection of: benthic species (fish and invertebrates); benthic habitats including benthic spawning, nursery or feeding grounds; and Significant Benthic Areas, which include communities dominated by corals and/or sponges and hydrothermal vents, or locations likely to contain them such as canyons, seamounts, etc. By their nature, areas with defined benthic conservation objectives including MPAs and OEABCMs warrant a high(er) degree of risk aversion to anthropogenic activities than areas with no defined conservation objective. Oceans Management has requested national science advice on the effectiveness of existing mitigation measures in reducing the impacts of oil and gas exploration and production activities in Canadian waters, including seismic and drilling, on areas with defined benthic conservation objectives (such as MPAs and OEABCMs). Oceans Management sought this advice to inform policy related to oil and gas activities in areas with defined benthic conservation objectives. The advice may also be of interest to other sectors within Fisheries and Oceans Canada (DFO), other federal departments, and oil and gas industry partners. Oil and gas operations and regulation The three main phases of marine based oil and gas activities are exploration, development and production, and decommissioning. The exploration phase may include electromagnetic and/or seismic surveys to identify potential oil and gas reservoirs, and drilling into formations (exploration drilling) to determine whether the identified reservoirs contain hydrocarbons. Following the determination that hydrocarbons are present in commercially-viable quantities, the development and production phase can begin. Development includes infrastructure planning and drilling of development wells, and production is the period during which a field and its associated pipelines (as applicable) and infrastructure are used to produce oil or gas. When the field is exhausted, the wells are plugged and abandoned, and production infrastructure is decommissioned. The lead regulators for offshore oil and gas exploration and production activities in Atlantic Canada are the Canada-Nova Scotia Offshore Petroleum Board (CNSOPB) and the Canada-Newfoundland and Labrador Offshore Petroleum Board (C-NLOPB) which are joint federal-provincial agencies reporting to federal and provincial Ministers. Rights to explore for, develop and produce offshore petroleum resources are administered by these Boards in their respective jurisdictions and require environmental assessment under the respective legislation of the Boards and/or the Canadian Environmental Assessment Act, 2012. Offshore oil and gas activities are also regulated by Fisheries and Oceans Canada under the Fisheries Act, Species at Risk Act and Oceans Act. For more information on oil and gas regulation please refer to the CNSOPB and C-NLOPB websites. The Arctic and Pacific Oceans are currently under moratoria for oil and gas exploration and development. Areas with defined benthic conservation objectives Areas with defined benthic conservation objectives refer to area-based management measures (such as MPAs and OEABCMs) applied to protect benthic components defined in conservation objectives. Defined benthic conservation objectives can include the protection of: benthic species (fish and invertebrates); benthic habitats including benthic spawning, nursery or feeding grounds; and Significant Benthic Areas, which include communities dominated by corals and/or sponges and hydrothermal vents, or locations likely to contain them such as canyons, seamounts, etc. The areas in question for this review are those where a higher vulnerability to anthropogenic activities can often be inferred, or where vulnerability has been explicitly identified. Therefore, a lower threshold of impact and a higher expectation of mitigation would be more appropriate. In addition, because the areas are subject to conservation objectives, a precautionary approach and ecosystem approach are recommended within these areas. Management of activities, including oil and gas exploration and production activities, within areas with defined benthic conservation objectives should, therefore, include a higher risk aversion than management of activities in areas without these objectives. Currently, beyond ensuring that infrastructure placement does not cause direct destruction of individual organisms/colonies in these areas, current oil and gas exploration and production management practices do not distinguish between areas with and without defined benthic conservation objectives in terms of the habitat-scale features and processes that they provide. SCOPE The objectives of the science peer review meeting were to provide advice on the potential impacts of oil and gas exploration and production on areas with defined benthic conservation objectives and to assess the effectiveness of potential mitigation measures in the Canadian context. A subset of activities related to oil and gas exploration and production was reviewed; including seismic surveys, controlled source electromagnetic surveys and geotechnical / geohazard surveys that may involve the placement of structures on the bottom or physical collection of bottom samples (cores/grabs), and drilling-related activities which may have direct or indirect impacts on areas with defined benthic conservation objectives. Other activities related to oil and gas exploration and production - in particular accidental events (e.g., chronic and catastrophic spills) - but also including decommissioning, and ancillary activities related to the oil and gas industry such as cable installation and boat traffic were not addressed. A recent review of oil spills was conducted by the Royal Society of Canada (Lee et al. 2015); however, this review did not examine oil spills in relation to areas with defined benthic conservation objectives (e.g., coral and sponge habitats). In addition, the current review focused on offshore activities, without explicitly addressing that impacts and mitigation measures are likely to be different between offshore and nearshore/estuarine environments, and will differ in Arctic environments. This evaluation reviewed the extent and significance of oil and gas exploration and production activities in areas with defined benthic conservation objectives in Canadian waters, and the existing mitigation measures to reduce those impacts. Maps depicting a snapshot of federal areas with defined benthic conservation objectives, locations of offshore petroleum licences, and call for bid areas (areas that are presently open for bids; these areas do not guarantee issuance of exploration licences) are provided for the Canadian Atlantic (Figure 2), Arctic (Figure 3), and Pacific Ocean (Figure 4).",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"National Capital Region, Fisheries and Oceans Canada, 200, Kent Street, Ottawa, Ontario, K1A 0E6, Canada",,,,2019-11-18,ZOOREC:ZOOR15512081518,,

Artificial hard substrate, such as that associated with oil and gas platforms, provides settlement opportunities for species adapted to hard substrates in areas of soft sediment. The contribution of artificial hard substrate and the consequences of its removal (e.g. through decommissioning) to marine connectivity is not clear, yet such information is vital to inform marine spatial planning and future policy decisions on the use and protection of marine resources. This study demonstrates the application of a social network analysis approach to quantify and describe the ecological connectivity, informed by particle tracking model outputs, of hard substrate marine communities in the North Sea. Through comparison of networks with and without artificial hard substrate, and based on hypothetical decommissioning scenarios, this study provides insight into the contribution of artificial hard substrate, and the consequence of decommissioning, to the structure and function of marine community connectivity. This study highlights that artificial hard substrate, despite providing only a small proportion of the total area of hard substrate, increases the geographic extent and connectivity of the hard substrate network, bridging gaps, thereby providing 'stepping stones' between otherwise disconnected areas of natural hard substrate. Compared to the baseline scenario, a decommissioning scenario with full removal of oil and gas platforms results in a nearly 60% reduction in connectivity. Such reduction in connectivity may have negative implications for species' distribution, gene flow and resilience following disturbance or exploitation of marine hard substrate communities. Synthesis and applications. Social network analysis can provide valuable insight into connectivity between marine communities and enable the evaluation of impacts associated with changes to the marine environment. Providing standardized, transparent and robust outputs, such a tool is useful to facilitate understanding across different disciplines, including marine science, marine spatial planning and marine policy. Social network analysis therefore has great potential to address current knowledge gaps with respect to marine connectivity and crucially facilitate assessment of the impacts of changes in offshore substrate as part of the marine spatial planning process, thereby informing policy and marine management decisions.",,,,,,,,,16,0,0,0,6,0,16,,,0021-8901,1365-2664,,,,,,,,,,"CEFAS, Weymouth Lab, Weymouth, EnglandNIOZ Royal Netherlands Inst Sea Res, Dept Coastal Syst, Den Burg, NetherlandsUniv Utrecht, Den Burg, NetherlandsCEFAS, Lowestoft Lab, Lowestoft, Suffolk, EnglandUniv East Anglia, Norwich Res Pk, Sch Environm Sci, Norwich, England",,,,2020-01-24,WOS:000507069800001,,

Fit-for-the-purpose assessment is carried out to identify data adequacy for OWF siting per key variable in air, water, biota, seabed and human activity areas and per data characteristics, e.g. spatiotemporal coverage, resolution, timeliness, quality and accessibility. Major data gaps lie in observations of wind profiles, currents, sea ice thickness, bottom slope, sedimentation rate, grain size and transport. The results suggest that a community marine data service for OWF siting should be an integrated data portal with open and free data access. It should be a one-stop shop containing both raw data from satellite, in-situ, modelling, socio-economy and OWF sector, but more importantly tailored products which will allow performing feasibility siting on national scale.",,,,,,,,,7,0,0,0,1,0,7,,,1755-876X,1755-8778,,,,,,,,,,"Danish Meteorol Inst, Dept Res & Dev, Lyngbyvej 100, DK-2100 Copenhagen, Denmark",,,,2019-08-27,WOS:000480851200001,,

Despite considerable investment, it is unclear how the scale of and approaches toward oyster restoration have evolved. A synthesis of 1768 projects undertaken since 1964 reveals that oyster substrate restoration efforts have primarily been concentrated in the Chesapeake Bay and the Gulf Coast, have been heavily reliant on oyster shell, and have re-established 4.5% of the reef area that has been lost across all regions. By comparing costs to ecosystem service benefits, we discovered that the return-on-investment of oyster restoration varies widely, but generally increases with project size.

Two commonly used, but structurally different, artificial substrates include cylindrical PVC pipes and flat ceramic tiles. Various ecosystem based models extrapolate data from these substrates interchangeably based on the assumption that results are directly comparable. In order to test this assumption we deployed these commonly used artificial substrate materials, PVC poles and ceramic tiles, in shallow patch reefs for 34 months at One Tree Island, Great Barrier Reef. Tiles were positioned to mimic upwards facing, well-lit substrates (exposed), and downwards facing, shaded (cryptic) substrates. Multivariate analyses demonstrated that the community composition differed significantly between all three treatments. The majority of artificial substrate, coral reef experiments focus on key groups of calcifying organisms, primarily: coralline algae, scleractinian coral and/or total calcareous encruster cover. Interestingly, significant differences in the recruitment, colonisation and community composition of these organisms were detected for our three treatments. When compared to ceramic tiles, PVC poles had greater coverage of crustose coralline algae but reduced levels of coral recruits (<1 mm diameter) and turf algae. We suggest that comparisons between studies that utilise data from different substrate types should be used with caution. Additionally, large scale modelling and forecasting exercises utilising these data sets should adjust for the inherent biases of each method. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

These structures have been shown to be important habitats for both settlement and growth for reef fishes. Important information on the biological effects (i.e., loss of biomass and production) of different decommissioning options has not yet been explored in detail. An important step in the assessment of these different decommissioning options is to look at the potential loss of fish production and habitat under the different alternatives. Using the large amount of information available on fish abundances at these structures, we have created a model to estimate the standing stock of fishes and production that would be lost because of both partial (removal from surface to 85 ft) and complete removal (the 2 decommissioning options being considered). Complete removal of a platform will likely eliminate most of its fish biomass; however, this study has shown that for rockfishes, which settle predominantly below 85 feet (26 m) and move deeper as they age, partial removal through topping would leave more than 90% of the fish biomass at the deeper platforms. Modeling of larval dispersal suggests that platforms provide an important opportunity for recruitment of fish larvae and that many larvae produced near the platforms would settle elsewhere in the region. The results presented here indicate that, even if topped, the potential contribution of platform habitat to biological resources (e.g., fish production) in this region is significant.

We studied the spatial ecology of European shags (Phalacrocorax aristotelis) in Normandy, France, where > 1% of the species' world population, and ca. 20% of its French population breeds. Working on 29 breeding individuals at two colonies (Chausey and Saint-Marcouf), we performed the first GPS-tracking study for the species in this region. On the basis of GPS positions and dive information across 244 foraging trips, we present a general methodological framework to map existing, and model potential seabird habitats. Shags performed dives between 9 and 17 h, and fed at average distances of 5.3 km (Chausey) and 3.3 km (Saint-Marcouf) from their nests. They used 186 km(2) (Chausey) and 143 km(2) (Saint-Marcouf) areas with a depth < 15 m over rocky and sandy habitats. Shags selected areas with an SST around 18 degrees C (Chausey) and 12-13 degrees C (Saint-Marcouf). There is strong evidence that they are year-round residents in these coastal areas and we identified four major environmental changes to which they may react as spatial ecological indicators: climate change, which may impact them directly, or indirectly via shifting prey distributions; fisheries, which may target small pelagic fish such as sandeels, upon which they depend; sediment extraction which may remove benthic habitats critically important to sandeels; and marine windfarms which may result in feeding habitat loss.",,,,,,,,,6,0,0,0,4,0,6,,,0025-3162,1432-1793,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Montpellier, Univ Paul Valery Montpellier, EPHE, Ctr Ecol Fonct & Evolut,UMR 5175,CNRS, Montpellier, FranceUniv Cape Town, DST NRF Excellence Ctr, Percy FitzPatrick Inst, ZA-7701 Rondebosch, South AfricaGrp Ornithol Normand, 181 Rue Auge, F-14000 Caen, France",Grp Ornithol Normand,,,2020-03-03,WOS:000519214400005,,

The oil companies expected effects of their activities to be found to a 1 km radius round platforms. In the late 1980s data started appearing that suggested that effects were over much larger areas. These findings were disputed but subsequent studies showed that a more realistic figure of the area affected was a 3 km radius giving roughly 10 times the area predicted by the companies. The Norwegian authorities reacted by imposing restrictions on discharges of oil-based drilling cuttings and since 1993 oil-based drilling mud or cuttings have not been intentionally discharged to sea on the Norwegian shelf. In 1996 Norway changed its offshore monitoring from field based monitoring of sediments to a regional monitoring of both sediments and the water column, The change makes it possible to obtain a better overview of the environmental conditions, at the same time it also reduces costs for the operators.

It has been developed in close consultation with Oil & Gas UK and designed to feed into the Scottish Government's Marine Planning Interactive management tool, itself a valuable resource for the offshore industry. North Sea Interactive translates NERC environmental science from the British Geological Survey (BGS, surficial geology) and National Oceanography Centre (NOC, modelled hydrography) into a new Geographic Information System tool that incorporates the 40-year industry archive of benthic biology in the North Sea Benthos database (Oil & Gas UK/Heriot-Watt University, HWU). North Sea Interactive transfers people from NERC's research base through a series of consultations and secondments with Oil & Gas UK and the Scottish Government. These secondments allow us to develop North Sea Interactive as a practical tool, becoming a valuable Case Study for future development and extension to new exploration and production areas. North Sea Interactive will catalyse new ideas and Joint Industry Projects (JIPs). These include extensions to this project, such as incorporating additional biogeochemical parameters (e.g. pH, highly relevant to cuttings pile stability), through to using the North Sea Interactive approach in new areas such as the Atlantic Margins west of the UK.North Sea Interactive relies on the long history and close working relationships between its partners and the oil industry. HWU has worked with the offshore industry since the early 1970s. The HWU team has over 60 years combined experience of oil industry projects representing a unique collective experience of compiling and assessing benthic biological data for the oil and gas industry. The University has a strong working relationship with industry evident not only from its Institute of Petroleum Engineering (JIPs income £4.5m pa; JIPs lasting up to 12yrs), but also from the success of its oil industry-related spin-out companies (e.g. Epistemy, Hydrafact, Hydrason, Petroc Technologies, SeeByte). The BGS has an unrivalled position as a valued source of geoscience and regional geological information for the oil industry. Relationships vary from one-off contracts with individual operators to large, long-terms JIPs such as the 1995-2006 Western Frontiers Association (15 companies, £2.7m industry funding) and the 1992-2010 Rockall Consortium (14 companies, £7.34M industry funding). BGS success in such JIPs has catalysed partnerships with international academic consortia, such as the EC STRATAGEM and COSTA programmes.By providing a single tool that integrates NERC and oil industry environmental data, North Sea Interactive will assist operators in achieving best practicable environmental options (BPEO) for future oil field development, decommissioning options and post-decommissioning monitoring. It is designed to ensure ready access to high-quality NERC environmental data alongside industry datasets so helping companies meet their obligations (e.g. under the OSPAR Commission's national obligations to the 2010-14 Joint Assessment Monitoring Programme and the EU Marine Strategy Framework Directive). It provides a model for future JIPs to integrate academic and industry data notably along the Atlantic Margins where there are knowledge gaps in understanding of deep-water ecosystems and vulnerabilities to oil and gas activities. By creating what we believe will become one of the densest shelf seas datasets integrating biological, geological and hydrodynamic information from industry and academia, North Sea Interactive will become a catalyst for many new ideas and initiatives. As well as future enhancements (e.g. biogeochemical data layers) and expansions (e.g. Atlantic Margin), these include interfacing with regional habitat mapping (e.g. MAREMAP), providing base layers to the renewables industry and raft of potential JIPs around environmental monitoring and decommissioning issues.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,NE/L008165/1,,,,,,,,Heriot-Watt University,,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:15300447,,

As part of a larger policy analysis conducted for the State of California, we implemented a decision analysis as a software tool (PLATFORM) to clarify and evaluate decision strategies against a comprehensive set of objectives. Key options selected for in-depth analysis are complete platform removal and partial removal to 85 feet below the water line, with the remaining structure converted in place to an artificial reef to preserve the rich ecosystems supported by the platform's support structure. PLATFORM was instrumental in structuring and performing key analyses of the impacts of each option (e.g., on costs, fishery production, air emissions) and dramatically improved the team's productivity. Sensitivity analysis found that disagreement about preferences, especially about the relative importance of strict compliance with lease agreements, has much greater effects on the preferred option than does uncertainty about specific outcomes, such as decommissioning costs. It found a near-consensus of stakeholders in support of partial removal and rigs-to-reefs program. The project's results played a role in the decision to pass legislation enabling an expanded California rigs-to-reefs program that includes a mechanism for sharing cost savings between operators and the state.

As marine ecosystems degrade, so do the well-being and livelihoods of humans that depend directly on the ecosystem goods and services they provide. Marine protected areas have been proposed to protect biodiversity, restore damaged ecosystems, sustain fisheries, and rebuild overexploited stocks. The effectiveness of marine protected areas depends in part on their effectiveness as connected networks, linked over large areas by ecological processes such as larval dispersal. Here, we applied a biophysical model driven by ocean currents derived from satellite altimetry to evaluate connectivity between Western Indian Ocean reefs. We applied graph-theoretic analysis, including clustering and a betweenness centrality metric. Our results show high interconnectivity within several regions (Mozambique Channel, Mascarene archipelago) and lower connectivity across the WIO region. We compared the results with the current MPA network, and proposed sites/reefs that should be considered priority sites for MPA implementation: Pebane, Cosmoledo, Majunga, Masoarivo, Platte Island, Farquhar, Agalega and Geyser bank. Our results are timely, considering the oil and gas exploration that is ongoing in the region. We discuss implications for transboundary marine policies and regional cooperation in the Western Indian Ocean, and advocate the creation of a regional-scale organization to structure interactions among the different actors.

From the first Adriatic Sea implementation in its purely hydrodynamic configuration that traces back to more than ten years ago, to the last configuration under the Coupled Ocean-Atmosphere-Wave-Sediment Transport (COAWST) system, including wave-current-sediment interactions, several specific applications covering a wide range of spatial and temporal scales have been put forward, developed in a growing number of fields. Most of the ROMS-based Adriatic applications derive air-sea heat, momentum and water fluxes from the operational meteorological model COSMO-I7, the Italian implementation at 7 km horizontal resolution of COSMO (Consortium for Small-scale Modeling) Model, a limited-area non-hydrostatic model. Presently, a ROMS operational implementation provides every day hydrodynamic and sea level forecasts for the following three days at 2 km resolution, while another one implementing a Fasham-like module provides basic biogeochemical forecasts, and a third one at finer resolution (0.5 km in the northern sub-basin) two-way coupled with a wave-averaging model (Simulating Waves Nearshore, SWAN) is now well ahead in its pre-operational test phase. Such operational models provide support for several applications, from scientific to civil and environmental protection ones (e.g., driving specialized models for prediction of: oil-spill dispersion, storm surge, coastal morphodynamic changes during storms, saline wedge intrusion along Po River), in a growing context of stake-holders at regional, national and international level. Besides operational implementations, ROMS and COAWST research based activities are carried out, mostly aiming at investigating sediment transport, coastal dynamics and environmental aspects (e.g. circulation and thermohaline interannual variability, eggs and larvae dispersion of small pelagic fishes, hypoxic events) of this semi-enclosed sea, demonstrating the relevance of a numerical model having several state-of-the-art capabilities, such as advanced vertical mixing schemes, an up-to-date bottom boundary layer description, wetting and drying capabilities, wave-current interactions and biogeochemical modules, etc. Moreover, coupled applications using both one-way and two-way successive nesting allowed to reach very high resolutions nearshore the Italian coast, and to simulate river mouth environments and artificial reefs.

Fish species were distributed according to depth, with juveniles and small individuals being found in shallow waters, whereas larger individuals were found in deeper waters. However, depth by itself was not a significant factor in explaining fish species pattern, whereas sandy bottom habitat was significant. The most significant factors explaining fish species distribution were small and large blocks, and rock cover. juvenile labrids, such as the most abundant ones Coris julis and Symphodus ocellatus, were only rarely observed deeper than 10 in, and the distribution of these juveniles was mainly correlated with a cover of macroalgae, rubble and small blocks. Fish density and fish biomass were higher in shallow than in deeper waters, although some species displayed an opposite pattern, such as the adult of G julis and Diplodus sargus. The most significant factors explaining the fish density pattern found were the presence of macroalgae, Posidonia oceanica sea grass and sand cover. Among environmental factors assessed in this study, exposure to dominant winds was never significant, either for the whole fish assemblage or for juvenile labrids, or for the communities at any of the depth strata investigated. Depth was a significant factor influencing the distribution of juvenile labrids, whereas its significance in explaining fish density was lower. Bottom slope was generally more significant than depth, and thus constituted the most significant environmental factor. Benthic habitat characteristics were all significant, except for rubble cover, in explaining both fish species and fish density distributions. However, the amplitude of the relationships between substrate variables and fish assemblages was dependent on the descriptor studied (i.e. species distribution, including considerations of fish sizes, and fish density), suggesting that extrapolation of a particular relationship to other components of a fish assemblage would most likely be unfounded. Our results as a whole indicate that benthic habitat use by fish on Mediterranean rocky infralittoral coast is clearly non-random, and suggest that differences in habitat and/or environmental characteristics have significant effects at a small spatial scale on these fish assemblages.",,,,,,,,,56,0,0,0,46,3,59,,,0025-3154,,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Mediterranee, CNRS, UMR 6540, Ctr Oceanol Marseille, F-13288 Marseille 09, France",,,,2003-02-01,WOS:000181637500026,,

Sampling includes diver transects, ichthyoplankton tows, and air lift/quinaldene samples of settling recruits. During this 18-year study, two natural environmental events, the El Ninos of 1977-1979, 1982-1984 and destructive storm waves of winter 1988 have affected the assemblage. The change in water temperature in 1977 resulted in a significant change in species composition while the other events primarily affected abundance. Additionally, the reconstruction of the breakwater and dredging of the harbor in 1989 strongly affected the reproductive success of some species. Though, except during the above cited events, species number and overall fish abundance has remained relatively stable over the study period, individual species have fluctuated widely in abundance. Much of this fluctuation is the result of variable annual recruitment. The relationship between recruitment and various environmental factors are analyzed for a number of selected species which differ in life history and reproductive strategies. Even in the face of significant annual mortality from adult fish entrapment and larval entrainment by the Southern California Edison (SCE) intakes, the King Harbor breakwater continues to support a fish assemblage, more diverse and abundant than a natural reef/kelp bed at Pales Verdes Point that has been surveyed over the same period.

Along with this, otolith growth and morphology analyses were also applied to better understand the consequences for the ecology and growth performance of several fish species that use coastal farms as recruitment habitats in the southwestern Mediterranean Sea. Results showed that fish farms are acting as a new habitat for the settlement of juvenile fish and that detected abundance could be compared with that found at natural habitats such as shallow rocky environments. However, a consistent pattern for all the studied species was a significant variation in otolith-shape descriptors, principally identified through the Aspect Ratio index, which was lower for the farm-associated species Atherina boyeri, Oblada melanura, and Sarpa salpa. Otolith modifications were effectively detected by elliptic Fourier descriptors since multivariate analysis correctly identified farm or control origin at 78.8, 85.1, and 86.1% for A. boyeri, O. melanura, and S. salpa individuals, respectively.

However, whether people equally value natural ecosystems that they regularly frequent is effectively unknown. Such knowledge would greatly assist natural resource managers to better understand what they are protecting, why and for whom. In this paper we look at the different values that people hold for different ecosystems within the Great Barrier Reef (GBR). We test the relationship between eight different cultural values (using ecosystem services framing), and the use of seven different ecosystems (beaches, creeks and estuaries, islands and cays, inshore reefs, mid-shelf,and outer reefs, open water, and shipwrecks) from face-to-face surveys of 1934 residents living within the GBR. We also look at whether the relationships that people have with each ecosystem inspires them to; (i) do more to help protect the GBR, (ii) learn more about the GBR, and (iii) feel personally affected if the health of the GBR declines. Results suggest that there are common reasons why all ecosystems are valued. All seven ecosystems were valued because they provide identity, quality of life and wellbeing, and inspired people to do more to help protect the GBR. Many were valued for their desirable and active way of life, learning about the environment through scientific discoveries, and learning about the condition of the GBR. However, some ecosystems were valued for special reasons. People that used beaches tended to have more pride in the World Heritage Area status of the GBR and appreciated the aesthetics of the GBR. People that used the mid-shelf and open-water areas were more likely to value biodiversity and aesthetics qualities. People that used inshore reefs were more likely to value economic benefits from the GBR. All residents said that they would be personally affected if the health of the GBR declined, except for those that used beaches, creeks and estuaries. Levels of concern for each of the ecosystems within the GBR varied, where people were more concerned about inshore areas than they were about coral reef condition. Specifically, people were most concerned about the level of rubbish on the beaches in their region and least about mangroves. These results suggest that, even though the GBR is valued in its entirety for many reasons, the GBR is not perceived as an entire ecosystem, but that people have different relationships within it.

The region has a mixed history; healthy populations of many species exist, but so do species extinctions (e.g. Steller sea cow, Hydrodamalis gigas) and population depletions, including the sea otter (Enhydra lutris), Steller sea lion (Eumetopias jubatus), whiskered auklets (Aethia pygmaea), Pacific ocean perch (Sebastes alutus), and red king crabs (Paralithodes camtschaticus), associated with human impacts. The solution to our limited knowledge in this poorly studied region is increased funding for ecosystem research, including its responses to climate change and human impacts. Knowledge is not sufficient, however; a change in management approach is also needed. We emphasize the need to maintain a broader set of ecosystem services objectives rather than the traditional narrower focus on commercial fishery yields. To do so, we recommend the development of an integrated ecosystem services management plan for the Aleutian Islands.

This study used baited remote underwater video stations to determine spatial patterns in fish assemblages associated with rocky reef habitat throughout a barrier estuary with a permanently open but restricted inlet. Estuarine rocky reefs provided habitat for a diverse assemblage of fishes, many of which were large juveniles and subadults. In the absence of a pronounced salinity or temperature gradient, a clear transition in fish assemblages occurred from coastal waters, through the inlet channel, to the central estuary, and into the inner estuary. The inlet channel, notably its narrowness and length, limits tidal input into this estuary, which acts as a significant impediment to the dispersal of many coastal fishes, and insufficient habitat excludes many coastal rocky reef species from the inner estuary.

The macroalgal population of the horizontal surfaces of the four cubes was seasonally sampled over one and a half years. A qualitative analysis based on a floristic survey of all species present did not reveal significant differences between treatments. However, the quantitative analysis of the algal community based on biomass samples revealed marked differences. Before starting the experiment, fresh and dry weights of the vegetation of all four cubes were of comparable magnitude, while after deployment of the netting, biomass on the two surfaces protected by the net was always significantly higher than in the controls throughout the sampling period.

In June 1993 and January 1994, genetic diversity of Harpacticoida (Copepoda) living proximal to operating, offshore platforms in the Gulf of Mexico was estimated to test if platforms are associated with strong selective pressures. Because harpacticoids have short generation times and direct benthic development, they are suitable organisms for examining population responses. Genetic diversity was estimated by comparing restriction fragment length polymorphisms generated from mitochondrial DNA amplified by the polymerase chain reaction on individuals of five species (Cletodes sp., Enhydrosoma pericoense, Normanella sp., Robertsonia sp., and Tachidiella sp.). Populations living at Near regions (stations < 50 m from a platform) had significantly less haplotype diversity than populations of the same species living at Far regions (stations > 3 km from a platform). The levels of haplotype diversity exhibited by the Far populations were similar at three different platforms located hundreds of kilometers apart. The differences in haplotype diversity between Near and Far regions were the result of a higher proportion of dominant haplotypes, and a loss of less common haplotypes. Haplotypic diversity was inversely correlated with a multivariate measurement of levels of sediment contaminants. The pattern of haplotype diversity on the Gulf of Mexico continental shelf seems to consist of a uniform level of haplotype diversity, punctuated by islands of lower diversity around oil and gas platforms. The selective pressures that lead to a loss of genetic diversity may be the result of contaminants, other differences in the physico-chemical environment, or disturbance in general.",,,,,,,,,42,1,0,0,17,0,43,,,0025-3162,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1996-08-01,WOS:A1996VH65800012,,

This is particularly true for many shellfish (molluscan) dominated systems (e.g. oyster reefs, mussel beds, vermetid gastropod reefs). In contrast to other well-studied biogenic habitats, such as seagrasses, mangroves, or salt marshes, bivalves are directly consumed as a resource. Hence resource extraction has direct consequences for habitat health. Restoration objectives have typically included reduction of public health risks through improved water quality to increase harvest. Restoration or enhancement of populations of commercially exploited shellfish depressed by overharvesting and/or reduced environmental quality remains the principal motivation behind most shellfish 'restoration' efforts. Direct and indirect ecosystem services (e.g. filtering capacity, benthic-pelagic coupling, nutrient dynamics, sediment stabilization, provision of habitat, etc.) derived fi om oyster habitat have been largely ignored or underestimated. Only recently, the restoration of lost ecological function associated with shellfish communities has been included in our discussions and related research examining habitat development and function through a scientific approach. The former area has been reviewed extensively and will not be out focus here. In this review, we examine some of the restoration efforts made in the name of fisheries enhancement, address their effectiveness, and discuss some of the issues associated with realizing the broader goal of ecological restoration. We note the importance of linking success criteria to specific goals and make the case for. a gl cater need in clarifying the ecological functions of shellfish and shellfish habitats. We recognize the limitations of existing datasets and summarize ongoing attempts to address oyster habitat restoration throughout the broad geographic distribution of the American oyster, Crassostrea virginica (Gmelin). In many ways this topic parallels the ongoing debate over 'attraction versus production' associated with artificial reef management. We consider how local conditions (e.g. tidal range, bottom topography, turbidity, salinity) and resulting habitat traits affect restoration strategies. We also discuss the underappreciated value of shellfish populations from those areas designated as closed to harvesting due to their intrinsic worth as habitat/larval reserves. The necessity of ecosystem (adaptive) management strategies emerges from this discussion. Finally, this overview supports our contention that shellfish habitat should be included in discussions of 'essential fish habitats' (or EFH). (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

The amount of rocky reef habitat has significandy decreased; as such, determining the optimum technique for restoring this lost habitat is the focus of this study. Over the past decade, we mapped and intensively surveyed the nearshore physical and biological characteristics both inside this impacted area and in surrounding reference areas that contain extensive rocky reef habitat with established kelp forests. Notable among all survey locations is a relatively high-relief (similar to 5 m) area of reef within the sediment impacted area that consistently has the highest fish bio-mass density among anywhere on the peninsula. The high structural relief prevents sediment accumulation, scour, and subsequent reef burial, and this reef ultimately served as the example for the design of sets of quarry rock reef blocks that together form the proposed restoration reef. Our primary objective was to use the 63,500 metric tons of quarry rock the budget would allow us to create the most productive habitat by restoring the natural reef environment while balancing scientific study design considerations (i.e., replicated reef components at multiple spatial scales) with maximizing the potential for an effective restoration effort across the range of important species and overall kelp forest biodiversity. To meet this objective, we considered multiple criteria that incorporated engineering specifications and biological performance and were informed by the scientific literature and results of natural and artificial reef surveys in this region. Ultimately, the design incorporated heterogeneity at multiple spatial scales while attempting to maximize high relief components, surface area to volume ratio, perimeter, ecotones, and small-scale current flow features and nutrient flux and while being consistent with the size of natural reefs along the Palos Verdes Peninsula. Further, placement and spacing of individual reef blocks (i.e., 2 X 48 m heterogeneous quarry rock reefs) included space for sand channels between blocks to permit sediment transport and create sand/rock ecotone habitats while remaining close enough to each other and existing natural reefs to maintain biological connectivity. Reef blocks were also located at the depth (15-20 m) where the most productive reef habitat in the region was observed. Finally, we discuss a proposed pre- and post-construction monitoring program and additional studies that could be performed that would leverage the replicated elements in the restoration reef design to inform future reef restoration programs.",,,,,Symposium on Marine Artificial Reef Research and Development: Integrating Fisheries Management ObjectivesSymposium on Marine Artificial Reef Research and Development: Integrating Fisheries Management Objectives,"AUG 22-23, 2017AUG 22-23, 2017",,"Tampa, FLTampa, FL",5,0,0,0,4,0,5,,,0892-2284,,978-1-934874-51-6,,,,,,,,,"Occidental Coll, Vantuna Res Grp, 1600 Campus Rd, Los Angeles, CA 90041 USACalif State Polytech Univ Pomona, Biol Sci Dept, 3801 West Temple Ave, Pomona, CA 91768 USANOAA, Montrose Settlements Restorat Program, 501 West Ocean Blvd,Suite 4470, Long Beach, CA 90802 USA",,,,2019-02-13,WOS:000456750700010,,

Cryptic and exposed communities differ considerably in species composition and ecological function. This study compares three different coral reef assessment protocols: i) visual benthic reef surveys: ii) visual census of Autonomous Reef Monitoring Structures (ARMS) plates; and iii) metabarcoding techniques of the ARMS (including sessile, 106-500 mu m and 500-2000 mu m size fractions), that target the cryptic and exposed communities of three reefs in the central Red Sea. Visual census showed a dominance of Cnidaria (Anthozoa) and Rhodophyta on the reef substrate, while Porifera, Bryozoa and Rhodophyta were the most abundant groups on the ARMS plates. Metabarcoding, targeting the 18S rRNA gene, significantly increased estimates of the species diversity (p < 0.001); revealing that Annelida were generally the dominant phyla (in terms of reads) of all fractions and reefs. Furthermore, metabarcoding detected microbial eukaryotic groups such as Syndiniophyceae, Mamiellophyceae and Bacillariophyceae as relevant components of the sessile fraction. ANOSIM analysis showed that the three reef sites showed no differences based on the visual census data. Metabarcoding showed a higher sensitivity for identifying differences between reef communities at smaller geographic scales than standard visual census techniques as significant differences in the assemblages were observed amongst the reefs. Comparison of the techniques showed no similar patterns for the visual techniques while the metabarcoding of the ARMS showed similar patterns amongst fractions. Establishing ARMS as a standard tool in reef monitoring will not only advance our understanding of local processes and ecological community response to environmental changes, as different faunal components will provide complementary information but also improve the estimates of biodiversity in coral reef benthic communities. This study lays the foundations for further studies looking at integrating traditional reef survey methodologies with complementary approaches, such as metabarcoding, which investigate other components of the reef community.

Subsequent surveys revealed CM to be overgrowing the reef benthos, including corals and coralline algae, potentially placing coral ecosystems in the atoll at risk. This prompted the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, the lead management agency of the atoll, to remove the shipwreck. Subsequent surveys showed reductions in CM around the ship impact site. We explain patterns of spread of the CM in terms of both life history and local currents and show with a pilot study that pulverized bleach may be an effective tool to eradicate CM on a local scale.

J,,,,,,,,,Thomas Wilding,,Development of a strategic framework for the comparative assessment of pipeline decommissioning options: optimising environment and fishing interests,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Awarded Grant,Feb 14 2017,2017,"BackgroundAs part of the exploitation of UK Continental Shelf (UKCS) oil and gas (O&G), more than 27,000 km of pipelines have been installed since the 1960s. To date, only 2% have been decommissioned and there has been little research on the consequences of decommissioning to other industries and the environment [1]. Over the next 6-8 years, approximately 5,600 km of pipelines will require decommissioning on the UKCS [2]. Pipeline decommissioning is considered on a case-by-case basis, by the comparative assessment of the available decommissioning options [3]. As part of the comparative assessment, operators must demonstrate to the regulator (the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy - BEIS) that any proposed strategy meets international obligations to ensure the safety of fishing and protection of the marine environment. In order to do so, a comprehensive evidence-base and a strategic framework for assessing pipeline decommissioning with respect to fishing and environmental interests is required.The commercial fishing industry is one of largest users of the UK continental shelf (UKCS), and it is known that there is substantial spatial overlap between pipeline infrastructure and fishing [4]. The presence of decommissioned pipelines on the seabed, without rock dump, presents a potential snagging risk to fishers, according to the type of pipeline, seabed type, fishing intensity and gear-type. The UKCS also contains a number of internationally important conservation features (habitats and species), such as those listed in the EU Habitats Directive (e.g. cold-water corals) and those that are included within designated marine protected areas. These conservation features/species (CF/S) are potentially sensitive to pipeline decommissioning as a result of physical impacts, sediment disturbances and the removal of hard substratum which provides additional habitat for the CF/S and/or protection from trawling damage. ObjectiveThis project will result in the quantification of the risks/benefits of all pipeline decommissioning options to both fishing and the environment and the integration of these risks to find the optimal decommissioning solution for each pipe (from the fisher/environmental perspective). This will be achieved by:1. Combining and collating knowledge of species-pipeline associations gained from analysis of video footage of pipelines (collected routinely by the industry for integrity monitoring), spatial data on fishing patterns and snagging incidents, and data on the distribution and sensitivities of CF/S.2. Developing spatial 'risk-layers' that can be flexibly combined to evaluate and minimise the relative risks to conservation interests and fishers, across all UKCS pipelines, from all feasible decommissioning options.3. Embedding the resulting assessment into decommissioning protocols.Impacts and beneficiariesThe main beneficiaries of the project will be the UK Government, their advisors [5], fishers and the oil and gas industry who will benefit from an enhanced evidence-base that is shared across all sectors. The outputs of the project will facilitate cost-effective, rapid, consistent and transparent decision-making in relation to pipeline decommissioning.REFERENCES[1] Oil and Gas UK (2013), Decommissioning of pipelines in the North Sea region[2] Oil and Gas UK (2014), Decommissioning Insight 2014[3] Department for Energy and Climate Change (2011), Decommissioning of Offshore Oil and Gas Installations and Pipelines under the Petroleum Act[4] PipeFish - Optimising the decommissioning of oil and gas pipelines with respect to commercial fishing at the scale of the UK continental shelf.

J,"Dalkin, M.",,,,,,,,,,Mid Irish Sea reefs habitat mapping report.,,,,,,,,JNCC Report,,,,411,,,,i,"ii, 1-113",,,,,,,,,,,Article,August 2008,2008,"Funding for this work has been provided by the Department for Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA) Natural Environment Group Science Division (Contract No CRO 361). The aim of this research contract was to improve understanding of the habitats and communities present in an area of the Irish Sea identified as potentially containing Annex I reef habitat according to the Habitats Directive. The potential Annex I reef area for this area was roughly delineated using British Geological Survey (BGS) 1:250,000 Seabed Sediment data (Graham., 2001). This area of habitat represented a number of polygons of quaternary sediment and rock according to the modified version of the Folk classification scheme used by BGS, and may consist of particles from am diameter up to cobbles and boulders. To investigate and characterise the habitats and biotopes of an area of potential reef in the mid Irish Sea, new acoustic survey and biological survey was undertaken. The extent and distribution of the habitats and communities with the target area were mapped, and an assessment was made as to whether any of the habitats found fit within the interpretation of Annex I reef according to the Habitats Directive. Survey cruises were undertaken in November 2006 and January 2007 onboard the University Marine Biological Station, Millport (UMBSM) Research Vessel Aora, with specialists from the National Oceanography Centre (NOC), ERT (Scotland) Ltd (ERT), UMBSM and Seatronics Ltd. In discussion with JNCC, the survey area was split into three sections covering the northern, central and southern patches of potential reef identified by BGS. In spite of bad winter weather and technical issues with camera equipment, the survey successfully collected acoustic data from target areas within the central Irish Sea and sufficient ground-truthing data to enable the classification and mapping of seabed habitats for the northern part of the survey area. Further acoustic data will be required to map the central survey area, and further ground-truthing data will be required to map both the southern and central areas. The surveyed depth ranged from approximately 60 to 155m. The shallowest depths were located on the western side of the southern survey area deepening gradually to the east and north. The deepest area was found in the south eastern corner of the northern survey area where a trough, approximately 2 km wide, deepened from a surrounding seabed of 90m to approximately 155m in its centre. There was a trend across the whole survey area of increasing depth from west to east, towards the deepest part of the Saint George's Channel. The sandiest sediments were found in the sand wave field in the north of the northern survey area in depths of less than 90m. The transition to coarser sandy sediments with an increased percentage of shell debris, pebbles and gravel followed an abrupt transition away from the sand wave field and this was reflected in both the bathymetry and backscatter data. The area of coarse sandy sediments covered the majority of the northern survey area at 90m. In deeper ground more stable mixed sediments became dominant. Sparse patches of small boulders were found at several sites. The biotopes identified from the survey were a close fit to those present in version 04.05 of the marine habitat classification (Connor et al., 2004) but with the exception of SS.SSa.OSa, occurred in depths greater than those used to describe circalittoral biotopes. The cut-off between CMx and OMx appeared to occur at 50m, and yet both SS.SCS.CCS.PomB and SS.SMx.CMx.FluHyd were present in depths of 90 to 120m. It may be that the depth bands of the circalittoral biotopes should be extended to cover slightly deeper habitats, or further species data should be collected to establish of there is subtle difference in characteristic fauna that could be used to define new biotope equivalents to SS.SCS.CCS.PomB and SS.SMx.CMx.FluHyd in the offshore section of the classification. Patches of cobbles and boulder habitat 25 to 50m2 were observed at several locations. The sparseness of these patches, and also the inclusion of cobbles and boulders in SS.SMx.CMx.FluHyd led to these areas being classified as sediment, rather than rocky habitat within ver. 04.05 marine habitat classification. The greatest abundance of cobble and boulder habitat occurred in sites 15, 16, 27 and 32.Using the broader JNCC interpreted definition of Annex I reefs (Johnston et al., 2002), it was apparent that areas within the SS.SMx.OMx/SS.SMx.CMx.FluHyd mapped area could be considered Annex I reef habitat. The problem encountered in identifying such patches within the survey area was that it is difficult to resolve these from the surrounding mixed sediments from 16m pixel backscatter and 5m pixel bathymetry. With further analysis it would be possible to highlight areas for further ground-truthing from the backscatter data, but it may be that detailed side-scan sonar survey of the SS.SMx.OMx /SS.SMx.CMx.FluHyd would have been the most accurate way of delineating such patches.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,0963-8091,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2008-08-01,ZOOREC:ZOOR14503018413,,

To date, 26 lobsters (14 female, 12 male) have been tagged, up to seven have been monitored simultaneously and four individuals have been tracked for over 6 months. Movements between units of the artificial reef (over open seabed away from shelter) were predominantly nocturnal, although daytime movements occurred during periods of low light levels associated with increased turbidity resulting from wave action. A marked decline in the number of inter-reef movements from late summer to winter was most closely related to decreasing water temperature.

Could those decline be alleviated by deploying artificial reefs (ARs) in suitable areas? This study investigates effects of a big project conducted in December 2007 that deployed ARs in the southwestern part of Daya Bay. The ARs cover a total dimension of 966.10 x 2850.60 m(2) and surface area of 91,500 m2. This study analyzed the spatial and temporal variations of ecological factors, including Chlorophyll a concentrations (Chl-a), nutrients, attaching organisms and nekton resources, on and around the ARs using both satellite (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer, MODIS) and in situ data. Results showed that the potential affected area of ARs in Daya Bay reached a distance of 4.9 km in the water depth of 12.0-15.2 m. In the study area, Chl-a level reached 2.93 mg m(-2) during the post-AR period (2008-2012), that was higher than the pre-AR period (2002-2007) (2.37 mg m(-2)). Nekton biomass increased by 4.66-16.22 times compared with that in the pre-AR survey, and the species diversity increased by 15%-23%. This parallel trend suggested that ARs might have contribution to the increase in nekton biomass. Long-term observations shall be conducted to understand the response of phytoplankton to ARs.

They vary in depth from a few meters to over 400 m and range geographically throughout the northern Gulf of Mexico.Despite the number and ubiquitous placement of these structures, little information existed on associated fisheries resources due to difficulties in sampling petroleum platforms with traditional fisheries methods. Hydroacoustics enabled researchers to accurately assess the fisheries resources associated with these structures. From 1994 to 1996 dual-beam hydroacoustics were employed on quarterly research trips to measure the density and in situ target strengths of fishes associated with petroleum platforms in 20, 60 and 219 m of water. Species identification was provided by visual point counts using a remotely operated underwater vehicle. Density varied significantly with platform, distance from the platform, depth, platform side and time of the year. Platforms on the continental shell had a near field area of influence of approximately 18 m, while near field area of influence for the site on the continental slope was 10 m but the relationship was not as well defined as other sites. Average estimated abundance and 95% confidence intervals over the study period were 26 347 (+/-3636) at the 60 m site, 13 444 (+/-4578) at the 20 m site and 11 224 (+/-2618) at the 219 m site. Fishes were distributed throughout the water column at the sites on the continental shelf while at the 219 m site over 88% of the fishes were found in the upper 60 m.Visual point count surveys detected 10 species, 18 species and 14 species at the 20, 60 and 219 Lu sites, respectively. Despite the large number of fishes found at each site, 6-7 species constituted over 95% of all the fishes observed at each site and species composition was dominated by a single species at each site. The dominant species changed with site, and the most common species observed at each site included: Atlantic spadefish (Chaetodipterus faber) at the 20 m site, blue runner (Caranx crysos) at the 60 m site, and creole fish (Paranthias furcifer) at the 219 m site.

J,,,,,,,,,"Layman, Craig",,Fish aggregations and biogeochemical hot spots across regional environmental gradients,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Awarded Grant,Mar 01 2013,2013,"Consumers in marine ecosystems have long been acknowledged for their role in top-down regulation of ecosystems, but their influence through bottom-up pathways such as nutrient supply is often underappreciated and has not been integrated into models of coastal ecosystem dynamics. Yet, nutrient supply from consumers may be a regulating factor when consumers aggregate, such as fishes around structurally complex habitat. Examining this bottom-up mechanistic pathway is essential for a more holistic understanding of seagrass ecosystems, which are important and threatened globally. This study will address the following questions: (1) Does concentrated nutrient supply from consumers result in distinct biogeochemical hot spots in seagrass beds? and (2) How do consumer effects on ecosystem processes vary across regional environmental contexts where nutrient availability and fishing pressure vary? The PIs will conduct experiments at multiple sites within three biogeographic regions in the Caribbean (The Bahamas, Hispaniola, and Grenada/St.Vincent/Grenadines). The experiments will utilize artificial reefs that mimic natural patch reef habitats that concentrate animals at high densities. Response variables reflecting ecosystem processes (e.g., seagrass nutrient content, seagrass biomass, primary producer diversity) will be measured at reef sites and compared with control sites (seagrass sites without reefs). The spatial extent over which ecosystem processes may be affected, i.e., distance from artificial reef, will be quantified and used to detect ecological thresholds in ecosystem responses. Predictor variables, including measures of ambient nutrient availability, fish densities and fish grazing rates, will be used to contextualize the relative importance of consumer-mediated nutrient supply. The hierarchical experimental design and two-pronged analysis will characterize relationships across environmental gradients found among and within the biogeographic regions, facilitating a conceptual framework needed to predict when, where, and why consumer-mediated nutrient supply is an important control of ecosystems processes in seagrass beds. Broader Impacts: The project is designed to maximize broader impacts at regional, national, and local levels through extensive integration of research and education efforts. The entire program is designed in partnership with The Nature Conservancy, for which the PI serves on the Caribbean Advisory Board. The Nature Conservancy is at the forefront of the Caribbean Challenge, an effort to protect 20% of marine habitats by the year 2020. All of the planned study sites are part of current, or proposed, marine protected areas as part of the Caribbean Challenge initiative. Data from the research will inform monitoring plans, management strategies, and prioritization of conservation measures. Outreach initiatives at local and national levels will be designed with sensitivity to local environmental and social opportunities and challenges. For example, in The Bahamas, the PI will help design and develop a new center on Abaco Island intended to support research, education and conservation activities: ACRE (the Abaco Conservation, Research & Education Center). The outreach website The Abaco Scientist will be expanded, continuing to provide a platform for quick dissemination of information to the general public. Emphasis will be placed on training minority students under-represented in the sciences, providing experiences within an integrated science, education, and cross-cultural integration model.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,1259306,,,,,,,,Florida International University,,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:13976624,,

Recently confirmed discovery of many offshore oil and gas deposits in Malaysian waters has ignited new confidence in this sector. However, this has also spurred intense interest on safeguarding the health and environment of coastal waters in Malaysia from adverse impact resulting from offshore oil and gas production operation. Offshore discharge of spent drilling mud and rock cuttings is the least expensive and simplest option to dispose of large volumes of drilling wastes. But this onsite offshore disposal may have adverse environmental impacts on the water column and the seabed. It may also pose occupational health hazards to the workers living in the offshore platforms. It is therefore important to model the transport and deposition of drilling mud and rock cuttings in the sea to enable proper assessment of their adverse impacts on the environment and the workers. Further, accumulation of drill particles on the seabed may impede proper operation of pipelines on the seabed. In this paper, we present an in-house application model TUNA-PT developed to cater to local oil and gas industry needs to simulate the dispersion and mount formation of drill cuttings by offshore oil and gas exploration and production platforms. Using available data on Malaysian coastal waters, simulation analyses project a pile formation on the seabed with a maximum height of about 1 m and pile radius of around 30 to 50 m. Simulated pile heights are not sensitive to the heights of release of the cuttings as the sensitivity has been mitigated by the depth of water.",,,,,21st National Symposium on Mathematical Sciences (SKSM)21st National Symposium on Mathematical Sciences (SKSM),"NOV 06-08, 2013NOV 06-08, 2013",Malaysian Math Sci SocMalaysian Math Sci Soc,"Univ Sains Malaysia, Sch Math Sci, MALAYSIAUniv Sains Malaysia, Sch Math Sci, MALAYSIA",1,0,0,0,0,0,1,,,0094-243X,,978-0-7354-1241-5,,,,,,,,,"Univ Sains Malaysia, Sch Math Sci, George Town 11800, MalaysiaUCSI Univ, Ctr Excellence Res Value Innovat & Entrepreneursh, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia",,,,2014-10-08,WOS:000341564600073,,

There is also recognition of the need for marine spatial planning (MSP) as a process for informing EBM with regard to the allocation and siting of ocean uses so that ecosystem health is ensured and trade-offs between ecosystem services are appropriately dealt with. Marine spatial planning is both an integrated and an area-based process, and this paper produces a spatial characterisation of the BCLME for achieving a common basis for MSP in the region, focusing on the oceanography, biology and fisheries. Recognising spatial variation in physical driving forces, primary and secondary production, trophic structures and species richness, four different subsystems are characterised: (1) north of the Angola-Benguela Front, (2) from the Angola-Benguela Front to Luderitz, (3) from Luderitz to Cape Agulhas, and (4) from Cape Agulhas to Port Alfred on the south-east coast of South Africa. Research and monitoring requirements of relevance for MSP and EBM in the region are identified, focusing on understanding variability and change, including with regard to the boundary areas identified for the system. To this end, 14 cross-shelf monitoring transects are proposed (including seven that are already being monitored) to estimate fluxes of biota, energy and materials within and between the subsystems. The usefulness of models for understanding ecosystem variability and changes is recognised and the need for fine-scale resolution of both sampling and modelling for adequate MSP as input to EBM for the often-conflicting interests of conserving biodiversity, and managing fisheries, recreation, offshore oil and gas exploration and exploitation, offshore mining and shipping routes, is emphasised.",,,,,,,,,32,0,0,0,24,0,32,,,1814-232X,1814-2338,,,,,,,,,,"Dept Environm Affairs, Branch Oceans & Coasts, Cape Town, South AfricaUniv Cape Town, Dept Biol Sci, Anim Demog Unit, ZA-7925 Cape Town, South AfricaUniv Cape Town, Marine Res Inst, ZA-7925 Cape Town, South AfricaUniv Cape Town, Dept Oceanog, ZA-7925 Cape Town, South AfricaFAO, I-00100 Rome, ItalyUniv Cape Town, Dept Biol Sci, ZA-7925 Cape Town, South AfricaIRD, UMR MARBEC 248, Sete, FranceRhodes Univ, Dept Ichthyol & Fisheries Sci, ZA-6140 Grahamstown, South AfricaUniv Namibia, Dept Fisheries & Aquat Sci, Pioneerspk, NamibiaDept Agr Forestry & Fisheries, Branch Fisheries Management, Cape Town, South Africa",Dept Agr Forestry & Fisheries,,,2016-05-25,WOS:000375323000002,,

This area of the outer continental shelf (OCS) is the historical and present location of >90% of all US OCS oil and gas production and reserves. The juxtaposition of its 4000 producing platforms, recovering $10 billion yr(-1) of oil, gas and produced water in the same area where about 28% of the US fisheries catch (by weight) is made and near 40% of the US coastal wetlands, makes this an area worth monitoring for regional pollutant loading. This loading may come from several sources, including sources related to OCS development, but also from the Mississippi River watershed. In this context, any contaminant loading on this shelf may be neither detectable nor significant against a background of climatic or biological variability.We examined the sedimentary record for indicators of industrial by products from OCS oil and gas development and of industrial products entering via the Mississippi River, primarily using vanadium (V) and barium (Ba) concentrations normalized for aluminum (M). Barium is primarily used in drilling muds in the form of barite, whereas V is an important strengthening component of metal alloys, including steel. The fluctuations in the accumulation of Ba, but not V, were coincidental with the presumed use of barite. The fluctuations in V concentration in the sediments were coincidental with the national consumption of V. Copper (Cu), cadmium (Cd) and zinc (Zn) concentrations in sediments fluctuate coincidentally with V, not Ba, thus indicating that the dominant source of these trace metals in offshore sediments were derived from riverine sources, and were not primarily from in situ industrial processes releasing them on the shelf. This is not to suggest that local site-specific contamination is not a significant management or health concern.The low oxygen (hypoxia; less than or equal to2 mg l(-1)) zone that consistently covers much of this continental shelf's bottom layer in summer is attributed to nitrate loading from the Mississippi River. Increased nitrogen loading from river to shelf stimulates diatom production whose loading to the bottom layer and subsequent metabolism results in oxygen being depleted faster than it is replaced. In the last two decades there has been an increased accumulation of organic matter in sediments near the mouth of the Mississippi River. This coupling between river water, surface water and bottom water has recently expanded westward of the Atchafalaya River delta towards the Texas coast. The accumulation of biogenic silica (BSi) and carbon in dated sediments is coincidental with variations in riverine nitrate flux, but not with either V or Ba accumulation rates.These analyses indicate that both OCS development and riverine sources exert strong influences on the sediment constituents offshore, and that these influences may be independent of one another.

Settlement panels made from each of the materials were submerged in a vertical orientation during four seasonal exposure periods. There were clear seasonal trends across the four exposure periods with higher epifaunal biodiversity on all types of panel in the spring and summer exposure periods. Epifaunal assemblage structure was significantly different between the five types of material after each three-month exposure period. Concrete, preservative treated wood and PVC tended to have the highest species diversities. A successional study was also carried out. Over a 12-month exposure period epifaunal biodiversity increased on all five materials. After 12 months of exposure, the epifaunal assemblage structure was still significantly different between materials but had become more similar indicating a successional change towards a stable assemblage on all panels. The results indicate that material type and season have a significant effect on epifaunal assemblage structure after short ( three-month) periods of submersion but that these effects are reduced with increasing length of exposure.

Multi-habitat restoration has been used to a limited extent for marine habitats including oysters, mangroves and seagrass. Recent increases in research and understanding of shellfish-reefs and boulder/ cobble-reefs means they should likewise be considered for integrated restoration. Importantly, boulders have recently been used as the foundation for several large-scale oyster-reef restorations. These would benefit from improved recognition that multiple distinct habitat-types are involved each associated with distinct knowledge pools. These habitat-types mostly have similar restoration objectives, they often co-occur pre-disturbance, and they share varied taxa. These linkages mean that opportunities may be missed if restorations are only considered separately in contexts where an integrated approach is feasible; restoration of one habitat may benefit from concurrent restoration of the other and the sum of benefits from integration may outweigh the sum from restorations done separately. Here, I discuss concepts concerning five potential synergies: 1) boulders provide natural hard-substrata that initiates shellfish recruitment, 2) boulders produce beneficial hydrological heterogeneity, increasing recruitment of some shellfish species, 3) shellfish generate self-sustaining supplies of novel hard-substrata habitat used by boulder/cobble species thus expanding the original restoration site footprint, 4) large shellfish populations strengthen valuable ecological functions in boulder habitats, and 5) boulders and shells together increase overall diversity of available hard-substrata types, and thus of associated specialist species. Not only restoration outcomes, but also objectives and planning can be improved by integrating knowledge from both habitat-types to encompass these five synergies.",,,,,,,,,7,0,0,0,4,0,7,,,0925-8574,1872-6992,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Tartu, Estonian Marine Inst, Maealuse 14, EE-12618 Tallinn, Estonia",,,,2020-01-21,WOS:000505931400001,,

In addition to the direct loss of the exploited species, the very act of fishing, particularly with mobile bottom gear, destroys habitat and ultimately results in the loss of biodiversity. Furthermore, overfishing can create trophic cascades in marine communities that cause similar declines in species richness. These effects are compounded by indirect effects on habitat that occur through removal of ecological or ecosystem engineers. Mass removal of species that restructure the architecture of habitat and thus increase its complexity or influence the biogeochemistry of sediments could have devastating effects on local biodiversity and important water-sediment processes. The possible overexploitation of engineering species requires more attention because the consequences extend beyond their own decline to affect the rest of the ecosystem. This is particularly problematic in the deep ocean, where oil and gas exploration and fishing pressure are likely to increase.",,,,,,,,,301,4,0,0,233,4,355,,,0169-5347,1872-8383,,,,,,,,,,"Florida State Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Tallahassee, FL 32306 USAUniv Calif Davis, Bodega Marine Lab, Bodega Bay, CA 94923 USA",,,,2002-01-01,WOS:000172845200013,,

These reefs form a major three-dimensional habitat in deeper waters where little other 'cover' for fish is available. They are common in the eastern North Atlantic, and occur at least in the western North Atlantic and off central Africa. There are also other non-reef records of Lophelia in the Atlantic, and in Indian and Pacific oceans. Thus, not only are these reefs a significant habitat on a local scale, but they may also provide an important habitat over a very wide geographic scale.The present study examined the association of fish species with Lophelia in the Northeast Atlantic, including the Trondheimsfjord and Sula Ridge in Norway, Kosterfjord in Sweden, Darwin Mounds west of Scotland, and Rockall Bank, Rockall Trough and Porcupine Seabight off Ireland. The fish fauna associated with a shipwreck west of Shetland was also studied. Data were collected from 11 study sites at 8 locations, using 52 hours of video and 15 reels of still photographs. Video and still photographs were collected from (1) manned submersible, (2) surface controlled remotely operated vehicle (ROV), (3) a towed hopper camera, (4) wide angle survey photography (WASP), (5) seabed high resolution imaging platform (SHRIMP), and (6) an in situ time-lapse camera Bathysnap. It was possible to identify 90% of fish observed to species level and 6.5% to genus or family level. Only 3.5% of the fish were not identifiable. A guide to the fishes is given at http:// www.ecoserve.ie/projects/aces/. Twenty-five species of fishes from 17 families were recorded over all the sites, of which 17 were of commercial importance and comprised 82% of fish individuals observed. These commercial fish species contribute 90% of commercial fish tonnage in the North Atlantic.The habitats sampled were comprised of 19% reef, 20% transitional zone (i.e. between living coral and debris zone), 25% coral debris and 36% off-reef seabed. Depth was the most significant parameter in influencing the fish associated with the reefs, both at the species and family level. There was a complete separation of sites above and below 400-600 m depth by multi-dimensional scaling (MDS) analysis. Less distinct assemblages of fish species were associated with each habitat. Fish species richness and abundance was greater on the reef than surrounding seabed. In fact, 92% of species, and 80% of individual fish were associated with the reef.

One of the most recent types is oyster gardening. Oysters grown in floating structures are subsequently planted in bays, where they continue to live, grow, and spawn; filter the water; contribute to the larval pool; and provide habitat. Our study is one of the first evaluations of habitat value provided by floating oyster gardens in a degraded mid-Atlantic estuary. Oyster growth and survival within the floats was monitored in a eutrophic, turbid, periodically hypoxic, soft-bottom coastal lagoon system. We examined the abundance and diversity of fishes and invertebrates with respect to 3 replicated treatments: live oyster clusters, disarticulated oyster shell, and a float with no shells or oysters. We also studied the effects of 2 cleaning frequencies (biweekly and monthly) on species assemblages, and the growth and survival of oysters, and monitored basic water quality parameters. The species assemblages in floats with oyster clusters were very similar to those with loose shell but considerably different than that of empty floats. Cleaning frequency (biweekly and monthly) did not affect the growth or survival of oysters. Location of floats within the canal system, however, was a large determinant of oyster vital rates as well as community structure. Forty-nine species of fishes and invertebrates, and 8 species of macroalgae were collected from floating oyster gardens, including 9 commercial or recreational fishery species, many of which are likely habitat limited in the Inland Bays because of the loss of tidal wetlands, oyster reefs, and seagrass beds. Newly settled juvenile oysters have been found for the first time within the floating oyster gear in the manmade, residential canal systems.

Thus, intertidal and shallow marine habitats are largely being replaced by a variety of artificial substrata (e. g. breakwaters, seawalls, jetties). Understanding the ecological functioning of these artificial habitats is key to planning their design and management, in order to minimise their impacts and to improve their potential to contribute to marine biodiversity and ecosystem functioning. Nonetheless, little effort has been made to assess the role of human disturbances in shaping the structure of assemblages on marine artificial infrastructures. We tested the hypothesis that some negative impacts associated with the expansion of opportunistic and invasive species on urban infrastructures can be related to the severe human disturbances that are typical of these environments, such as those from maintenance and renovation works.Methodology/Principal Findings: Maintenance caused a marked decrease in the cover of dominant space occupiers, such as mussels and oysters, and a significant enhancement of opportunistic and invasive forms, such as biofilm and macroalgae. These effects were particularly pronounced on sheltered substrata compared to exposed substrata. Experimental application of the disturbance in winter reduced the magnitude of the impacts compared to application in spring or summer. We use these results to identify possible management strategies to inform the improvement of the ecological value of artificial marine infrastructures.Conclusions/Significance: We demonstrate that some of the impacts of globally expanding marine urban infrastructures, such as those related to the spread of opportunistic, and invasive species could be mitigated through ecologically-driven planning and management of long-term maintenance of these structures. Impact mitigation is a possible outcome of policies that consider the ecological features of built infrastructures and the fundamental value of controlling biodiversity in marine urban systems.",,,,,,,,,146,0,0,0,122,0,155,,,1932-6203,,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Bologna, Dipartimento Biol Evoluzionist Sperimentale, Ravenna, ItalyUniv Bologna, Ctr Interdipartimentale Ric Sci Ambientali Ravenn, Ravenna, ItalyWesleyan Univ, Dept Earth & Environm Sci, Middletown, CT USAUniv Pisa, Dipartimento Biol, CoNISMa, Pisa, ItalyUniv Sassari, Dipartimento Sci Bot Ecol & Geol, I-07100 Sassari, Italy",,,,2011-08-03,WOS:000293558900050,21826224,

Copepods were the main prey item for all juvenile fish species, irrespective of fish size. Ivlev's Index indicated that food was not a limiting factor for juvenile fish at farms. Furthermore, food pellets from the farm affected the food chain by modifying the fatty acid profiles of farm-associated zooplankton and juveniles of L. aurata and O. melanura. These results show that aquaculture can directly influence the body composition of juvenile fish that recruit to sea-cage fish farms. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

In the Mediterranean Sea, sessile benthic species, and particularly octocorals, have been affected by mass mortality events linked with positive thermal anomalies. The future survival of octocoral populations impacted by global change will depend on their recolonization abilities facing local extirpation or important modification of their habitat. We studied these processes in Mediterranean octocorals in two situations: the colonization of artificial substrates (wrecks) by the red gorgonian Paramuricea clavata, and the recolonization following mortality events in the yellow gorgonian Eunicella cavolini. With microsatellite markers (seven for P. clavata, five for E. cavolini), we analyzed the genetic diversity of populations on artificial substrates and their differentiation from other neighboring populations. For P. clavata the populations on artificial substrates were not or lowly differentiated from the closest populations (1.3-1.6 km) on natural substrates, and showed similar levels of genetic diversity. Artificial substrates can then be considered as an interesting substitute for natural substrates for this species. For E. cavolini we did not detect any variation in diversity or relatedness following recuperation after mortality events. In both cases, our results suggest the input from different populations in the recolonization process, which helps in maintaining the genetic diversity.

Three themes were investigated that differentiate the open ocean (areas beyond national jurisdiction and deep area within exclusive economic zones) from other realms and must be considered when developing planning and management options: ecosystem interactions, especially between benthic and pelagic systems; potential effects of human activities in open oceans on ecological linkages; and policy context and options. A number of key ecological factors differentiate open oceans from coastal systems for planners and managers: (1) many species are widely distributed and, especially for those at higher trophic levels, wide ranging; (2) the sizes and boundaries of biogeographical domains (patterns of co-occurrence of species, habitats and ecosystem processes) vary significantly by depth; (3) habitat types exhibit a wide range of stabilities, from ephemeral (e.g., surface frontal systems) to hyper-stable (e.g., deep sea); and (4) vertical and horizontal linkages are prevalent. Together, these ecological attributes point to interconnectedness between open ocean habitats across large spatial scales. Indeed, human activities - especially fishing, shipping, and potentially deep-sea mining and oil and gas extraction - have effects far beyond the parts of the ocean in which they operate. While managing open oceans in an integrated fashion will be challenging, the ecological characteristics of the system demand it. A promising avenue forward is to integrate aspects of marine spatial planning (MSP), systematic conservation planning (SCP), and adaptive management. These three approaches to planning and management need to be integrated to meet the unique needs of open ocean systems, with MSP providing the means to meet a diversity of stakeholder needs, SCP providing the structured process to determine and prioritise those needs and appropriate responses, and adaptive management providing rigorous monitoring and evaluation to determine whether actions or their modifications meet both ecological and defined stakeholder needs. The flexibility of MSP will be enhanced by the systematic approach of SCP, while the rigorous monitoring of adaptive management will enable continued improvement as new information becomes available and further experience is gained.

We hypothesized that variation in predation pressure is caused by the spatial patterns of coral colonies, i.e., a continuous or a patchy distribution. We conducted field experiments to determine whether (1) survival of juvenile varies between sites with different habitat characteristics, (2) predation pressure is density-dependent, and (3) small-sized juveniles are susceptible to predation. For experiments, juvenile Dascyllus aruanus were released into model coral colonies, covered or not covered with a cage, set at two contrasting sites (continuous habitat: continuous reef, patchy habitat: sandy bottom) on a coral reef in Okinawa. The density of predators was not significantly different between continuous habitat (continuous reef) and isolated habitat (sandy bottom), Just after the start of the experiment, a higher proportion of juveniles moved out from the model colonies at continuous reef, while a smaller proportion of them tended to stay in the colonies at sandy bottom. Fish survived significantly better in the uncaged treatment at continuous reef than at sandy bottom. The survival of large juveniles was greater than that of small juveniles, although it was not significantly different. Although predation pressure did not have a density-dependent effect on juvenile mortality, the trend toward density-dependent survival was stronger at sandy bottom than at continuous reef, suggesting that a density-dependent effect of predation might occur more frequently in isolated habitat.

A 35 wk period was selected, between April and November, for this survey, based on the seasonality of fishing for Delaware's primary reef fish tautog (Tautoga onita L.) and black sea bass (Centropristes striatus L.). A small, high wing position aircraft was used to conduct one weekday and one weekend day flight each week. Global Positioning System (GPS) technology was used to locate each reef and the number of vessels was counted visually. Flight start times (0900, 1300, and 1700 hrs) and direction (IN-S, S-N) were randomized. Local weather data, including rain and wind events were regressed against the instantaneous vessel count data to estimate annual angler and vessel trip effort for each reef site. The NOAA Marine Recreational Fishing Statistics Survey data (MRFSS) for Delaware were used to determine the mean number of anglers for each type of vessel. Trends in the data over the 1997-2004 period are presented. This survey effectively monitors trends in total fishing effort at Delaware's reef sites.

This chapter reviews the climate regulation services of estuarine and coastal ecosystems (ECEs) including tidal salt marshes, mangroves, seagrass beds, macroalgal forests, coral reefs, and coastal shelf ecosystems. ECEs regulate global and regional climates by sequestering or releasing carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases (GHGs). ECEs are extremely productive biologically, with net primary production rates per unit area among the highest of any ecosystem. Consequently, ECEs play a globally significant role as carbon sinks, with carbon storage rates per unit area of many habitats far exceeding that of land habitats at the rate of about 10 times that of temperate terrestrial forests and 50 times that of tropical forests. Furthermore, sedimentation does not reach an equilibrium carbon balance as occurs in terrestrial systems, whose sequestration capacity is forecasted to decrease this century. Conversely, they are large potential sources of GHG's if disturbed or misman-aged. Critically, carbon sequestration in many coastal habitats is superior to that of terrestrial habitats, as carbon is generally stored over long time frames (thousands of years) as a consequence of the large belowground biomass and the absence of fire threat. Furthermore, carbon is generally broken down anaerobically; hence, emissions of other potent GHGs such as methane and nitrous oxide are negligible. A review of literature provided sequestration rates for various coastal habitats. Using these in combination with global extent of selected habitats, this chapter finds that GHGs worldwide, mangroves, seagrass beds, and salt marshes combine to sequester a minimum of 136 000 tonnes C annually into long-term carbon storage. Assuming prices of CO2 epsilon from $10 to $90 per tonne, the value of the annual sequestration is $5-45 billion. This is an underestimate due to data gaps and, the limited assessment of the area of these three coastal ecosystem habitats, and relates only to long-term storage. The figures do not include short-term carbon storage in biomass, and further unaccounted for carbon sequestration occurs in kelp forests, estuaries, and coastal shelf seas. Many ECEs are under threat globally from sea-level rise, coastal development, pollution, and other anthropogenic stressors, and protection and restoration of ECEs may be an important tool for mitigating climate change. Currently, these habitats are not included in the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) carbon accounting frameworks, and therefore are excluded from incentive schemes such as carbon markets and other incentive programs, but their inclusion deserves consideration due to their potential for mitigating global climate change. The global distribution of C sequestration in ECEs reveals that large areas of the tropics are home to the highest sequestration rates and occur in developing countries, which also have the highest rates of coastal habitat degradation. Schemes such as Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD) may bring revenues and added benefits to developing countries for instigating projects and marine protected areas for conservation.Many small island nations and developing countries in the tropics are particularly vulnerable to climate change and contain large swathes of seagrasses and mangroves compared to overall land area, but do not contain large areas of forests or grasslands, which would apply to REDD in its current form. Coastal habitats thus not only present an untapped potential for inclusion in climate change mitigation schemes, but also present a little-recognized risk of loss of large carbon stocks if their degradation and destruction are not reduced or halted.",,,,,,,,,10,0,0,0,5,0,10,,,,,978-0-08-087885-0,,,,,,,,,"Portland State Univ, Portland, OR 97207 USACSIRO Marine & Atmospher Res, Brisbane, Qld, Australia",,,,2011-01-01,WOS:000333928000010,,

Artificial mangrove structure in the field attracted slightly more juvenile fish than areas without structure. Artificial structure left to accumulate fouling algae attracted four-times the total number of juvenile fish than areas without structure or areas with clean structure. Community composition of fish attracted to structure with fouling algae was different when compared with areas with no structure or clean structure; five species were attracted by structure with fouling algae whilst two species were associated with structure regardless of fouling algae. Algae were linked to increased food availability and it is suggested that this is an important selection criteria for some species. Other species were apparently attracted to structure for different reasons, and provision of shelter appears to be important. Predation pressure influenced habitat choice in small juvenile fish in laboratory experiments. In the absence of predators, small juveniles of four out of five species avoided shelter but when predators were introduced all species actively sought shelter. Large fish were apparently less vulnerable to predators and did not seek shelter when predators were added to their tank. Feeding rate was increased in the mangrove habitat for small and medium-sized fish compared with seagrass beds and mudflats indicating increased food availability or foraging efficiency within this habitat. Larger fish fed more effectively on the mudflats with an increased feeding rate in this habitat compared with adjacent habitats. The most important aspect of the mangrove habitat for small juvenile fish is the complex structure that provides maximum food availability and minimises the incidence of predation. As fish grow a shift in habitat from mangroves to mudflat is a response to changes in diet, foraging efficiency and vulnerability to predators. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

Increased mortality occurred at 4800 ppm Ba. For cadmium, LOEC and EC50 values for total population abundance were 2.95 and 8.82 ppm, respectively.

Telemetry tags (Sonotronics model Am) that transmitted tri-axial acceleration range, with average depth or average temperature were developed specifically to monitor red snapper and tested in captive fish. Wild red snapper were surgically implanted at depth and monitored for 16 months over artificial and natural reefs. Overall dynamic body acceleration (ODBA) as the sum of x, y and z acceleration range (0-0.398 g along each axis) was used to estimate activity levels of red snapper at each reef. Measurements of red snapper indicated that season, diel period, temperature time blocks and reef type had significant effects on ODBA and depth use. Red snapper were more active during the summer, at night, and during a period of rapid temperature increase. Red snapper were also generally more active and stayed at shallower depths on ships. The increases in activity reported here may be attributed to differing feeding or spawning behaviors on certain reefs. These results suggest that environmental factors such as temperature and diel period heavily influence red snapper and that they behave differently on specific habitat types at certain times.

However, the inventory does not consider the seabed geological conditions that will control the safe development of seabed installations and cable corridors. The Geological Survey of Canada (Natural Resources Canada) has therefore undertaken an assessment of seafloor geological characteristics and physical environmental parameters that will be encountered during any extensive deployment of marine renewable energy systems for the Pacific offshore of Canada. Here we present an overview of seabed characterization for key sites for each of the three energy types.Narrow passages exiting the Salish Sea near the Canadian boundary with the United States and northwards out of the Strait of Georgia provide very promising sites for tidal generation. Here, elliptical fields of very large subaqueous dunes, from 12 to 28 m in height, present a significant challenge to site development. Along the exposed continental shelf of Vancouver Island focused wave-energy close to shore (40-60 m water depth) offers significant energy potential, but any engineering systems would have to be founded on a seafloor made up of a mobile gravel lag and an extensive boulder pavement. A large wind farm proposed for the Pacific North Coast would be built on an extensive shallow bank that has active sediment transport and a large field of sand ridges that have developed within a macrotidal environment. A significant challenge is providing for a safe seafloor cable corridor of over 100 km that crosses a large subaqueous dune field to connect to the electrical grid on the mainland. These examples show how geoscience has and will provide critical information to project proponents and regulators for the safe development of marine renewable energy.

The landings have decreased markedly since 1970, in spite of various restrictions such as a shorter fishing season, an increase in the minimum legal size of landed crabs, and a reduction of the maximum landed catch per trip. The failure of the stock to recover has been complicated by the inability of the Danish seine fleet to avoid capture of undersized crabs during both the crab and the flounder fishing seasons. To reduce the fishing pressure, six preserved areas totaling 67.8 km(2), equivalent to about 4.4% of the total crab fishing grounds, were established off Kyoto Prefecture between 1983 and 2007. Artificial reefs made of concrete blocks were constructed in each of the six areas. Furthermore, to avoid bycatch of the crabs during the closed fishing season, fishing at depths of 220-350 m has been prohibited from September to October since 1979, and at depths of 230-350 m from April to May since 1994. An improved seine net, with a separator panel, has proven effective for retaining the target flounder species and yet allows most crabs to escape.

Upon transport to the Siberian shelf seas, this material may be degraded and released to the atmosphere, exported off-shelf, or buried in the sediments. While our understanding of the fate of permafrost-derived organic matter in shelf waters is improving, poor constraints remain regarding degradation in sediments. Here we use an extensive data set of organic carbon concentrations and isotopes (n=109) to inventory terrigenous organic carbon (terrOC) in surficial sediments of the Laptev and East Siberian Seas (LS + ESS). Of these similar to 2.7 Tg terrOC about 55% appear resistant to degradation on a millennial timescale. A first-order degradation rate constant of 1.5 kyr(-1) is derived by combining a previously established relationship between water depth and cross-shelf sediment-terrOC transport time with mineral-associated terrOC loadings. This yields a terrOC degradation flux of similar to 1.7Gg/year from surficial sediments during cross-shelf transport, which is orders of magnitude lower than earlier estimates for degradation fluxes of dissolved and particulate terrOC in the water column of the LS + ESS. The difference is mainly due to the low degradation rate constant of sedimentary terrOC, likely caused by a combination of factors: (i) the lower availability of oxygen in the sediments compared to fully oxygenated waters, (ii) the stabilizing role of terrOC-mineral associations, and (iii) the higher proportion of material that is intrinsically recalcitrant due to its chemical/molecular structure in sediments. Sequestration of permafrost-released terrOC in shelf sediments may thereby attenuate the otherwise expected permafrost carbon-climate feedback.Plain language summary Frozen soils in the Arctic contain large amounts of old organic matter. With ongoing climate change this previously freeze-locked carbon storage becomes vulnerable to transport and decay. Upon delivery to the shallow nearshore seas, it may either be directly degraded to carbon dioxide or methane and thereby fuel further warming or get buried and stored in sediments on the sea floor. Our understanding of the fate of carbon released from permafrost soils is increasing, yet uncertainties remain regarding its degradation in the sediment. Here we constrain how much land-derived organic carbon is deposited in the top layer of the sediment (the part that is prone to transport and exposed to oxygen-stimulated degradation) in the Laptev and East Siberian Seas. We find that more than half of this stock likely resists degradation, while the rest decays relatively slowly. Therefore, the amount of carbon released annually from degradation in surface sediments is much smaller than what was found to be emitted from overlying waters in earlier studies. We suspect that this difference is caused by a combination of mechanisms hindering degradation in sediments and thus conclude that the burial of land-derived carbon may help to dampen the climate impact of thawing permafrost.",,,,,,,,,28,4,0,0,8,0,32,,,0886-6236,1944-9224,,,,,,,,,,"Stockholm Univ, Dept Environm Sci & Analyt Chem, Stockholm, SwedenStockholm Univ, Bolin Ctr Climate Res, Stockholm, SwedenVrije Univ Amsterdam, Dept Earth Sci, Amsterdam, NetherlandsCNR, Inst Marine Sci, Bologna, ItalyUniv Alaska Fairbanks, Int Arctic Res Ctr, Fairbanks, AK USARussian Acad Sci, Pacific Oceanol Inst, Vladivostok, RussiaNatl Res Tomsk Polytech Univ, Tomsk, Russia",Stockholm Univ,,,2019-02-27,WOS:000458243500006,31007382,

The effect of dissolved oxygen (DO) concentration on the density and distribution of fishes at this de facto artificial reef was examined. The techniques used permitted surveys of the entire water column, providing a more accurate reflection of the effect of a highly variable phenomenon (i.e., hypoxia) that may not be measured with traditional fisheries sampling equipment. Hypoxic conditions were observed during two of the five trips to the petroleum platform, South Timbalier 54. When hypoxia was present, fish density was dramatically higher in the strata immediately above the hypoxia. It was difficult to determine the exact impact of hypoxia on target strength (a measure of fish size), as the larger mean target strengths observed in the spring and summer may be due to seasonal factors and not to hypoxia alone. With the exception of the fall 1995 survey (which had significantly higher density and abundance estimates than other surveys), the estimated number of fishes did not vary among any of the sample periods. Even when 32% (15-22 m) of the water column was hypoxic (summer 1996), abundance estimates were slightly higher than in other survey periods without hypoxia (except fall 1995). While hypoxia reduced the availability of the water column to fishes, they concentrated where favorable DO levels were found. This included demersal species such as red snapper Lutjanus campechanus, which were found higher in the water column than expected.",,,,,,,,,32,0,0,0,30,0,42,,,0275-5947,,,,,,,,,,,"Stantec Consulting Ltd, Brampton, ON L6T 5B7, CanadaLouisiana State Univ, Sch Coast & Environm, Dept Oceanog & Coastal Sci, Baton Rouge, LA 70803 USA",Stantec Consulting Ltd,,,2004-05-01,WOS:000222067500030,,

To achieve this aim, we present two assessments. First, we investigate the impacts of a North Sea power grid enabling enhanced trade and integration of offshore wind power. Second, we assess the benefit of the North Sea grid and wind power through a comparison of scenarios for power generation in affected countries.The grid scenario explored in the first assessment is the most ambitious scenario of the Windspeed project and is the result of cost minimization analysis using a transmission-expansion-planning model. We develop a hybrid life cycle inventory for array cables; high voltage, direct current (HVDC) links; and substations. The functional unit is 1 kWh of electricity transmitted. The second assessment compares two different energy scenarios of Windspeed for the North Sea and surrounding countries. Here, we utilize a life cycle inventory for offshore grid components together with an inventory for a catalog of power generation technologies from Ecoinvent and couple these inventories with grid configurations and electricity mixes determined by the optimization procedure in Windspeed.Developing, operating, and dismantling the grid cause emissions of 2.5 g CO2-Eq per kWh electricity transmission or 36 Mt CO2-Eq in total. HVDC cables are the major cause of environmental damage, causing, for example, half of total climate change effects. The next most important contributors are substations and array cabling used in offshore wind parks. Toxicity and eutrophication effects stem largely from leakages from disposed copper and iron mine tailings and overburden. Results from the comparison of two scenarios demonstrate a substantial environmental benefit from the North Sea grid extension and the associated wind power development compared with an alternative generation of electricity from fossil fuels. Offshore grid and wind power, however, entail an increased use of metals and, hence, a higher metal depletion indicator.We present the first life cycle assessment of a large offshore power grid, using the results of an energy planning model as input. HVDC links are the major cause of environmental damage. There are differences across impact categories with respect to which components or types of activities that are responsible for damage.

Along with its accompanying Open File Report (OFR), this comprehensive database can be used (and modified or updated) to quantify marine bird vulnerability to OWEIs in the CCS at the population level. For 81 marine bird species present in the CCS, we generated numeric scores to represent vulnerability of collision and displacement associated with potential OWEI. The metrics used to produce these scores includes global population size, proportion of the population in the CCS, threat status, adult survival, breeding and feeding score, annual occurrence in the CCS, nocturnal and diurnal flight activity, macro-avoidance behavior, flight height, and habitat flexibility can be updated and adjusted as new data become available. The scoring methodology was peer-reviewed to evaluate if the metrics identified and the values generated were appropriate for each species considered. The numeric vulnerability scores in this database can readily be applied to areas in the CCS with known species distributions and where offshore renewable energy development is being considered.

Simulations consist of discretizing and integrating the partial differential equations governing fluid flow and transport forward in time, providing solutions for physical variables (fields such as velocity and pressure) as function of time and space in the entire domain of interest. Since such simulations generate enormous amounts of data, the prevailing approach has been for researchers to analyze the data on the fly during the simulation runs while only a small subset of time-steps are stored for subsequent analysis. As a result, often large simulations of the same process must be repeated after new questions arise that were not initially obvious. Many (or even most) breakthrough concepts cannot be anticipated in advance, as they will be motivated in part by output data and must then be tested against it. As a result, there is a need for methods to store entire space-time data from such simulations. This project develops innovative tools for the efficient creation of open numerical databases that contain massive outputs from computational fluid dynamics simulations used in turbulence research and geophysical transport modeling and makes these available to the entire community. Several of the datasets to be included into the Open Numerical Laboratory will be contributed by external researchers. In addition to enhancing engineering and geophysical fluid mechanics and turbulence research, democratized access to large-scale turbulent flow simulation data will also play a crucial role in education and training for the next generation of researchers. Active learning through new educational modules that allow students to query simulation datasets in unprecedented detail will provide new educational paradigms. More broadly, the lessons learned from this project will be generalizable to many other fields where numerical simulations generate very large datasets that are difficult to access using prevailing approaches. In this way, the project will enhance the scientific and broader impacts of the US high-performance scientific computing infrastructure. This project will develop innovative tools for the efficient creation of open numerical databases that contain massive outputs from computational fluid dynamics simulations used in turbulence research and geophysical transport modeling. An ingest pipeline to be developed will enable users to transfer data from file systems containing the output of their massive direct numerical simulations, build a database, and serve it to the community for open exploratory data analysis and innovative turbulence and oceanic mixing research. To date, the investigators involved in this project have built an Open Numerical Laboratory focusing on direct numerical simulations (DNS) of canonical turbulent flows, in which the entire space-time data are available to the wider research community. However, the existing datasets are few in number and databases have been created one by one, using methodologies difficult to replicate on a massive scale. Moreover, emerging Exascale simulations will potentially result in data sets of unprecedented scale (tens to hundreds of PetaBytes). Advanced computer science algorithms will be required to tackle these challenges. This project will (a) develop automated, and scalable data management algorithms to ingest, index and serve very large data sets generated by a wide range of groups, (b) explore novel algorithms using spatio-temporal subsampling combined with online interpolation with re-simulation, yielding large compression factors depending on the subsampling stride, and (c) use machine learning algorithms to identify localized regions of interest in the simulations and save these 4D domains in a database for detailed follow-up analytics. The new databases will include data from (1) the largest channel flow DNS, (2) rotating and stratified turbulence of geophysical interest, (3) a DNS of developing wall boundary layer and (4) detailed ocean circulation models with complex boundary conditions. As part of the innovative domain science applications, data sets will be used to improve turbulence models using data-assimilation concepts, study Lagrangian vortex dynamics, and explore geophysical transport in a regional general circulation model of the North Atlantic Ocean.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,1633124,,,,,,,,Johns Hopkins University,,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:13881110,,

The mean benthic respiration rate measured with the lander was 0.057 mM O-2 m(-2) h(-1) (n = 5); whereas the mean measured with the BMICs was O.11 mM O-2 m(-2) h(-1) (n = 21; p < 0.01 that the means were the same), In terms of carbon fluxes (14 and 27 mg C m(-2) d(-1)), these respiration rates represent ca. 5-15% of the average net primary production measured in the euphotic zone in 1992. The biomass of the bacteria, meiofauna and macrofauna were measured at each location to quantify the relationship between total community respiration and total community biomass (mean 1.42 g C m(-2)). Average carbon residence time in the biota, calculated by dividing the biomass by the respiration, was on the order of 50-100 days, which is comparable to relatively oligotrophic continental margins at temperate latitudes.The biomass and respiration data for the aerobic heterotrophic bacteria, the infaunal invertebrates (meiofauna and macrofauna), and the epifaunal megabenthos (two species of brittle stars) are summarized in a 'steady-state' solution of a sediment food chain model, in terms of carbon. This carbon budget illustrates the relative importance of the sediment-dwelling invertebrates in the benthic subsystem, compared to the bacteria and the epibenthos, during the summer open-water period in mud-lined troughs at depths of about 300 m. The input needed to drive heterotrophic respiratory processes was within the range of the input of organic matter recorded in moored, time-sequencing sediment traps.A time-dependent numerical simulation of the model was run to investigate the potential responses of the three size groups of benthos to abrupt seasonal pulses of particulate organic matter. The model suggests that there is a time lag in the increase in bottom community biomass and respiration following the POC pulse, and provides hypothetical estimates for the potential carbon storage in the summer (open water), followed by catabolic losses during each ensuing winter (ice covered).

Strained by current low prices of crude oil, cost rationalization is essential for economic viability of oil and gas exploration offshore. Offshore exploration involves costly activities such as well drilling, well completion and testing as well as installation of flow lines and subsea facilities. Well drilling generates drill cuttings which may be disposed either onshore or offshore. Onshore disposal is not cost-effective and operationally complicated, and should be the option of last resort. More cost-effective offshore disposal of drill cuttings should therefore be utilized if it can be proven to be environmentally sustainable to the marine environment and ecosystems. This research was initiated to assess the environmental sustainability of offshore disposal of drill cuttings by means of model simulations. A critical concern in drill cuttings offshore disposal is the suspended solids (SS) created that might pose adverse impact to marine ecosystems. This paper presents the results of a simulation study by means of AQUASEA, developed by Vatnaskil Consulting Engineers, on the transport and fact of SS at an offshore oil and gas exploration platform in Siakap North Petai Field, off Sabah in the South China Sea. Simulated SS plumes subject to the dominant semi-diurnal tidal flows in the South China Sea and local eddies will be presented. Simulation results indicate that this offshore disposal of drill cuttings is environmentally sustainable at the current rates of well drilling. (C) 2017 The Authors.

Quantifying spatial and temporal variation in settlement is therefore important to fully understand population dynamics, inform fisheries management targets, and design effective spatial management strategies. Data on nearshore patterns of fish settlement are lacking for the northern California Current System (CCS), which is characterized by complex oceanographic currents and a seasonal, intermittent upwelling regime. Thus, to quantify spatial and temporal patterns of fish settlement in the northern CCS in relation to oceanographic conditions, we measured settlement of 5 fish taxa to 2 regions of the Oregon coast over 5 settlement seasons (late spring to early fall, 2012-2016). Temporal patterns of settlement reflected taxon-specific degrees of episodic settlement, with cabezon Scorpaenichthys marmoratus exhibiting the most uniform settlement across each season, and splitnose Sebastes diploproa and redbanded S. babcocki rockfishes exhibiting the most episodic settlement. Fish settlement tended to be greater during short periods of downwelling (upwelling relaxation events) for all but the largest fish taxa. Within settlement season, variation in size-at-settlement tracked taxon-specific temporal patterns of arrival but was unrelated to water temperature. Differences in fish settlement between small marine reserves and nearby unprotected areas was region- and taxon-specific, highlighting the fact that size and habitat heterogeneity should be considered in the design of marine reserves.

The 108 day-night samples collected alongside (vertical tows) and nearby (surface and oblique tows) platforms yielded 1526 larval and early juvenile fishes representing 55 taxa from 45 families. Epipelagic/mesopelagic taxa dominated the catches, whereas hard/soft habitat-associated taxa were uncommon. Carangidae (36.2%) and Myctophidae (31.5%) dominated in summer and winter, respectively. The most abundant taxon was Trachurus declivis (Carangidae, 35.1%), followed by Bovichtus angustifrons (Bovichtidae, 8.7%), Scomberesox saurus (Scomberesocidae. 3.7%), Centroberyx affinis (Berycidae, 3.0%) and Arripis trutta (Arripidae, 1.7%). Fish concentrations (nos. per 100 in 3) alongside platforms did not differ significantly between day and night across all surveys. Likewise, concentrations nearby platforms in February 1999, including those of T. declivis, did not vary significantly by tow type (surface vs. oblique) or day vs. night. The far greater diversity and abundance recorded in February 1999 are likely the result of upwelling conditions over the eastern Bass Strait shelf during the sampling period, and which were not detected in February 1998. In the absence of data on adult fishes associated with the Bass Strait platforms, and given the limited availability of reefs directly around the area, it could be argued that some of the taxa caught may originate from spawning around neighboring natural reefs, particularly those off the Gippsland coastline and the south-east corner of mainland Australia. However, the prime position of the platforms almost right in the center of a productivity hotspot would have a confounding effect on the potential source(s) of larval fishes in that region of south-eastern Australia. The role of platforms as potential de-facto reefs for juvenile fishes in Bass Strait, as well as spawning areas, is discussed based on the findings of this study, the first on early stages of fishes around oil and gas platforms in Australia.

We sampled 54 eelgrass (Zostera marina) meadows, spread across eight ocean margins and 36 degrees of latitude, to determine abiotic and biotic factors influencing organic carbon (C-org) stocks in Zostera marina sediments. The C-org stocks (integrated over 25-cm depth) showed a large variability and ranged from 318 to 26,523gC/m(2) with an average of 2,721gC/m(2). The projected C-org stocks obtained by extrapolating over the top 1m of sediment ranged between 23.1 and 351.7MgC/ha, which is in line with estimates for other seagrasses and other blue carbon ecosystems. Most of the variation in C-org stocks was explained by five environmental variables (sediment mud content, dry density and degree of sorting, and salinity and water depth), while plant attributes such as biomass and shoot density were less important to C-org stocks. Carbon isotopic signatures indicated that at most sites <50% of the sediment carbon is derived from seagrass, which is lower than reported previously for seagrass meadows. The high spatial carbon storage variability urges caution in extrapolating carbon storage capacity between geographical areas as well as within and between seagrass species.",,,,,,,,,107,2,0,0,73,0,119,,,0886-6236,1944-9224,,,,,,,,,,"Abo Akad Univ, Fac Sci & Engn Environm & Marine Biol, Turku, FinlandUniv Southern Denmark, Dept Biol, Odense M, DenmarkUniv Victoria, Dept Biol, Victoria, BC, CanadaStockholm Univ, Dept Ecol Environm & Plant Sci, Stockholm, SwedenSUNY Stony Brook, Sch Marine & Atmospher Sci, Southampton, NY USAUniv Quebec Chicoutimi, Dept Sci Fondament & Quebec Ocean, Saguenay, PQ, CanadaBulgarian Acad Sci, Inst Biodivers & Ecosyst Res, Sofia, BulgariaSmithsonian Inst, Tennenbaum Marine Observ Network, Edgewater, MD USAUniv North Carolina Chapel Hill, Inst Marine Sci, Morehead City, NC USASwansea Univ, Coll Sci, Singleton Pk, Swansea, W Glam, WalesUniv Autonoma Baja Calif, Fac Ciencias Marinas, Ensenada, Baja California, MexicoNatl Res Inst Fisheries & Environm Inland Sea, Fisheries Res & Educ Agcy, Hatsukaichi, JapanSan Diego State Univ, Dept Biol, San Diego, CA 92182 USASan Diego State Univ, Coastal & Marine Inst, San Diego, CA 92182 USANortheastern Univ, Dept Marine & Environm Sci, Nahant, MA USAGeomare, Ensenada, Baja California, MexicoSan Francisco State Univ, Estuary & Ocean Sci Ctr, Tiburon, CA USASan Francisco State Univ, Dept Biol, Tiburon, CA USAOregon State Univ, Dept Fisheries & Wildlife, Corvallis, OR 97331 USAUniv Gothenburg, Dept Marine Sci, Gothenburg, SwedenHokkaido Univ, Field Sci Ctr Northern Biosphere, Akkeshi Marine Stn, Sapporo, Hokkaido, JapanUniv British Columbia, Dept Zool, Vancouver, BC, CanadaUniv British Columbia, Biodivers Res Ctr, Vancouver, BC, CanadaNord Univ, Fac Biosci & Aquaculture, Bodo, NorwayUniv Calif Davis, Data Sci Initiat, Davis, CA 95616 USAUniv Montpellier, Ctr Marine Biodivers Exploitat & Conservat MARBEC, CNRS, Montpellier, FranceUniv Washington, Dept Biol, Seattle, WA 98195 USAUniv Algarve, ALGAE Marine Ecol Res Grp, CCMar Ctr Marine Sci, Faro, PortugalUniv Calif Davis, Dept Ecol & Evolut, Davis, CA 95616 USAUIB CSIC, IMEDEA, Esporles, SpainPusan Natl Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Pusan, South Korea",Geomare,,,2018-10-01,WOS:000450063500004,,

Twenty deep-water stations to the east and south of the Falkland Islands were sampled by commercial bottom trawl deployed in upper, middle and lower benthopelagic zones (depth range of approximately 500-1000 m). Forty-one species (22 families) of teleost fish were recorded, 10 species (two families) of elasmobranch and one species of agnathan. Different assemblages of fish were found to characterize each depth zone (e.g. Moridae in deeper waters, Bothidae and Rajidae in shallower waters), with diversity being greatest in the mid-zone and biomass greatest in the upper and lower zones. Some species occurred in ail zones but showed depth-related abundance. Four species, namely the grenadiers Macrourus carinatus and Coelorhynchus fasciatus, the southern blue whiting Micromesistius australis, and the Patagonian toothfish Dissostichus eleginoides, accounted for 85% by weight of all fish caught. Quantitative sampling of selected species revealed depth-related variations in their population structure. Length-frequency analyses are presented for M. carinatus and D. eleginoides and show a tendency for larger individuals to inhabit deeper water. Discard rates from the commercial catch were sometimes high, particularly for the smaller species, raising concerns about the impact of a fishery on by-catch species. The potential for deep-sea fisheries in Falkland waters is discussed and Further studies are suggested in the light of developing oil, gas and fishing industries.

The purpose of this document is to provide a summary of current DFO research results on the transport, fate and biological effects of operational drilling and production wastes on the eastern Canadian continental shelf. The Department of Fisheries and Oceans, assisted by funding from the Program for Energy Research and Development, has been conducting research on the transport, fate and effects of drilling wastes and the development of oil spill countermeasures since the late 1980's. During this time, international research has addressed continuing controversies regarding the impact of the offshore oil and gas industry. There is growing concern that produced water discharges may be causing contamination and effects on fish and fish habitat. The environmental data on production water are limited and few studies have been conducted on lethal and sub-lethal effects on marine organisms. The particulate fraction of discharged operational drilling wastes is also of concern because their drift, dispersion and dilution are generally lower than those of dissolved or buoyant discharges. The collection and interpretation of physical, chemical, geological, and biological oceanographic data have provided insight into the processes that influence drilling waste deposition on the seafloor and their subsequent redistribution. This research indicates that drilling waste discharges do not always disperse to negligible concentrations on the continental shelf, but can become concentrated in the near-seabed region (benthic boundary layer). Comprehensive three-dimensional models, developed to improve our capability for estimating the geographic 'zone of influence' of discharged drilling wastes, indicate that the exposure of organisms to potentially deleterious drilling waste concentrations can be expected to vary substantially between drilling sites. An important environmental concern related to the impact of offshore oil and gas developments is the consequence to resident organisms of long-term exposure to low-level contaminants. Only a very small fraction of marine organisms and life stages have been studied with respect to the potential for chronic lethal and sublethal effects at low waste levels. DFO studies on the chronic biological effects of production drilling wastes has focused on determining dose-response relationships in order to provide an estimate of the potential size of impact zones associated with spills or discharges from rig sites. Laboratory studies with flounder and sea scallops indicate little potential for drilling war waste toxicity beyond 1-2 km from a production drilling sites. A low level of MPO enzyme induction in American plaice taken near the Hibernia development site was observed. Prolonged or repeated induction of MFO especially to high levels, has the potential to produce a variety of physiological and pathological conditions in fish. Although observed impacts of drilling wastes have generally been attributed to chemical toxicity or organic enrichment effects of associated oil- and synthetic-base fluids, there is increasing field and laboratory evidence to indicate that fine particles in drilling wastes contribute greatly to the effects observed around drilling platforms. The studies with sea scallops indicate that physical interference by bentonite and barite particles in drilling wastes can significantly affect growth and reproduction at environmentally relevant concentrations. Modelling studies of the fate and effects of drilling wastes on scallops suggest there exists a small probability of detectable and significant population and ecosystem level effects of exploration drilling in some areas of the eastern Canadian shelf. The volume of produced water discharges will undoubtedly increase with the expansion of offshore oil and gas production operations in Atlantic Canada. While rapid dilution of the effluent stream is likely to reduce the concentrations to levels which are not acutely toxic to marine organisms, the possibility of chronic long-term effects cannot be excluded. Preliminary results have demonstrated a high level of spatial and temporal variability for contaminants within produced water samples recovered from the Atlantic Region. Furthermore, there is evidence that produced water contaminants may become concentrated within environmental compartments of known ecological importance (e.g. surface microlayer, benthic boundary layer). Important gaps in knowledge remain with respect to factors affecting dispersion of drilling discharges and chronic ecotoxicological effects of offshore oil and gas activities. An important step in addressing uncertainty is to have in place rigorous monitoring programs which take an ecosystem approach to provide early warning of any adverse environmental impacts. Environmental monitoring and protection plans should address site- and project-specific elements and the potential for impacts from other sources.

It would be expected that sites where fishes exhibited better growth, increased reproduction, or greater survival rates would be beneficial to regional fish populations. We determined and compared the birthdate distributions and daily growth rates of 116 young-of-the-year (YOY) blue rockfish (Sebastes mystinus Jordan and Gilbert, 1881) among two platforms and two natural reefs in the Santa Barbara Channel region. We found a significant though modest lunar pattern in birthdates where blue rockfish produced (or successfully recruited) more larvae in the week leading up to the full moon. Mean growth rates were significantly different across sites. At one of the two site pairs (platform-natural reef), YOY rockfish growth rates were significantly higher at the platform habitat; there was no statistical difference in growth rates between fish living at the other site pair.

J,,,,,,,,,Paul Shepley,,Minimising the adverse effects of water jetting,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Awarded Grant,Jan 16 2017,2017,"This proposal aims to facilitate the installation of piled foundations or other tubular structures through the application of water jetting. Water jetting involves firing high pressure water out of the base of a pile whilst simultaneously lowering or pushing the pile into the ground. Water jetting significantly reduces the installation loads, shortening the construction time and reducing any noise and vibration compared to conventional hammering of piles into the ground. These benefits have the potential to reduce the environmental disturbance of construction projects, especially where excessive noise is produced offshore (an increasing issue with new very large diameter monopiles causing disruption to marine animal life), as well as to reduce the total cost of construction (especially relevant to the offshore industry due to the large equipment costs). Proper application of water jetting may even allow very-large diameter offshore pile foundations to be installed to support larger wind turbines, increasing the amount of wind power available to the UK. As a result, a range of industries in the offshore construction sector (including oil and gas and renewable energy) wish to use water jetting in practice.Practitioners have concerns over the adverse effects of water jetting, hence the motivation for this research. These concerns arise from the large volumes of water required during construction and the effects water jetting may have on the final stability of the installation. The fluid used in water jetting has the potential to disrupt the surrounding soil structure, thus reducing its strength and stiffness. In the extreme this can contribute to catastrophic structural failures. Therefore, the research work proposed here is essential to allow water jetting to be more comprehensively understood, and its effects minimised and predicted prior to construction. This ought to increase its usage and allow the significant benefits of the jetting process to be realised.The first part of this project seeks to understand the soil response to water jetting, through small scale tests of transparent sand-like particles and a matched transparent fluid. These materials allow the fluid-particle interaction to be imaged in the centre of the model using a laser sheet and multiple cameras. From this, the jetting mechanism will be directly observed for the first time without disrupting the surrounding boundary conditions. This transparent modelling approach will allow the applicant to develop analytical relationships that govern the fluidisation and transportation of granular materials in high energy fluid flows in order to predict the performance of water jetting in the field.The second part of this project will see the modelling of several water jetted installations in sand. These will be similar to the installations in the transparent material but will be for larger depths in order to undertake axial and lateral load testing. The results will be compared with jacked installations without jetting to show the effects of water jetting on the final structural properties. This is essential if jetting is to be more widely used in the field.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,EP/P009182/1,,,,,,,,University of Sheffield,,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:15399857,,

Here we tested several strategies for gardening denuded reefs. The gardening concept consists of in situ or ex situ mariculture of coral recruits, followed by their transplantation into degraded reef sites. In situ nurseries were established in Eilat's (Northern Red Sea) shallow waters, sheltering three types of coral materials taken from the branching species Stylophora pistillata (small colonies, branch fragments, and spat) that were monitored for up to two years. Pruning more than 10% of donor colonies' branches increased mortality, and surviving colonies displayed reduced reproductive activity. Maricultured isolated branches, however, exceeded donor colony life span and reproductive activity and added 0.5-45% skeletal mass per year. Forty-four percent of the small colonies survived after 1.5-year mariculture, revealing average yearly growth of 75 +/- 32%. Three months ex situ maintenance of coral spat (sexual recruits) prior to the in situ nursery phase increased survivorship. Within the next 1.5 years, they developed into colonies of 3-4 cm diameter. Nursery periods of 2 years, 45 years, and more than >5 years have been estimated for small colonies, spat, and isolated branches, respectively. These and other results, including the possible use of nubbins (minute fragments the size of a single or few polyps), are discussed, revealing benefits and drawbacks for each material. In situ coral mariculture is an improved practice to the common but potentially harmful protocol of direct coral transplantation. It is suggested that reef gardening may be used as a key management tool in conservation and restoration of denuded reef areas. The gardening concept may be applicable for coral reefs worldwide through site-specific considerations and the use of different local coral species.",,,,,,,,,104,0,0,0,90,1,121,,,1061-2971,,,,,,,,,,,"Natl Inst Oceanog, Israel Oceanog & Limnol Res, Minerva Ctr Marine Invertebrate Immunol & Dev Biol, IL-31080 Haifa, IsraelUniv Amsterdam, IBED, NL-1090 GT Amsterdam, NetherlandsNetherlands Inst Sea Res, NL-1790 AB Den Burg, Netherlands",,,,2001-12-01,WOS:000172926500012,,

The mid-layer floating reef was concluded to act as a schooling ground for Trachurus japonica in the daytime.In May, many scattering fish echoes, which were thought to be a mixture of small squid, pelagic crustacea and others, were distributed over the whole survey area. They stayed around the reef twice-a scattering fish echo stayed at the bottom layer around the reefs for more than few hours, and a dense fish school stayed beneath the mid-layer reef for a short duration. These phenomena were concluded to show an attraction and detention function of the mid-layer floating reef.",,,,,,,,,2,0,0,0,1,0,2,,,0021-5392,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1992-07-01,WOS:A1992JX79700014,,

Monitoring post-translocation movements and migration provides useful information to inform translocation strategies. Three species of large-bodied fish (Yellowfin Bream Acanthopagrus australis, Luderick Girella tricuspidata, and Tarwhine Rhabdosargus sarba) impounded in a cooling water canal at a power station were translocated into the adjacent estuary (Lake Macquarie, New South Wales). Translocated fish were tagged with acoustic tags ( equipped with accelerometer sensors (providing a relative measure of fish activity) and released on either an artificial reef or a natural reef. In addition, 8 freeranging Yellowfin Bream were captured and tagged on the artificial reef. Fish were tracked throughout Lake Macquarie on a dispersed array of 18 VemcoVR2W receivers, and on the artificial reef using a VR4-UWM Vemco Positioning System, for up to 11 months. Yellowfin Bream and Luderick rapidly migrated back to the power station, whereas Tarwhine remained near the release location. Translocated Yellowfin Bream showed divergent behavioural patterns to free-ranging Yellowfin Bream on the artificial reef, with much higher activity levels, elevated nocturnal activity, and different patterns of habitat usage, possibly reflecting divergent foraging behaviour. This study presents a rare example of non-natal homing to an artificial habitat in several large-bodied marine fish species. The role of low frequency sound in the homing of translocated fish, and factors contributing to the observed behavioural patterns are discussed. The presence of a homing signal which can facilitate return migration may decrease the efficacy of translocation efforts for adult marine fishes; however, these responses are speciesspecific and will require evaluation on a case-by-case basis.",,,,,,,,,15,0,0,0,15,0,17,,,1054-3139,1095-9289,,,,,,,,,,"Port Stephens Fisheries Inst, NSW Dept Primary Ind, Locked Bag 1, Nelson Bay, NSW 2315, AustraliaUniv New South Wales, Sch Biol Earth & Environm Sci, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia",,,,2017-03-31,WOS:000397136400028,,

The study was conducted in two identical artificial reef mesocosms during seven weeks. Experimental tanks were maintained respectively at mean pHT 7.7 and 8.05 (with field-like night and day variations). The major physico-chemical parameters were identical, only pCO2 and pHT differed.

The images are derived from soundings from a hull-mounted multibeam sonar system. Two research vessels were involved in its collection. The Canadian Coast Guard vessel CCGS Amundsen conducted 3 successive research-oriented field surveys, from 2009 to 2011 using a Knudsen EM302 multibeam instrument. Between September 10th and October 10th, 2013, the Korean Oceanographic Polar Research Institute (KOPRI) research icebreaker Araon surveyed with an EM122 system. The Amundsen data represent an integration of the 3 successive field surveys, data collection was a part of collaboration between oil and gas industry partners (Imperial Oil Resources/British Petroleum), the GSC-A, and ArcticNet. Collaborators from the University of New Brunswick's Ocean Mapping Group have operated the Amundsen's compliment of geophysical equipment for the past several years, extending into the 2011 Expedition. The GSC-A conducted initial and post analysis of the acquired data. The KOPRI dataset stems from collaboration with the GSC-P. Vertical sound speed profiles were obtained from CTD casting stations and these velocities were applied to the acquisition system for correct depth calculations. Geologic features in the image include large and smaller submarine landslides with associated cliffs, faults, translational blocks, retrogressive failure, debrites and evacuation chutes. Sediment cover and areas devoid of cover together with cross-cutting relationships indicate a range in age and process. Other features include mud volcanoes indicating past and recent efflux of mud and fluids to the seabed on the upper slope, iceberg, sea-ice and floating glacier-driven seabed scour, influence by currents and/or past sea-level which limited and locally removed shelf-break glacial and post-glacial muds, incision of shelf-break canyons with differential sediment infill, seabed current-influenced distribution of recent muds derived ultimately from the Mackenzie River, influence on recent distribution of shelf-break muds by the Beaufort Jet, and finally structural disturbance of outermost shelf muds, probably related to degradation of permafrost and fluid migrations, forming mounds, collapses and associated basins.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2019-06-14,DRCI:DATA2019083015703284,,

The trajectories originated at Platform Irene, located west of Point Conception, California, during two recruiting.seasons for bocaccio (Sebastes paucispinis): May through August, 1999 and 2002. Given that pelagic juvenile bocaccio dwell near the surface, the trajectories estimate transport to habitat. We assumed that appropriate shallow water juvenile habitat exists inshore of the 50-m isobath. Results from 1999 indicated that 10% of the trajectories represent transport to habitat, whereas 76% represent transport across the offshore boundary. For 2002, 24% represent transport to habitat, and 69% represent transport across the offshore boundary. Remaining trajectories (14% and 7% for 1999 and 2002, respectively) exited the coverage area either northward or southward along isobaths. Deployments of actual drifters (with 1-m drogues) from a previous multiyear study provided measurements originating near Platform Irene from May through August. All but a few of the drifters moved offshore, as was also shown with the HF radar-derived trajectories. These results indicate that most juvenile bocaccio settling on the platform would otherwise have been transported offshore and perished in the absence of a platform.

Nearshore fish community structure results have been mainly derived from macro-scale habitat characteristics including depth and wave exposure but the influence of, and interaction with, micro-scale habitat substratum features is not well known. This study investigated the structure and functioning of the ichthyofauna composition on rocky substrata around the island of Arki in the Eastern Aegean Sea. Quantitative surveys of fish assemblage composition were carried out by Underwater Visual Census (UVC) at 14 sites assigned to three levels of exposure. The physical substratum of every transect area was described by 14 microhabitat characteristics. Multidimensional scaling (MDS) showed that exposure to wave activity was a significant factor in structuring fish assemblages differing in feeding guilds, species richness and diversity. Substratum heterogeneity, depth, boulder complexity and verticality were the main substratum descriptors that were related with wave exposure and hence were the determining factors defining fish community structure, as revealed by Canonical Correspondence Analysis (CCA). The similarity of percentages (SIMPER) determined the species that typified the different exposure groups. This study has shown that rocky littoral shores are of high ecological importance and their conservation is of great significance to maintain coastal fish diversity. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Additional impairment has occurred due to inappropriate technical constructions to protect built-up areas against floods caused by sea level rise. Delta subsidence due to upriver damming, on and offshore hydrocarbon extraction, beach sand mining, onshore ground water pumping, and soil compaction and loading because of coastal urbanisation has resulted in accelerated sea level rise, marine ingressions, and considerable land loss. Nutrient-rich runoffs, produced by intensified agriculture, effected the origination of - partially temporary - hypoxic coastal water bodies. Eutrophication and degradation of littoral waters also result from industrial aquafarming. Harbour mud dredged for navigational purposes has been contaminated with toxic metals. Oil and gas developments and havaries have caused severe hydrocarbon pollution in littoral areas several times. Toxic legacies exist in the form of waste-filled river and coastal impoundments, now exposed to sea level rise. Because of the mobilisation of toxic leachates and submarine discharge of contaminated plumes (e.g. in estuaries), redistribution of toxic metal species and their bioaccumulation occurs.

This conservation practice will help to increases the live coral covers, rebuild the destroyed coral reefs, and protect the reef biodiversity. The present study underwater experiments were revealed that profuse growths of transplanted corals are dependent on coral species and the study sites. There was significant differences in seasonal growth rate at northern side of Hare Island (p = .03), where the maximum mean Acropora coral growth rate around 11.75 cm was observed during summer from initial mean growth 7.65 cm.

Analyses of trace metals, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and organotins indicated significant but localised contamination of Astrolabe Reef but not of nearby Motiti Island. Three years after the grounding, PAH concentrations were greater in sediments at Astrolabe (up to 131 mg kg1) than at control locations, while organotins from the ship's antifouling hull paint were found exclusively in Astrolabe Reef sediments and biota. Over 80% of Astrolabe sediment samples contained tributyltin at concentrations above guideline sediment levels (0.07 mg kg1). Tributyltin and its decomposition products were also recorded in sea urchins, gastropods, lobster and fishes at concentrations up to 0.2 mg kg1. Wreck and cargo-derived metals, particularly copper, tin and zinc, were present in some Astrolabe sediment samples above Australia and New Zealand Environment and Conservation Council guideline concentrations. However, there appeared to be only limited transmission of metals through the food chain. Copper, tin and zinc were recorded at greater concentrations in Astrolabe sea urchins and gastropods compared to control specimens, while metal concentrations in other biota were comparable across impact and control sites. Despite over 3 years having passed since the Rena grounding, the data series does not show any upward or downward trends in contaminant concentrations on Astrolabe Reef. Consequently, there is uncertainty about the long-term implications of the Rena grounding for the ecology of Astrolabe Reef.

For this reason, new strategies are required to improve sustainability, reduce cost and enable wave energy harnessing even in low energy seas. Six new strategies that can make commercialization of wave energy more appealing are studied. These comprise the integration of wave energy converters (WECs) in coastal defence; tourism; desalination technology; offshore aquaculture; energy security; and power plants. WECs can axe erosion by half, or even more, in sandy beaches by creating wave shadows in their lee. Therefore, an innovative way to offset WEC high initial capital expenditure is their incorporation in coastal defence, with the added benefit of electricity production. Also, WECs can directly provide pressurized seawater for reverse osmosis desalination plants, thus achieving significant energy, cost and environmental footprint reductions. The touristic trade could also benefit from educational and interpretive displays of the wave energy technology, whilst ecotourism opportunities may arise that could address tourism seasonality. Combined offshore aquaculture facilities with WECs would benefit for reduced installation, operation, and maintenance costs, as well as addressing fossil fuel dependence in aquaculture. Moreover, WECs could be used for mitigating the intermittency of established renewables (solar and wind) and advance their penetration; while a combined WEC-pump hydropower storage scheme could secure the energy supply in remote coastal areas and islands. Finally, WECs could directly supply cooling water intake structures, such as power plants, with the huge amounts of seawater they require for cooling purposes. WEC are also able to provide high purity sterile water for core cooling in nuclear reactors and also support its circulation. For example, WECs can be introduced in coastal nuclear power plants, as to minimize the loss of coolant accident and prevent disasters similar to Fukushima's 2011.",,,,,,,,,34,2,0,0,4,1,38,,,1364-0321,1879-0690,,,,,,,,,,"Tech Univ Crete, Sch Environm Engn, Khania 73100, Greece",,,,2017-04-01,WOS:000396184900058,,

They efficiently sample from the surface to the seafloor or their depth limit collecting essential density variables for weeks to months at a time, providing invaluable information to validate ocean circulation models. However, they can collect much more data, and how those data sets evolve into potential uses is not always fully appreciated.Obviously, if a truck can hold more gear without significantly hurting gas mileage, why not throw more in the back end? As such, over the past decade other sensing equipment has been incorporated into glider payloads such as fluorometers, dissolved oxygen sensors, ADCPs, nutrient sensors, and more. This has allowed expanded use of the same platform without sacrificing their primary design mission of CTD profiles. These additional sensors have enabled new research in fields such as hypoxia dead zones, red tide evolution, and water column heat content. The combination of the various sensors on the same platform will continue to enhance our understanding of the connections between processes that drive our coastal oceans.An additional research area with potential use for gliders is fisheries management. Fish stock assessment depend upon data sets from fishery dependent or independent surveys that are used to set harvest limits. In the eastern Gulf of Mexico, many economically important species are benthic and generally tied to preferred habitat types. State, federal, and academic groups are coordinating efforts to generate habitat-specific population estimates, the first step of which is creating habitat maps to guide visual or trap surveys for the fish. This is typically done by initially creating detailed bathymetric maps of regions and assessing the bottom types through video and other methods to characterize the seafloor structure, habitat and the distribution of biota. However, visually mapping the entire West Florida Shelf is not feasible. Autonomous systems like gliders should be employed as a first-level reconnaissance tool to opportunistically discover reef features or fish hotspots.For the past several years, we've attempted to assess fish populations, site fidelity, migration, and other relevant characteristics by integrating passive acoustic recorders, tag telemetry receivers, and fisheries echosounders to a glider tasked with repeated transects within a test region. Our test region has been a large, well-known artificial reef, the Gulfstream Natural Gas Pipeline, a largely linear feature between Tampa Bay and Mobile Bay. Our sampling has been seasonal and focused on the eastern portion of this feature between the 30 and 50m isobaths on the West Florida Shelf (WFS) with a total of five deployments of a single glider completed. Vet, while the linear reef is a wonderful target for the glider, gliders cannot easily traverse a straight line when coastal tidal currents are involved. So, in typical meandering fashion, the glider would spend a lot of time in the region of the pipeline, but not directly over the pipe. We accepted these data as opportunistic and another form of reconnaissance that can inform the design of follow-on surveys.During our efforts, we have used glider-collected acoustic data to identify several hotspot locations with high fish densities for which we do not yet have habitat maps nor measures of fish abundance. We subsequently mapped one of these regions with high resolution multibeam echosounder to create detailed bathymetric imagery of the seafloor. This has resulted in discovering previously unknown regions of habitat including seafloor ridges and demersal fish excavated zones known as grouper holes. This technological approach, if applied in an observing system capacity of sustained and continuous operations over a region like the West Florida Shelf, will augment existing efforts to identify and describe fish habitat and help provide data sets complimentary to fish stock assessment.",,,,,Conference on OCEANS MTS/IEEE CharlestonConference on OCEANS MTS/IEEE Charleston,"OCT 22-25, 2018OCT 22-25, 2018",IEEE CharlestonIEEE Charleston,"Charleston, SCCharleston, SC",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,978-1-5386-4814-8,,,,,,,,,"Univ S Florida, Coll Marine Sci, Ctr Ocean Technol, St Petersburg, FL 33701 USALoggerhead Instruments, Sarasota, FL 34238 USAUniv S Florida, Coll Marine Sci, St Petersburg, FL 33701 USANOAA, Natl Ocean Serv, Beaufort, NC 28516 USA",Loggerhead Instruments,,,2019-04-05,WOS:000461320202092,,

In the northern Gulf of Mexico, oil and gas platforms provide the preponderance of both vertical relief and hard substrate habitat for red snapper and other reef-associated fishes. In July 1998, we collected morphometric data and sagittal otoliths from 300 red snapper randomly selected from among the mortalities manifested subsequent to the explosive removal of an obsolete gas platform. Ages estimated from counts of otolith annuli ranged from 1 to 9 years among these specimens. The virtual absence of age-1 red snapper (0.68%) and the preponderance of age-2 red snapper (53%) at the platform demonstrate that red snapper recruit to platforms sometime during their second year. Truncation of the age distribution results from natural mortality, fishing mortality and emigration to other habitats after several years of residency. Assuming this population to be typical, the age distributions of the commercial and recreational harvests suggest that oil and gas platforms serve as essential habitats for younger red snapper. Conversely, platforms may make red snapper at ages 4, 5, and 6 years more vulnerable to fishing mortality as they are perhaps being harvested in proportions greater than their numbers in the population at large.",,,,,Gulf of Mexico Fish and Fisheries MeetingGulf of Mexico Fish and Fisheries Meeting,"OCT 24-26, 2000OCT 24-26, 2000",Minerals Management ServMinerals Management Serv,"NEW ORLEANS, LANEW ORLEANS, LA",18,0,0,0,17,0,29,,,0892-2284,,1-888569-54-9,,,,,,,,,"Louisiana State Univ, Coastal Fisheries Inst, Sch Coast & Environm, Baton Rouge, LA 70803 USA",,,,2003-01-01,WOS:000185466300004,,

However, drifting thalli of Sargassum can reproduce and introduce embryos even on barren grounds. In order to investigate whether drifting Sargassum can effectively supply embryos, the abundance and fecundity were investigated in thalli entangled around floating ropes of a set net in western Wakasa Bay, in the Sea of Japan. Biomass of the entangled drifting Sargassum was the highest in late May. Drifting thalli of Sargassum patens and S. macrocarpum were found to release comparable numbers of embryos to those growing in seaweed beds. The following year, an artificial reef was deployed in the same area, and floating ropes were installed above the artificial reef to entrap drifting Sargassum. Six month later, the percent cover of Sargassum on the top of the artificial reef was higher around the floating ropes, suggesting that this setup facilitated the effective supply of Sargassum embryos. In addition. novel techniques to culture Sargassum seedlings were developed. The seedlings can be cultured freely in a transparent aquarium with strong bubbling. It is easy to adjust the density of seedlings in accordance with their size. avoiding density-dependent mortality and growth suppression. We also developed two techniques to fix seedlings to some setups or to the seabed.

In the oceans, generate impacts on benthic and pelagic marine communities, and consequently on the marine landscapes. In the mid-1980s, the coral species Tubastraea coccinea and Tubastraea tagusensis were accidentally introduced to the Brazilian coast, probably embedded in oil and gas platforms. Currently, such species are registered in most Brazilian coastal zones, including several protected areas. Commonly known as sun-corals, these species have several characteristics that give them high dispersal potential and, thus, have been systematically recorded, altering the marine landscape and affecting the functioning of invaded ecosystems. In Buzios Island, north coast of the State of São Paulo - where these species settled in high densities covering in some points almost 100% of the consolidated substrate - numerous changes in the benthic infralittoral community were measured. In addition, significant changes were observed in the unconsolidated substrate adjacent to the high concentration of these invaders. Adult colonies of Tubastraea are naturally coming off the vertical substrate and settling on adjacent sandy sediments, becoming a substrate for other species in a process known as invasion meltdown. As a result, several changes in the sandy landscape have been occurring and are likely to have significant consequences for the benthic communities of these unconsolidated bottoms as well as for the pelagic organisms that use them. Thus, through periodic sampling and manipulative in situ experiments, this interdisciplinary project aims to evaluate changes in benthic macrofauna communities resulting from the deposition of Tubastraea colonies in unconsolidated sediments.

However, findings from isolated habitats cannot necessarily be applied to fish communities in other habitats (e.g., a continuous habitat). In this study, therefore, we examined the structures of fish communities (abundance, species richness and species composition), and the dynamics of fish communities (seasonal changes in abundance, species richness and species composition) over a 2-year period in two different habitats (continuous habitat and isolated habitat) in an Okinawan coral reef. We established eight permanent quadrats (8 m x 8 m) on a rocky reef flat (continuous habitat) and rock reef patches surrounded by a sandy sea bottom (isolated habitat). The abundance and species richness of fishes such as pomacentrids, labrids, chaetodontids and acanthurids were greater in quadrats located in the continuous habitat, whereas those of blenniids, gobiids and mullids were greater in quadrats located in the isolated habitat. This caused marked differences between the fish community structure at the two sites. Seasonal and annual changes in fish community structure were relatively small at the continuous habitat site (>0.7 similarity based on Cpi index) but were large at the isolated habitat site (Cpi < 0.4), indicating that the fish community structure was relatively stable at the continuous habitat site but unstable at the isolated habitat site throughout the study period. Spatial differences between the fish community structures in the four quadrats at the continuous habitat site were small (Cπ > 0.65 in most sites), but these differences were large at the isolated habitat site (Cpi < 0.4). Our findings suggest that habitat structure (spatial arrangement of habitats) affects both spatial and seasonal differences in the reef fish community structure.

Whereas lava streams and deep ash deposits are well-known to devastate coral communities through burial and smothering, little is known about the effect of moderate amounts of small particulate ash deposits on reef communities. Volcanic ash contains a diversity of chemical compounds that can induce nutrient enrichments triggering changes in benthic composition. Two independently collected data sets on the marine benthos of the pristine and remote reefs around Pagan Island, Northern Mariana Islands, reveal a sudden critical transition to cyanobacteria-dominated communities in 2009-2010, which coincides with a period of continuous volcanic ash eruptions. Concurrently, localized outbreaks of the coral-killing cyanobacteriosponge Terpios hoshinota displayed a remarkable symbiosis with filamentous cyanobacteria, which supported the rapid overgrowth of massive coral colonies and allowed the sponge to colonize substrate types from which it has not been documented before. The chemical composition of tephra from Pagan indicates that the outbreak of nuisance species on its reefs might represent an early succession stage of iron enrichment (a.k.a. black reefs'') similar to that caused by anthropogenic debris like ship wrecks or natural events like particulate deposition from wildfire smoke plumes or desert dust storms. Once Pagan's volcanic activity ceased in 2011, the cyanobacterial bloom disappeared.

This problem is of relevance in offshore exploration where pipelines are laid either on or buried in the seabed. When such pipes carry oil and gas, the undulating topography of the sea floor and the internal motion of the fluid subject the entire structure to vibration due to bending forces and form the subject of our study. Our analysis revealed that in general, the seabed acts either as a damper or as a spring and in particular when we have sedimentation, the seabed geology permits the geomechanical property of the sediment cover to act only as a damper As expected, external excitation will increase the response of these pipes for which an amplification factor has been derived. For soft beds, high transverse vibrations were dampened by increasing the internal fluid velocity whereas they became amplified for hard beds.

The present study aimed to examine the impacts of exposure to an electrical field on fragments of two transplanted Acropora species. Two independently performed experimental set-ups were used to assess fragment survival and linear skeletal extension under varying electrical currents and in direct versus indirect contact to electrically charged substrate. Survival rates of transplants for A. yongei and A. pulchra were high in some treatments, but showed significantly lower survival when exposed to a high amperage, or when transplanted close to the bottom. Maximum skeletal extensions of transplants were observed in elevated controls of A. yongei (7.5 +/- 0.4 mm/month versus donor colony: 5.8 +/- 0.7 mm/month) and for A. pulchra fragments subjected to 1.67 A/m(2) (6.2 +/- 0.3 mm/month versus donor colony: 8.6 +/- 0.6 mm/month). The lowest extension rates were found for A. pulchra on unelevated control boards (1.2 +/- 0.2 mm/month). At the same time, treatments exceeding current strengths of 1.67 A/m(2) led to significantly smaller extension rates in both Acropora species. While a direct contact with the charged metal had a significant negative effect on growth and survival of A. yongei fragments, A. pulchra demonstrated a general tendency to smaller extension rates when exposed to an electrical current. Overall, lower extension rates of fragments indicated that A. pulchra was generally more sensitive to transplantation. Previous reports of significantly increased growth rates due to electrical stimulation could not be supported for the species examined.",,,,,,,,,10,0,0,0,8,0,11,,,1745-1000,1745-1019,,,,,,,,,,"Leibniz Ctr Trop Marine Ecol, D-28359 Bremen, Germany",,,,2014-02-05,WOS:000329776200002,,

Once production ceases, decommissioning options for the platform are assessed. The role that a platform's jacket plays as fish habitat can inform the decommissioning decision. In this study, conducted along the crossbeams of a California platform jacket and using an ROV, we compared estimates of fish diversity and densities determined from a targeted biological survey with those from a replicated structural survey. We found that the water column fish species assemblages characterized by the two methods were similar. By contrast, the two survey methods yielded different species assemblages inhabiting the crossbeam at the platform jacket base. This difference occurred because, at least off California, the platform jacket base species diversity tends to be highest where the bottom crossbeam is undercut, creating sheltering sites for many species. Because the structural method inadequately imaged the seafloor-crossbeam interface, particularly where a gap occurred between crossbeam and seafloor, substantial numbers of fishes were not visible. While we cannot extrapolate from this study to all platforms' worldwide, it is clear that routine platform structural integrity surveys may be a valuable source for opportunistic marine community surveys. Intentional planning of the structural survey to incorporate relatively minor variations (e.g., maintaining fixed ROV distance from the infrastructure and consistent 90 degrees camera angle) coupled with a deliberate consideration of the platform ecology (e.g., positioning the ROV to capture the seafloor-crossbeam interface) can substantially improve the effects on fish assemblage assessments from routine structural surveys without compromising the integrity assessment. We suggest that these biases should be both acknowledged and, understood when using routine structural surveys to inform platform ecology assessment. Additional consideration may be given to structural surveys that incorporate incremental adjustments to provide better data applicability to biological assessments.",,,,,,,,,6,0,0,0,2,0,6,,,1932-6203,,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Inst Marine Sci, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USAExxonMobil Upstream Res Co, Spring, TX USA",,,,2020-12-11,WOS:000592383400009,33170883,

On average, 13 large conger eels were present on the wreck with a mean weight of 14.4 kg.fish-1. Five others species contributed strongly to the total biomass (415 kg): the common two-banded sea bream (16%), the bogue (16 %), the striped red mullet (6%), the fork beard (6%) and the common sea bream (5%).

According to the dive centers, the number of conger eels and their size have decreased since the prohibition of fish feeding in 1996. But in the absence of any census, the reliability of this affirmation was questionable. Other factors could explain the decline of the conger eel population: (1) alteration of conger eel behaviour patterns; (2) the silting up and degradation of the wreck; (3) fishing pressure; (4) reproduction behaviour.",,,,,,,,,2,0,0,0,2,0,2,,,0241-8231,,,,,,,,,,,"GIS Posidonie, Groupement d'Interet Scientifique pour l'etude de l'environnement marin, Parc scientifique et technologique de Luminy, Case 901, 13288 Marseille Cedex 9, France",,,,2004-01-01,ZOOREC:ZOOR14012070430,,

Key stressors are changes in ecosystem functioning due to biodiversity loss caused by ocean warming (species replacement and migration, e.g. affecting kelp forests), sea level rise (e.g. loss of habitats including salt marshes), plastic pollution (e.g. entanglement and ingestion), alien species with increasing numbers of alien seaweeds (e.g. outcompeting native species and parasite transmission), overexploitation (e.g. loss of energy supply further up the food web), habitat destruction (e.g. loss of nursery areas for commercially important species) and ocean acidification (e.g. skeletal weakening of ecosystem engineers including coralline algal beds). These stressors are currently affecting biodiversity, and their impact can be projected for the future. All stressors may act alone or in synergy.

As the wreck is protected by law as an underwater cultural heritage (UCH) site, only non-intrusive methods could be used during surveys. In this study, we demonstrate how using multiple complementary remote sensing techniques can be advantageous with respect to acquiring a holistic overview of a recently discovered wreck site. In January 2016, the wreck was revisited, and a full photogrammetric survey of the site was conducted with a Sperre Subfighter 7500 medium class ROV. In addition to stereo camera images, HD-video and underwater hyperspectral imagery was also obtained from the wreck site. In terms of data analysis and interpretation, the emphasis was in the current study put on the photogrammetric 3D model and the underwater hyperspectral imagery. The former provided an excellent general overview of the Figaro wreck site, whereas the latter supplied detailed information from a 14.65-m(2) sub-area situated on the top of the wreck. By analyzing classified underwater hyperspectral imagery in context with supplementary information from the 3D model, the levels of biofouling associated with different marine archaeological substrate types were assessed.

To evaluate the overall perception of the effects of deployment, a survey of stakeholders' opinions was undertaken based on a set of questions addressing various dimensions (environmental, social, and economic).

The opinions of stakeholders were measured using summated rating scales. The results obtained reflect the most important issues be impacted and the possibility of using them as indicators of relative success or failure. From a total of 12 factor-sets of impacts, the results showed that in general the environmentally related were the ones having had the most positive results. The overall perception of the environmental factor-sets specified as the 'deployment area use' revealed that the artificial reefs were an incentive to users and that the structures were perceived as a satisfactory tool to support the fishery and its management. In both cases divers were the strongest supporters. A closer look at the results presented in the form of an AMOEBA plot showed that there were other factor-sets perceived as impacting positively in other dimensions. Such examples are the factor-sets 'opinion' and 'production and benefits'lying respectively in the social and economic dimensions.

The German World War II (WWII) submarine (U-864) lies at about 150 m below the sea surface, near the Norwegian North Sea island of Fedje. The submarine is estimated to have been carrying 67 t of elemental Hg, some of which has leaked on to surrounding sediment. The total Hg concentration in bottom surface sediment within a 200 m radius of the wreckage decreases from 100 g/kg d.w. at the wreckage hotspot to about 1 mg/kg d.w. at 100 m from the hotspot. The second wreck is a German WWII cargo ship (Nordvard), that lies at a depth of ca. 30 m near the Norwegian harbor of Moss. Oil leakage from Nordvard has contaminated the bottom coastal sediment with poly cyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH).

To assess decadal changes in rocky reef fish assemblages following MPA protection, fish assemblages were monitored regularly in the Port Stephens-Great Lakes Marine Park (PSGLMP), New South Wales, Australia, using Baited Remote Underwater Video (BRUVs) comparing between fished and non-fished zones. Spatial and temporal heterogeneity of fish assemblages and fishery targeted species were assessed from 2006-2016 at two no-take zones at Broughton and Fingal Islands, and compared with nearby fished areas. A total of 102 species from families was observed over the study, with fish assemblage response being dependent on both the spatial scales of MPA zoning and locations within the park, and the temporal scales assessed. Five fishery targeted families, Labridae, Scorpaenidae, Sparidae, Monacanthidae and Cheilodactylidae, increased in relative abundance within no-take zones, compared with fished zones, although the response was variable among families and between locations. While abundance increased at both locations following the implementation of no-take zones, a significant zoning effect was only detected at Broughton Island, with the Labridae and Sparidae displaying the greatest increases in relative abundance within the no-take zone. This study demonstrates that the response of fish assemblages and targeted fishery families to the implementation of no-take MPA zones varies both temporally, and between locations. Differences in the assemblage response between locations are likely driven by the size and habitats within the no-take zones and these factors need to be adequately considered in MPA planning.

The technique has the advantage of being non-destructive, and can therefore be used for monitoring in marine protected areas. However, acquisition of robust data using UVC is reliant on the ability of individual divers to accurately identify fish, and estimate their lengths. Both of these variables can be affected by observer bias, which may also differ among observers. This study examines a technique with the potential to quantify and correct for observer bias in individual divers.

There are relatively few bioherms (i.e., coral-built mounds) in the northern GOM, and most DSCs are attached to existing hard substrata (e.g., authigenically formed carbonate). The primary structure-forming, DSC in the GOM is Lophelia pertusa, but structure is also provided by other living and dead scleractinians, antipatharians (black corals), octocorals (gorgonians, soft corals), hydrocorals and sponges, as well as abundant rocky substrata. The best development of DSCs in the GOM was previously documented within Viosca Knoll oil and gas lease blocks 826 and 862/906 (north-central GOM) and on the Campeche Bank (southern GOM in Mexican waters). This paper documents extensive deep reef ecosystems composed of DSC and rocky hard-bottom recently surveyed on the West Florida Slope (WFS, eastern GOM) during six research cruises (2008-2012). Using multibeam sonar, CTD casts, and video from underwater vehicles, we describe the physical and oceanographic characteristics of these deep reefs and provide size or area estimates of deep coral and hardground habitats. The multibeam sonar analyses revealed hundreds of mounds and ridges, some of which were subsequently surveyed using underwater vehicles. Mounds and ridges in < 525 m depths were usually capped with living coral colonies, dominated by L. pertusa. An extensive rocky scarp, running roughly north-south for at least 229 km, supported lower abundances of scleractinian corals than the mounds and ridges, despite an abundance of settlement substrata. Areal comparisons suggested that the WFS may exceed other parts of the GOM slope in extent of living deep coral coverage and other deep-reef habitat (dead coral and rock). The complex WFS region warrants additional studies to better understand the influences of oceanography and geology on the occurrence of DSC and associated organisms.

(eds.), Technical Framework for the Gulf Regional Sediment Management Master Plan (GRSMMP), Journal of Coastal Research, Special Issue No. 60, 30-44.The Gulf of Mexico (GOM) continental shelf, extending approximately 1600 km from the Florida west coast to the U.S.-Mexico border, is a large sedimentary basin that has been the focus of much geologic study and surveys during the past 70 years, related mostly to oil and gas exploration. Relatively little attention has been focused on mapping and assessing offshore sediment character and resources, such as sand. It is increasingly recognized, however, that baseline scientific information on seafloor sediment character and composition is needed for managing and protecting natural resources and for providing information on sand availability and quality for potential use in a variety of coastal restoration and protection projects in all five of the states from Florida to Texas. The geomorphologic character and shallow sedimentary stratigraphy of the GOM shelf has been determined over geologic time by sediment inputs from rivers; sea-level fluctuations up to 120 m, resulting in transgressions and regressions of the shore; and frequent storms. These processes have resulted in deposition, reworking, and preservation of a variety of sand bodies, both on the seafloor and in buried, ancestral stream channels. Sand bodies of highly varying grain size, sorting, color, and composition are present throughout parts of the GOM inner shelf, varying greatly in size and number and often overlain or admixed with finer-grained, muddy sediment. The shelf sand bodies tend to be fine grained and are often mixed with muddy or organic detritus as well as carbonate shell material. The GOM shelf is mantled with sand mostly off the Florida shore, and sediments become progressively finer and muddier westward across the Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana, and Texas shelf regions. The shelf off each state contains shoals that represent drowned paleoshoreline and buried, ancestral, stream-channel features that originated when sea level was lower than at present and the shore was farther seaward. These shoals offer the best promise as potential sand resources; however, further study is needed to refine these findings based on reconnaissance-scale work.",,,,,,,,,18,0,0,0,8,0,19,,,0749-0208,1551-5036,,,,,,,,,,"US Geol Survey, Woods Hole Coastal & Marine Sci Ctr, Woods Hole, MA 02543 USAUS Geol Survey, St Petersburg Coastal & Marine Sci Ctr, St Petersburg, FL 33701 USAUniv Colorado, Inst Arctic & Alpine Res INSTAAR, Boulder, CO 80309 USACoastal Protect & Restorat Author CPRA, Baton Rouge, LA 70801 USAAtkins N Amer Coastal Planning & Restorat, Austin, TX 78730 USA",Coastal Protect & Restorat Author CPRAAtkins N Amer Coastal Planning & Restorat,,,2012-06-01,WOS:000304684700005,,

The 'impact' Near-Field platform is located 50 m from subsea oil production facilities. The 'control' Far-Field platform is 16 km distant from any industry seafloor activity. Each platform includes oceanographic, acoustic, and camera sensor modules. The latter carries two still cameras providing close-up and wide-angle views of the seabed.

Some of these ecosystems are vulnerable to widespread phase-changes that could fundamentally alter ecosystem properties such as habitat structure, species composition, fire regimes, or carbon storage. Others appear susceptible to major changes across only part of their geographic range, whereas yet others are susceptible to a large-scale decline of key biotic components, such as small mammals or stream-dwelling amphibians.

Recently there has been growing interest in connectivity between ecosystems and the potential for connected ecosystems to facilitative ecosystem services. Tropical seagrass meadows are connected to coral reefs, as the reef barrier dissipates waves, which facilitates sediment accumulation and avoid erosion and export. Therefore, coral reefs might enhance the seagrass meadows capacity as a blue carbon sink. We tested this hypothesis through an assessment of blue carbon across a gradient of connected seagrass meadow and coral reef sites. We assessed attributes of seagrass meadows along a transect in addition to classifying the sites as exposed and sheltered. Classification of sites was completed through analyzing wave crest density in photographs and using granulometric evenness index. Organic carbon and organic matter were measured in sediment core samples and within seagrass living biomass (both above and below ground). Lastly, we measured changes in above and below ground traits of seagrass plants across the same sites. Gaps in the reef barrier were linked to high wave disturbance and exposed conditions, whilst barrier continuity to low wave disturbance and sheltered conditions. Organic carbon in sediments was 144 Mg ha(-1) in the most sheltered (with reef barrier) and 91 Mg ha(-1) in the most exposed (without reef barrier) meadows. Sheltered conditions also showed a redistribution of seagrass biomass to a greater quantity of roots compared to rhizomes. Whilst in exposed conditions the opposite occurred, which could be due to increased rhizome biomass have to enhanced anchorage or greater nutrient availability. This study found that coral reefs facilitate blue carbon potential in seagrass meadows indicating that coral reefs support this important ecosystem service. Also, results suggest that loss of coral reef structure due to bleaching and other stressors will likely result in a reduction of the blue carbon storage capacity of adjacent seagrass meadow. Further research should investigate how combined global and regional stresses may impact on the potential for coral reefs to buffer seagrass meadows, and how these stresses affect the functional traits of seagrass plants.",,,,,,,,,12,0,0,0,6,0,12,,,,2296-7745,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Nacl Colombia, Fac Minas, Area Curricular Medio Ambiente, Medellin, ColombiaLeibniz Zentrum Marine Tropenforsch ZMT, Dept Ecol, Bremen, GermanyUniv Nacl Colombia, Fac Ciencias, Dept Biol, Bogota, Colombia",Leibniz Zentrum Marine Tropenforsch ZMT,,,2020-08-19,WOS:000556182100001,,

A simple optimality model predicts that mobile animals should respond to changes in mortality risk (mu) and growth rate (g) by shifting habitats in a way that maximizes net benefits. In this study, field caging and tethering experiments quantified habitat-specific growth rates and mortality risk, respectively, for three different sizes of a coral reef fish, Nassau grouper (Epinephelus striatus), during its juvenile tenure in off-reef nursery habitats. These sizes bracketed the size at which this species undergoes an ontogenetic habitat shift from the interstices of macroalgal clumps (algal habitat) to areas outside, or adjacent to, macroalgae and other physically complex microhabitats (postalgal habitats). Experimental results were used in a cost-benefit analysis to test the following alternative (but not mutually exclusive) a hypotheses: (1) juvenile grouper shift habitats in a way that maximizes growth rates (g); (2) juveniles shift habitats in a way that minimizes mortality (predation) risk (mu); and (3) if trade-offs exist between maximizing growth rate and minimizing mortality risk, juveniles shift habitats in a way that minimizes the ratio of mortality risk to growth rate (mu/g).Results suggested that small fish face a trade-off between living in the relatively safe algal habitat and achieving high growth rates in postalgal habitats. The value of mu/g was significantly lower in the algal than postalgal habitats for small fish, which typically reside in the algal habitat, and significantly lower in postalgal habitats for medium and large fish, which typically reside in postalgal habitats. Thus, habitat use by juvenile Nassau grouper was consistent with the minimize mu/g hypothesis. These results highlight how behavioral responses to ecological processes, such as changing predation risk with body size, determine distribution patterns of mobile animals.",,,,,,,,,350,2,0,0,308,0,396,,,0012-9658,1939-9170,,,,,,,,,,"N Carolina State Univ, Dept Marine Earth & Atmospher Sci, Raleigh, NC 27695 USA",,,,2000-08-01,WOS:000088888900016,,

Periodic removal of predators effectively reduced the species richness and abundance of predators on removal reefs. The difference between the number of predators on control and removal reefs was greatest immediately following the removal of predators and attenuated between removals. During periods of recruitment, species richness and total abundance of recently-recruited, non-piscivorous fishes were generally greater on predator-removal reefs than on control reefs. Species richness and total abundance of resident non-piscivorous fishes were not affected by the removal of predators in the first year of the experiment. Both abundance and species richness of residents, however, were greater on the removal reefs during the second year of the experiment. The difference in the responses of the two age classes to the removal of predators suggests that predators may affect community patterns of older age classes through time-lagged effects on the survivorship of younger age classes. At the end of the experiment, species richness was positively related to abundance for recruits and residents. The effects of removing piscivorous fishes on the abundance of non-piscivorous fishes were similar for species considered separately.

The artificial reef can be scanned over time to determine the degree of stability (movement or subsidence) and durability (degradation of reef material). A total 150 nautical miles of transects have been surveyed to date. These transects cover approximately 6000 acres of water bottoms.

However, empirical studies using stable endpoint pCO(2) concentrations find species exhibit variable biological and geochemical responses rather than the expected negative patterns. In addition, the carbonate chemistry of many marine systems is now being observed to be more variable than previously thought. To underpin more robust projections of future OA impacts on marine biomineralisers and their role in ecosystem service provision, we investigate coralline algal responses to realistically variable scenarios of marine pCO(2) enrichment. Coralline algae are important in ecosystem function; providing habitats and nursery areas, hosting high biodiversity, stabilizing reef structures and contributing to the carbon cycle. Red coralline marine algae were exposed for 80days to one of three pH treatments: (i) current pH (control); (ii) low pH (7.7) representing OA change; and (iii) an abrupt drop to low pH (7.7) representing the higher rates of pH change observed at natural vent systems, in areas of upwelling and during CCS releases. We demonstrate that red coralline algae respond differently to the rate and the magnitude of pH change induced by pCO(2) enrichment. At low pH, coralline algae survived by increasing their calcification rates. However, when the change to low pH occurred at a fast rate we detected, using Raman spectroscopy, weaknesses in the calcite skeleton, with evidence of dissolution and molecular positional disorder. This suggests that, while coralline algae will continue to calcify, they may be structurally weakened, putting at risk the ecosystem services they provide. Notwithstanding evolutionary adaptation, the ability of coralline algae to cope with OA may thus be determined primarily by the rate, rather than magnitude, at which pCO(2) enrichment occurs.",,,,,,,,,114,2,1,0,102,0,125,,,1354-1013,1365-2486,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Glasgow, Sch Geog & Earth Sci, Glasgow G12 8QQ, Lanark, ScotlandUniv St Andrews, Dept Earth Sci, St Andrews KY16 9AJ, Fife, ScotlandUniv Plymouth, Sch Marine Sci & Engn, Marine Biol & Ecol Res Ctr, Plymouth PL4 8AA, Devon, EnglandPlymouth Marine Lab, Plymouth PL1 3DH, Devon, EnglandCNRS, Lab Adaptat & Divers Milieu Marin, Stn Biol Roscoff, F-29688 Roscoff, FranceUniv Paris 06, Lab Adaptat & Divers Milieu Marin, Stn Biol Roscoff, F-29688 Roscoff, France",,,,2013-12-01,WOS:000326836000006,23943376,

Unsurprisingly, therefore, the use of marine protected areas (here defined widely to include fisheries closed areas and no-take marine reserves) in its management has generated considerable controversy-particularly with regards to the design of a regional ecologically coherent MPA network to meet international obligations.Drawing on three MPA processes currently occurring in the UK North Sea, we examine the real-world problems that make the designation of MPA networks challenging. The political problems include: disagreement among (and within) sectors over policy objectives and priorities, common access to fisheries resources at the EU level increasing the scale at which decisions have to be made and lack of an integrated strategy for implementing protected areas in the North Sea. The scientific problems include the patchy knowledge of benthic assemblages, limited knowledge of fishing gear-habitat interactions, and the increased risk of unforeseen externalities if human activity (predominantly fishing) is displaced from newly protected sites. Diverging stakeholder attitudes to these problems means that there is no consensus on what ecological coherence actually means.Ultimately, we caution against' quick-fix' solutions that are based on advocacy and targets, as they create confusion and undermine trust in the planning process. We argue for a more pragmatic approach to marine protection that embraces the complexity of the social and political arena in which decisions are made.",,,,,,,,,10,0,0,0,9,0,10,,,0065-2881,,978-0-12-800214-8,,,,,,,,,"Seafish Ind Author, Grimsby, EnglandNewcastle Univ, Sch Marine Sci & Technol, Newcastle Upon Tyne NE1 7RU, Tyne & Wear, EnglandUniv Bristol, Sch Law, Bristol, Avon, EnglandRoyal Soc Protect Birds, Sandy, Beds, EnglandUniv Hull, Ctr Environm & Marine Sci, Scarborough, N Yorkshire, EnglandUniv Liverpool, Sch Environm Sci, Liverpool L69 3BX, Merseyside, EnglandNewcastle Univ, Sch Geog Polit & Sociol, Newcastle Upon Tyne NE1 7RU, Tyne & Wear, England",Seafish Ind Author,,,2014-01-01,WOS:000349890300010,25358304,

Recruitment limitation implies little or no regulation of the reef-associated population, and is supported by several experimental studies that failed to detect density dependence. Previous manipulations of population density have, however, focused on juveniles, and there have been no tests for density-dependent interactions among adult reef fishes. I tested for population regulation in Coryphopterus glaucofraenum, a small, short-lived goby that is common in the Caribbean. Adult density was manipulated on artificial reefs and adults were also monitored on reefs where they varied in density naturally. Survival of adult gobies showed a strong inverse relationship with their initial density across a realistic range of densities. Individually marked gobies, however, grew at similar rates across all densities, suggesting that density-dependent survival was not associated with depressed growth, and so may result from predation or parasitism rather than from food shortage. Like adult survival, the accumulation of new recruits on reefs was also much lower at high adult densities than at low densities. Suppression of recruitment by adults may occur because adults cause either reduced larval settlement or reduced early post-settlement survival. In summary, this study has documented a previously unrecorded regulatory mechanism for reef fish populations (density-dependent adult mortality) and provided a particularly strong example of a well-established mechanism (density-dependent recruitment). In combination, these two compensatory mechanisms have the potential to strongly regulate the abundance of this species, and rule out the control of abundance by the supply of recruits.",,,,,,,,,134,0,1,0,55,1,147,,,0029-8549,1432-1939,,,,,,,,,,"UNIV CALIF SANTA BARBARA, DEPT BIOL SCI, SANTA BARBARA, CA 93106 USA",,,,1995-08-01,WOS:A1995RR94800003,28306820,

Such data streams are essential in evaluating population trajectories that are derived largely from harvest and age composition of landings. For example, high scientific uncertainty in the most recent stock assessment of Gulf of Mexico red snapper Lutjanus campechanus resulted from a conflict between trends in fishery-dependent and fishery-independent data. Because sample sizes for the latter data were an order of magnitude lower, resolution of the conflicting trends was even more problematic. Recognizing the need for cost-effective expansion of fishery-independent data in the region, we evaluated the performance of vertical longline surveys for sampling reef fish within a large artificial reef zone in the northern Gulf of Mexico. Specifically, we (1) determined species composition and the length frequency of red snapper (the dominant species captured) as a function of hook size and bait type within our survey area during 2010; (2) evaluated the effect of different soak times on catch for various hook types (a combination of hook size and bait type); and (3) utilized our results to test the effect of artificial reef type on red snapper CPUE and mean size. During March-November 2010, we conducted 532 vertical longline sets, capturing 1,217 red snapper that ranged from 184 to 827 mm FL. Mean FL of red snapper differed among hook sizes, with 3/0 and 8/0 hooks sampling smaller fish than 11/0 hooks. Soak time trials revealed a significant effect of soak time on CPUE, with peak catch rates observed at 5 min. As habitat area increased, the mean size and CPUE of red snapper increased. We conclude that our vertical longline is an effective gear for sampling red snapper, and we recommend protocols to maximize its utility and standardize its use.",,,,,,,,,16,0,0,0,16,0,22,,,0002-8487,1548-8659,,,,,,,,,,"Dauphin Isl Sea Lab, Ctr Ecosyst Based Fisheries Management, Dauphin Isl, AL 36528 USAColl William & Mary, Virginia Inst Marine Sci, Gloucester Point, VA 23062 USAAlabama Dept Conservat & Nat Resources, Dauphin Isl, AL 36528 USAUniv S Alabama, Mobile, AL 36688 USA",Alabama Dept Conservat & Nat Resources,,,2013-03-13,WOS:000315216000003,,

The generally destructive character of sea-floor diagenesis in such settings precludes ubiquitous inorganic precipitation of carbonates, yet these limestones include occasional units with marine cements: (1) within rare in situ biomounds; (2) within some stacked, cross-bedded sand bodies; (3) at the top of metre-scale, subtidal, carbonate cycles; and (4) most commonly, associated with certain unconformities. The marine cements are dominated by isopachous rinds of fibrous to bladed spar, interstitial homogeneous micrite and interstitial micropeloidal micrite, often precipitated sequentially in that order. Internal sedimentation of microbioclastic micrite may occur at any stage. The paradox of marine-cemented limestone units in an overall destructive cool-water diagenetic regime may be explained by the precipitation of cement as intermediate Mg-calcite from marine waters undersaturated with respect to aragonite. In some of the marine-cemented limestones, aragonite biomoulds may include marine cement/sediment internally, suggesting that dissolution of aragonite can at times be wholly marine and not always involve meteoric influences. We suggest that marine cementation occurred preferentially, but not exclusively, during periods of relatively lowered sea level, probably glacio-eustatically driven in the mid-Tertiary. At times of reduced sea level, there was a relative increase in both the temperature and the carbonate saturation state of the shelf waters, and the locus of carbonate sedimentation shifted towards formerly deeper shelf sites, which now experienced increased swell wave and/or tidal energy levels, fostering sediment abrasion and reworking, reduced sedimentation rates and freer exchange of sediment pore-waters. Energy levels were probably also enhanced by increased upwelling of cold, deep waters onto the Southern Ocean margins of the Australasian carbonate platforms, where water-mass mixing, warming and loss of CO2 locally maintained critical levels of carbonate saturation for sea-floor cement precipitation and promoted the phosphate-glauconite mineralization associated with some of the marine-cemented limestone units.",,,,,,,,,70,2,0,0,8,0,83,,,0037-0746,,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Waikato, Dept Earth Sci, Hamilton, New ZealandQueens Univ, Dept Geol Sci, Kingston, ON K7L 3N6, Canada",,,,2000-06-01,WOS:000087496200007,,

The sites are expected to be found on the Atlantic Oceans Continental Shelf of the Georgia Bight. Such sites are difficult to discover and study but are extremely relevant to understanding human entry adaptations in the Americas. This research seeks to develop a new method of underwater survey designed to overcome many of the costs and difficulties currently associated with underwater archaeological exploration. The study will exploit existing erosional features created around wrecks or artificial reefs. These exposures are compelling targets for archaeological testing because excavation has already been done by natural forces such as tidal currents. A successful study of scour nuclei offers us the ability to advance our understanding of the now drowned paleolandscape of the southeastern coastal plain along the Atlantic. This study will seek to improve current methodologies for survey and recovery of submerged archaeological sites. By so doing, it will broaden the typological and chronological framework for prehistoric sites on the southeastern U.S. continental shelf and it will contribute more broadly to research on drowned paleolandscapes nationally and globally.<br/><br/>This research will examine how natural oceanic forces may reduce effort and costs currently associated with the location and characterization of submerged archaeological sites. Such costs can be significant, and the technology required, while commercially available, does not normally provide an acceptable success rate with regard to prehistoric sites.

Storage of CO2 under the seabed moves this climate mitigation option away from inhabited areas and could thereby take away some of the opposition towards this technology. Given that in the event of CO2 leakage through the overburden in the case of sub-seabed CCS, the ocean could function as buffer for receiving this greenhouse gas, instead of it directly being emitted into the atmosphere, offshore CCS could also address concerns over the climatic impacts of CO2 seepage. We point out that recent geological studies provide evidence that to date CO2 has been safely stored under the seabed. Leakage for individual offshore CCS operations could thus be unlikely from a technical point of view, if storage sites are well chosen, well managed and well monitored. But we argue that on a global longterm scale, for an ensemble of thousands or millions of storage sites, leakage of CO2 could take place in certain cases and/or countries for e.g. economic, institutional, legal or safety-cultural reasons. In this paper we investigate what the impact could be in terms of temperature increase and ocean acidification if leakage occurs at a global level, and address the question what the relative roles could be of on- and offshore CCS if mankind desires to divert the damages resulting from climate change. For this purpose, we constructed a top-down energy-environment-economy model, with which we performed a probabilistic Monte-Carlo cost-benefit analysis of climate change mitigation with on- and offshore CCS as specific CO2 abatement options. One of our main conclusions is that, even under conditions with non-zero (permille/year) leakage for CCS activity globally, both onshore and offshore CCS should probably - on economic grounds at least - still account for anywhere between 20 % and 80 % of all future CO2 abatement efforts under a broad range of CCS cost assumptions.",,,,,,,,,9,0,0,0,1,0,9,,,0165-0009,1573-1480,,,,,,,,,,"Energy Res Ctr Netherlands ECN, Policy Studies, Amsterdam, NetherlandsJohns Hopkins Univ, Sch Adv Int Studies, Bologna, ItalyUniv Amsterdam, Fac Sci, Amsterdam, NetherlandsTilburg Univ, Tilburg Sustainabil Ctr, Dept Econ, Tilburg, NetherlandsTilburg Univ, CentER, Tilburg, Netherlands",Energy Res Ctr Netherlands ECN,,,2016-07-20,WOS:000378741900011,,

Movements between units of the artificial reef (excursions outside shelter) were predominantly nocturnal, peaking 1.5 to 3 h after sunset and returning to low levels shortly before dawn. A marked decline in the number of inter-reef unit movements from late summer to winter was related to decreasing water temperature rather than to daytime light level, wave height or tidal range. Activity indicated by the tilt switch was also greater at night, but declined gradually fr-om a peak early in the night to a minimum at around midday, on average, implying a degree of activity within reef units during daylight.

The vast pool of oil resulting from the Deepwater Horizon oil spill came into contact with a large portion of the Gulf of Mexico's floating Sargassum mats. Aerial surveys performed during and after the oil spill show compelling evidence of loss and subsequent recovery of Sargassum. Expanding on the trends observed in the aerial surveys, we conducted a series of mesocosm experiments to test the effect of oil and dispersants on the vertical position and weight of the Sargassum complex (Sargassum natans and S. fluitans), as well as on the dissolved oxygen concentrations surrounding the algae. Dispersant and dispersed-oil had significant effects on the vertical position of both species of Sargassum over a period of 72 hours. Similarly, dissolved oxygen concentrations were lowest in dispersant and dispersed-oil treatments, respectively. Cumulatively, our findings suggest three pathways for oil-spill related injury: (1) Sargassum accumulated oil on the surface exposing animals to high concentrations of contaminants; (2) application of dispersant sank Sargassum, thus removing the habitat and potentially transporting oil and dispersant vertically; and (3) low oxygen surrounded the habitat potentially stressing animals that reside in the alga. These pathways represent direct, sublethal, and indirect effects of oil and dispersant release that minimize the ecosystem services provided by floating Sargassum - the latter two effects are rarely considered in assessing impacts of oil spills or response procedures.",,,,,,,,,24,0,0,0,22,0,27,,,1932-6203,,,,,,,,,,,"Univ S Alabama, Dept Marine Sci, Mobile, AL 36688 USADauphin Isl Sea Lab, Dauphin Isl, AL USA",,,,2013-11-27,WOS:000325218700039,24086378,

The unstratified density of fish was between 1.6 and 3.4 fish 100 m-2 but locations of fish sightings were strongly positively correlated with two-dimensional cover of hard substrata within the site. Cheilodactylus nigripes was a diurnally active micro-carnivore which used hard substrata for shelter and for feeding on benthic invertebrates. Movement patterns were measured or inferred from spatial patterns of distribution and were found to be restricted to small areas within the confines of the pier. Home range was estimated to be 26 m-2 for one juvenile fish. Only juveniles lt = 12 cm TL defended space aggressively against intrusion by conspecifics and Fish gt 19 cm TL engaged in lateral displays with colour changes in agonistic encounters.

In August of 1871, 31 Yankee whaling ships were crushed by the ice and sunk, or burned near Point Belcher, Alaska. This event had enormous impact on the Native population and on the whaling community. Little is actually known about the location and condition of these significant wrecks. An attempt to locate wrecks in the 1990s had technical difficulties, but during testing of an underwater camera, a single wreck was located, demonstrating that some wrecks do remain on the ocean bottom. The customary approach to Arctic underwater exploration relies on a large and expensive support vessel, but the Point Belcher location is a good candidate for exploring with different, less costly methods. Due to the wrecks' expected close proximity to shore it is reasonable to expect that an accurate site survey can be accomplished with a small, land-based team using an inflatable vessel. The investigators have developed and successfully used these techniques for many years on Lake Superior and it is now reasonable to attempt to demonstrate their value on this type of arctic project. This project will be a research contribution by locating and documenting shipwrecks from the 1871 Yankee whaling ship disaster, while supplying a proof of concept for shore-based underwater exploration techniques in the Arctic. Results will allow for future access to important data sources (the wrecks) by investigators who are researching cultural history, materials longevity in Arctic waters, and marine colonization of artificial reefs. At no time during the project will any site disturbance or artifact retrieval take place. The project will have broader societal impacts through its direct collaborations with Native institutions (UIC Science Center and Inupiat Heritage Center), and with community organizations (North Slope Borough School District, Barrow Arctic Science Consortium), and through community presentations for the general public. The team will preliminarily assess the conditions of the wrecks and determine if further evaluation and documentation is warranted.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,518725,,,,,,,,Barrow Arctic Science Consortium (BASC),Barrow Arctic Science Consortium (BASC),,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:13574721,,

Until the second half of the twentieth century, however, little attention was given to protecting the marine ecosystem. Federal authority reaches out to two hundred miles or more in the oceans off the United States, covering an area known as the Outer Continental Shelf. Federal interest in the area historically focused on developing oil and gas reserves and ensuring that the area was open to trade and commerce. The area is also very important for indigenous subsistence uses and commercial and sport fisheries. Yet it has received scant attention from Congress in terms of environmental protection. Climate change and ocean acidification have increased recognition of the marine ecosystem's importance to the overall health of the planet. This Article reviews President Obama's recent withdrawal of swaths of the outer continental shelf from oil and gas leasing under the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act. It argues that while Congress has paramount authority over the outer continental shelf and retains the authority to undo conservation actions, it has delegated limited conservation authority to the president under section 12(a) of the Act. Thus, President Obama's recent protective measures taken under the Act may only be altered by Congress-not by a subsequent president. This Article compares the president's withdrawal authority under the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act to the president's authority to establish national monuments under the Antiquities Act. It argues that Congress did not delegate power to revoke national monument designations under the Antiquities Act, nor permanent withdrawals under section 12(a) of the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,0046-1121,,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Washington, Sch Law, Law, Seattle, WA 98195 USAUniv Washington, Sch Law, Native Amer Law Ctr, Seattle, WA 98195 USAHarvard Law Sch, Law, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",,,,2018-06-01,WOS:000431827200001,,

Climate drivers will alter deep-sea biodiversity and associated ecosystem services, and may interact with disturbance from resource extraction activities or even climate geoengineering. We suggest that to ensure the effective management of increasing use of the deep ocean (e.g., for bottom fishing, oil and gas extraction, and deep-seabed mining), environmental management and developing regulations must consider climate change. Strategic planning, impact assessment and monitoring, spatial management, application of the precautionary approach, and full-cost accounting of extraction activities should embrace climate consciousness. Coupled climate and biological modeling approaches applied in the water and on the seafloor can help accomplish this goal. For example, Earth-System Model projections of climate-change parameters at the seafloor reveal heterogeneity in projected climate hazard and time of emergence (beyond natural variability) in regions targeted for deep-seabed mining. Models that combine climate-induced changes in ocean circulation with particle tracking predict altered transport of early life stages (larvae) under climate change. Habitat suitability models can help assess the consequences of altered larval dispersal, predict climate refugia, and identify vulnerable regions for multiple species under climate change. Engaging the deep observing community can support the necessary data provisioning to mainstream climate into the development of environmental management plans. To illustrate this approach, we focus on deep-seabed mining and the International Seabed Authority, whose mandates include regulation of all mineral-related activities in international waters and protecting the marine environment from the harmful effects of mining.

A curious phenomenon reflecting ecological self-organization around reef habitat structures exists on coral reefs: large-scale (hundreds to hundreds of thousands of m(2)) halo-like patterns surrounding patch reefs, i.e., individual coral reefs that are often separated by seagrass or macroalgal meadows. These halos, long known to occur in various locations worldwide, reflect a distinct band of unvegetated sediments surrounding coral patch reefs. However, the full suite of mechanisms controlling them have never been rigorously explored, perhaps due to the common assumption dating back nearly 50 years that they arise solely from reef-based herbivory patterns shaped by anti-predator behavior. Here we provide empirical evidence from a set of halos within Australia's Great Barrier Reef that risk-averse foraging and a previously unrecognized functional group contribute to halo formation, demonstrating that these halos cannot be explained by any one mechanism in isolation. Our results show that halos are a more complex ecological phenomenon than previously assumed by the majority of studies of halos. Specifically, risk-averse grazing by herbivores is likely a key mechanism behind the formation of halos, as generally assumed, but bioturbators also play a central role. This knowledge furthers our understanding of how small-scale species interactions can structure habitat at landscape scales. These large-scale habitat features are important because they affect at least one important ecosystem function, carbon storage, and potentially others (e.g., biological nutrient transfer). These results also raise the question of whether other self-organized ecological patterns may be more nuanced than is currently assumed. This study capitalizes on recent advances in high resolution satellite imagery accessibility that allow ecologists to measure landscape-scale habitat features nearly everywhere on land and in shallow seas. Our results suggest that halos may hold potential as the basis for a tool for remotely observing ecological interactions and measuring large-scale ecosystem change on coral reefs.",,,,,,,,,23,0,0,0,21,0,24,,,2296-701X,,,,,,,,,,,"Macquarie Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Sydney, NSW, AustraliaUniv Hawaii, Hawaii Inst Marine Biol, Kaneohe, HI 96744 USAFlorida Int Univ, Dept Biol Sci, North Miami, FL USAUniv Queensland, Sch Biol Sci, St Lucia, Qld, AustraliaUniv Queensland, Australian Res Council Ctr Excellence Coral Reef, St Lucia, Qld, AustraliaUtah State Univ, Dept Watershed Sci, Logan, UT 84322 USAUtah State Univ, Ctr Ecol, Logan, UT 84322 USAUniv Queensland, Remote Sensing Res Ctr, Sch Earth & Environm Sci, St Lucia, Qld, AustraliaCharles Darwin Univ, Res Inst Environm & Livelihoods, Darwin, NT, Australia",,,,2019-04-24,WOS:000467431500001,,

Because estuaries are highly dynamic systems with fine-scale environmental gradients and microhabitats, it is challenging to identify foraging hotspots. To investigate whether bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus) foraging hotspots occur at fine spatial (500 m) and temporal (time of day and season) scales in a large estuary in the northern Gulf of Mexico, we conducted boat surveys from January to December 2001 in five subareas of Galveston Bay, totaling 3,815 km. Using geospatial techniques, we analyzed the number of dolphins, group behavior, and environmental variables (e.g., water temperature, salinity, turbidity, number of boats and seabirds, and distance to the Gulf) on a 500-m resolution grid. We observed 1,802 dolphins in 262 groups, 57% of which were foraging. Two subareas, Bolivar Roads and the Galveston Ship Channel, comprising only one-fifth of the total surveyed area, accounted for 91% of foraging groups. We identified six foraging hotspots in these two areas that were used throughout the day and in every season. Hotspots were located in deeper channels where dolphins often foraged with bottom trawl shrimp vessels, near ferry landings, and along the jetties where prey are likely exposed or aggregated by currents and tidal fronts. In addition, a greater number of seabirds and vessels were recorded in hotspots relative to where dolphins were not observed. We suggest that this fine spatiotemporal scale approach is a valuable tool for the conservation of vulnerable estuarine cetacean populations, particularly if paired with population and site-fidelity studies. Specifically, determining prime foraging habitat and identifying baseline hotspot density (number of foraging dolphins per unit area) provides useful metrics for detecting changes in habitat usage resulting from habitat degradation or restoration efforts.",,,,,,,,,7,0,0,0,5,0,8,,,0167-5427,,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Southern Mississippi, Div Coastal Sci, Gulf Coast Res Lab, 703 Beach Blvd, Ocean Springs, MS 39654 USA2302 Sandy Lane, Bryan, TX 77801 USA",,,,2018-12-28,WOS:000449756400011,,

Regular contact between fishing gear and pipelines may risk pipeline integrity and could lead to gear snagging. It is also known, anecdotally, that some vessels target pipelines, potentially benefiting from local artificial reef effects. The impacts of pipeline decommissioning options (removal vs. in situ) on commercial fisheries must be evaluated as part of the consenting process, but the degree of interaction between the two is presently unknown in the NS. Vessel Monitoring System (VMS) data for the Scottish demersal fleet were analysed with spatial data on pipelines. Approximately one-third (36.1%) of trips fished within 200 m of a pipeline over a 5-year period, suggesting that pipelines are subjected to regular interaction with fishing gear. The fishing effort (in hours) associated with pipelines was 2.52% of the total effort, compared to 1.33% in an equivalent area of seabed 1 km away, implying modest aggregation of fishing around pipelines. Only a small percentage (0.93%) of fishing trips actively targeted pipelines as fishing grounds. The highest level of fishing around pipelines occurred in the northeast NS. Pipeline sections with > 100 h of fishing were typically larger diameter pipelines. The results suggest that pipeline decommissioning may have both negative (displacement of aggregated effort) and positive (reduced snagging potential) outcomes for commercial fisheries. It is recommended that where there is little or no fishing activity associated with pipelines, receptors other than fishing should be prioritized when selecting decommissioning strategies. Additionally, the intensity of fishing around pipelines should be used to inform the frequency of post-decommissioning integrity monitoring for any pipelines left in situ.",,,,,,,,,28,0,0,0,17,0,28,,,1054-3139,1095-9289,,,,,,,,,,"Scottish Assoc Marine Sci, Ecol Dept, Oban PA37 1QA, Argyll, ScotlandMarine Scotland Sci, Renewables & Energy Programme, 375 Victoria Rd, Aberdeen AB11 9DB, Scotland",,,,2018-12-28,WOS:000424080500025,,

As wave energy technology matures and becomes more widespread, it is likely to result in further transformation of our coastal seas. Such changes are accompanied by uncertainty regarding their impacts on biodiversity. To date, impacts have not been assessed, as wave energy converters have yet to be fully developed. Therefore, there is a pressing need to build a framework of understanding regarding the potential impacts of these technologies, underpinned by methodologies that are transferable and scalable across sites to facilitate formal meta-analysis.

Today, most of the cuttings discharged from oil and gas installations contain water-based drilling muds, rather than oil-based or synthetic muds. Drill cuttings with water-based muds are assumed to cause only marginal effects on the benthos, mainly resulting from sedimentation. However, this statement has not been experimentally tested, which is the purpose of the present work. Natural sediment particles and water-based drill cuttings were added to benthic communities in layer thicknesses of 3-24 mm in a mesocosm set-up. During the following 6 months, changes in benthic community structure and fluxes of oxygen and nutrients across the sediment water interface were studied. There was a significant reduction in number of taxa, abundance, biomass and diversity of macrofauna with increasing thickness of drill cuttings, which was not observed for the natural sediment particles. The drill cuttings also influenced oxygen consumption and oxygen penetration depth in the sediment, and it was concluded that an organic compound in the drill cuttings initiated a typical eutrophication response. Fluxes of phosphate and silicate were, however, similarly affected by the two types of particles, and maximum fluxes occurred in sediments treated with thin layers (3-6 mm) of particles. As the response of water-based drill cuttings in the present study was a result of factors other than physical disturbance, we recommend a reconsideration of the assumption that water-based drill cuttings only cause sedimentation (burial) effects.

Michael University of Delaware Water and chemical fluxes between aquifers and the ocean are critically important to biological, geological, and geochemical processes at the coast. Groundwater inputs to the sea can cause algal blooms and modify ocean chemistry, and seawater infiltration to land causes aquifer salinization and alters solute and mineral composition of the subsurface. A unique challenge in quantifying aquifer-ocean fluxes is the wide range of spatial and temporal scales over which the mechanisms that drive exchange operate. Forcing occurs on timescales of waves, seasons, and glacial cycles, with corresponding spatial scales from ripples to continental shelves. Integrating the scales of exchange is essential for understanding and predicting the impacts of these fluxes through geologic history and as sea level changes in the future. The long-term vision of this work is to improve understanding of physical processes that connect aquifers and the sea through research and education that link geosciences and mathematics. The research project will explore the influence of geologic heterogeneity (spatial variations in hydrogeologic properties) on continental shelf-scale ocean-aquifer water exchange processes. Geostatistical modeling and variable-density groundwater flow and solute transport simulation will be used to understand the influence of the geometry of heterogeneity on (1) spatial patterns of seafloor water exchange, (2) density-driven saltwater circulation in the subsurface, and (3) seawater intrusion into aquifers, processes important for water resources, coastal ecosystems, and ocean chemistry. Two systems that display very different geometry and connectivity of geologic features will be modeled: the Bengal Delta and the Hawaiian Islands. This research will be linked to an educational program designed to integrate mathematics into geoscience curricula. A groundwater-surface water exchange activity for high school students in Delaware and Hawaii will be developed and implemented through cooperation with the Delaware Nature Society and Kamehmeha Schools, and new and modified undergraduate and graduate courses that incorporate aspects of the research will be offered at the University of Delaware. This project will create new knowledge of the physical processes that generate water exchange between aquifers and the ocean and the water and chemical fluxes that they produce. The work will fill a gap in understanding of the role of the geologic structure of an aquifer in translating these physical processes into groundwater salinization (flux from sea to land) and groundwater flow to the ocean (flux from land to sea) on the scale of the continental shelf. The work will have impacts on education, water resource management, and ecological preservation. Scientific results will provide water resources managers with a basis for improving management models and risk assessments. Insights gained will improve design of future field studies, enhance efforts to protect fragile coastal ecosystems, and may have implications for offshore drilling activities and siting of wind farms. Improved prediction of land-sea fluxes will also allow us to better anticipate and adapt to potential effects of climate change on coastal water resources and ecosystems.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,1151733,,,,,,,,University of Delaware,,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:13614648,,

Satellite transmitters were deployed on individual right whales in 2004, 2008 and 2009 to investigate whether their space-use patterns in the Southeastern Bering Sea (SEBS) were influenced by environmental conditions and to assess habitat use in areas of human interest. Whales were monitored for an average of 40 d (range 29-58 d) between July and October, a period in which they inhabited the SEBS shelf. Individuals tagged in 2008-2009 (cold years) remained in the middle shelf domain, travelled at a slower rate and showed a spatially more restricted habitat use than a whale tagged in 2004 (a warm year). Monte Carlo tests suggested that NPRWs associated with the cold pool (remnant winter water in the bottom layer of the middle shelf domain) during cold years, which is likely due to higher copepod abundance and reduced competition with other copepod predators within the cold pool. Telemetry data indicated that a Critical Habitat designated by the US National Marine Fisheries Service encompasses the main feeding range of NPRWs in the Bering Sea.

Long-term experiment (92 days) was carried out mimicking realistic conditions of pressure (similar to 30 bars) using the unique hyperbaric chamber (Karl Erik TiTank). The experiment was divided in three stages: i) 21 days of no CO2, ii) 50 days of simulation of carbon dioxide leakage (depletion of pH to 7.0) and iii) 14 days emulating a leakage cessation. Results suggested that bacterial communities can adapt to a CO2 leakage in short term. However, bacteria showed negative effects in terms of activity, community structure, and number of cells after long term CO2 exposure. After CO2 leakage cessation, bacterial communities did not show a significant recovery.

However, effects of ARs on marine communities remain unknown, because it is unclear whether ARs can maintain similar communities to natural reefs. We investigated whether well-established (> 30 years old) breakwaters could consistently approximate fish assemblages on interspersed rocky reefs in a temperate estuary over 6 consecutive seasons using regular visual surveys between June 2009 (winter) and November 2010 (spring). We examined whether assemblage differences between reef types were driven by differences in juvenile recruitment, or were related to differences in older life-stages. Assemblages on both reef types were dominated by juveniles (61% of individuals) and sub-adults (34% of individuals). Seasonal fluctuations in assemblage parameters (species richness, diversity, sub-adult abundance) were similar between reef types, and levels of species diversity and assemblage composition were generally comparable. However, abundance and species richness were consistently higher (1.9-7.6 and 1.3-2.6 times, respectively) on breakwaters. These assemblage differences could not be explained by differences in juvenile recruitment, with seasonal patterns of recruitment and juvenile species found to be similar between reef types. In contrast, abundances of sub-adults were consistently higher (1.1-12 times) at breakwaters, and assemblage differences appeared to be driven by this life-stage. Our results indicate that breakwaters in temperate estuaries are capable of supporting abundant and diverse fish assemblages with similar recruitment process to natural reefs. However, breakwaters may not approximate all aspects of natural assemblage structure, with differences maintained by a single-life stage in some cases.",,,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2015-09-03,DRCI:DATA2015155007148515,,

Therefore, it is of great significance to study deep-water bioherm reservoirs in the South China Sea. Comparisons of organic reefs in the four large islands of the South China Sea give evidences that such reefs in main sedimentary basins came into being during Cenozoic, especially in Neogene, and mainly occur as tower (point) reef, massive reef, platform-edge reef, and patch reef in shape, which show different reservoir physical properties and seismic reflection configurations and make up carbonate rock-bioherm formations in the island reef and sedimentary basin areas. Generally, the south and north parts differ from the east and the west of the South China Sea in geologic conditions, as their corresponding continental shelf/island shelf areas are relatively wide/narrow, large stream current systems are well developed/not so well developed, and terrigenous sediments are relatively sufficient/insufficient. The southeast and south parts of the South China Sea had organic reefs built up earlier than the north and the reef building mainly took place in Neogene; these Neogene organic reefs all belong to plant algal reef rocks. Liuhua oilfield in the Pearl River Mouth basin is found to mainly have red algal bindstone, Malampaya reef in the northern Palawan basin is rich in both red algal bindstone and green algal reef segmented rock, and especially Miocene red algal framestone and green algal segmented rock are discovered in the Xisha Islands.

Results showed that porpoise activity increased significantly at L so Trindel reef after the reconstruction in 2008.

An increase in mean encounter duration from 3.0 min in 2006 to 4.7 min in 2010 (3.7 min in 2012) showed that porpoises not only appeared more often, but also stayed longer at L so Trindel. Furthermore, there was a striking diel pattern in porpoise activity at L so Trindel, with significantly higher activity during the night. This pattern became increasingly apparent over the study period. At the reference station, in contrast, most activity took place during the day throughout the study.

In 2006, payao fisheries production was estimated at about 630,000 Mt, and large tuna species accounted for close to 400,000 Mt of this value.The three commercial fisheries that depend on payao are purse seine, ringnet, and handlines. Various sustenance fisheries are also based on the floating structure, but many of these are relatively minor.Purse seines and ringnets are used to harvest large size tunas, small tunas, and small pelagic species; these kinds of gear differ in terms of scale of operations, level of mechanization, and mode of fishing operation, but essentially capture the same species of similar size ranges.Among handlines, the most dominant handline gear used near payaos has generally been single, large circle hooks that are cast in deep waters (>100 m) to target large yellowfin Thunnus albacares and bigeye tuna Thunnus obesus. Smaller hooks are also used in relatively shallow waters to capture smaller sized yellowfin tuna.Meanwhile, multi-hooked handlines with colored lures are particularly designed for small pelagic species, and troll lines mainly harvest juveniles and adults of other (non-tuna) large pelagic species.Adaptations of fishing techniques to catch various associated species reflect the high level of consolidated fishing efforts near the floating structures.These techniques, in turn, highlight the growing concerns about overfishing and the sustainability of harvestable resources, as well as the need to regulate the deployment of payaos for effective payao fisheries management.",,,,,13th French-Japanese Oceanography Symposium13th French-Japanese Oceanography Symposium,20082008,French Acad Sci; Fdn Louis D; Embassy Japan; Maison Culture Japon Paris; Conseil Regional Provence Alpes Cote Azur; Conseil Gen Bouches Rhone; Municipal Marseille; Fac Pharm; Agence Eau Rhone Mediterranee Corse; Fondat Franco Japonaise Sasakawa; Ctr Oceanologie MarseilleFrench Acad Sci; Fdn Louis D; Embassy Japan; Maison Culture Japon Paris; Conseil Regional Provence Alpes Cote Azur; Conseil Gen Bouches Rhone; Municipal Marseille; Fac Pharm; Agence Eau Rhone Mediterranee Corse; Fondat Franco Japonaise Sasakawa; Ctr Oceanologie Marseille,"Marseille, FRANCEMarseille, FRANCE",2,0,0,0,0,0,2,,,,,978-90-481-8629-7,,,,,,,,,"Univ Philippines Visayas, Coll Fisheries & Ocean Sci, Iloilo 5023, PhilippinesKagoshima Univ, Fac Fisheries, Kagoshima 8900056, Japan",,,,2011-01-01,WOS:000329380000009,,

These features included size of brick shelters, size of rocks in rock piles, and the character of the underlying substrate. Experiments using brick shelters tested the ability of two lobster sizes (50-59 and 82-89 mm CL) to enlarge shelters by digging in sand-gravel bottom. If the gravel size was 1-2 cm both lobster sizes occupied > 90% of shelters by 22 h and the difference between occupancy at 2 and 22 It was not significant. If gravel size was 3-5 cm or 6-8 cm fewer shelters were occupied and the excavation of the sand/gravel took longer. Piles of three sizes of rocks were each placed on hard bottom as well as sand/1-2 cm gravel bottom, and the number of lobsters occupying each rock pile noted after 2-days. Six times more 70-79 mm CL lobsters and 1.7 times more 50-59 mm CL lobsters occupied rock piles on sand/gravel than hard bottom. For all rock sizes and substrates combined, three times more small than large lobsters sheltered in rock piles. The greater sheltering by lobsters on sand/gravel bottom and by smaller lobsters was thought to be related to the size of shelters available or that could be created between the rocks and the bottom by excavating under the rocks. Nearly all lobsters in the piles were located between the rocks and the bottom rather than among the rocks. A final experiment compared occupancy of 0.7 m and 1.2 m diameter rock piles by 60-69 mm CL lobsters where both pile sizes were of large rocks on sand-gravel. The larger piles attracted more lobsters, but neither the number/m(2) nor number/m circumference were significantly different. In summary, the substratum beneath a rock reef should be considered part of the reef's structure. Reefs housed more lobsters if the reef was placed on substrate they could excavate. Excavating a sand-gravel mix was easier where the gravel was smaller than 3-5 cm. Because lobsters mostly occupy shelters under the reef, reefs several rocks thick would add little to shelter availability.

The Seascape also includes critical habitats for globally threatened marine species, including sea turtles and cetaceans. Since 2001, the region has undergone rapid development in fisheries, oil and gas extraction, mining and logging. The expansion of these sectors, combined with illegal activities and poorly planned coastal development, is accelerating deterioration of coastal and marine environments. At the same time, regency governments have expanded their marine protected area networks to cover 3,594,702 ha of islands and coastal waters. Low population numbers, relatively healthy natural resources and a strong tenure system in eastern Indonesia provide an opportunity for government and local communities to collaboratively manage their resources sustainably to ensure long-term food security, while meeting their development aspirations.

However, I argue that the concept is deeply flawed; ecologically, socially and economically. Sustainability is strongly related, both historically and currently, to maximum long-term economic exploitation of a system. Counter-intuitively, in fisheries, achieving this economic exploitation often relies on government subsidies. While many fish populations are not sustainably fished biologically, even 'sustainably harvesting' fish results in major ecological changes to marine systems. These changes create unknown damage to ecosystem processes, including carbon capture potential of the ocean. The spatial scale of commercial fishing processes can also lead to social and food security issues in local, coastal communities that rely on fish for dietary needs. A radical alternative proposal is provided to the current situation. Ultimately, offshore fishing should be stopped completely and fish catches should rely instead on inshore fisheries. While such an approach may require a change in thinking and human behaviour regarding fish, I demonstrate that there are many benefits of this approach, including ecological, social and to local coastal economies, and few negatives, although management measures and coastal marine protected areas to protect vulnerable species and habitats would still be required. As such, the approach suggested is much more akin to a holistic definition of sustainability or 'prevention of ecological harm', rather than the maximum long-term exploitation of an ecosystem which is an underlying assumption of much fisheries and conservation research. While the suggestions in the study would benefit from further ecological, social and economic modelling, any movement towards restricting offshore catches should provide some degree of the benefits detailed.",,,,,,,,,6,0,0,0,3,0,6,,,2325-1026,,,,,,,,,,,"Bournemouth Univ, Dept Life & Environm Sci, Poole, Dorset, England",,,,2019-01-29,WOS:000457303900001,,

They sustain abundant marine life as well as commercial and artisanal fisheries, and help protect shorelines from coastal erosion. Additionally, seagrass meadows are a globally significant sink for carbon and represent a key ecosystem for combating climate change. However, seagrass habitats are suffering rapid global decline. Despite recognition of the importance of Blue Carbon, no functioning seagrass restoration or conservation projects supported by carbon finance currently operate, and the policies and frameworks to achieve this have not been developed. Yet, seagrass ecosystems could play a central role in addressing important international research questions regarding the natural mechanisms through which the ocean and the seabed can mitigate climate change, and how ecosystem structure links to service provision. The relative inattention that seagrass ecosystems have received represents both a serious oversight and a major missed opportunity. In this paper we review the prospects of further inclusion of seagrass ecosystems in climate policy frameworks, with a particular focus on carbon storage and sequestration, as well as the potential for developing payment for ecosystem service (PES) schemes that are complementary to carbon management. Prospects for the inclusion of seagrass Blue Carbon in regulatory compliance markets are currently limited; yet despite the risks the voluntary carbon sector offers the most immediately attractive avenue for the development of carbon credits. Given the array of ecosystem services seagrass ecosystems provide the most viable route to combat climate change, ensure seagrass conservation and improve livelihoods may be to complement any carbon payments with seagrass PES schemes based on the provision of additional ecosystem services.",,,,,,,,,63,1,0,0,30,0,66,,,,2296-7745,,,,,,,,,,"Univ York, Environm Dept, York, N Yorkshire, EnglandBangor Univ, Sch Ocean Sci, Anglesey, WalesEdinburgh Napier Univ, Sch Life Sport & Social Sci, Edinburgh, Midlothian, Scotland",,,,2015-01-01,WOS:000485324300034,,

Here, we use genetic markers (microsatellites) to identify the offspring of resident adult brown rockfish (Sebastes auriculatus) among incoming settling juveniles on an isolated artificial reef at Point Heyer in Puget Sound, thus directly estimating rates of self-recruitment on the reef. Due to low marker variability, unambiguous identification of these offspring from empirical data was not possible. Nevertheless, comparison between parent-offspring matches in observed and simulated genetic data suggested that self-recruitment was less than 10%. One of the juveniles genetically matching.an adult was confirmed as its offspring by larval otolith marking, which confirms that self-recruitment does occur.

Observations consisted of time-series measurements of water-column currents, temperature and salinity, and near-bed currents and suspended matter. The internal tide accounted for 15-25% of the water-column current variance and the barotropic tide accounted for up to 35%. The subtidal flow showed remarkably little shear and was dominated by the 714 day band, which is associated with relaxations in the dominant equatorward winds typical of coastal California in the spring and summer. Upwelling and relaxation events resulted in strong near-bed flows and accounted for almost half of the current stress on the seafloor (not accounting for wave orbital velocities), and may have driven along-shelf geostrophic flow during steady state conditions. Several elevated suspended particulate matter (SPM) events occurred within 3 m of the bed and were generally associated with higher, long-period surface waves. However, these peaks in SPM did not coincide with the predicted resuspension events from the modeled combined wave-current shear stress, indicating that the observed SPM at our site was most likely resuspended elsewhere and advected along-isobath. Sediment flux was almost equal in magnitude in the alongshore and cross-shore directions. Instances of wave-current shear stress that exceeded the threshold of resuspension for the silty-clays common at these water depths only occurred when near-bed orbital velocities due to long-period surface waves coincided with vigorous near-bed currents associated with the internal tide or upwelling/relaxation events. Thus upwelling/relaxation dynamics are primarily responsible for variability in the internal tide, as well as transport of near-bottom sediment in the mid-self mud belt during the relatively quiescent summer months.

Recently there has been growing interest in connectivity between ecosystems and the potential for connected ecosystems to facilitative ecosystem services. Tropical seagrass meadows are connected to coral reefs, as the reef barrier dissipates waves, which facilitates sediment accumulation and avoid erosion and export. Therefore, coral reefs might enhance the seagrass meadows capacity as a blue carbon sink. We tested this hypothesis through an assessment of blue carbon across a gradient of connected seagrass meadow and coral reef sites. We assessed attributes of seagrass meadows along a transect in addition to classifying the sites as exposed and sheltered. Classification of sites was completed through analyzing wave crest density in photographs and using granulometric evenness index. Organic carbon and organic matter were measured in sediment core samples and within seagrass living biomass (both above and below ground). Lastly, we measured changes in above and below ground traits of seagrass plants across the same sites. Gaps in the reef barrier were linked to high wave disturbance and exposed conditions, whilst barrier continuity to low wave disturbance and sheltered conditions. Organic carbon in sediments was 144 Mg ha-1 in the most sheltered (with reef barrier) and 91 Mg ha-1 in the most exposed (without reef barrier) meadows. Sheltered conditions also showed a redistribution of seagrass biomass to a greater quantity of roots compared to rhizomes. Whilst in exposed conditions the opposite occurred, which could be due to increased rhizome biomass have to enhanced anchorage or greater nutrient availability. This study found that coral reefs facilitate blue carbon potential in seagrass meadows indicating that coral reefs support this important ecosystem service. Also, results suggest that loss of coral reef structure due to bleaching and other stressors will likely result in a reduction of the blue carbon storage capacity of adjacent seagrass meadow. Further research should investigate how combined global and regional stresses may impact on the potential for coral reefs to buffer seagrass meadows, and how these stresses affect the functional traits of seagrass plants.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,,,2296-7745; 2296-7745,,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Nacl Colombia, Fac Minas, Medellin, Colombia",,,,2021-03-27,ZOOREC:ZOOR15704022260,,

Benthic fluxes of some chemical elements (e.g., C, N, P, O, Si, Fe, Mn, S) alter the redox state and marine carbonate system (i.e., pH and carbonate saturation state), which in turn modulate the functioning of benthic and pelagic ecosystems. The redox state of the near-bottom layer in many regions can change with time, responding to the supply of organic matter, physical regime, and coastal discharge. We developed a model ( BROM) to represent key biogeochemical processes in the water and sediments and to simulate changes occurring in the bottom boundary layer. BROM consists of a transport module (BROM-transport) and several biogeochemical modules that are fully compatible with the Framework for the Aquatic Biogeochemical Models, allowing independent coupling to hydrophysical models in 1-D, 2-D, or 3-D. We demonstrate that BROM is capable of simulating the seasonality in production and mineralization of organic matter as well as the mixing that leads to variations in redox conditions. BROM can be used for analyzing and interpreting data on sediment-water exchange, and for simulating the consequences of forcings such as climate change, external nutrient loading, ocean acidification, carbon storage leakage, and point-source metal pollution.",,,,,,,,,24,0,0,0,11,0,24,,,1991-959X,1991-9603,,,,,,,,,,"Norwegian Inst Water Res NIVA, Gaustadalleen 21, N-0349 Oslo, NorwayRAS, PP Shirshov Inst Oceanol, Nakhimovskiy prosp 36, Moscow 117991, RussiaPlymouth Marine Lab, Prospect Pl,Hoe, Plymouth PL1 3DH, Devon, EnglandNorwegian Inst Water Res NIVA Vest, Thormohlensgate 53 D, N-5006 Bergen, NorwayNorwegian Inst Air Res NILU, POB 100, N-2027 Kjeller, NorwayEast China Normal Univ, State Key Lab Estuarine & Coastal Res, Shanghai, Peoples R ChinaNorwegian Univ Sci & Technol NTNU, N-7491 Trondheim, NorwayUniv Waterloo, Ecohydrol Grp, Earth & Environm Sci, 200 Univ Ave West, Waterloo, ON N2L 3G2, Canada",,,,2017-02-01,WOS:000395089300002,,

The provision of fish passage past artificial structures in Victoria began in 1980, gained momentum in the mid to late 1990s, and peaked during 1998[long dash]2001 when over 60 fishways were constructed as part of the State Fishway Program. In 2000 the responsibility for prioritising stream barriers and installation of new fishways was passed to Victoria's Catchment Management Authorities (CMAs). After 30 years of fishway construction and 10 years of CMA management it is timely that the status of fishway performance and management be assessed in Victoria. This project was commissioned by the Sustainable Water Environments Division of the Department of Sustainability and Environment to support the Victorian Strategy for Healthy Rivers, Estuaries and Wetlands currently being developed. The project objectives are to: i. Review current Victorian approaches to providing fish passage at new instream structures. ii. Review current Victorian approaches to providing fish passage at existing instream structures. iii. Review the management, maintenance and operation of existing fishways in Victoria. iv. Develop recommendations to improve fish passage management in Victoria. i. Construction of new instream structures [long dash] legislation, strategies and implementation The legislation most relevant to provision of fish passage in Victoria includes the Water Act 1989, Conservation, Forests and Lands Act 1987 and Flora and Fauna Guarantee Act 1988. The Water Act stipulates that major works on waterways, such as the construction of dams and weirs, must be licensed, and that all possible social, economic and environmental impacts, including fish passage, must be considered. The Conservation Forest and Lands Act requires all public authorities to submit plans of works to the Secretary of the Department of Sustainability and Environment (DSE) for comment where works involve 'construction of dams, weirs or other structures in or across watercourses which potentially interfere with the movement of fish, or the quality of aquatic habitat'. The Flora and Fauna Guarantee Act provides specific protection of fish passage by noting that the 'prevention of passage of aquatic biota as a result of the presence of instream structures' is a 'potentially threatening process' and that 'there should be no further preventable decline in the viability of any rare species'. There are also a number of strategies supporting fish passage, such as the Victorian River Health Strategy 2002, CMA Regional Catchment Strategies, Melbourne Water's Community Environment Public Health Assessment (CEPHA) checklist and the Murray-Darling Basin Native Fish Strategy 2003[long dash]2013, as well as guidelines from DSE such as Technical Guidelines for Waterway Management and Guidelines for Assessment of Applications for Permits and Licences for Works on Waterways. These strategies and guidelines have been developed as best management practices in Victoria's catchments. But while collectively they are extensive, there is a lack of consistency in how different organisations obtain approval, assess works and implement fish passage requirements. Advice from DSE policy staff indicates that, apart from some dam safety improvement works, few fish passage referrals for exemption are made, indicating that new structures are either fully compliant with fish passage requirements through the Works on Waterways Permit or that, as anecdotally reported, some works such as new stream gauges, road crossings and flow regulators may have been constructed without sufficient referral or consultation. This report outlines recommendations to address these inconsistencies, including the development of a clear Statement of Obligations for the owners and managers of instream structures and the development of a centralised system to record all instream structures and fishways. * There is sufficient Victorian legislation to protect fish passage when constructing instream structures, however, a more consistently applied and concise assessment and approval process is required. * Development of a centralised system to document new instream structures and fishways is recommended. * A clear Statement of Obligations for Water Authorities and other owners of instream structures is required to ensure best environmental practice for fish passage. ii. Provision of fish passage at existing instream barriers in Victoria The Victorian fishway database compiled for this project contains 167 fishways or fish-passage- friendly works, and a further 14 high-priority fishways are proposed in the near future. In total these fish passage works represent an estimated Victorian investment of more than $5 million. Most fishway construction (83%) has been concentrated in four CMA regions: Melbourne Water (44 fishways), Goulburn[long dash]Broken CMA (39), Corangamite CMA (30) and Glenelg Hopkins CMA (26). The majority (61%) of fishways are rock ramps at low level weirs (usually less than a metre high) in coastal catchments to cater for smaller migratory fish species. This concentration of rock ramp fishways is largely due to the high ecological significance of Victoria's coastal migratory fish, the large number of smaller structures on coastal streams and the relatively low cost of construction for these fishways. Most vertical-slot fishways (10% of all fishways) have been constructed in the catchments of the Goulburn and Broken Rivers to cater for large migratory fish species. This is largely because of the high significance of these fish populations and the prevalence of instream barriers in the catchments. Other fish passage activities, such as the removal of redundant weirs and the installation of fish- friendly road culverts or erosion control works have been prevalent in the Corangamite and Melbourne Water catchments. The Melbourne Water, Mallee, North Central and Corangamite CMA regions have commissioned detailed reviews of instream barriers to fish passage to provide a standardised approach to identifying priorities for works programs. All regions should be encouraged to prioritise barriers to fish passage. Combining information from these reviews with the priority lists developed from 1996 to 1999 by the Fishway Implementation Committee, a total of 72 high priority barriers have been listed for Victoria. It is encouraging that 51 of these have been modified to restore fish passage, but a number of these appear to have significant performance or maintenance issues and a more formal assessment of their effectiveness is required. Only 7 (26%) of the 27 potentially redundant weirs identified in 2003 have been decommissioned. There is a large degree of inconsistency in the design and application of fishway technology between management organisations. In many cases it appears that new fishways have been constructed without consulting experienced engineers and fish biologists, and consequently some of these have seriously flawed designs. This is unfortunate, particularly given that there are now several fishways in south eastern Australia that have incorporated contemporary design improvements and are working examples of world's best practice fishways. * The level of adoption and quality of design for fishways at existing instream barriers varies considerably throughout Victoria. * The involvement of specialist engineers and biologists should be advocated during construction of all fishways. This is essential for all large structures (> 1 m high). * Catchment-based prioritisation of instream barriers to fish passage is highly recommended for all regions. * There is a need for a contemporary and comprehensive suite of fish passage design guidelines for small scale structures such as stream-gauging weirs. iv. Recommendations for improved fishway management in Victoria Over the past 15 years the impetus for establishing fishways has led to the evolution of a holistic goal of restoring fish passage for whole fish communities and other aquatic biota, rather than just large adults of a few commercially or recreationally important species. Research has also demonstrated significant fish movement both upstream and downstream, highlighting the need for fish passage in both directions. While it appears that most fishways are managed for positive environmental outcomes, there is a need for a more coordinated approach that will lead to more consistent outcomes using contemporary designs and technology. A set of principles are required to outline the design obligations of each fishway built across Victoria. To this end, draft design principles are provided in this report to assist the formulation of more specific design objectives. Because of the lack of coordination and clear design and review protocols, it appears that relevant DSE staff and other technical experts are consulted ad hoc regarding fish passage issues. As a result there is significant inconsistency in applying current best practice for fishway site prioritisation, design, performance assessment, and development of maintenance and operating programs. A more consistent approach to the management of fishways is required to provide effective and efficient fish passage at instream barriers across the state. These recommendations have been formulated with the help of waterway managers (DSE, CMAs, Melbourne Water, Southern Rural Water and Goulburn Murray Water) and colleagues involved in fish passage to enhance the effectiveness of legislation and management around fish passage issues in Victoria. There are four main areas that still require additional consideration: how proposals for instream works and weir refurbishments are to be assessed; the development and implementation of fishway design and construction processes; detailed fishway performance and maintenance criteria; and re-establishing a fish passage technical panel. Summary of key recommendations 1. Develop a Statement of Obligations for Water Authorities and other owners of instream structures to clearly define responsibilities for the provision, performance and maintenance of fish passage. 2. Develop consistent procedures, protocols and standards for the appropriate design, approval and construction of fishways. 3. Develop a suite of fish passage design guidelines for use at small-scale structures such as stream-gauging weirs. 4. Develop fishway performance, operation and maintenance guidelines for each Victorian fishway to ensure they are appropriate for Victorian conditions and fish species. 5. Re-establish a fish passage technical review panel to support implementation processes for prioritising, designing, constructing and managing fishways.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,0810-5774,,,,,,,,,,,"Arthur Rylah Institute for Environmental Research, 123 Brown Street, Heidelberg, Victoria 3084, Australia",,,,2011-05-25,ZOOREC:ZOOR14706045653,,

S. Department of Interior (DOI), Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) to generate a Best Management Practices (BMPs) document on sub-seabed geologic sequestration of carbon dioxide (CO2) below the U. S. outer continental shelf. The team consists of scientists, engineers, lawyers, and business managers from academia, private industry, and State of Texas government from the following institutions: (1) Gulf Coast Carbon Center at the Bureau of Economic Geology (BEG), (2) Det Norske Veritas (USA) Inc (DNV), (3) Wood Group Mustang and sister company Wood Group Kenny (Wood Group), (4) Texas General Land Office (GLO), (5) Harte Research Institute for Gulf of Mexico Studies at Texas A&M University-Corpus Christi (HRI), and (6) The University of Houston Law Center. Individual team members have expertise in carbon sequestration monitoring, CO2-pipeline design and construction, and domestic and international offshore environmental policy. The BMPs will be reviewed by external experts after it is generated and before being submitted to BOEM. The purpose of the BMPs will be to provide technical guidance to BOEM and BSEE (U. S. DOI Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement) to establish regulatory guidelines for offshore components of future U. S. Carbon Capture and Storage, which is sometimes referred to as sequestration, (CCS) industry.Sub-seabed geologic sequestration (GS) is the process whereby CO2 captured from large volume industrial sources (e. g., power plants, oil refineries) will be (1) compressed to supercritical state and transported via pipeline to offshore injection wells, and (2) injected into geologic strata deep (thousands of feet) below the seafloor. Objectives of the CO2 injection will be for pure sequestration (i.e., long-term storage of CO2 in subseafloor saline reservoirs) or sequestration combined with enhanced oil recovery (EOR). Sub-seabed geologic sequestration is very different from ocean dumping (i.e. dissolution of CO2 into circulating seawater) or injection of CO2 into deep water, shallow sub-seabed sediments. Some researchers proposed in the past that shallow subseafloor depths (< 1,000 ft) were sufficient for permanent CO2 storage in deep marine environments (> 11,000 ft water depth) (e. g., House et al., 2006). However, the shallow sedimentary subseafloor environment could become unstable and allow release of CO2 into ocean water, the end result of which would be ocean dumping. One mechanism of seafloor instability could be the release of gas from hydrates owing to pressure and temperature perturbations that may be introduced by shallow drilling and CO2 injection. Furthermore, the logistics of transporting CO2 hundreds of miles offshore to areas with sufficient water depths for storage in shallow subsea sediments would probably not be economically feasible. We want to emphasize that subseabed GS of CO2 is not ocean dumping.One of the biggest concerns for onshore GS is the potential to impact shallow drinking water resources. Injecting CO2 deep below the seafloor will avoid this potential consequence. But there are sensitive marine environments of concern in offshore settings, protection of which is critical. Environmental monitoring of marine ecosystems (nearshore, along CO2 pipeline corridors, and outer continental shelf) and subseafloor geological strata in which CO2 will be injected will be a large component of the BMPs. Topics being included in the BMPs, a draft of which will be submitted to BOEM in June of 2013, are: (1) site selection and characterization, (2) risk analysis, (3) project planning and execution, (4) environmental monitoring, (5) mitigation, (6) inspection and auditing, (7) reporting requirements, (8) emergency response and contingency planning, (9) decommissioning and site closure, and (10) legal issues. Where possible, we are using existing regulatory, policy, and technical guidance documents as a starting point for the BMPs. We think the most likely location for initiation of U. S. offshore geologic sequestration of CO2 will be in the western or central sectors of the Gulf of Mexico where extensive offshore oil and gas infrastructure already exists. Academic members of our project team are actively working on criteria for site selection [1]. However, private industry is also assessing the feasibility of offshore geologic sequestration below the Atlantic seafloor [2].",,,,,MTS/IEEE Oceans ConferenceMTS/IEEE Oceans Conference,"OCT 14-19, 2012OCT 14-19, 2012",IEEE; Marine Technol Soc (MTS); IEEE OES (IEEE/OES)IEEE; Marine Technol Soc (MTS); IEEE OES (IEEE/OES),"Virginia Beach, VAVirginia Beach, VA",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,978-1-4673-0829-8,,,,,,,,,"Univ Texas Austin, Bur Econ Geol, Jackson Sch Geosci, Austin, TX 78712 USA",,,,2013-05-05,WOS:000315350300189,,

To make up for reduced production from maturing fields, oil and gas exploration activities on the Norwegian continental shelf have greatly increased over the past several years. Strict emission controls have resulted in a substantial reduction in the release of hazardous chemicals. However, because of the increased exploration the discharges of water-based drill cuttings and muds have increased substantially, temporarily increasing water column sediment loads. The stony coral Lophelia pertusa is the most widely distributed and well-studied of the structure forming cold water corals (CWC) and it thrives in Norwegian waters where many reefs are located in the vicinity of oil platforms or exploration areas. This species provides habitat for a diverse and abundant assemblage of invertebrates and fishes, including commercially valuable species. High sediment loads are known to negatively affect adult corals, but impacts on the early life history stages are unknown. We investigated the effects of a range of drill cutting concentrations (0.5-640 ppm) on larvae of L. pertusa at ages five days and 15-20 days. One set of experiments was conducted in static experimental chambers that exposed larvae to decreasing concentrations over time, and the other maintained continuous drill cutting concentrations for the duration of the experiment (24 h). Increased sediment load for a duration of 24 h caused significant larval mortality, but there was an age-dependent difference in sensitivity of larvae. Younger larvae were significantly more susceptible to lower concentrations of drill cuttings than older larvae, while the older larvae were significantly more affected at higher concentrations. Five day old larvae were affected at treatment concentration 40 ppm. The larval cilia became clogged, preventing the larvae from swimming actively and ultimately causing mortality. Larvae of many species use cilia for swimming and feeding, so negative impacts of increased sediment may not be limited to corals. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

The EEM program was developed with guidance from experts in government, academia and elsewhere, and with input from the public. The EEM program proposed by Suncor was accepted by Canadian regulatory agencies and the program was implemented in 2000, 2001, 2002, 2004, 2006, 2008 and 2010, with pre-development sampling in 1997. The program continues to be implemented every two years. EEM includes an assessment of alterations in sediment quality through examination of changes in sediment chemistry, particle size, toxicity and benthic invertebrate community structure. A second component of the program examines potential effects on two species of commercial fishing interest: Iceland scallop (Chlamys islandica) and American plaice (Hippoglossoides platessoides). Chemical body burden for these two species is examined and taste tests are performed to assess the presence of taint in edible tissues. Effects on American plaice bioindicators are also examined. A final component of the program assesses potential effects of the Terra Nova development on water quality and examines water column chemistry, chlorophyll concentration and physical properties. The papers presented in this collection focus on effects of drill cuttings and drilling muds on the seafloor environment and, as such, report results on sediment quality and bioaccumulation of drilling mud components in Iceland scallop and American plaice.

This study provides the first information on the impact of high temperature (12 °C) and high CO2 (817 ppm) on intracellular DMSP in the cold-water coral Lophelia pertusa from the Mingulay Reef Complex, Scotland (56°49' N, 07°23' W), where in situ environmental conditions are meditated by tidally induced downwellings. An increase in intracellular DMSP under high CO2 conditions was observed, whilst water column particulate DMS + DMSP was reduced. In both high temperature treatments, intracellular DMSP was similar to the control treatment, whilst dissolved DMSP + DMS was not significantly different between any of the treatments. These results suggest that L. pertusa accumulates DMSP from the surrounding water column; uptake may be up-regulated under high CO2 conditions, but mediated by high temperature. These results provide new insight into the biotic control of deep-sea biogeochemistry and may impact our understanding of the global sulphur cycle, and the survival of cold-water corals under projected global change.

Predation by large pelagic predators was estimated to account 83% of red snapper and 100% of gray triggerfish discard mortality.

A SAC has an outer skin of tubular plastic netting stuffed with used herring gillnet; the stuffed portion was 83 X 26 cm. Alaska Department of Fish and Game deployed 1,280 SACs in Chiniak Bay, Kodiak Island, Alaska from 1989-1991 in ocean waters from 1 to 92 m deep. These collectors were attached to a groundline and fished 5 to 28 per string in a longline fashion. Of seven different artificial collectors tested, SACs were found to be the best to collect young king crabs. There were 105 glaucothoe larvae and 4,678 YOY red king crabs retrieved from 906 SACs. SACs are being used in an attempt to estimate future recruitment to the commercial fishery by indexing YOY red king crabs with adult crabs from the same cohorts. SACs also were used to define crab settling periods, range of settling depths and distribution. Growth of crabs in SACs for a year was summarized. An estimated 30,000 marine organisms from 93 taxa and 10 phyla were collected from 240 SACs.

Recently there has been growing interest in connectivity between ecosystems and the potential for connected ecosystems to facilitative ecosystem services. Tropical seagrass meadows are connected to coral reefs, as the reef barrier dissipates waves, which facilitates sediment accumulation and avoid erosion and export. Therefore, coral reefs might enhance the seagrass meadows capacity as a blue carbon sink. We tested this hypothesis through an assessment of blue carbon across a gradient of connected seagrass meadow and coral reef sites. We assessed attributes of seagrass meadows along a transect in addition to classifying the sites as exposed and sheltered. Classification of sites was completed through analyzing wave crest density in photographs and using granulometric evenness index. Organic carbon and organic matter were measured in sediment core samples and within seagrass living biomass (both above and below ground). Lastly, we measured changes in above and below ground traits of seagrass plants across the same sites. Gaps in the reef barrier were linked to high wave disturbance and exposed conditions, whilst barrier continuity to low wave disturbance and sheltered conditions. Organic carbon in sediments was 144 Mg ha-1 in the most sheltered (with reef barrier) and 91 Mg ha-1 in the most exposed (without reef barrier) meadows. Sheltered conditions also showed a redistribution of seagrass biomass to a greater quantity of roots compared to rhizomes. Whilst in exposed conditions the opposite occurred, which could be due to increased rhizome biomass have to enhanced anchorage or greater nutrient availability. This study found that coral reefs facilitate blue carbon potential in seagrass meadows indicating that coral reefs support this important ecosystem service. Also, results suggest that loss of coral reef structure due to bleaching and other stressors will likely result in a reduction of the blue carbon storage capacity of adjacent seagrass meadow. Further research should investigate how combined global and regional stresses may impact on the potential for coral reefs to buffer seagrass meadows, and how these stresses affect the functional traits of seagrass plants.

The Northwest Passage through the Canadian Arctic has also become ice-free several times in recent summers, a significant change. All of the Arctic countries, including Russia, the United States, Canada, and Denmark (Greenland) are exploring the limits of their arctic continental shelves in order to advance claims under the Law of the Sea Treaty. Within this context of environmental and likely socio-economic changes, wildlife populations and human communities are adjusting to these shifts in seasonal sea ice coverage and climatic warming that has been much more obvious than at lower latitudes. Subsistence hunting patterns in the Arctic are changing, and it is also clear that many organisms, from plankton to top predators may be changing their migration and foraging patterns. Productivity is also forecast to change as sea ice declines and penetration of sunlight into open water increases. The Pacific Marine Arctic Regional Synthesis (*PacMARS*) is a research synthesis effort underwritten by the North Pacific Marine Research Institute to assemble by mid-year 2013 up-to-date written documentation that contributes to understanding the Pacific-influenced coastal shelf ecosystem of the Arctic Ocean. Our study area extends from Saint Lawrence Island in the Bering Sea through Bering Strait into the Chukchi and Beaufort Seas and our objective is to compile the best available knowledge from local communities, peer-reviewed social and natural sciences, as well as less readily available knowledge sources. The overall goal is to provide guidance for scientific research needs in the region, as well as to serve stakeholder needs for understanding this important ecosystem and its vulnerabilities.

This shelf represents a modem, high dynamic mixed shelf system. It is inserted in the Potiguar Basin, which is the most productive oil and gas Brazilian basin onshore. Moreover, this entire coast is under severe erosion. Hydrodynamic and sediment dynamic processes reflect forcing by high waves, wind power, and mesotidal regime. This high-energy setting associated with mixed sedimentation supports the presence of highly variable seabed features (e.g. dunes, reefs and isolated sand bodies). The development of such great bedforms on the shelf reflects strong currents and tidal effects. The current speed values recorded occur within the interval 1,2 :5 I-VI >= 77,1 cm.s(-1), with the main direction to the SW. The integration of these data allows the seabed characteristics to be related to the current pattern. This kind of information is very important to help contingency plans, to understand why erosion occurs in the S5o Bento area, and in conflict resolution (e.g. the oil industry, fishing, tourism).

These rock outcrops have often been viewed as largely self-supporting systems, but some studies have suggested that the fish and invertebrate predators that use the ledges for shelter are strongly dependent on food from adjacent, soft-bottom habitats. We examined benthic macrofaunal abundances along two 75-m transects away from a rock ledge near Wrightsville Beach, North Carolina (depth ca. 30 m) in July 1990 and April 1991. The July 1990 samples indicated significantly higher abundances of total infauna, and of polychaetes, bivalves, isopods, and scaphopods, at a distance of 75 m from the rock ledge. In April 1991, when macrofaunal abundances were generally higher than in the previous summer, distributions of major taxa with distance from the rock ledge were more variable. Caging studies on macrofaunal abundances 10 m from the ledge, and video observations of fish abundances at 10 and 75 m from the ledge, provide support for a trophic link between the rock ledge and the adjacent soft-bottom communities.

A generalized additive modeling approach was used to characterize relationships between environmental variables and the relative abundance of red snapper Lutjanus campechanus over unconsolidated substrate on the continental shelf (300 mm FL). Fisheries independent data (2008-2014) were used to develop separate models for both the eastern and western GoM, and final models were used to predict the relative availability of suitable habitat for each life stage across the two regions. Predictor variables included in final models varied by age class and region, with depth, dissolved oxygen, longitude, and distance to artificial structure common to most models. Depth was among the most influential variables in all models, and preferred depth increased with increasing size/age. Regional differences in fish-habitat relationships were also observed, as relative abundance of larger red snapper over unconsolidated substrates was more closely linked to artificial structure in the eastern GoM. The location of predicted high quality habitat for juvenile red snapper was greatest on the inner Texas shelf and a smaller area east of the Mississippi River Delta, suggesting these two areas may represent important nursery grounds for the respective regions. Clear ontogenetic shifts in the spatial distribution of predicted high quality habitat were evident in both the eastern (expansion from west to east with age) and western (shift from inshore to offshore) GoM. Given the unique population dynamics between the eastern and western GoM, improving our understanding of spatial and temporal variability in habitat quality may be important to maintaining connectivity between juvenile and adult habitats, and may enhance recovery and management of red snapper stocks in the GoM.

The model included 17 functional groups, covering nearly all the main processes of the energy flow in Laoshan Bay artificial reef ecosystem. Network analysis showed that the trophic level of the functional groups varied from 1.0-4.255, and Conger myriaster occupied the highest trophic level. Five discrete trophic levels were found, and the mean trophic transfer efficiency was 10.8%, with a mean transfer efficiency of 10.9% from detritus and 9.8% from the primary producers within the ecosystem. The total system throughput was estimated to be 14256.510 t km-2 y-1, with 68% originated from detritus.

Because most research on boundary currents in general, and the California Current System (CCS) in particular, have been restricted to only small portions of the systems, it is largely unknown whether fish assemblages in boundary currents form one coherent ecosystem or if changes in assemblage structure are locally independent. We expand the geographic scope of previous analyses on ichthyoplankton assemblages within boundary currents by comparing dynamics in 2 widely separated regions of the CCS: Oregon (similar to 45 degrees N) and southern California (similar to 34 degrees N) in spring and summer from 2004 to 2011. Both region and season affected assemblage structure. Some taxa that were moderately common in California were consistently rare or absent in Oregon (and vice versa), and the presence of most decreased in summer in both regions. However, the assemblages were very similar in some years. Off Oregon, the assemblage most resembled California's when the ocean temperature was relatively high and northern anchovy Engraulis mordax was abundant. Assemblage dynamics were well explained by environmental change in Oregon. By contrast, California's assemblage and environmental variability correlated poorly. Population sizes of taxa common to both regions did not fluctuate coherently in Oregon and California. These findings are important for EBM because they indicate that it is not possible to extrapolate results from spatially restricted localities to understand assemblage dynamics throughout the entire CCS.",,,,,,,,,9,0,0,0,6,0,9,,,0171-8630,1616-1599,,,,,,,,,,"NOAA Fisheries Serv, Southwest Fisheries Sci Ctr, La Jolla, CA 92037 USAPacific States Marine Fisheries Commiss, Hatfield Marine Sci Ctr, Newport, OR 97365 USANOAA Fisheries Serv, NW Fisheries Sci Ctr, Hatfield Marine Sci Ctr, Newport, OR 97365 USA",Pacific States Marine Fisheries Commiss,,,2014-01-01,WOS:000338120000013,,

Attention was focussed upon economically important fish and their habitat, the concern for other components of aquatic ecosystems (such as invertebrates) and their inter-relationships, and the need to ensure the perpetuation of such resources for future use. The information presented in this report is supplemental to that provided in Initial Environmental Evaluations by Petro-Canada and Chevron who were the proponents of offshore oil and gas exploration. The vulnerability of fishery resources (groundfish, herring, and salmonids) to spilled oil is revealed through the provision of information on the effects on different stages in the life history of these fishery resources. The effects of hydrocarbons on survival, growth, physiology, behavior, and disease resistance of these fish exemplify concern for their well being, and the habitats they utilize. Information is also provided on the effects of oil on invertebrates (zooplankton, crabs, shrimps and prawns, bivalves and benthic communities), and the implications to marine food webs (including the concern for marine mammals). An improved understanding of natural ecosystems, relevant ecotoxicological studies, and an evaluation of spill countermeasures are topics requiring further research and understanding. The level of concern for the biological resources at risk from oil spillage along the coastline of BC is emphasized, and illustrated through the use of scenarios of oil well blowouts. These scenarios used the West Coast Offshore Oil and Gas Exploration Environmental Assessment Panel's postulated 50-day spill and a release of 5000 barrels of oil a day. The vulnerability of juvenile salmon to spilled oil was used to simply illustrate the concern for fisheries and the associated economic impact. In summary, it was deduced that spills are not improbable, that concentrations of spilled oil can be high, that even small oiled areas could contaminate large numbers of resource species such as young salmon thereby causing major losses, and that oil in water can kill or harm important species. We conclude that there are grounds for serious concern over the risk to fish and fish habitat from the spillage of oil along the coast of British Columbia.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,,0,0,0,,,0706-6457,,,,,,,,,,,"Science Branch, Marine Environment and Habitat Science Division, Freshwater Habitat Section, West Vancouver Laboratory, Fisheries and Oceans Canada, 4160 Marine Drive, West Vancouver, BC, V7V 1N6, Canada",,,,2002-01-01,BCI:BCI200200206303,,

Ten colonies from five branching coral species provided 6,813 fragments (0.5-3 cm height). The fragments, each attached to a plastic pin, were inserted into plastic nets that were tied to a rope-net floating nursery. After 144 nursery days, only 13.1% of the fragments died and 21.2% were detached by mechanical forces. Small colonies ready for transplantation developed within 144-200 days.

Based on a survey of local residents, we first identify current CES in the sea and the intangible values associated with them. Seascape and place emerge as useful conceptual bridges linking ecosystem functioning outcomes to key CES values. We then relate this to offshore wind farming, which some residents perceive as a significant threat to certain CES. Although the approach presented increases the visibility of intangible ecosystem values, the problem remains that such assessments are temporal, in need of added calibration and do not automatically put intangibles on a par with market ecosystem value.

No significant differences in coenosarc tissue growth or survivorship were observed between the species. Measurements after 184 days of growth, found transplant growth to be significantly higher on rhyolite breccia and amorphous coral skeletons than on black 'A'(a) over bar lava. Nevertheless, no significant differences were observed between any of the other substrata. After 365 days of growth, survivorship was also observed to not be significantly different between substrata; with the only exception of being lower on glass substratum.

This is mainly due to the concentration of offshore installations, tanker loading terminals, and the huge volume and density of marine transportation of oil.The operational and accidental oil pollution is a major challenge in the RSA. The impacts of offshore installations of oil and gas particularly those of produced water on the marine environment in general and in shallow waters or near to ecologically sensitive areas in particular are noticeable. The operational pollution from ships and dumping of ballast water are also among the main causes of chronic oil pollution in the Region. At the same time, there are a great number of marine emergency cases resulting in substantial pollution or imminent threat of substantial pollution to the marine environment by oil from collisions, strandings and other incidents involving oil tankers, blow-outs arising from petroleum drilling and production activities, and the presence of oil from the failure of industrial installations. Such marine emergencies as published in the Oil Spill Intelligence Report indicate that 30% of oil spills greater than ten million gallons worldwide are related to the ROPME Region. Another major concern of environmental authorities is the introduction of invasive species that could threaten ecosystems, habitats, and species. To this effect, the establishment of reception facilities for oily wastes and other wastes, and the application of all appropriate measures for the control and management of ships' ballast water and sediments are now on the high priority agenda to be pursued attentively.To address the environmental challenge of oil pollution, a series of program activities for the prevention, abatement, and combating of land-based and sea-based sources of marine oil pollution have been developed and implemented in accordance with the provisions of the Kuwait Regional Convention and its Protocols. Accordingly, marine oil emergency preparedness and response are dealt with by the Emergency Protocol, offshore oil pollution prevention abatement, and control are addressed by the Continental Shelf Protocol, land-based sources of oil pollution are covered by the LBA Protocol, and transportation and disposal of wastes such as ballast water and oily wastes from ships and the establishment of reception facilities are addressed by the Transboundary Protocol. Other areas of focus have been the application of EIA for major development projects, the use of satellite receiving and processing system for monitoring of marine and coastal areas, the oil emergency preparedness and response, and a comprehensive program for training and capacity-building. All these programs are the central objectives of the Kuwait Action Plan (KAP), and have been carefully pursued by way of a coordinated National and Regional process-oriented framework of action.This chapter also describes the institutional arrangements developed for the implementation of the regional instruments. To this effect, liaison has been established and maintained between ROPME and the Contracting States, as well as with the competent regional and international organizations.

These sediment-entraining processes were examined independently to quantify their relative importance on the continental shelf. Using observed grain size data, mobilisation from swell waves occurred on similar to 31% and tidal currents on similar to 41% of the continental shelf. Swell wave energy is sufficient to mobilise fine sand (0.1 mm diameter) to a water depth of 142 m on the Otway Shelf near the western entrance to Bass Strait. Tidal currents in King Sound (northwest shelf) are capable of mobilising large areas of medium sand (0.35 mm diameter) 100% of the time. Superimposing the distribution of threshold exceedance by wave and tidal currents indicates that there are areas on the shelf where either wave-induced or tidal currents dominate, some areas where waves and tides are of relatively equal importance and still other areas where neither is significant. We define six shelf regions of relative wave and tidal energy: zero (no-mobility); waves-only, wave-dominated, mixed, tide-dominated and tides-only. Our results provide a predictive, process-based understanding of the shelf sedimentary system that has applications to marine engineering projects and to regional studies of pollution dispersal and accumulation where significant shelf sediment mobilisation is a factor.
