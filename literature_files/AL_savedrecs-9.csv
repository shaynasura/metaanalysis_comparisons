The models were used to predict the drilling waste zone of influence and the impact of chronic exposure on scallop growth and reproduction. Growth and reproduction are generally considered to be the most important sublethal effects of chronic contaminant exposure. The highest near-bottom concentrations of drilling waste (water-based mud) from a hypothetical 92-day exploration well was predicted to occur along the side of the bank (>100m depth). Laboratory information on drilling mud toxicity threshold concentrations indicated a potential for 0-48 days of growth inhibition depending upon the site, settling velocity of the mud, and area over which results are averaged. Scallop stocks on the side of the bank are relatively sparse, but dense aggregations are found in some areas and it is possible that changes in reproductive output could have detectable effects at the population level. Growth inhibition in the tidal front region, which has the densest scallop stocks, was predicted to be more localised and confined to a range of 0-15 days. Growth loss in the central mixed region (<65m) was predicted to be negligible (<2 days). These results illustrate the importance of site location and waste settling velocity on potential effects. The magnitude of effects predicted at each site was closely related to bottom stress (u(*)) as this determines how rapidly drilling mud reaching the seabed are redistributed and diluted both horizontally and vertically.

R,"Teilmann, Jonas",,,,,,,,,,"Echolocation activity of harbour porpoises, Phocoena phocoena, show seasonal artificial reef attraction despite elevated noise levels close to oil and gas platforms",,,,,,,,Dryad,,,,,,,,,,,,,https://doi.org/10.5061/DRYAD.MSBCC2FW5,,,,,,,Data set,2024-01-17,2020,"Harbour porpoises frequently alter their behaviour in response to underwater sound from shipping, seismic surveys, drilling and marine renewables. Less well understood is the response of porpoises to sounds emitted from oil and gas (O&G) platforms during routine operations. The responses are not easily predictable as platforms can act simultaneously and to varying degree as a source of disturbance through noise and attraction through an artificial reef effect with increased prey abundance and diversity. To investigate the presence and feeding behaviour of harbour porpoises around platforms, autonomous acoustic loggers were placed for up to 2 years, at 21 stations 0-25.6 km from the largest platform in the Danish North Sea. Harbour porpoises were detected at all distances year round in two distinct seasonal activity patterns. During July-January, porpoises were attracted to the platform as indicated by high foraging activity within 800 m of the platform. Echolocation activity levels were up to two-fold higher than that observed at 3.2-9.6 km from the platform. Similar high echolocation activity was observed 200 m from neighbouring offshore installations located within 15 km, during May-July, regardless of their size. This study shows that porpoises may be attracted to offshore O&G platforms despite confirmed elevated underwater noise, and are likely exploiting higher prey abundance in the vicinity of such structures. This is possibly due to increased prey availability created by the combined effect of the artificial reef formed by the underwater structure and the local protected area around all platforms where fishery is banned. Hard substrate and untouched seabed are rare and valuable habitats to many organisms in heavily trawled waters like the North Sea and the ecological importance of these structures should be considered in the development of decommissioning strategies. Study site and experimental design Acoustic monitoring was carried out from July 2013 to July 2015, to record noise levels and harbour porpoise echolocation activity around DanF, located 200 km west of Denmark (Fig. 1). The study area is characterised by sandy sediments and relatively flat bathymetry ranging between 40 and 46 m (Fig. 2, Delefosse et al. 2017). Around all Danish O&G installations, a 500-m fishing exclusion zone is enforced, which corresponds to an area of approximately 1.9 km2 around DanF. To investigate spatial variation in porpoise echolocation activity, 18 acoustic monitoring stations were deployed around DanF at various distances and with replicates along two transects for most distances to avoid data loss (2x0 m, 2x0.2 m, 2x0.4 km, 2x0.8 km, 2x1.6 km, 2x3.2 km, 2x6.4 km, 9.6 km, 12.8 km and 2x25.6 km; Fig. 2). Station locations were chosen to avoid overlap with other O&G installations and minimize variation of environmental factors (e.g. depth). The station located at 12.8 km was placed at Regnar, an inactive subsurface wellhead with dimensions 7.5 m x 6.5 m x 4.5 m that may act as an artificial reef, but does not emit any sound. One station was placed at 25.6 km from DanF as a control stations for the central North Sea (no reef effect and no noise from platforms are present. Note that only six months recording is available, Table S1). At all stations, harbour porpoise presence was monitored using C-PODs (Chelonia Ltd, Penzance, UK); these are calibrated acoustic click detectors (Clausen et al. 2018). Furthermore, five stations (0, 0.2, 0.8, Regnar and 25.6 km away from DanF) were equipped with calibrated broadband loggers (SM2M+ or SM3M+, Wildlife Acoustics, Boston, USA) to record noise emitted from the platform and other sources in the area. All equipment was deployed 2-3 m above the seafloor with the hydrophone pointing upwards to cover the entire acoustic water column. The potential effect on echolocation and noise recordings of instruments being placed near the bottom was considered insignificant (see Supplementary material). To verify findings from DanF and Regnar, C-PODs data deployed at 200 m from three other platforms (HalfdanB, Skjold and Kraka), were available from a different project during May-June 2014 (Fig. 2). Together with DanF and Regnar, the three platforms represent a relatively wide range of sizes, industrial activity, light and sound level typical of O&G installations in the shallow (<100 m) central North Sea (seabed footprint 93-6996 m2, in the following order from small to large: Regnar only subsea, Kraka small and unmanned, Skjold, HalfdanB and DanF large platforms with light and manned, Delefosse et al., 2017). Data analysis - porpoise detections C-POD data were processed with CPOD.exe v2.043. Following Clausen et al. (2018), the click train filter was set to include click trains with a minimum of five clicks and a mean instantaneous frequency between 100 and 160 kHz, avoid transient erroneous clicks from unknown sources to be included. Data were exported as Porpoise Positive Minutes (PPM, i.e. a minute where at least one click train is detected). In addition, all occurrences of click trains with inter-click-intervals (ICI) shorter than 15 ms were extracted. Whilst such short ICIs have been shown to mediate social communication in porpoises (Sorensen et al. 2018), they are more frequently characteristic of echolocation buzzes (74% vs. 26%; Sorensen et al. 2018), which are used during prey pursuits (Verfuss et al. 2009; Wisniewska et al. 2016). We therefore assume that the majority of such click trains are a measure of foraging effort, and they are presented here as Buzzing positive minutes (BPM). Only full recording days (1440 minutes) were considered in spatial and temporal analyses. The instruments were set to stop recording when it reached a maximum value of 4095 clicks per minute to avoid memory overload. Due to this truncation, minutes with more than 4095 clicks were excluded from the analysis, as they were considered saturated and incomplete. Each minute within 24 hours was assigned to either day or night using civil twilight (http://aa.usno. navy.mil). To reduce any potential influence of an unbalanced data design, only C-PODs with data from a minimum of three days within a month were included in the analyses. We initially explored spatial (distance to platforms) and temporal (diel to month-to-month scale) patterns in porpoise echolocation activity using generalized additive mixed models (GAMM, see Supplementary material). Based on these preliminary results, we found two distinct porpoise activity periods and therefore grouped data from February-June and July-January. We then calculated the % PPM for day and night (D/N) conditions at all stations for the two identified periods separately. Percentage of PPM was logit-transformed to fulfil the assumption of normality of residuals (Warton and Hui 2011) and analysed using linear mixed effects models (one model for each period) with the interaction between distance to platform and D/N conditions classed as fixed effects. For all mixed models (here and below), C-POD ID, transect ID, and year were fitted as nested random effects. Temporal dependence among observations was modelled using an autocorrelation structure of order 1 (corCAR1), because this structure provided the best model compared to other correlation structures based on lowest AIC (Pinheiro and Bates 2000). Moreover, for all mixed effects models constructed, any significant differences in the response variable between and within fixed effects groups were estimated using the Bonferroni-corrected Tukey honest significant difference test. We computed the percentage ratio of BPM to PPM (i.e. percentage of time with echolocation clicks that was dedicated to buzzing) for D/N at all stations for the two identified periods separately. To simplify interpretation of the results, stations were grouped as follows: ≤ 800 m from DanF (the platform), 6.4 km from the platform (control), Regnar (12.8 km from platform) and 25.6 km from the platform (control), for this analysis the other distances were excluded to make a simple comparison between platforms vs. control stations. These station groups were, a posteriori, identified as representing reef/platform noise, no reef/ low platform noise, reef/no background noise and no reef/no background noise, respectively. Percentage of BPM/PPM was logit transformed to fulfil the assumption of normality of residuals and analysed using linear mixed effects models (one model for each period) with an interaction between distance and D/N conditions as fixed effects. For inter-platform comparison, we calculated the %PPM for each day of May, June and July 2014 using data recorded at 200m from the five platforms and at a control area (6.4 km from DanF). Percentage of PPM was logit transformed to fulfil the assumption of normality of residuals and analysed using linear mixed effects models with the interaction between month and platform (+control) as a fixed effect. Data analysis - noise The broadband acoustic data were analysed using custom-written routines in Matlab R2015a (Mathworks, Inc., Natick, MA, USA). For ease of processing, the 46-minute-long SM2M+ or SM3M+ sound files were subdivided into sections of 10-second duration that were subsequently averaged over 5 minutes. Prior to averaging, the routines excluded logger artefacts and porpoise clicks from further analysis (Clausen et al, 2018). Up to 10 10-second-long sections per 46-minute file were removed this way. The mammalian auditory system is typically modelled as a filter bank approximated by one-third octave bands (Richardson et al., 1995). Hence, we calculated the received third-octave rms sound pressure levels (TOLs, dB re 1 Pa rms), using a third-octave filter bank implemented in Matlab according to the ANSI standard S1.6-1984 (Christophe Couvreur, Faculte Polytechnique de Mons, Belgium). Occasionally, very brief noise events exceeded the clip level of the broadband recording device, but given the temporal resolution of the data, this should not have affected the average TOL values. Our analysis focused on bands with the highest noise levels (centred at 315 Hz, 5.0 and 31.5 kHz), and on a subset of bands highlighted in the EUs Marine Strategy Framework Directive (centred at 63, 125 and 2,000 Hz). For each frequency band, we tested for differences in ambient noise levels (mean TOL over 5 minutes) as a function of distance to the platform, taking into account both D/N conditions and the two porpoise activity periods identified with the GAMMs. To do so, we fitted linear mixed effects models with the 3-way interaction between distance to platform, D/N condition and porpoise activity period as a fixed effect.

The survival rate of two-year-old juveniles on artificial reefs reached 85%. Monitoring studies of the bottom sites showed that for the entire period of functioning of the farm, 8 years, a sea cucumber colony with the average distribution density of 1.5 inds/m(2) was formed on an area of about 30 ha. The harvest of the commercial production of sea cucumbers purchased at hatcheries can be calculated taking the survival rates of juveniles during the first years of their life into account.

Among the several services that these areas provide, the capacity of sequestering (capturing and storing) organic carbon is a regulating service, provided mainly by mangroves and seagrasses, that gains importance as alternatives for mitigating global warming become a priority in the international agenda. The objective of this study is to value the services associated with the capture and storage of oceanic carbon, known as Blue Carbon, provided by a new network of marine protected areas in Colombia. We approach the monetary value associated to these services through the simulation of a hypothetical market for oceanic carbon. To do that, we construct a benefit function that considers the capacity of mangroves and seagrasses for capturing and storing blue carbon, and simulate scenarios for the variation of key variables such as the market carbon price, the discount rate, the natural rate of loss of the ecosystems, and the expectations about the post-Kyoto negotiations. The results indicate that the expected benefits associated to carbon capture and storage provided by these ecosystems are substantial but highly dependent on the expectations in terms of the negotiations surrounding the extension of the Kyoto Protocol and the dynamics of the carbon credit's demand and supply. We also find that the natural loss rate of these ecosystems does not seem to have a significant effect on the annual value of the benefits.

In Mdumbi site, two areas were identified while four areas were identified in Mngazi site based on hydrogeomorphic units (HGM). A WET-Eco Services Tool was used to assess goods and services in each wetland site. Questionnaires were also used to solicit the perceptions of communities on wetland impacts. Results revealed that the wetland systems in the lower reaches of Mngazi and Mdumbi Rivers do render a series of services varying from one system to another depending on the size and type of hydrogeomorphic unit. High confidence rating was revealed in provision of natural resources and erosion control in all the wetlands of each site while moderate confidence rating was revealed for provision of erosion control, phosphate trapping, toxicant removal and nitrate removal. Low confidence rating was observed by carbon storage, cultural significance, education, tourism and recreation.

Currently, carbon is of particular interest as policies for increasing carbon storage on federal lands are being proposed. However, a challenge in joint production analysis of forest management is adequately representing ecological conditions and processes that influence joint production relationships. We used simulation models of vegetation structure, forest sector carbon, and potential wildlife habitat to characterize landscape-level joint production possibilities for carbon storage, timber harvest, and habitat for seven wildlife species across a range of forest management regimes. We sought to (1) characterize the general relationships of production possibilities for combinations of carbon storage, timber, and habitat, and (2) identify management variables that most influence joint production relationships. Our 160 000-ha study landscape featured environmental conditions typical of forests in the Western Cascade Mountains of Oregon (USA). Our results indicate that managing forests for carbon storage involves trade-offs among timber harvest and habitat for focal wildlife species, depending on the disturbance interval and utilization intensity followed. Joint production possibilities for wildlife species varied in shape, ranging from competitive to complementary to compound, reflecting niche breadth and habitat component needs of species examined. Managing Pacific Northwest forests to store forest sector carbon can be roughly complementary with habitat for Northern Spotted Owl, Olive-sided Flycatcher, and red tree vole. However, managing forests to increase carbon storage potentially can be competitive with timber production and habitat for Pacific marten, Pileated Woodpecker, and Western Bluebird, depending on the disturbance interval and harvest intensity chosen. Our analysis suggests that joint production possibilities under forest management regimes currently typical on industrial forest lands (e.g., 40- to 80-yr rotations with some tree retention for wildlife) represent but a small fraction of joint production outcomes possible in the region. Although the theoretical boundaries of the production possibilities sets we developed are probably unachievable in the current management environment, they arguably define the long-term potential of managing forests to produce multiple ecosystem services within and across multiple forest ownerships.",,,,,,,,,33,2,0,0,21,0,40,,,1051-0761,1939-5582,,,,,,,,,,"US Forest Serv, USDA, Pacific Northwest Res Stn, 3200 SW Jefferson Way, Corvallis, OR 97331 USAOregon State Univ, Forest Ecosyst & Soc, 321 Richardson Hall, Corvallis, OR 97331 USAUniv Connecticut, Dept Nat Resources & Environm, 1376 Storrs Rd, Storrs, CT 06269 USAOregon State Univ, Dept Fisheries & Wildlife, 104 Nash Hall, Corvallis, OR 97331 USAOregon State Univ, Inst Nat Resources, POB 751, Portland, OR 97331 USAUS Forest Serv, Lab Applicat Remote Sensing Ecol, USDA, 3200 SW Jefferson Way, Corvallis, OR 97331 USAOregon State Univ, 3200 SW Jefferson Way, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA",,,,2016-10-01,WOS:000385623900007,27755743,

Because there are several options for further demonstration and initial deployment projects to build on this initial effort, the UK Government will need to decide its priorities for CCS deployment. Regardless of the route, a successful transition to widespread use of CCS would have to overcome significant technical, commercial, regulatory; and political challenges. This article considers the significance of understanding and using lessons learned from previous major UK energy sector transitions to manage the development, demonstration, and deployment of CCS. The past transitions considered here are not perfect analogies, but they do suggest a range of potential futures for CCS deployment in the UK.

Sixty to seventy percent of carbon dioxide emissions originate from fossil fuel power plants. Power companies in the UK, along with oil and gas field operators, are proposing to capture this anthropogenic CO2 and either store it in depleted reservoirs or saline aquifers (carbon capture and storage, CCS), or use it for 'Enhanced Oil Recovery' (EOR) in depleting oil and gas fields. This would involve extensive onshore and offshore pipeline systems. The decline of oil and gas production of reservoirs beyond economic feasibility will require the decommissioning onshore and offshore facilities post-production. This creates a possible opportunity for using existing pipeline infrastructure. Conversions of pipelines from natural gas service to CO2 service for EOR have been done in the United States. However, the differing sources of CO2 and the differing requirements for EOR and CCS play a significant part in allowing the re-use of existing infrastructure. The effect of compositions, the phase of transportation, the original pipeline specifications, and also the pipeline route require major studies prior to allowing re-use.This paper will first review the requirements for specifying the purity of the CO2 for CCS and to highlight the implications that the presence of impurities and the current water specifications for pipelines has on the phase diagram and the associated physical properties of the CO2 stream. A 'best' and 'worst' case impurity specification will be identified. Then an analysis on the impact and subsequent validation, of equations of state based on available experimental data on the phase modelling of anthropogenic CO2 is presented.A case study involving an existing 300km gas pipeline in the National Transmission System (NTS) in the UK is then modelled, to demonstrate the feasibility of using this pipeline to transport anthropogenic CO2. The various issues involved for the selected 'best' and 'worst' case specification are also covered.

The oil spill decreased sediment chlorophyll a concentrations, altered benthic macrofaunal community, and affected ecological functioning by suppressing or even stopping microalgal production, increasing bacterial respiration, and causing a shift from an autotrophic system to a heterotrophic system. Effects of the oil spill on the macrofauna were more severe than on benthic microalgae, and affected sedentary infauna more than motile epifauna. Despite the oil spill's impact on the benthic community and carbon metabolism, the affected area appeared to return to normal in about 23 days. Our results suggest that the prompt response of benthic metabolism to exposure to petroleum hydrocarbons can serve as a useful indicator of the impact of an oil spill. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Sixty-eight percent of the discovered reserves are from the Tethys domain, while 49% of the undiscovered possible reserves are in passive margin basins. Six major sets of source rocks, two types of reservoirs (carbonates and clastics), and two regional seals (shale and evaporite) formed in global evolution of basins. Ten patterns are summarized from the above factors controlling the distribution of global hydrocarbon resources. (1) Conventional-unconventional hydrocarbon is accumulated orderly. (2) Distribution of Tethys controls the accumulation of the global hydrocarbons. (3) Foreland thrusting zones control the distribution of structural oil/gas fields; (4) Intra-craton uplifts control the distribution of giant oil/gas fields; (5) Platform margins control the banded distribution of giant organic reef and bank type oil/gas fields. (6) Passive margins control the distribution of giant marine oil/gas fields. (7) Foreland deep slopes control the occurrence of large scale heavy oil and bitumen. (8) Basin deposition slopes control the accumulation of tight oil & gas and coalbed methane. (9) Organic rich deep basin sediments control the retention of shale oil and gas. (10) Low temperature and high pressure seafloor sediments control the distribution of hydrate. The conventional/unconventional resources ratio is 2:8. The conventional resources are mainly distributed in the Middle East, Russia, North America, and Latin America. The unconventional resources are mainly distributed in North America, Asia Pacific, Latin America, and Russia. According to the ten trends of global petroleum industry, hydrocarbon exploration is mainly focused on marine deep water, onshore deep layer, and unconventional oil & gas.

An improved integrated model for risk assessment is suggested as a tool based on the rapid responses of bacterial community.

Final report.",,,,,,,,Bishop Museum Technical Report,,,,25,,,,i,"vi, 1-245",,,,,,,,,,,Article,October 2002,2002,"Surveys of the marine algae, invertebrates and reef fishes of Waikiki and the Kuapa Pond and Maunalua Bay areas of Hawai'i Kai were conducted with the objective of the presence and impact of nonindigenous (introduced) marine organisms. Findings were compared with historical records of species reported in these locations and with the results of similar studies conducted in Hawai'i and the Pacific. Observations and collections were made at 15 stations at Waikiki in January 2001 and at five stations in Kuapa Pond-Maunalua Bay in February 2002 at 5 stations. A comprehensive literature review of published papers and books and unpublished reports was conducted to develop listings of previous species reports, and the marine invertebrates, fish, mollusk and algae collections at Bishop Museum were queried for information regarding all organisms that had been collected from these areas. The assembled data were developed into a relational data bases used to determine the percent component of the total biota that is nonindigenous or cryptogenic, the number of new reports versus the number of previous reports not found, and a chronology of first reports of introductions. A total of 925 taxa including 749 species were observed or collected in Waikiki, and 384 taxa including 317 species at Kuapa Pond-Maunalua Bay. Of these 52 species designated introduced or cryptogenic (collectively termed NIS) were identified at Waikiki, for an NIS component of 6.9% of the total species identified for the 15 stations. By comparison 58 NIS were observed or collected at Kuapa Pond-Maunalua Bay amounting to an NIS component of total species of 18%. Forty-six of the 52 NIS were new reports for Waikiki, and 56 of the 58 NIS new for Kuapa Pond- Maunalua Bay sites. However, all but three species, hydroids collected from Waikiki designated cryptogenic, were previously reported elsewhere in Hawai'i, with first reports mostly in Pearl Harbor, Honolulu Harbor or Kane'ohe Bay. The high incidence of first reports for Waikiki and the Hawai'i Kai area in this study are clearly effort related, since these were the first comprehensive sampling efforts that have been conducted at these locations. At Waikiki there was little indication of differences in spatial distributions among the 15 stations for the total identified biota, major taxonomic groups of invertebrate or fish species in any or total NIS. However total algal species and algal NIS showed a clear association nearshore stations, especially in the vicinity of the beachfront from the Waikiki Aquarium to San Souci, where the invasive nonindigenous algae Acanthophora spicifera, Gracilaria salicornia and Hypnea musciformis cover the reef flat and dominate the biota. This area is the most environmentally disturbed at Waikiki, but overall the benthic environment is highly degraded from the coral reef community that was described early in the 20th century, with few reef corals remaining in very abundance. Overall, the Waikiki reef has been highly impacted from continual deposition of beach sand along the shoreline that has moved offshore and buried or otherwise impacted reef surfaces, resulting in a mostly sand covered bottom that was dominated by a widespread coverage of the brown alga Dictyopteris australis at the time of our survey. Regarding non-algal NIS that are considered invasive, the mostly widely occurring invertebrate was the stomatopod Gonodactylaceus falcatus, which occurred in low abundance at five stations and the most prominent was the octocoral Carijoa riisei, which covers the interior surfaces of the shipwreck that was placed offshore in 30 m depth as a viewing site for the tourist submarine Atlantis. The invasive fish Lutjanus kasmira is also abundant at this site, and a single invasive grouper Cephalopholis argus was sighted at one other station. In contrast to the relatively low proportion of the total biota composed of NIS that was found at Waikiki, the 18% overall value determined for Kuapa Pond-Maunalua Bay is equivalent to what has been found for harbors and the semi-enclosed Kane'ohe Bay elsewhere on O'ahu. However when the distribution of total fauna and NIS are examined in terms of location and environmental characteristics, the results correspond to the a previously determined pattern of high incidence of nonindigenous species in harbors or enclosed areas compared to open water reef environments. The two stations in or adjacent to Kuapa Pond showed relatively low numbers of total species and high numbers of NIS, resulting in a NIS component of 40% at the Kuapa site, the highest value that has been determined in Hawai'i. By contrast, the single coral reef station sampled in Maunalua Bay showed an NIS component of only 4%. Nearshore sites in Maunalua Bay showed intermediate NIS component values of 14-17%, and these were the locations dominated by themost widespread invasive nonindigenous species in the area, the algae Avrainvillea amaldepha. The other notable invasive species was the octocoral Carijoa riisei, which monopolizes the surfaces of bridge pilings and other hard surfaces under the bridge that covers the outlet for Kuapa Pond Marina 1, the original outflow for the Kuapa Pond system. The study results are consistent with previous findings by studies in both tropical and temperate marine systems and in temperate terrestrial communities that have indicated reduced invasion success in communities with greater species richness. This suggests that, along with measures to prevent or inhibit new introductions of nonindigenous marine species, a primary management tool for limiting the proliferation and impact of these introductions is implement measures that continue or restore high diversity marine communities.",,,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,,,1085-455X,,,,,,,,,,,"Bernice Pauahi Bishop Museum, Hawaii Biological Survey, USA",,,,2002-10-01,ZOOREC:ZOOR14110062012,,

This phenomenon is referred to as ocean acidification (OA) and is predicted to become particularly acute in coastal regions, including the west coast of the US. As the oceans become more acidic, it will become increasingly difficult for marine calcifiers to produce their shells. This may have important consequences for the marine food web and for various commercially important marine species. This study will produce the first detailed record of changes in OA along the coast of California during the last two centuries. This will be accomplished by examining the shells of a group of calcifying plankton called foraminifera. These organisms live and produce their shells at the sea surface, with the shells sinking to the sea floor when the organism dies. Foraminiferal shells from a sediment core collected from Santa Barbara Basin will be studied in order to reconstruct changes in calcification over the last 200 years. Using these results, predictions will be made as to how calcification will continue to change through the end of the 21st century based on various scenarios for increasing atmospheric CO2. Modeling studies suggest that the California Current System (CCS) and associated ecosystem have been and will continue to be particularly vulnerable to ocean acidification (OA). To test this concept, this study will quantify the effect of OA on calcification rates in planktonic foraminifera from the Santa Barbara Basin region of the CCS since the onset of the Industrial Revolution. A 20-year Santa Barbara Basin sediment trap time series, together with the varved sediments from the basin will be used to generate a nearly annually resolved record of changes in calcification for this group of plankton in the CCS for the last 200 years. The proposed research will take place in two phases. First, sediment trap samples and coincident water column chemistry data will be used to calibrate the relationships among foraminiferal shell morphology (area density), shell geochemistry (B/Ca), and water column carbonate chemistry. Second, these morphologic and trace metal proxies will be used to produce two independent records of changing carbon ion concentration for the last two centuries using a 210Pb-dated varved sediment record. These sediment-derived estimates of carbon ion concentration will be compared with model estimates of this parameter for the last two centuries. Taken together, the sediment trap and core samples will provide an incomparable archive for quantifying the impact of OA on calcification in this paleoclimatically important group of plankton.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,1631977,,,,,,,,University of South Carolina at Columbia,,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:13567463,,

Counts of seals by aerial transect showed a sharp decline in May, prior to pupping and the first ships arriving; counts rebounded by the end of June remaining high until August. Seal distribution and abundance peaked in 5-7 tenths ice cover; total area of ice cover showed no effect. Despite regular flushing of seals by ships, we found no broad-scale patterns in seal abundance and distribution that could be explained by ship presence. We cannot rule out mechanisms of long-term disturbance, difficult to detect and that might explain notable differences with other, similar sites.

The authors of this publication have characterized and described the factors limiting the occurrence of coral reefs, including: water temperature, salinity, access to sunlight, contamination, physicochemical and hydromechanical parameters of water. Moreover anthropogenic threats to coral reefs have been specified, including diving tourism, ecological disasters (e.g. oil spills) and the development of marine aquaristics. Rapid changes in the basic living conditions are dangerous for corals and their symbionts and may cause the unsuitability of the new environment resulting in diseases such as coral bleaching. Corals bleaching is a disease associated with the break of the coral and algae relationship which results in a coral reef death on a global scale. Awareness of these negative factors, often related to human activity, may allow us to better understand the ecological processes that are the basis of reef functioning and might enable us to prevent and oppose to the changes and ecological recessions of coral reefs.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,0025-8628,,,,,,,,,,,"Uniwersytet Przyrodniczy, Wydzial Biol Nauk Zwierzetach & Biogospodarki, Inst Biol Podstaw Prod Zwierzecej, Zaklad Biol Srodowiskowej & Apidol, Ul Akad 13, PL-20950 Lublin, Poland",Uniwersytet Przyrodniczy,,,2019-04-01,WOS:000461829300005,,

This paper builds on a whole system dynamic CCS optimisation tool developed at Imperial College and presents a mixed integer linear programming approach for multi-stage multi-scenario stochastic optimisation of a spatially explicit integrated CCS system under uncertainty. The model provides great advantages through flexible strategies for all potential system state changes at every stage and early one-fit-for-all investment solutions that minimise financial loss and offer operational flexibility. The model is showcased through a case study set in the UK between 2015-2050 focusing on the techno-economic performance of the CCS value chain and considering uncertainties in the financial market and the storage capacity within a portfolio of Southern North Sea saline aquifer and depleted oil and gas fields.

Fish (n = 755) belonging to five successive year-classes (1996-2000) were sampled from three GOM regions. Solution-based analysis of otolith chemistry was accomplished with sector field-inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (Ba, Mg, Mn, and Sr) and inductively coupled plasma-optical emissions spectrometry (Ca). Several regional trends observed for individual elements were consistent among year-classes, yet elemental signatures were significantly different among years as well as among regions (multivariate analysis of variance [MANOVA]; p < 0.001). Jackknifed classification accuracies from linear discriminant function analysis approached 80% (mean = 78.4%) in all years except 1998 (62.4%). Overall, these results indicate otolith elemental signatures may serve as effective region-specific natural tags of GOM red snapper. Significant differences in otolith chemistry among year-classes indicates year-class-specific analysis is required to derive natural tags.

The Marsh Equilibrium Model (MEM), a one-dimensional mechanistic elevation model, incorporates feedbacks of organic and inorganic inputs to project elevations under sea-level rise scenarios. We tested the feasibility of deriving two key MEM inputs-average annual suspended sediment concentration (SSC) and aboveground peak biomass-from remote sensing data in order to apply MEM across a broader geographic region. We analyzed the precision and representativeness (spatial distribution) of these remote sensing inputs to improve understanding of our study region, a brackish tidal marsh in San Francisco Bay, and to test the applicable spatial extent for coastal modeling. We compared biomass and SSC models derived from Landsat 8, DigitalGlobe WorldView-2, and hyperspectral airborne imagery. Landsat 8-derived inputs were evaluated in a MEM sensitivity analysis. Biomass models were comparable although peak biomass from Landsat 8 best matched field-measured values. The Portable Remote Imaging Spectrometer SSC model was most accurate, although a Landsat 8 time series provided annual average SSC estimates. Landsat 8-measured peak biomass values were randomly distributed, and annual average SSC (30 mg/L) was well represented in the main channels (IQR: 29-32 mg/L), illustrating the suitability of these inputs across the model domain. Trend response surface analysis identified significant diversion between field and remote sensing-based model runs at 60 yr due to model sensitivity at the marsh edge (80-140 cm NAVD88), although at 100 yr, elevation forecasts differed less than 10 cm across 97% of the marsh surface (150-200 cm NAVD88). Results demonstrate the utility of Landsat 8 for landscape-scale tidal marsh elevation projections due to its comparable performance with the other sensors, temporal frequency, and cost. Integration of remote sensing data with MEM should advance regional projections of marsh vegetation change by better parameterizing MEM inputs spatially.

Learning from Nature or biomimicry can be a powerful tool in designing, developing and accessing the next generation of synthetic materials and systems. Furthermore, biomimetic concepts will account for an estimated $1.2 trillion in global economic development, and have already contributed to familiar products like Velcro and wind turbines. Thus, there is a critical need for the US to educate the next generation of internationally-minded biomimicry thinkers to develop a new wave of innovative materials. As such, this PIRE brings together an interdisciplinary team of US and Swiss collaborators to carry out research and education in the area of Bio-Inspired Materials & Systems. Specifically, the PIRE will utilize inspiration from Nature to design new materials that can change toughness in response to their environment, are safer and more effective biological implants, will transmit nerve-like electrical signals, and can respond to the environment to initiate biological processes, all for use in soft robotic applications. A range of innovative educational and outreach activities will train US students in learning from Nature and in a bio-inspired philosophy. This training will happen in an international context with Swiss collaborators, world leaders in biomimetic concepts and research. Students will gain exposure to themes cutting across chemistry, polymers, physics, biology, and engineering in the development of multi-functional, active materials. Mentoring, diversity, cultural competency, globalization, and effective scientific communication are emphasized as critical elements of the PIRE. Nature has a multitude of examples of complex materials and systems that go well beyond the current capabilities of synthetic systems. The innovation potential in this domain is vast and a large-scale interdisciplinary effort is required to realize paradigm-changing scientific breakthroughs. To that end, an international partnership between biomimicry experts at Case Western Reserve University (CWRU), the University of Chicago (UoC), and the University of Fribourg/Adolphe Merkle Institute in Switzerland in Bio-inspired Materials and Systems is established. Building upon collaborative strengths in polymer synthesis, computational modeling, mechanical characterization, robotics, imaging, manufacturing, biology, biomedical engineering, physics, and molecular engineering, five Bio-inspired Materials and Systems projects are envisioned: (1) Silk-inspired Nanocomposites: Spider/Caddisfly Silk Mimics; (2) Sea Cucumber, Squid Beak and Pine Cone Inspired Adaptive Composites; (3) Excitable Polyelectrolyte Fiber Networks/Gels: Toward Artificial Neurons; (4) Dynamic and Functional Fibers Inspired by the Extracellular Matrix; and (5) Soft Robotics Inspired by Worm Locomotion. These research thrusts are directed toward the development of functional, programmable, and responsive materials for deployment in soft robotic systems. Faculty, graduate, and undergraduate students will spend time in Switzerland engaging in synergistic research/educational activities. An educational and innovation partnership with local thought leaders in biomimicry will guide the training of the next-generation of global scientists and engineers in this interdisciplinary endeavor. Effective science communication will be highlighted via existing programming with the Museum of Science and Industry (MSI) of Chicago. Community outreach activities include research opportunities at CWRU and UoC for underrepresented high school students in STEM as part of an expanded Biomimetic Envoys program and the development of biomimetic hands-on demonstrations for annual participation in the Martin Luther King Jr. (MLK) Discovery Day at the Cleveland Museum of Natural History.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,1743475,,,,,,,,,,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:13620056,,

Individuals interested in developing sustainable offshore aquaculture face challenges in the form of a fragmented and often inconsistent permitting process among the federal, state, and local agencies and questions regarding leasing, siting, and property rights. The lack of adequate leasing options restricts the feasibility of moving pens offshore. One avenue to sustainable offshore aquaculture is the consolidation of specific sites for aquaculture leases into Marine Aquaculture Zones (MAZs). Zoning has been a useful land-based tool in the United States to set aside particular areas appropriate for industry development. The creation of MAZs require: a) the designation of one federal agency responsible for the management of the zones; b) issuance of leases of the water column and sea-bed in the zones; and, c) issuance of a permit that would incorporate the concerns of other relevant federal and state agencies. Marine zoning faces significant challenges that its land-based counterpart does not, such as boundary disputes, enforcement difficulties, and more frequent user conflicts. Coastal and offshore waters represent a public resource for use by fishers, recreationalists, mineral exploiters, and the shipping industry. Despite significant policy conflicts, coastal managers across the globe are recognizing the importance of setting aside particular areas of marine waters for specific uses. These include marine sanctuaries; areas used as military zones; specific lease areas for offshore oil and gas exploration; and, state and federal marine reserves or marine protected areas to conserve fish and other marine resources. These designations, along with international zoning efforts, offer elements to create a marine zone model dedicated to aquaculture.",,,,,Symposium Open Ocean Aquaculture IV on From Research to Commercial RealitySymposium Open Ocean Aquaculture IV on From Research to Commercial Reality,"JUN 17-20, 2001JUN 17-20, 2001",,"St Andrews, CANADASt Andrews, CANADA",2,0,0,0,1,0,2,,,,,1-888807-13-X,,,,,,,,,"Univ Mississippi, Mississippi Alabama Sea Grant Legal Program, Law Ctr 518, University, MS 38677 USA",,,,2003-01-01,WOS:000228582300002,,

Such research is useful for assessing the context and limits of future deepwater oil and gas development in the Gulf of Mexico. The Deepwater Horizon incident in the Gulf represents the first oil spill occurring at significant depth, similar to 5,000 ft (1,500 m). It is also the first situation where dispersants were directly added to the hydrocarbon effluent from the wellhead in efforts to disperse the droplets over a large volume of the water column. In this regard, this perspective is an original work in that it provides an in-depth analysis of gaps and needs, which will guide future work in the field. Preliminary reports have led to a variety of images that highlight new physiochemical phenomena whose comprehensive understanding will be needed in assessing the oil and associated hydrocarbon chemical fate and environmental impact. Camera images of the oil and gas entering the water at depth and subsurface remote-operated vehicles have revealed droplet clouds and hydrocarbon plumes suspended thousands of feet below the surface moving horizontally with the water currents. Although preliminary, these and other observations are sufficient to piece together new hypothetical deepwater chemodynamic processes and phenomena that have yet to be fully understood. This position article focuses on unique and new research issues raised and relevant to this spill specifically. The ultimate fate of the oil constituents is a very broad subject.

On land, the majority of the sequestered carbon enters soil carbon stores. Almost one-third of that soil carbon can be found in peatlands, an area covering just 2-3% of the Earth's landmass. Peatlands are thus well established as powerful agents of carbon capture and storage; the preservation of archaeological artefacts, such as ancient bog bodies, further attest to their exceptional preservative properties. Peatlands have higher carbon storage densities per unit ecosystem area than either the oceans or dry terrestrial systems. However, despite attempts over a number of years at enhancing carbon capture in the oceans or in land-based afforestation schemes, no attempt has yet been made to optimize peatland carbon storage capacity or even to harness peatlands to store externally captured carbon. Recent studies suggest that peatland carbon sequestration is due to the inhibitory effects of phenolic compounds that create an 'enzymic latch' on decomposition.

The present study reveals the temporal variations in the abundance of the reef-inhabiting fishes in the different estuarine locations (oyster beds, mangroves and bridge). A total of 184 individuals of lionfish were captured from the three locations during April-September 2011. Different size groups were caught (total length 6.8-17.8 cm) throughout the sampling period and captured individuals were more (n = 164) near the mangroves and oyster beds, than those (n = 20) found near the man-made structure (bridge). Percentage capture of lionfish was higher during August. Other reef-associated fishes were also recorded and the family Acanthuridae (n = 51) was dominant and the remaining taxa were less abundant. Twelve prey taxa were identified through gut content analysis of lionfish that includes penaeids, non-penaeids and teleosts. The dominant taxa were found to be the shrimps, indicating the colonization of lionfish in newer but natural habitat as feeding ground.

Kinetic energy associated with diurnal tidal frequencies is largest at the shelf break and decreases rapidly with distance from it. The diurnal tidal energy increases from austral winter to summer by, on average, 50 %. The austral summer enhancement is observed in all deployments. The observations are compared to results from an idealised numerical solution of the properties of coastal trapped waves (CTWs) for a given bathymetry, stratification and an along-slope current. The frequency at which the dispersion curve for mode 1 CTWs displays a maximum (i.e. where the group velocity is zero and resonance is possible) is found within or near the diurnal frequency band, and it is sensitive to the stratification in the upper part of the water column and to the background current. The maximum of the dispersion curve is shifted towards higher frequencies, above the diurnal band, for weak stratification and a strong background current (i.e. austral winter-like conditions) and towards lower frequencies for strong upper-layer stratification and a weak background current (austral summer). The seasonal evolution of hydrography and currents in the region is inferred from available mooring data and conductivity-temperature-depth profiles.

They provide important ecosystem services, including transportation and remineralization of nutrients, habitat for coastal biota, coastal bioshield, biofilters and recreation and cultural benefits. In India, 15 salt marsh species so far have been reported, spread over 1600 km(2). Salt marshes are known to adapt themselves to the changing environmental conditions fairly quickly by maintaining a balance between the existing pressures and the prevailing state. Thus, they tend to retain a long-term ecosystem sustainability under changing environmental conditions. Recent studies have recognized them for their extraordinary capacity of carbon sequestration, which gives them edge amongst the coastal ecosystems, but the carbon stock is comparatively low due to their alarming decline in global areal extent.In the Indian context, salt marshes occupy a significant share of the coastline along with the other blue carbon ecosystems like mangroves and seagrasses. This provides India with a very promising alternative for achieving its Intended Nationally Determined Contribution towards climate change mitigation through enhancing additional carbon sinks (INDC goal # 5). But, despite its rich salt marsh diversity and distribution along the entire coastline, Indian salt marshes are one of the most overlooked coastal ecosystems. The documented studies on the Indian marshes are relatively scarce and studies addressing their carbon storage and climate change mitigation potential are totally non-existent. There is an urgent need for targeted scientific studies to be taken up on the Indian salt marsh ecosystems to develop a holistic and updated database, which can support resource management, decisionmaking and facilitate to estimate Blue carbon economy of India.",,,,,,,,,11,0,0,0,7,0,12,,,2395-7611,2395-7697,,,,,,,,,,"NCSCM, Anna Univ Campus, Chennai 600025, Tamil Nadu, India",,,,2018-12-28,WOS:000414072900006,,

Overall, approximately 27,000 km of ocean habitat were surveyed, averaging 1600 km per cruise. We identified mesoscale features (eddy centers and the core of the California Current), based on dynamic height anomalies, and considered habitat associations for seven migratory seabird species: black-footed albatross (Phoebastria nigripes), Cook's petrel (Pterodroma cookii), Leach's storm-petrel (Oceanodroma leucorhoa), dark shearwaters (mainly sooty shearwater Puffinus griseus, with a few short-tailed shearwaters Puffinus tenuirostris), northern fulmar (Fulmarus glacialis), red phalarope (Phalaropus fulicaria), and red-necked phalarope (Phalaropus lobatus). We explored associations (presence/absence and density relationships) of marine birds with mesoscale features (eddies, current jet) and metrics of primary productivity (chlorophyll a and nitrate concentrations). Mesoscale eddies were consistently identified in the study region, but were spatially and temporally variable. The resolved eddies were large-scale features associated with meanders of the equatorward-flowing California Current. Cook's petrel was found offshore with no specific habitat affinities. Black-footed albatross, red phalarope, and Leach's storm petrel were found in association with offshore eddies and/or the core of the California Current, but the functional relationship for these species varied, possibly reflecting differences in flight capabilities. The more coastal species, including the shearwaters, fulmar, and red-necked phalarope, were positively associated with proxies of primary productivity. Of the hydrographic habitats considered, the upwelling region of Point Conception appears to be an important hotspot of sustained primary production and marine bird concentrations. Point Conception and other similar coastal locations (upwelling cells) may warrant protection as key foraging grounds for seabirds. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

The plateaus are bounded by ledges (chinoks). Against the background of the gentle hilly topography, one can observe smaller but sufficiently long (tens of kilometers) groups of arc-shaped parallel limestone ridges (2-8 in high) that crosscut large morphological irregularities. All topographic forms on the plateau resulted from a prolonged (many millions years) weathering and and denudation. Therefore, insignificant differences of stability appeared in limestones armoring the plateau. Analysis of the composition and structure of limestones in linear arc-shaped ridges of ledges and the plateau surface showed that the limestones represent an extremely shallow-water facies of shelf sediments. The arc-shaped limestone ridges on the plateau are exposed, partially modified, accumulative, and biogenic-accumulative forms of bottom relief. Similar accumulative forms coupled with biogenic buildups are known in nontropic carbonate shelves of recent seas. The finding of coastal-marine forms on the limestone plateau surface suggests a shallow-water sedimentation regime in Neogene basins persisting over short time spans. Study of such forms is of interest for the refinement of water depths, wave-wind regime, and currents in Neogene basins, as well as for prospecting for oil-gas fields and placer accumulations.",,,,,,,,,2,0,0,0,0,0,2,,,0024-4902,,,,,,,,,,,"Russian Acad Sci, Schmidt Joint Inst Phys Earth, Moscow 123810, RussiaPerm State Univ, Dept Reg Geol, Perm 614600, Russia",,,,2003-05-01,WOS:000185184700006,,

This well sank to the total subbottom depth of 2100 m penetrated sediments ranging back to Lake Cretaceous in age. The upper 500 m of well sequence which comprises largely Quaternary sediments was subjected to paleoenvironmental analyses by jointly analyzing microfossils (calcareous nannoplankton and benthic and planktonic foraminifera), mineral content, and oxygen and carbon isotope stratigraphies. Three dated horizons, 0.128, 0.27 and 0.46 Ma, were established by recognizing one marked excursion to negative values in the oxygen isotope record and two calcareous nannoplankton datum levels in the well sequence. A possible hiatus at about 465 m depth terminates this mid-Quaternary sequence which is underlain by late Pliocene strata of about 1.9 Ma and older. Mid-Quaternary paleobathymetric trends were reconstructed for the well site area mainly on the basis of Q-mode cluster analysis of benthic foraminiferal faunas. Deposition of the mid-Quaternary sequence began in the upper bathyal zone and a steady shallowing followed through outer shelf environments to the present-day inner neritic zone. Other paleo-depth indicators such as abundance variations of nannoplankton Florisphaera profunda and planktonic versus total foraminifera ratios, and variations of 13C isotope record are all supportive of this benthic foraminifera-based depth-trend. Paleotemperature fluctuations were estimated by analyzing oxygen isotope compositions of benthic and planktonic foraminifera and by calculating with the aid of paleoecological transfer functions quantitative estimates of past winter temperatures. The paleotemperature fluctuations estimated for the well site area by these two methods agree well for the lower part of the well sequence, but begin to diverge from the mid-sequence and upwards, probably reflecting increasing effects of local water masses to the oxygen isotope variation. In the Quaternary isotope record of Kashima SK-1 well, no definite interval correlatable with the even-numbered isotope stages was observed. In view of the fact that distinct hiatuses occur in the onshore Quaternary record of Kanto District located to the west of the well site, the lack of even-numbered isotope stages is interpreted to signify periods of greatly reduced sedimentation or possibly non-deposition in a broad coastal region encompassing also the continental shelf around the well site. Mid-Quaternary paleoceanography around the well site prior to about 0.35 Ma was under the general influence of cold Oyashio Current with its strength varying greatly from time to time, whereas the latter time period responding to the diminishing Oyashio Current saw a seesaw game of two warm currents, Kuroshio and Tsugaru, expanding and retreating alternatively over a broad region of the sea off Northeast Honshu, Japan.",,,,,,,,,1,0,0,,1,0,1,,,0082-464X,,,,,,,,,,,"INST GEOLOGY AND PALEONTOLOGY, TOHOKU UNIV, JAPAN",,,,1987-01-01,BCI:BCI198885109579,,

Through assessment of Acorn's publicly available outputs, we identify strategies which may help to enhance the viability of early-stage CCS projects. Initial capital costs can be minimised by infrastructure re-use, particularly pipelines, and by reuse of data describing the subsurface acquired during oil and gas exploration activity. Also, development of the project in separate stages of activity (e.g. different phases of infrastructure reuse and investment into new infrastructure) enables cost reduction for future build-out phases. Additionally, engagement of regional-level policy makers may help to build stakeholder support by situating CCS within regional decarbonisation narratives. We argue that these insights may be translated to general objectives for any CCS project sharing similar characteristics such as legacy infrastructure, industrial clusters and an involved stakeholder-base that is engaged with the fossil fuel industry.

Community composition varied significantly over time and between treatments with some high variability within contaminated treatments suggesting community stress. Both lubricants showed evidence of significant effects on community composition after 5 years even though total petroleum hydrocarbon reduction reached approximately 80% over this time period.

They provide information of past climate, tectonics, carbon global inventory, and can be prolific hosts for oil/gas resources. In this paper, we present, for the first time, an analysis of the entire Magdalena Submarine Fan (MSF), from the shelf break to the distal domain, based on similar to 224,000 km(2) of multibeam bathymetry, as well as backscatter, subbottom profiler and regional/local seismic reflection data recently acquired in southwestern Caribbean Sea. The aim is to describe in detail the MSF morphology and depositional architecture, propose a fan segmentation landform assemblage, and determine its extent within the deep basin. Three fan segments are identified: upper, middle and lower fans. The upper fan extends from the coastline to a depth of similar to 3000 m. Its eastern sector is characterized by a canyon system off the present-day mouth of the Magdalena River, through which most of the sediments are transported downslope to be deposited in intra-slope basins bounded by structural highs of the South Caribbean Deformed Belt. The western upper fan is characterized by distinct channel-levee complexes that are partially removed by mass transport complexes that originated near the continental shelf edge. The upper to middle fan transition is marked by a decrease in regional gradient from 1 degrees to about 0.3 degrees and local relief, a change from large, irregular sediment waves to more regular waves that slowly decrease in amplitude downslope, and the appearance of erosional megascours. The middle fan bedform assemblage evidences the presence of a channel-lobe transition zone in this sector of the MSF, separating well-defined, upper fan channels from lower fan depositional lobes. The middle to lower fan transition occurs between 3800 and 3950 m and is defined by a further decrease in gradient and by a change from sediment waves to planar parallel-bedded reflectors on subbottom profiles. The lower fan extends to a maximum depth of similar to 4250 m and is characterized by an almost flat seabed (slope of 0.05 degrees), interrupted by a few isolated bathymetric highs and low-relief channels ( < 5 m deep). The entire area of the lower fan is interpreted as an area of turbidity current deposition, with relatively sandy sediments in the south and west giving way to muddier sediments in the northeast, which could correspond to distal fan lobes. The identification of four regional seismic facies related to MSF sedimentation allowed us to constrain the fan extent in the southwestern sector of the Caribbean. Distally, within the Colombia Basin the fan terminates against areas of elevated seafloor (Kogi-Coyaima and Quimbaya seamounts, Aruzi and Ticuna hills, and Beata Ridge), which have acted as barriers to sedimentation. Nevertheless, it was determined that the MSF extends beyond the Colombia Basin and locally reaches the Lower Nicaraguan Rise. In this new scenario, we established that the MSF is much more extensive than previously recognized, with an area of similar to 237,000 km(2), which puts it among the World's largest submarine fans.",,,,,,,,,11,1,0,0,3,1,12,,,0025-3227,1872-6151,,,,,,,,,,"Oceanog & Hydrog Res Ctr Colombia CIOH, Cartagena, ColombiaMaritime Zone Solut, Romsey, Hants, EnglandUniv Nacl Colombia, Dept Geosci, Bogota, Colombia",Oceanog & Hydrog Res Ctr Colombia CIOHMaritime Zone Solut,,,2019-07-24,WOS:000474325700002,,

By accounting for specific animal behaviour in the model, it is possible to identify finer-scale patterns of habitat use. Together with spatially explicit data on anthropogenic activities, models can be used to assess human impacts and inform conservation management. This study used observations of breeding behaviour to identify fine-scale breeding habitats of humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae), as well as potential overlap of these habitats with cumulative anthropogenic impacts.Location Eastern Tropical Atlantic, West Africa.Methods Maxent was used to model humpback distribution using pertinent environmental predictors and an integrated dataset of humpback whale occurrences filtered for breeding-specific behaviours. In conjunction with multiple anthropogenic activities, a subsequent cumulative utilization and impact analysis assessed the degree of overlap between predicted breeding habitat and potential anthropogenic impacts.Results Greatest habitat suitability occurred in warm coastal waters of Gabon, and other highly suitable areas occurred off Equatorial Guinea (Bioko Island), Cameroon and Angola. Sea surface temperature and height contributed most to the model. Highest overlap between humpback whales and potential impacts from anthropogenic activities occurred off Gabon, Equatorial Guinea (Bioko Island), Cameroon and Angola. Impacts associated with oil and gas development (where oil and gas platforms serve as an indicator for industry activity) appeared to contribute most to potential cumulative impact.Main Conclusions Depth and sea surface temperature of predicted breeding habitats were consistent with previous studies. However, lesser known characteristics such as sea surface height and wind speed, resulting in potentially more sheltered areas for breeding whales, may also be important in delineating finer-scale habitat suitability. Identified areas of high potential cumulative impact occurred within exclusive economic zones of multiple countries and likely represent the minimum level of impact to humpback whales in the region, highlighting the need for additional research and effective management throughout the area.",,,,,,,,,9,1,0,0,9,0,9,,,1366-9516,1472-4642,,,,,,,,,,"Wildlife Conservat Soc, Ocean Giants Program, Bronx, NY 10460 USAColumbia Univ, Ecol Evolut & Environm Biol Dept, New York, NY USANat Resources Def Council, New York, NY USAUniv Washington, Sch Interdisciplinary Arts & Sci, Bothell, WA USAWildlife Conservat Soc, Global Conservat Program, Bronx, NY USA",Nat Resources Def Council,,,2020-03-10,WOS:000515427700001,,

They constitute major ecosystems of tropical to subtropical muddy coasts that perform several ecological functions, including: mitigation of coastal erosion and flooding hazards associated with storm waves, extreme tides and tsunami, providing nurseries for some estuarine and coastal species (e.g., shrimps, fishes), production and recycling of organic matter, carbon storage, functioning as long-term sinks for several contaminants. World mangroves face a number of threats with increasing habitat destruction caused by direct and indirect anthropogenic pressures coupled with global climate change. They are known to be extremely vulnerable to oil spills. Even if the fate and impact of oil spills in such ecosystems have been partially monitored and experimentally studied (e.g., 30-year TROPICS field experiment in Panama islands, replicated field trials conducted in central Queensland, Australia) significant gaps in knowledge remain. The oil dynamic in such ecosystem is complex and depends on the abiotic-biotic processes interactions. Understanding the fate and impact of the oil spill thus requires an integrated approach of the functioning of the whole mangroves system facing the pollution.

However, the factors that affect their variability remain poorly understood. This paper assesses how landscape-level attributes (patch size and matrix composition) influence carbon storage in seagrass sediments. We quantified the organic carbon (C-org) content and other geochemical properties (8(13)C and particle size) in surface sediments of continuous Posidonia oceanica meadows, patchy meadows interspersed with rocky-algal reefs and patchy meadows on sedimentary bottoms. We also took samples of potential carbon sources for isotopic composition determination. Our results indicate that the continuous meadows accumulated larger amounts of Corg than patchy meadows, whether embedded in a rock or sand matrix. The Corg from continuous meadows was also more C-13 enriched, which suggests that a high proportion of the carbon was derived from plant material (autochthonous sources); in contrast in patchy meadows (especially in a sand matrix), lower 8(13)C values indicated a higher contribution from allochthonous sources (mainly suspended particulate organic matter, SPOM). These findings suggest that the sediment of continuous meadows stores more Corg in than that of patchy meadows. This is probably due to the increased contribution from seagrass leaves, which are much more refractory than SPOM. In general, certain landscape configurations, and especially patchiness, appear to reduce the carbon storage capacity of seagrasses. Since the current decline of seagrass is leading to habitat fragmentation, our results increase the argument for the promotion of effective measures to preserve the integrity of these natural carbon sinks.

Few attempts have been made to develop restoration techniques for seaweed beds in intertidal ecosystems, owing to the complex and dynamic variations in physical conditions of the habitat. We developed a new Sargassum thunbergii restoration method involving creating intertidal habitat and seeding with artificially collected germlings. In June 2010, artificial rectangular pools constructed of a 4:5:1 rate of high-strength cement, sand and water on a rocky intertidal platform were seeded with S. thunbergii germlings released from fertile thalli during low tide. Artificial pools were covered with a double-layer shading net until the next tidal cycle to prevent germlings from being dislodged by water motion, resulting in a majority of young germlings successfully attaching to the pool bottom by rapid development of rhizoids. Two months after seeding, juvenile sporophytes attained a length of 15-20 mm. After one year following seeding. S. thunbergii in the restored bed reached a density of 118.5 +/- 13.2 (mean +/- SE) thalli m(-2), covered 32.7 +/- 0.1% of the artificial substrate, and grew to an average length of 34.2 +/- 1.6 cm with 7.3 +/- 0.6 laterals per thallus. The proportion of fertile laterals of restored population was 73.6 +/- 3.0%, indicating that these fertile thalli may serve as a source of new recruits to enhance the recovery of the algal population. Furthermore, restored S. thunbergii beds facilitated the presence of seven other species of macroalgae with species richness (R), diversity (H') and evenness (J') reaching 0.65 +/- 0.04, 1.06 +/- 0.09 and 0.67 +/- 0.05. respectively. Therefore, the construction of artificial pools coupled with seeding germlings in natural habitat may be an effective approach for the restoration of S. thunbergii, and potentially other seaweeds in rocky intertidal habitats.

This award provides funds to expand research capability through the creation of a new Integrated Analytical Laboratory to facilitate research and opportunities for collaboration. Facilities for sediment analysis will help scientists understand complex coastal processes and help to guide adaptation and coastal resiliency actions that coastal communities must make. Such research is vital in light of the fact that sea levels are rising more dramatically in the northeast Atlantic than almost anywhere else in the world. Data from long-term population biology and ecology studies provide an invaluable foundation for assessing climate change impacts over the past 30 years and projecting into the future. They are particularly essential for understanding the remaining population of the endangered North Atlantic right whales that feed and nurse their young along the heavily industrialized and developed shore of eastern Massachusetts. The improvements will more than triple the size of current laboratory space, and expand opportunities for collaboration with other scientific and academic institutions. The new laboratory will consist of facilities for water quality analysis, biological sample analysis and sediment analysis. Expanded laboratory capacity for water quality analysis will be essential in helping the region implement its EPA 208 Water Quality plan and remedy issues of nitrogen pollution in Cape Cod?s bays, inlets and harbors. The new laboratory facilities will also protect sensitive research archives generated by the Center?s multi-decade history of marine mammal research. The improved facilities will increase opportunities for graduate students, interns and apprentices, and enhance CCS?s unique ability and opportunity to interact with the public, thanks to its prominence in environmental education and outreach in a popular tourist destination. CCS?s STEM-based school programs, more than 100 annual public programs, public kiosk and Marine Discovery Center, and other outreach directly impacts nearly 20,000 people of all ages each year. The products of research will also help resource managers to better protect threatened and endangered environments and species.

Recent phytoplankton increments followed, once Fe-, P-, and N-nutrient limitations of commensal diazotrophs and dinoflagellates were also eliminated by respective human desertification, deforestation, and eutrophication during climate changes. Si-limitation of diatoms instead ensued during these last anthropogenic perturbations of agricultural effluents and sewage loadings. Consequently, similar to 15% of total world-wide annual asthma trigger responses, i.e. amounting to similar to 45 million adjacent humans during 2004, resulted from brevetoxin and palytoxin poisons in aerosol forms of western boundary current origins. They were denoted by greater global harmful algal bloom[HAB] abundances and breathing attacks among sea-side children during prior decadal surveys of asthma prevalence, compiled here in ten paired shelf ecosystems of western and eutrophied boundary currents. Since 1965, such inferred onshore fluxes of aerosolized DOC poisons of HABs may have served as additional wind-borne organic carriers of toxic marine MeHg, phthalate, and DDT/DDE vectors, traced by radio-iodine isotopes to potentially elicit carcinomas. During these exchanges, as much as 40% of mercury poisonings may instead have been effected by inhalation of collateral HAB-carried marine neurotoxic aerosols of MeHg, not just from eating marine fish.

This requires an understanding of environmental impact potential and detectability of a range of hypothetical leak scenarios. In the absence of a significant body of real-world release experiments this study collates the results of 86 modelled scenarios of offshore marine releases derived from five different model systems. This synthesis demonstrates a consistent generalised relationship between leak rate, detectability and impact potential of a wide range of hypothetical releases from CO2 storage, which can be described by a power law. For example a leak of the order of 1 T per day should be detectable at, at least, 60 m distance with an environmental impact restricted to less than a 15 m radius of the release point. Small releases are likely to require bottom mounted (lander) monitoring to ensure detection. In summary this work, when coupled with a quantification of leakage risk can deliver a first order environmental impact assessment as an aid to the consenting process. Further this work demonstrates that non-catastrophic release events can be detected at thresholds well below levels which would undermine storage performance or significantly impact the environment, given an appropriate monitoring strategy.",,,,,,,,,31,1,0,0,2,0,32,,,1750-5836,1878-0148,,,,,,,,,,"Plymouth Marine Lab, Prospect Pl, Plymouth PL1 3DH, Devon, EnglandUniv Bergen, Dept Math, Bergen, NorwayNORCE Norwegian Res Ctr, Bjerknes Ctr Climate Res, Bergen, NorwayNatl Oceanog Ctr, Joseph Proudman Bldg,6 Brownlow St, Liverpool L3 5DA, Merseyside, EnglandHeriot Watt Univ, Inst Mech Proc & Energy Engn, Edinburgh EH14 4AS, Midlothian, Scotland",,,,2020-06-23,WOS:000539340100002,,

Fossil fuel based power plants can produce energy at competitive prices with other energy sources even if equipped with capture facilities. Thus, the fossil fuel industry is ready to implement carbon capture and storage (CCS) once a CO(2) tax regime or its equivalent is introduced. Questions associated with accounting for leaky storage reservoirs over millennial time scales in a carbon credit regime and estimating impacts of CO(2) on climate and ocean ecosystems will then have to be addressed in order to estimate the benefits and possible damage from any given storage project. Available environmental models for such questions have only limited validation data but are foreseen to play a key role, and acquisition of required site specific data may be costly. Experience from the past 15 years of research on CO(2) storage options and the associated science - policy interface suggests that uncertain models tend to be trusted too much by policy makers. In some cases, good intentions for environmental protection lead to a compartmentalized approach that is unsuitable for global problems where tradeoffs may be inevitable.

Different P. oceanica samples were collected in the shipwrecked site under different light conditions. Using high-performance thin-layer chromatography, metabolic analysis of the samples was carried out in order to highlight possible changes in the secondary metabolism due to the permanent shading and the presence of pollutant traces. Moreover, sample mutagenicity, as a consequence of the possible absorption of environmental toxicants leaked by the wreck, was assessed by the Ames test. The results highlighted the permanence of the Concordia-induced alteration in the plant secondary metabolites. However, absorption of chemical pollutants and carcinogens was not reported; this point was confirmed by the lack of mutagenic effects found for the samples tested. Our results clearly evidence that the environmental impact of Costa Concordia wreck and removal operations on P. oceanica was mainly due to the lack of light in the marine habitat.

The study sites represent a gradient from sheltered to exposed locations in both regions to reflect expected minimum and maximum stocks and accumulation. The C-org stock integrated over the top 25 cm of the sediment averaged 627 g C m(-2) in Finland, while in Denmark the average C-org stock was over 6 times higher (4324 g Cm-2). A conservative estimate of the total organic carbon pool in the regions ranged between 6.98 and 44.9 t C ha(-1). Our results suggest that the Finnish eelgrass meadows are minor carbon sinks compared to the Danish meadows, and that majority of the C-org produced in the Finnish meadows is exported. Our analysis further showed that >40% of the variation in the C-org stocks was explained by sediment characteristics, i.e. dry density, porosity and silt content. In addition, our analysis show that the root : shoot ratio of Z. marina explained >12% and the contribution of Z. marina detritus to the sediment surface C-org pool explained >10% of the variation in the C-org stocks.

This study examined two methods for estimating reef size that were employed on a large-scale matrix of 30 separate artificial reefs constructed off the west coast of Scotland: (1) measurements made by standard SCUBA divers and (2) estimates based on raster graphic image analysis of images created from multibeam echosounder (MBES) xyz datasets.

To achieve this effectiveness, it will require widespread global deployment in a new industry which would rival the current oil and gas industry in its scale and ambition. Many of the technologies for carbon dioxide storage are the adaptations of oil and gas technology, but there are some important differences. These arise from:1. the thermodynamic properties of carbon dioxide,2. the essential requirement for long-term storage site integrity,3. the absence of an established and mature business model for the industry and4. the contrasting regulatory environments between carbon capture and storage and oil and gas extraction.Whilst the underground injection of carbon dioxide can truly be considered a proven technology, there are a range of engineering challenges to achieve this in a safe and cost effective manner.

Two important benthic invertebrates in the California Current System (CCS), the Dungeness crab and the red sea urchin, are used as examples of the way in which physical oceanographic conditions can influence stability, synchrony and persistence of meroplanktonic metapopulations. We first explore population dynamics of subpopulations and metapopulations. Even without environmental forcing, isolated local subpopulations with density-dependence can vary on time scales roughly twice the generation time at high adult survival, shifting to annual time scales at low survivals. The high frequency behavior is not seen in models of the Dungeness crab, because of their high adult survival rates. Metapopulations with density-dependent recruitment and deterministic larval dispersal fluctuate in an asynchronous fashion. Along the coast, abundance varies on spatial scales which increase with dispersal distance. Coastwide, synchronous, random environmental variability tends to synchronize these metapopulations. Climate change could cause a long-term increase or decrease in mean larval survival, which in this model leads to greater synchrony or extinction respectively. Spatially managed metapopulations of red sea urchins go extinct when distances between harvest refugia become greater than the scale of larval dispersal. All assessments of population dynamics indicate that metapopulation behavior in general depends critically on the temporal and spatial nature of larval dispersal, which is largely determined by physical oceanographic conditions. We therefore explore physical influences on larval dispersal patterns. Observed trends in temperature and salinity applied to laboratory-determined responses indicate that natural variability in temperature and salinity can lead to variability in larval development period on interannual (50%), intra-annual (20%) and latitudinal (200%) scales. Variability in development period significantly influences larval survival and, thus, net transport. Larval drifters that undertake diel vertical migration in a primitive equation model of coastal circulation (SPEM) demonstrate the importance of vertical migration in determining horizontal transport. Empirically derived estimates of the effects of wind forcing on larval transport of vertically migrating larvae (wind drift when near the surface and Ekman transport below the surface) match cross-shelf distributions in 4 years of existing larval data. We use a one-dimensional advection-diffusion model, which includes intra-annual timing of cross-shelf flows in the CCS, to explore the combined effects on settlement of: (1) temperature- and salinity-dependent development and survival rates and (2) possible horizontal transport due to vertical migration of crab larvae. Natural variability in temperature, wind forcing, and the timing of the spring transition can cause the observed variability in recruitment. We conclude that understanding the dynamics of coastally distributed metapopulations in response to physically-induced variability in larval dispersal will be a critical step in assessing the effects of climate change on marine populations.",,,,,,,,,108,0,0,0,38,1,121,,,0967-0645,1879-0100,,,,,,,,,,"UNIV CALIF DAVIS, CTR POPULAT BIOL, INST THEORET DYNAM, DIV ENVIRONM STUDIES, DAVIS, CA 95616 USAUNIV CALIF SAN DIEGO, SCRIPPS INST OCEANOG, LA JOLLA, CA 92093 USA",,,,1994-01-01,WOS:A1994NK10400005,,

Sargassum filipendula was considered a characteristic plant in 35-40 feet. No other algal complex or species seemed to dominate on the reefs in this depth. Vast carpets of Halimeda scabra were observed at most of the 45-60 feet stations. Rhipocephalus phoenix and Sargassum filipendula were often associated with Halimeda. Ninety-five taxa were found in 35-40 feet in eight collections. One hundred and eleven taxa were found in 45-60 feet in twelve collections. A total of 158 taxa were found during the study. The red algae, though high in species numbers, were small in biomass in both depths. However, when metal wrecks were encountered, the biomass of red algae was large. The epiphytic flora, a large percentage of which were red algae, accounted for nearly one-half the total number of species found. Eleven species were newly reported for the state, and 47 represent northward range extensions from Dry Tortugas. On the basis of this study and comparison with Taylor's work at Dry Tortugas, a more or less constant relationship between the various algal groupings is seen. Although different species are included in the two areas, those relationships seem to denote that they are more than just a function of the number of possible species. The factors which might regulate these relationships are unknown to us. || ABSTRACT AUTHORS: R. C. Phillips",,,,,,,,,11,0,0,0,3,1,13,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Florida State Bd. Conserv. Mar.

However, spatial heterogeneity in these blue carbon stocks among and within habitats has only recently been examined, despite its considerable implications. Seagrass meadows have potential to store significant amounts of carbon in their sediments, yet studies comparing sediment OC content at regional and meadow scales remain sparse. Here, we collected sediment cores from six temperate eelgrass (Zostera marina) meadows on the coast of British Columbia, Canada, to quantify sediment OC stocks, accumulation rates, and sources, and to examine local and regional drivers of variability. Sediment OC content was highly variable-across all sites, stocks in the top 0-5 cm ranged from 83 to 1089 g OC m(-2), while the 15-20 cm stocks exhibited a 24-fold difference, from 59 to 1407 g OC m(-2). Carbon accumulation rates ranged from 4 to 33 g OC m(-2) yr(-1). Isotopic mixing models revealed that sediment OC was primarily terrestrial carbon (41.3%) and canopy-forming kelps (33.3%), with a smaller contribution of eelgrass (25.3%). Here, we show that regional variability in OC content exceeds meadow-scale variability. This result is likely driven by landscape factors, most notably relative water motion, representing a more dominant control on seagrass OC accumulation than meadow-scale factors such as canopy complexity. These findings elicit caution when scaling up seagrass meadow OC content and demonstrate that measures of the hydrodynamic environment could improve estimates of carbon storage in temperate soft sediment habitats.",,,,,,,,,23,0,0,0,12,0,27,,,0024-3590,1939-5590,,,,,,,,,,"Tula Fdn, Hakai Inst, Heriot Bay, BC, CanadaSimon Fraser Univ, Sch Resource & Environm Management, Burnaby, BC, Canada",,,,2019-11-01,WOS:000495506200006,,

Tar balls, tar mats, and tar patties are common examples of marine tar residues and can range in size from millimeters in diameter (tar balls) to several meters in length and width (tar mats). These residues can remain in the ocean environment indefinitely, decomposing or becoming buried in the sea floor. However, in many cases, they are transported ashore via currents and waves where they pose a concern to coastal recreation activities, the seafood industry and may have negative effects on wildlife. This review summarizes the current state of knowledge on marine tar residue formation, transport, degradation, and distribution. Methods of detection and removal of marine tar residues and their possible ecological effects are discussed, in addition to topics of marine tar research that warrant further investigation.

To assess the effects of a tidal energy device on fishes, we used down-looking single-beam hydroacoustic technology to collect pre-deployment data on the presence and vertical distribution of fishes at a pilot project site and a control site in Cobscook Bay, ME. Twenty-four-hour stationary surveys were conducted in each season of 2010 and 2011. Relative fish density and vertical distribution were analyzed for variation with respect to site, year, month, and diel and tidal cycles. A seasonal pattern in fish density was apparent in both years at both sites, with maxima in spring and late fall. Fish density was generally highest near the sea floor. Diel changes in vertical distribution were frequently observed, but changes in distribution related to tidal cycle were inconsistent. Results from the project and control sites were very similar, demonstrating that the control site provides a reference for quantifying changes in fish density and vertical distribution related to the tidal device.

Suction sampling in macroalgae, seagrass, and coarse calcareous sand habitats and visual surveys of artificial patch reefs were conducted systematically in 1991 to 1994 during wintertime onshore movement of late larval-early juvenile Nassau grouper within the vicinity of Lee Stocking Island, Bahamas. Recently settled fish [($) over bar X = 32 mm total length (TL)] resided within coral clumps (Porites spp.) covered by masses of macroalgae (primarily Laurencia spp.), with highest densities at 8 fish m(-2). There was a positive and significant linear relationship between percent algal cover and post-settlement grouper density. Other habitat features such as algal displacement volume, and the numbers of holes, ledges, and sponges did not explain any significant variation in post-settlement density. Visual transects performed 4 to 5 mo after the settlement period (June) indicated that early juveniles (($) over bar X = 85 mm TL) residing within or adjacent to algal-covered coral clumps were mostly solitary (88%). Growth rates during February to June averaged 10 mm mo(-1) in 1993.

During 3 separate annual sampling periods, a decrease in early juvenile densities in macroalgal habitats from June to October was matched by a concomitant increase in abundance in artificial patch reefs located seaward of the macroalgal habitat. These habitat-specific abundance patterns suggest that juvenile Nassau grouper exhibit an ontogenetic habitat shift from macroalgal-Porites spp, clumps to patch-reef habitats at a size of 120 to 150 mm TL during late summer and early fall. Based on habitat associations observed in this study, E, striatus were classified into 3 stages: (1) post-settlement fish (25 to 35 mm TL) residing exclusively within algal-covered coral clumps; (2) early juveniles (60 to 150 mm TL) residing outside oi and adjacent to algal-covered coral clumps; and (3) larger juveniles (> 150 mm TL), which were generally associated with natural and artificial patch reefs.",,,,,,,,,140,0,0,0,82,1,159,,,0171-8630,,,,,,,,,,,"CARIBBEAN MARINE RES CTR, EXUMA CAYS, BAHAMAS",CARIBBEAN MARINE RES CTR,,,1995-08-01,WOS:A1995RW86700002,,

Based on a 3D geological model and oil production history, 16 scenarios of water-alternating-CO2 injection operations with different water alternating gas (WAG) ratios and slug sizes, as well as continuous CO2 injection (Con-CO2) and primary depletion production (No-CO2) scenarios, have been simulated spanning 20 years. The results represent a significant improvement in oil recovery by CO2 WAG over both Con-CO2 and No-CO2 scenarios. The WAG ratio and slug size of water affect the efficiency of oil recovery and CO2 injection. The optimum operations are those with WAG ratios lower than 1:2, which have the higher ultimate oil recovery factor of 24%. Although WAG reduced the CO2 injection volume, the CO2 storage efficiency is still high, more than 84% of the injected CO2 was sequestered in the reservoir. Results indicate that the immiscible water-alternating-CO2 processes can be optimized to improve significantly the performance of pressure maintenance and oil recovery in offshore reef heavy-oil reservoirs significantly.

The results are analysed for different disposition of residuals and initial current direction and intensity. We show that the distance between the bore hole centre and the residuals is the key parameter controlling the filling by drill residuals; the current direction plays a negligible role in monopile while this distance remains smaller than 20 m; the filling of tripod is strongly influenced by current effects and seabed morphology.

The deposits overlying the Hot Shale yielded diverse assemblages of palynomorphs, the occurrence of Angochitina qusaibaensis and Leiofusa banderillae in particular indicating a late Rhuddanian-Telychian (Llandovery) age. Two palynofacies associations have been identified. The Hot Shale palynofacies (PF-A) contains Type-II >= I kerogen, which is highly oil-prone and reflects a distal suboxic-anoxic sedimentary environment. The palynofacies of the overlying deposits of the Tanezzuft Formation (PF-B) is dominated by Type-II/III kerogen, which is both oil- and gas-prone, and indicates depositional conditions that range from distal dysoxic-oxic shelf to mud-dominated oxic shelf (distal shelf). Rock-Eval pyrolysis results indicate that the Hot Shale is organically-rich with an average total organic carbon (TOC) content 7.23 wt%, whereas the TOC of the overlying deposits averages 0.62 wt%. The organic matter in the Hot Shale has the capability of generating more liquid hydrocarbons than the rest of the formation, which lies within the early oilmaturity window. A simulated burial history for the NC115 Concession allowed the time and magnitude of hydrocarbon generation from the main Silurian Tanezzuft Formation source rock to be determined. Oil generation from this source rock took place during the Carboniferous/mid-Cretaceous period, whereas the maturation level for gas had not been reached at this stage.",,,,,,,,,2,0,0,0,1,0,2,,,1464-343X,1879-1956,,,,,,,,,,"Mansoura Univ, Geol Dept, Fac Sci, Mansoura 35516, EgyptUniv Manchester, Sch Earth Atmospher & Environm Sci, Oxford Rd, Manchester M13 9PL, Lancs, England",,,,2019-03-12,WOS:000459841400026,,

Designing of such facilities requires calculation of the wave force. However, wave force calculations have previously been made using a computer because the mathematical treatment of waves is complex and even in the easiest wave theory, a hyperbolic function was applied. Furthermore it needed an integral calculation incorporating the water depth. On the other hand, currently available scientific electronic calculators are commonly equipped with a hyperbolic function and memory function. Consequently, we devised a simplified method of wave force calculation using a scientific electronic calculator and compared it with the conventional method using a computer. We regarded such fishery facilities as submerged cylinders for the sake of simplicity and calculated the wave force acting on them by both methods. It became clear that we can regard that there is little difference between wave force estimated by the simplified method and the one by the conventional method if the cylinder length is smaller than 0.167 times the wave length. That means the simplified method is effective. Finally, the calculation by the simplified method requires only a scientific electronic calculator, which allows the wave calculation to be easily done by hand. Furthermore the simplified method is applicable for use in lectures about wave force and thus has applications in education.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,,0,0,0,,,0370-9361,,,,,,,,,,,"Natl Fisheries Univ, Dept Fishery Sci and Technol, Yamaguchi, Japan",,,,2006-01-01,BCI:BCI200700042595,,

The Offshore Safety Case regulations (Health and Safety Executive, 1992, A Guide ro rite Offshore Installations (Safety Case) Regulations) put the onus on the operator to identify the major hazards and to reduce the risks to As Low As is Reasonably Practicable (ALARP). The regulations specifically state that Quantitative Risk Assessments (QRA) must be used when preparing the Safety Case. However, people do not use QRA when making everyday judgements about risk; they make subjective judgements known as risk perceptions, which are influenced by a number of different factors. This study was designed to complement the extensive QRA calculations that have already been carried out in the development of Safety Cases. The aim was to measure subjective risk perception in offshore personnel and examine how this relates to the more objective risk data available, namely accident records and QRA calculations. This paper describes the Offshore Risk Perception Questionnaire developed to collect the data and reports on UK offshore workers' perceptions of the risks associated with major and miner hazards, work tasks and other activities aboard production platforms.

Sigma EPAH (Sixteen US EPA priority PAHs) were 2.7-350.9 ng/g. Petroleum residue was the major contributor of PAHs in the coastal sediments of China due to oil leakage from ships and offshore oil fields. The contribution of vehicular emissions in coast of North China was significantly lower than that in the Changjiang Estuary, and the reverse was true for coal combustion. PAH concentrations in the sediment core of the Changjiang estuary steadily increased upward and the variation was primarily due to economic development and severe floods. The impact on PAHs by vehicular emissions (37.2%) and petrogenic sources (45.8%) overwhelmed combustion sources (17.0%). (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Developing our understanding of the pros and cons of a range of strategies designed to reduce CO2 emissions is vital. Of the available strategies such as wind, wave and solar renewables and Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) none are without potential problems or limitations.

If CCS is successful existing fossil fuel reserves could be used whilst new forms of power generation with low CO2 emissions are developed. A few projects have been successfully demonstrating either capture or storage on limited scales, so it is established that the technical challenges are surmountable. Research is also demonstrating that the geological structures are in general robust for long term storage (for example oil deposits remain in place within geological strata).

The aim of the present study is to determine why this deep-sea canyon provides suitable environmental conditions for corals to grow. This hanging canyon is characterized by an irregular U-shaped floor with two narrow differentiated flanks. Sand ripples and rocky outcrops structured in diverse W-E directed steps are observed on the canyon floor, suggesting intense hydrodynamic activity. Accordingly, high-frequency near-bottom current and thermal structure profiles showed that there occur strong shifts in currents/hydrography behaving as front-like features at each tidal cycle. These involve the sudden increase of along-axis velocities to over 50 cm/s and vertical velocities of over 5 cm/s in each tidal cycle associated with the passage of sharp thermal fronts and thermal inversions suggesting overturning. A year-long near-bottom current record showed events with near-bottom velocities well over 1 m/s lasting for several days.Three cold-water coral settings were distinguished: a dense coral reef located on stepped rocky bottoms of the eastern and western flanks, carbonate mounds (20-30 m high) located on the canyon floor, and a cluster of shallower water dead coral framework at the head sector of the canyon. Video and still images from a towed sled and ROV verified the presence of dropstones and rippled sand sheets surrounding the mounds and revealed changes in the coral population (alive or dead; total or patchy coverage) in coral reef and carbonate mound areas. The dominant species of the reef are Lophelia pertusa and Madrepora oculata, which considerably increase the habitat's complexity and biodiversity in relation to other facies described in the canyon. The presence of living cold-water reefs is directly related to a high-energy environment at depths between 700 and 1200 m in the levels between the lower bound of Eastern North Atlantic Central Water (ENACW) and the core of Mediterranean Water (MW). Such level matches the water density range sigma(theta)=27.35-27.65 kg m(-3) which has been identified as limits for coldwater coral distribution in the North Atlantic. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Most of the reviewed literature confirmed that heavy metal concentrations in marine organisms were generally within allowable concentrations and pose no threat to public health. Likewise, studies suggested that levels of heavy metals in marine sediments are similar or lower compared to other regions. However, localized hotspots of chronic metal pollution in areas influenced by industrial facilities, desalination plants, and oil refineries have been reported. Holistic spatial and temporal monitoring and comprehensive national and regional strategies are critical to combat and manage heavy metal pollution in the Arabian Gulf. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

In the Galapagos Islands, the endangered, endemic Galapagos sea lion (Zalophus wollebaeki) has formed one of the biggest colonies within the town center of Puerto Baquerizo Moreno. About 8,000 people live there and human wildlife interactions occur daily. With colony counts and direct observations from 2008 to 2012, we analyze cause of death, injuries and disease of urban sea lion colonies at Wreck Bay. Population increase since 2008 can be attributed to an immigration of adult sea lions in 2010, resulting in an increase in the pup and juvenile production in 2011 and 2012. Pup mortality increased drastically to 2009 and again in 2011 and 2012. Besides pup mortality, most of the deaths are caused by increased disease incidences and human activity. Our observations suggest that overall 65% of the injuries observed are produced by human interaction.The increase in threats leading to death, injuries or disease can have long-term effects on the population. Although threats that cause physical injuries can be managed locally, sea lions range movements contributes to the spread of infectious pathogens, which may affect neighbor colonies and potentially have an impact on the survival of the species. Our study reveals the need of stronger efforts towards a more complete understanding of threats and especially disease spread among Galapagos Sea lions in urban environments and the establishment of more effective management measures.(c) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

In this study, the strains that evolved in the sediment were screened by high-throughput sequencing technology. Most of these strains were genera reported to have functions associated with crude oil biodegradation. The diversities and numbers of microbes were monitored through enrichment culturing; the dominant strains propagated at first, but the enrichment could not be continued, which indicated that the prolonged culture was not effective in the enrichment of the micro-consortium. Oxygen was also observed to affect the propagation of the dominant microbes. The results showed the role of culture strategies and oxygen in the enrichment of the petroleum-degrading microbes. Therefore, dominant strains could be screened by optimizing both the enrichment time and oxygen concentration used for culturing to facilitate oil biodegradation in the marine ecosystem.

The experiment, which aimed to understand detectability and potential effects on the marine environment should there be any leakage from a CO2 storage site, provided a rare opportunity to study the social aspects of a carbon dioxide capture and storage-related event taking place in a lived-in environment. Qualitative research was carried out in the form of observation at public information events about the release, in-depth interviews with key project staff and local stakeholders/community members, and a review of online media coverage of the experiment. Focusing mainly on the observation and interview data, we discuss three key findings: the role of experience and analogues in learning about unfamiliar concepts like CO2 storage; the challenge of addressing questions of uncertainty in public engagement; and the issue of when to commence engagement and how to frame the discussion. We conclude that whilst there are clearly slippages between a small-scale experiment and full-scale CCS, the social research carried out for this project demonstrates that issues of public and stakeholder perception are as relevant for offshore CO2 storage as they are for onshore.

Integrating CCS in a power plant adds significant costs which can be offset by a sufficient CO2 price. However, most markets have failed: currently, the weak carbon price threatens CCS deployment in the European Union (EU). In China, a carbon regulation is appearing and CCS encounters a rising interest. This study investigates two questions: how much is the extra-cost of a CCS plant in the EU in comparison with China? Second, what is the CO2 price beyond which CCS plants become more profitable than reference plants in the EU and in China? To address these issues, I conducted a literature review on public studies about CCS costs. To objectively assess the profitability of CCS plants, I constructed a net present value model to calculate the Levelised Cost of Electricity and the breakeven CO2 price. CCS plants become the most profitable plant type beyond 115 /tCO(2) in the Eli vs. 45 (sic)/tCO(2) in China (offshore transport and storage costs). I advise on the optimal plant type choice depending on the CO2 price in both countries. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

The ANT framework has been applied to four case studies in California using data collected in a field study that consisted of interviewing 30 stakeholders working closely with the issue of marine offsetting. Employing ANT allowed to ascertain the role of commonly studied elements such as impacted ecosystems, sizing methodologies and ecological engineering techniques. Further, it highlighted the key role of other critical factors, such as 'skilled intermediaries', who succeed in overcoming uncertainties generated by the use of new tools and contribute to leading other stakeholders towards the goal: the offset instrument. These mediators call upon effective translation processes to put forward new arguments: a change in spatial and temporal scales and adaptive solutions.

The biotic assemblages of these lakes can be particularly species rich, especially in terms of the aquatic invertebrate fauna. Despite their potential conservation value, relatively little is known about their physico-chemical or biological characteristics in northern Europe in comparison to other freshwater habitats, and their undisturbed reference conditions are still unknown in Ireland. We surveyed upland and lowland blanket bog lakes, across both sedimentary (sandstone) and igneous (granite) geologies, to compare baseline physico-chemical and biological conditions for blanket bog lakes in western Ireland. A comprehensive data set of water chemistry, Chydoridae, littoral macroinvertebrates and aquatic macrophyte taxa were collected from all lakes over a twelve-month period beginning in March 2009. The main difference in lake hydrochemistry was that the lowland lakes, situated at lower altitude and in closer proximity to the coast than the upland lakes, had significantly higher conductivity and major ion (sodium [Na], chloride [Cl], magnesium [Mg], potassium [K] and sulphate [SO4]) concentrations because of the greater influence of atmospheric (sea spray) deposition. The upland lakes were also significantly cooler and had higher concentrations of total phosphorus (TP). Differences were also evident between the upland and lowland lakes in the chydorid, littoral macroinvertebrate and macrophyte communities, primarily caused by marine-driven hydrochemical variation and differences in benthic substrate. The chemical effect of marine deposition appeared to have a much greater impact on lake hydrochemistry and biology than either underlying geology or altitude. This is the first study of its kind to be carried out on blanket bog lakes in Ireland.

To better understand how salt marshes will respond to warming and associated shifts in precipitation, we conducted a manipulative experiment in a tidal salt marsh in Massachusetts, USA. We exposed two plant communities (one dominated by Spartina patens-Distichlis spicata and one dominated by short form Spartina alterniflora) to five climate manipulations: warming via passive open-topped chambers, doubled precipitation, warming and doubled precipitation, extreme drought via rainout shelter, and ambient conditions. Modest daytime warming increased total aboveground biomass of the S. alterniflora community (24%), but not the S. patens-D. spicata community. Warming also increased maximum stem heights of S. alterniflora (8%), S. patens (8%), and D. spicata (15%). Decomposition was marginally accelerated by warming in the S. alterniflora community. Drought markedly increased total biomass of the S. alterniflora community (53%) and live S. patens (69%), perhaps by alleviating waterlogging of sediments. Decomposition was accelerated by increased precipitation and slowed by drought, particularly in the S. patens-D. spicata community. Flowering phenology responded minimally to the treatments, and pore water salinity, sulfide, ammonium, and phosphate concentrations showed no treatment effects in either plant community. Our results suggest that these salt marsh communities may be resilient to modest amounts of warming and large changes in precipitation. If production increases under climate change, marshes will have a greater ability to keep pace with sea-level rise, although an increase in decomposition could offset this. As long as marshes are not inundated by flooding due to sea-level rise, increases in aboveground biomass and stem heights suggest that marshes may continue to export carbon and nutrients to coastal waters and may be able to increase their carbon storage capability by increasing plant growth under future climate conditions.",,,,,,,,,106,7,0,0,84,0,133,,,1051-0761,1939-5582,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Massachusetts, Dept Biol, Boston, MA 02125 USA",,,,2009-10-01,WOS:000269942500007,19831068,

An investigation was carried out in 2002 to inspect four wrecks by using a rernote-operated vehicle with video cameras. The Norwegian Defence Research Establishment (Forsvarets forskningsinstitutt, FFI) carried out the project on behalf of the Norwegian Pollution Control Authority (SFT). Sediment samples were collected at eight positions around each wreck. One of the wrecks was broken up into several smaller parts. Here sediments were collected at one additional position close to one of the parts. From each position, at least two sediment cores were taken up to the surface. One of the cores from each position was sliced into three parts that were immediately frozen. The other whole cores were frozen on board the ship and transported back to the laboratory in a freezer. In total, sediment samples from 33 different locations were collected and analysed for organoarsenic warfare agents and some of their decomposition products by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) after derivatisation with 1-propanethiol.Most of the identified organoarsenic compounds found in the sediment samples are parts of the arsine oil mixture produced by Germany during World War II. The compounds were found both close to the wreck and at a somewhat longer distance from the wrecks. The highest concentrations were found in a sediment sample collected close to a bomb seen on the seabed. The organoarsenic warfare agents adamsite or lewisite were not found in any of the samples. Lewisite is not reported to have been produced during World War II, but was nevertheless looked for in the samples. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

Currently, mitigation efforts are proving ineffectual in reducing anthropogenic CO2 emissions. Coral reefs are the most sensitive ecosystems on the planet to climate change, and here we review modelling a number of geoengineering options. and their potential influence on coral reefs. There are two categories of geoengineering, short-wave solar radiation management and longwave carbon dioxide removal. The first set of techniques only reduce some, but not all, effects of climate change. while possibly creating other problems. They also do not affect CO2 levels and therefore fail to address the wider effects of rising CO2, including ocean acidification, important for coral reefs. Solar radiation is important to coral growth and survival, and solar radiation management is no in general appropriate for this ecosystem. Longwave carbon dioxide removal techniques address the root cause of climate change, rising CO2 concentrations. they have relatively low uncertainties and risks. They are worthy of further research and potential implementation, particularly carbon capture and storage, biochar, and afforestation methods. alongside increased mitigation of atmospheric CO2 concentrations.

A total of 83 platforms, including deep-water, toppled, Rigs-to-Reefs structures, were surveyed in the northern Gulf of Mexico between 2000 and 2009, from Matagorda Island, Texas to Mobile, Alabama, USA, between the depths of 7 and 37 m, by SCUBA divers. Five platforms were surveyed by Remotely Operated Vehicle (ROV) to depths of up to 117 m. T. micranthus was found on only one platform - Grand Isle 93 (GI-93), off Port Fourchon, Louisiana, near the Mississippi River mouth, at the cross-roads of two major safety fairways/shipping lanes transited by large international commercial ships. The introduction appears to be recent, probably derived from the ballast water or hull of a vessel from the Indo-Pacific. If the growth and reproductive rates of T. micranthus, both sexual and asexual, are similar to those of T. coccinea, this species could dominate this region like its congener.

On the basis of a 3D structural model, the main Pleistocene events could be reconstructed and correlated with stratigraphical records in the circum-Baltic area comprising Marine Isotope Stages (MIS) 6 to 2. The oldest till was deposited during the Late Saalian Warthe advance (qs2; c. 150-130ka). It is only preserved in ENE-WSW trending subglacial channels incised into Upper Cretaceous soft chalk. Isolated rafts and remnants of two Middle Weichselian tills occur locally, whereas Eemian interglacial sediments are missing. The older till (qw*) has an unusual fine gravel composition and might have formed during ice advances known only from northern Denmark and northern Poland (c.65-60ka). The younger till represents the Warnow advance (qw0) in NE Germany that can be correlated with the Danish Ristinge advance (c. 55-50ka). Furthermore, two tills deposited during the Late Weichselian Last Glacial Maximum (c. 24-16ka) occur. One can be correlated with the Pomeranian advance (qw2), while the other has characteristics typical for the Mecklenburg advance (qw3). These advances eroded older Pleistocene deposits, thus probably also removing the till of the Brandenburg/Frankfurt advance (qw1) - in contrast to the onshore areas. The Pomeranian till is limited to the southeast, close to the shallow Adlergrund, but the Mecklenburg till covers the whole study area.

The ichthyoarchaeological analysis of 4,282 fish bones resulted in the identification of individuals belonging to 24 families of Teleostei and Chondrichthyes, among which Carangidae (jacks) largely dominate, followed by Serranidae (groupers), Acanthuridae (surgeonfishes), Balistidae (triggerfishes), Lutjanidae (snappers), and Pomacentridae (damselfishes). All of the cranial and postcranial elements were examined, and the taxonomic determination led to genus and species level attributions whenever possible. The composition of the assemblage, the ecology of the taxa, the nature of the nearby marine biotopes, and the fishing gear unearthed on the site provided helpful data to characterise the probable fishing techniques used by the survivors. Although line fishing along the drop-off and offshore with a watercraft might have been practiced widely by the Malagasy slaves, spearing and/or harpooning on the sandbank and coral reef, as well as hand gathering in the tidal pools off the reef flat surrounding the island, could also have greatly contributed to the overall catch.

As climate change leads to warmer, more acidic, and less oxygenated oceans, species are shifting away from their historical distribution ranges, and these trends are expected to continue into the future. Correlative Species Distribution Models (SDMs) can be used to project future habitat extent for marine species, with many different statistical methods available. However, it is vital to assess how different statistical methods behave under novel environmental conditions before using these models for management advice, and to consider whether future projections based on these techniques are biologically reasonable. In this study, we built SDMs for adults and larvae of two ecologically important pelagic fishes in the California Current System (CCS): Pacific sardine (Sardinops sagax) and northern anchovy (Engraulis mordax). We used five different SDM methods, ranging from simple [thermal niche model (TNM)] to complex (artificial neural networks). Our results show that some SDMs trained on data collected between 2003 and 2013 lost substantial predictive skill when applied to observations from more recent years, when ocean temperatures associated with a marine heatwave were outside the range of historical measurements. This decrease in skill was particularly apparent for adult sardine, which showed non-stationary relationships between catch locations and sea surface temperature (SST) through time. While sardine adults and larvae shifted their distributions markedly during the marine heatwave, anchovy largely maintained their historical spatiotemporal distributions. Our results suggest that correlative relationships between species and their environment can become unreliable during anomalous conditions. Understanding the underlying physiology of marine species is therefore essential for the construction of SDMs that are robust to rapidly changing environments. Developing distribution models that offer skillful predictions into the future for species such as sardine and anchovy, which are migratory and include separate sub-stocks, may be particularly challenging.",,,,,,,,,42,1,0,0,34,0,44,,,,2296-7745,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Inst Marine Sci, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USANOAA, Southwest Fisheries Sci Ctr, San Diego, CA 92037 USANOAA, Southwest Fisheries Sci Ctr, Monterey, CA USABenchmark Labs, San Francisco, CA USANOAA, Earth Syst Res Lab, Boulder, CO USAPacific States Marine Fisheries Commiss, Newport, OR USANOAA, Northwest Fishenes Sci Ctr, Seattle, WA USA",Benchmark LabsPacific States Marine Fisheries Commiss,,,2020-07-29,WOS:000556184300001,,

To fully leverage the capacity of marine ecosystems to sequester carbon requires information to guide prioritisation of coastal landscapes for conservation and regeneration. A comprehensive landscape-scale assessment of mangrove and saltmarsh blue carbon requires information regarding vegetation cover, sedimentological and geomorphological factors. This information should also be integrated with socio-economic factors that alter natural processes of blue carbon accumulation and storage. The purpose of this study was to provide a framework for undertaking a first-pass assessment of blue carbon storage, preservation, generation and permanency in coastal landscapes, and to incorporate socio-economic factors that will influence blue carbon storage in coastal landscapes. This was achieved using readily available datasets that were analysed using a raster-based approach to develop a proxy indication of biophysical and socio-economic factors relevant for mangrove and saltmarsh blue carbon. The approach demonstrated that large catchments were associated with areas highly suitable for blue carbon storage, preservation, generation and permanency. Small catchments associated with mature barrier estuaries had the highest proportional area that provides potential blue carbon ecosystem services and climate mitigation benefits. The qualitative approach used does not replace high-resolution quantitative assessments of blue carbon storage, flux and detailed site-specific assessment of socio-economic factors that may influence blue carbon services; however, it can be used to guide prioritisation of blue carbon landscapes for further assessment prior to conservation and/or regeneration.",,,,,,,,,34,1,0,0,19,0,36,,,1862-4065,1862-4057,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Wollongong, Sch Earth & Environm Sci, Wollongong, NSW 2522, AustraliaDeakin Univ, Sch Life & Environm Sci, Melbourne, Vic 3125, AustraliaMacquarie Univ, Dept Environm Sci, Sydney, NSW 2109, Australia",,,,2019-03-19,WOS:000460361900013,,

Under the 2DG Scenario, carbon capture and storage (CCS) would contribute just under one-fifth of total emissions reductions by 2050.To enable CCS to contribute at the levels in the 2DG Scenario, rapid growth in the number CCS projects is needed between today and 2020, and then the number of projects must grow steadily through 2050. As well as being a major financial, technical and logistical challenge, this is a significant regulatory challenge.

Exploitation of both the phase (satellite radar interferometry, InSAR) and amplitude (speckle tracking) information from CSK images, taken along the acquisition orbit, Enhanced Spotlight (ES)-29, revealed a general movement of the translation of the vessel, consistent with sliding toward the east of the hull on the seabed.

Ecological restoration and species enhancement projects could be profitably used to test theoretically based predictions, but only if theory were first applied to develop quantitative predictions suitable for testing. Here, we review what is known about factors limiting population size and production of the American lobster Homarus americanus, and use that information to construct a demographic life-table model of population dynamics. We then use the model to evaluate alternative options for enhancing lobster population size and production. Because this species represents an example of a population subjected to intense human exploitation as a target of commercial fisheries, which has stimulated much research on its biology, demographic modeling is facilitated. Furthermore, intervention into the fishery provides a viable restoration option available only to exploited species. We apply the economic concept of discounting (of future pay-back in the form of restoration, analogous to being paid interest on a loan) to allow quantification of the scale of restoration needed to compensate for both the magnitude of the estimated loss of American lobsters and the time lags between loss and restoration following a major oil spill. Quantification of benefits is rarely performed for restoration projects to guide compensation for natural resource damages caused by environmental incidents. The methods and approach developed here can help address this past failure in order to provide compensating ecological and human services equal to those lost. The approach represents a significant step forward in conceptually and quantitatively addressing restoration needs. The methods may be applied to other species, especially those that are exploited by humans, but also others that can feasibly be restored to mitigate impacts of adverse environmental events.",,,,,,,,,25,2,0,0,20,0,31,,,0171-8630,1616-1599,,,,,,,,,,"Appl Sci Associates, Narragansett, RI 02882 USARhode Isl Dept Environm Management, Div Fish & Wildlife, Jamestown, RI 02835 USAUniv Rhode Isl, Dept Sci Biol, Kingston, RI 02881 USA",Appl Sci AssociatesRhode Isl Dept Environm Management,,,2003-01-01,WOS:000188586200016,,

In the study area, there are potential stratigraphic traps (submarine fans and channels of the Karaagac and Kesan Formations, fluvial channels of the Ficitepe Formation and reefs of the Sogucak Formation), potential fractured tuffs (the Gazikoy Formation) and, potential structural traps related to the folds, thrusts and the WPNAF. Although 17 exploration wells have been drilled in the study area and vicinity, no discovery has yet been made. The cause of this may be that the wells were terminated at depths shallower than potential targets or possibly drilling may have been terminated at the allochthonous block facies of the Gazikoy Formation, which is especially derived from ophiolite melange and was misidentified as basement.

J,,,,,,,,,"Plesniak, Michael",,Three-dimensional Separated Flows around a Bump Imbedded in a Boundary Layer with Pulsatile Freestream: Biofluid Dynamics of Phonation,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Awarded Grant,Aug 01 2012,2012,"1236351 Plesniak This investigation concerns the complicated unsteady (pulsatile) flow around a protuberance, such as encountered in polyps or nodules on the vocal folds. Despite its prevalence in engineering and biological flows, the previous work on flow separation from a hemispheroid-like object, or bump, on a wall has all been limited to steady freestream flow conditions, thus creating a significant void in the knowledge base. The overall objective of the investigation is to understand flow structures produced by three-dimensional flow separation in pulsatile flow over a 2:1 aspect ratio prolate hemispheroid on a wall. The outcomes of this work will provide insight not only into bioengineering flow applications, but also contribute to the broader topic of unsteady three-dimensional flow separation from smoothly-contoured objects on a boundary. It will be determined how flow structures interact with the wall in order to elucidate their impact on the shear stress and pressure signature on the wall both upstream and downstream of the protuberance. This secondary objective is of great importance because bioengineering flows are most concerned with fluid-structure interactions that elicit a biological response (e.g. pressure loadings that drive the dynamics of voiced speech, and wall shear stresses that have been linked to atherosclerosis). A suite of experimental investigations will be performed in a wind tunnel, utilizing time-resolved particle image velocimetry, laser Doppler anemometry, wall pressure measurements, skin friction line visualization, and oil-film interferometry, in order to resolve the separated flow morphologies, and their interaction with flow parameters of interest on the wall. The transformative potential of the proposed study is to facilitate the development of an unprecedented ability to design systems that take advantage of inherent features of unsteady 3-D separated flows. Detailed study and understanding of separated 3-D flows in pulsatile flows constitutes the intellectual merit of the proposed study. Vocal fold polyps and nodules are hemispheroidal protuberances that develop on the vocal folds, altering the fluid loading that drives voiced speech and produces sound. Magnetically-targeted drug delivery in the arteries results in hemispheroidal conglomerations on the arterial surface, disrupting the hemodynamics. In both scenarios, the protuberance interacts with a pulsatile flow field. Found not only in biomedical, but also engineering applications, pulsatile flow over a bump on a wall presents a fundamental fluid mechanics problem involving three-dimensional flow separation, complex vortex shedding patterns, and fluid-structure interactions along the downstream wall. The proposed research is applicable to the aforementioned examples of bioengineering flows, as well as to the broader case of flow separation from objects that are located in a buffeting wake (e.g. automobile and marine aerodynamics, wind turbine performance, etc.), and also to environmental flows and contaminant transport around hills and berms. The proposed research plan will achieve broader impacts by (1) benefiting engineering and societal environments, (2) increasing participation of undergraduates and underrepresented groups, and (3) K-12 outreach programs. Furthermore, the grant will facilitate the training of a Ph.D. student and a post-doctoral scholar. Dissemination of information will be achieved through scholarly publications, conference proceedings, and the archival of data on the PIs existing research website. Additionally, several mentoring activities for post-doctoral scientists, graduate, and high school students are underway.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,1236351,,,,,,,,George Washington University,,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:13988836,,

The spreading of seagrass seeds has been proven to be a successful method for restoring seagrass around the world, however in places where tidal range is large such methods become limited by resultant water movements. Here we describe and test a method for deploying seagrass seeds of the species Zostera marina over large scales using a new, simple method Bags of Seagrass Seeds Line (BoSSLine). This method involved planting seeds and sediment using natural fiber hessian bags deployed along strings anchored onto the seabed. When deployed in a suitable environment 94% of bags developed mature seagrass shoots, unfortunately one site subjected to a large storm event resulted in sediment burial of the bags and no seed germination. Bags were filled with 100 seeds with each leading to the development of 2.37 +/- 2.41 mature shoots (206 +/- 87 mm in length) 10 months after planting. The method was proven successful however the experiments illustrated the need to ensure habitat suitability prior to their use. Low seed success rate was comparable to other restoration studies, however further trials are recommended to ensure ways to improve this rate.

For the UK, a sea-level rise of up to 1m is expected this century, together with wetter winters that will change river behaviour - drastically increasing flood risk and terrestrial fluxes of freshwater, nutrients, sediments, microplastics and harmful bacteria to the ocean. Urban development of flood-prone areas and intensification of catchment land use (e.g. deforestation) can further alter river flow/load behaviours and extenuate the risks.

Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) have been implemented as a conservation tool throughout the world, primarily as a measure to reduce local impacts, but their usefulness and effectiveness is strongly related to climate change. MPAs may have a role in mitigation through effects on carbon sequestration, affect interactions between climatic effects and other drivers and be affected themselves as the distributions of protected species change over time. However, to date, few MPA programmes have directly considered climate change in the design, management or monitoring of an MPA network. This paper presents a series of international case studies from four locations: British Columbia, Canada; central California, USA; the Great Barrier Reef, Australia and the Hauraki Gulf, New Zealand; to review perceptions of how climate change has been considered in the design, implementation, management and monitoring of MPAs. The results indicate that some MPA processes have already incorporated design criteria or principles for adaptive management, which address some of the potential impacts of climate change on MPAs. Key lessons include: i) Strictly protected marine reserves are considered essential for climate change resilience and will be necessary as scientific reference sites to understand climate change effects ii) Adaptive management of MPA networks is important but hard to implement iii) Strictly protected reserves managed as ecosystems are the best option for an uncertain future. Although the case studies addressed aspects of considering climate change within MPA networks and provided key lessons for the practical inclusion of these considerations, there are some significant challenges remaining. This paper provides new insights into the policy and practical challenges MPA managers face under climate change scenarios. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Previous efforts acquired a high-resolution 3D seismic dataset (P-cableT') and interpreted a seismically discontinuous zone as shallow gas pockets (< 100 m below seafloor) associated with a vertical chimney structure. Our approach was to measure hydrocarbon concentrations and stable carbon isotopes near the seafloor to assess if gas migrated vertically from seismic anomalies. Deep-sourced thermogenic hydrocarbons would indicate that the structure is transmissive which could indicate an unacceptable risk for GCS at the site. Alternatively, hydrocarbons formed in-situ from biogenic processes would not preclude transmissivity of the structure but would add information to the risk assessment. Gases were extracted from 23 piston core samples recovered between 2.56 and 3.50 m subseafloor. Light hydrocarbons and stable carbon isotopes of methane were used for source attribution. The result was that geochemical signatures were consistent with typical background values observed within the first few meters of subsea sediment and therefore did not indicate leakage from depth.

As a species rich marine environment, Ireland's waters are also an important habitat for many species of marine mammal. Specifically, grey seals (Halichoerus grypus) and harbour seals (Phoca vitulina) are widespread in Irish coastal waters and at least 24 species of cetacean have been reported at sea. The coastal zone represents critical habitat for many of these species, in particular seals that use both terrestrial and aquatic coastal habitat and are vulnerable to habitat degradation. Increasing exploitation of marine resources has increased their exposure to a range of anthropogenic effects including pollution and habitat loss. As top predators seals interact with commercial fisheries both directly and indirectly for resources and conflicts arise. The relatively recent move towards 'greener' resource exploitation such as marine renewable energy does not come without negative consequences for marine mammals including seals, which are afforded protection under national and international conservation legislation, highlighting the difficulties faced by resource managers. The sustainable exploitation of resources whilst conserving biodiversity is a challenging task and effective management implementation depends on appropriate policy informed by reliable scientific data. This paper outlines the conservation needs of seals in Irish waters, reviews our current knowledge of these species in Irish water, provides a critical analysis of the existing legislative, framework and describes how research outputs can inform present and future policy decisions.

In addition, the funding will facilitate participation of 10 invited speakers and panelists who would otherwise be unlikely to attend the conference. The Thermal and Fluids Engineering Conference (TFEC) is an annual conference since 2015 that has grown to become a leading platform for presentation and discussion of research advances in thermal and fluids engineering. In 2020, the conference will take place April 5-8, 2020 in New Orleans, LA. The annual TFEC conference addresses the need for a platform for dissemination and discussion of research results in the fields of heat transfer and fluid mechanics. A number of sessions encompassing the breadth of thermal and fluid transport are currently being organized for the conference. The proposed NSF support will enable a significant intellectual benefit and professional development opportunity for a number of students and early career engineers/faculty from around the country. The participation of invited speakers and panelists enabled by the support will enhance and broaden the technical content of the conference, thereby benefiting all attendees. It is expected that this travel grant will focus research collaborations in multiple areas related to heat transfer and fluids engineering. The in-person platform offered by the conference is expected to lead to interesting and fruitful technical conversations. It is expected that this will lead to novel, collaborative approaches for addressing fundamental and applied problems in thermal and fluids engineering. <br/><br/>Thermal and fluids engineering effects a very broad spectrum of the industry and life in general. Advances in this field enabled by the conference may help improve and optimize a large number of applications that benefit the entire society in general. Some examples of applications to be discussed at TFEC include wind turbines, fuel cells, industrial processes, biomedicine, etc. Full papers and extended abstracts for TFEC are published by Begell House in the form of a conference proceeding. This set of papers are compiled and made available on the Begell House website. This will result in broad dissemination of research results presented at the conference. Given that the conference is being held in New Orleans, keynote presentations and other activities will be organized to introduce the audience to local issues of relevance to thermal/fluids engineering, such as water management of river, flood, and hurricane-induced wave interactions between ocean, bayous, canals, lakes, and waterways. Furthermore, the thermal-fluid science and engineering community will be introduced to the success stories of various local entrepreneurial efforts in bio-science/engineering in New Orleans area. By striving to ensure significant representation of minorities and women among the travel grant beneficiaries, the conference organizers will ensure that minorities and women specifically benefit from the conference.

Learning from the development and coastal impact of the existing port infrastructure in West Africa, the application of sand as a construction material for marine infrastructure seemed very obvious. Along this coast, ports experience heavy sedimentation at the western updrift side of the breakwaters, leading to the rapid burying of valuable armour rock. The Sandbar Breakwater concept is based on this principle by using natural accretion as the basis for the port protection. Such a concept is advantageous as a large sediment drift naturally supplements the sand filling works during construction and the required rock volumes are reduced significantly, saving construction time and minimising the environmental impact.

Through the application of semi-structured interviews, we investigated the local ecological knowledge of seven fishermen specialist on catching E. itajara from the Babitonga bay, Santa Catarina, Brazil. Local long-line fisheries for E. itajara seemed to be a disappearing tradition in the studied site, with a detailed inherent local ecological knowledge system, which is also being lost. Our study also showed that fishermen engaged in recent fisheries, such as spear-fishing, can also possess a detailed local ecological knowledge system. Through the analysis of fishermen local ecological knowledge, several aspects of E. itajara life history were registered. This species is found in the inner and outer Babitonga bay, from saline waters to areas with a large input of freshwater, and inhabits submerged wooden substrates and artificial reefs such as shipwrecks, mooring pillars and cargo containers. It is known to spawn in December and subsequent summer months in the studied area. Spawning aggregations are usually seen in December (during full moon), being also eventually observed in January and February by our informants. While lobsters, spadefishes and octopuses seem to constitute the most important food items of inner bay E. itajara, outer bay individuals may feed on catfishes, crustaceans and other fish species. The goliath grouper is regarded as pacific and curious fish, but frequently display agonistic behavior in the presence of divers. Based on the perception of well experienced spear fishermen, we hypothesize that E. itajara undertakes seasonal migrations from the inner to the outer bay during summer, and that the studied population is suffering from growth over-fishing.

At present, Guangdong's low-carbon roadmap emphasizes the adjustment of industrial structure, increased energy saving and efficiency, and renewable and nuclear energy, while CCS is not featured. This is partially due to the geographical gap in the existing body of research on CCS in China, as to date no substantial research on CCS has taken place in the regions south of the Yangtze River, including Guangdong.This paper presents the partial outcome of the first CCS-related research in Guangdong, which is aiming for a preliminary assessment on the effective CO2 storage capacity in the Pearl River Mouth Basin (PRMB) offshore Guangdong. As the storage capacity onshore Guangdong is limited as shown by a parallel study, the offshore sedimentary basins deserve particular attention. The PRMB is the largest sedimentary basin in the passive margin of the northern South China Sea, with a total area of nearly 200 000 km(2) and maximum sediment thickness of over 14 km. Based on published data, geological conditions and parameters for CO2 storage are analyzed, volumes of potential formations are calculated on a GIS platform, and the storage capacity is calculated according to CSLF and USDOE formulations. The estimated effective storage capacity is 308 Gt in deep saline formations, including 0.06 Gt in oil and gas fields. This capacity is sufficiently large for storaging the CO2 emitted from the major point sources in Guangdong in many decades. Promising areas are suggested for further investigations.

Healthy coral communities were observed at all sites >20 km from the Macondo well, including seven sites previously visited in September 2009, where the corals and communities appeared unchanged. However, at one site 11 km southwest of the Macondo well, coral colonies presented widespread signs of stress, including varying degrees of tissue loss, sclerite enlargement, excess mucous production, bleached commensal ophiuroids, and covering by brown flocculent material (floc). On the basis of these criteria the level of impact to individual colonies was ranked from 0 (least impact) to 4 (greatest impact).

Because of the importance of these impacts and of climate change itself, there has been a great deal of recent research, which has added to the evidence base. This review draws on recent research to summarise advances since the IPCC AR4 in our understanding of the impacts of climate change on biodiversity. The evidence for these impacts comes from three principal sources: direct observation, experimental studies and modelling studies. The main lesson from recent research is that many of the key findings at the time of IPCC AR4 have been strengthened, with a greater range of evidence, including observational evidence, to support them. While there are some specific areas where new understanding has emerged or the balance of evidence has shifted, the larger scale picture is one of increased support for earlier findings The IPCC AR4 described the evidence for the effects of climate change on natural ecosystems.More recent observ- ational, experimental and modelling work has pointed to several broad types of major changes to ecosystems as a result of climate change. Modelling studies combined with experimental evidence of species tolerances point to significant changes in the distribution of some ecosystems, principally due to increasing temperature and altered precipitation regimes. Likely distribution changes include poleward shifts, especially in non-equatorial regions, and upwards shifts in montane systems, where lack of space at higher altitudes may cause some systems to disappear entirely. Ecosystemdistribution changes are also expected to be large and more complex in the tropics, where the effects of rising temperatures and reduced precipitation are exacerbated by the effects of land-use change. Drier conditions are expected to cause savanna ecosystems to move into equatorial regions now occupied by forests. In addition to shifting their locations climate change will alter the composition of many ecosystems. Site level reductions in species richness are of concern because under changing environmental conditions,multiple species play a role in ensuring that ecosystem processes can continue. Processes potentially dependent on species richness include carbon storage. Climate change can also facilitate the spread and establishment of invasive species,which can havemajor impacts on ecosystem composition. Changes in species composition can lead to changes in the physical and trophic structure of ecosystems, with resulting further effects on system function and composition. One such change is the invasion of temperate grasslands by woody plants. In other systems, trees may disappear as a result of drought. Coral reefs are especially subject to adverse impacts from climate change due to bleaching and diseases promoted by warmer temperatures and increasing pressures fromocean acidification.Many reef-building coral species are threatened with extinction. This has major implications for the large biological communities that coral reefs support. A key property of ecosystems that may be affected by climate change is the values and services they provide to people. These include provisioning services such as fisheries, which may improve in the short term in boreal regions and decline elsewhere, and timber production, where the response depends on population characteristics aswell as local conditions andmay include large production losses. The impacts on coral reefs threaten the vital ecosystemservices these systems provide through fisheries, coastal protection and building materials. Climate change also affects the ability of terrestrial ecosystems to regulate water flow, and critically reduces the ability of many different ecosystems to sequester and/or retain carbonwhich can feedback to climate change. Modelling and experim- ental studies suggest that ecosystem function may change due to the combined effect of climate change and changes in ecosystem composition and structure. Furthermore, models suggest that global net primary production (NPP) has already increased in response to changes in temperature and precipitation during the 20th century. Regional modelling projects increases in NPP for some regions, but possible declines in others. At the species level, recent observed evidence shows that climate change has already caused changes to the distribution of many plants and animals. Models of future climate change suggest that these distributional changes may lead to severe range contractions and the extinction of some species. Changes occurring for terrestrial species include shifts in spring events (for example, leaf unfolding, flowering date,migration and time of reproduction), species distributions and community structure. In marine ecosystems changes have been demonstrated in functioning and productivity, including shifts from cold-adapted to warm-adapted communities, phenological changes and alterations in species interactions. Some species are unable to disperse or adapt fast enough to keep up with high rates of climate change and these species face increased extinction risk and, as a result, whole ecosystems, such as cloud forests and coral reefs,may cease to function in their current form. The IPCCAR4 estimated that 20-30 per cent of species assessed would be at risk of extinction if climate change leads to global average temperature rises greater than 1.5-2.5[degree]C. Recent work further suggests that a greater percentage of species may be at risk from climate change. Climate change is likely to affect ecological interactions, including competition, disease and host-parasite inter- actions, pollination, predator-prey interactions and herbivory. There is ample evidence that warming will alter the patterns of plant, animal and human diseases. Numerous modelling studies project increases in economically important plant pathogens with warming, and experimental studies show similar patterns. There is evidence that climate change may play a role in changing the distribution of diseases. Short-term, local experiments have demonstrated the impacts of predicted global change on plant health including rice. Differences in phenological response to climate change between plants and pollinatorsmay significantly affect their interactions and could lead to their extinction. Despite its importance, relatively little effort has yet been devoted to investigating the impacts of climate change on genetic diversity. One clear impact is the fragmentation of populations when their habitats are fragmented by climate change. There may also be impacts on crop wild relatives, which are an important source of genetic diversity for crop diversity. Climate change impacts on ecosystems and the species within can exert significant positive feedbacks to the climate system. It is generally agreed that one of themain feedbacks to the climate system will be through the increase in soil respiration under increased temperature, particularly in the Arctic, with the potential to add 200ppm CO2 to the atmosphere by 2100.One area of research that has expanded since theAR4 is that of the projectedAmazon drying and dieback. Although there is still considerable uncertainty,mostmodels predict reduced precipitation leading to increased drying of the Amazon rainforest. It has been suggested that CO2 emissions will be accelerated by up to 66 per cent due to feedbacks arising from global soil carbon loss and forest dieback in Amazonia as a consequence of climate change. Global scale climate scenario modelling suggests that the terrestrial biosphere will become a carbon source by 2100, largely due to the increased soil respiration and the dieback of the Amazon, whereas it is thought that currently ecosystems are acting as a carbon sink sequestering 30 per cent of anthropogenic emissions. Onmethodological questions,many of the studies reviewed here rely on experimental or modelled evidence of climate change impacts. Both of these simulate the biodiversity impacts of climate change in more or less realistic ways. Experimental studies are limited by the number of factors that can be manipulated simultaneously. Multi-factorial experiments may capture interactions more realistically. Most modelling studies are correlative and outputs from such studies are dependent on the choice of explanatory variables considered, with many studies only considering climatic variables. Given the importance of other factors such as land-use change in determining impacts, there is a strong case for building such factors intomodels in order to predict climate change impacts more accurately.",,,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,,,1683-6820; 1683-6839,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2011-05-03,ZOOREC:ZOOR14705042287,,

Even if the overall procedure is considered safe, the effects of potential seepage must be addressed in order to develop a reliable risk assessment of the process.This study focuses on the effects of CO2 seepage on the chemistry of sediments and on the overlying water column in shallow-water environments. To study these effects, an experimental rig was designed, fabricated, and tested. The main unit of the rig is a transparent Plexiglas vertical cylindrical vessel that can be filled with sediment in the bottom section and water in the upper part. CO2 is injected as gas from the bottom through nozzles fed by a CO2 cylinder. Sensors are used to monitor the variation of the main physical and chemical properties of water and sediments. Gas, water, and sediment samples can be collected for further analysis.The results highlight a fast response of the system to the injected CO2 with a sharp reduction of the pH values of the interstitial water inside the sediments; once the injection stops, a recovery toward the initial values is recorded. The water above the sediment is also affected by the presence of CO2; in this case the gas-water interaction is controlled by the water movements induced by the rising bubble column.

However, Vietnam's mangroves have been lost in recent decades (similar to 38%) or degraded, predominantly driven by herbicides during the Vietnam War and later by conversion to aquaculture and coastal development, although there has been a recent slowing of this degradation as a result of restoration and protection schemes. This review article discusses the principal factors which influence mangroves in Vietnam including climate and climate change, hydrology, soil and topography, and anthropogenic factors such as aquaculture expansion, illegal logging, damming, pollution), which requires special attention. We further discuss the important role that Vietnamese mangrove forests play an in the socio-economic development of the country, even though the exploitation and protection of mangrove forests in many provinces are often uncontrolled. We discuss successful management practices including co-management models for mangrove restoration, which have been a success in Vietnam. Conservation and rehabilitation process of mangrove forests by various national and international agencies are still on-going and the success of such activities is influenced by various socio-economic, political as well as environmental factors. Further challenges in effective mangrove management arise due to climate change, which accelerates high atmospheric CO2, increased air temperature, sea level rise, storminess, ocean currents and alterations in precipitation regime. Recent developments in remote sensing applications can be utilized to improve the mapping and monitoring the changes in mangrove ecosystems in Vietnam thereby improving the effective management of mangrove forests.",,,,,,,,,75,3,0,0,41,0,78,,,0272-7714,1096-0015,,,,,,,,,,"Ton Duc Thang Univ, Dept Management Sci & Technol Dev, Ho Chi Minh City, VietnamTon Duc Thang Univ, Fac Environm & Labour Safety, Ho Chi Minh City, VietnamUniv Brighton, Sch Environm & Technol, Ctr Aquat Environm, Cockcroft Bldg, Brighton BN2 4GJ, E Sussex, EnglandEstonian Univ Life Sci, Inst Agr & Environm Sci, Kreutzwaldi 5, EE-51014 Tartu, EstoniaVietnam Acad Sci & Technol, Inst Trop Biol, Dept Environm Management & Technol, Ho Chi Minh City, VietnamVietnam Acad Sci & Technol, Grad Univ Sci & Technol, Hanoi, VietnamUniv Social Sci & Humanities, VNU HCM, Dept Geog, Ho Chi Minh City, VietnamSouther Subinst Fisheries Econ & Planning, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam",Souther Subinst Fisheries Econ & Planning,,,2019-03-05,WOS:000459519700022,,

In marine biology this concept has been summarized as shifting baselines in which each generation accepts a degradation of the environment and perceives it to be natural. Carbon storage, rates of growth, vegetation succession, and potential biodiversity all are important components of ecosystem services modified by human actions. Sometimes societal changes enhance one process at the cost of another. Historically, water retention may have been paramount in a dry setting like the high Andes, but when faced with global climate change, carbon storage may become more pressing. Efforts by policy makers to grapple with climate change and loss of biodiversity increases the need for deeper understand of the trajectory of landscape change and for clearer identification of what is natural. This research project will investigate an area of very high biodiversity in the Peruvian Andes, where efforts to conserve Andean habitats to promote both biodiversity and carbon sequestration are being undertaken in a landscape that has been manipulated for millennia by humans. Present plans for high elevation carbon sequestration center around Polylepis, a tree that can grow at higher altitudes than any other. Woodlands of this tree are important habitat for endemic species. While efforts to expand forests are fueled by the belief that Polylepis was once much more abundant than present, this hypothesis has not been tested. The investigators will define natural baselines for ecosystems across a range of elevations, determine the natural height of tree line (important for above-ground carbon storage), and the trajectory of landscape change relative to climate change for the last 11,000 years. The researchers will analyze sediment cores from ten lakes and 200 soil cores to provide the historical data to establish these natural baselines, and they will investigate how climate change interacted with human activity to produce altered fire regimes, crop use, and forest cover. Paleoecology can, through analysis of fossil pollen and charcoal recovered from soils and lake sediments, provide detailed information about how systems have changed. The early Holocene climate (from roughly. 11,000 years to 9,000 years before the present) was quite similar to that of today, but human populations in the Andes were very low. This period therefore offers insights into the Andean ecosystem without human activity. Forming regional conservation policy with regard to local land use or even global carbon budgets requires an understanding of the trajectory of human influence on ecosystems. This project will provide new data on the timing, extent, and nature of human-induced change in Andean landscapes and provide baseline data relevant to ongoing efforts to constrain the effects of climate change through carbon sequestration while conserving biodiversity. Collaborations with scientists in complimentary disciplines (soil science, plant physiology, ecology, and remote sensing) will permit project results to be integrated into a larger prediction of appropriate policy for Andean conservation and for attempts to mitigate carbon release within Andean ecosystems.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,926973,,,,,,,,Florida Institute of Technology,,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:13914820,,

A comparative assessment was made of the non-financial (especially environmental) outcomes of the different scenarios, with the reference scenario being to leave all structures in situ, while other scenarios envisaged leaving them on the seabed or removing them to shore for recycling and disposal. The costs of each scenario, when compared with the reference scenario, give an implicit valuation of the non-financial outcomes (e.g. environmental improvements), should that scenario be adopted by society. The paper concludes that it is not clear that the removal of the topsides and jackets of large steel structures to shore, as currently required by regulations, is environmentally justified; that concrete structures should certainly be left in place; and that leaving footings, cuttings and pipelines in place, with subsequent monitoring, would also be justified unless very large values were placed by society on a clear seabed and trawling access.

Two main contributors to azimuth uncertainty are magnetic disturbances from electric currents in the ionosphere and axial magnetic interference from the drillstring. The former is more frequent in the Barents Sea than farther south, and the effect of the latter is increased because of diminished value of the magnetic horizontal component. Wellbore directional surveying for operations on the continental shelf in the North Sea and the Norwegian Sea rely on well-established procedures for near-real-time magnetic monitoring by use of onshore magnetic-reference stations. The different land and sea configuration, distant offshore oil and gas fields, higher geomagnetic latitude, and different behavior of the magnetic field require the procedures to be reassessed before being applied to the Barents Sea. To reduce drilling delays, procedures must be implemented to enable efficient management of magnetic disturbances. In some areas of the Barents Sea, the management requires new equipment to be developed and tested before drilling, such as seabed magnetometer stations. One simple way to reduce drillstring interference is increasing the amount of nonmagnetic steel in the bottomhole assembly (BHA). To maintain azimuth uncertainty at an acceptable level in northern areas, it is crucial that wellbore-directional-surveying requirements are given high priority and considered early during well planning. During the development phase of an oil and gas field, the planned wells must be assigned adequate positional-uncertainty models and, if possible, be designed in a direction that minimizes the wellbore directional uncertainty.",,,,,,,,,3,1,0,0,0,0,4,,,1064-6671,1930-0204,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Tromso, N-9001 Tromso, NorwayStatoil ASA, Stavanger, NorwayUniv Tromso, TGO, N-9001 Tromso, NorwayUniv Tromso, N-9001 Tromso, NorwayTech Univ Denmark, Odense, Denmark",,,,2014-08-20,WOS:000339554400007,,

We examined potential oceanographic drivers behind this decline both within and north of the CalCOFI survey area in order to capture upstream processes as well. Empirical orthogonal function (EOF) analyses using output from a data-assimilative regional ocean model revealed significant relationships between the fish time series and spatial patterns of upwelling, upper ocean heat content and eddy kinetic energy in the CCS. Correlation and linear regression analyses indicated that the declining trend in fish abundance was correlated with a suite of factors: reduced offshore and increased inshore upwelling; a long term warming trend combined with more recent interannual variability in ocean temperature; weaker eddy kinetic energy north of Point Conception (35 degrees N), potentially indicating reduced transport of the California Current (CC); increased influence of the California Undercurrent (CUC); and a decline in zooplankton displacement volume across the southern CCS.

Species selection is mostly based on growth rate and convenience in planting. In this study, to compare the quantity and quality of carbon stored in soil, four habitats were selected in Haijiang River Estuary, southern China to assess the contribution by different mangrove species to sediment carbon pool. Two 12-year-old mangrove forests of the exotic Sonneratia apetala and native Kandelia obovata, respectively, and the adjacent sandflat and mudflat as unvegetated referencing sites had been studied. The total sedimentary organic carbon and active sedimentary organic content in sediment suggested that after 12 years of growth, (1) mangrove forests significantly increased the organic carbon content of sediment; (2) total organic carbon in the K. obovata forest was higher than that of the S. apetala forest; but (3) the carbon pool of the K. obovata forest was less stable than that of the S. apetala forest. These results corroborated with other studies that the sediment carbon pool of S. apetala forests reached a stable state after 13 years of growth, while that of K. obovata forests gradually stabilised upon long-term (>13 years) growth. Our study confirms that K. obovata is more conducive to capture carbon in long-term mangrove reforestation projects, demonstrating that the provision of this service may not be directly related to apparently relevant plant traits such as growth rate.

Placing a value on these changes helps articulate the importance of the carbon storage service to society. The standing stock and fluxes of organic and inorganic carbon from the atmosphere, rivers, shelves and through the gateways linking to lower latitudes, and to the deep of the Arctic Ocean are investigated using the physically chemically biologically coupled SINMOD model. To obtain indications of the effect of climate change, trajectories of two IPCC climate scenarios RCP 4.5, and RCP 8.5 from the Max Planck Institute were used for the period 2006-2099. The results show an increase in the net carbon storage in the Arctic Ocean in this time period to be 1.0 and 2.3% in the RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5 scenarios, respectively. Most of this increase is caused by an increased atmospheric CO2 uptake until 2070. The continued increase in inorganic carbon storage between 2070 and 2099 results from increased horizontal influx from lower latitude marine regions. First estimates of carbon storage values in the Arctic Ocean are calculated using the social cost of carbon (SCC) and carbon market values as two outer bounds from 2019 to 2099, based on the simulated scenarios. We find the Arctic Ocean will over the time period studied increase its storage of carbon to a value of between (sic)27.6 billion and (sic)1 trillion. This paper clearly neglects a multitude of different negative consequences of climate change in the Arctic, but points to the fact that there are also some positive counterbalancing effects.",,,,,,,,,11,0,0,0,7,0,11,,,,2296-7745,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Tromso, Arctic Univ Norway, Norwegian Coll Fishery Sci, Tromso, NorwaySINTEF Ocean, Trondheim, NorwayInst Marine Res, Fram Ctr, Tromso, NorwayUniv Tromso, Arctic Univ Norway, Dept Arctic & Marine Biol, Tromso, Norway",,,,2019-07-09,WOS:000472620200001,,

Mangrove wetlands contribute up to 15% of the coastal sediment carbon storage and similar to 10% of the particulate terrestrial carbon exported to the ocean. Thus, mercury (Hg) methylation in mangrove sediments and subsequent MeHg output to adjacent waters could have a great impact on global Hg cycling. In this review, we provide a comprehensive analysis of the literature on worldwide Hg concentrations in mangrove ecosystems, and the results reveal that a large range of total Hg (THg) and MeHg concentrations is detected in mangrove systems. Then, we discuss the potential roles of organic matter (OM) in controlling the Hg biogeochemistry in mangrove sediments. The intense OM decomposition by anoxic reduction (e.g., sulfate reduction) drastically affects sediment chemistries, such as redox potential, pH, and sulfur speciation, all of which may have a great impact on MeHg production. While the outwelling of carbon from mangroves has been extensively examined, little is known about their roles in exporting MeHg to adjacent waters. Our understanding of Hg biogeochemical processes in mangrove systems is constrained by the limited MeHg data and a lack of in-depth studies on the Hg methylation potential in this ecologically important environment. More efforts are needed to gain better insights into the contributions mangrove wetlands to the global Hg cycle. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

We quantified predation of loggerhead turtle eggs by two species of goanna, Varanus panoptes and Varanus varius, at Wreck Rock beach, one of the turtle's major nesting beaches. In addition, we conducted an experiment to determine the efficacy of a nest protection device. Predation rates at Wreck Rock beach were 15.2% for treatment and 45.8% for non-treatment clutches during the 2013-2014 nesting season.

Although nests were only partially predated (16.4% of the total number of eggs), nest loss to predators and beach erosion (caused by a cyclone) was 91.7%. If left unmanaged, the cumulative impact of predation and other threats, including those exacerbated by climate change, can cause unsustainable loss of loggerhead turtle nests. This study provides one of the first quantitative data sets on rates of loggerhead turtle clutch predation in the South Pacific.

Resulting depositional models highlight the complex distribution of depositional environments, and reflect spatial and temporal variations in physical processes at the shoreline, rate of sediment supply and accommodation development. These models are further complicated by the absence of coastal plain facies, which implies that the Troll Field was fully subaqueous during deposition, that shoreline regression was forced by falling sea level or that coastal plain deposits were removed by transgression. Genetic sequences bounded by major flooding surfaces ('series') exhibit laterally uniform thicknesses, implying no major tectonic influence on sedimentation.

To reach sustainability in the wider sense the common society has to meet the 7 tenets - that management actions have to be environmentally sustainable, economically viable, technologically feasible, socially desirable (or at least tolerable), legally permissible, administratively achievable and politically expedient. Each of these are explained and discussed using examples from the two seas including pollution control, physical resource exploitation (such as aggregates, habitat loss, renewable energy and oil and gas), and biological resources exploitation (fisheries and aquaculture). This paper discusses the similarities between the areas in terms of their management regimes, population in the catchment, history of anthropogenic changes, derivation of objectives against a wealth of information and understanding, and the history of management and control. In contrast, the differences between the areas centre on their differing hydrographic regimes, including residence and flushing times, biological features, nature of the pollutants discharged, dominant types of fishing and type of control indicated by a predominant Eastern Bloc for the Baltic as opposed to European Union control in the North Sea. The review ends with an assessment of future challenges and examples of the way in which environmental problems have been addressed in the two areas. In particular, it sets the features against a background of management designed to achieve the Ecosystem Approach within the prevailing European marine management framework. (c) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Its pronounced morphologic features protect coastal recreation facilities located behind the reef. To provide a basis for evaluating the role of the fringing coral reef in protecting marinas and sandy beaches against waves and currents, a two-dimensional (2D) numerical model SIMulating Wastal PROcess (SIMCOPRO) was applied with its three main modules including wave, current and sediment. The selected study area is located at Sahl Hasheesh coast south of Hurghada on the west coast of the Red Sea at a site proposed for the construction of a marina. The model offers insight in how the reef system modifies the wave and current fields. The application of the model in the presence of a marina reveals insignificant erosion on the downdrift side of the marina breakwaters (south of the southern breakwater). The erosion is expected to be 1 m after the first year, 2 m after the next 5 years and no further change for a period of 10 years. This is because the rocky reefal beachface will be exposed and erosion of sand will be diminished. The minor local erosion is controlled by the protective response of coral reef, the very limited coarse sand on the beachface ( < 0.5 m thick), the weak current induced by waves (0.13 m/s) and other topographic protective elements in the region. The submerged/emerged geometric nature of the reefal system, both reef flat and reef crest, allow wave dissipation and thus behaves as a submerged breakwater to protect marinas or artificial beaches in the shelter zone of this reef. An important lesson to be learned from this study is that improper construction practices of building marinas can seriously hurt the environment. The dredging of artificial reef lagoons is one improper practice that would create unexpected beach erosion. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V.

Unfortunately, these areas also receive pollutants released into oceanic and riverine waters. Six years following the Deepwater Horizon oil spill, the largest in US history, the complexity of ecological injuries in this system is just now being elucidated. Here, we describe a novel pathway of injury from oil spills by documenting how the loss of oysters near marsh edge as a direct result of shoreline oiling and clean-up activities can double rates of coastal erosion. As part of the natural resource damage assessment, we examined the impact of shoreline oiling on eastern oysters Crassostrea virginica near the marsh edge at 187 sites in Louisiana and Mississippi Sound in 2013. For marshes that experienced heavy oiling, oyster habitat was 77% less abundant than in areas where no oil was observed. Areas near marshes characterized by more moderate levels of oiling had 33% less oyster habitat than areas where no oil was observed. Similarly, the number of sites without any oyster habitat was higher in heavily and persistently oiled areas compared to areas where no oil was observed (56 vs. 24%). The consequences of this loss are substantial and include loss of essential fish habitat, reduced nutrient cycling, and decreased erosion buffering. For a subset of the sites where erosion rate was also measured between 2010 and 2013 (n = 79), shoreline loss was more than twice as high (2.1 vs. 0.9 m yr(-1)) in areas lacking oyster cover. Our findings provide evidence that loss of nearshore oyster habitat can disrupt the strong facilitation between oysters and marsh vegetation.",,,,,,,,,12,0,0,0,9,0,13,,,0171-8630,1616-1599,,,,,,,,,,"Univ S Alabama, Dept Marine Sci, 101 Bienville Blvd, Dauphin Isl, AL 36528 USADauphin Isl Sea Lab, 101 Bienville Blvd, Dauphin Isl, AL 36528 USANewFields Inc, 1349 W Peachtree St,Suite 2000, Atlanta, GA 30309 USANOAA, Assessment & Restorat Div, 7600 Sand Point Way NE, Seattle, WA 98115 USAInd Econ Inc, 2067 Massachusetts Ave, Cambridge, MA 02140 USANortheastern Univ, Marine Sci Ctr, 430 Nahant Rd, Nahant, MA 01908 USAUniv Louisiana, Dept Biol, Lafayette, LA 70504 USA",NewFields Inc,,,2017-09-12,WOS:000407443900015,,

It is accompanied by discharges of naturally occurring radionuclides raising concerns over the potential radiological impacts of produced water on marine biota. In the Northern European marine environment, radioactivity in produced water has received substantial attention owing to the OSPAR Radioactive Substances Strategy which aims at achieving 'concentrations in the environment near background values for naturally occurring radioactive substances'. This review provides an overview of published research on the impacts to biota from naturally occurring radionuclides discharged in produced water by the offshore oil and gas industry. In addition to summarising studies and data that deal directly with the issue of dose and effect, the review also considers studies related to the impact of added chemicals on the fate of discharged radionuclides. The review clearly illustrates that only a limited number of studies have investigated possible impacts on biota from naturally occurring radionuclides present in produced water. Hence, although these studies indicate that the risk to the environment from naturally occurring radionuclides discharged in produced water is negligible, the substantial uncertainties involved in the assessments of impact make it difficult to be conclusive. With regard to the complexity involved in the problem under consideration there is a pressing need to supplement existing data and acquire new knowledge. Finally, the present work identifies some knowledge gaps to indicate future research requirements. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Evaluation of the hazards of harmful substances carried by ships (Working Group 1): More hazardous chemicals are being listed and evaluated: 1. GESAMP has revised its evaluation criteria for hazardous chemicals. 2. Copies of the next edition of the International Maritime Organization's Composite List, containing 2,500 hazard profiles of substances transported at sea, will be made available to member States of UNEP's Regional Seas Programme. II. Environmental impacts of coastal aquaculture (Working Group 31): As the aquaculture industry grows, so too does the use of chemicals: 1. Some of the chemicals used in coastal aquaculture include: antibacterial agents, feed additives, hormones, pesticides, soil and water treatments. 2. Chemicals originally developed for use on food crops and in livestock production are now being used in aquaculture. 3. An overview on chemical usage was prepared, with the goal of protecting coastal environments and their living resources, human health and the sustainability of the aquaculture sector. 4. Although intended to enhance coastal aquaculture, chemical usage may actually cause problems. Examples include: difficulties of effluent treatment; trade difficulties arising from drug residue monitoring and enforcement programmes; potential loss of efficacy because of prophylactic use of antibacterials; and lack of alternatives to chemotherapy use. 5. Evaluating and quantifying the risks associated with aquacultural chemicals is complicated by a lack of quantitative data on chemical use as well as lack of field data. Available data relates primarily to temperate regions with little information 'on tropical areas. 6. Most countries have little or no data on the amount of chemicals used in aquaculture within their borders; further, the information from temperate regions may not be applicable in lower latitudes. 7. Because some chemicals are essential for aquaculture activities, regulatory mechanisms must be put in place and monitoring must be undertaken. Governments, the scientific community and pharmaceutical companies all have a role to play in these efforts. III. Storage of carbon dioxide in the deep sea: The equilibrium between the atmosphere and the oceans may be sensitive to CO-2 emissions from anthropogenic sources. Can fossil fuel CO-2 be injected into deep oceans as a means of counteracting the effects of global warming? To address this possibility, the following factors must be considered. 1. The feasibility of capturing a large proportion of future carbon dioxide emissions from fossil-fuelled electrical generation and the disposal of such in the deep ocean. 2. The scientific and technical limitations. 3. The legal impediments. 4. The social and political concerns. 5. The total benefits vs the total costs (economic and environmental). IV. Review of the state of the marine environment (Working Group 26): Periodical assessments of the state of coastal and marine environments are being made. Emphasis is on the effects of, and threats by, humans to coastal and marine waters: 1. An initial activity is a report on Land-based Sources and Activities Affecting the Quality and Uses of the Marine, Coastal and Associated Freshwater Environment, to be ready in 1999. This report will contribute to the implementation of the Global Programme of Action for the Protection of the Marine Environment from Land-based Activities, for which the United Nations Environment Programme is the Secretariat. 2. GESAMP will prepare State of the Marine Environment reports every decade. 3. A comprehensive, integrated global international waters assessment (GIWA), encompassing the problems of freshwater basins, their associated coastal systems, and the global oceans, is being prepared. Collaborative possibilities between the GESAMP and GIWA assessments are being explored and a joint GESAMP/GIWA task force is being developed. V. Significant matters regarding degradation of the marine environment: 1. Technological developments now allow for much deeper drilling for oil and gas in oceans than was the case in the past. As a result, contamination and pollution from such activities can affect large offshore areas and their ecosystems. 2. Changes to the London Convention and the management of wastes. The ban on dumping of many wastes at sea from ships and barges may have in unforeseen repercussions. An example is increases in wastes through pipelines and rivers, thereby adversely affecting coastal areas. There may also be more land-based pollution. 3. Serious fisheries issues include overfishing and biomass removal, the physical impacts of fishing, by-catches of other species, new fisheries and their impact on ecosystem integrity. There clearly is a need to improve the science for monitoring of fisheries. 4. Contaminated marine sediments. Remedial options include capping of contaminated sediments with a layer of clean material, and removal and isolation elsewhere. Guidance is needed on appropriateness of the remediation, and on evaluation criteria such as effectiveness and overall costs/benefits (including the best net benefit for environmental protection). 5. A critical appraisal of the Large Marine Ecosystem (LME) concept is needed, including a review of the scientific foundation of LME's and their use as a management tool.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,1020-4873,,,,,,,,,,,"Nairobi, Kenya",,,,1997-01-01,BCI:BCI199799819845,,

Following this strategy, most attention has been paid to electrification of road transportation, i.e., electric vehicles. In addition, substantial potentials could be exploited in the electrification of offshore oil and gas platforms, as an alternative to on-site gas turbines. In our research, we focus on electrification of the offshore oil and gas installations in the Norwegian continental shelf. We apply a net transfer capacity (NTC) based power market model to analyse the economic consequence of the Norwegian offshore platforms electrification on six Northern European countries. The power market model comprises Norway, Denmark, Sweden, Finland, Germany, and the Netherlands. The objective of the optimisation model is to minimize the operating cost of the power system over the lifetime of the oil and gas offshore platform considered for electrification. The operating cost comprises the sum of fuel cost, start-up cost, and carbon emission cost for all generators. We analysed three scenarios for electrification and carbon prices, and we assumed a development path of wind and solar power that is in line with EU climate policy up to 2050. Firstly, we investigate the power system performance without considering environmental taxes. Secondly, we incorporate the carbon emission cost into the optimisation model to analyse how this affects the production mix in simulated countries.

We estimated the biomass-to-depth relationships from each data set by using Akaike Information Criterion and regarded the non-overlap of the 95% confidence intervals as indicating significant difference. The biomass was different from a 10 m depth below, and 3 times higher in the west coast at around 20 m compared with the maximum depth of the wind farm area. A local event of catastrophic sedimentation ranging from 1 to 2 m was observed in the wind farm during winter surveys. This could be a probable source of the lower biomass, but information studies.

Korean government also have started a 10-year R&D project on CO₂ storage in sea-bed geological structure including gas field and deep saline aquifer since 2005. Various relevant researches are carried out to cover the initial survey of suitable geological structure storage site, monitoring of the stored CO₂behavior, basic design of CO₂transport and storage process and the risk assessment and management related to CO₂leakage from engineered and geological processes. Leakage of CO₂to the marine environment can change the chemistry of seawater including the pH and carbonate composition and also influence adversely on the diverse living organisms in ecosystems. Recently, IMO (International Maritime Organization) have developed the risk assessment and management framework for the CO₂sequestration in sub-seabed geological structures (CS-SSGS) and considered the sequestration as a waste management option to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions. This framework for CS-SSGS aims to provide generic guidance to the Contracting Parties to the London Convention and Protocol, in order to characterize the risks to the marine environment from CS-SSGS on a site-specific basis and also to collect the necessary information to develop a management strategy to address uncertainties and any residual risks. The environmental risk assessment (ERA) plan for CO2 storage work should include site selection and characterization, exposure assessment with probable leak scenario, risk assessment from direct and in-direct impact to the living organisms and risk management strategy. Domestic trial of the CO₂capture and sequestration in to the marine geologic formation also should be accomplished through risk management with specified ERA approaches based on the IMO framework. The risk assessment procedure for CO₂marine storage should contain the following components; 1) prediction of leakage probabilities with the reliable leakage scenarios from both engineered and geological part, 2) understanding on physio-chemical fate of CO₂in marine environment especially for the candidate sites, 3) exposure assessment methods due to CO₂leakage to various receptors in marine environments, 4) database production on the toxic effect of CO₂to the ecologically and economically important species, and finally 5) development of surveillance procedures on the environmental changes with adequate monitoring techniques.",,,,"이산화탄소를 포함하는 온실가스의 증가로 인한 기후변화 영향을 저감하기 위해 최근 이산화탄소의 포집 및 저장(CCS)과 관련된 많은 연구들이 이루어지고 있다. 포집된 이산화탄소의 저장은 저장용량이 큰 육상/해상의 유․가스전, 대수층, 석탄층과 같은 지질구조를 이용한다. 이산화탄소의 포집 및 저장과정에서 예상되는 가장 중요한 문제는 이산화탄소의 환경 중 유출에 의해 발생할 수 있다. 사업과정 또는 이후의 이산화탄소의 유출은 잠재적으로 환경 변화 및 서식 생물에 심각한 위해를 미칠 수 있는 것으로 우려된다. 저장된 이산화탄소의 유출에 의한 환경 위해를 최소화하고 과학적으로 관리하기 위해서는 환경위해성평가 결과를 바탕으로 위해도 저감 및 관리가 이루어져야 할 것이다. 위해성평가는 기본적으로 효율적인 위해도 관리를 위한 정책 결정 도구로 활용되며, 예상되는 위해요인과 인간 및 생태계에 미치는 영향과의 관계에 대한 신뢰성 있는 자료를 바탕으로 노출평가와 영향평가를 수행한 후 위해도를 산정하는 과정이다. 최근 국제해사기구(IMO)는 해저 지중저장 사업을 위한 위해성평가 체계에 대한 일반 지침서를 제시하였고, 모든 해저 지중저장 사업의 수행 주체는 이 지침서를 기본으로 사업 수행 전 과정에 대한 위해성평가관리 체계를 마련하도록 요구하고 있다. 이 지침서는 이산화탄소의 해저 지중저장에 대한 환경위해성평가는 저장 지역에 대한 특성파악, 유출시나리오에 기반한 노출평가, 누출된 이산화탄소에 의한 생물에 대한 직접적인 영향 및 환경 변화에 의한 간접적인 영향이 고려된 영향평가 등을 포함한다. 국내에서 시도되는 이산화탄소의 포집 및 해저 지중저장사업 또한 IMO의 지침서를 기반으로 하되 사업과 환경 특성에 적합한 위해성평가관리 시스템을 구축할 필요가 있다. 국내의 이산화탄소 해양 지중저장사업에 대한 위해성평가관리 체계 마련을 위해서는, 후보지역의 환경 특성에 대한 연구를 바탕으로 해양환경에서 이산화탄소의 물리화학적 거동에 대한 이해, 육상 및 해양환경의 배경 조건 및 특성 파악, 포집 후 수송, 지중저장 지질구조에 적합한 개연성 있는 유출시나리오에 기반을 둔 노출평가와 국내 생물종을 이용한 생태영향평가 자료의 생산과 DB화, 그리고 유출 감시 및 환경 모니터링 기법 개발 등이 반드시 이루어져야 한다.",,,,,3,0,0,0,0,0,3,,,2288-0089,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2009-01-01,KJD:ART001391876,,

Near-term prospects favor CCS for electric power plants and certain industrial sources with storage in depleted oil and gas reservoirs as opposed to aquifers.

The mangrove peat formed a thin veneer, several tens of centimeters thick, and mangrove development was constrained by the formation of the reef flat. The initial mangrove development (389 cal yr BP) was much more recent than on other islands, possibly because the island is remote and weakly connected to other source islands. However, the mangrove forests in Tuvalu have geomorphic developmental rates and carbon burial rates similar to those in other settings. The mean carbon sequestration rate is six times that calculated previously from land use, land-use change, and forestry (LULUCF) data for Tuvalu. High vulnerability of the mangroves is suggested by the small sediment thickness and recent development of the mangrove forests, as well as by the past vertical accumulation rates potentially smaller than those of future sea-levels rise.

Coastal sand dunes bore the maximum impact. The cause of the erosion is unique. The orientation of the ship with respect to the coastline, its length, the distance of the ship from the coastline and, more importantly, the direction of the waves prevailing over the region suggest that the wreck acted like an offshore breakwater and triggered erosion along this coast. A tombolo was also formed on the lee side of the vessel, a process that eventually led to the formation of an accretion zone on the lee side. The zone of deposition is evidenced by the presence of a sand bar which gets partially exposed during low tide. As the littoral current along this coast is southward, the sand bar blocked the southward littoral drift. As a consequence, the sand depletion that followed subsequently induced erosion of the sea front. The extent of net erosion has been estimated at around 0.10934 sq. km (109,340 sq. m) during the past 12 years. A stretch of 1.5 km of the coast has receded by a maximum of 85 m. In economic terms, the loss of prime property is estimated at minimum 28 crore rupees. The direct impact of the wreck in eroding the coast is more explicit during the SW monsoon. The powerful intensity of winds and higher significant wave height (H-s = 2.59 m) during the SW monsoon deteriorate the shore front that is now devoid of sand dunes and, as a consequence, has gradually become fragile due to severe erosion.",,,,,,,,,6,0,0,0,3,0,6,,,0011-3891,,,,,,,,,,,"CSIR Natl Inst Oceanog, Panaji 403004, Goa, India",,,,2013-12-04,WOS:000326360300029,,

Upon reviewing the four scenarios, it is clear that the Rotterdam Nucleus (referred to as the 'Pilot Case') is the leading scenario and as a result it is explored in more detail. The potential Pilot Case is based on the development of Rotterdam (in the Netherlands) as a southern North Sea hub. Under this Rotterdam Nucleus scenario, captured CO2 will be transported through the Port of Rotterdam to depleted gas fields offshore the Netherlands. CO2 will also be transported through further links using CCS infrastructure to facilitate the processing of undeveloped gas fields offshore UK. The Pilot case contemplates further expansion opportunities, increasing the capture clusters through additional pipelines, expanding to further gas fields and using the port of Rotterdam for CO2 shipping-hence the analysis of the other scenarios may be invaluable in the future development of CO2 networks in the EU.

Each country has made the necessary investments to implement CCS and achieved results in developing and researching related technologies, but the current legal and regulatory systems are not sufficient for the deployment of CCS. Also, CCS can be related to a considerable number of environmental legal issues in that CCS technology is carried out through a series of processes, such as capture, transport, and sequestration, and that both types of onshore and offshore CCS are possible. For this reason, the relationship between CCS and existing environmental laws needs to be well established from a multiple point of view.On an international level, climate change-related laws and ocean-related laws need to be reviewed to see if they are consistent with CCS technology. As a result of analysis, it is evaluated that CCS technology is compatible with international treaties and norms. CCS is not in conflict with the UNFCCC and Kyoto Protocol but rather be a useful means of increasing the effectiveness of these treaties. CCS is also assessed as not contradictory to international laws regarding marine environmental protection, and CCS technology is expressly permitted by the London Protocol amendments. However, it is necessary to strictly enforce the contents and procedures associated with CCS deployment in accordance with the precautionary approach.CCS in incorporated in the CDM under the Kyoto Protocol, which expects that CCS projects are more likely to be applied to developing countries. In addition, the CDM's acceptance of CCS is expected to enhance the CDM's positive functions. However, problems such as excessive issuance of CERs, insufficient baseline and monitoring methodologies, and uncertainty of liability systems, are also exposed.

We surveyed Posidonia sinuosa meadows growing in different water depths to assess the variability in the sources, stocks and accumulation rates of Corg. We show that over the last 500 years, P. sinuosa meadows closer to the upper limit of distribution (at 2-4 m depth) accumulated 3- to 4-fold higher C-org stocks (averaging 6.3 kg C-org m(-2) at 3- to 4-fold higher rates (12.8 gC(org) m(-2) yr(-1) ) compared to meadows closer to the deep limits of distribution (at 6-8 m depth; 1.8 kg C-org m(-2) and 3.6 g C-org m(-2) yr(-1) . In shallower meadows, C-org stocks were mostly derived from seagrass detritus (88% in average) compared to meadows closer to the deep limit of distribution (45% on average). In addition, soil accumulation rates and fine-grained sediment content (< 0.125 mm) in shallower meadows (2.0 mm yr(-1) and 9 %, respectively) were approximately 2-fold higher than in deeper meadows (1.2 mm yr(-1) and 5 %, respectively). The C-org stocks and accumulation rates accumulated over the last 500 years in bare sediments (0.6 kg C-org m(-2) and 1.2 g C-org m(-2) yr(-1)were 3- to 11-fold lower than in P. sinuosa meadows, while fine-grained sediment content (1 %) and seagrass detritus contribution to the Corg pool (20 %) were 8- and 3-fold lower than in Posidonia meadows, respectively. The patterns found support the hypothesis that Corg storage in seagrass soils is influenced by interactions of biological (e.g., meadow productivity, cover and density), chemical (e.g., recalcitrance of Corg stocks) and physical (e.g., hydrodynamic energy and soil accumulation rates) factors within the meadow.

Moreover, as industrial use of the Arctic increases with the expansion of the open-water summer season, there is an urgent need to monitor the effects of noise from oil and gas exploration and commercial shipping on marine mammals. During September 2013, we deployed a single Slocum glider equipped with a digital acoustic monitoring (DMON) instrument to record and process in situ low-frequency (<5 kHz) audio to characterize marine mammal occurrence and habitat as well as ambient noise in the Chukchi Sea off the northwest coast of Alaska, USA. The DMON was programmed with the low-frequency detection and classification system (LFDCS) to autonomously detect and classify sounds of a variety of Arctic and sub-Arctic marine mammal species. The DMON/LFDCS reported regularly in near real time via Iridium satellite detailed detection data, summary classification information, and spectra of background noise. The spatial distributions of bowhead whale, bearded seal, and walrus call rates were correlated with surface salinity measured by the glider. Bowhead whale and walrus call rates were strongly associated with a warm and salty water mass of Bering Sea origin. With a passive acoustic capability that allows both archival recording and near real-time reporting, we envision ocean gliders will become a standard tool for marine mammal and ocean noise research and monitoring in the Arctic.",,,,,,,,,25,1,0,0,14,0,28,,,0025-3324,1948-1209,,,,,,,,,,"Woods Hole Oceanog Inst, Dept Biol, Woods Hole, MA 02543 USAUniv Washington, Appl Phys Lab, Seattle, WA 98195 USAUniv Alaska Fairbanks, Sch Fisheries & Ocean Sci, Fairbanks, AK USAHorizon Marine, Marion, MA USA",Horizon Marine,,,2014-12-17,WOS:000345057300006,,

However, site selection has been identified as the greatest difficulty; thus, the objective of this study was to develop a habitat suitability model that can increase restoration success. Two types of models were developed: a general restoration and a species restoration model (for large species - Enhalus acoroides, medium-sized species - Thalassia hemprichii or Cymodocea rotundata, small species - Halophila ovalis, and mixed species) using species distribution modeling based on physical and chemical variables. Data collection for model fitting was carried out throughout the year at Haad Chao Mai National Park, and the models were used to predict habitat suitability for restoration at three new sites. The results of the general restoration model suggest that all three sites are suitable for restoration, as the models predicted a mediocre (26-50%) to good (51-75%) probability of seagrasses occurrence. The species restoration model indicates that large species have an excellent (>75%) probability of occurrence at two out of the three sites, while medium-sized, small-sized and mixed species have a low (2-25%) to mediocre (26-50%) probability of occurrence, suggesting low to medium restoration potential.

It involves capturing carbon dioxide from power plants, transporting it and storing it in secure places including former oil and gas fields and marine aquifers. However, the use of coal does not only contribute to the global climate change, it also has other important environmental impacts, for example: acidification, eutrophication and depletion of non-renewable resources. In order to assess whether or to what extent the introduction of CCS to coal-fired power plants will contribute to reducing these and other environmental impacts, life cycle assessment (LCA) which considers a full supply chain from resource extraction to ultimate waste management should be conducted. This paper is part of the background research for the development of a full LCA study of coal-fired power plants with carbon capture and storage. Through a literature review of a wide range of international studies, particular attention is given to understanding the scopes of former LCA studies and their environmental assessments. The results of the review show that, although previous LCA studies have been informative to some extent, no complete LCA has been performed yet on coal combustion power plants with CCS, with important gaps identified in terms of the consideration of parts of the supply chain, alternative technologies and potentially important impact categories.

However, retrieving sediment cores from a subglacial environment faces more difficulties than sediment coring in oceans and lakes, resulting in low yields from the most current subglacial sediment coring methods. The coring tools should pass through a hot water-drilled access borehole, then the water column, to reach the sediment layers. The access boreholes are size-limited by the hot water drilling tools and techniques. These holes are drilled through ice up to 3000-4000 m thick, with diameters ranging from 10-60 cm, and with a refreezing closure rate of up to 6 mm/h after being drilled. Several purpose-built streamline corers have been developed to pass through access boreholes and collect the sediment core. The main coring objectives are as follows: (i) To obtain undisturbed water-sediment cores, either singly or as multi-cores and (ii) to obtain long cores with minimal stratigraphic deformation. Subglacial sediment coring methods use similar tools to those used in lake and ocean coring. These methods include the following: Gravity coring, push coring, piston coring, hammer or percussion coring, vibrocoring, and composite methods. Several core length records have been attained by different coring methods, including a 290 cm percussion core from the sub-ice-shelf seafloor, a 400 cm piston core from the sub-ice-stream, and a 170 cm gravity core from a subglacial lake. There are also several undisturbed water-sediment cores that have been obtained by gravity corers or hammer corers. Most current coring tools are deployed by winch and cable facilities on the ice surface. There are three main limitations for obtaining long sediment cores which determines coring tool development, as follows: Hot-water borehole radial size restriction, the sedimentary structure, and the coring techniques. In this paper, we provide a general view on current developments in coring tools, including the working principles, corer characteristics, operational methods, coring site locations, field conditions, coring results, and possible technical improvements.

Responsibility for management and conservation of wildlife in the Arctic falls heavily on the residents of the Arctic, but also on the global community that shares in the use of arctic resources. A sense of global stewardship toward the Arctic is critical for the future of arctic wildlife and its peoples. This chapter, drawing on Chapters 7 to 9, emphasizes that throughout most of the Arctic, natural ecosystems are still functionally intact and that threats to wildlife typical for elsewhere in the world - extensive habitat loss through agriculture, industry, and urbanization - are absent or localized. There is increasing evidence that contaminants from the industrialized world to the south are entering arctic food chains, threatening the health and reproduction of some marine mammals and birds and the humans who include them in their diets. Protection of critical wildlife habitats in the Arctic is becoming recognized by those living inside as well as outside the Arctic as essential for both the conservation of arctic wildlife and its sustainable harvest by residents of the Arctic. Management of wildlife and its conservation, as practiced in most of the Arctic, is conceptually different to that at lower latitudes where management efforts often focus on manipulation of habitats to benefit wildlife. The history of over-exploitation of marine mammals and birds for oil and skins to serve interests outside the Arctic is now being balanced by international efforts toward conservation of the flora and fauna of the Arctic, focusing on maintaining the Arctic's biodiversity and valuing its ecosystem components and relationships. Case studies from Russia and Canada focusing on harvest strategies and management of caribou (wild reindeer) highlight the complex nature of this species. One reports the development of a co-management system, involving shared responsibility between users of the wildlife and the government entities with legal authority over wildlife, giving local residents a greater role in wildlife management. Throughout much of the Arctic, harvesting of wildlifefor food and furs through hunting and trapping has been the most conspicuous influence that residents of the Arctic have had on arctic wildlife in recent decades. It was the overexploitation of wildlife during the period of arctic exploration and whaling, largely in the 18th and 19th centuries, that led to the extinction of the Steller sea cow in the Bering Sea and the great auk in the North Atlantic, and drastic stock reductionsand local extirpation of several other terrestrial and marine mammals and birds. In regions of the Eurasian Arctic, the adoption of reindeer herding by indigenous hunting cultures led to the extirpation or marked reduction of wild reindeer (caribou) and drastic reductions of wolves, lynx, wolverines, and other potential predators of reindeer. Heavy grazing pressure by semi-domestic reindeer along with encroachmentof timber harvest, agriculture, hydroelectric development, and oil and gas exploration have altered plant community structure in parts of the Fennoscandian and Russian Arctic. Large-scale extraction of nonrenewable resources accelerated in the Arctic during the latter half of the 20th century with impacts on some wildlife species and their habitats, especially in Alaska from oil production, in Canada from miningfor diamonds and other minerals, and in Russia primarily from extraction of nickel, apatite, phosphates, oil, and natural gas. Among the factors that influence arctic wildlife, harvest of wildlife through hunting and trapping is potentially the most manageable, at least at the local level. Indigenous peoples throughout much of the North are asserting their views and rights in management of wildlife, in part through gains inpolitical autonomy over their homelands. Arctic residents are now starting to influence when, where, and how industrial activity may take place in the Arctic. Part of this process has been the consolidation of the efforts of indigenous peoples across national boundaries to achieve a greater voice in management of wildlife and other resources through international groups such as the Inuit Circumpolar Conference andthe Indigenous Peoples Secretariat of the Arctic Council. The stage appears to be set for indigenous peoples of the Arctic to become major participants in the management and conservation of arctic wildlife. The legal institutions, however, encompassing treaty and land rights and other governmental agreements vary regionally and nationally throughout the Arctic, posing differing opportunities and constraints on howstructures for wildlife management and conservation can be developed. This chapter provides examples from throughout the Arctic which show that conservation of wildlife requires sound management and protection of wildlife habitats at the local, regional, and national levels if theproductivity of those wildlife populations upon which arctic peoples depend is to be sustained.Wildlife populations and their movements in both the marine and also stress the need for development of regional land and water use plans as a basis for protection of critical wildlife habitats in relation to existing and proposed human activities on the lands and waters of the Arctic. terrestrial environments transcend local, regional, and national boundaries, thus successful management and conservation of arctic wildlife requires international agreements and treaties. The chapter concludes that responsibility for maintaining the biodiversity that characterizes the Arctic, the quality of its natural environment,and the productivity of its wildlife populations must be exercised through global stewardship. Guidelines are provided for effective management and associated conservation of wildlife in a changing Arctic with emphasis on the complexity and limitations of managing wildlife in marine systems. The guidelines also stress the need for development of regional land and water use plans as a basis for protection of criticalwildlife habitats in relation to existing and proposed human activities on the lands and waters of the Arctic.",,,,,,,,,14,0,0,0,9,0,14,,,,,0-521-86509-3,,,,,,,,,"University of Alaska Fairbanks, USA",,,,2005-01-01,ZOOREC:ZOOR14208050617,,

They can often be time consuming as the result of the wreck being poorly defined, or buried in the sediment with little surface indication of their location.The majority of true wreck investigation, archaeological appraisal and recording is conducted and will likely continue to be conducted by marine divers. This is often essential for the precise recording of artefacts; however, there is often an initial need to locate the wreck site and/or its subsequent extent. Additionally, visibility and available bottom-time may severely hamper the diver in the detection of all seabed evidence.Within the paper, it is intended to look at the relative value of magnetometers, sidescan sonar, sub-bottom profilers and swathe bathymetric systems in offering assistance to the diver within their initial searches and within an appraisal of the extent of the heritage site. This will be achieved by examining activities over two wreck sites; those of the Earl of Abergavenny (1805), where magnetometer and sonar surveys were compared against the known location of artefacts; and secondly, an investigation of an area of seabed, believed to be the site of the Bellona (1779), using magnetometer, sidescan sonar and sub-bottom profiler.Conclusions are drawn on the effectiveness of the sensors used, the benefits of an integrated approach and reviews the potential offered by alternatives, such as the emerging technologies offered by swathe bathymetry systems.",,,,,"2nd International Conference on Maritime Heritage/4th International Conference on Maritime Engineering, Ports and Waterways2nd International Conference on Maritime Heritage/4th International Conference on Maritime Engineering, Ports and Waterways","APR 18-20, 2005APR 18-20, 2005",Wessex Inst TechnolWessex Inst Technol,"Barcelona, SPAINBarcelona, SPAIN",4,0,0,0,2,0,6,,,,,1-84564-010-1,,,,,,,,,"Univ Plymouth, Sch Earth Ocean & Environm Sci, Plymouth PL4 8AA, Devon, England",,,,2005-01-01,WOS:000230351500018,,

Fourteen hydrographic parameters, including temperature, salinity, dissolved oxygen, pH, biochemical oxygen demand, total suspended solids, water transparency and levels of ammonia, nitrite, nitrate, phosphate, silicate, chlorophyll a and phaeo-pigment content, were measured. This hydrographic monitoring revealed that water quality at the study site was typical of Hong Kong's northeastern inshore waters. Stratification of the water column, in relation to temperature, dissolved oxygen, salinity and photosynthetic pigment levels, occurred regularly in the summer at Hoi Ha Wan. Hydrographic parameters which showed abnormal levels during an hypoxic event in July 1994, were identified and included an increase in chlorophyll a and phaeo-pigment and a decrease in salinity and phosphate levels. Dissolved oxygen levels in the bottom waters were very low (< 2 mgcntdotL-1). A range of reasons for such an hypoxic event is put forward.

An offshore carbonate reservoir has been identified in which all aspects of CCS are investigated in detail. There, the CO2 is planned to be re-injected into a saline aquifer. However, formation damage in underground formations linked with permeability reduction can significantly impact oil and gas production and could render CCS infeasible. Thus, in order to manage the injection of CO2 from the subsurface side a study was conducted investigating geomechanical aspects, rock fluid interactions as well as production aspects from the gas field. Only very few studies exist that investigate scaling and dissolution effects at elevated pressures and temperatures. Here, results from 3 high pressure high temperature scaling and dissolution core floods for the scheduled to be developed carbonate field are presented in detail. Core floods were performed under temperatures ranging between 121 degrees C to 136 degrees C and CaCO3 scaling tendencies between 0.24 and 1.47. The scaling tendency of each brine was adjusted to represent, baseline, assumed worst case scaling as well as worst case dissolution scenarios identified based on fluid and gas samples and prior geochemical modelling. Bicarbonate, Calcium and pH were analysed from samples taken during the core flood. SEM-EDX analysis was done on core flood effluent particles. A calcite dissolution rate of 0.008 mol/m(2)/sec was calculated for the core flood with the scaling tendency of 0.24. The specific surface area of the calcite was estimated at 0.17 cm(2)/mol.

Various factors cause the free span of submarine pipelines, including wave flow scouring, fluctuations in seabed topography, residual stress or thermal stress of pipelines, and human activities. The scour of the wave current is the main factor affecting free span; the research on sediment starting and equilibrium depth during scour is reviewed in-depth. For the span treatment of submarine pipelines, the main measures available at present include the re-digging trench burying, structural support, covering bionic water plants, and choke plate self-burying. For each, the principle, advantages, disadvantages, and research are discussed.

These diverse physical features of fjords are key in controlling the sources, transport, and burial of organic matter in the modern era and over the Holocene. High sediment accumulation rates in fjord sediments allow for high-resolution records of past climate and environmental change where multiple proxies can be applied to fjord sediments that focus on either marine or terrestrial-derived components.Humans through land-use change and climatic stressors are having an impact on the larger carbon stores in fjords. Sediment delivery whether from accelerating erosion (e.g. mining, deforestation, road building, agriculture) or from sequestration of fluvial sediment behind dams has been seriously altered in the Anthropocene. Climate change affecting rainfall and river discharge into fjords will impact the thickness and extent of the low-salinity layer in the upper reaches of the fjord, slowing the rate of the overturning circulation and deep-water renewal - thereby impacting bottom water oxygen concentrations.",,,,,,,,,94,1,0,0,44,2,98,,,0012-8252,1872-6828,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Florida, Dept Geol Sci, Gainesville, FL 32611 USAUniv Libre Bruxelles, Dept Geosci Environm & Soc, BGeoSys, Brussels, BelgiumUniv St Andrews, Sch Geog & Sustainable Dev, St Andrews KY16 9AL, Fife, ScotlandUniv Ghent, Renard Ctr Marine Geol, Krijgslaan 281 S8, B-9000 Ghent, BelgiumMIT, Dept Earth Atmospher & Planetary Sci, 77 Massachusetts Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139 USAUniv Leeds, Sch Earth & Environm, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, EnglandPolish Acad Sci, Inst Oceanol, Ul Powstancow Warszawy 55, Sopot, PolandUniv Otago, Dept Geol, POB 56, Dunedin 9054, New ZealandUniv Otago, Dept Marine Sci, Dunedin, New ZealandUniv Cape Town, Marine Res Inst, Dept Biol Sci, Cape Town, South AfricaGlobal Aquat Res LLC, Sodus, NY 14551 USAUniv Colorado, INSTAAR, CSDMS Integrat Facil, Boulder, CO 80309 USAScottish Marine Inst, Scottish Assoc Marine Sci, Oban PA37 1QA, Argyll, Scotland",Global Aquat Res LLC,,,2020-04-01,WOS:000529058200013,,

The subsea pipeline is subject to considerable loads ranging from hydrodynamics forces from the sea current to seabed contact forces. Those contact forces are very important in risers design life, since high and concentrated bending moment stresses are observed in the region where the pipeline starts to be supported by the seafloor. The proper representation of the soil behavior in contact with the structure comprises a very important topic of study in subsea pipelines. In this context, a consistent pipeline-seabed interaction model based on Kerr-type foundation is presented. A finite element formulation for the soil, where the stiffness matrix is derived from a variational formulation of a three parameter elastic foundation model, is proposed. The pipeline is modeled as a planar beam undergoing large displacements using a co-rotational approach. The unilateral contact between soil and pipeline is dealt with a step-loading procedure. The proposed model is able to solve problems where the pipeline is initially placed above the foundation surface and subsequent contact with the seafloor is induced by large displacement of the structure.

To better understand this process, a nonlinear 3D numerical model based on the open-source CFD platform OpenFOAM (R) was self-developed in this study. The Navier-Stokes equations were used to compute the two-phase incompressible flow, combining with the finite volume method (FVM) to discretize calculation domain, a modified VOF method to track the free surface, and a k - epsilon model to closure the turbulence. The nearshore sediment transport process is reproduced in view of shear stress, suspended load, and bed load, in which the terms of shear stress and suspended load were updated by introducing volume fraction. The seabed morphology is updated based on Exner equation and implemented by dynamic mesh technique. The mass conservative sand slide algorithm was employed to avoid the incredible vary of the bed mesh. Importantly, a two-way coupling method connecting the hydrodynamic module with the beach morphodynamic module is implemented at each computation step to ensure the fluid-sediment interaction. The capabilities of this model were calibrated by laboratory data from some published references, and the advantages/disadvantages, as well as proper recommendations, were introduced.

Fewer than 5% of the gold coral colonies seen were in the process of subsuming their host, described here as the 'midas' phase. Bamboo coral (Acanella, Keratoisis) comprised 85% of the midas colonies, with two-thirds found at the youngest site, where the mean height of bamboo coral was significantly greater than at other sites.

Then on May 28, 2008, we received a petition from the Center for Biological Diversity to list the bearded seal as a threatened or endangered species under the ESA, primarily due to concern about threats to this species' habitat from climate warming and loss of sea ice. To assist with determining whether listing of the bearded seal under the ESA is warranted, a Biological Review Team (BRT) was convened by the NMFS to assess the best available information concerning the status of ringed seals (Erignathus barbatus) and past, present, and future threats to the species. The BRT's review included delineating population structure within the species and assessing the risk of extinction at present and in the foreseeable future. The review is intended to inform NMFS's decision about whether to list the species as endangered or threatened. The ESA defines an endangered species as any species which is in danger of extinction throughout all or a significant portion of its range. A threatened species is defined as any species which is likely to become an endangered species within the foreseeable future throughout all or a significant portion of its range. The foreseeable future was not considered to be fixed but, rather, threat specific. Ice habitats are affected by climate which is forecast to continue changing directionally at least until the end of the century in response to greenhouse gas forcing. Variability in the magnitude[long dash]but not the directionality[long dash]of projected climate change increases over time and is reflected in inter-model variability and in levels of certainty assigned to the BRT's assessments of threats and demographic risks. Species Background: The bearded seal is a member of the true seals (Phocidae), a group of mammals highly adapted for a primarily aquatic existence. The species diverged about 11 million years ago from its nearest common ancestor with other extant seal species, prior to the emergence of the white fetal or natal coat that is typical of most northern phocid species and thought to be a specific adaptation to reproducing on sea ice. Nevertheless, they inhabit the seasonally ice-covered seas of the Northern Hemisphere where they whelp and rear their pups, and molt their coats on the ice in the spring and early summer. After reaching sexual maturity[long dash] typically at 5-6 years[long dash]most female bearded seals produce a single pup each year. Most pups are born in April, but March and May births are common in some areas. The pups are able to enter the water within hours of birth. They begin to forage while still under maternal care during a nursing period of about 24 days. Males typically attain sexual maturity at 6-7 years. A lifespan of about 20-25 years is normal, with a maximum of about 30 years. Like all phocids, bearded seals shed and regenerate their hair and epidermis annually but the process is more prolonged and diffuse than in other species. The timing and duration of molting seems to vary substantially among regions and individuals, but molting generally occurs in April to June or July. Bearded seals feed primarily on benthic organisms, including epifaunal and infaunal invertebrates, and demersal fishes and so are closely linked to areas where the seafloor is shallow. However, they are also able to switch their diet to include schooling pelagic fishes, when advantageous. Species Delineation: Two subspecies of bearded seals are widely recognized: E. b. barbatus often described as inhabiting the Atlantic sector, and E. b. nauticus inhabiting the Pacific sector. The geographic distributions of these subspecies are not separated by conspicuous gaps, and there are regions of intergrading generally described as somewhere along the northern Russian and central Canadian coasts. The BRT defined longitude 112[degree] W in the Canadian Arctic Archipelago as the North American delineation between the two subspecies and 145[degree] E as the Eurasian delineation between the two subspecies. Based on evidence for discreteness and ecological uniqueness of bearded seals in the Sea of Okhotsk, the E. b. nauticus subspecies was further divided into an Okhotsk DPS and a Beringia DPS, so named because the continental shelf waters of the Bering, Chukchi, Beaufort, and East Siberian Seas that are the bearded seals range in this region overlie much of the land bridge that was exposed during the last glaciation and that has been referred to as Beringia. Extinction Risk Assessment: The BRT evaluated 19 specific threats to bearded seals grouped by the ESA Section 4(a)(1) factors: [center dot] the present or threatened destruction, modification, or curtailment of its habitat or range,[center dot] overutilization for commercial, recreational, scientific, or educational purposes,[center dot] disease or predation,[center dot] the inadequacy of existing regulatory mechanisms, or [center dot] other natural or manmade factors affecting its continued existence. Present or threatened destruction, modification, or curtailment of the species' habitat or range: The BRT assessed the observed and projected changes with significant potential to impact the bearded seal's range and habitat, including both the physical and biological components of habitat, such as changes in sea ice, ocean temperature, ocean pH (acidity), and associated changes in bearded seal prey species. The main concern about the conservation status of bearded seals stems from the likelihood that their sea-ice habitat has been modified by the warming climate and, more so, that the scientific consensus projections are for continued and perhaps accelerated warming in the foreseeable future. A second major concern, related by the common driver of carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions, is the modification of habitat by ocean acidification, which may alter prey populations and other important aspects of the marine ecosystem. A reliable assessment of the future conservation status of each bearded seal species segment requires a focus on projections of specific regional conditions, especially sea ice. Global climate models selected for their consistency with the observed records of regional sea ice were used to project mean, minimum and maximum ice extent in each of the months of March, April, May, June, and July, for each of the decadal periods centered on the years 2030, 2050, and 2090. In a few regions, where the global climate models were poor at hindcasting the observed sea ice, less direct means of predicting ice cover[long dash]such as comparison of air temperature predictions with past climatology[long dash]were necessary. For bearded seals, the presence of sea ice is considered a requirement for whelping and nursing young. Similarly, the molt is believed to be promoted by elevated skin temperatures that, in polar regions, can only be achieved when seals haul out of the water. Thus, if suitable ice cover is absent from shallow feeding areas during times of peak whelping and nursing (April/May), or molting (May/June and sometimes through August), bearded seals would be forced to seek either sea-ice habitat over deeper waters (perhaps with poor access to food) or coastal regions in the vicinity of haul-out sites on shore (perhaps with increased risks of disturbance, predation, and competition). Both scenarios would require bearded seals to adapt to novel (i.e., suboptimal) conditions, and to exploit habitats to which they may not be well adapted, likely compromising their reproduction and survival rates. Research suggests that, during the time of whelping and nursing, bearded seals prefer areas where the percent concentration of sea ice is >25%. Lacking a more direct measure of the relationship between bearded seal vital rates and ice coverage, the BRT assumed that this preference relationship reflects the species requirements for sea-ice coverage and defined areas within the current core distribution of bearded seals where the ice projections were below 25% concentration, as inadequate for whelping and nursing. The BRT also assumed that ice coverage <15% would be insufficient for molting. In the Chukchi, Beaufort, East Siberian, Kara, Laptev, and Greenland Seas, as well as Baffin Bay and the Canadian Arctic Archipelago, little or no decline in ice extent is expected for the months of March [long dash] May during the remainder of the century; in most of these areas there will be a moderate decline of June ice cover and a substantial decline of July ice cover. More southerly waters, such as the Sea of Okhotsk, Bering Sea, Hudson Bay, and Barents Sea, are expected to have substantial reductions in average and minimum March - May ice extents by the middle or end of this century; June and July ice cover in these areas has historically been sparse and variable in June [long dash] July and will be even more so in the future. Although the distribution of bearded seal breeding and molting areas are not well documented, these more southerly parts of their range are likely to very important. Ocean acidification, a result of increased carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, may impact bearded seal survival and recruitment through disruption of trophic regimes that are dependent on calcifying organisms. The nature and timing of such impacts are extremely uncertain. Changes in bearded seal prey, anticipated in response to ocean warming and loss of sea ice, have the potential for negative impacts, but the possibilities are complex. Ecosystem responses may have very long lags as they propagate through trophic webs. Because of bearded seals' apparent dietary flexibility, this threat may be of less immediate concern than the threats from sea-ice degradation. Overutilization for commercial, subsistence, recreational, scientific, or educational purposes: Recreational, scientific, and educational utilization of bearded seals is currently at low levels and is not projected to increase to significant threat levels in the foreseeable future for any of the DPSs. Bearded seals' solitary nature has made them less suitable for commercial exploitation than many other seal species. Still, they may have been depleted by commercial harvests in some areas of the Sea of Okhotsk and the Bering, Barents, and White Seas during the mid-20th century. There is currently no significant commercial harvest of bearded seals and significant harvests seem unlikely in the foreseeable future. Bearded seals have been a very important species for subsistence of indigenous people in the Arctic for thousands of years. The current subsistence harvest is substantial in some areas but there is little or no evidence that subsistence harvests have or are likely to pose serious risk to the species. Diseases, parasites, and predation: A variety of diseases and parasites have been documented to occur in bearded seals. The seals have likely co-evolved with many of these and the observed prevalence is typical and similar to other species of seals. Abiotic and biotic changes to bearded seal habitat potentially could lead to exposure to new pathogens or new levels of virulence, but the BRT considered the potential threats to bearded seals as low. Polar bears are the primary predators of bearded seals, but other predators include brown bears, killer whales, sharks, and walruses. Predation under the future scenario of reduced sea ice is difficult to assess; polar bear predation may decrease, but predation by killer whales, sharks and walrus may increase. Inadequacy of existing regulatory mechanisms: Harvests and incidental takes by fisheries and commercial activities are reasonably well regulated throughout the range of bearded seals. Currently, however, there are no effective mechanisms to regulate the global greenhouse gas emissions that are driving[long dash]via climate warming[long dash]destruction of ringed seal habitat. The BRT implicitly considered impacts of inadequate regulation of greenhouse gas emissions by way of the emissions scenarios used in forecast models; the scenarios were all non mitigated, meaning that they assumed no globally- significant framework for regulating or reducing emissions would be implemented. Other natural or human factors affecting the species' continued existence: Contaminants, oil and gas industry activities, fisheries, and shipping all have potential to impact bearded seal populations. Compared to the far-reaching changes expected in sea ice and ocean conditions, the future changes and impacts from these other factors were judged by the BRT as likely to be more localized and less significant. Status of the bearded seal species segments: The BRT reviewed published data and consulted with other experts to evaluate the specific threats to population persistence for the E. b. barbatus subspecies and the Beringia and Okhotsk DPSs of bearded seals. Threats were scored quantitatively and the level of certainty in scores was recorded. Risks posed by the inadequacy of existing regulatory mechanisms were not included as part of this scoring. The BRT also assessed the risks to population persistence posed by those threats in demographic terms (abundance, productivity, spatial structure, and diversity). E. b. barbatus: The present population size is very uncertain, but was estimated to be about 188,000 individuals. Sea ice of sufficient concentration is expected to persist in the Canadian Arctic Archipelago and Baffin Bay through the end of the century. Throughout the rest of E. b. barbatus's range, however, the reduction in sea ice is expected to be more dramatic, particularly in the Barents Sea which will become ice free in June within the next few decades. The impacts of the loss of sea ice in the Barents Sea, and the reduction of sea ice in the Kara Sea, could theoretically be offset by the creation of more suitable sea ice habitat in the Laptev Sea which currently has high concentrations of ice and low numbers of bearded seals, though we are not aware of past examples in which similar mitigative shifts in habitat have occurred during rapid climatic changes. The BRT judged the decoupling, or spatial separation of sea ice from benthic feeding habitat to be a moderate to high threat to the subspecies E. b. barbatus; this, and a decrease in sea-ice habitat suitable for molting were judged to be nearly the same strength and the most significant threats to the subspecies. Both threats stem from the anticipated reduction in sea ice area and seasonal persistence, and these combined with other sea-ice, climate, and ocean acidification threats were reflected in a moderate to high score overall for threats associated with habitat modification or loss. Threats within the other ESA Section 4(a)(1) factors were judged to be low or moderate. The present risks that this subspecies is in danger of extinction due to demographic problems of abundance, productivity, spatial structure, and diversity were all judged to be low or very low in severity, reflecting the evidence that the population is large and apparently occupying its historic range. Within the foreseeable future, the risks that demographic problems might place the population in danger of extinction were consistently judged to be higher than at present (medium in severity), reflecting the anticipated decline in sea ice habitat over the remainder of the 21st century and consequent impacts on spatial structure (loss of habitat patches) and productivity (changes in vital rates of reproduction and survival). Beringia DPS: The present population size is very uncertain, but was estimated to be about 155,000 individuals. In the East Siberian, Chukchi and Beaufort Seas the average ice extents during the whelping, nursing, mating and part of the molting period are all predicted to be very close to historical averages out to 2095 with typically 25% or greater ice concentration over the entire shelf zones. End of century projections for the Bering Sea in April-May suggest that there will be sufficient ice only in small zones of the Gulf of Anadyr and in the area between St. Lawrence Island and Bering Strait. In June, suitable ice is predicted to disappear as early as mid-century. To adapt to this regime, bearded seals would likely have to shift their nursing, rearing and molting areas to the ice covered seas north of the Bering Strait. The most significant threats to the persistence of bearded seals in the Beringia DPS were judged to be the same ones as for the E. b. barbatus subspecies, plus the threat of a decrease in prey density or availability due to changes in ocean temperature and ice cover. These and other threats related to loss of sea ice habitat and climate-related changes in ocean conditions were scored in the moderate to high range, leading to an overall score of high for threats of habitat modification or loss. Threats within the other ESA Section 4(a)(1) factors were judged to be low or moderate. The threat-specific and overall habitat factor scores were generally higher for the Beringia DPS than for E. b. barbatus, likely a measure of greater concern about declines in ice extent that would separate sea ice suitable for pup maturation and molting from benthic feeding areas. The risk of this is likely greater in the range of the Beringia DPS, where the spring and summer ice edge may retreat to deep water of the Arctic Ocean basin, than in much of the range of E. b. barbatus, where summer ice refugia are anticipated to occur in the Canadian Arctic Archipelago and northern Greenland. The present risks that the Beringia DPS is in danger of extinction due to demographic problems of abundance, productivity, spatial structure, and diversity were all judged to be low or very low in severity, again on the basis of a large population occupying its historic range. Within the foreseeable future, the risks that demographic problems might place the population in danger of extinction were consistently judged to be higher than at present (medium to high in severity), and higher than the corresponding risks to E. b. barbatus. Okhotsk DPS: The present population size is very uncertain, but was estimated to be about 95,000 individuals. By the end of this century, the Sea of Okhotsk is predicted to frequently be ice free, or nearly so, during April [long dash] June, the crucial months for those important life history events. The ice-covered area is much smaller in the Sea of Okhotsk than the Bering Sea and, unlike in the Bering Sea, there is no marine connection to the Arctic Ocean. Over the long-term, bearded seals in the Sea of Okhotsk do not have the prospect of following a shift in the average position of the ice front northward as seals in the Bering Sea would. The greatest threats to the persistence of bearded seals in the Okhotsk DPS were judged to be decreases in sea ice habitat suitable for whelping, nursing, pup maturation, and molting. These threats, which were scored as high, are more severe in the range of the Okhotsk DPS than in the ranges of the Beringia DPS and E. b. barbatus. The overall score for habitat-related threats also was greatest for the Okhotsk DPS (high, tending toward very high). Although the scores for the other ESA Section 4(a)(1) factors were in the low to moderate range, they tended to be higher than those for E. b. barbatus and the Beringia DPS. The present risks that the Okhotsk DPS is in danger of extinction due to demographic problems of abundance, productivity, spatial structure, and diversity were all judged to be low in severity but the numerical scores were somewhat higher than for the other species segments. This may be a result not only of stronger threats identified above, but also of the somewhat lower confidence (certainty scores) ascribed to the threats scores for the Okhotsk DPS. Within the foreseeable future, the risks that demographic problems might place the Okhotsk DPS in danger of extinction were consistently judged to be higher than at present (high for abundance, productivity, and spatial structure; medium for severity), and the highest of the three species segments.",,,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Alaska Fisheries Sci Ctr, 7600 Sand Point Way NE, Seattle, WA 98115, USA",,,,2011-05-25,ZOOREC:ZOOR14706045328,,

Generated and/or trapped oil and gas can leak to near-surface sediments and ocean in detectable concentrations. The seepage surface expression is controlled by hydrocarbon generation, regional pressure regimes, and migration pathways. The migrated hydrocarbon concentration and composition varies due to seepage rates and near-surface physical and biological processes that can alter the signal.

On uninhabited remote islands, such introductions are likely to come from shipwrecks. Here we use a comprehensive database of shipwrecks in Western Alaska to model the frequency of shipwrecks per Aleutian and Bering Sea island, taken as a proxy for the threat of rodent introductions, using physical variables, and the intensity of nearby fishing traffic and activity as predictors. Using data spanning from 1950 to 2013, we found that shipwrecks were particularly common in the 1980s to early 2000s, with a major peak in wrecks during the late 1980s. Amount of fishing activity within 5 km of an island was the strongest predictor of shipwrecks, followed by the strength of tidal currents and density of large-vessel traffic. Islands with the highest frequency of shipwrecks are all in the eastern Aleutians, including Unimak, Unalaska, and Akun Islands. By contrast, the largest seabird colonies are in the western Aleutian and Pribilof Islands, including Buldir, Kiska, and Saint George islands. Multiplying the frequency of a shipwreck by the number of seabirds breeding per island provides a measure of risk. The risk of rodent introductions from shipwrecks to seabirds was then greatest for Saint George (Bering Sea), Buldir (Western Aleutians) and Saint Matthew islands (Bering Sea). Keeping these high-risk islands rodent free would maintain their high a conservation value. Most islands with a high predicted frequency of shipwrecks already have established rodent populations and therefore few remaining seabirds. Of those islands with established rodent populations, Attu and Kiska Islands would make suitable targets for eradication, given their relatively low expected frequency of shipwrecks for their size. Further improvements in rat prevention on vessels and shipping safety would benefit the economy, human health and safety, and to the long-term conservation of island ecosystems.",,,,,,,,,2,0,0,0,1,0,2,,,1387-3547,1573-1464,,,,,,,,,,"Tern Again Consulting, 811 Ocean Dr Loop, Homer, AK 99603 USAAlaska Maritime NWR, 95 Sterling Hwy, Homer, AK 99603 USANOAA Fisheries AFSC, 17109 Pt Lena Loop Rd, Juneau, AK 99801 USANOAA Fisheries AFSC, 7600 Sand Point Way NE, Seattle, WA 98115 USAAleutian & Bering Sea Islands LCC, 1011 East Tudor Rd, Anchorage, AK 99503 USAWildlife Conservat Soc, Fairbanks, AK USAUS Geol Survey, Pacific Isl Ecosyst Res Ctr, POB 44,Hawaii Natl Pk, Honolulu, HI 96718 USA",Tern Again ConsultingAlaska Maritime NWRNOAA Fisheries AFSCNOAA Fisheries AFSCAleutian & Bering Sea Islands LCC,,,2018-08-22,WOS:000441112500026,,

Taunton Bay is centrally located within Maine's Island-Bay Coastal Complex, a physiographic region that encompasses 47% of the state's coastline. Riverine inputs of sediments and sediment-associated organic matter to this and most Maine estuaries are quite low. These estuary soils form by incremental additions of reworked glaciofluvial marine sediments and estuarine organic matter to the soil surface. The organics are protected from decomposition by anaerobic conditions. As sea level rises, the estuary area increases by inundating and submerging the soils at its edges. The average concentration of soil organic C in the top 1 m of these estuary soils is 2.4% and the average soil bulk density is 0.67 g cm(-3). The organic C content is 136 Mg C ha(-1), which is greater than the C content in the top 1 m of Maine's upland soils.

Pipeline behaviour in upheaval buckling depends on a number of factors including the shape of pipeline imperfection, installation stresses, loading types, seabed sediment behaviour and the flexural stiffness of the pipe. Current method of predicting upheaval buckling is based on simplified shapes of pipeline imperfection developed for idealized seabed conditions. To account for the effect of internal pressure, the pressure load is represented using an equivalent temperature. However, the applicability of these idealizations on the prediction of upheaval buckling has not been well-investigated. In this paper, the three-dimensional finite element modelling technique is used to investigate the applicability of idealized shapes and their effects on the upheaval buckling of pipeline for a seabed condition at offshore Newfoundland in Canada. The finite element model is then used to conduct a parametric study to investigate the effects of installation stress, loading types, seabed parameters and the flexural stiffness of the pipe. Finally, a design chart is developed to determine the optimum height of seabed features to manage pipeline stability against upheaval buckling under different temperature and pressure loadings.

Aside from predicting the likelihood of a leak event, the key issue is to understand the spread, persistence and impact of a hypothetical CCS derived leak and contrast this with, for example, trawling impacts and the global long-term consequences of climate change and the uptake of anthropogenically created atmospheric CO2 (ocean acidification), which CCS seeks to mitigate. Excess CO2 in the marine system is undoubtedly harmful to many organisms. In the vicinity of a leak event, it is likely that significant ecological alteration would occur.

There is no surface water in the immediate vicinity of the wreck. The chemical characteristics of three intertidal springs, as well as the Indian Ocean, were documented. Enough freshwater discharged from two of the three springs to cause a decrease of the salinity and pH, and an increase of the temperature, of the ocean water over a distance along the shore of 100 m. The chloride concentrations of the springs ranged between 3 and 6.5 g/L, and the shipwreck survivors might have resorted to drinking this brackish water.

We found that research focusing on offshore wind energy within the last couple of years has increased significantly as well, catching up with the vast amount of onshore studies. Some hypotheses have been verified by numerous publications and a consensus has been reached (e.g., correlation between bat activity and weather factors), while others are still being debated more (e.g., determination of migratory corridors) or remain unknown (e.g., effect on population level). Factors influencing potential effects were mainly related to species characteristics (morphology, phenology, abundance, behavior, and response to turbines) or site characteristics (landscape features, weather, and habitat quality).

Concurrent with the addition of nutrients via municipal, industrial, and agricultural sources, widespread consumer exploitation is changing consumer-mediated nutrient dynamics drastically. Thus, altered nutrient dynamics can occur through changes in the supply of multiple nutrients, as well as through changes in the sources of these nutrients. Seagrass ecosystems are heavily impacted by human activities, with highly altered nutrient dynamics from multiple causes. We simulate scenarios of altered nutrient supply and ratios, nitrogen:phosphorus (N:P), from two nutrient sources in seagrass ecosystems: anthropogenic fertilizer and fish excretion. In doing so we tested expectations rooted in ecological theory that suggest the importance of resource dynamics for predicting primary producer dynamics. Ecosystem functions were strongly altered by artificial fertilizer (e.g., seagrass growth increased by as much as 140%), whereas plant/algae community structure was most affected by fish-mediated nutrients or the interaction of both treatments (e.g., evenness increased by similar to 140% under conditions of low fish nutrients and high anthropogenic nutrients). Interactions between the nutrient sources were found for only two of six response variables, and the ratio of nutrient supply was the best predictor for only one response. These findings show that seagrass structure and function are well predicted by supply of a single nutrient (either N or P). Importantly, no single nutrient best explained the majority of responsesmeasures of community structure were best explained by the primary limiting nutrient to this system (P), whereas measures of growth and density of the dominant producer in the system were best explained by N. Thus, while our findings support aspects of theoretical expectations, the complexity of producer community responses belies broad generalities, underscoring the need to manage for multiple simultaneous nutrients in these imperiled coastal ecosystems.",,,,,,,,,10,0,0,0,9,0,11,,,0012-9658,1939-9170,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Michigan, Dept Ecol & Evolut Biol, 2220 Biol Sci,Bldg 1105 N Univ Ave, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USANorth Carolina State Univ, Dept Appl Ecol, 100 Eugene Brooks Ave,127 David Clark Labs, Raleigh, NC 27695 USASam Houston State Univ, Dept Biol Sci, 1900 Ave 1,Lee Drain Bldg,Suite 300, Huntsville, TX 77340 USAUniv Georgia, Odum Sch Ecol, 120 East Green St, Athens, GA 30602 USA",,,,2018-08-10,WOS:000440407500009,29992554,

Time-lapse 3D seismic monitoring at Sleipner in the North Sea has clearly demonstrated the practical usefulness in monitoring CO2 injected into the deep saline aquifers. Although sometimes it is unsafe to towed streamers when acquiring data in areas of shallow water or surface infrastructures associated with production platforms and fishing gears. That is why seabed seismic worth considering in some situations. In addition, the quality of time-lapse 3D seismic acquisition depends strongly upon the positioning of seismic sources and receivers. Improving the resolution of seismic data has been selected as the most important factor in increasing the value of seismic data. A permanent OBC (Ocean Bottom Cable) system offers a number of potential benefits for obtaining increased resolution by permanently deployed seismic sensors on the seabed or under the seabed. Compared to the towed streamer the permanent OBC also offers the opportunity to record shear waves, not only the P-waves.

While the cost of generated energy has just been reduced to £100/MWhr for offshore wind in the UK (4 years ahead of government schedule) deployment further offshore will increase both the capital and operational & maintenance (O&M) costs. in China, onshore wind power is severely curtailed due to crowded transmission corridors. Exploitation of offshore wind would better match the population distribution in China, and so hence there is a strong motivation to exploit this ORE. In order accelerate this development, new technologies are desperately needed to improve the performance in terms of cost, efficiency and reliability (availability). In addition to offshore wind, other forms of marine renewable energy will also play indispensable roles in the future renewable energy mix. Because these technologies are less mature, this development involves even higher risks. As yet none of the wave energy generation companies have shown to be commercially viable without economic support mechanisms. Recognising the high risks involved and the development work that is urgently needed in the industry, this project aims to carry out fundamental modelling and validating work that will lead to the capability of virtual prototyping. Such a capability will significantly accelerate and de-risk the development work in industry. Complementary expertise in the two countries are combined to address the requirements of overall system performance from ORE devices (wind and wave) to grid, and focuses on the critical technical aspects that will dictate the design decisions. This will be achieved through multiple scale (dimensional and time-wise) and multiple resolution modelling, taking into account the specifications and utilisation of materials and components in the designed systems subject to optimal control. The modelling will cover the manufacturability of the designs and will consider environmental constraints including impact on sea life in different locations. These will be important as ORE development is scaled up in the future. The outcome of research will be demonstrated through a series of case studies including both systems for large wind farms and wave arrays, and also small scale devices supplying energy to off-grid islands.The project members have long track records in modelling and design of components in wind and marine renewable systems. The project allows the researchers to interact and carry out studies cutting across the borders of different engineering disciplines, enabling hi-fidelity modelling and virtual prototyping.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,EP/R007756/1,,,,,,,,University of Strathclyde,,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:15403004,,

CO2 vents, areas of upwelling and downwelling, and potential leaks from carbon capture and storage facilities may also cause localised environmental changes, enhancing or depressing the effect of global climate change. Cold-water coral ecosystems are threatened by future changes in carbonate chemistry, yet our knowledge of the response of these corals to high temperature and high CO2 conditions is limited. Dimethylsulphoniopropionate (DMSP), and its breakdown product dimethylsulphide (DMS), are putative antioxidants that may be accumulated by invertebrates via their food or symbionts, although recent research suggests that some invertebrates may also be able to synthesise DMSP. This study provides the first information on the impact of high temperature (12 A degrees C) and high CO2 (817 ppm) on intracellular DMSP in the cold-water coral Lophelia pertusa from the Mingulay Reef Complex, Scotland (56A degrees 49'N, 07A degrees 23'W), where in situ environmental conditions are meditated by tidally induced downwellings. An increase in intracellular DMSP under high CO2 conditions was observed, whilst water column particulate DMS + DMSP was reduced. In both high temperature treatments, intracellular DMSP was similar to the control treatment, whilst dissolved DMSP + DMS was not significantly different between any of the treatments. These results suggest that L. pertusa accumulates DMSP from the surrounding water column; uptake may be up-regulated under high CO2 conditions, but mediated by high temperature. These results provide new insight into the biotic control of deep-sea biogeochemistry and may impact our understanding of the global sulphur cycle, and the survival of cold-water corals under projected global change.",,,,,,,,,10,1,0,0,10,0,12,,,0025-3162,1432-1793,,,,,,,,,,"Univ St Andrews, Scottish Oceans Inst, St Andrews KY16 8LB, Fife, ScotlandUniv St Andrews, Dept Earth & Environm Sci, St Andrews KY16 9AJ, Fife, ScotlandUniv Glasgow, Sch Geog & Earth Sci, Glasgow G12 8QQ, Lanark, ScotlandUniv Glasgow, Sch Life Sci, Glasgow G12 8QQ, Lanark, ScotlandHeriot Watt Univ, Ctr Marine Biodivers & Biotechnol, Edinburgh EH14 4AS, Midlothian, ScotlandScottish Assoc Marine Sci, Oban PA37 1QA, Argyll, ScotlandUniv N Carolina, Ctr Marine Sci, Wilmington, NC 28403 USA",,,,2014-07-01,WOS:000338285300003,,

We develop characterization factors for human toxicity for monoethanolamine (MEA) as these were not yet available. On the basis of the limited information available, our assessment indicates that amine-based scrubbing results in a 10-fold increase in toxic impact on freshwater ecosystems and a minor increase in toxic impacts on terrestrial ecosystems. These increases are attributed to emissions of monoethanolamine. For all other impact categories, i.e., human toxicity, marine ecotoxicity, particulate matter formation, photochemical oxidant formation, and terrestrial acidification, the CO2 capture facility performs equally well to a conventional NGCC power plant albeit substantial changes in flue gas composition.

We present data on probable impacts and recovery of these impacted wetlands. Based on numerous greenhouse and field studies conducted primarily in coastal Louisiana, we suggest that marsh vegetation will recover naturally without need for intensive remediation. Oiled marshes may reduce the availability of habitat for mobile fish species, resulting in their translocation to unimpacted areas. Impacts on benthic organisms may result in shift sin microbial community structure, but they will probably recover in lightly oil-impacted areas. The degradation rate or length of time oil remains in impacted wetlands depends on environmental conditions. Oil-impacted soils already contain adequate indigenous microorganisms capable of degradation under suitable environmental conditions. Nutrient addition, especially N, may increase the rate of oil biodegradation when sediment nutrient levels are low, but O-2 availability appears to be the most important variable controlling oil degradation in marsh soils. Oil impacts on sediment O-2 demand and restriction in O-2 exchange at the sediment-water interface can alter biogeochemical processes and gaseous exchange (CO2 and CH4) with the atmosphere. Even though there were harmful impacts resulting from the Deepwater Horizon oil spill, prior research has demonstrated that Gulf Coast marshes are resilient and can recover. This view is supported by field observations of new shoots appearing in heavily oiled marshes 1 yr following the spill. Even though this review shows that Gulf Coast marshes have a high natural recovery potential, many ecological processes have not been adequately quantified or identified.",,,,,,,,,33,3,0,0,23,0,45,,,0361-5995,1435-0661,,,,,,,,,,"Louisiana State Univ, Sch Coast & Environm, Dep Oceanog & Coastal Sci, Baton Rouge, LA 70803 USAUniv Florida, Everglades Res & Educ Ctr, Belle Glade, FL 33430 USA",,,,2011-10-05,WOS:000294810500002,,

However, due to lacking drilling data, the geological age and strata attributes of this area are controversial for a long time. Well CSDP-02 of the Continental Shelf Drilling Program is the first borehole in the central uplift, also the deepest whole-coring well in the South Yellow Sea basin. Based on the cores, well logs and multichannel seismic data, this paper clarifies the geological age and rock types of Mesozoic-Paleozoic strata in the central uplift. The strata below the Neogene sedimentary filling is the lower Qinglong Formation of Lower Triassic, the Dalong-Longtan Formation and Gufeng-Qixia Formation of Permian, the Chuanshan-Huanglong-Hezhou-Gaolishan Formation of Carboniferous, Wutong group of Devonian, Gaojiabian Formation of Silurian and Ordovician. Based on the drilling results, the distribution of Mesozoic-Paleozoic marine sedimentary strata of the uplift is defined and the long debate about the properties of marine residual strata can be ended. In addition, the reflection features and corresponding geological interfaces of seismic reflectors (T2, T8, T9, T10, T11) are inferred. Of them, T2 is the bottom boundary of the Neogene sediment system as well as the marker bed of the research area with high energy, stable waveforms. T8 is the Indosinian surface, which corresponds to the top of Qinglong Formation with high amplitudes and low frequency. T9 is a reflection of wave trough with high amplitudes and low-medium frequency, which we propose is the reflection of the bottom of Dalong Formation. With obvious energy variation in line XQ09-2, T10 is the reflection of wave peak and represented by medium-high amplitude and high frequency and T11 is a discontinuous reflector of Devonian. The strata distribution of the central uplift is influenced by the tectonic movement of the South Yellow Sea basin. Specifically, the strata are almost horizontal in the early Paleozoic with little faulting. During the Caledonian, the upper Silurian and lower Devonian are lost. Strata of Carboniferous-Permian developed extensively, the maximum thickness of the Permian is 1900 meter.

Their mode of preservation has been the subject of much debate. The lower Cambrian (Series 2) Emu Bay Shale biota, found at Big Gully on the north coast of Kangaroo Island, is by far the richest Burgess Shale-type (BST) fauna known in the southern hemisphere. Such fauna are preserved characteristically as two-dimensional compression fossils, comprising both carbonaceous and mineralised films on bedding surfaces of the host marine mudstones. The biotic diversity of the Big Gully assemblage suggests a habitat very favourable for life. Its preservation is exceptional, with gut remains and other soft parts quite common. Evidence of predation and scavenging is rare, and the finely laminated texture of the host mudstone attests to a lack of burrowing and bioturbation. Recent studies indicate that conservation of organic tissues, rather than authigenic mineralisation of their more labile components, is the principal taphonomic pathway responsible for BST deposits. In so far as such preservation requires suppression of the early diagenetic processes that normally result in the rapid decay of organic matter at or near the sea floor, the oxicity of the bottom waters, below which the Emu Bay Shale accumulated, becomes critically important. Here we determine the paleoredox status of the fossiliferous basal portion of the formation using selected trace element proxies, in combination with total organic carbon (TOC) concentrations and isotopic signatures (13Corg). We also establish its degree of thermal alteration as a datum for use in taphonomic comparisons with other Cambrian Lagerstatten. The Emu Bay Shale contains insufficient organic matter (TOC=0.25-0.55%) to have accumulated under stable anoxic conditions. Even allowing for the inevitable loss of organic carbon during the oil- and gas-generation phases of thermal maturation, to a present rank equivalent to 1.5% vitrinite reflectance, its original TOC content was 1%. Measurement of a series of redox-sensitive elemental ratios (viz. U/Th, V/Cr, Ni/Co and V/Sc) across the lower 8 m-thick fossiliferous section of the Emu Bay Shale confirms that it was deposited beneath an oxic water column. In this respect it is similar to the archetypical Burgess Shale.

They are the barrier lagoon complex, the transgressive mud beach, the Niger delta and the strand coast. The delta has provided the best conditions for the growth of vegetation and provides liability for the widest variety of trees and plants. There are no significant protected coastal wetlands in Nigeria. The greatest opportunities for in situ conservation of unique and threatened species abound in the delta area. Mangroves and fishes are the major renewable resources which have been managed using various conservation actions including legislation, regulation and mandatory environmental impact assessment. Captive breeding and culture are practised for overexploited and endangered fish species. Some problems mitigating against the conservation of aquatic resources are associated with coastal urbanization, oil and gas exploration and exploitation, industrialization, domestic and industrial waste discharges, the menace of water hyacinth, coastal erosion and difficulties associated with aquaculture development. There is a need for a clearer focus on the conservation of coastal habitats and ecosystems as a whole. Some recommendations are proffered as remedies against weakness in management and conservation measures. Research promotion and funding will encourage ex situ conservation of valuable species. Community participation and public awareness on the importance of the conservation and preservation of aquatic resources could be attained through proper educational processes. The importance of an integrated Coastal Zone Management Policy coordinated by a single government agency is advocated for effective coastal ecosystem management and planning for sustainability.",,,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,,,1018-3469,,,,,,,,,,,"Nigerian Inst.

We developed a Climate Change Sensitivity (CCS) indicator based on trait information for a selection of stream-and lake-dwelling Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera and Trichoptera taxa. We calculated the CCS scores based on ten species traits identified as sensitive to global climate change. We then assessed climate change sensitivity between the six main ecoregions of Sweden as well as the three Swedish regions based on Illies. This was done using biological data from 1,382 stream and lake sites where we compared large-scale (ecoregional) patterns in climate change sensitivity with potential future exposure of these ecosystems to increased temperatures using ensemble-modelled future changes in air temperature. Current (1961 similar to 1990) measured temperature and ensemble-modelled future (2100) temperature showed an increase from the northernmost towards the southern ecoregions, whereas the predicted temperature change increased from south to north. The CCS indicator scores were highest in the two northernmost boreal ecoregions where we also can expect the largest global climate change-induced increase in temperature, indicating an unfortunate congruence of exposure and sensitivity to climate change. These results are of vital importance when planning and implementing management and conservation strategies in freshwater ecosystems, e.g., to mitigate increased temperatures using riparian buffer strips. We conclude that traits information on taxa specialization, e.g., in terms of feeding specialism or taxa having a preference for high altitudes as well as sensitivity to changes in temperature are important when assessing the risk from future global climate change to freshwater ecosystems.",,,,,,,,,20,3,0,0,19,0,22,,,1674-5507,2396-9814,,,,,,,,,,"Aarhus Univ, Dept Biosci, DK-8600 Silkeborg, DenmarkAarhus Univ, Arctic Ctr, DK-8600 Silkeborg, DenmarkSwedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Aquat Sci & Assessment, SE-75007 Uppsala, SwedenUniv Nat Resources & Life Sci, Inst Hydrobiol & Aquat Ecosyst Management, Dept Water, A-1180 Vienna, AustriaAarhus Univ, Dept Biosci, DK-8000 Aarhus, DenmarkSinodanish Ctr Educ & Res, Beijing, Peoples R ChinaNorwegian Inst Water Res, NO-0349 Oslo, Norway",Sinodanish Ctr Educ & Res,,,2014-01-01,WOS:000335811900007,,

Even thought West Coast research shows that precontact ecosystems could sustain many times Current catch value, this still would not weigh heavily against other economic sectors. Single species management has failed to avert the depletion of many fisheries; hence, we now hear calls for ecosystem-based management as opposed to integrated management (used in reference to managing multiple sectors Such as fisheries, farmed salmon, oil, and gas, as well as climate change). We suggest that reintegrating ecosystem-based and integrated management necessitates the cooperation of other ocean sectors in generating the information necessary to monitor and restore ecosystems while ensuring that their own operations are sustainable. Currently, there are a number of scientific initiatives, ocean and biological observing platforms, and high-powered models to help develop new management regimes. We consider how this new technology could help to understand the collapse of eulachon Thaleichthys pacificus. Eulachon are of great importance to Native peoples but could well be described as the forgotten anadromous fish of the research community.

Rapid reverse weathering reactions during early diagenesis must be considered as a significant pathway of reactive Si storage in deltaic deposits.

A recent study, called MARINA 11, carried out for the European Commission considered discharges of radionuclides from the NORM industries to north European marine waters and their consequences. There are two main sources that were considered in the study. The use of phosphogypsum during the production of phosphoric acid by the fertiliser industry and the pumping of oil and gas from the continental shelf in-the North Sea which produces large quantities of water contaminated with enhanced levels of naturally occurring radionuclides. Discharges of alpha emitting radionuclides from these two industries have contributed significantly to the total input of alpha emitters to,north European waters over the period 1981-2000 (data were not available prior to 1981). Discharges due to the use of phosphogypsum have declined since the early 1990s and are now very low. Discharges from the oil and gas industries stabilised in the second half of the 1990s and are now the major contributor to alpha discharges to the region. As most European countries do not report discharges of radioactivity with the water produced during extraction, there is considerable uncertainty in the discharges used in the study.The impact of the discharges has been estimated both in terms of the effect on non-human biota and the radiological impact for people. In the 1980s the radiation dose rates to marine biota in the region around a phosphate plant on the north-west coast of England were as high due to the discharges from the phosphate plant as those near to the Sellafield reprocessing plant due to its discharges. In recent years the additional dose to marine biota in this region due to the past NORM discharges is of the. same order of magnitude as the natural background. The collective dose rate was estimated to determine the radiological impact on people. The peak collective dose rate from the NORM industries occurred in -1984 and was just over 600 manSv y(-1). The collective dose rate fell with time as discharges from the phosphate industry reduced and was estimated as under 200 manSv y(-1) in 2000. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

Its predictions were tested over broader temporal scales using data from static passive acoustic loggers, deployed in two consecutive years. Predictions of relative abundance (individuals per kilometer of survey transect) were obtained for each 4 km x 4 km grid cell, and compared with the median number of hours per day that porpoises were acoustically detected in those cells. There was a significant, but weak, correlation between predicted relative abundance and acoustic estimates of occurrence, but this was stronger when predictions with high standard errors were omitted. When grid cells were grouped into those with low, medium, and high predicted relative abundance, there were similarly significant differences in acoustic detections, indicating that porpoises were acoustically detected more often in cells where the habitat model predicted higher numbers. The integration of acoustic and visual data added value to the interpretation of results from each, allowing validation of patterns in relative abundance recorded during snapshot visual surveys over longer time scales.

Large Zostera marina L. beds throughout the Sea play an important role in its ecosystems and environments. This study reviews the long-term changes in the area of the Zostera beds, as well as some direct and indirect environmental factors which influence their distribution. In 1924, the area of the beds was 4,137 ha in the waters of the Okayama Prefecture, By 1989, 87 % of these beds had been lost. Industrialization and urbanization around the coasts of the Seto Inland Sea began in the 1950s. In the 1960s, the area of the Zostera beds in this Sea amounted to 22,625 ha. Since 1977, 70 % of these beds has been lost. This decline is attributed to: a) reduced water transparency as a result of nutrient load increases and intensive dragnet operations (reversible effects: modification); and b) reclamation by coastal development and port construction activities (irreversible effects: destruction). It is estimated that the former was responsible for the loss of 44 % of the Zostera bed area, while the latter destroyed 40 % of the Zostera bed area in the Okayama Prefecture, between 1924 and 1977. Both types of destructive effects have been restricted since the enactment of a law on the environmental conservation of the Seto Inland Sea in 1973. However, most of the Zostera beds have not recovered. Only in Ajino Bay in the Okayama Prefecture has there been an extension from 192 ha in 1977 to 710 ha in 1991.

The study was performed using transplanted bivalves Crassostrea brasiliana and semipermeable membrane devices (SPMDs) to measure PAH concentrations via bioaccumulation and in seawater.

However, the magnitude of carbon stocks and the rate of carbon accumulation (CAR) vary geographically due to a large variation of local factors. In order to better understand the blue carbon sink of mangrove ecosystems, we measured organic carbon stocks, sources and accumulation rates in three Indonesian mangrove ecosystems with different environmental settings and conditions; (i) a degraded estuarine mangrove forest in the Segara Anakan Lagoon (SAL), Central Java, (ii) an undegraded estuarine mangrove forest in Berau region, East Kalimantan, and (iii) a pristine marine mangrove forest on Kongsi Island, Thousand Islands, Jakarta. In general, C-org stocks were higher in estuarine than in marine mangroves, although a large variation was observed among the estuarine mangroves. The mean total C-org stock in Berau (615 +/- 181 Mg C ha(-1)) is twice as high as that in SAL (298 +/- 181 Mg C ha(-1)). However, the Segara Anakan Lagoon displayed large within-system variation with a much higher C-org stock in the eastern (483 +/- 124 Mg C ha(-1)) than in the central lagoon (167 +/- 36 Mg C ha(-1)). The predominant accumulation of autochthonous mangrove organic matter likely contributed to the higher C-org stocks in Berau and the eastern SAL. Interestingly, the CAR distribution pattern in SAL is opposite to that of its C-org stocks. The central SAL that receives high sediment inputs from the hinterland has a much higher CAR than the eastern SAL (658 +/- 311 g C m(-2) yr(-1) and 194 +/- 46 g C m(-2) yr(-1), respectively), while Berau has one of the highest CAR (1722 +/- 183 g C m(-2) yr(-1)) ever measured. It appears that these large differences are driven by the environmental setting and conditions, mainly sediment dynamics and hydrodynamics, landform, and vegetation conditions. It is inferred that quantifying carbon accumulation in sediments is a useful tool in estimating the present-day carbon storage of mangrove ecosystems.

This regulation of water column clarity also affects the growth of pelagic and benthic photosynthetic organisms. In addition, the presence of benthic vegetation, such as seagrass, can attenuate wave and tidal energy; thereby altering suspended sediment concentrations (SSC) and microphytobenthos (MPB) biomass that may secrete biogenic compounds that increase sediment cohesion. This work investigates the dual role of seagrass and MPB in altering the seasonal critical bed shear stress necessary to suspend sediment within a restored Zostera marina seagrass meadow. Research was conducted in South Bay, Virginia, a shallow (1-2 m mean depth) subtidal coastal bay on the Delmarva Peninsula. Hydrodynamic measurements including current velocity, wave characteristics, shear stress, as well as biological samples, light and SSC data were recorded for 1-3 weeks over 2 consecutive years during the spring, summer, fall and winter seasons. An in situ flume was used to quantify the critical bed shear stress during the summer by manipulating flow velocities and examining the shear stress and SSC response. The shear stress and SSC timeseries from the seasonal deployments was used to quantify the critical stress for other seasons. The seasonal deployments correspond to distinct seagrass growth cycles, where seagrass density during the summer can be 4 times greater compared to winter. Seagrass is well known to attenuate fluid energy, creating favorable conditions for sediment deposition and reducing SSC within the meadow during peak density. However, due to seagrass shading during the summer, carbohydrate, a proxy for MPB activity, was higher during the winter (9919 g g-1) compared to summer (843 g g-1). This potentially led to bed stabilization in the winter, as measured by an increase in the critical bed shear stress from 0.02 Pa during the summer to 0.05 Pa in the winter. These findings suggest MPB play an important role in regulating seasonal water quality, possibly providing a positive feedback for seagrass growth by maintaining bed stability during low-density periods, which primarily occur during the winter.

Mangrove forests are considered some of the most carbon-dense ecosystems in the world with most of the carbon stored in the soil. In order for mangrove forests to be included in climate mitigation efforts, knowledge of the spatial distribution of mangrove soil carbon stocks are critical. Current global estimates do not capture enough of the finer scale variability that would be required to inform local decisions on siting protection and restoration projects. To close this knowledge gap, we have compiled a large georeferenced database of mangrove soil carbon measurements and developed a novel machine-learning based statistical model of the distribution of carbon density using spatially comprehensive data at a 30 m resolution. This model, which included a prior estimate of soil carbon from the global SoilGrids 250 m model, was able to capture 63% of the vertical and horizontal variability in soil organic carbon density (RMSE of 10.9 kg m(-3)). Of the local variables, total suspended sediment load and Landsat imagery were the most important variable explaining soil carbon density. Projecting this model across the global mangrove forest distribution for the year 2000 yielded an estimate of 6.4 Pg C for the top meter of soil with an 86-729 Mg C ha(-1) range across all pixels. By utilizing remotely-sensed mangrove forest cover change data, loss of soil carbon due to mangrove habitat loss between 2000 and 2015 was 30-122 Tg C with >75% of this loss attributable to Indonesia, Malaysia and Myanmar. The resulting map products from this work are intended to serve nations seeking to include mangrove habitats in payment-for ecosystem services projects and in designing effective mangrove conservation strategies.",,,,,,,,,202,4,0,0,105,0,213,,,1748-9326,,,,,,,,,,,"Woods Hole Res Ctr, 149 Woods Hole Rd, Falmouth, MA 02540 USAISRIC World Soil Informat, Wageningen, NetherlandsGriffith Univ, Australian Rivers Inst, Nathan, Qld, AustraliaZool Soc London, Inst Zool, Regents Pk, London NW1 4RY, EnglandBlue Ventures Conservat, London, EnglandCtr Environm Fisheries & Aquaculture Sci, Lowestoft, Suffolk, EnglandUniv Calif Berkeley, Dept Environm Sci Policy & Management, Berkeley, CA 94720 USADeakin Univ, Sch Life & Environm Sci, Ctr Integrat Ecol, Burwood, Vic, AustraliaCATIE, Forests Biodivers & Climate Change Program, Turrialba 7170, Costa RicaKafr El Sheikh Univ, Fac Sci, Bot Dept, Kafr Al Sheikh, EgyptEdinburgh Napier Univ, Sch Appl Sci, Edinburgh, Midlothian, ScotlandUniv Washington, Sch Marine & Environm Affairs, Seattle, WA 98195 USAUniv British Columbia, Dept Forest Resources Management, Vancouver, BC, CanadaUniv Douala, Inst Fisheries & Aquat Sci, Doula, CameroonKyoto Univ, Grad Sch Agr, Kyoto, JapanSouthern Cross Univ, Natl Marine Sci Ctr, Coffs Harbour, NSW, AustraliaNature Conservancy, 1815 N Lynn St, Arlington, VA USAUniv Edinburgh, Sch Geosci, Edinburgh, Midlothian, ScotlandWashington State Dept Nat Resources, Olympia, WA USAKing Khalid Univ, Coll Sci, Biol Dept, Abha 61321, Saudi Arabia",ISRIC World Soil InformatBlue Ventures ConservatUniv DoualaWashington State Dept Nat Resources,,,2018-05-01,WOS:000431143300001,,

The number of tourists in New Zealand is increasing constantly because the environment of New Zealand is always kept clean and green. New Zealand is making many efforts to preserve the environment and these efforts are evaluated to be great. For example, the percentage of the environment-friendly energy is increased and enterprises are trying to minimize the emission of the waste. The awareness level of the New Zealand government and people on the environment protection is substantially high and most of environment technologies are being born in New Zealand because new environment technologies are always developed. Although retaining abundant coal resources, New Zealand is using the alternative energy to prevent the air pollution caused by the use of fossil fuel. They are also making many efforts in developing the technology that restrains the release of carbon dioxide that is caused by the use of fossil fuel, and the legislation of law for it is also active. CCS technology is the most substantive alternative for preventing the global warming and the confusion of ecosystem caused by the climate change. Currently South Korea is also making many efforts in developing the CCS technology and arranging CCS single bill in order to cope with the climate change. Therefore, the case of New Zealand, the environment advanced country, will give us many implications.The decree of New Zealand closely related to the CCS technology includes Resource Management Act 1991(RMA) and Exclusive Economic Zone and Continental Shelf (Environmental Effects) Act 2012(EEZ Act). It was confirmed New Zealand was paying careful and much attention in arranging the CCS bill. This paper is analyzing how CCS project contradicts RMA evaluated as the most important act in New Zealand environment law, and analyzed all complementary fields minutely to review the direction in which CCS single bill will go. The remarkable thing is that it was confirmed that it was easier to enact a new CCS single law than revising existing RMA. It gives many implications to us who are already arranging the CCS single bill. Another distinguishing thing is that it is agonizing even about general people’s safety as well as the relevant workers in installing and operating the CCS facility. It is judged through this that the government should reflect on itself seriously that the discussion on general people’s safety which is most important part is very insufficient while directing much energy to the communication with the public, and they should present an alternative.",,,,"뉴질랜드의 주요 산업 중 하나인 관광 산업은 뉴질랜드의 아름다운 자연 경관과 이를 이용한 레저 산업이 주를 이룬다. 뉴질랜드를 방문하는 관광객의 수는 지속적으로 증가하고 있는데, 이는 뉴질랜드의 환경이 깨끗하고 푸르게 보존되어 있기 때문이다. 뉴질랜드는 환경의 보존을 위하여 많은 노력을 기울이고 있으며, 뉴질랜드의 이러한 노력은 실로 대단하다는 평가를 받고 있다. 대표적인 예로, 뉴질랜드에서는 친환경 에너지의 비중을 높이고 있고, 기업들은 폐기물 배출을 최소화하기 위해 노력하고 있다. 뉴질랜드 정부와 국민들은 환경 보호에 대해 높은 의식 수준을 가지고 있으며, 또한 새로운 환경과학기술의 개발에도 박차를 가함으로써 환경과학기술의 상당수가 뉴질랜드에서 태동하고 있다. 풍부한 석탄자원을 보유하고 있음에도 불구하고 뉴질랜드는 화석연료 사용으로 인한 대기오염을 막기 위하여 대체에너지를 사용하고 있다. 또한 화석연료의 사용으로 인해 발생하는 이산화탄소의 배출을 억제하는 기술의 개발에도 많은 노력을 기울이고 있으며, 이를 위한 법률 제정도 활발하다. 이산화탄소 포집 및 저장(Carbon Capture and Storage : CCS) 기술은 기후변화로 인한 지구온난화와 생태계의 혼란을 막기 위한 가장 실질적인 대안으로 평가받고 있는데, 현재 우리나라에서도 기후변화에 대응하기 위하여 CCS 기술의 발전과 CCS 단일법안의 마련에 많은 노력을 기울이고 있다. 이러한 상황에서 환경 선진국인 뉴질랜드의 사례는 우리에게 많은 시사점을 줄 수 있을 것이다.뉴질랜드의 환경 법령 중 CCS 기술과 밀접한 관련을 맺고 있는 법령은 자원관리법(Resource Management Act 1991 : RMA)과 배타적 경제수역 및 대륙붕에 관한 법률(Exclusive Economic Zone and Continental Shelf (Environmental Effects) Act 2012 : EEZA)이다. 본고에서는 두 법률(RMA, EEZA)을 포함하여 본고의 원안이 되는 보고서에 언급된 주요 법령들을 살펴보았으며, 이를 통해 뉴질랜드의 경우 CCS 법안을 마련함에 있어 상당히 세심한 주의를 기울이고 있다는 결론을 얻을 수 있었다. 한편 이 보고서에서는 뉴질랜드 환경법에서 가장 중요한 법률로 평가받고 있는 자원관리법(RMA)과 CCS 단일법이 어떻게 상충되는지 분석하고 있으며, 더 나아가 보완 가능한 모든 분야를 세세하게 분석하여 CCS 단일법이 나아갈 방향을 정확하게 제시하고 있었다. 특히 이 보고서에서 주목할 부분은 기존의 자원관리법(RMA)을 개정하는 것보다는 새로운 CCS 단일법을 제정하는 것이 수월하다고 권고한 점이다. 이는 이미 CCS 단일 법안을 마련하고 있는 우리에게도 많은 시사점을 줄 것으로 판단된다. 또 하나 특징적인 점은 뉴질랜드는 CCS 시설을 설치하고 운영함에 있어 관련 근로자들뿐만 아니라 일반 국민에 대한 안전까지 고민하고 있다는 점이다. 이를 통해 우리나라가 국민과의 소통에는 많은 에너지를 쏟고 있는 반면, 가장 중요한 부분이라 할 수 있는 일반 국민의 안전에 대한 논의는 많이 부족한 것이 아닌지 이에 대한 진지한 반성과 함께 대안이 있어야 할 것이다.",,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,1975-0005,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2017-01-01,KJD:ART002269373,,

Therefore, in order to ensure the safety of the offshore CCS project, a strict HSE (health, safety and environment) management plan and its implementation are required throughout the project life cycle. However, there are no HSE domestic laws or regulations applicable to CCS projects, and the related research is insufficient in Korea.

First, this paper has analyzed ISO 31000, a generalized risk management principles. Second, we have investigated the HSE management practices of CCS projects in Norway and UK.

More energy-efficient fisheries are also likely to alter existing fishing patterns, which already vary from fishery to fishery and from vessel to vessel. The impact assessment of new spatial plans involving fisheries should be based on quantitative bioeconomic analyses that take into account individual vessel decisions, and trade-offs in cross-sector conflicting interests. We use a vessel-oriented decision-support tool (the DISPLACE model) to combine stochastic variations in spatial fishing activities with harvested resource dynamics in scenario projections. The assessment computes economic and stock status indicators by modelling the activity of Danish, Swedish, and German vessels (> 12 m) in the international western Baltic Sea commercial fishery, together with the underlying size-based distribution dynamics of the main fishery resources of sprat, herring, and cod. The outcomes of alternative scenarios for spatial effort displacement are exemplified by evaluating the fishers's abilities to adapt to spatial plans under various constraints. Interlinked spatial, technical, and biological dynamics of vessels and stocks in the scenarios result in stable profits, which compensate for the additional costs from effort displacement and release pressure on the fish stocks. The effort is further redirected away from sensitive benthic habitats, enhancing the ecological positive effects. The energy efficiency of some of the vessels, however, is strongly reduced with the new zonation, and some of the vessels suffer decreased profits. The DISPLACE model serves as a spatially explicit bioeconomic benchmark tool for management strategy evaluations for capturing tactical decision-making in reaction to MSP.",,,,,,,,,36,0,0,0,21,0,37,,,1054-3139,1095-9289,,,,,,,,,,"Tech Univ Denmark, Sect Ecosyst Based Marine Management, Inst Aquat Resources, DK-2920 Charlottenlund, DenmarkThunen Inst Sea Fisheries, Rostock, GermanySwedish Univ Agr Sci, Inst Marine Res, Dept Aquat Resources, S-45330 Lysekil, Sweden",,,,2015-03-01,WOS:000351837500008,,

We investigated how an established invasive seaweed species affected the biomass, eco-physiology, carbon and nitrogen storage capacity of native seaweeds at sites with a different environmental setting due to a persistent upwelling in northern Spain. We removed the invasive Japanese wireweed Sargassum muticum from intertidal rock pools once every month during a one-year period and used an in-situ stable isotope pulse-chase labeling to estimate gross primary production (GPP), nitrogen uptake rate, C-13-carbon and N-15-nitrogen storage capacities. Following the addition of C-13-enriched bicarbonate and N-15-enriched nitrate to the seawater in the rock pools during the period of the low tide, we sampled macroalgal thalli at incoming tide to determine label uptake rate. After four days, we sampled macroalgal assemblages to determine both label storage capacity and biomass. After one year of removal there was no change in the macroalgal assemblage. However, both the GPP and C-13-carbon storage capacity were higher in the turf-forming Corallina spp. and, sometimes, in the canopy-forming Bifurcaria bifurcata. Nitrogen uptake rate followed similar, but more variable results. Although S. muticum inhibited carbon storage capacity of native species, the assemblage-level C-13-carbon storage was similar in the S. muticum-removed and control rock pools because the presence of the invasive species compensated for the functional loss of native species, particularly at sites where it was most abundant. No obvious effects were observed in relation to the environmental setting. Overall, the effect of the invasive S. muticum on carbon flow appeared to be mediated both by the effects on resource-use efficiency of native species and by its own biomass.

Following the guidelines of the UNESCO-2001 Convention for the Protection of the Underwater Cultural Heritage, a holistic and interdisciplinary approach based on the development of four of the thirty-six Rules of this international agreement was applied. A non-destructive survey technique was developed to obtain information from the scattered cannons and anchors without altering their condition (Rule 4). The work performed provided information about the origin of both wrecks, the Fougueux and the Bucentaure, two ships of the line of the French Navy, and allowed to characterize the state of conservation at each site without jeopardizing their future conservation in the marine environment. In addition, measurements of the main physical, chemical and biological variables allowed correlating the conservation status at each site with the marine environmental conditions (Rule 15). Thus, in Fougueux shipwreck large iron objects are corroding at a higher rate (between 0.180 and 0.246mmpy) due to high sediment remobilization and transport induced by waves at this site, causing damage by direct mechanical effect on metallic material and by removing the layer of corrosion products developed on the artefacts. Meanwhile artillery on Bucentaure site, covered with thick layers of biological concretion, is well preserved, with lower corrosion rates (0.073 to 0.126 mmpy), and archaeological information is guaranteed. Finally, the effectiveness of the cathodic protection as a temporary measure for in situ conservation (Rule 1) was evaluated on a cannon. The use of a sacrificial anode after 9 months reduced the average corrosion rate (from 0.103 to 0.064 mmpy) and the percent of corrosion rate in 37.9%. These results are very useful for developing a decision making system of the Site Management Program, based on predictive models of artefacts permanence and risk factors in the marine environment (Rule 25).

The efficiency of Lophelia pertusa in rejecting local sediments and drill cuttings from the coral surface was evaluated and found not to differ between sediment types. Further results showed that the coral efficiently removed deposited material even after repeated exposures, indicating an efficient cleaning mechanism. In an experiment focusing on burial, fine-fraction drill cuttings were deposited on corals over time. Drill cutting covered coral area increased with repeated depositions, with accumulation mainly occurring on and adjacent to regions of the coral skeleton lacking tissue cover. Tissue was smothered and polyp mortality occurred where polyps became wholly covered by material. Burial of coral by drill cuttings to the current threshold level used in environmental risk assessment models by the offshore industry (6.3 mm) may result in damage to L pertusa colonies.

However, the ecological implications of such deployments remain unknown. Accordingly, this study is focused on the impact of tidal farms on intertidal areas and associated waterbird habitats in estuaries. A numerical model simulates the hydrodynamic conditions of the Solway Firth, comprising one of the most extensive intertidal zones in the UK. The effects of tidal farms with different turbine densities have been evaluated in terms of changes to the areas of habitat for wetland bird species of conservation importance. The results suggest that any habitat loss may be minor and that in some cases there may be an increase (also small) in the area of important habitat. The percentage change in intertidal areas is also considerably lower than that expected to result from tidal barrages of similar capacities, implying the potential for tidal farms to present an alternative solution for exploiting tidal energy in highly protected areas. The changes in the extent of intertidal habitat are not proportional to the energy dissipated by the tidal farm. Therefore a range of tidal farm designs should be evaluated in order to optimise installed capacity while minimising habitat loss. However, the site-dependency of the impacts and the complex responses to change of estuarine ecosystems reinforce the requirement for detailed studies to be undertaken for each specific location and array configuration. The methodology presented here is appropriate for such assessments as it can be applied to different locations and turbine types.",,,,,,,,,3,0,0,0,1,0,4,,,0308-597X,1872-9460,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Exeter, Coll Engn Math & Phys Sci, North Pk Rd, Exeter EX4 4QF, Devon, EnglandPlymouth Marine Lab, Prospect Pl, Plymouth PL1 3DH, Devon, England",,,,2017-06-15,WOS:000402213400042,,

This complex environment plays host to a critical biogeochemical flux, essential to maintaining shelf water quality and productivity. Utilising new observational techniques, the programme will build upon our existing knowledge to characterise and model the physical, biological, and chemical processes within the ocean-shelf sea margin, constructing a new paradigm of ocean-shelf sea exchange.The development of Glider and AUVS technology is widely regarded as a means to enable monitoring strategies that are both accurate and cost effective. This project will aim to ensure that ongoing developments in NERC Shelf Sea Science (SSS) can be used effectively by those working in connection with the implementation of the MSFD within UK, namely DEFRA and JNCC. The programme also aims to engage with members of the oil & gas sector, enabling collaboration and knowledge transfer to assist with risk management and monitoring, utilising new technologies within areas such as oil spill base-line screening, detection, and analysis. As such, two year KE project will work towards two main objectives detailed below. Objective 1: To strengthen the uptake and application of NERC SSS in the context of the Marine Strategy Framework Directive (MSFD) evidence base used by DEFRA.Objective 2: To facilitate the transition and application of NERC SSS in areas of strategic importance to the UK oil & gas sector.In order to achieve these objectives, the project will look to build links between the FASTNEt programme and industry and marine policy sectors through a series of consultations, workshops, and wider dissemination (i.e. social media). The project will facilitate new collaborative opportunities, alongside delivering knowledge translation outputs, tailored to specific end-users. This will be achieved through a series of key activities based on the six deliverables set out in the call document.1. Develop and execute an effective dissemination strategy based around producing showcase material and introducing social media management. 2. Build a broad network of key organisations across both policy and industry sectors to develop detailed understanding of end-user challenges and technology priorities, facilitating future collaboration and knowledge transfer.3.

During 2008-2009, the density of meiofauna fluctuated among the contaminated sites but did not vary by season. Seasonal changes in density were observed at contaminated sites 3 years after the oil accident Meiofauna appeared to be more sensitive to oil pollution stress at the more heavily contaminated site than at the less contaminated site. CLUSTER analysis showed that meiofauna communities in the 3 years immediately following the accident significantly differed from those sampled later. A non-metric multidimensional scaling analysis showed that nematode species composition in the first month after the accident significantly differed from those sampled later.

For certain offshore installations, CO2 capture and storage (CCS) could be an alternative to decrease the CO2 emissions. When opting for a chemical absorption CO2 capture system, a heat source for the stripper reboiler is needed. Since most offshore installations are powered by simple cycle GTs, there is typically no steam available that could be used for stripper reboiler heat. A compact steam bottoming cycle could, in addition to providing the reboiler steam, partly or fully provide power from a steam turbine generator to the equipment in the CCS system, including CO2 compressors, pumps, and flue gas booster fan. Three different steam cycle configurations were designed, modeled, and simulated. The design of the post-combustion CO2 capture system is also presented but the main focus in the paper is on the steam cycle design. In addition to the energy and mass balance results, a weight assessment of the major equipment was done with the objective to come up with a simplified weight relationship for changes in the oil and gas installation size in terms of changes in total mass flow from the gas turbines. A steam cycle with a back-pressure steam turbine was ultimately selected. The back-pressure option was able to provide all necessary steam and power (with some margin) to the CO2 capture and compression system. (C) 2017 The Authors.

Fish were collected from open sand-mud habitat (little to no relief), and artificial reef habitat (1-m(3) concrete or PVC blocks), from June 1993 through December 1994. In 1994, fish settled over open habitat from June to September, as shown by trawl collections, then began shifting to reef habitat-a shift that was almost completed by December as observed by SCUBA visual surveys. Stomachs were examined from 1639 red snapper that ranged in size from 18.0 to 280.0 mm SL. Of these, 850 fish had empty stomachs, and 346 fish from open habitat and 443 fish from reef habitat contained prey. Prey were identified to the lowest possible taxon and quantified by volumetric measurement. Specific volume of particular prey taxa were calculated by dividing prey volume by individual fish weight. Red snapper shifted diets with increasing size. Small red snapper (<60 mm SL) fed mostly on chaetognaths, copepods, shrimp, and squid. Large red snapper (60-280 mm SL) shifted feeding to fish prey, greater amounts of squid and crabs, and continued feeding on shrimp. We compared red snapper diets for overlapping size classes (70160 mm SL) of fish that were collected from both habitats (Bray-Curtis dissimilarity index and multidimensional scaling analysis). Red snapper diets separated by habitat type rather than fish size for the size ranges that overlapped habitats. These diet shifts were attributed to feeding more on reef prey than on open-water prey. Thus, the shift in habitat shown by juvenile red snapper was reflected in their diet and suggested differential habitat values based not just on predation refuge but food resources as well.",,,,,,,,,89,1,0,0,80,2,134,,,0090-0656,1937-4518,,,,,,,,,,"Auburn Univ, Dept Fisheries, Marine Fish Lab, Fairhope, AL 36532 USABarry Vittor & Associates, Mobile, AL 36695 USA",Barry Vittor & Associates,,,2004-04-01,WOS:000221182500011,,

The article also explores the UK Government's proposed changes to the regulatory regime. The article considers the key elements of the proposed CCS regime contained in the Marine Bill White Paper, released in March 2007. The UK Department of Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform (DBERR) has indicated that a new tailored CCS legislative regime will complement the existing regime. The White Paper includes options for modification of the existing legislation to make it better suited to CCS regulation, or alternatively CCS regulation via secondary legislation. The article concludes that UK Government's proposals for a new regime do complement the existing approval regime: however, there is still significant scope to amend existing legislation to further reduce the regulatory burden on CCS developers.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,1613-7272,1876-0104,,,,,,,,,,"SJ Berwin LLP, London, England",SJ Berwin LLP,,,2007-01-01,WOS:000212524600006,,

To help ameliorate this circumstance, top predators are being tracked to identify important ocean habitats, biodiversity hotspots and high risk areas and to assess effects of anthropogenic developments, pollution and environmental perturbations. We used GPS, Global Location Sensors (GLSs) and satellite platform terminal transmitters (PTTs) to track foraging and migrating thick-billed and common murres and northern gannets along with vessel surveys to identify potential Marine Protected Areas, to assess risk and to evaluate the consequences of the recent Gulf of Mexico oil disaster. Multi-year persistent sites of forage fishes generated multi-species predator aggregations. Species- and colony-specific winter inshore and offshore distributions of murres are associated with risks of climate change (ice), by-catch in fishing gear, hunting and oil extraction. Some thick-billed murres wintered in oceanic areas beyond the continental slope, and an area of high biological diversity was identified west of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge that, owing to its location beyond national jurisdictions, presents unique challenges for protection. Migration research indicated a substantial proportion of the North American gannet population wintering in the Gulf of Mexico near the Deepwater Horizon pollution area. Northern gannets incurred the highest incidence of oiling/recoveries and were the third-most oiled avian species; distributions and exit dates suggest that sub-adult birds suffered much, likely most, of this mortality. Environmental risk is being assessed by tracking combined with stable isotope and blood assays to probe trophic interactions, habitat relationships and to identify and protect biologically significant marine areas.

Three central themes emerge in relation to implementing the MSFD and the ecosystem-based approach to management in EU marine waters: (a) Boundaries: (b) policy and management coordination: and (c) balancing values and user conflicts have been explored. The paper concludes that from a governance perspective it is clear that the MSFD has not been that well-thought through. The consistency of the overall legal frameworks and specific regulations related to marine management have created legal vagueness and subsequently caused legal uncertainties leading to conflicting policies and regulations having unclear boundaries. Furthermore, it has been demonstrated the dilemmas facing various sectors related to MSFD implementation and shown how unequally prepared different sectors are to participate in this policy.

The list includes (1) montane rainforests; (2) tropical savannas; (3) tropical floodplains and wetlands; (4) coral reefs; (5) drier rainforests; (6) tropical islands; and (7) salt marshes and mangroves. Some of these ecosystems are vulnerable to widespread phase-changes that could fundamentally alter ecosystem properties such as habitat structure, species composition, fire regimes, or carbon storage. Others appear susceptible to major changes across only part of their geographic range, whereas yet others are susceptible to a large-scale decline of key biotic components, such as small mammals or stream-dwelling amphibians. For each ecosystem I consider the intrinsic features and external drivers that render it susceptible to tipping points, and identify subtypes of the ecosystem that appear especially vulnerable.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,978-0-470-65863-5,,,,,,,,,"James Cook Univ, Ctr Trop Environm & Sustainabil Sci TESS, Cairns, Qld 4870, AustraliaJames Cook Univ, Sch Marine & Trop Biol, Cairns, Qld 4870, Australia",,,,2013-11-27,WOS:000326402400021,,

Model results are analyzed at eight locations representing the meridional and offshore extent of the CCS between 31 degreesN and 40 degreesN. Thermocline strength, depth, and temperature are derived from the mean-level trend term and the seasonal component of the state-space models. Over the 44 years, the mean level of the coastal thermocline strengthened and deepened, while it weakened and shoaled offshore. These tendencies are likely the result of geostrophic adjustment to changes in basin-scale circulation, as well as to a long-term increase in upper ocean heat content of 2 - 9% throughout the study area. Reduction in nutrient inputs to the surface layer resulting from these climate signals are a likely explanation for the pronounced decline in biological production in CCS ecosystems observed over the same period. Substantial decadal variability superimposed on these linear tendencies may play a role in determining the response of the upper ocean to interannual events such as El Nino. The seasonal component of thermocline depth and strength exhibited a high degree of nonstationarity, with alternating periods of weakened and enhanced annual cycles lasting 3 - 5 years, along with changes in the phase. This changing seasonality may have implications for marine species whose life cycles are closely tuned to the seasonal cycle.",,,,,,,,,76,2,0,0,37,0,87,,,2169-9275,2169-9291,,,,,,,,,,"NOAA, Natl Marine Fisheries Serv, Pacific Fisheries Environm Lab, Pacific Grove, CA 93950 USA",,,,2004-10-30,WOS:000224883100004,,

From 2012 to 2017, we conducted four ship-based surveys of CH4 in the seawater column and boundary layer of the Bohai Sea, China, and further measured CO2 and several meteorological parameters. The average observed CH4 mixing ratios in the boundary layer and its concentrations in seawater column were 1950 +/- 46 ppb in November 2012 (dissolved CH4 was not observed in this survey), 2222 +/- 109 ppb and 13.0 +/- 5.9 nmol/ L in August 2014, 2014 +/- 20 ppb and 5.4 +/- 1.4 nmol/L in February 2017, and 1958 +/- 25 ppb and 5.3 +/- 3.8 nmol/L in May 2017, respectively. The results demonstrated that the CH4 emissions from the oil and gas platforms accounted for approximately 72.5 +/- 27.0% of the increase in the background atmospheric CH4 in the local area. The remaining emissions were attributed to landesea air mass transportation. Conversely, the influence of the airesea exchange was negligible, measuring within the 10(-3) ppb range. For carbon balance calibration, the mean flaring efficiency of the oil-associated gas based on the enhancement of CO2 (Delta CO2) and enhancement sum of CO2 and CH4 (Delta CO2 + Delta CH4) was 98.5 +/- 0.5%. Furthermore, the CH4 emission rate from the oil and gas platforms was 0.026 +/- 0.017 Tg/year, which was approximately 7.2 times greater than the sea-to-air CH4 flux over the entire Bohai Sea area. Thus, oil and gas platforms must be recognized as important artificial hotspot sources of atmospheric CH4 in the Bohai Sea. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

Recent efforts to constrain the saltmarsh carbon cycle have focused on the processes of carbon burial and sequestration with respect to sea-level rise and global warming. Simultaneously, many marshes that fringe the margins of estuaries and barrier islands are eroding, which releases old carbon from the saltmarsh and transports it into the estuary, and that process should be included in marsh carbon budgets. Additionally, if marshes cannot transgress the upland at a rate that balances shoreline retreat, then the marsh will narrow, thus reducing the area available for carbon storage. Here, we present the development of a box model that incorporates both carbon storage and carbon export via shoreline erosion to estimate the annual carbon budget of saltmarsh sediments. We test the model using field data collected at a fringing marsh within the Rachel Carson National Estuarine Research Reserve in North Carolina. The shoreline erosion rates along the fringing marsh are variable and the model output shows that the stretch of marsh that is retreating 0.76 m yr(-1) switched to a carbon source in 1930, while another portion of the marsh that is retreating more slowly (0.65 m yr(-1)) will switch to a source in 2021. The model indicates that the carbon budget of a saltmarsh is highly sensitive to the rate of shoreline retreat and that rapidly-eroding marshes may already be net sources of carbon. These results underscore the importance of conserving existing marshes, mitigating shoreline erosion, and considering shoreline erosion in the design of saltmarsh restoration projects.

Kelp forests provide a range of ecosystem goods and services (e.g. habitat for exploited finfish and shellfish, carbon capture and export, nutrient cycling, coastal defense), and improved understanding of the wider effects of environmental change on these habitats is vital to inform management and conservation actions. The structure of kelp forests in the NE Atlantic is changing in response to climate change and other anthropogenic stressors, with potential implications for the functioning of coastal marine ecosystems2. Specifically, the distributions of several canopy-forming kelp species have responded to ocean warming, with cold water species exhibiting poleward range contractions (e.g. Alaria esculenta, Laminaria digitata) and 'warm' water or opportunistic species have seemingly increased in abundance (e.g. Sacchorhiza polyschides, Laminaria ochroleuca) in some regions. This project will provide a robust assessment of the degree of recent ecological change in kelp forest habitats by resurveying historical sites and it will enhance understanding of how changes in the identity and abundance of canopy-forming species may affect the overall ecological functioning of kelp forests (e.g. productivity, energy capture and export, biodiversity maintenance and resilience).",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,2291757,,,,,,,,University of Southampton,,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:15298404,,

Four numerically dominant pelagic species (blackfin tuna, blue marlin, dolphinfish, and sailfish) were included in our assessment, and larval density of each species was lower in 2010 than any of the three years prior to the oil spill, although larval abundance in 2010 was often statistically similar to other years surveyed. To assess potential overlap between suitable habitat of pelagic fish larvae and surface oil, generalized additive models (GAMs) were developed to evaluate the influence of ocean conditions on the abundance of larvae from 2007-2009. Explanatory variables from GAMs were then linked to environmental data from 2010 to predict the probability of occurrence for each species. The spatial extent of surface oil overlapped with early life habitat of each species, possibly indicating that the availability of high quality habitat was affected by the DH oil spill. Shifts in the distribution of spawning adults is another factor known to influence the abundance of larvae, and the spatial occurrence of a model pelagic predator (blue marlin) was characterized over the same four-year period using electronic tags.

The contribution of different food sources to the diet of C. mutica was estimated using fatty acids as biomarkers. Caprella mutica was collected from three field sites, including sea cages stocked with Atlantic salmon Salmo salar, shellfish longlines stocked with the blue mussel Mytilus edulis and mooring lines marking the Loch Linnhe Artificial Reef (> 2 km from caged finfish aquaculture), where established populations of this species are known to occur. In addition, the fatty acid compositions of C. mutica held in aquaria and either fed the microalga, Dunaliella tertiolecta, or the diatom, Phaeodactylum tricornutum, for a period of 21 days were investigated. The fatty acid composition of the diatom and the microalgal diets was also examined. The results showed that C. mutica contained high levels of polyunsaturated fatty acids, particularly 20:5(n-3); other dominant fatty acids included 18:1(n-9), 22:6(n-3) and 16:0 (in decreasing order based on abundance). Significant differences in the fatty acid profiles between caprellids fed on the microalgae and the diatom diets and between C. mutica collected from the field sites were observed.

Thermal power plants account for a large portion of the world's total CO2 emissions and are therefore the most attractive target for CCS. For a typical thermal power plant; the process would involve capturing the CO2, transporting it to a suitable location for storage and storing it in a manner that will ensure minimal leakage over a very long period of time. Due to public concerns and protests regarding storage onshore, offshore geological storage of CO2 is most likely to be used for future projects (Winden et al. 2011). The successful implementation of CCS thus depends on the feasibility of capturing the CO2, transporting it to an offshore site and injecting it deep beneath the seabed. Pilot projects such as the Sleipner rig in Norway have already proven the feasibility of using offshore geological storage and post combustion technology for capturing CO2 can also be considered mature. No long distance, large scale transportation solutions for CO2 has yet been proven to work with satisfactory results. Transportation of CO2 is thus identified as an area where breakthroughs could lead to forward leaps in mitigating greenhouse gas emissions. This paper presents a study on a possible future way of solving CO2 transportation issues associated with the use of CCS.Geological storage locations are located in the sedimentary basins which is where oil and gas reserves are also found. The issue of transporting CO2 from an onshore power plant to an offshore storage site can thus be compared to the issue of transporting natural gas from an offshore extraction site to an onshore power plant or production facility. This is conventionally done using either ships or pipelines. This paper investigates the cost competitiveness of using the third alternative of Gas To Wire (GTW) where the gas is combusted offshore. This eliminates the need for transportation altogether and the concept has already been proven to be attractive for exploiting certain gas fields. It is shown here that the concept is even more attractive in a scenario where CCS is used since it eliminates two transportation issues. In this study, the transportation cost of natural gas and CO2 is compared to the costs of sub-sea High Voltage Direct Current (HVDC) electrical cables and is shown to be higher. Pipelines have a large potential to be the most economical way of transporting CO2 to most prospective storage sites in the future (Winden et al. 2011) and will therefore be used to represent a conventional method of CO2 transportation in this study. For comparison, the alternative of transporting by ship or using a pipeline-ship combination will also be presented briefly. Initial studies show that the reduction in transportation costs compared to all conventional methods would more than offset the increased costs of operating a power plant offshore. It is also shown that the gains in transportation cost will decrease the Levelised Cost Of Energy (LCOE) for an example scenario located in Western Australia.

This paper traces the evolution of planning frameworks, and proposes the use of traditional urban and regional planning concepts in artificial aquatic habitat management. ft is argued that aquatic habitat planning in the U.S., as interpreted by states and regional fisheries commissions, exists merely at the project level and has not suitably evolved to a holistic level as represented by either a comprehensive or systematic approach to planning. In response, a comprehensive systems framework is proposed which considers the role of onshore infrastructural support and offshore user and non-user considerations. The use of Geographical Information System (GIS) technology and its overall utility in planning and evaluation processes is discussed. The use of GIS can transcend present exclusion mapping procedures and make them temporally and contextually dynamic. This paper contends that a traditional focus on exclusion or negative constraints represents only an initial set of considerations, but must be followed with an inclusive analysis which identifies intended sanctuary or human uses within marine habitat priority zones. Finally, as an integral element of planning, evaluation activities within habitat management are traditionally based on biological dynamics and are executed on a site by site basis. The need exists to demonstrate intended habitat and fishery management benefits on a state or regional basis. A role for program evaluation techniques within the planning framework is emphasized to ensure that habitat program objectives are either being met, or adapted, to satisfy initial program goals.",,,,,,,,,6,0,0,0,2,0,6,,,0007-4977,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1994-09-01,WOS:A1994QB58400059,,

The study area spanned over 25 million km(2). For each species, the scientific name is given, as well as English and Russian common names, along with the following details: areas where species were collected, trawl type (benthic and (or) midwater), real or potential commercial importance, and possible product yield and minimum wholesale prices. Almost 20% of species in trawl catches had no commercial value, and >50% were cheap or very cheap (US$0.5-$2.kg(-1)). Only 3.3% of species were expensive and very expensive (US$10-$30.kg(-1)), and their numbers increased from north to south. About 33% of species can be considered as unexploited reserves for fisheries. These are mainly small fishes and invertebrates, with total biomass many times exceeding that of currently exploited biological resources. Product output for most species exceeded 90% of the raw mass. Occurrence of such species was much higher in the pelagic zone than on the seafloor. The most abundant local commercial species are characterized by significant natural fluctuations in abundance. Therefore, a sustainable fishery in the region can be secured (among other factors) by expansion of the assortment of commercial bioresources. A regional supply of bioresources provides such an opportunity. The checklist can be used for development of bioresource management, aquaculture and conservation, assessment of environmental damage caused by climate change, and (or) anthropogenic impact (including pollution, man-made hydro-technical constructions, oil-gas extractions, nuclear reactor accidents, etc.).",,,,,,,,,9,0,0,0,6,0,9,,,1208-6053,1181-8700,,,,,,,,,,"Russian Fed Res Inst Fisheries & Oceanog TINRO, Pacific Branch, Vladivostok 690091, RussiaRussian Acad Sci IO RAS, Shirshov Inst Oceanol, Moscow 117997, RussiaRussian Fed Res Inst Fisheries & Oceanog VNIRO, Moscow 107140, RussiaRussian Acad Sci IPEE RAS, AN Severtsov Inst Ecol & Evolut, Moscow 119071, RussiaDagestan State Univ DSU, Makhachkala 367000, RussiaTomsk State Univ TSU, Tomsk 634050, RussiaRussian Acad Sci CIBR DSC RAS, Caspian Inst Biol Resources, Dagestan Sci Ctr, Makhachkala 367000, Russia",Dagestan State Univ DSU,,,2020-09-14,WOS:000563772300005,,

Understanding the abundance, distribution and habitat use of species is fundamental for conservation and the implementation of management. Bottlenose dolphin and harbour porpoise usage of feeding sites within Cardigan Bay SAC was examined using passive acoustic monitoring. Acoustic detections recorded with calibrated T-PODs (acoustic data loggers) indicated harbour porpoise to be present year round and in greater relative abundance than bottlenose dolphin. Fine-scale temporal partitioning between the species occurred at three levels: (1) seasonal differences, consistent between years, with porpoise detections peaking in winter months and dolphin detections in summer months; (2) diel variation, consistent across sites, seasons and years, with porpoise detections highest at night and dolphin detections highest shortly after sunrise; and (3) tidal variation was observed with peak dolphin detections occurring during ebb at the middle of the tidal cycle and before low tide, whereas harbour porpoise detections were highest at slack water, during and after high water with a secondary peak recorded during and after low water. General Additive Models (GAMs) were applied to better understand the effects of each covariate. The reported abundance and distribution of the two species, along with the temporal variation observed, have implications for the design and management of protected areas.

Many platforms have large piles of cuttings lying beneath them and these probably present the greatest potential hazard to the environment during platform decommissioning and removal. There is, however, a lack of consensus on which aspects of drill cuttings are responsible for the adverse ecological effects. This hinders risk assessment of management options. Here we report data on the toxicity of sediments from around the North West Hutton platform to the amphipod Corophium volutator, the polychaete Arenicola marina and the Microtox (R), acute test system. Sediment was acutely toxic to Corophium out as far as 600 m from the platform. Sediment from 100 in from the platform remained acutely toxic to Corophium when 3% contaminated sediment was mixed with clean sediment. A 10% dilution of this sediment also inhibited Arenicola feeding almost completely. Sediment elutriates did not inhibit Microtox light output, but organics extracted by dichloromethane were very toxic. Fifteen minute EC50 values were as low as 0.25 mg ml(-1) and were strongly correlated with hydrocarbon concentrations. Metal concentrations in whole sediments were correlated with their toxicity to Corophium but the relationship was much weaker when data on dilutions were included. Except at sites immediately adjacent to the platform, metal concentrations were well below ERL values from the literature, so were too low to explain sediment toxicity. Toxicity of sediments to Corophium was closely correlated with their hydrocarbon content, even when tests on dilutions were included in the analysis. We conclude that hydrocarbons are the most significant cause of toxicity in these sediments contaminated with oil based drill cuttings and that polar organics, sulphide, ammonia and other water soluble substances are of much lower significance. Applying OSPAR guidelines to our data on the toxicity of cuttings pile material to Corophium data would give a maximum allowable concentration of 0.03% in clean sediments. The Microtox data indicate that sediments from deeper in the pile would require an even greater dilution than this. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

One of the biggest challenges with detecting the effects of oil-related contaminants on biota from resource development is understanding the background levels and potential effects of the exposure of biota to contaminants from various natural and a nthropogenic sources prior to large scale oil and gas operations. Seabirds are effective indicators of pollution, and can be useful for tracking oil-related contaminants in the marine environment. We sampled four seabird species (black guillemot, Cepphus grylle: murre, Uria lomvia: black-legged kittiwake, Rissa tridactyla: and northern fulmar, Fulmarus glacialis) in the Baffin Bay-Davis Strait region of the Northwest Atlantic and Arctic oceans, an area where natural oil and gas seeps are present but lacking any large-scale oil and gas projects. We found detectable levels of PACs and several trace elements in all species examined. Alkylated PAC levels were higher than parent compounds in all four seabird species examined, with fulmars and murres having the highest levels detected: mean hepatic concentrations of Sigma(16)PAC were 99.05, 46.42, 12.78 and 9.57 ng/g lw, respectively, for guillemots, murres, fulmars and kittiwakes. Overall, PAC concentrations in the seabird species examined were similar to PAC concentrations measured in other bird species in regions with more industrialization. These findings provide data which can be used to assess the current oil-related contaminant exposure of biota in the region. As well, they provide background levels for the region at a time when shipping activity is relatively low, which can used for future comparisons following expected increases in shipping and oil and gas activities in the region.

A multiplatform observational experiment was conducted in April 2017 to investigate, for the first time, the main hydrocarbon pathways from the Taylor Energy Site toward the NGoM continental shelves, and the Gulf interior, under the influence of local and regional physical processes. Results indicate that the Mississippi River (MR)-induced fronts over the Taylor Energy Site, in combination with local circulation, prevailing winds and broader regional dynamics determine the hydrocarbon transport. The drifters deployed during the field experiment, in tandem with satellite data, drone imagery, wind measurements, and radar-derived data, efficiently described three major hydrocarbon pathways, associated with MR plume dynamics (downstream/upstream coastal currents) and basin-wide circulation (offshore pathway). Two different types of drifters, drogued and undrogued, showed clearly different pathways, which suggest potential differences in the expected advection of oil, depending on whether it forms a surface slick or whether it is partially mixed below the surface. The existence of multiple river fronts influenced the fate of oiled waters, preventing the hydrocarbons from reaching the Delta, like a natural boom barrier, trapping and directing the oil either westward or eastward.

Recent geophysical investigations at Caesarea Maritima in Israel have discovered a thick, laterally extensive ballast layer in the area seaward of the 1st c. BC Roman harbour. The ballast deposits were identified by low-relief mounds on the seabed with elevated magnetic intensities. jet probing and excavation of magnetic anomalies at several locations revealed a 20-60 cm thick rubble layer containing large quantities of Late Roman and Byzantine pottery, local sedimentary boulders (kurkar sandstone, limestone cobbles) and foreign igneous and metamorphic boulders (granite, schist, volcanics; ca. 50%). The foreign boulders and pottery identify the rubble layer as ballast and ships refuse jettisoned by merchant ships outside the harbour. The strong magnetic contrast between the ballast deposits and the natural seabed sediments is attributed to the high magnetic Susceptibility (>10(-3) SI) of crystalline boulders and pottery materials within the ballast rubble.AMS (14)C and OSL dates and pottery evidence indicate the ballast accumulation began in the Late Roman period (ca. 200-330 AD) and continued well into the Late Byzantine (ca. 7th c. AD). The main phase of ballast deposition (ca. 4th-5th c. AD) coincided with a decline in the state of Caesarea's harbour following a destructive tsunami event in the early 2nd c. AD and records a shift to a more intensive use of the area seaward of the harbour as an anchorage and ballast lightening area. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

However other basins have increased their importance in the E&P industry where some operations are located very close to the shore in shallow waters with a remarkable environmental sensitivity. Because of this, a new approach has been adopted by Brazilian Federal Environmental Agency (MAMA) - firstly regarding oil spill preparedness and lately concerning environmental risk assessment.Risk analysis used to be developed as a preliminary hazard analysis (PHA) part of the environmental impact statement that operators (oil companies) have to perform in order to obtain a permit to operate. The main feature of this PHA was the qualitative and subjective risk assessment taking into account only the oil spill amount, in spite of the area sensitivity.Once the operations in those high sensitivity areas have potentially increased, IBAMA has developed a particular Term of Reference regarding the oil spill risk calculation for valued environmental resources such as marine mammals, sea turtles, fishes, etc as well as ecosystems (for example, coral reefs and mangroves).According to the new approach the environmental risk assessment regards to the recovery time of any valued environmental resource that could be affected by oil spill in comparison with the leakage occurrence time. The oil spill risk related to a valued environmental resource is calculated by the product of the release frequency and the environmental consequences based on exposure probability.This paper discusses this new approach adopted in Brazil, involving a quantitative method for the environmental risk assessment of Brazilian Offshore E&P.",,,,,"Global Conference on Civil, Structural and Environmental Engineering / 3rd International Symp on Multi-field Coupling Theory of Rock and Soil Media and its ApplicationsGlobal Conference on Civil, Structural and Environmental Engineering / 3rd International Symp on Multi-field Coupling Theory of Rock and Soil Media and its Applications","OCT 20-21, 2012OCT 20-21, 2012","China Three Gorges Univ; Chinese Soc Rock Mech & Engn, Geoenvironmental Engn Branch; Chinese Soc Rock Mech & Engn, Ground Rock Engn Comm; Chinese Soc Mech, Fluid Mech Comm; Hubei Soc Rock Mech & Engn; Minist Educ, Key Lab Geol Hazards Three Gorges Reservoir Area; Hubei Three Gorges Reservoir Area Landslides Observat & Res Stn; SW Petr Univ; NE Petr Univ; Wuhan Polytechn Univ; Hubei Polytechn Univ; CnTech Co LtdChina Three Gorges Univ; Chinese Soc Rock Mech & Engn, Geoenvironmental Engn Branch; Chinese Soc Rock Mech & Engn, Ground Rock Engn Comm; Chinese Soc Mech, Fluid Mech Comm; Hubei Soc Rock Mech & Engn; Minist Educ, Key Lab Geol Hazards Three Gorges Reservoir Area; Hubei Three Gorges Reservoir Area Landslides Observat & Res Stn; SW Petr Univ; NE Petr Univ; Wuhan Polytechn Univ; Hubei Polytechn Univ; CnTech Co Ltd","China Three Gorges Univ, Yichang, PEOPLES R CHINAChina Three Gorges Univ, Yichang, PEOPLES R CHINA",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,1022-6680,,978-3-03785-538-6,,,,,,,,,"UFRJ, Environm Engn Program, Campinas, Brazil",,,,2013-06-12,WOS:000318191700036,,

In line with the agreement with the UK government, who sponsored part of the FEED phase, the learnings have been shared publically for the benefit of future follow on projects. The project completed FEED in 2015, the same year in which the project was cancelled due to UK Government withdrawal of funding for the UK CCS Commercialisation Competition.The Peterhead CCS project FEED phase comprised design work for CO2 capture from the Peterhead gas fired power station using Shell Cansolv technology. The project design also encompassed pipeline transport of the CO2 through an existing pipeline to the CO2 subsurface storage site in the North Sea Goldeneye reservoir, utilising the existing offshore platform.This paper provides an overview of learnings from across both the technical and non-technical spectrums, including key technical CCS specific topics, as well as learnings from engagement with stakeholders, and development of regulatory frameworks. The learnings shared can be applied to the design of future CCS projects to reduce costs, optimise the technology, and realise public and regulatory support. The development of the FEED provided confidence that the construction and operation of the PCCS project was feasible and that the project was in a position to advance to the next stage of the development.

In the North Sea, both 'fixed-shift' (alternate day-shift and night-shift tours) and 'swing-shift' rotations (with a midtour shift change) are operated. The present study used survey data (n = 775) to examine sleep patterns over 3 'phases' of the offshore work cycle (day shifts, DS; night shifts, NS; and leave weeks, LS) in relation to shift roster, overtime, age, offshore shift work exposure, and anxiety. Specific predictions were tested in a mixed-model ANOVA in which DS, NS, and LS sleep were treated as repeated measures. Sleep duration and sleep quality were predicted by significant interactions of phase with roster, anxiety, age, and shift work exposure, but the patterns of findings differed across DS, NS and LS. Consistent with other published findings, personnel working 2-week nights-to-days swing shifts reported shorter DS and NS sleep duration than those working fixed shifts. Extended 3-week tours (7 nights/14 days) showed an advantage only for DS sleep. There was no evidence that LS sleep was impaired following night-shift work. Overtime was negatively related only to NS sleep duration. Anxiety predicted poor NS and DS sleep; the relationship between age and NS sleep quality was curvilinear with minimum values at 38-42 y. Shift work exposure negatively predicted NS (but not DS or LS) sleep. The results are discussed in relation to the initial predictions; more general implications of the findings, and methodological limitations of the work, are considered in a final section.",,,,,,,,,17,0,0,0,5,1,18,,,1076-8998,1939-1307,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Oxford, Oxford OX1 3UD, EnglandUniv Western Australia, Nedlands, WA 6009, Australia",,,,2015-01-21,WOS:000346635400003,25347685,

The multifaceted nature of the Blue Carbon concept has led to unprecedented collaboration across disciplines, where scientists, conservationists and policy makers have interacted intensely to advance shared goals. Some coastal ecosystems (mangroves, tidal marshes and seagrass) are established Blue Carbon ecosystems as they often have high carbon stocks, support long-term carbon storage, offer the potential to manage greenhouse gas emissions and support other adaptation policies. Some marine ecosystems do not meet key criteria for inclusion within the Blue Carbon framework (e.g. fish, bivalves and coral reefs).

The objective of this study was to quantify predation by North Pacific albacore on Northern anchovy in the California current system (CCS). I estimated the abundance of juvenile albacore in the CCS from 1966-2005 using stock assessment models and spatially explicit catch-per-unit-effort time series. Anchovy abundance (1966-93), both recruitment and total biomass, was obtained from a stock assessment model. Annual rates of anchovy consumption by albacore were calculated using diet studies of albacore in the CCS, an age-structured bioenergetics model, and regional estimates of albacore abundance. The range of estimates was large: albacore may remove from less than 1% to over 17% of anchovy pre-recruitment biomass annually. Relationships between predation and recruitment biomass were consistent with expectations from top-down effects, but further study is required.

The enriched communities were studied using culture-dependent and culture-independent (clone libraries) techniques. Isolated bacterial strains were tested for hydrocarbon degradation capability. Bacterial isolates included well-known oil-degrading taxa and several that are reported in that capacity for the first time (Sulfitobacter, Ahrensia, Belliella, Chryseobacterium). The orders Oceanospirillales and Alteromonadales dominated clone libraries in all stations but significant differences occurred at genus level particularly between the shallow and the deep, cold-water stations. Alcanivorax constituted 64% of clones at FSC135 but was absent at deeper stations. Pseudoalteromonas and Oleispira dominated the bacterial community at 500 and 1000m.ConclusionsThe genus Oleispira emerged as a major player in the early stages of crude oil degradation in deep-sea sediments of the FSC particularly at subzero temperatures. This finding is offering a direction for future research into biomonitoring tools for the detection of low levels of crude oil contamination in the deep FSC, and possibly high latitude cold waters in general.Significance and Impact of the StudyOil and gas exploration in the FSC occurs at depths >1000m but baseline environmental data necessary for the assessment of ecosystem recovery to prespill conditions in the event of an oil spill are lacking.

Using this framework, we identify priority areas for saltmarsh re-alignment: re-creation of saltmarsh in areas that have been saltmarsh in the past - but that have been claimed for a variety of land uses, particularly agriculture. We base our re-alignment prioritisation on the ecosystem services provided by saltmarsh in the North Devon Biosphere Reserve: specifically carbon sequestration and recreational benefits, and the economic values of those services. We compare potential economic benefits with the economic costs of creating new saltmarsh areas - specifically lost agricultural output, property damages and direct re-alignment costs.

This area has one of the greatest developments of oil and gas production in the world. This activity has generated significant impacts on coastal ecosystems due to the toxicity of spilled oil and the secondary and indirect effects of petroleum-related activities, such as alteration of hydrology. Effects on plant communities include disruption of plant-water relationships, direct impacts to plant metabolism, toxicity to living cells, and reduced oxygen exchange between the atmosphere and the soil. Effects on consumers include growth inhibition, reduced production, altered metabolic systems, and biomagnification of hydrocarbon compounds. Petroleum-related activities have contributed significantly to wetland loss in the Delta. Subsidence was increased by 2-3 times due to fault activation. Canals altered natural hydrology by altering water flow pathways, increasing saltwater intrusion, and reducing overland flow and sediment inputs. The combination of these factors increased plant stress and plant death. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

Mortality decreased following multiple sequential leaching periods. Toxicity decreased with increasing salinity. The fish were more sensitive than the grass shrimp. Dilution series toxicity bioassays were performed with fish and grass shrimp at 5 parts per thousand salinity and at 15 parts per thousand with fish only. The 96-h LC50s (lethal concentration for half of the test animals) for fish were 10% leachate at 5 parts per thousand and 26% at 15 parts per thousand.

Chemical analyses revealed no specific components as the cause of observed toxicity. Antagonism between sea salt and toxic chemicals is hypothesized to cause differential toxicity at varying salinities, as opposed to differential solubility of the toxicants. Extrapolation of laboratory results indicates that proposed tire reefs should not pose a serious threat to water quality in Chesapeake Bay. No observed effects concentrations (NOEC) were an order of magnitude or greater above field concentrations calculated from simplified methods. Toxic substances appear to leach from the surface of the tires not from the tire matrix. The use of tires in higher salinity environments appears to pose little direct toxicological risk to resident organisms.

In Carbon sequestration, the atmospheric CO2, produced by human activities, is removed from the atmosphere through natural processes and stored by terrestrial ecosystems in the soil. In Water purification, nutrients and other pollutants (i.e. metals, oils and sediments), introduced into inland waters and coastal and marine ecosystems, are processed and filtered out through water flow along forests, riparian zones and wetland.Land-use changes can have important effects on both Carbon sequestration and Water purification services.The aim of this paper is to identify benefits of the Natura 2000 Network to ESs in urban context; for this purpose we focus on a case study in the context of the Metropolitan City of Cagliari (Sardinia, Italy). The Natura 2000 Sites involve a thirty percent of the metropolitan land area and the results of the assessments of Carbon sequestration and Water purification show that areas including Natura 2000 Sites are highly potentially suitable to contain both ESs.The knowledge of the potential distribution and the quantity of ESs is crucial and can lead the decision-makers to a new planning approach, which is the key for sustainable urban development.",,,,,17th International Conference on Computational Science and its Applications (ICCSA)17th International Conference on Computational Science and its Applications (ICCSA),"JUL 03-06, 2017JUL 03-06, 2017",Univ Trieste; Univ Perugia; Univ Basilicata; Monash Univ; Kyushu Sangyo Univ; Univ MinhoUniv Trieste; Univ Perugia; Univ Basilicata; Monash Univ; Kyushu Sangyo Univ; Univ Minho,"Trieste, ITALYTrieste, ITALY",3,0,0,0,0,0,3,,,0302-9743,1611-3349,978-3-319-62407-5,,,,,,,,,"Univ Cagliari, Dept Civil Engn & Architecture, Cagliari, Italy",,,,2018-12-07,WOS:000451372400028,,

Plankton was collected by SCUBA diving once or twice a week during a 2-year period over a rocky artificial reef in the NW Mediterranean. Data on larval abundance were cross correlated with the values of environmental parameters (i.e. seawater temperature, solar radiation, wind speed and atmospheric pressure). In the laboratory, we recorded external features and main behaviors of larvae. We collected larvae belonging to 20 different taxa of sponges, which are among the most common in the sublittoral hard bottom communities of the NW Mediterranean and other temperate areas. There was a positive correlation between maximum abundance of larvae and highest water temperatures. Maximum solar radiation preceded the maximum of larval abundance. Wind speed showed no clear seasonal patterns and atmospheric pressure was overall the lowest when larvae were most abundant. Two main patterns in the larval release periods were observed. One was shown by species releasing larvae in summer, right before the maximum water temperatures (orders Dictyoceratida and Dendroceratida) and another by the species whose larvae release from the end of summer till autumn, when temperatures decrease (order Poecilosclerida). The larvae of Phorbas tenacior, Raphidoflus jolicoueri, Mycale rotalis, Tedania anhelans, Pleraplysilla spinifera, Aplysilla sulfurea var. rosea and Chelonaplysilla noevus are described for the first time. The larvae collected mainly belonged to the parenchymella type (except for the species Oscarella sp. and probably Cliona viridis) and showed different features and behaviors: from the elongated parenchymellae of Scopalina lophyropoda (order Halichondrida), which show simple swimming behavior and no response to light, to the parenchymellae of Poecilosclerida and Dictyoceratida orders with variable morphologies as adaptations to complex swimming behaviors. Our database will hopefully contribute to the present knowledge of larval types in sponges and definitively highlight the importance of this group in the dynamics of meroplankton from nearshore bottoms.",,,,,,,,,53,0,0,0,50,0,56,,,0142-7873,1464-3774,,,,,,,,,,"Ctr Estudis Avancats Blanes, E-17300 Blanes, GI, SpainUniv Barcelona, Fac Biol, Dept Anim Biol Invertebrats, E-08028 Barcelona, Spain",,,,2005-03-01,WOS:000228079700003,,

Three case studies are presented, from the Cretaceous Western Interior, the Devonian Baltic Basin and the Eocene Central Basin of Spitsbergen. All datasets contain extensive outcrop data, the Baltic Basin dataset also extensive core data.The paper aims to show that beyond the commonly recognized morphological features and the recognizable tidal facies, the main effects of tidal reworking of deltas are associated with delta clinoform morphology, delta lobe switching rates, delta progradation rates, and the nature of the delta plain. Strong tidal influence is here documented to promote subaqueous, rapid progradation of deltas, by efficiently removing sediment from river mouth and thus reducing mouth bar aggradation and fluvial delta plain construction rates. Such subaqueous progradation of the delta front is decoupled from shoreline progradation. The delta plain of such tide-dominated deltas consists of a few distributary channels and tidal flats. The delta front clinoforms become gentler and longer, as tidal currents efficiently transport sediment to the basin. Tide-dominated deltas tend to maintain a funnel shape and show low lobe switching rates, compared to fluvial-dominated and tide-influenced deltas.This paper emphasizes topographic restrictions or invaginations, caused by incision, delta-lobe deposition or tectonic uplift and subsidence, as significant controls on the occurrence of strongly tide-influenced deltas. The role of such topographic restrictions is twofold, by reducing wave energy and amplifying tidal energy. Significantly, such invaginations are not restricted to inner-shelf reaches as commonly assumed, but may also occur at the shelf edge, promoting tidal reworking of shelf-edge deltas. Moreover, in very shallow epicontinental seas, significant tidal reworking may occur throughout the basin evolution, independent on sea-level cycles or sediment supply. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Analyses in marine ecology found that the earth ecosystem could be able to complement nutrient silicon for keeping sustainable development of marine ecosystem, and decreasing CO2 concentration in the atmosphere; as a result, the area of desertification would be enlarged. Modern human being activities have resulted in constant changes in the amount of silicon transport from land into sea, leading to oversupply of nitrogen and phosphorus but silicon in seawater. The proportion of nitrogen, phosphorus and silicon was seriously imbalanced and the limitation of silicon for phytoplankton growth has become more serious. The silicon deficiency has damaged the marine ecosystem in coastal regions and slowed down the carbon sedimentation in the atmosphere of the world. The authors believe that the continual discharge of CO2 into the atmosphere is the cause for the global warming including marine water temperature rise. Consequently, the earth ecosystem would have to trigger its complementary action to resume to the silicon balance by algae bloom in seawater for reducing air and water temperatures. In order to complement nutrient silicon into the sea, the ecosystem would transport silicon via the atmosphere; therefore, the desertification in the inner land is a natural reaction. As marine phytoplankton booming can reduce the CO2 concentration in the atmosphere and further ease the green-house effect, during this process, a large amount of silicon are demanded by the ecosystem, which human being are unable to stop desertification from happening but slow down the progress and ease the risk. Therefore, as an important role in earth ecosystem, people should reduce the CO2 discharge into the atmosphere first; then, the normal function of river transporting silicon must be restored. In this way, the CO2 in the atmosphere can be kept in balance, the global warming slowed down, marine ecosystem development sustained, the drought in inner land eased, and the desert gradually under-controlled.",,,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,,,0254-4059,1993-5005,,,,,,,,,,"Wenzhou Med Coll, Sch Environm and Publ Hlth, Wenzhou 325035, Peoples R China",,,,2007-01-01,BCI:BCI200700214145,,

The work presented here estimates CO2 storage efficiency factors in CO2 EOR operations using a unique industry database of CO2 EOR sites and 12 different reservoir simulation models. The simulation models encompass fluvial clastic and shallow shelf carbonate depositional environments for reservoir depths of 1219 and 2438m (4000 and 8000 feet) and 7.6-, 20-, and 64-m (25-, 66-, and 209-foot)-thick pay zones. A novel statistical modeling technique incorporating the Michaelis-Menten function is used to generate empirical percentile estimates of CO2 storage efficiency factors.West Texas San Andres dolomite water alternating gas (WAG) CO2 flood performance data were used to derive P10, P50, and P90 CO2 storage efficiency factors of 0.76, 1.28, and 1.74 Mscf/STB (stock tank barrel) of original oil in place. Median CO2 storage efficiency factors from continuous CO2 injection following conventional waterflood varied from 15% to 61% and 8% to 40% for fluvial clastic and shallow shelf carbonate simulation models, respectively, while those from WAG injection varied from 14% to 42% and 8% to 31%, respectively. Variation in the CO2 storage efficiency factors was largely attributable to reservoir depth (a surrogate for reservoir pressure and temperature) and lithology (clastic versus carbonate). The results of this work provide practical information that can be used to quantify CO2 storage resource estimates in oil reservoirs during CO2 EOR operations (as opposed to storage following depletion) and the uncertainty associated with those estimates.",,,,,,,,,20,0,0,0,0,0,21,,,1750-5836,1878-0148,,,,,,,,,,"Univ North Dakota, Energy & Environm Res Ctr, 15 North 23rd St,Stop 9018, Grand Forks, ND 58202 USAMelzer Consulting, 415 West Wall,Suite 1106, Midland, TX 79701 USA",Melzer Consulting,,,2018-12-28,WOS:000425112900005,,

Despite increasing oil and natural gas exploration and exploitation, the deep ocean of Trinidad and Tobago is almost entirely unknown. The only scientific team to image the deep seafloor within the Trinidad and Tobago Exclusive Economic Zone was from IFREMER in the 1980s. That exploration led to the discovery of the El Pilar methane seeps and associated chemosynthetic communities on the accretionary prism to the east of Trinidad and Tobago. In 2014, the EN Nautilus, in collaboration with local scientists, visited two previously sampled as well as two unexplored areas of the El Pilar site between 998 and 1,629 m depth using remotely operated vehicles. Eighty-three megafaunal morphospecies from extensive chemosynthetic communities surrounding active methane seepage were observed at four sites. These communities were dominated by megafaunal invertebrates including mussels (Bathymodiolus childressi), shrimp (Alvinocaris cf. muricola), Lamellibrachia sp. 2 tubeworms, and Pachycara caribbaeum. Adjacent to areas of active seepage was an ecotone of suspension feeders including Haplosclerida sponges, stylasterids and Neovermilia serpulids on authigenic carbonates. Beyond this were large Bathymodiolus shell middens. Finally there was either a zone of sparse octocorals and other nonchemosynthetic species likely benefiting from the carbonate substratum and enriched production within the seep habitat, or sedimented inactive areas. This paper highlights these ecologically significant areas and increases the knowledge of the biodiversity of the Trinidad and Tobago deep ocean. Because methane seepage and chemosynthetic communities are related to the presence of extractable oil and gas resources, development of best practices for the conservation of biodiversity in Trinidad and Tobago waters within the context of energy extraction is critical. Potential impacts on benthic communities during oil and gas activities will likely be long lasting and include physical disturbance during drilling among others. Recommendations for the stewardship of these widespread habitats include: (1) seeking international cooperation; (2) holding wider stakeholder discussions; (3) adopting stringent environmental regulations; and (4) increasing deep-sea research to gather crucial baseline data in order to conduct appropriate marine spatial planning with the creation of marine protected areas.",,,,,,,,,24,0,0,0,20,0,26,,,,2296-7745,,,,,,,,,,"Nat Hist Museum, Life Sci Dept, London, EnglandUniv West Indies, Dept Life Sci, St Augustine, Trinidad TobagoDuke Univ, Nicholas Sch Environm, Div Marine Sci & Conservat, Beaufort, NC USAUniv Calif San Diego, Scripps Inst Oceanog, Ctr Marine Biodivers & Conservat, Integrat Oceanog Div, La Jolla, CA 92093 USAUniv Southampton, Ocean & Earth Sci, Southampton, Hants, EnglandUniv Rhode Isl, Grad Sch Oceanog, Ocean Explorat Trust, Narragansett, RI 02882 USA",,,,2017-01-01,WOS:000457690600340,,

In the Tarim Basin, NW China, carbonate reservoirs with resources about 38 % of the whole basin in a large prospecting area are mainly distributed in the Cambrian and Ordovician in central (Tazhong) and northern (Tabei) Tarim. Recently on the northern slope, Tazhong Low Rise, Central Uplift, Tarim Basin, a breakthrough has been made in the karsted weathering crust of Lower Ordovician Yingshan Formation and reef-flat reservoir of Upper Ordovician Lianglitag Formation. As a new frontier of exploration, oil/gas distribution and controlling factors of carbonate reservoirs in the Yingshan Formation are not clearly understood. In this work, play elements of the Yingshan Formation, such as seal-reservoir bed assemblage, oil/gas properties, and faulting, were studied by core and slice observation and field investigation. High-quality reservoir beds of Yingshan Formation are quasi-layer distributed in the interstratal karst belt about 250 m below the unconformity. The reservoir beds of fracture-void and void are formed by faulting, associated fracturing, and karstification. The Yingshan Formation is a large-scale condensate gas reservoir with partly oil. Owing to different oilgas infilling periods, isolated pools far from the faults are primarily oil in the Hercynian; oppositely, condensate gas reservoirs near the faults are intensely influenced by gas invasion during the Himalayan movement. Laterally, oil/gas distribution is controlled by stratal pinch-out and strike-slip faults. Vertically, cap rock of the third to fifth members of the Lianglitag Formation and Yingshan interior high resistivity layers are superimposed with Yingshan reservoir beds to form several seal-reservoir bed assemblages.

The total mass of Macondo-derived hopane on the seafloor in 2010/2011 was conservatively estimated between 2.00 and 226 metric tons, derived from 219,000 to 247,000 barrels of oil; or 6.9 to 7.7% of the 3.19 million barrels spilled. Macondo-derived hopane was deposited over 1030 to 1910 km(2) of the seafloor, mostly (>97%) in surface (0-1 cm) and near-surface (1-3 cm) sediments, which is consistent with short-term oil deposition. Although Macondo oil was still present in surface sediments in 2014, the total mass of Macondo-derived hopane was significantly lower (similar to 80 to 90%) than in 2010/2011, affirming an acute impact from the spill and not long-term deposition from natural seeps.

Most studies only assess eDNA which, compared to eRNA, can persist longer in the environment after cell death. Therefore, eRNA may provide a more immediate census of the environment due to its relatively weaker stability, leading some researchers to advocate for the use of eRNA as an additional, or perhaps superior proxy for portraying ecological changes. A variety of pre-treatment techniques for screening eDNA and eRNA derived operational taxonomic units (OTUs) have been employed prior to statistical analyses, including removing singleton taxa (i.e., OTUs found only once) and discarding those not present in both eDNA and eRNA datasets. In this study, we used bacterial (16S ribosomal RNA gene) and eukaryotic (18S ribosomal RNA gene) eDNA- and eRNA-derived data from benthic communities collected at increasing distances along a transect from an oil production platform (Taranaki, New Zealand). Macro-infauna (visual classification of benthic invertebrates) and physico-chemical data were analyzed in parallel. We tested the effect of removing singleton taxa, and removing taxa not present in the eDNA and eRNA libraries from the same environmental sample (trimmed by shared OTUs), by comparing the impact of the oil production platform on alpha- and beta-diversity of the eDNA/eRNA-based biological assemblages, and by correlating these to the morphologically identified macro-faunal communities and the physico-chemical data. When trimmed by singletons, presence/absence information from eRNA data represented the best proxy to detect changes on species diversity for both bacteria and eukaryotes. However, assessment of quantitative beta-diversity from read abundance information of bacteria eRNA did not, contrary to eDNA, reveal any impact from the oil production activity. Overall, the data appeared more robust when trimmed by shared OTUs, showing a greater effect of the platform on alpha-and beta-diversity. Trimming by shared OTUs likely removes taxa derived from legacy DNA and technical artefacts introduced through reverse transcriptase, polymerase-chain-reaction and sequencing. Findings from our scoping study suggest that metabarcoding-based biomonitoring surveys should, if funds, time and expertise allow, be assessed using both eDNA and eRNA products.",,,,,,,,,60,3,0,0,57,0,71,,,2167-8359,,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Auckland, Sch Biol Sci, Auckland, New ZealandCawthron Inst, Environm Technol Coastal & Freshwater Grp, Nelson, New ZealandUniv Waikato, Environm Res Inst, Hamilton, New ZealandKing Abdullah Univ Sci & Technol, Red Sea Res Ctr, Thuwal, Saudi ArabiaUniv Auckland, Inst Marine Sci, Auckland, New Zealand",,,,2017-05-17,WOS:000401845500009,28533985,

Studies have shown that there are fish species that are magneto-sensitive using geomagnetic field information for the purpose of orientation. Thin implies that if the geomagnetic field is locally altered it could influence spatial patterns in fish. There are also physiological aspects to consider, especially for species that are less inclined to move as the exposure could be persistent in a particular area. Even though studies have shown that magnetic fields could affect fish, there is at present limited evidence that fish are influenced by the electromagnetic fields that underwater cables from wind-mills generate. Studies on European eel in the Baltic Sea have indicated some minor effects. In this article we give an overview on the type of submarine cables that are used for electric transmissions in the sea.

They occur in an upper slope environment seen as 1-2 km circular features at the seabed. Seabed cores from the mud volcanoes contain oil, gas and sand/shale-clast content richer than the seabed background. Pliocene fossils have been identified in the cores, demonstrating transport of material from depth. The features show a high seabed seismic amplitude above a chimney of chaotic seismic reflections and data wipe-out. The mud volcanoes in the study area shows two distinct clusters located over deeper structural culminations.Four active mud volcanoes (Area 1) are located above a rollover anticline in the central part of the area. Cuspate listric faults reach the seabed on the up-slope side of these mud volcanoes. Four abandoned mud volcanoes have also been identified, with progressively older ages towards the crest of the underlying structure. These abandoned features are associated with an extremely chaotic seismic signature.A combination of over-pressured carrier beds and low integrity top seals are believed to be responsible for the formation of these mud volcanoes. It is further believed that gas expansion, subsequent to seal failure, was the main driving force for what must have been violent eruptions. The long lived mud volcano activity over the deep structural closure suggests a plumbing system that focuses on escaping compaction water and hydrocarbons through time.In the south west of the study area, another cluster of five mud volcanoes is located above a shale diapir. The seabed expression of the members of this cluster is more varied. Some show a positive relief at the seabed while others show circular depressions. The largest feature represents an assemblage of many smaller mud volcanoes with a common root system. Their seismic expression is also different from that of Area 1, with a well-defined sediment wedge at surface and a shallower root system. These features are believed to represent a less violent type of mud volcano characterised by ductile flow. Tectonic stress, due to growth of the underlying diapir, is thought to have played an important role during eruption, in addition to focused methane escape and the low mechanical strength of the overburden.

An unsupervised semivariogram textural classifier algorithm was used to enhance areas of smooth texture and low radar backscatter, indicative of these seepage slick targets. Complementary information related to sea surface temperature, cloud top temperature, wind velocity, and modelling for the tidal regime (all obtained as close as possible to the RADARSAT-1 acquisition) was used to support image interpretation and to exclude false targets also characterized by low radar backscatter (e.g., local upwelling, heavy rain cells). Twenty-one target areas were interpreted as seepage slicks. Considering the influence of the oceanographic and environmental conditions on drifting of the interpreted seepage slicks, they were spatially compared with available geological information, including seismically derived structural and isopach maps, and bathymetric data. Most of the interpreted seepage slicks occur in an extensional structural domain of growth faults. These structures are related to Cenozoic gravity tectonics that result from tensional stress in the continental slope due to the huge load of fluvial sediments transported by the Amazon River. Together with previously discovered subcommercial shallow water oil accumulations, the remote detection of seepage slicks is additional evidence of present-day generation and migration phenomena.

J,,,,,,,,,,,Geological characterisation of deep saline aquifers for CO2 storage on the UK Continental Shelf using borehole and 3D seismic data,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Awarded Grant,Sep 30 2009,2009,"Global climate change is the major environmental challenge today. In order to prevent a significant rise in average temperatures, the International Energy Agency calculates that global emissions of greenhouse gasses - primarily carbon dioxide (CO2) - will need to be reduced by more than 50% by mid-century. Alternative energy sources will play an important role, but the reliance on fossil fuels is set to continue. Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) is the most promising technology for mitigating the impact of fossil fuels. In CCS, CO2 is captured at power stations and transported to suitable underground storage sites where the CO2 is trapped away from the atmosphere on a timescale long enough for the atmosphere-ocean system to restore to natural levels of CO2 concentrations. The UK is well-placed to benefit economically and environmentally from CCS due to the proximity of power stations to potential offshore storage sites within depleted oil and gas fields and deep saline aquifers on the UK Continental Shelf (UKCS). The latter offer nearly twice the storage capacity of depleted hydrocarbon fields, yet the geological characteristics of deep saline aquifers - in particular the trap geometries, reservoir quality, compartmentalisation and sealing capacities - are poorly known. This project aims to use borehole data and seismic reflection surveys to provide improved geological characterisations of 3 deep saline aquifers systems, located in the Inner Moray Firth, Southern North Sea and East Irish Sea basins. These basins are all located close to sites of CO2 production, namely the major fossil fuel-burning power stations in eastern Scotland, eastern England and north Wales / northwest England. Specific objectives are for the student to: (1) identify locations and extents of potential structural traps within these aquifers; (2) use well-calibrated 2D and 3D seismic data to identify and map structural and stratigraphic heterogeneities within the aquifers (e.g. fault-bounded pressure compartments, distributions of high porosity facies etc); (3) estimate the likely sealing capacity of fault-bounded aquifer compartments with respect to CO2; and (4) risk the likelihood of leakage through reactivated faults during CO2 injection. The results of the project will be an important step towards realising the UK's CCS potential. The project will be underpinned by a new partnership between Durham University Centre for Research into Earth Energy Systems (CeREES), IHS and Badley Geosciences. The CASE partners have identified long-term commercial and scientific benefits of participating in CCS programmes and intend to use the project to build technical expertise in this emerging field. CeREES will provide the student with training in seismic interpretation, structural geology, seismic sequence stratigraphy and seismic facies analysis. IHS is the leading source of borehole data for the UKCS and will provide the student with access to selected well and 2D and 3D seismic datasets. IHS will provide training in petrophysical analysis and definition of well-to-seismic ties, which are essential to characterising the aquifer prospects in each study area. Badleys are the UK's leading suppliers of expertise and software in structural geology, with emphasis on quantifying fault seal and risking the likelihood of fault reactivation (hence leakage). Badleys will provide specialist training and software, which will enable the student to assess the sealing capacities of the aquifer prospects. DONG E&P, although not a CASE partner, is co-sponsoring the UK's first Chair in CCS and Energy at Durham University and is providing access to 3D seismic datasets from key areas of the East Irish Sea basin. The student will gain the necessary technical skills, industry experience and contacts to pursue a career in CCS and/or the hydrocarbon sector. The training provided by this project will also meet a previously identified UK-wide shortage of scientists with expertise in CCS.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,NE/G011222/1,,,,,,,,Durham University,,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:15304819,,

Latitude best explained variation in P. australis density, but contrary to expectations, density increased with increasing latitude across our sites. Latitude also predicted macroinvertebrate species richness, which increased with latitude in a manner similar to P. australis density. In addition to latitude, P. australis leaf carbon:nitrogen ratios, distance to the open coast, and sediment oxygen levels were most important for explaining variation in P. australis production, as well as community (plant or animal species richness) and ecosystem (carbon storage) variables.

Airborne bathymetric LiDAR, which utilizes green laser for measurement, however, is a proven convenient method for studying shipwrecks around the atoll, particularly in shallow-water areas. At a point density of about 3.5m by 3.5m, four shipwrecks were identified. The bathymetric measurements allow not only the length of the shipwreck to be estimated, but also its height above the sea floor. The full waveform record of the laser reflection also provided information to separate the wreckage from its surroundings.

Although remote, it is economically significant (i.e. petroleum extraction and fishing). Stakeholder engagement was used to source the best available biodiversity and socio-economic data and advanced spatial analyses produced 765 high resolution data layers, including 674 species distributions representing 119 families. Gap analysis revealed the current proposed zoning system as inadequate, with 98.2% of species below the Convention on Biological Diversity 10% representation targets.

The marsh sediment was incubated under an anaerobic condition with exposure to the crude oil or/and dispersant. The experiments were conducted in two continuous phases of nitrate addition to study denitrification potential using acetylene blockage technique and organic matter mineralization potential indicated by CO2 production in the sediment. Results show that the oil slightly (with no statistical significance p > 0.05) increased both the denitrification and organic matter mineralization activities, likely due to oil components serving as additional organic matter. In contrast, the dispersant significantly (p < 0.05) inhibited denitrification, but stimulated organic matter mineralization activities in the sediment due to unknown mechanisms. As a consequence, redox potentials (Eh) were much lower in the dispersant treated systems. The ecological impacts from the dispersant exposure may come from two fronts. First, loss of organic matter from the coastal marsh will threaten the long-term stability of the ecosystem, and the decrease in denitrification activity will weaken the N removal efficiency. Secondly, more reducing conditions developed by the dispersant exposure will likely preserve the oil in the ecosystem for an extended period of time due to weaker oil biodegradation under anaerobic conditions.

However, sediment OC can be released to pore water under anoxic conditions and diffuse into the water column. In carbon budgets of lake ecosystems, this potential OC loss pathway from sediments is generally disregarded. Combining field observations and incubation experiments, we quantitatively investigated dissolved OC (DOC) diffusion from sediments into anoxic water of a boreal lake. We observed substantial increases of bottom water DOC (26% in situ, 16% incubation), translating into a DOC flux from the sediment that was comparable to anoxic sediment respiration (3.3 versus 5.1mmolm(-2)d(-1)). Optical characterization indicated that colored and aromatic DOC was preferentially released. Reactivity assays showed that DOC released from anoxic sediment enhanced water column respiration and flocculation in reoxygenated water. Upon water oxygenation, flocculation was the most important loss pathway removing similar to 77% of released DOC, but the remaining similar to 23% was mineralized, constituting a pathway of permanent loss of sediment OC. DOC diffusion from lake sediment during anoxia and subsequent mineralization in oxic water during mixing increases overall OC loss from anoxic sediments by similar to 15%. This study enlarges our understanding of lake ecosystems by showing that under anoxic conditions significant amounts of DOC can be released from OC stored in sediments and enter the active aquatic carbon cycle again.",,,,,,,,,29,1,0,0,17,0,33,,,2169-8953,2169-8961,,,,,,,,,,"Uppsala Univ, Dept Ecol & Genet, Limnol, Uppsala, SwedenLeibniz Inst Balt Sea Res, Rostock, Germany",,,,2016-07-01,WOS:000382581900018,,

We trialed a novel methodology, CSIRO Ruggedized Autonomous Gigapixel System (CRAGS), for time series of high-resolution photo-mosaic (HRPM) imagery to estimate fine-scale metrics of human activity at an artificial reef located 1.3 km from shore. We compared estimates obtained using the novel system to those produced with a web camera that concurrently monitored the site. We evaluated the effect of day type (weekday/weekend) and time of day on each of the systems and compared to estimates obtained from binocular observations. In general, both systems delivered similar estimates for the number of boats observed and to those obtained by binocular counts; these results were also unaffected by the type of day (weekend vs. weekday). CRAGS was able to determine additional information about the user type and party size that was not possible with the lower resolution webcam system. However, there was an effect of time of day as CRAGS suffered from poor image quality in early morning conditions as a result of fixed camera settings.

Normally foreign vessels are required to conduct mid-ocean ballast exchange outside the Canadian Exclusive Economic Zone, however in the event that this is not possible due to safety concerns, ships may conduct emergency ballast exchange in one of two designated alternate ballast water exchange zones (ABWEZs) within Canadian Arctic waters. To date, ABWEZs have been identified in the Hudson Strait and Lancaster Sound regions of the eastern Arctic for vessels traveling westbound to the Port of Churchill or the Northwest Passage, respectively. A need for a third zone in the western Arctic has been identified, and is considered a priority given the renewed interest in hydrocarbon development in this region. Information on the ecology, oceanography, and shipping patterns in the Beaufort Sea region were reviewed to assess the potential risks of non-indigenous species introductions associated with ballast water exchange. In the Canadian Beaufort Sea there are extensive areas of ecological significance associated with upwelling in the Mackenzie Trough and the outer shelf and slope regions of the Mackenzie, as well as over the middle and inner portions of the Mackenzie Shelf due to the influence of the Mackenzie River plume and frontal features. Based on these features, ballast water exchange should be avoided from the longitude of Herschel Island (139[degree]W) eastward to the entrance to Amundsen Gulf (125[degree]W) and from the coastline to approximately the 1000-m water depth contour. Given the spatial constraints related to water depths and ecologically important areas, the potential locations for an ABWEZ are very limited, given the need to accommodate a linear ship track of 200-400 km long. Within these constraints, the waters to the west of Herschel Island at depths of 20-100 m along the route of most transiting vessels are incompatible with a potential AWBEZ because the distance from the Canada/US border is < 100 km. Farther offshore at water depths of 100-1000 m, starting from the Canada/US border there is an area that extends in a WSW to ENE orientation, however, travel eastward along this track is limited in early August by the presence of significant ice concentrations. Although a sufficient linear transit track (> 200 km) becomes feasible in this location by mid-September, this is well beyond the entry dates of most commercial shipping in August. Under present ice conditions combined with the water depths and ecologically sensitive area constraints, there are presently no feasible ABWEZ sites in the Canadian Beaufort Sea. In the event that future sea ice conditions are reduced and ice retreats farther offshore in early to mid-summer, an ABWEZ site from the Canada/US border east-northeastward in water depths of 1000 m or more north of the Mackenzie Trough would become possible. This area would be reasonably feasible for ships that may be travelling to far offshore oil and gas license areas for which exploration is presently getting underway, and for transit to McClure Strait north of Banks Island, which represents the deepwater northern route of the Northwest Passage through the Canadian Arctic Islands.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,1499-3848; 1919-5044,,,,,,,,,,,"ASL Environm Sci Inc, 1986 Mills Rd, Sidney, BC, V8L 5Y3, Canada",,,,2012-01-01,ZOOREC:ZOOR15304023182,,

The spatial and temporal dynamics of the logistics network is complex and dynamic and closely related to the magnitude, duration, type, and sequence of offshore workflows and activities. The purpose of this paper is to develop a methodological framework to quantify the number of offshore supply vessel and crew boat departures by activity across the Gulfs coastal regions in support of the oil and gas industry. The logistics network is modeled as a linear time-invariant deterministic system and implemented using an input-output model. We provide a methodological framework to quantify the magnitude and distribution of service vessel trips to forecast port activity.

For loggerhead turtles (Caretta caretta) nesting at the Wreck Rock rookery, adjacent to Deepwater National Park in south-east Queensland, yellow-spotted goannas (Varanus panoptes) are the main nest predator. However, no studies have documented the space use of goannas in costal habitat adjacent to a sea turtle nesting beach. Here we used Global Positioning System data loggers to evaluate the spatial ecology of adult yellow-spotted goannas in order to discover their potential interaction with sea turtle nests. Male yellow-spotted goannas had larger home ranges, spent a greater proportion of their time in the beach dune area where sea turtles nest, and their home ranges overlapped with more sea turtle nests compared with females. Both males and females had a bimodal activity pattern, with peaks in activity in the early morning and mid to late afternoon. Examination of space-use patterns indicates that it is the larger male yellow-spotted goannas that are the main predators of sea turtle nests at the Wreck Rock beach-nesting aggregation. Hence, by inference, it is probable that large male yellow-spotted goannas are responsible for opening nests at other Australian mainland sea turtle beaches, and if a goanna-specific management strategy is implemented to control predation it is these large males that should be targeted.",,,,,,,,,13,0,0,0,13,0,13,,,0004-959X,1446-5698,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Queensland, Sch Biol Sci, St Lucia, Qld, Australia",,,,2017-09-07,WOS:000408652600002,,

Emphasis was on the 170 km long Kasegaluk Lagoon, which was known to be regularly used by both species during the open-water season. Belugas were seen on every survey during 3-14 July 1990 and 4-16 July 1991, with numbers ranging from 7 to 1212. Data from other years indicate that whales sometimes arrive as early as 22 June and leave the area by late July. The presence of nearshore gravel beds and warm, low-salinity water probably combine to make this region important as a place for belugas to molt. Spotted seals occur in the area from mid-July through early November. They haul out on particular spits and shoals near Utukok Pass, Akoliakatat Pass, and Avak Inlet. Numbers counted were variable but exceeded 1000 on many days in July, August, and September. Telemetry data suggest that the maximum count of about 2200 represents only a small portion of the total number of seals frequenting Kasegaluk Lagoon. Comparisons with data from previous years suggest that the numbers of belugas and spotted seals using the area have been relatively stable since the late 1970s. Activities associated with oil, gas, coal, and mineral resource development should be regulated to minimize their potential impacts on important beluga and spotted seal habitats.",,,,,,,,,33,0,1,0,19,0,39,,,0004-0843,,,,,,,,,,,"ALASKA DEPT FISH & GAME,BARROW,AK 99508",,,,1993-03-01,WOS:A1993KU60500003,,

Solar PV/T technology can cater the offshore energy requirement substantially. However Levelized Cost Of Energy (LCOE) of Solar per kWh is more than that of any other renewable energy, but mobility, portability and feasibility of offshore installations are the key factors which dominate amongst the renewable energy sources.

As our global environment changes, due to natural variation and human activities, it is important to try to understand what these changes are, why they are happening and what effect they will have on the ecosystems and, therefore, the subsequent impact upon society. Modelling is an important tool in this respect as mathematical simulations of key biological and chemical processes are developed in order to predict a range of scenarios, from the workings of a food web to how a spill event may progress. These informed predictions can then be used to assist environmental managers and policy makers in developing sustainable management strategies. By comparing model results with real observations, we can assess our current understanding and help us to target future research effort at the gaps in our knowledge. Ecosystem models are only as good as the knowledge base and data that lies behind them. PML maintains the Western Channel Observatory (WCO) to study, in the context of global climate change, the regional effects of ecosystem variability in the western English Channel. There is a long history of in situ observation at several stations in the area; these include hydrography, nutrients, phytoplankton, zooplankton, demersal and pelagic fish, and benthic measurements. This range of observations makes it an exceptional area for investigating long-term change and validating ecosystem models. Key research areas include: a) coupled hydrodynamic ecosystem models; b) the changing marine environment; c) monitoring and validation; d) forecasting; e) sediments; f) carbon capture and storage.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,pml010006,,,,,,,,Plymouth Marine Laboratory,,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:15329481,,

Since then, the use of artificial structure has become widespread throughout the country in a variety of waters and fish communities. Proposed advantages of installing artificial structure include increasing angler catch per effort, providing cover to increase survival of juvenile fish, and providing spawning habitat to increase natural production. Structure materials vary from brush piles and evergreen trees, to tires, hay bales, and manufactured plastic forms. The most effective types of artificial structure resemble natural structure with varied complexity and interstitial spaces. The success of structure projects is dependent upon the type of fish community present, the slope and depth at which the structure is placed, the amount and size of structure installed, and the type of structure that will best meet the goals of the project. The most successful structure projects are those which are implemented with clearly defined management goals.

J,,,,,,,,,"He, Ruoying",,Collaborative Research: An Observational and Modeling Study of the Physical Processes Driving Exchanges between the Shelf and the Deep Ocean At Cape Hatteras,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Awarded Grant,Apr 01 2016,2016,"Recent unusual conditions along the U.S. East Coast have dramatically demonstrated the importance of understanding the dynamics controlling shelf-deep ocean exchange at the confluence of the North Atlantic gyres near Cape Hatteras. Atypical Gulf Stream position, air-sea heat flux, extremes in ocean temperature, and sea level rise are potential harbingers of larger shifts in atmospheric and oceanic forcing. Effects on shelf-deep ocean exchange are unknown due to incomplete dynamical understanding of the present. Development of predictive capacity is particularly relevant at this time, as oil and gas exploration is being planned. The understanding of shelf-deep ocean exchange gained through this project will be applicable to other regions where shelf and basin-scale currents converge and could improve our capacity to anticipate the response of the coastal ocean to climate change in the coming decades. In addition to the physical interactions between scales and oceanic regions, the relevance of exported shelf waters at Cape Hatteras to global carbon budgets may be large, and is difficult to quantify due to carbon budget mediation by biological ecosystems that vary with season and water mass. Both ecosystems and export processes may change under predicted climatic shifts, so understanding export processes has broad biogeochemical importance. Collaborations with biogeochemists and ecologists will be pursued to utilize the data to study ecosystems in this area of high biological diversity that is home to many commercially important species. Insights gained through the project will also improve mitigation of pollutant spills. The outreach and educational efforts include a public exhibit and talks, opportunities for joining science cruises and participation in the Society of Women Engineers Girls Engineer It! Day, a daylong event for girls in grades 6-12, and the Wood Hole Oceanographic Institution's summer program for undergraduates from underrepresented groups. The project will support two early career scientists, train one postdoctoral researcher and four graduate students, and give undergraduate students hands-on experience in the operation of the autonomous gliders. Subtropical and subpolar oceanic gyre boundaries are characterized by confluent western boundary currents and convergence in the adjacent shelf and slope waters. Together, they lead to large net export of shelf waters to the deep ocean, and complex, bidirectional shelf-deep ocean exchange, in response to strong forcing typical of mid-latitude western ocean margins. Shelf-deep ocean exchange processes at such dynamic sites remain poorly understood, due in part to the technical challenge of resolving broad ranges of relevant spatial and temporal scales. The understanding gained by investigating the wide seasonal range of parameter space will facilitate exploration of how shelf circulation and shelf-open ocean exchange may evolve due to observed and projected long-term shifts in regional and basin-scale circulation, hydrography, and atmospheric forcing. This project will deploy fixed, mobile, and remote observational platforms in combination with idealized and realistic numerical simulations to investigate exchange processes near Cape Hatteras. The sampling array will provide an observational data set with unprecedented temporal and spatial resolution in a region of large episodic export and exchange. These observations will be used to identify dominant exchange processes; correlate them with observed forcing; define ranges of forcing and shelf response; verify parallel developments within the realistic model framework; and establish causation through detailed assessment of momentum and vorticity balances, integrating observational and validated model products. In addition to physical data, the autonomous gliders will also collect chlorophyll fluorescence, oxygen saturation, and acoustic backscatter data that are of direct relevance to biogeochemical properties exported from the shelf to the deep ocean. These non-physical data will be used as water mass tracers and to portray the structure of the chlorophyll-a and dissolved oxygen at unprecedented resolution.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,1559178,,,,,,,,North Carolina State University,,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:13969055,,

The job will require help from the government, electric operator and manufacturers. The domestic offshore wind farm market will boost global competitiveness up until 2019.This research analyzes the economic impact of the offshore wind farm project. The local acceptance in terms of production, employment and value added are expected to be maximized. According to the quantitative analysis using the extended 2010 input-output table, we calculated that the production inducement impact will reach up to 13.5 trillion won. 11.07 trillion won from the offshore wind farm industry and 2.4 trillion won from others. Furthermore the impact of increase in employment is expected to reach 22,662. 9,883 will be from the wind farm industry and 12,779 from other fields. The impact is expected to be greater especially during the middle of the jobless growth period, Lastly, the value added inducement impact is expected to be 4.24 trillion won.Regarding economic impacts, strategies required for increasing local acceptance are as follows. First, in order to diversify and sophisticate the primary industry into a secondary or tertiary one, we need to develop the nearby wind farm site into a wind farm thema park. Attracting the wind farm production, installing and maintaining/repairing firms and establishing an experience center for K-12 students by providing them an education center for offshore wind energy can be specific means of development. Also, during the operation and after the destruction of facilities, the government should lay out the sub-structure of the wind farm as a sea ranch. Thirdly, the level of local acceptance regarding the community ownership of the offshore wind farm should increase to those of Middelgrunden(Denmark) and Navarra(Spain). Considering the economic condition of Buan, Gochang and the Yeonggwang area, community ownership is one of best solutions for the increment of local tax revenue. At last, considering the supports system of areas adjacent to power plants and 'Partnership management with local community’, the offshore wind farm operator may need to provide assistant policies to nearby communities. The policies should be based on Corporate Social Responsibility(CSR) such as education scholarship projects, local economy cooperative projects, sports/culture projects.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,1738-1592,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2014-01-01,KJD:ART001923265,,

This paper presents the key elements and processes of the microbial shallow gas system in the Plio-Pleistocene Dutch Southern North Sea Delta based on recent findings from different projects. Geochemical and carbon isotopic composition of shallow gas occurrences in the delta are indicative of a microbial origin of the gas. Shallow gas mainly occurs in stratigraphic traps and stacked anticlinal structures above salt structures, as indicated by identified direct hydrocarbon indicators on seismic, such as bright spots. Organic matter in the delta deposits is of predominantly land plant origin with TOC values varying between < 1% and 5%, and mostly between 1 and 2%. Simulations of temperature and burial history in combination with dedicated 1D simulations of microbial gas generation reveal that gas generation in the delta started in Early Pleistocene Calabrian times and is still ongoing. Simulated volumes of gas generation are more than enough to fill published estimated volumes of shallow gas prospects in the delta. The geometry of the E-W prograding delta sequences and the close interbedding of interglacial silty/sandy and glacial clayey/silty sediments focus gas migration updip through the foresets towards the topsets of the delta sequences, and ultimately into the anticlinal stacked traps. Grain-size based calculations of the permeability and capillary seal capacity of clayey/silty seals of the stratigraphic and anticlinal traps provided first estimates of permeability values ranging from 2.8E-20 m(2) to 1.1E-18 m(2) and capillary seal capacity values between 10m and 24m. Comparison of gas column heights derived from grain-size based calculations, cross plots of neutron and density logs and pressure measurements, with trap heights derived from seismic bright spots suggests that many traps in stacked bright spots are not filled to structural spill point. This suggests that filling of the stacked reservoirs is not related to fill spill migration, but rather to leakage through the top seal. In absence of fault and fracture zones crossing the seal, this leakage is related to the capillary seal capacity and permeability of the top seal. The leakage extends, locally, to the seabed.The microbial gas system in the delta today is a highly dynamic system driven by ongoing burial of the delta sediments and microbial gas generation.",,,,,,,,,12,0,0,0,1,0,12,,,0264-8172,1873-4073,,,,,,,,,,"TNO Netherlands Org Appl Sci Res, Princetonlaan 6, NL-3584 CB Utrecht, NetherlandsUniv Utrecht, Dept Phys Geog, Fac Geosci, Princetonlaan 8a, NL-3584 CB Utrecht, Netherlands",,,,2018-11-16,WOS:000449128000033,,

In recent years, this trend has increased for the planet's seas. In order to further maximize the utility of marine space, the concept of co-location between economic sectors operating in the sea, and coexistence of such sectors with the ecosystem, has provided traction for the concept of multi-use (MU). In response, the European Union Horizon 2020 programme funded the Multi-Use in European Seas (MUSES) project which aims to provide innovative technical and policy solutions to facilitate MU in the five European sea basins. Within the broader analytical framework of MUSES, 10 case studies were developed to determine the potentials and effects of MU for various sectors. This paper examines MU between tidal energy development and environmental protection, as well as tidal energy development and environmental monitoring. A desk analysis provided for known drivers, added values, barriers, and impacts of MU. Results from the desk analysis were validated by key stakeholders, resulting in policy and technical recommendations informing the MUSES Action Plan. The analysis demonstrates that technological advancements to monitoring equipment are required to further studies of environmental interactions with tidal energy arrays, and determine the viability of co-locating developments in environmentally sensitive areas.

In Japan, a demonstration project named Fukushima FORWARD (Fukushima Floating Offshore Wind Farm Demonstration Project) has been conducted since 2011. Fukushima FORWARD is carried out by the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry. The project is the world's first floating offshore windfarm with a total capacity of 14 MW, including three floating offshore wind facilities and one floating offshore substation. In Fukushima FORWARD, Japan Marine United Corporation is in charge of floater part EPCI (Engineering, Procurement, Construction and Installation) of one floating offshore wind facility and one floating offshore substation.This floating offshore substation is installed in order to observe meteorological and oceanographic data and motion data as well as boosting the generated electric power. Since the installation in 2013 it continues to record various kinds of continuous data. The substation is an advanced spar type floater moored by four spread catenary mooring lines.In the design of the mooring system for offshore structure, the motion of the structure under environmental external force is very important. The motion of the moored floating structure is divided into wave frequency motion, which is a motion of a relatively short period, and low frequency motion caused by mooring restoring force and variable external force, both of which are important elements in the design. Among them, wave frequency motion is known to be accurately estimated by potential theory as a result of research on various types of structures. On the other hand, in addition to the existence of various calculation methods including time domain analysis, its statistical characteristic and applicability are entirely depending on the target structure. Also, observation data of low frequency motion have been very few.In this paper, long-term data observed at the floating offshore substation in Fukushima FORWARD was analyzed with focusing on low frequency motion and its statistical properties were clarified. Furthermore, we analyzed the low frequency wave force spectrum and motion by conventional low frequency motion theory using the wave drifting force calculated by the potential theory.

The Doushantuo Formation in the paleouplift region was overlayed with thin thickness, including shore facies, mixed continental shelf facies and atypical carbonate platform facies. The marginal sag had complete strata and large thickness, and developed deep water shelf facies and restricted basin facies. (2) The Doushantuo Formation is divided into four members from bottom to top, and the sedimentary sequence is a complete sedimentary cycle of transgression-high position-regression. The first member is atypical carbonate gentle slope deposit in the early stage of the transgression, the second member is shore-mixed shelf deposit in the extensive transgression period, and the third member is atypical restricted-open sea platform deposit of the high position of the transgression. (3) The second member has organic-rich black shale developed with stable distribution and large thickness, which is an important source rock interval and major shale gas interval. The third member is characterized by microbial carbonate rock and has good storage conditions which is conducive to the accumulation of natural gas, phosphate and other mineral resources, so it is a new area worthy of attention.

In seabirds, poor knowledge of their true distribution outside the breeding season, however, has severely limited such studies. This study explored how annual adult survival rates of black-legged kittiwakes Rissa tridactyla on Hornoya in the southern Barents Sea were related to temporal variation in prey densities and climatic parameters in their breeding and non-breeding areas. We used information on the kittiwakes' spatiotemporal distribution in the non-breeding season gained from year-round light-based tracking devices (geolocators) and satellite transmitters, and kittiwake annual adult survival rates gained from a multistate capture-mark-recapture analysis of a 22 yr time series of colour-ringed kittiwakes. In the post-breeding period, kittiwakes concentrated in an area east of Svalbard, in the winter they stayed in the Grand Banks/Labrador Sea area, and in the pre-breeding period they returned to the Barents Sea. We identified 2 possible prey categories of importance for the survival of kittiwakes in these areas (sea butterflies Thecosomata in the Grand Banks/Labrador Sea area in winter and capelin Mallotus villosus in the Barents Sea in the pre-breeding season) that together explained 52% of the variation in adult survival rates.

However, interspecific relationships between temperature and size in zooplankton communities have not been fully examined in terms of temporal variation. To re-examine the relationship on a temporal scale and the effects of climate control thereon, we investigated the variation in copepod size structure in the eastern and western subarctic North Pacific in 2000-2011. This report presents the first basin-scale comparison of zooplankton community changes in the North Pacific based on a fully standardized data set obtained from the Continuous Plankton Recorder (CPR) survey. We found an increase in copepod community size (CCS) after 2006-2007 in the both regions because of the increased dominance of large cold-water species. Sea surface temperature varied in an east-west dipole manner, showing the typical Pacific Decadal Oscillation pattern: cooling in the east and warming in the west after 2006-2007. The observed positive correlation between CCS and sea surface temperature in the western North Pacific was inconsistent with the conventional interspecific temperature-size relationship. We explained this discrepancy by the geographical shift of the upper boundary of the thermal niche, the 9 degrees C isotherm, of large cold-water species. In the eastern North Pacific, the boundary stretched northeast, to cover a large part of the sampling area after 2006-2007. In contrast, in the western North Pacific, the isotherm location hardly changed and the sampling area remained within its thermal niche throughout the study period, despite the warming that occurred.

J,,,,,,,,,Thomas Wilding,,Optimising decommissioning of oil and gas pipelines with respect to the commercial fishing sector on the UK continental shelf.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Awarded Grant,Mar 31 2016,2016,"The oil and gas (O&G) and commercial-fishing sectors are among the two largest stakeholders that use the UK continental shelf (UKCS), particularly the North Sea. Evidence suggests that fishermen currently target pipelines, a poorly understood activity which has multi-sector implications for decommissioning. The challenge, as identified by the partners, is: the regulator and their advisers need to understand commercial fishing practices around pipelines in order to predict the consequences of various pipeline decommissioning options to both the O&G and fishing sectors. Such an understanding will enable the identification of the most cost-effective, legislatively compliant, safe and environmentally sustainable pipeline decommissioning option. This approach will reduce costs to all stakeholders and, ultimately, the UK taxpayer. To enable exploitation of UK Continental Shelf (UKCS) oil and gas (O&G), more than 45,000 km of pipelines have been installed since the 1960s [1]. Only 2% have been decommissioned and there has been little research on the consequences of decommissioning to other industries and the environment. Many of the pipelines are reaching the end of their useful lives and need decommissioning. Unlike platforms, pipelines are not covered by the OSPAR 98/3 ban on the disposal of installations at sea [2]. Pipeline decommissioning is considered on a case-by-case basis, by comparative assessment of the options. Operators must show that any proposed strategy meets international obligations to ensure the safety of navigation and fishing, and protection of the marine environment [1]. In the UKCS, fishing is an ecologically and economically important activity[3]. Due to the overlap of the O&G and fishing industries there is inevitably physical interaction between the two, including damage to fishing gear from pipelines [4] and to pipelines from fishing gear [5]. Vessels are banned from fishing within the 500 m exclusion zone around platforms [6], but no such restrictions apply to pipelines. Anecdotal accounts of vessels targeting pipelines as fishing grounds have always existed, with vessels thought to potentially benefit by targeting fish attracted to pipelines [7,8]. In 2014, analyses jointly undertaken by SAMS and MSS quantified the extent of this interaction and found that over a third of North Sea (NS) demersal trips fish occurred within 200 m of a pipe. The choice of decommissioning strategy of the ~2500 oil and gas pipelines will therefore have implications for the fishing industry and the environment.The proposed project brings together the regulator (Department of Environment and Climate Change), their advisers (Marine Scotland Science) and representatives of the fishing and O&G sectors (Scottish Fishermen's Federation and Oil and Gas UK respectively) to extend the 2014 analysis(see above) and translate it into predictions of the impact of a range of realistic decommissioning scenarios (e.g. 0 - 100 % pipeline removal, covering pipelines with rocks, pipeline-size dependent removal etc) on the fishing industry. The first stage will be to collate data on pipeline attributes (size, protective material, date of installation) and fishing behaviour around pipelines and identify 'hotspots' of pipeline/fishing interactions by quantifying and characterising the location where pipelines are frequently crossed as fishermen move between grounds. The impact of realistic decommissioning options will then be determined. The final stage of the project is to embed this new knowledge into the relevant stakeholder community (e.g. regulators, their advisers and industry). This will be achieved via knowledge-brokering events (e.g. multi-sector workshops), via industry-publications and, directly, via the project partners themselves.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,NE/N019369/1,,,,,,,,Scottish Association For Marine Science,Scottish Association For Marine Science,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:15344289,,

Diminishing levels of sea-ice has increased opportunities for maritime activities in historically inaccessible areas such as the Northern Sea Route and Northwest Passage. Degradation of Arctic marine ecosystems may accompany expanding vessel operations through introduced underwater noise, potential for large oil spills, among other things; and may compound stressors already effecting biological populations due to climate change. Assessments are needed to track changes in vessel traffic patterns and associated environmental impacts. We analyzed Arctic-wide vessel Automatic Identification System data 1 January 2015 to 31 December 2017 to quantify the amount and spatial distribution of vessel operations, assess possible changes in these operations, and establish a baseline for future monitoring. Nearly 400,000 vessel transits were analyzed. Number of trips, hours of operation, and amount of sea surface exposed to vessel traffic were used to compare operations between 14 delineated waterways. Operations were extensive and diverse: an average of 132,828 trips were made annually by over 5,000 different vessels. Transits were made in all areas studied and all months of the year. Maritime activities were intensive in some areas, but ice-limited in others. Amount of sea surface exposed to vessel traffic exceeded 70% in all but three areas. Bulk carriers, cargo ships, passenger/cruise ships, research survey ships, and vessels supporting oil/gas-related activities were represented. However, fishing vessels, primarily in the Barents, Bering, and Norwegian Seas, surpassed operations of all other vessel types and comprised about one-half of all voyages each year. We observed no overt increasing or decreasing trends in vessel traffic volume in our limited study period. Instead, inter-year variation was evident. While the number of unique vessels and transits increased year-to-year, hours of operation declined in the same period. Abundance/distribution of fisheries resources, economic feasibility of Arctic marine travel as weighed against inherent risks, and other factors likely accounted for inter-year variation in regional activity levels. Measures have been established to protect Arctic marine ecosystems but may need strengthening to address potential ecosystem threats from existing and growing commercial and industrial activities in the region.",,,,,,,,,36,0,3,0,16,0,41,,,,2296-7745,,,,,,,,,,"Smultea Environm Sci, Washington Grove 98050, MD USANOAA, Off Protected Resources, Natl Marine Fisheries Serv, Silver Spring, MD USA",Smultea Environm Sci,,,2019-09-18,WOS:000486546700002,,

One method for harvesting animal protein is to grow marine fish. This is widely practiced in coastal environments, but also leads to environmental problems associated with habitat loss and nutrient loading. One alternative is to move marine aquaculture further offshore, away from coastal land-use conflicts and towards ocean currents, which can efficiently dispose wastes. This concept creates a logistical challenge, however, since operators have to transport large amounts of food, fish and fuel to and from offshore cages on a regular basis and in varied weather conditions. In this paper, we discuss the economic feasibility of using offshore oil and gas platforms as bases for open ocean aquaculture in the Gulf of Mexico. We develop net-present value models of a platform-based operation and describe sensitivity analysis of the model output. We conclude that offshore platform-based mariculture may be commercially viable under favorable assumptions, that its viability requires economies of scale and depends principally on the yield per unit of cage volume achieved. The limitations of the analysis are described. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

J,,,,,,,,,"Todd, Robert","Gawarkiewicz, Glen; Andres, Magdalena",Collaborative Research: An Observational and Modeling Study of the Physical Processes Driving Exchanges between the Shelf and the Deep Ocean At Cape Hatteras,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Awarded Grant,Apr 01 2016,2016,"Recent unusual conditions along the U.S. East Coast have dramatically demonstrated the importance of understanding the dynamics controlling shelf-deep ocean exchange at the confluence of the North Atlantic gyres near Cape Hatteras. Atypical Gulf Stream position, air-sea heat flux, extremes in ocean temperature, and sea level rise are potential harbingers of larger shifts in atmospheric and oceanic forcing. Effects on shelf-deep ocean exchange are unknown due to incomplete dynamical understanding of the present. Development of predictive capacity is particularly relevant at this time, as oil and gas exploration is being planned. The understanding of shelf-deep ocean exchange gained through this project will be applicable to other regions where shelf and basin-scale currents converge and could improve our capacity to anticipate the response of the coastal ocean to climate change in the coming decades. In addition to the physical interactions between scales and oceanic regions, the relevance of exported shelf waters at Cape Hatteras to global carbon budgets may be large, and is difficult to quantify due to carbon budget mediation by biological ecosystems that vary with season and water mass. Both ecosystems and export processes may change under predicted climatic shifts, so understanding export processes has broad biogeochemical importance. Collaborations with biogeochemists and ecologists will be pursued to utilize the data to study ecosystems in this area of high biological diversity that is home to many commercially important species. Insights gained through the project will also improve mitigation of pollutant spills. The outreach and educational efforts include a public exhibit and talks, opportunities for joining science cruises and participation in the Society of Women Engineers Girls Engineer It! Day, a daylong event for girls in grades 6-12, and the Wood Hole Oceanographic Institution's summer program for undergraduates from underrepresented groups. The project will support two early career scientists, train one postdoctoral researcher and four graduate students, and give undergraduate students hands-on experience in the operation of the autonomous gliders. Subtropical and subpolar oceanic gyre boundaries are characterized by confluent western boundary currents and convergence in the adjacent shelf and slope waters. Together, they lead to large net export of shelf waters to the deep ocean, and complex, bidirectional shelf-deep ocean exchange, in response to strong forcing typical of mid-latitude western ocean margins. Shelf-deep ocean exchange processes at such dynamic sites remain poorly understood, due in part to the technical challenge of resolving broad ranges of relevant spatial and temporal scales. The understanding gained by investigating the wide seasonal range of parameter space will facilitate exploration of how shelf circulation and shelf-open ocean exchange may evolve due to observed and projected long-term shifts in regional and basin-scale circulation, hydrography, and atmospheric forcing. This project will deploy fixed, mobile, and remote observational platforms in combination with idealized and realistic numerical simulations to investigate exchange processes near Cape Hatteras. The sampling array will provide an observational data set with unprecedented temporal and spatial resolution in a region of large episodic export and exchange. These observations will be used to identify dominant exchange processes; correlate them with observed forcing; define ranges of forcing and shelf response; verify parallel developments within the realistic model framework; and establish causation through detailed assessment of momentum and vorticity balances, integrating observational and validated model products. In addition to physical data, the autonomous gliders will also collect chlorophyll fluorescence, oxygen saturation, and acoustic backscatter data that are of direct relevance to biogeochemical properties exported from the shelf to the deep ocean. These non-physical data will be used as water mass tracers and to portray the structure of the chlorophyll-a and dissolved oxygen at unprecedented resolution.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,1558521,,,,,,,,Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution,,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:13912727,,

Three piles were tested statically, with dynamic re-strike tests on paired piles, at 12-15 week ages. Instrumented dynamic driving and re-strike monitoring followed on up to 3.7 m dia. production piles. During driving, the shaft resistances developed at fixed depths below the seabed fell markedly during driving, with particularly sharp reductions occurring in the chalk. Shaft resistances increased markedly after driving and good agreement was seen between long-term capacities interpreted from parallel static and dynamic tests. Analyses employing the sites' geotechnical profiles show long-term shaft resistances in the chalk that far exceed those indicated by current design recommendations, while newly proposed procedures offer good predictions.

A significant decrease in greenhouse gases emissions cannot be achieved without carbon capture and sequestration (CCS) technologies.

This study proposes to assess and tackle this issue within the CCS design problem, by proposing a spatially explicit mixed integer linear programming approach for the economic optimisation of a European supply chain for carbon capture, transport and geological storage, where societal risk assessment is formally incorporated within the modelling framework. Post-combustion, oxy-fuel combustion and pre-combustion are considered as technological options for CO2 capture, whereas both pipelines (inshore and offshore) and ships are taken into account as transport means. Both inland-inshore and offshore injection options are available for carbon geological sequestration. Risk mitigation measures are considered in the design of the transport network. The overall supply chain is economically optimised for different minimum carbon reduction scenarios. Results demonstrate that accounting for societal risk may impact the overall carbon sequestration capacity, and that the proposed approach may represent a valuable tool to support policy makers in their strategic decisions.",,,,,,,,,37,1,0,0,2,0,38,,,0306-2619,1872-9118,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Padua, Dept Ind Engn, CAPE Lab, Via Marzolo 9, I-35131 Padua, PD, ItalyUniv Padua, Dept Ind Engn, Via Marzolo 9, I-35131 Padua, PD, Italy",,,,2018-12-28,WOS:000433649900028,,

Fish, one of the top predators in marine environments, should be an essential representative species used for water column toxicity testing in response to waterborne CO2 exposure. In the present study, we conducted fish life cycle toxicity tests to fully elucidate CO2 toxicity mechanism effects. We tested sub-lethal and lethal toxicities of elevated CO2 concentrations on marine medaka (Oryzias melastigma) at different developmental stages. At each developmental stage, the test species was exposed to varying concentrations of gaseous CO2 (control air, 5%, 10%, 20%, and 30%), with 96 h of exposure at 0-4 d (early stage), 4-8 d (middle stage), and 8-12 d (late stage). Sub-lethal and lethal effects, including early developmental delays, cardiac edema, tail abnormalities, abnormal pigmentation, and mortality were monitored daily during the 14 d exposure period. At the embryonic stage, significant sub-lethal and lethal effects were observed at pH < 6.30. Hypercapnia can cause long-term and/or delayed developmental embryonic problems, even after transfer back to clean seawater. At fish juvenile and adult stages, significant mortality was observed at pH < 5.70, indicating elevated CO2 exposure might cause various adverse effects, even during short-term exposure periods. It should be noted the early embryonic stage was found more sensitive to CO2 exposure than other developmental stages of the fish life cycle. Overall, the present study provided baseline information for potential adverse effects of high CO2 concentration exposure on fish developmental processes at different life cycle stages in marine ecosystems.

For such purposes, Lido di Dante (Ravenna, Italy) was selected, being a well-documented site that suffers from severe erosion.The design method proposed follows the Design Guidelines for low-crested structures delivered by DELOS. After a preliminary analysis of the environmental context and constraints, different design alternatives were proposed and then modelled with the 2DH model suite MIKE 21 for representative hydrodynamics and meteorological conditions. Engineering, ecological and social effects of each alternative are then assessed, based on the results of numerical simulations and experience in the area. A global judgement of the alternatives is given including consideration of both construction and maintenance costs. The preferred scheme is then optimised through more detailed design and verified by numerical modelling. The need for such an integrated approach is finally discussed including limitations.

The objective is to demonstrate the viability of a full CCS system, from CO2 capture to injection and storage. One hundred thousand tonnes/year or more of CO2 is being injected and stored in offshore saline aquifers in the Tomakomai port area. The implementation of this project has been commissioned to Japan CCS Co., Ltd. (JCCS) by the New Energy and Industrial Technology Development Organization (NEDO) with the subsidies for the operating expenses by the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI).The CO2 source is a pressure swing adsorption offgas from a hydrogen production unit (HPU) of an oil refinery located in the coastal area of Tomakomai Port. The HPU provides CO2 rich offgas to the Tomakomai demonstration project CO2 capture facility via a 1.4 km pipeline. In the capture facility, gaseous CO2 of 99% or higher purity is recovered from the offgas by a commercially proven amine scrubbing process with a design capacity of 200,000 tonnes per year.At the injection facility, the gaseous CO2 is compressed and injected into two different offshore reservoirs (Moebetsu Formation/sandstone layers and Takinoue Formation/volcanic rocks layers) by two dedicated deviated injection wells. The storage points are located at 3 to 4 km offshore.The project is scheduled to run between the period of JFY 2012 -2020 (JFY is from April of calendar year to following March). The injection of CO2 began in April 2016. The injection of CO2 will be conducted for three years and monitoring for five years. The injection target is 300,000 tonnes in total over three years.The main features of this project are: 1) Extensive monitoring system in seismically active country, 2) Deviated CO2 injection wells drilled from onshore to offshore, 3) Marine environmental survey by domestic law reflecting London Protocol, 4) Low energy CO2 capture process, 5) Injection of CO2 near urban area.

Various other microbial functional genes that are relevant to carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus, sulfur and iron cycling, metal resistance and bacteriophage replication were also enriched in the plume.

Proposed development sites are characterized by large tidal ranges, strong tidal flows, extreme turbulence, and in some cases sediment-laden water restricting visibility, imposing monitoring challenges. Turbulence-induced acoustic backscatter typically occurs in the top 10-20 m, but can extend from the surface to bottom during some phases of the tide. In Minas Passage, turbulence accounted for 78 % of the total water column backscatter making the separation of fish difficult if not impossible at times. In this paper, we examine operational capabilities of two high-frequency multibeam sonars to meet these monitoring challenges in the nearshore high-flow shallow coastal waters (1-100 m). Observations from proposed sites are used to illustrate the challenges as well as the advantages, and limitations, of multibeam sonars compared to conventional split beam technology in strong tidal currents and turbulent waters. Acoustic multibeam hardware necessary to meet the monitoring demands is currently available, but the processing and analytical software required to advance their application is insufficient to meet the requirements for effects and impact monitoring. It is anticipated that the required advancements will be available within the next 5 years.

In the 2010s, renewable energy generated from wind, wave and tide is laying claim to large areas of marine space and driving the search to find new ways to manage ocean and coastal development. Many more activities are expected and precedents are currently being set for the future of marine governance. Several observers have drawn parallels with the development of offshore oil and gas in the 1970s, which also represented a step change in use of the seas and coasts. The change was particularly felt in the Orkney and Shetland archipelagos, at the centre of the North Sea oilfields. Special powers were granted to the county councils here to control development and share in its benefits. This paper compares the oil and renewables industries, separated in time by nearly 40 years, and their influence on adjacent communities. The similarities and differences are identified to test the hypothesis that the 1970s oil model of local participation could be repeated for the development of marine renewables in the 2010s. The conclusion is that the model could well be applied but that the political and policy drivers of today make it unlikely, at least for the time being. Most notably, the change in the role of the public and private sectors and the use of market instruments to achieve national objectives tend to favour a climate of central control.

The basal high resistivity zone has a higher proportion of Type II sedimentary organic matter than the overlying TMS, indicating it is more prone to oil generation. Optical petrography and electron microscopy reveal a heterogeneous clay matrix with ubiquitous pyrite grains, quartz, feldspar, glaucony, foraminifera, shell fragments, and rarer occurrences of apatite and crinoid fragments as well as liptinite, alginite, inertinite, and vitrinite. Our petrographic observations suggest that higher abundances of detrital quartz grains coupled with minimal authigenic cements result in higher porosity and permeability. However, the TMS is also more clay-rich than other unconventional shale oil and gas plays, which can impair the effectiveness of hydraulic fracture stimulation. Thin section observations reveal alternating clay and calcium carbonate laminae that are interpreted to reflect changes in sediment flux. Planktonic foraminifera indicate an overlying oxygenated water column while benthic inoceramid fragments and pervasive authigenic pyrite suggest anoxic or dysoxic bottom water conditions. Apatite fragments in thin section suggest mixing events and an influx of nutrient-rich sediments. Overall, these observations suggest that a variety of paleodepositional environments occurred in the TMS and the lithofacies diversity resulting from these small-scale depositional cycles makes it difficult to determinatively identify areas conducive to enhanced economic hydrocarbon recovery.",,,,,,,,,10,0,0,0,0,0,12,,,0264-8172,1873-4073,,,,,,,,,,"US Geol Survey, Eastern Energy Resources Sci Ctr, 12201 Sunrise Valley Dr, Reston, VA 20192 USAUS Geol Survey, Reston, VA 20192 USA",,,,2020-09-29,WOS:000569064200004,,

Colonization of these created reefs by oysters and other select taxa was examined. Created reefs supported numerous oyster reef-associated faunas at equivalent or greater densities than adjacent natural reefs. Eastern oyster (Crassostrea virginica) settlement at one site of created reef exceeded that of the adjacent natural reefs within 9 mo of reef creation. After only 2 yr, harvestable-size C. virginica (>75 mm) were present in the created reefs along with substantial numbers of C. virginica clusters. The created reefs also had a higher number of molluscan, fish, and decapod species than the adjacent natural reefs. After 2 yr the densities of C. virginica, striped barnacle (Balanus amphitrite), scorched mussel (Brachidontes exustus), Atlantic ribbed mussel (Geukensia denissa), common mud c-rab (Panopeus herbstii), and Bat mud crab (Eurypanopeus depressus) within the created reefs were equivalent to that of adjacent natural reefs. From these data it is evident that created oyster reefs can quickly acquire functional ecological attributes of their natural counterparts. Because the demand far oysters continues to increase in the face of dwindling natural resources, habitat creation techniques need to evolve and these approaches need to consider the ancillary ecological benefits reef creation mw provide. Reef function as well as physical and ecological linkages of oyster reefs to other habitats (marsh, submerged aquatic vegetation, and bare bottom) should be considered when reefs are created in order to provide the best use of resources to maintain tbe integrity of estuarine systems.",,,,,,,,,94,2,0,0,78,2,126,,,0160-8347,,,,,,,,,,,"NOAA, Ctr Coastal Fisheries & Habitat Res, Beaufort Lab, Beaufort, NC 28516 USA",,,,2000-02-01,WOS:000086459100004,,

This study reviews the effect of ocean acidification (OA) on seagrasses, assessing how this may affect their capacity to sequester carbon in the future and providing an economic valuation of these changes. If ocean acidification leads to a significant increase in above- and below-ground biomass, the capacity of seagrass to sequester carbon will be significantly increased. The associated value of this increase in sequestration capacity is approximately 500 and 600 billion globally between 2010 and 2100. A proportionally similar increase in carbon sequestration value was found for the UK.

Yet with limited funds for conservation of threatened species and ecosystems there is a desire to identify priority areas where investment efficiently conserves multiple ecosystem services. We mapped four mangrove ecosystems services (coastal protection, fisheries, biodiversity, and carbon storage) across Fiji. Using a cost-effectiveness analysis, we prioritised mangrove areas for each service, where the effectiveness was a function of the benefits provided to the local communities, and the costs were associated with restricting specific uses of mangroves. We demonstrate that, although priority mangrove areas (top 20%) for each service can be managed at relatively low opportunity costs (ranging from 4.5 to 11.3% of overall opportunity costs), prioritising for a single service yields relatively low co-benefits due to limited geographical overlap with priority areas for other services. None-the-less, prioritisation of mangrove areas provides greater overlap of benefits than if sites were selected randomly for most ecosystem services. We discuss deficiencies in the mapping of ecosystems services in data poor regions and how this may impact upon the equity of managing mangroves for particular services across the urban-rural divide in developing countries. Finally we discuss how our maps may aid decision-makers to direct funding for mangrove management from various sources to localities that best meet funding objectives, as well as how this knowledge can aid in creating a national mangrove zoning scheme.

The major oil- and gas-producing companies' search and rescue (SAR) service is responsible for medical evacuations. Using a prospective approach, we describe the characteristics of patients evacuated by SAR.DESIGN AND SETTING: A prospective observational study of the offshore primary care provided by SAR in the North Sea.METHODS: Patients were identified by linking flight information from air transport services in 2015/2016 and the company's medical record system. Standardised forms filled out by SAR nurses during the evacuation were also analysed. In-hospital information was obtained retrospectively from Haukeland University Hospital's information system.RESULTS: A total of 381 persons (88% men) were evacuated during the study period. Twenty-seven per cent of missions were due to chest pain and 18% due to trauma. The mean age was 46.0 years. Severity scores were higher for cases due to medical conditions compared with trauma, but the scores were relatively low compared with onshore emergency missions. The busiest months were May, July and December. Weekends were the busiest days.CONCLUSION: Three times as many evacuations from offshore installations are performed due to acute illness than trauma, and cardiac problems are the most common. Although most patients are not severely physiologically deranged, the study documents a need for competent SAR services 24hours a day year-round.

Marine propulsion systems represent a dominant load on most vessels and dynamically positioned (DP) offshore installations. These propulsion systems are typically nonlinear in nature with very high harmonic injection, which can have a significant impact on vessel wide systems and subsystems. AC adjustable speed drive (ASD) propulsion systems characteristically inject current harmonics into the generator system impedance creating voltage distortion. DC ASDs produce even higher voltage distortion levels due to voltage notching caused by the thyristor firing which makes their harmonic mitigation requirement much more challenging. In order to eliminate the numerous harmonic problems, the dc propulsion system of the oil service vessel was retrofitted with harmonic mitigation equipment. The case study discusses: 1) operational issues including component failures in crane controls and ROV equipment while operating in DP mode; 2) field testing to document the harmonic distortion conditions created by the propulsion and thruster dc ASDs prior to treatment; 3) computer simulation of the dc drive propulsion system to determine a harmonic mitigation strategy; and 4) extensive sea trial testing of the power system with harmonic mitigation to demonstrate compliance with ABS harmonic limits, compatibility of the harmonic mitigation with the ASD equipment, and resolution of all connected equipment failures and operational problems.",,,,,,,,,2,0,0,0,0,0,2,,,0093-9994,1939-9367,,,,,,,,,,"Mirus Int Inc, Brampton, ON L6S 5P6, CanadaNSOEM, Waller, TX 77484 USA",Mirus Int IncNSOEM,,,2017-04-26,WOS:000398745400086,,

Despite a complex effort to cap the well, oil and gas spewed from the site until July 15, 2010. Although a large proportion of the hydrocarbons was depleted via natural processes and human intervention, a substantial portion of the oil remained unaccounted for and impacted multiple ecosystems throughout the Gulf of Mexico. The depth, duration and magnitude of this spill were unique, raising many questions and concerns regarding the fate of the hydrocarbons released. One major question was whether or not microbial communities would be capable of metabolizing the hydrocarbons, and if so, by what mechanisms and to what extent? In this review, we summarize the microbial response to the oil spill as described by studies performed during the past four years, providing an overview of the different responses associated with the water column, surface waters, deep-sea sediments, and coastal sands/sediments. Collectively, these studies provide evidence that the microbial response to the Deepwater Horizon oil spill was rapid and robust, displaying common attenuation mechanisms optimized for low molecular weight aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbons. In contrast, the lack of evidence for the attenuation of more recalcitrant hydrocarbon components suggests that future work should focus on both the environmental impact and metabolic fate of recalcitrant compounds, such as oxygenated oil components.",,,,,,,,,110,0,0,0,88,0,122,,,1664-302X,,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Miguel Hernandez, Div Microbiol, Evolutionary Genom Grp, San Juan, SpainUniv Oklahoma, Dept Microbiol & Plant Biol, Norman, OK 73019 USAUniv S Carolina, Belle W Baruch Inst Marine & Coastal Sci, Georgetown, SC USA",,,,2014-12-31,WOS:000345747300001,25477866,

Seventeen collection stations were established and monitored at New Bayou, Texas, a small gradient estuary which receives petroleum products via oil/gas field produced water discharge. Hydrographic, geologic and biotic samples were taken monthly from each station during a period of reduced rainfall.Both temperature and dissolved oxygen data taken during the study followed patterns typical for the area. Salinity values increased into the polyhaline range at near-bay stations during the reduced rain period, while upper bayou stations remained within the oligohaline range.Sediment grain sizes along the bayou were generally in the silty-clay range. Sediment hydrocarbon concentrations were highest (11.4 mg g-1 dry sediment) around the produced water discharge site and lowest at near-bay stations (0.2 mg g-1 dry sediment). Ninety-six macrobenthic species were collected during the study. General effects from produced water discharge on macrobenthic populations followed the classical pattern outlined by other research in shallow bay systems. A sediment hydrocarbon concentration of 2.5 mg g-1 dry sediment was found to reflect the average value needed to depress population abundances. Both abundance and diversity values were lowest at central stations near the discharge site.

J,,,,,,,,,"Anisimov,Nikita",,The Technology of Monitoring and Rational Use of Marine Biological Resources,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Awarded Grant,Jan 01 1800,2014,"In recent years, the seas of the Far East have gained a special position in the Russian economy. This is mainly due to the discovery of large reserves of oil and gas in the Far East shelf, with development and reconstruction of ports, building of industrial, commercial and fish processing enterprises in the coastal zone, gas and oil pipelining on the bottom and the sea coast. At the same time, the Russian Far East seas are important fishing areas for various fish species, marine invertebrates and algae. The region produces more than two thirds of marine biological resources in Russia. In many parts of the area, the coastal fishing industry, including aquaculture becomes very important and often the main component of the economics ensuring the economic and social development of the coastal areas and islands. Along with the observed increase in industrial and economic activity in the use of mineral and biological potential of the Far Eastern seas of Russia, there occur nowadays numerous dramatic changes in marine ecosystems. These changes recorded in Russian territorial waters and within the exclusive economic zone of the seas and oceans and associated either with natural fluctuations or with anthropogenic impacts increase the risk of environmental disasters with incalculable economic and social consequences. Noteworthy, the presently existing problems of ecological safety of the Russian waters can in the coming years significantly increase. Presently, the state policy of the Russian Federation is aimed at creating conditions for accelerated social and economic development of the Russian Far East with involvement of a number of large-scale projects, including shipbuilding, production and transportation of petroleum hydrocarbons, fish processing, reproduction of biological resources, and perfection of tourism infrastructure. We propose a program addressing the following important strategic issues in the Far Eastern region: 1) rational use of biological resources and sustainable social and economic development of the Far East of Russia in the context of exploitation of abundant natural resources of the Far Eastern seas, creating a safe and comfortable living conditions for the population, including food security and biological security of products of marine origin, creation of new jobs, an increase in population of the Far East, the region's attractiveness for investment, and enhancement of the role of Russia in the economic and political life of the Asia-Pacific region; 2) conservation and effective monitoring of the production potential and biodiversity of the marine areas under real climatic changes, active industrial and economic activities in coastal areas and offshore, and anthropogenic pollution of coastal waters. The proposed Research Program presents a complex system of measures, based on fundamental knowledge of the current status and functioning of marine ecosystems, the latest technologies and technical means available to provide high-performance monitoring of marine ecosystems and to prevent crisis changes in the waters of the Far Eastern seas of Russia, associated with severe climatic fluctuations and high anthropogenic impacts: intensive fishing of biological resources, large-scale poaching, industrial and economic activities in the coastal areas and offshore, exploration, production and transportation of hydrocarbons, the increasing traffic of maritime transport, and transboundary pollution from river runoff. Actuality of the program is due to the fact that the current methods and technologies for monitoring marine ecosystems have little effect, since they are mainly focused on fixing the events that have already occurred and the facts that cause indigenous and already irreversible restructuring of the ecosystem components, unpredictable events (e.g. eutrophication, red tides, etc.) and environmental disasters. The incoming information on the primary production in the water areas is sporadic, and the methods used are not able to capture and identify the initial changes in the lower levels of the trophic chain, determining the structure of biological communities and functional characteristics of ecosystems. The major disadvantage of the currently used methods is that they are not able to provide a continuous flow of information, including the real-time information on the mechanisms of functioning of the ecosystem and its main biological components, namely the phytoplankton, on the first signs of disorders in the impaired biological systems, and on the space-temporal dynamics of the ecosystem crisis development. So, the present approach cannot not effectively predict ecosystem disturbances caused by climate changes and an increased anthropogenic impact; this does not allow to assess the stability of the populations of some commercial species and to reliably predict their condition. Even the currently used methods and equipment for satellite monitoring of the primary production of the ocean and the monitoring of microalgae, if they are not properly calibrated by other precision instrumental methods in particular circumstances, give invalid data and can be only relatively effective in complex measurements of these indicators with the use of other surface and underwater technologies. With the increased dynamics of natural and anthropogenic factors affecting the biological productivity of marine ecosystems, the traditional hydrobiological methods (dredges, bottom trawls, bottom grabs) are no longer able to fully ensure the accuracy of the accounts, estimation of trends, forecast accuracy and calculation of economic risks to marine biological resources and biodiversity. The scientific novelty of the program opens an opportunity to solve the above problems and to handle the challenges on a new quality level with the use of the latest techniques and technologies, including, among others, the use of surface and submarine robotics, lidar and acoustic means of control of the aquatic environment and the accounting and monitoring of marine biological resources; new molecular biological, biochemical and genetic methods for control the physiological state of the commercial aquatic species and for assessment of the sustainability of their populations; new approaches and methods for reproduction of marine biological resources under the conditions of marine biotechnological parks and the technologies of waste-free processing of marine biological raw materials and production of new types of functional foods; technology for production of biologically active compounds from marine organisms and their synthesis aimed at creation of new drugs. The program is characterized by an integrated approach to achieving the designated target; this approach involves implementation of several of major closely interrelated areas (projects), covering the full range of necessary measures and actions to resolve the issues. The program includes five main directions; each of them is presented as a major independent project, structured in turn into thematic sections, headed by leading scientists in the field of research: 6. Modern technologies and technical means for control of the state of marine ecosystems and marine biological resources (Academician Yu. N. Kul'chin). 7. Modern technologies for control of various types of anthropogenic pollution of the aquatic environment and for assessment of their impact on the marine biological resources (Corr. Member of RAS V.A. Avramenko) 8. Modern technologies for accounting of marine resources and monitoring of natural populations of valuable commercial aquatic species (Academician A.V. Adrianov). 9. Modern technologies for reproduction and waste-free processing of marine biological resources (Professor I.Yu. Dolmatov). 10. The development of innovative medicines and functional foods (Professor Y. S. Khotimchenko). The sequence of these directions is determined by the fact that each of them is a prerequisite for the successful implementation of each subsequent direction, so the successful implementation of the entire program is ensured. Thus, the first research direction involves the design and construction of prototypes of robotic, lidar and acoustic hardware systems and the development of technologies of their application to control of the aquatic environment (including real-time monitoring), which is a prerequisite for the implementation of the second direction, including technologies for identification and control of various types of water pollution and biological objects. The proposed hardware systems are the essential carriers of technical equipment for hydrological and hydrochemical monitoring of marine ecosystems and the analysis of sediments, to assess the quality of habitats of commercially valuable species. In the current conditions of the dynamics of marine ecosystems, the satellite observation algorithms (corrected in terms of regional peculiarities) and underwater robotic tools are necessary for a reliable assessment of the production potential and the accounting of marine living resources in the vast water areas of the Far Eastern seas; while mobile hardware systems and technologies of rapid diagnosis of pollution are essential for the control of underwater plantations in marine biotechnology parks. The most efficient mechanism to reduce a negative impact on natural populations of commercially valuable species is their reproduction in the natural environment (plantations) in a marine biotech park, which makes it also possible to implement the technologies of waste-free processing. In turn, such bio-technoparks may become a source of raw materials not only for the food industry, but also a source for elaboration of new types of drugs. In general, successful implementation of these projects under a single program will not only create a unique technological platform in the Far East of Russia and form the basis for complex solving of applied problems of environmental management at the advanced technical level, but will also bring the Far Eastern Federal University to the leading position in research of the World Ocean and in creation of new technologies for its development; this advance will fully corresponds to the first priority area in the development of the Far Eastern Federal University (FEFU) - The World Ocean, approved by the Government of the Russian Federation. With its implementation, the program will focus not only on the material-technical and intellectual resources of the Far Eastern Federal University, but also on the abilities of a number of specialized research institutes of the Federal Agency of Scientific Organizations and the Far Eastern Branch of the RAS operating in the region and closely integrated with the Far Eastern Federal University. The joint implementation of all scientific directions of this program will not only solve the essential applied problems in creation of new technologies, but also will positively lead to an increase in the quality and quantity of scientific publications of the FEFU in the field of World Ocean research. Implementation of the program will also create new and unique opportunities for improvement and technical support of the educational process in a variety of disciplines and areas of training related to the study of the ocean. The proposed program will also contribute to the development of interactions between individual schools of the FEFU, as the implementation of these projects will involve not only the resources of the School of Natural Sciences, unifying the departments of mathematical, physical, chemical, biological directions and Earth sciences, but also the School of Biomedicine and the Engineering School of the FEFU.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,14-50-00034,,,,,,,,Far Eastern Federal University,,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:15292296,,

Thus, the concept of artificial reef units has evolved which has been gaining importance owing to the flexibility in molding to any desired shapes and sizes, workability and also due to the fact that it creates a habitable environment to marine flora and fauna. From the hydrodynamic performance perspective, artificial reef units are proven to be more efficient in reducing wave transmission on the lee side (e.g., Southern Caribbean shore of Dominican Republic and Vaan Island, Tuticorin, India). A comprehensive experimental investigation to examine the effect of trench width on hydrodynamic characteristics of the submerged reef system was carried out. The trench width was varied by incorporating single, double, and multiple perforated submerged trapezoidal artificial reef units. The focus of the present study is mainly on the influence of the number of reef units, relative crest width, and relative trench width of the submerged reef system on its transmission and reflection characteristics. The relative trench width was found to be an influential factor on wave transmission past the structure, and the least wave transmission was achieved for the reef configuration with eight units.

Tracks from 90 post-nesting turtles (65 in the Gulf and 25 from Oman) revealed that hawksbills in the Arabian region may nest up to 6 times in a season with an average of 3 nests per turtle. Turtles from Qatar, Iran and the UAE generally migrated south and southwest to waters shared by the UAE and Qatar. A smaller number of turtles migrated northward towards Bahrain, Saudi Arabia and one reached Kuwait. Omani turtles migrated south towards Masirah island and to Quwayrah, staying close to the mainland and over the continental shelf. The widespread dispersal of hawksbill foraging grounds across the SW Gulf may limit habitat protection options available to managers, and we suggest these be linked to preservation of shallow water habitats and fishery management. In contrast, the two main foraging areas in Oman were small and could be candidates for protected area consideration. Critical migration bottlenecks were identified at the easternmost point of the Arabian Peninsula as turtles from Daymaniyat Islands migrate southward, and between Qatar and Bahrain. Overall, Gulf turtles spent 68% of the time in foraging ground with home ranges of 40-60 km(2) and small core areas of 6 km2. Adult female turtles from Oman were significantly larger than Gulf turtles by similar to 11 cm ((x) over bar = 81.4 CCL) and spent 83% of their time foraging in smaller home ranges with even smaller core areas (similar to 3 km(2)), likely due to better habitat quality and food availability. Gulf turtles were among the smallest in the world ((x) over bar = 70.3 CCL) and spent an average of 20% of time undertaking summer migration loops, a thermoregulatory response to avoid elevated sea surface temperatures, as the Gulf regularly experiences sustained sea surface temperatures >30 degrees C. Fishery bycatch was determined for two of the 90 turtles. These spatio-temporal findings on habitat use will enable risk assessments for turtles in the face of multiple threats including oil and gas industries, urban and industrial development, fishery pressure, and shipping. They also improve our overall understanding of hawksbill habitat use and behaviour in the Arabian region, and will support sea turtle conservation-related policy decision-making at national and regional levels.

Adsorbed SD25 increased the distribution coefficients of both polyaromatic hydrocarbons in sand but not silty loam and the solubilising effect of SD25 appeared to drive increased adsorption of PHE rather than sediment-adsorbed SD25 concentration.ConclusionsThe findings highlight the influence of SD25 application on the sorption dynamics of NAP and PHE in marine sediments from areas near hydrocarbon exploration and production regions. An understanding of these interactions may aid responders in the decision-making process of dispersant application in the event of a spill as seabed characteristics affect oil-dispersant-sediment interactions.",,,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,,,1439-0108,1614-7480,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Aberdeen, Inst Biol & Environm Sci, Aberdeen, ScotlandUniv Aberdeen, Surface Chem & Catalysis Grp, Mat & Chem Engn, Dept Engn, Aberdeen, ScotlandMarine Lab Aberdeen, Marine Scotland Sci, Aberdeen, Scotland",,,,2019-03-12,WOS:000459805400047,,

Events like the recent BP's oil disaster in the Gulf of Mexico would have a tremendous impact on a close basin like the Mediterranean Sea. The recently EU-funded project ULIXES (http://www.ulixes.unimi.it) aims to unravel, categorize, catalogue, exploit and manage the microbial diversity available in the Mediterranean Sea for addressing bioremediation of polluted marine sites. The rationale of the project is based on the multiple diverse environmental niches of the Mediterranean Sea and the huge range of microorganisms inhabiting therein. Microbial consortia and their ecology, their components or products are used for designing novel pollutant- and site-tailored bioremediation approaches. ULIXES exploits microbial resource mining by the isolation of novel microorganisms as well as by novel advanced 'meta-omics' technologies for solving pollution of three major high priority pollutant classes, petroleum hydrocarbons, chlorinated compounds and heavy metals. A network of twelve European and Southern Mediterranean partners is exploring the microbial diversity and ecology associated to a large set of polluted environmental matrices including seashore sands, lagoons, harbors and deep-sea sediments, oil tanker shipwreck sites, as well as coastal and deep sea natural sites where hydrocarbon seepages occur.

The Deepwater Horizon (DWH) oil spill in April 2010 in the northern GoM resulted in large amounts of oil and dispersant released to the water column, which potentially modified Hg bioaccumulation patterns in affected areas. We measured Hg species (methylmercury (MMHg) and inorganic Hg (IHg)) concentrations, and light (C, N and S) and Hg stable isotopes in muscle and liver tissues from tilefish (Lopholatilus chamaleonticeps) sampled in 2012 and 2013 along the shelf break of the northeastern GoM. Fish located close to the mouth of the Mississippi River (MR) and northwest of the DWH well-head (47 km) showed significantly lower Hg levels in muscle and liver than fish located further northeast of the DWH (>109 km), where 98% of tilefish had Hg levels in the muscle above US consumption advisory thresholds (50% for tilefish close to the DWH). Differences in light and Hg stable isotopes signatures were observed between these two areas, showing higher delta N-15, and lower delta Hg-202, Delta Hg-199 and delta S-34 in fish close to the DWH/MR. This suggests that suspended particles from the MR reduces Hg bioavailability at the base of the GoM food chains. This phenomenon can be locally enhanced by the DWH that resulted in increased particles in the water column as evidenced by the marine snow layer in the sediments. On the other hand, freshly deposited Hg associated with organic matter in more oligotrophic marine waters enhanced Hg bioaccumulation in local food webs. Comparing Hg isotopic composition in liver and muscle of fish indicates specific metabolic response in fish having accumulated high levels of MMHg.

CCS will require vast CO2 storage capacity. At present only geological storage is being considered. This paper revisits an alternative CO2 storage possibility in enclosed basins on the deep and very deep ocean floor.For example, the Indonesian Sunda trench, the Japanese Ryukyu trench and the Puerto Rico trench are more than 6 km deep. If liquid CO2 were to be placed in such a trench, it would be 7% more dense than seawater and could remain permanently as a lake of liquid CO2 on the ocean floor, possibly becoming a solid hydrate over time which could inhibit mixing between the stored CO2 and ocean currents.At depths greater than about 4 to 5 km metres, seawater is under-saturated in calcium carbonate, so ocean ecosystems are significantly different. Any impact on deep marine fauna would need to be investigated.The London Dumping Convention has provisions for disposal of material into the ocean provided the absence of adverse effects can be proven.Deep ocean CO2 entrapment is more certain than geological CO2 storage in deep aquifers. A CO2 delivery concept by ship and vertical pipe is suggested for exploratory trials, with subsea pipelines for permanent installations, which might be much cheaper than geological CO2 storage.There is vast capacity for storage of CO2 in the world's very deep ocean trenches. The Sunda trench below 6 km has the capacity to accommodate 19,000 gigatonnes of liquid CO2, which is greater than the CO2 yield from all currently known global fossil fuel reserves. The Puerto Rico trench has capacity for 24,000 Gt of liquid CO2 deeper than 7 km. Enclosed basins of limited area could easily accommodate captured CO2.China has the largest potential demand for CO2 storage from power generation and industrial sources, which could be 3 Gt per year by 2050. The Ryukyu trench, which is 700 km from the Chinese coast and is in Japanese water, has two sections deeper than 7 km. Those sections of the Ryukyu trench would have the capacity to accommodate all the CO2 captured in China at 3 Gt per year for over 200 years.In the event that very deep ocean storage of CO2 is found to be practicable and acceptable, the minimum practical depth would need to be determined as a criterions for acceptable additional storage locations. For consideration, there is an enclosed basin on the floor of the Mediterranean Sea 60 km off Southern Greece, with capacity for 84 Gt of CO2 deeper than 4.5 km. Also, there is an enclosed basin in the Arabian Sea, 320 km south west of Karachi, with capacity for 86 Gt of CO2 deeper than 3.5 km. The potential storage of CO2 in such locations would be temperature dependent.The global CCS community has previously considered ocean storage of CO2 on the basis of ultimate dissolution and dispersion of CO2 in ocean water. Those studies have dismissed ocean storage as environmentally unacceptable due to ocean acidification.This paper postulates that very deep ocean trenches (>6 km) and deep ocean floor depressions (>4 km) are environments for CO2 storage, where permanent storage without dissolution, acidification or adverse effects on fauna may be possible.The purpose of this paper is to pose the question Why not? to the CCS community and to suggest that active research is timely.

Oil spill simulations for 19 existing offshore wells were carried out based on novel and high resolution bathymetric, meteorological, oceanographic, and geomorphological data. The simulations show a trend for east and northeast movement of oil spills into the Levantine Basin, affecting the coastal areas of Israel, Lebanon and Syria. Oil slicks will reach the coast in 1 to 20 days, driven by the action of the winds, currents and waves. By applying a qualitative analysis, seabed morphology is for the first time related to the direction of the oil slick expansion, as it is able to alter the movement of sea currents. Specifically, the direction of the major axis of the oil spills, in most of the cases examined, is oriented according to the prevailing azimuth of bathymetric features. This work suggests that oil spills in the Eastern Mediterranean Sea should be mitigated in the very few hours after their onset, and before wind and currents disperse them.

An industry spill response plan states that operators would collect systematic observations on spills and deploy countermeasures where possible. Operators' spill reports were obtained under an Access to Information request. There were 220 daytime spills with sheens (out of 381 spills; 1997-2010).

In Australia, its effects on ecosystem services have not been fully quantified. We examined the extent to which grazing by livestock influenced supporting (productivity, habitat for organisms and biodiversity) and regulating (carbon cycling and hydrological function) services, using data from published and unpublished studies on livestock grazing from a large number of sites across Australia. Grazing reduced our measure of supporting services by about 20% and regulatory services by 8%. On average, grazing reduced plant productivity by 40%, habitat value by 20%, and biodiversity, hydrological function and carbon sequestration by about 10%. Habitat and productivity showed strong declines with increasing grazing intensity, and carbon showed strong declines at the lowest and highest contrasts. Hydrological function and biodiversity did not decline with increasing grazing intensity. Overall, the results indicate that livestock grazing leads to substantial degradation at a continental scale by reducing ecosystem services associated with habitat provision, biodiversity, and soil and water functions. Management of livestock grazing will be critical if we are to retain functional levels of ecosystem services into the next century.

Seagrass meadows are important global blue carbon sinks. Despite a 30% loss of seagrasses globally during the last century, there is limited empirical research investigating the effects of disturbance and loss of seagrass on blue carbon stocks. 2. In this study, we hypothesised that seagrass loss would reduce blue carbon stocks. Using shading cloth, we simulated small-scale die-offs of two subtropical seagrass species, Halodule wrightii and Thalassia testudinum, in a dynamic northern Gulf of Mexico lagoon. The change in quantity and quality of sediment organic matter and organic carbon were compared among kill, control and bare plots before the kill treatment, shortly after the kill treatment and 11 months after the kill treatment. 210 Pb age dating was performed on bare and Thalassia plots at 11 months to evaluate the impact of sediment erosion in the absence of vegetation. 3. The small-scale die-off led to a 50-65% organic matter (OM) loss in the sediment in the top 8 cm of Halodule plots. Thalassia plots lost significant portions OM (50%) and organic carbon (C; 21-47%) in only the top 1 cm of sediment. The 210 Pb profiles indicated Thalassia die-off reduced the C sequestration rate by 10%, in addition to a loss of ~1 years worth of C stocks (~22 g m-2<). Furthermore, analyses on O Morg quality indicated a loss of labile OM/C and enhanced remineralisation by microbes. 4. Synthesis and applications: This study provides empirical evidence that small-scale shading-induced seagrass die-offs can reduce seagrass carbon sequestration capacity and trigger losses of blue carbon stocks. While the losses recorded here are modest, these losses in blue carbon storage capacity are notable due to the proximity of shading structures (for example, boat docks) to seagrass habitats. Thus, policies to avoid or protect seagrass habitats from common small-scale, shading disturbances are important for optimising both carbon sequestration capacity and coastline development and management.17-Nov-2017 Trevathan-Tackett_etal_JAE_rawdataAll data is included in one file and includes, sampling descriptions, GPS points, organic matter data, elemental and isotope data, thermogravimetric analysis data, and age-dating data.

We have studied the sediments (recovered during the Indusom cruise of the R/V Marion-Dufresne) from three different environments off this margin; a core from the highly productive surface waters (core MD85-674); a core where the oxygen minimum intersects the slope (core MD85-664); and a reference core from the deep basin with normal bottom oxygen levels and moderate primary production (core MD85-668). Though the first two environments are a priori favourable to organic matter (OM) accumulation, no marine OM enrichment can be observed in the cores. To understand this anomaly, emphasis is placed upon the transition from isotopic Stage 6 to Stage 5, because the end of the glacial Stage 6 is characterised by intensified upwelling and primary productivity in this region, whereas Stage 5 experienced a marked decrease in productivity. Various palaeoenvironmental markers, such as OM, V, Ni, Cu, Zn, Ba and P, have been used to identify periods of high productivity and/or bottom water oxygen-depletion. The results suggest that (1) the lack of marine OM in two settings favourable to organic carbon storage may be due to the nature of primary productivity. Coccolithophorid production would not be prone to OM accumulation, in contrast to the contribution of OM by diatoms or, particularly, naked phytoplankton (dinoflagellates or other peridinians); (2) Ba is not an accurate palaeoproductivity marker in this region although the oceanic environment would have been a priori suitable for the use of Ba as a proxy indicator; (3) the period of intensified upwelling in Stage 6 as well as the Stage 6-5 transition left no geochemical imprint on the sediments. This means that some upwelling systems may not be accompanied by marked enrichments in marine organic matter within the underlying sediments. In other words, the Somalia upwelling does not participate to the so-called biological pump and has no positive effect upon long-term carbon storage.",,,,,,,,,32,0,0,0,4,0,38,,,0025-3227,,,,,,,,,,,"MUSEUM NATL HIST NAT, GEOL LAB, CNRS, URA 723, F-75005 PARIS, FRANCEUNIV PARIS 06, LODYC, F-75252 PARIS 5, FRANCECNRS, UMR 121, F-75252 PARIS 5, FRANCE",,,,1996-08-01,WOS:A1996VB35700002,,

Four main results are obtained: (1) Controlled by deep-water shelf-rift, there are three suites of source rocks in the Ordos Basin and its periphery: Mesoproterozoic, Lower Cambrian and Middle-Upper Ordovician. (2) Controlled by littoral environment, paleo-uplift and platform margin, four types of reservoirs are developed in the area: Mesoproterozoic. Lower Cambrian littoral shallow sea quartz sandstone, Middle-Upper Cambrian-Ordovician weathering crust and dolomitized reservoir, and Ordovician L-shape platform margin reef and beach bodies. (3) Reservoir-forming assemblages vary greatly in the study area, with upper generation and lower storage as the main pattern in the platform, followed by self-generation and self-storage. There are both upper generation and lower storage and self-generation and self-storage in the platform margin zone. In addition, in the case of communication between deep-large faults and the Changchengian system paleo-rift trough, there may also exist a lower generation and upper reservoir combination between the platform and the margin.

In this paper the study has been extended to a large neighbouring inter-tidal area in order to establish if the above mentioned models can be generalized. As a result we have determined that the measured activity concentrations are closely to the values predicted by the theoretical models (correlation coefficient range = 0.85-0.93). Furthermore, the proposal model for granulometric facies as a function of activity concentrations of the abovementioned radionuclides provides for the sediments distribution a representation which agrees with the values of the tidal energy distribution obtained using numeric models calibrated with experimental data from current meters and water level recorders.

It can come from riverine or land-based sources, accidental and intentional discharges from ships, or as a by-product of offshore oil extraction. Growing awareness of the impact of oil pollution on the marine environment has led, since the late 1960s, to the introduction of measures to reduce or eliminate pollution from shipping and the offshore oil industry. A framework for environmental protection of the North Sea has developed over many decades through international agreements, regional cooperation, and national measures, while education has also played an important role with modern-day sailors being given due training to understand that dumping waste at sea is illegal in many areas, and is harmful to the marine environment. This paper presents data on trends in pollution from ships and oil installations. While significant reductions in oil pollution have been identified over more than two decades, there remain some areas where action is needed to reduce inputs still further, especially from oil and gas platforms. This paper illustrates that international cooperation can result in a reduction in marine pollution leading to a cleaner environment.",,,,,,,,,59,3,1,0,23,0,63,,,0018-8158,1573-5117,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Leeds, Sch Earth & Environm, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England",,,,2019-11-01,WOS:000509102300007,,

The numerical simulation was carried out using Remeshing and Interpolating Technique with Small Strain (RITSS) model. The LDFE/ RITSS results were compared with existing data. The effects of the relative thickness of the top strong clay, the strength ratio of clay layers and the size of spudcan foundation were investigated.

The weather may deteriorate facility components at a higher rate, and delay operations, emergency and evacuation procedures. Moreover, these regions host unique ecosystems, and their preservation is a worldwide priority. For this reason, a comprehensive and systematic approach for risk analysis is necessary to prevent major accidents and comply with Arctic pollution control. A novel approach for dynamic risk assessment and management, based on Bayesian Networks and safety barrier assessment, is suggested. The method is applied to the Goliat Oil&Gas platform located in the Barents Sea and risk data on the Norwegian petroleum activities are used as evidence to simulate continuous update of risk assessment throughout the years. The case study shows the benefits and limitations of such approach. Accurate modelling of potential accident scenarios is possible through BNs, but time-consuming. The approach allows for drill-down capabilities, which enhance support of operations and definition of risk mitigating measures. However, the data used for dynamic risk assessment has a pivotal role, as data quality and quantity sensibly affect the outcome. Fortunately, the Oil&Gas industry is committed to improving collection of field data for the assessment of safety barrier performance. This approach represents a strategy to process deviations and resilient reactions, regularly iterating dynamic risk assessment to support risk management of critical systems, such as the Oil&Gas production in the arctic and sub-arctic regions.",,,,,,,,,30,1,0,0,0,0,31,,,0925-7535,1879-1042,,,,,,,,,,"Sapienza Univ, Dept Chem Mat & Environm Engn, Rome, ItalyNTNU, Dept Mech & Ind Engn, Trondheim, Norway",,,,2019-12-09,WOS:000496603900027,,

The likelihood of this happening may be reduced with a data acquisition system comprising various sensors/measurement instruments housed in the anchor, where their data is then transmitted in some ways towards the seabed, and then onwards to the installation vessel.

Large mesh traps caught 53-63% less fish by number and 51% less by weight than the commercial traps. The fish in the commercial traps were significantly smaller by length, body depth and weight than those in large mesh traps, and a significantly higher percentage were immature. The effect of mesh size on fishing power of traps was investigated by comparing the catch rates of fish large enough to be retained by both trap types (i.e., body depths >5.5 cm; termed adjusted catch). The adjusted catch of large mesh traps was 24-35% lower by number and about 30% lower by weight than that of commercial traps, indicating that the fishing power of large mesh traps is substantially lower than that of commercial traps.The squeezability hypothesis and the visual image hypothesis were tested as explanations for the reduced fishing power of large mesh traps by comparing catches of commercial traps, large mesh traps and experimental traps (where experimental traps were designed to have a similar visual image as commercial traps but similar fish retention capacity as large mesh traps). The higher fishing power of commercial traps is generated primarily by a difference in catch rates in the 5.5-6.0 cm body depth size class; i.e., the size class which might feasibly squeeze through the 5.5 cm maximum aperture of large mesh traps. This strongly supports the squeezability hypothesis as an explanation for the higher fishing power of small mesh traps.We could find no definitive evidence indicating that reduced visual image of traps, whether created by structural differences (trap construction) or biotic differences (number of fish already in a trap), decreases ingress rates to traps and hence explains the lower fishing power of large mesh traps. These results will facilitate the incorporation of the reduced fishing power effect into yield per recruit models which can be used to predict catch rate changes in fisheries in which the minimum trap mesh size is increased.

The Eugene Island Block 330 field, a giant oil and gas field in offshore Louisiana, is contained within the minibasin. Based on the stratigraphic and structural analyses, we present a sequence-stratigraphic and tectonic-stratigraphic model for reservoir prediction in complex shelf Gulf of Mexico minibasins.The minibasin evolved in three phases: prodelta, proximal deltaic, and fluvial, In the prodelta phase, bathyal and outer neritic shares and turbidites loaded and mobilized an underlying salt sheet. During the proximal deltaic phase, salt continued to withdraw from beneath the minibasin, and lowstand shelf margin deltas remained at a regional fault zone on the northern margin of the minibasin. Sediment accumulation and fault slip rates were high as thick sequences of deltaic sands were deposited adjacent to the fault system. During the final fluvial phase, salt withdrawal waned; consequently, the creation of accommodation space within the minibasin ceased. The basin infilled and, during lowstands, deltaic systems prograded southward. Unconformities developed in the minibasin during these lowstands. During transgressions, thick packages of shallow-water deltaic and fluvial sands (capped bg shales) were deposited on top of the unconformities.One major reservoir, the Lentic, was deposited during the prodelta phase. The hydrocarbons are trapped by deep early faults within this geopressured sand. Most of the major exploited reservoirs of the Block 330 field were deposited in the proximal deltaic phase. Reservoirs deposited in this phase are laterally extensive proximal deltaic sands that have good lateral seals because of the amount of fault activity that occurred in this interval. Only one major reservoir was deposited in the fluvial phase. This reservoir was deposited while the basin-bounding faults were still active, so the reservoir has four-way closure, Sands deposited later in the fluvial phase tend to lack lateral seals and structural closure.",,,,,,,,,34,0,0,0,0,0,39,,,0149-1423,,,,,,,,,,,"CORNELL UNIV,DEPT GEOL SCI,ITHACA,NY 14853PENN STATE UNIV,DEPT GEOSCI,UNIVERSITY PK,PA 16802",,,,1995-12-01,WOS:A1995TJ28500003,,

Corals and matrices in limestones from the Rogers Wreck Point (RWP), offshore George Town (GT), and western onshore (WO) areas are characterized by complex diagenetic fabrics that reflect marine (bioerosion, micrite envelopes, internal sediments, fibrous high-Mg calcite, acicular aragonite, isopachous prismatic calcite cements), freshwater phreatic (circumgranular cements, even/random blocky calcite cements), and vadose (meniscus calcite cements, blocky calcite cements) diagenesis. Throughout these limestones, the matrices have undergone more meteoric diagenetic alteration than the corals. Overall, however, no systematic stratigraphic patterns exist to the distribution of these diagenetic fabrics and it is generally impossible to link the different phases of diagenesis with specific unconformities that cap each unit. These heterogenous patterns of diagenetic features can be attributed to many intrinsic and extrinsic factors, including the original compositions of the different components in the limestones, the porosity and permeability of the substrate, the nature of the diagenetic fluids, climate, and the duration of exposure during each lowstand. Integration of available data, however, indicates that maximum diagenesis took place during the lowstands denoted by the unconformities at the top of Unit C (Marine Isotope Stage 7) and Unit D (Marine Isotope Stage 5e) when long periods of exposure were accompanied by wet climates with high annual rainfalls.

During the 87-day release, scientists used oceanographic tools to collect wellhead oil and gas samples, interrogate microbial community shifts and activities, and track the chemical composition of dissolved oil in the ocean's interior. In the decade since the disaster, field and laboratory investigations studied the physics and chemistry of irrupted oil and gas at high pressure and low temperature, the role of chemical dispersants in oil composition and microbial hydrocarbon degradation, and the impact of combined oil, gas and dispersants on the flora and fauna of coastal and deep-sea environments. The multi-faceted, multidisciplinary scientific response to the released oil, gas and dispersants culminated in a better understanding of the environmental factors that influence the short-term and long-term fate and transport of oil in marine settings. In this Review, we summarize the unique aspects of the Deepwater Horizon release and highlight the advances in oil chemistry and microbiology that resulted from novel applications of emerging technologies. We end with an outlook on the applicability of these findings to possible oil releases in future deep-sea drilling locations and newly-opened high-latitude shipping lanes.The Deepwater Horizon disaster was the largest accidental discharge of oil into the environment, and was intensely studied during and after the event.

Subsea field development is trending towards subsea processing systems: the oil and gas processing equipments normally installed in the surface facility will be placed on the seabed closer to the well. This strategy is expected to increase the reservoir recovery rate, especially in marginal fields, and also to reduce total capital expenditure by eliminating the topside processing cost at the same time. Meanwhile, the processing equipment normally requires a high electrical power supply, for which the dedicated subsea electrical power and distribution units are required.Once the equipments are installed on the seabed, the cost of inspection and maintenance of these equipments increases exponentially. However, condition monitoring may enable the operators to predict the condition degradation and to plan a cost-efficient and effective maintenance strategy, with the maintenance actions being conducted based on the actual health of the equipment. The identification of subsea equipment failure modes is the key to efficient and effective condition monitoring. Potential benefits of condition monitoring include [1]: maintenance cost savings, reduced repair time and machine or plant downtime, better utilization of machinery, reduced personnel risks, improved profitability.Based on a case study of the subsea electrical power and distribution system in the Asgard subsea petroleum gas compression system on the Norwegian continental shelf (NCS), this paper maps failure modes of the equipment and identifies the relevant parameters to monitor. Furthermore, the methodology that can be used to capture parameter data is discussed as well as illustrative examples of the market-proven and market-available field measurement devices suitable for the Asgard environment to ensure the reliability of the condition monitoring system.",,,,,59th Annual Reliability and Maintainability Symposium (RAMS)59th Annual Reliability and Maintainability Symposium (RAMS),"JAN 28-31, 2013JAN 28-31, 2013","IIE; IEST; AIAA; IEEE Reliabil Soc; SAE Int; Soc Reliabil Engineers (SRE); SSS; ASQ, Elect & Commun Div; ASQ, Reliabil DivIIE; IEST; AIAA; IEEE Reliabil Soc; SAE Int; Soc Reliabil Engineers (SRE); SSS; ASQ, Elect & Commun Div; ASQ, Reliabil Div","Orlando, FLOrlando, FL",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,978-1-4673-4711-2,,,,,,,,,"Univ Stavanger, N-4036 Stavanger, Norway",,,,2013-08-21,WOS:000321693500019,,

All these problems cannot be solved without conducting environmental studies in the area of possible oil spill and performing chemometric evaluation of the data obtained looking for similar patterns among pollutants and optimize environmental monitoring during eventual spills and possible remediation actions - what is the aim of the work presented. Following the chemical and ecotoxicological studies self-organising maps technique has been applied as a competitive learning algorithm based on unsupervised learning process.Summarizing it can be stated that biotests enable assessing the impact of complex chemical mixtures on the organisms inhabiting particular ecosystems. Short and simple application of biotests cannot easily explain the observable toxicity without more complex chemometric evaluation of datasets obtained describing dependence between xenobiotics and toxicological results.

Consequently, prokaryotic communities have become well pre-adapted toward oil pollution, and many microorganisms that are exposed to its presence develop an active degradative response. The natural attenuation of oil pollutants, as has been demonstrated in many sites, is modulated according to the intrinsic environmental properties such as the availability of terminal electron acceptors and elemental nutrients, together with the degree of pollution and the type of hydrocarbon fractions present.

Monitoring and verification technologies have been tested and demonstrated to detect and track the CO2 plume in different subsurface geological environments. By the end of 2008, approximately 20 Mt of CO2 had been successfully injected into saline aquifers by existing operations. Currently, the highest injection rate and total storage volume for a single storage operation are approximately 1 Mt CO2/year and 25 Mt, respectively. If carbon capture and storage (CCS) is to be an effective option for decreasing greenhouse gas emissions, commercial-scale storage operations will require orders of magnitude larger storage capacity than accessed by the existing sites. As a result, new demonstration projects will need to develop and test injection strategies that consider multiple injection wells and the optimisation of the usage of storage space. To accelerate large-scale CCS deployment, demonstration projects should be selected that can be readily employed for commercial use; i.e. projects that fully integrate the capture, transport and storage processes at an industrial emissions source.

Reliable estimates of seal abundance are only available for two species (grey and harbour seals). For grey seals and hooded seals there is also information from telemetry studies on their distribution at sea. Data on cetaceans comes from a variety of sources including whaling statistics, dedicated surveys, observers placed on vessels of opportunity, and from bottom-mounted hydrophone arrays. These indicate that the Atlantic Frontier region is of national, and possibly international, importance for a number of cetacean species. The most abundant small cetacean is likely to be the white-sided dolphin; however, smaller numbers of large whales, including endangered blue, right, fin and sei whales, and vulnerable humpback and sperm whales are also likely to be present in summer. There is growing evidence that a number of marine mammal species respond to the acoustic and physical disturbance associated with exploration for oil and gas resources, although the ecological impact of these responses is unclear.

We used a 23-year dataset (1988-2010) tracking the abundance and distribution of Kentish Plover breeding pairs along the Galician coast to evaluate population trends and identify the underlying effects of an oil spill. A TRIM linear trend model classified the population trend as a moderate increase; the main trend exhibited a decline in the population from 2002 to 2004 (the second reproductive period after the catastrophe), followed by a moderate increase to the present. The results showed that the variation in annual population trends can be explained by considering the characteristics and location of breeding beaches. In the most parsimonious model, three covariates were significant: the beach position: inner (located in the interior part of the estuaries), or outer (exposed to the open sea), the beach length, and the location of the stretch of coastline in relation to the Prestige wreck. The variation was obvious both with regard to population size and habitat use, with an increase in the number of birds and breeding locations and changes in distribution along the entire Galician Coast after 2004. The birds reacted to the catastrophe by avoiding the most affected areas and moving to new breeding beaches, suggesting that conservation plans must take into account the correct management of currently unoccupied beaches that could provide potential habitat for the species.",,,,,,,,,3,0,0,0,3,0,3,,,0959-2709,1474-0001,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Santiago de Compostela, Fac Biol, Dept Zool & Phys Anthropol, Santiago De Compostela 15782, Spain",,,,2014-02-26,WOS:000330466900010,,

Recreational fishing is a key way that many members of the public experience the environment. The activity enhances social capital, promotes respect for nature, provides health benefits and can provide economic benefits to coastal communities. It is also an important driver of the science on aquatic animals and habitats, and an important tangible reason for many members of the public to conserve and protect aquatic resources. Overall, there has been little specific consideration of urban recreational fisheries management in Australia, despite the paramount importance of urban areas as a focus of recreational fishing activity. This paper identifies that in order to maximize individual and societal benefits from recreational fishing, there needs to be a refocussing of management with the aim of being more holistic. Historically, fisheries management in Australia has focused on maximum sustainable yield (MSY) or maximum economic yield (MEY) which is relevant for the commercial fishing sector, but neither of these is directly relevant to recreational fisheries. This paper identifies that Urban Fisheries Management Plans are required that recognize the specific issues associated with urban recreational fisheries. These plans need to coordinate within and between levels of government and have clear management objectives relevant to urban recreational fisheries. Enhanced opportunities for meaningful citizen science can be incorporated at multiple levels within these plans and this can engender public support for environmental stewardship, as well as fill a very important gap in the knowledge base necessary for managing the activity. As urban recreational fisheries are often occurring in highly modified or degraded habitats, a central element of these plans needs to be habitat restoration and this can have broader benefits for aquatic health. Other management tools include habitat creation (e.g., artificial reefs), optimization of coastal infrastructure as fisheries habitat, and stock enhancement. Overall, Urban Fisheries Management Plans represent a necessary evolution of fisheries management to better address the specific challenges of urban recreational fisheries management, and to best ensure that benefits are optimised.",,,,,,,,,17,0,0,0,13,0,18,,,2071-1050,,,,,,,,,,,"Bond Univ, Fac Soc & Design, Robina, Qld 4228, Australia",,,,2017-04-26,WOS:000398714100099,,

Negative public opinion and opposition from popular media have highlighted concerns around the detrimental impacts burning can have on the health and diversity of upland habitats. It is evident there are many gaps in the current knowledge around the environmental impacts of prescribed burning in less fire-prone regions (e.g. UK). Land owners and managers require a greater level of certainty on the advantages and disadvantages of prescribed burning in comparison to other techniques to better inform management practices. This paper addresses this gap by providing a critical review of published work and future research directions related to the impacts of prescribed fire on three key aspects of ecosystem services: (i) water quality, (ii) carbon dynamics and (iii) habitat composition and structure (biodiversity). Its overall aims are to provide guidance based on the current state-of-the-art for researchers, land owners, managers and policy makers on the potential effects of the use of burning and to inform the wider debate about the place of fire in modern conservation and land management in humid temperate ecosystems.

Fifteen accidents, major accidents and disasters for example Ecofisk 2/4 Alpha 1975, Alexander L. Kielland 1980, Songa Endurance 2016 were studied. Cases from outside of the Norwegian offshore field - the Piper Alpha 1988, the Bourbon Dolphin 2007, and the Deep Water Horizon 2010 - were also considered as comparison. For each accident and through the life cycle analysis, the occurrence stage of the accident and its main technical causes were identified and compared. It was found that a high risk is concentrated in the Operation (In -Service) stage and associated Marine Operations. Furthermore, it was observed that a high number of accidents in oil and gas industry are associated with mobile structures. All the investigated accidents have acted as powerful reminders to the oil and gas industry that a continuous improvement of risk management and reduction of uncertainty are of paramount importance in order to ensure safe operations and risk reduction for accidents, major accidents and disasters.

For each type of capital we identify more specific dimensions based on current theories of safety, management, and organizational processes. The assessment guide matches specific characteristics to each element of the framework to support assessment of safety capability.

Lipid rich copepods are an important food source for higher trophic levels in Arctic marine ecosystems. However, high lipid content and a slower metabolism increase the risk for bioaccumulation in Arctic species. Here we exposed three late development stages of the lipid rich high-Arctic copepod species Calanus hyperboreus to two different C-14-marked crude oil model compounds, the alkane dodecane (log K-ow 6.10) and the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) phenanthrene (log Kow 4.46) on a short-term scale of 4 days. Exposure was followed by a depuration phase of 3 days. We observed a difference in estimated bioaccumulation of the two model compounds between stages and found a slower depuration of dodecane than of phenanthrene in the two largest and most lipid rich stages. However, depuration of dodecane and phenanthrene was non-significant for all three stages. The results indicate that even short-term exposure may result in long-term bioaccumulation and internal exposure of oil compounds in the lipid rich high-Arctic copepods C. hyperboreus. Slow elimination and depuration of oil components indicate a risk for transfer of oil component up the food web to pelagic fish, seabirds and baleen whales.",,,,,,,,,28,0,0,0,25,0,31,,,0166-445X,1879-1514,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Oslo, Dept Biosci, POB 1066, N-0316 Oslo, NorwayAarhus Univ, Arctic Res Ctr, Dept Biosci, Frederiksborgvej 399,POB 358, DK-4000 Roskilde, Denmark",,,,2018-12-28,WOS:000424723800002,29220691,

An overview of surface and subsurface manifestations of this gas venting is presented. This gas movement has caused extensive alteration of reservoir oils to the north of the transect which are estimated to have equilibrated with, or been gas washed by, as much as 30 volumes of gas for every volume of oil. This gas washing entrains and carries upward the most volatile oil components depositing them in either shallower reservoirs or venting them to the overlying sediments and the water column. A significant amount of this gas bypasses the reservoirs and vents upward into the overlying sediments and waters. In spite of the significant amounts of the gas involved, the venting at the seafloor appears to occur primarily through highly localized faults and fractures. This gas discharge is spatially and temporally heterogeneous, making it difficult to estimate the actual hydrocarbon fluxes involved. This upward gas movement leaves characteristic signatures at the sediment water interface including carbonate pavements in older seep areas, and chemosynthetic biological communities, methane hydrates, and gas seeps in more recent long-term seep areas. In some cases where gas venting is very recent, massive disruption of surface and subsurface sediments is observed to be occasionally accompanied by mud volcanoes. Venting can be vigorous enough to produce methane gas bubbles, which appear to be injected rapidly into surface waters and which may constitute a significant source of methane, a greenhouse gas, to the atmosphere.In the northem Gulf of Mexico, gas venting is sometimes accompanied by natural oil slicks at the sea surface, which can be tracked for many miles in non-productive areas. These gas-venting signatures are not unique to the Gulf of Mexico; similar seep features are observed in sediments worldwide. The widespread occurrence of these seep features, which may or may not be related to subsurface oil and gas deposits, may explain why use of surface seeps has often proved to be so controversial in oil exploration. Indeed, most seeps are probably not linked with economic subsurface petroleum reservoirs.The relationships between surface seep features and productive subsurface reservoirs along a N-S transect of the northern Gulf of Mexico are presented as an example of how all surface and subsurface geochemical, geological, geophysical data might be used together to better constrain interpretations regarding the nature and dynamics of subsurface oil and gas deposits and their plumbing in frontier areas.

In order to determine how these interacting global change factors will affect coastal wetland productivity, we quantified growing-season carbon assimilation (approximate to gross primary productivity, or GPP) and carbon retained in living plant biomass (approximate to net primary productivity, or NPP) of North American mid-Atlantic saltmarshes invaded by Phragmites australis (common reed) under four treatment conditions: two levels of CO2 (ambient and + 300 ppm) crossed with two levels of N(0 and 25 gN added m(-2) yr(-1)). For GPP, we combined descriptions of canopy structure and leaf-level photosynthesis in a simulation model, using empirical data from an open-top chamber field study. Under ambient CO2 and low N loading (i.e., the Control), we determined GPP to be 1.66 +/- 0.05 kg Cm-2 yr(-1) at a typical Phragmites stand density. Individually, elevated CO2 and N enrichment increased GPP by 44 and 60%, respectively. Changes under N enrichment came largely from stimulation to carbon assimilation early and late in the growing season, while changes from CO2 came from stimulation during the early and mid-growing season. In combination, elevated CO2 and N enrichment increased GPP by 95% over the Control, yielding 3.24 +/- 0.08 kg Cm-2 yr(-1). We used biomass data to calculate NPP, and determined that it represented 44%-60% of GPP, with global change conditions decreasing carbon retention compared to the Control. Our results indicate that Phragmites invasions in eutrophied saltmarshes are driven, in part, by extended phenology yielding 3.1 x greater NPP than native marsh. Further, we can expect elevated CO2 to amplify Phragmites productivity throughout the growing season, with potential implications including accelerated spread and greater carbon storage belowground.",,,,,,,,,49,3,0,0,40,0,55,,,1748-9326,,,,,,,,,,,"Bryn Mawr Coll, Dept Biol, Bryn Mawr, PA 19010 USASmithsonian Environm Res Ctr, Edgewater, MD 21037 USAUtah State Univ, Ctr Ecol, Logan, UT 84322 USAUtah State Univ, Dept Watershed Sci, Logan, UT 84322 USA",,,,2015-11-01,WOS:000367249900034,,

Incorporating environmental monitoring measures into site characterisation campaigns can provide baseline information about biophysical relationships and help recognise potential impacts to the marine environment early in the development process. Concurrent measurements of fish and tidal currents were taken at a tidal energy candidate site in Australia over-2.5 months during its tidal resource assessment. Fish aggregation metrics (density, abundance, centre-of-mass (CM), dispersion, %-water column occupied, evenness, and relative aggregation) were investigated for their relation to environmental conditions (current speed, shear, temperature, diel stage, and tidal stage). Diel stage was the most significant indicator for fish density, abundance, and %-water column occupied. Fish density and abundance were elevated during strong currents, with vertical fish distribution (CM and dispersion) also influenced by current speed. Environmental conditions were able to explain up to 25% of variation in fish aggregation metrics using linear models. This study shows that early-stage environmental monitoring can successfully provide baseline information about fish aggregation responses to prevailing environmental conditions, thus reducing uncertainty risks for stakeholders of tidal energy developments.

The focus of this paper is particularly on the offshore loading operations with DP shuttle tanker in offloading from floating production storage and offloading (FPSO) vessels on the NCS, but the results may be relevant also for other types of DP vessels in offshore oil and gas operations. In the paper, Man, Technology and Organization (MTO) analysis is applied to investigate the cause and barrier failures of nine reported accidents/incidents occurring over a 16-year period (2000-2015). MTO is based on three methods, including structured analysis by use of an eventand cause-diagram, change analysis by describing how events have deviated from earlier events or common practice, and barrier analysis by identifying technological and administrative barriers which have failed or are missing. The results are categorized into technical failures, human failures, organizational failures, as well as a combination of failures. The main finding is that the majority of the accidents are caused by the combination of technical, human and organizational failures. Critical root causes, results of change analysis and barrier analysis, and combination of failures are focused in the discussion.

These samples bracket the Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill which occurred during the spring and summer of 2010. The sea bottom samples were collected as part of the recurring NOAA small pelagics survey of the continental shelf from Texas to Florida. A Shipek grab sampler was used to retrieve 37 sediment samples from the upper 15 cm of the sea bottom for analysis from the carbonate platform off of the west coast of Florida and relict sand off of the coast of Alabama. The samples were analyzed for six trace metals, Ni, Cr, Pb, vanadium (V), thallium (Tl), and mercury (Hg). The silt/clay fraction of the sediment had the highest adsorption affinity for Ni, Pb, and Tl metals relative to V, Cr, and Hg. A comparative analysis of the trace metal concentrations indicates that there is a statistically significant (at p<0.05 or p<0.01) increase in Ni, Cr, and Pb concentrations in sea bottom sediment 3 months after the oil spill. One year later, however, the 2011 samples indicate that Ni, Cr, and Pb significantly decreased (at p<0.05 or p<0.01) in comparison to 2010. Vanadium did not statistically change from 2009 to 2011. Crude oil is known to contain Vand Ni, and the V-Ni ratio (V/V+Ni) has been used as a fingerprint for the Macondo crude oil source. The V-Ni ratios for the sediment sampling years 2009, 2010, and 2011 were 0.52, 0.46, and 0.57, respectively. In this study, approximately 1 year and 3 months after the oil spill, there is evidence, such as the V-Ni ratio, that trace metal concentrations in sea bottom sediment are approaching pre-spill levels. We conclude these differences in Ni concentrations, and the V-Ni ratios are an effective means of monitoring the impact of an oil spill and the use of dispersants to alleviate the spill impact.",,,,,,,,,17,0,0,0,12,0,18,,,0049-6979,1573-2932,,,,,,,,,,"Jacksonville State Univ, Dept Phys & Earth Sci, Jacksonville, AL 36265 USA",,,,2014-01-08,WOS:000328360300007,,

The objective of this research project is to better understand the interactions between a tidal turbine and the surrounding fluid environment. Tidal turbines are a relatively new class of renewable energy devices that convert the motion of flowing water in rivers or tides into energy. This research is focused on addressing several outstanding scientific challenges that need to be overcome so that these novel devices can be developed and deployed. In addition to the scientific discoveries, the educational component of this research project involves training the next generation of engineers and professionals through research, teaching, and outreach activities. The outreach component involves partnering with Lehigh University?s Office of Outreach and Northampton Community College in the STAR (Students That Are Ready) program, which targets economically and academically disadvantaged and/or at-risk 8th to 12th grade students. The social impact of the long-term success of tidal turbine technology is significant. In addition to the continental United States, commercialization of these technologies may directly impact a major fraction of the world population as the majority of large population centers are located either close to major rivers or coastlines. The experimental design in this research project is motivated by the need to couple near and far wake physics to turbine performance at elevated levels of free-stream turbulence. Turbulence generation techniques using active grids are being used to mimic hydraulic and natural in-stream conditions. Diagnostics include a reaction torque-thrust sensor for system analysis and time-resolved stereo particle image velocimetry for flow-field measurements. A detailed understanding of the evolution of the wake is vital when considering design of a tidal farm (similar to wind farms). Designing an optimal farm layout in rivers is challenging as the useful zone for power extraction may be restricted to a small footprint due to navigational requirements. Existing engineering analysis do not fully capture the non-linear interactions that arise due to such closely packed layouts or the associated environmental impact. To enhance the scientific impact, the new data sets are being made available to the scientific community to allow validation and verification of advanced computational fluid dynamics models of flow around tidal turbines.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,1706358,,,,,,,,Lehigh University,,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:13930830,,

As a result, more than 50% of the original tidal salt marsh habitat in the U.S. has been lost. Numerous human activities have contributed directly or indirectly to wetland loss and alteration at local, regional, and global scales. Human impacts at the local scale include those that directly modify or destroy salt marsh habitat such as dredging, spoil dumping, grid ditching, canal cutting, leveeing, and salt hay farming. Indirect impacts, which can be even more significant, typically are those that interfere with normal tidal flooding of the marsh surface, alter wetlands drainage, and reduce mineral sediment inputs and marsh vertical accretion rates. These impacts usually develop over a greater period of time. At the regional scale, subsidence caused by subsurface withdrawal of groundwater, oil, and gas has submerged and eliminated hundreds of square kilometers of salt marsh habitat in the Chesapeake Bay, San Francisco Bay, and Gulf of Mexico. At the global scale, atmospheric warming clue to increased burden of anthropogenic greenhouse gases and tropospheric sulfate aerosols appears to be strongly coupled to glacial melting, thermal expansion of ocean waters, and eustatic sea-level rise. Changes in coastal water levels ascribable to eustatic sea-level rise pose a long-term threat to the stability and viability of these critically important coastal systems.",,,,,,,,,300,7,1,0,209,2,410,,,0749-0208,,,,,,,,,,,"Rutgers State Univ, Inst Marine & Coastal Sci, New Brunswick, NJ 08901 USA",,,,2001-06-01,WOS:000171383300021,,

The comparison indicates that for exposure to dispersed oil in the marine environment, the selected biomarkers were, on average, 35- to 50-fold more sensitive than the whole-organism effect. At the 5% hazardous concentration derived from the SSD for whole-organism effects, which is a conservative threshold level, the potentially affected fraction of species showing biomarker response corresponds to approximately 80%.

This presents a challenge when combining data from these different tracking systems to obtain larger sample sizes or to compare habitat use over time. In this study, we used a Bayesian state-space modelling approach to integrate tracking data from multiple tag types and standardise position estimates while accounting for location error. Harbour seal (Phoca vitulina) telemetry data for the Moray Firth, Scotland, were collated from three tag types: VHF, Argos satellite and GPS GSM. Tags were deployed on 37 seals during 1989 to 2009 resulting in 37 tracks with a total of 2886 tracking days and a mean duration of 87 days per track. A state-space model was applied to all of the raw tracks to provide daily position estimates and a measure of the uncertainty for each position. We used this standardised tracking dataset to model their habitat use and preference, which was then scaled by the population size estimated from haul-out counts to give an estimate of the absolute number of harbour seals using different parts of the Moray Firth. As expected for a central place forager, harbour seals most frequently occurred in areas close to their inshore haul-out sites. However, our analyses also demonstrated consistent use of offshore foraging grounds, typically within 30 km of haul-out sites in waters <50 m deep. The use of these statistical models to integrate and compare different datasets is especially important for assessing longer-term responses to environmental variation and anthropogenic activities, allowing management advice to be based upon datasets that integrate information from all available tracking technologies.

Fringing reef parabola, partially enclosing bays, are generally accepted as the limit of the bay dynamics. The dynamics displayed at Wreck Bay, on the southeast coast of Jamaica, however, showed the reef as the heart of main circulation and therefore the centre of the functioning bay. Results from field measurements of the spatial and temporal variability in circulation revealed that inner bay water surging from the back-reef exited quickly through a gap in the reef (channel flow, up to 60 cm s(-1)), diverged on the fore-reef, then either re-entered the back-reef to become closed circum-reef circulation (CRC), or continued along the fore-reef as open CRC. Variation in the wind regime controlled the relative importance of wind or tides to driving circulation and bay emanation. Wind speeds above 5 m s(-1) were found to be the dominant forcing factor and, combined with tides, accounted for 60% of the variability in CRC when the sea-breeze developed during early summer and again when the land-breeze strengthened during the winter deployment. Open CRC was extended seawards when channel flow currents displayed occasional surges associated with strong wind-driven currents combined with similar incident wave approach. This led to change in bay dynamics by extreme expansion in bay characteristics. The opposite scenario occurred on rare occasions of low tide with wind calms, when channel flow reversed into the inner bay and flow over the emergent reef was reduced, leading to the most extreme contraction of bay characteristics.

These processes include the biotransformation and mineralization of numerous petroleum constituents. Thus, microbial communities in the Gulf of Mexico are thought to be responsible for the intrinsic bioremediation of crude oil released by the Deepwater Horizon (DM) oil spill. While hydrocarbon contamination is known to enrich for aerobic, oil-degrading bacteria in deep-seawater habitats, relatively little is known about the response of communities in deep-sea sediments, where low oxygen levels may hinder such a response. Here, we examined the hypothesis that increased hydrocarbon exposure results in an altered sediment microbial community structure that reflects the prospects for oil biodegradation under the prevailing conditions. We explore this hypothesis using metagenomic analysis and metabolite profiling of deep-sea sediment samples following the DWH oil spill. The presence of aerobic microbial communities and associated functional genes was consistent among all samples, whereas, a greater number of Deltaproteobacteria and anaerobic functional genes were found in sediments closest to the DWH blowout site. Metabolite profiling also revealed a greater number of putative metabolites in sediments surrounding the blowout zone relative to a background site located 127 km away. The mass spectral analysis of the putative metabolites revealed that alkylsuccinates remained below detection levels, but a homologous series of benzylsuccinates (with carbon chain lengths from 5 to 10) could be detected. Our findings suggest that increased exposure to hydrocarbons enriches for Deltaproteobacteria, which are known to be capable of anaerobic hydrocarbon metabolism.

Changes to benthic community structure were assessed using ANOVA and nonmetric multidimensional scaling (MDS). The abundances of two common species (Apseudes sp. 1 and Prionospio coorilla) decreased significantly at the well-head site immediately after drilling. The size of these reductions in abundance ranged between 71% and 88%, and persisted for less than 4 months after drilling. A third common species (Katlysia sp. 1) increased in abundance 200 m east of the well-head following drilling. Most species occurred at densities too low to be analysed individually and so were pooled at higher taxonomic levels. Changes in the abundance of species aggregated by phylum varied, but significant declines in the most abundant phyla (Crustaceans and Polychaetes) of 45-73% were observed at all sites within a 100 m radius of the well-head following drilling. In most cases these changes became undetectable four months after drilling following species recruitments. MDS ordinations confirm that drilling related changes to benthic community structure are most pronounced at stations located closest to the well-head. Additionally, the ordinations indicate that modified communities persist at the well-head for more than I I months following exploratory drilling. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

CO2 enhanced oil recovery can play a significant role in stimulating CCS deployment because CO2 is used to extract additional quantities of oil. This study analyzes the investment decision of both a carbon emitting source and an oil company separately by adopting a real options approach. It is shown that when uncertainty is integrated in the economic analysis, CO2 and oil price threshold levels at which investments in CO2 capture and enhanced oil recovery will take place, are higher than when a net present value approach is adopted. We also demonstrate that a tax on CO2 instead of an emission trading system results in a lower investment threshold level for the investment in the CO2 capture unit. Furthermore, we determine a minimum CO2 selling price between the two firms and show that CO2-EOR has the potential to pull CCS into the market by providing an additional revenue on the capture plant.

Coastal sediments were sampled from two sites with different contamination levels and subjected to pre-determined pH conditions. Sediment samples and overlying water were collected for metal analysis after 10-days. The results indicated that CO2-induced ocean acidification would provoke increased metal mobilization causing adverse side-effects on water quality. The mobility of metals from sediment to the overlying seawater was correlated with the reduction in pH. Results of sequential extractions of sediments illustrated that exchangeable metal forms were the dominant source of mobile metals.

Productive regions encompass only a small fraction of the global ocean area yet they contribute disproportionately to marine resources and biogeo-chemical processes, such as fish catch and coastal hypoxia. These regions and/or the full observed range of chlorophyll concentration, however, are often poorly represented in global earth system models (ESMs) used to project climate change impacts on marine ecosystems. Furthermore, recent high resolution (similar to 10 km) global earth system simulations suggest that this shortfall is not solely due to coarse resolution (similar to 100 km) of most global ESMs. By integrating a global biogeochemical model that includes two phytoplankton size classes (typical of many ESMs) into a regional simulation of the California Current System (CCS) we test the hypothesis that a combination of higher spatial resolution and enhanced resolution of phytoplankton size classes and grazer linkages may enable global ESMs to better capture the full range of observed chlorophyll. The CCS is notable for encompassing both oligotrophic (< 0.1 mg m(-3)) and productive (> 10 mg m(-3)) endpoints of the global chlorophyll distribution. As was the case for global high-resolution simulations, the regional high-resolution implementation with two size classes fails to capture the productive endpoint. The addition of a third phytoplankton size class representing a chain-forming coastal diatom enables such models to capture the full range of chlorophyll concentration along a nutrient supply gradient, from highly productive coastal upwelling systems to oligotrophic gyres. Weaker 'top-down' control on coastal diatoms results in stronger trophic decoupling and increased phytoplankton biomass, following the introduction of new nutrients to the photic zone. The enhanced representation of near-shore chlorophyll maxima allows the model to better capture coastal hypoxia along the continental shelf of the North American west coast and may improve the representation of living marine resources.",,,,,,,,,27,0,0,0,12,0,29,,,0079-6611,,,,,,,,,,,"Princeton Univ, Dept Geosci, Princeton, NJ 08544 USARutgers State Univ, Dept Environm Sci, New Brunswick, NJ USANOAA, Geophys Fluid Dynam Lab, Princeton, NJ USAUniv Calif San Diego, Scripps Inst Oceanog, La Jolla, CA 92093 USAUniv Calif San Diego, Sect Ecol Behav & Evolut, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA",,,,2019-01-04,WOS:000452943300019,,

Applying a conventional approach to both widely distributed and deep water sites often limits the scope of geotechnical data gathering to principally remote geo-physical sensing combined with sparse sampling of questionable representative-ness. SI design can be improved to cope with distributed assets and multiple geo-hazards, while better SI sequencing and recent advances in geophysical techniques have improved the SI process considerably. However, the time and cost implications of applying these advances are potentially unacceptable when dealing with multiple facility footprints distributed over broad areas of seabed with complex, heterogeneous ground conditions, e.g., wind farm developments on the UK continental shelf. A cost-effective alternative that integrates the inter-disciplinary SI functions better and embraces probabilistic ground models is required. Applying techniques developed for seismic hazard assessment with limited data sets, probability distribution functions can be derived allowing rational, fact-based 'forecasts'. This approach permits limited datasets to be evaluated for both epistemic uncertainty (data paucity) and aleatory (natural) variability, allowing the selection of representative geotechnical parameters. Probabilistic methods and spatial analysis techniques are applied to synthetic models of the seabed for the purpose of testing the effect of sampling, size and pattern, in accurately determining soil parameters, such as the undrained shear strength and friction angle or engineering parameters like pile penetration depth. A number of different sampling patterns are examined. The results suggest that there is a relation between pattern efficiency in describing the uncertainty and the existence of spatial trends in soil parameters or the existence of features like buried channels. These approaches have the potential to increase the efficiency of offshore SI, leading to more cost effective foundation design.",,,,,12th International IAEG Congress12th International IAEG Congress,"SEP 15-19, 2014SEP 15-19, 2014",IAEGIAEG,"Torino, ITALYTorino, ITALY",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,978-3-319-09060-3; 978-3-319-09059-7,,,,,,,,,"Univ London Imperial Coll Sci Technol & Med, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, London, England",,,,2015-09-02,WOS:000359016200009,,

Determining the efficacy of mangroves in achieving climate goals can be complicated by difficulty in quantifying C inputs (i.e., differentiating newer inputs from younger trees from older residual C pools), and mitigation assessments rarely consider potential offsets to CO2 storage by methane (CH4) production in mangrove sediments. The establishment of non-native Rhizophora mangle along Hawaiian coastlines over the last century offers an opportunity to examine the role mangroves play in climate mitigation and adaptation both globally and locally as novel ecosystems. We quantified total ecosystem C storage, sedimentation, accretion, sediment organic C burial and CH4 emissions from similar to 70 year old R. mangle stands and adjacent uninvaded mudflats. Ecosystem C stocks of mangrove stands exceeded mudflats by 434 +/- 33 Mg C/ha, and mangrove establishment increased average coastal accretion by 460%. Sediment organic C burial increased 10-fold (to 4.5 Mg C ha(-1) year(-1)), double the global mean for old growth mangrove forests, suggesting that C accumulation from younger trees may occur faster than previously thought, with implications for mangrove restoration. Simulations indicate that increased CH4 emissions from sediments offset ecosystem CO2 storage by only 2%-4%, equivalent to 30-60 Mg CO2-eq/ha over mangrove lifetime (100 year sustained global warming potential). Results highlight the importance of mangroves as novel systems that can rapidly accumulate C, have a net positive atmospheric greenhouse gas removal effect, and support shoreline accretion rates that outpace current sea level rise.

These vessels are specially designed to provide services to oil and gas operations, such as anchor handling, supply and subsea operations. They have multiple engines and advanced dynamic positioning systems to ensure that they can perform their duties with high reliability at nearly any sea state. Combined with high safety requirements, this has resulted in general operational patterns with vessels running multiple combustion engines even at calm water conditions. For emissions, low engine loads yield high emissions of exhaust gases such as nitrogen oxides (NOx) and aerosols such as black carbon (BC), due to less favorable combustion conditions. The high span for these vessels between low loads and high, and their great need for potential power at short notice, motivate our examination of hybrid setups with electric: the vessel segment should be more favorable than many. We find that combining batteries with combustion engines reduces local pollution and climate impact, while the economics with current battery cost and fuel prices is good enough for new vessels, but not good enough for retrofits.

At day 21, fluorescence imaging revealed a bloom of cyanobacteria on the surface of oiled sediment cores, and the upper 1.5 cm thick sediment had 7.2 times more cyanobacterial and 1.7 times more diatom rRNA sequences when treated with oil. Photosystem II operating efficiency (Fq'/Fm') was significantly reduced in oiled sediments at day 7, implying that the initial diatom-dominated community was negatively affected by oil, but this was no longer apparent by day 21. Oil addition significantly reduced numbers of the key deposit feeders, and the decreased grazing pressure is likely to be a major factor in the increased abundance of both diatoms and cyanobacteria. By day 5 concentrations of dissolved inorganic nitrogen were significantly lower in oiled mesocosms, likely resulting in the observed increase in nifH-containing, and therefore potentially dinitrogen-fixing, cyanobacteria.

The U.S. Gulf of Mexico is a hub of oil and gas exploration and production with recognized consequences on intertidal habitats, such as the salt marsh. Following the BP Deepwater Horizon oil spill, we sampled the marine invertebrate and the terrestrial arthropod community found in stands of Spartina alterniflora, the most abundant plant in coastal salt marshes, in 2010 as oil was washing ashore and a year later in 2011. In 2010, intertidal crabs and terrestrial arthropods (insects and spiders) were suppressed by oil exposure even in seemingly unaffected stands of plants; however, Littoraria snails appeared unaffected. One year later, crab and arthropods appeared to have largely recovered. Our work is the first attempt that we know of assessing vulnerability of the salt marsh arthropod community to oil exposure, and it suggests that arthropods are both quite vulnerable to oil exposure, and quite resilient, able to recover from exposure within a year if host plants remain healthy. BP's Deepwater Horizon spill in the Gulf Coast presented an opportunity to understand how stress from an oil spill might affect variables that we were measuring in the area. The study was conducted at sites in Louisiana and Mississippi. At each site, a 100m transect was sampled within 5m of the dead zone boundary. Sampling was conducted in August 2010 and August 2011.

Whether such changes translate into shifts in the composition of sediment detritus is largely unknown, yet such changes could impact the role these ecosystems play in sequestrating CO2. We reconstructed the sedimentary records of cores taken from two sites within Botany Bay, Sydney the site of European settlement of Australia to look for human-induced changes in dominant sources of detritus in this estuary. Cores covered a period from the present day back to the middle Holocene (6000years) according to 210Pb profiles and radiocarbon (14C) dating. Depositional histories at both sites could not be characterized by a linear sedimentation rate; sedimentation rates in the last 3050years were considerably higher than during the rest of the Holocene. C:N ratios declined and began to exhibit a microalgal source signature from around the time of European settlement, which could be explained by increased nutrient flows into the Bay caused by anthropogenic activity. Analysis of stable isotopic ratios of 12C/13C showed that the relative contribution of seagrass and C3 terrestrial plants (mangroves, saltmarsh) to detritus declined around the time of rapid industrial expansion (1950s), coinciding with an increase in the contribution of microalgal sources. We conclude that the relative contribution of microalgae to detritus has increased within Botany Bay, and that this shift is the sign of increased industrialization and concomitant eutrophication. Given the lower carbon burial efficiencies of microalgae (0.1%) relative to seagrasses and C3 terrestrial plants (up to 10%), such changes represent a substantial weakening of the carbon sink potential of Botany Bay this occurrence is likely to be common to human-impacted estuaries, and has consequences for the role these systems play in helping to mitigate climate change.",,,,,,,,,101,5,0,0,77,0,111,,,1354-1013,1365-2486,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Technol Sydney, Sch Environm, Sydney, NSW 2007, Australia",,,,2012-03-01,WOS:000300671600008,,

We performed flow-through reactor experiments to examine how salt marsh sediments from varying depths respond to nitrate addition and linked biogeochemical processes to this underlying genetic foundation. Understanding the mechanistic basis of carbon and nitrogen cycling in salt marsh sediments is critical for predicting how important ecosystem services provided by marshes, including carbon storage and nutrient removal, will respond to global change. Prior to the addition of nitrate, we used metagenomics to examine the functional potential of the sediment microbial community that occurred along a depth gradient, where organic matter reactivity changes due to decomposition. Metagenomic data indicated that genes encoding enzymes involved in respiration, including denitrification, were higher in shallow sediments, and genes indicative of resource limitation were greatest at depth. After 92 d of nitrate enrichment, we measured cumulative increases in dissolved inorganic carbon production, denitrification, and dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium; these rates correlated strongly with genes that encode essential enzymes in these important pathways. Our results highlight the importance of controlled experiments in linking biogeochemical rates to underlying genetic pathways.

The distribution of the diagenetic fabrics throughout this sequence, however, is not predictable. The randomness in the degree of skeletal calcitization is shown by the lack of systematic variation in calcitization from Units A to F, and the fact that the degree of skeletal calcification in M. annularis is higher than that in A. palmate in the Rogers Wreck Point area but less than in A. palmata in the George Town cores. The stable isotope compositions (delta C-13, delta O-18) of the corals from Units A to F plot along the same trend line with their positions on that trend reflecting the amount of meteoric diagenesis they have undergone.The variable styles and degrees of diagenesis evident in the corals from the Ironshore Formation reflect (1) the variable impact of intrinsic (e.g., skeletal architecture, porosity of coral) and extrinsic (e.g., sea level, climate) factors during each phase of diagenesis, and (2) temporal effects associated with the diagenetic overprinting that took place during each successive phase of diagenesis. This means that the diagenetic fabrics are not stratigraphically ordered and that it is impossible to correlate specific diagenetic phases with specific sea level lowstands or highstands.

Seabird conservation planning within the seabird-diverse California Current System (CCS) marine ecoregion presents an important opportunity for transboundary collaborations to better protect seabirds across the USA/Mexico border. While seabird populations in the USA are relatively well-studied and well-protected, the status of seabird populations in the Mexican region of the CCS is not well known and seabird colonies have been virtually unprotected. This study synthesizes and supplements information on breeding seabird diversity and distribution, identifies and ranks threats to seabirds and evaluates conservation capacity in the Mexican CCS to provide a framework for transboundary seabird conservation throughout the CCS ecoregion. Island-breeding seabirds in Mexico support 43-57% of CCS breeding individuals, 59% of CCS breeding taxa and a high level of endemism. Connectivity between populations in Mexico and the USA is high. At least 17 of the 22 extant Mexican CCS breeding seabirds are USA/M xico transboundary breeders or foragers, 13 of which are federally listed in the USA or Mexico. Introduced predators and human disturbance have caused multiple seabird population extirpations in the Mexican CCS because breeding colonies lack legal protection or enforcement. However, conservation capacity in this region has increased rapidly in recent years through the establishment of new protected areas, growth of local conservation non-governmental organizations, and increase in local community support, all of which will allow for more effective use of conservation funds. Transboundary conservation coordination would better protect CCS seabirds by facilitating restoration of seabird colonies in the Mexican CCS and enabling an ecoregion-wide prioritization of seabird conservation targets to direct funding bodies to the most cost-effective investments.",,,,,,,,,21,0,0,0,17,2,26,,,0376-8929,,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Long Marine Lab, Santa Cruz, CA 95060 USAIsland Conservat, Long Marine Lab, Santa Cruz, CA 95060 USAGrp Ecol & Conservac Islas AC, Ensenada 22880, Baja California, MexicoCICESE, Unidad La Paz, La Paz, Mexico",Island ConservatGrp Ecol & Conservac Islas AC,,,2006-12-01,WOS:000244726100002,,

Warmer temperatures, altered precipitation patterns, longer and more frequent inundation, and saltwater intrusion will all interact to affect decomposition of plant litter in a complex way. A combination of field experiments and model selection techniques was applied to study how these environmental factors affected litter decomposition of two dominant salt marsh species, Spartina alterniflora and Juncus roemerianus, along the northern Gulf of Mexico. The results from summer field experiments conducted between June and August of 2013 showed that S. alterniflora in the low marsh had higher litter losses (0.286 +/- 0.0883 g d(-1), mean standard deviation) and decomposition coefficients (0.0115 +/- 0.00416 d(-1)) than J. roemerianus in the midmarsh locations (0.0963 +/- 0.0480 g 0.00416 +/- 0.00223 d(-1)).

To effectively characterize the soil distributions for the Chang-Bin offshore wind farm, which is an area with the greatest wind energy potential in the Taiwan Strait, we have developed a workflow to predict the soil distribution in the subsurface based on integrated analysis of seismic data and borehole data. First, we characterize the key seismic units and their seismic response in order to understand the regional stratigraphy. Then, we correlate the soil es to each stratigraphic unit as the constraint for the input and quality control to train a neural network based on seismic multiattribute analysis. Finally, we develop a neural network that is suitable for soil prediction in the Chang-Bin offshore wind farm. Five seismic units identified from the seismic profiles reveal that the regional stratigraphy has been greatly affected by sea-level change and the sediment transportation process. Confirmed by independent in situ borehole data, the neural network is considered reliable up to 60 m below the seafloor, whereas decreased signal-to-noise ratios at greater depths lead to poorer prediction accuracy. Compared to previous studies that mainly are based on high-quality 3D seismic and well logging data, our method can predict the soil distribution by analyzing 2D seismic profiles and simplified soil layers alone. The prediction results reveal detailed lithologic variations that are tested by in situ borehole measurements. Therefore, we are confident that this approach could effectively obtain the soil distribution prediction and thus reduce the costs in offshore engineering applications.",,,,,,,,,3,0,0,0,0,0,3,,,2324-8858,2324-8866,,,,,,,,,,"Ind Technol Res Inst, Green Energy & Environm Res Labs, Tainan 71150, Taiwan",,,,2021-02-03,WOS:000606163500062,,

The number of trawlers fishing illegally off Izmir which were seized by Turkish Coast Guard (TCG) between 2010 and 2014 was approximate 160. The plots of illegal trawlers caught in fishing area by TCG were marked on the map. It was obtained that trawlers fishing illegally smaller than 12 m and engine power of vessels were between 7 and 452 kW in Izmir. 98.2% of seized illegal trawlers in Izmir Bay had no fishing license and had maximum 286 kW engine power.

Supporting these operations there will be inter-modal ports and commercial vessel traffic, including Venezuelan and internationally-flagged vessels. The Gulf of Paria presents a unique geographical setting and a complex socio-cultural environment. It is remote, isolated, and harbors high levels of aquatic biodiversity that support significant fishing activities.As signatory to the International Maritime Organization (IMO) Safety of Life at Sea, Venezuela -- and the United States Marine Transportation and Security Act - are placing new security planning and preparedness requirements on oil and gas exploration and production facilities such as those proposed by ConocoPhillips. Qualifying facilities will need to have completed Security Vulnerability Assessments and considered security in their operations. However, there are currently no comprehensive SVA guidelines that companies can use to evaluate their onshore and/or offshore facilities. Furthermore, guidelines focus on security threats to existing facilities; and do not adequately address security concerns stemming from environmental and socio-economic complexities faced by many Companies worldwide.To assure successful and sustainable operations in this complex region, ConocoPhillips decided to evaluate, prioritize and mitigate for potential vulnerabilities and risks posed to their future facilities and operations based on the specific geographic, environmental and socio-cultural realities of the region. In late 2003 and early 2004, ConocoPhillips conducted an SVA meeting international and Venezuelan requirements, based on IMO and the U.S. Coast Guard standards. However, certain modifications to the methodology were needed.Results of the assessment addressed a wide range of security threats (natural and manmade, accidental and deliberate) and proposed recommendations for improvements that are being used to make changes in the final offshore infrastructure, operational and / or procedural design. The SVA completed by ConocoPhillips is consistent with the Company s sustainable development approach in the region.

A key question is whether the ecosystem services will be impaired or otherwise altered by such transformations in the balance of species. The proposed research will measure the production and storage of carbon, services critical to the maintenance of the global carbon cycle, by heavily invaded forest ecosystems on Hawaii. The goal of the research is to determine the extent to which production and carbon storage may be altered and to better understand the mechanisms responsible for any changes in these ecosystem services. Hawaii provides a model system to examine ecosystems with a long history of human influence, including extensive invasion of exotic species. This research will significantly improve our ability to adapt management needs to the rapidly changing environmental conditions imposed by invasive exotic species. This is a situation that will likely be very prevalent in the 21st century. The research will also provide training and research opportunities for undergraduate students at universities in Wisconsin and Hawaii.

With the aim of proposing criteria for conservation plans that would include ecosystem services and biodiversity, a Geographic Information System (GIS)-based approach was designed to estimate and map the value of the biodiversity and ecosystem services. The actual protected areas, namely, coastal ecosystems and Cantabrian evergreen-oak forests, were found to be important for the overall biodiversity and included some important portions of the other services. The non-protected natural forests, such as the mixed-oak, beech and riparian forests, are biodiversity hotspots, and they contribute to the carbon storage and water flow regulation services. Thus, even though these areas are small, their inclusion in conservation proposals should be considered. The pine and eucalyptus plantations contribute to ecosystem services but have negative effects on biodiversity and cause environmental problems. In contrast to the plantations of fast-growing species, the increase in broadleaf plantations will exhibit a positive trend due to the benefits they provide. Our study highlights that the inclusion of ecosystem services in conservation planning has a great potential to provide opportunities for biodiversity protection; however, strategies of conservation based only on specific ecosystem services may be detrimental to the biodiversity and may cause other environmental problems.

We reproduce the initial PFW-seawater mixing process by means of the UM3 model applied to offshore natural gas platforms currently active in the Northern Adriatic Sea (Mediterranean Sea). Chemical analyses lead to the identification of a chemical tracer (diethylene glycol) which enables us to follow the fate of PFWs into receiving waters. The numerical simulations are realized in different seasonal conditions using both measured oceanographic data and tracer concentrations. The numerical results show the spatial and temporal plume development in different stratification and ambient current conditions. The analytical approach measures concentrations of the diethylene glycol at a maximum sampling distance of 25 m. The results show a good agreement between field observations and model predictions in the near-field area.

Notably, the problem of wellhead growth is more serious in fully sealed oil and gas wells at sea. Therefore, this research on the wellbore cementation force, the wellbore lifting force, and wellhead growth for offshore oil and gas wells was critical. Based the effects on the comprehensive consideration of wellbore temperature change, annulus pressure, and performance parameters of cement sheath and casing, and then established the calculation method of cementing force, lifting force, and wellhead growth. Next, used the measured data and the data in the literature to validate the model. The results show that the calculation results of this model accord with the actual situation in the field. Finally, a gas well in the South China Sea was analyzed. Found that the increasing yield and annulus pressure will increase the height of wellhead growth, but the increasing thermal expansivity and the increasing elastic modulus of the cement sheath will decrease the height of wellhead growth. To avoid the wellhead growth, offshore oil and gas wells should adopt the submarine pipeline method (the height of the mud line relative to the deck was Zero). Thus, to improve the height of wellhead growth, the designed performance of the cement sheath, the management of annulus pressure, and the control of yield shall be introduced into the process of oil and gas field development.",,,,,,,,,8,4,0,0,0,0,13,,,0920-4105,1873-4715,,,,,,,,,,"Southwest Petr Univ, State Key Lab Oil & Gas Reservoirs Geol & Exploit, Chengdu 610500, Sichuan, Peoples R ChinaCNOOC Res Inst, Beijing 100028, Peoples R China",,,,2017-11-19,WOS:000414179100012,,

While several studies illustrate scenarios reaching these targets, there are substantial uncertainties pertaining to key assumptions, particularly long-term electricity demand and the large-scale availability of offshore wind and carbon capture and storage (CCS). This paper explores conditions under which model-based scenarios for the German electricity sector comply with the official targets for CO2 emission reductions and renewable shares. We apply the energy system model LIMES-D, which allows for a joint optimization of generation and transmission capacities. The results indicate that reducing electricity demand plays a crucial role for attaining the government's targets. Scenarios for which either offshore wind or CCS is not available show an even stronger need for a decreasing electricity demand to reach the targets and a different pattern of transmission capacity expansion than is the case with full technology availability. Hence, a broad technology portfolio could in turn hedge against future power demand increases that may challenge the joint attainment of the German decarbonization and renewable energy targets.

There is a big difference between offshore drilling and land drilling. In this process, the drilling platform floats on the fluctuating ocean surface, while the drill pipe carries the drill bit at depth of several kilometers. In the middle and deep sea areas, under the action of waves, the offshore drilling platform will not only sway around, but also rise and fall. This periodic upward and downward motion with wave will cause the periodic upward and downward motion of drill pipe string. Periodic upward and downward movement of drill pipe string will increase or decrease the hook tension, which will directly affect the change of bottom hole drilling pressure. When the drilling pressure drops to a certain limit, the bit will be out of the bottom of the well and can not be drilled continuously. Therefore, in order to ensure the normal use of offshore drilling platform and improve drilling efficiency, it is necessary to adopt heave compensation system to reduce the relative movement of drill pipe string and seabed, and maintain constant tension load, reduce the impact of natural climate such as sea breeze, wave, current on drilling platform, and improve drilling efficiency and safety. And it can prolong the service life of drilling equipment. In this paper, the working principle of offshore rig heave compensation system is given, and the design idea of the system is described in detail. Because the speed control system lacks precise mathematical model and has the characteristics of non-linearity and variability, an ADRC control strategy is adopted. The experimental results show that the controller can effectively control the compensation speed, has high control accuracy, strong anti-interference ability, is insensitive to parameter changes, and has a certain robustness.",,,,,32nd Chinese Control And Decision Conference (CCDC)32nd Chinese Control And Decision Conference (CCDC),"AUG 22-24, 2020AUG 22-24, 2020","NE Univ; Chinese Assoc Automat Tech Comm Control & Decis Cyber Phys Syst; Chinese Assoc Automat; Anhui Univ; IEEE Control Syst Soc; NE Univ, State Key Lab Synthet Automat Proc Ind; Chinese Assoc Automat, Tech Comm Control TheoryNE Univ; Chinese Assoc Automat Tech Comm Control & Decis Cyber Phys Syst; Chinese Assoc Automat; Anhui Univ; IEEE Control Syst Soc; NE Univ, State Key Lab Synthet Automat Proc Ind; Chinese Assoc Automat, Tech Comm Control Theory","Hefei, PEOPLES R CHINAHefei, PEOPLES R CHINA",1,0,0,0,0,0,1,,,1948-9439,,978-1-7281-5855-6,,,,,,,,,"Huangshan Univ, Sch Mech & Elect Engn, Huangshan, Peoples R ChinaAnhui Doije Elect Co Ltd, Res & Dev Ctr, Huangshan, Peoples R China",Anhui Doije Elect Co Ltd,,,2021-03-26,WOS:000621616903015,,

While tidal turbine sites share similar physical characteristics (e.g. strong tidal flows), similarities in their biological characteristics have not been examined. To characterize the generality of biological attributes at tidal energy sites, metrics derived from acoustic backscatter describing temporal and spatial distributions of fish and macrozooplankton at Admiralty Inlet, Washington State and the Fall of Warness, Scotland were compared using t-tests, F-tests, linear regressions, spectral analysis, and extreme value analysis (EVA). EVA was used to characterize metric values that are rare but potentially associated with biological impacts, defined as relevant change as a consequence of human activity. Pelagic nekton densities were similar at both sites, as evidenced by no statistically significant difference in densities, and similar daily density patterns of pelagic nekton between sites. Biological characteristics were similar, suggesting that generic biological monitoring programs could be implemented at these two sites, which would streamline permitting, facilitate site comparison, and enable environmental impact detection associated with tidal energy deployment.

The Triassic Yanchang Formation in the Ordos Basin is a suite of typical intra-continental lacustrine sediments that comprise the most important source rocks for the Triassic oil reservoirs. The Yanchang Formation is divided into ten subsections from top to bottom (Chan 1 to Chan 10). Three borehole successions in the southern Ordos Basin (located in the Huachi, Zhidan and Yichuan areas) cross the Chan 4 + 5 to Chan 10 subsections and have been studied using the palynofacies method combined with organic geochemistry data. Palynofacies analysis indicates that the sediments are rich in amorphous organic matter (AOM) and phytoclasts. The AOM content in all of the samples positively correlated with the hydrogen index (HI). In contrast, the transparent ligno-cellulosic fragments (TLF) + opaque particles (OP) content are negatively correlated with the HI values. Additionally, the gelified particles (GP) content has no linear correlation with the geochemistry data. Based on the quantitative composition of the particulate organic matter, three palynofacies types are identified, reflecting depositional settings in a distal dysoxic-anoxic deep basin, a shelf-to-basin transition zone and a proximal suboxic shelf. The palynofacies, total organic carbon (TOC), and Rock-Eval data together indicate that type land II kerogen are abundant in the D48 and W22 wells in the Zhidan and Yichuan areas, respectively. These kerogen types are uncommon in the L94 well in the Huachi area, which suggests low hydrocarbon generation potential. In detail, the Chan 7 and Chan 9 subsections of the three wells contain abundant type I and II kerogen, indicating that these layers are likely the two primary source rocks in the southern Ordos Basin.

For Nationally Determined Contributions (NDC) and carbon crediting schemes, BC projects need to demonstrate 'additionality', that is enhanced CO2 sequestration and/or avoided greenhouse gas emissions following management actions. This typically requires determining soil carbon accumulation rates (CAR), which is often done using radionuclides or surface elevation tables to estimate sedimentation rates. Here we undertook a case study, using Pb-210 and C-14 dating, to detect possible changes in C-org stocks and CAR following the loss and partial recovery of Posidonia seagrass meadows in South Australia since 1980-90s. The Pb-210 data revealed a lack of accumulation of excess Pb-210 in most sites, suggesting negligible accumulation of sediments, intense mixing of the upper layers, or accumulation of reworked sediments, precluding the estimation of reliable CAR at decadal time scales. This limitation was also encountered with C-14. The inability to compare sites over analogous periods of time prevented quantifying differences in soil C org sequestration, thereby to demonstrate additionality. The lack of significant differences in soil C org stocks among sites which never suffered seagrass loss, those showing recovery and those with no recovery (5.7 +/- 1.2, 4.5 +/- 0.7 and 3.3 +/- 0.3 kg C-org, m(-)(2) within the top meter, respectively) also precluded estimates of soil C org gains or losses. Our findings demonstrate that, while Pb-210 and C-14 provide important information on sediment deposition dynamics, it is not straightforward to demonstrate additionality using radionuclides in low depositional seagrass habitats exposed to hydrodynamic energy, features which may be encountered in seagrass sites. We provide insights for the selection of suitable habitats for seagrass BC projects, suggest possible alternative methods for estimating additionality, and discuss the implications of the findings for the implementation of seagrass BC strategies to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions.",,,,,,,,,12,0,0,0,8,0,12,,,0964-5691,1873-524X,,,,,,,,,,"Edith Cowan Univ, Sch Sci, 270 Joondalup Dr, Joondalup, WA 6027, AustraliaEdith Cowan Univ, Ctr Marine Ecosyst Res, 270 Joondalup Dr, Joondalup, WA 6027, AustraliaIAEA, 4a Quai Antoine 1er, MC-98000 Principality Of Monaco, MonacoUniv Autonoma Barcelona, Dept Fis, Bellaterra 08193, SpainUniv Autonoma Barcelona, Inst Ciencia & Tecnol Ambientals, Bellaterra 08193, SpainCSIC, Ctr Estudios Avanzados Blanes, Blanes 17300, SpainSouth Australian Water Corp SA Water, GPO Box 1751, Adelaide, SA 5001, AustraliaSouth Australian Environm Protect Author, GPO Box 2607, Adelaide, SA 5001, AustraliaFlinders Univ S Australia, Coll Sci & Engn, GPO Box 2100, Adelaide, SA 5001, Australia",IAEASouth Australian Environm Protect Author,,,2020-10-28,WOS:000577554400003,,

The close proximity of the rig to the Mississippi Delta raised early questions from disaster managers about possible influence of river induced circulation on oil patch evolution. In particular, it was hypothesized that the high Mississippi River (MR) discharge in May 2010 might have helped to initially keep oil from reaching coastal marshes. We have explored this intriguing hypothesis, quantifying similar and connecting patterns in the evolution of riverine and oil covered waters. We used numerical simulations, satellite and in situ data to show the unique influence of a large river plume on a surface oil patch resulting from a deep oil release. The MR induced circulation, modified by shelf and slope flows, was found to substantially influence the near surface transport of oil. The MR plume buoyancy-driven effects on oil transport had different aspects east and west of the Mississippi Delta. Anticyclonic circulation within the upstream plume region (east of the Delta, extending over the Mississippi-Alabama-Florida shelf) created a front that restrained onshore transport. Conversely, the shoreward tendency within the downstream plume region (west of the Delta, dominated by the westward, buoyancy-driven narrow coastal current) guided oil transport along the Louisiana-Texas shelf. Periods of low discharge reduced the dominance of buoyancy-driven effects, but an interval of sustained downwelling-favorable winds, combined with river induced stratification, resulted in a strong westward current and surface oil patch extension along the Louisiana coast.",,,,,,,,,57,1,0,0,24,0,66,,,,2169-9291,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Miami, Rosenstiel Sch Marine & Atmospher Sci, Div Meteorol & Phys Oceanog, Miami, FL 33149 USA",,,,2013-08-01,WOS:000324927000007,,

Median positional error rates from a reference transmitter were 1-2 m, suggesting fish positions were accurate and precise. Overall, 104 170 spatial positions were determined for gray triggerfish over the 42 d study. There were 27 instances of telemetered gray triggerfish responding to baited fish traps.

Using generalized additive models, we determined that telemetered gray triggerfish were most likely to respond to baited traps when they were initially located close to (<100 m), and down-current from, baited traps. There were substantial differences in gray triggerfish responses and water clarity across the 3 recapture periods, suggesting gray triggerfish use vision, olfaction, and perhaps sound to locate bait.

Their role as blue carbon and their capacity to mitigate climate change, by means of Natural mechanism of Carbon Dioxide Removal (NCDR) from the atmosphere, has recently gained increased attention. However, available scientific methods such as guidelines and manuals to measure carbon stock and sequestration still rely heavily on field sampling activities and laboratory analyses. Despite their accuracy, neither of these methods are applicable for large-scale carbon inventories nor are they practical in areas with limited carbon-related data and laboratory resources. Thus, it is necessary to determine whether any of the seagrass-related variables (e.g., coverage, density and biomass) may be treated as a proxy that are both robust and practical to assess the capacity of seagrass to store and sequester carbon. We developed formulas, assessed their robustness, and used both the formulas and the proxy to estimate carbon stock and the sequestration potential of the seagrasses. Furthermore, this study aims to elucidate the carbon stock and sequestration potential capacity of the seagrass ecosystems in Indonesia. We used the data of seagrass- and carbon-related variables obtained from eleven study sites and developed several candidate formulas using the Robust Linear Mixed Models (rLMMs). We found that the best formulas are comprised of multiple seagrass-related variables that consistently include biomass and coverage. This suggests that a combination of biomass and coverage is the best proxy to estimate carbon stock; however, a single proxy of seagrass coverage is recommended for practical seagrass monitoring purposes by the local government. Estimations of carbon stock and sequestration subsequently follow the formulas in the present study. Here we estimated, using a single proxy of seagrass coverage, that the above- and below-ground carbon stock, and carbon sequestration capacity of seagrass ecosystems in Indonesia reached 80-314 ktC, 196-696 ktC, and 1.6-7.4 MtC/year, respectively.",,,,,,,,,18,1,0,0,10,0,19,,,1738-5261,2005-7172,,,,,,,,,,"Indonesian Inst Sci, Res Ctr Oceanog, Jakarta 12710, IndonesiaIndonesian Inst Sci, Res Ctr Deep Sea, Ambon 97233, IndonesiaMinist Marine Affairs & Fisheries, Marine Res Ctr, Agcy Marine & Fisheries Res & Human Resources, Jakarta 10110, Indonesia",,,,2020-03-10,WOS:000516353200001,,

Research in the past decade has emphasized the quantitative significance of carbon storage in mangrove forests in climate change mitigation, mainly by determining carbon stocks and calculating potential CO2 emissions caused by mangrove degradation. However, while this approach focuses on the total amount of carbon that can be lost to degradation, it fails to capture the amount that is sequestered annually. Therefore, carbon accumulation in mangrove sediments also needs to be taken into account. This study (i) explains the differences between carbon stocks and carbon accumulation rates (CAR), (ii) it addresses the geographical variation of carbon storage and underlying factors and (iii) it assesses the global relevance of 'Blue Carbon' sequestration in mangrove sediments. Results indicate that reducing uncertainties in carbon storage estimates of individual systems requires a representative set of data that covers within-system variability. An example from Indonesia illustrates that a mangrove ecosystem with a high C stock can have a low CAR and vice versa. It is therefore conceivable that coastal environmental settings with high allochthonous supply of mineral sediment, organic matter and nutrients mostly have low carbon stocks, but high CARs. As these settings represent >80% of the global mangrove area they are most important in terms of long-term carbon storage. While a C stock is a measure of the vulnerability potential in the case of ecosystem degradation or total loss, a CAR is rather a measure of the mitigation potential of carbon storage in mangrove ecosystems. The global carbon storage in mangrove sediments of 32 Tg yr(-1) estimated from CARs in this study is at the upper end of the range of global budgets (14.6-31.1 Tg yr(-1), mean 22.9 Tg yr(-1)). It highlights that the mangrove carbon sink may be larger than previously thought, but the high variation in the global average CAR of 233 +/- 280 g C m(2) yr(-1) also indicates the need for further data.",,,,,,,,,43,0,0,0,29,0,44,,,0272-7714,1096-0015,,,,,,,,,,"Leibniz Ctr Trop Marine Res, Fahrenheitstr 6, Bremen, GermanyUniv Bremen, Fac Geosci, Klagenfurter Str, Bremen, Germany",,,,2020-12-05,WOS:000599685400001,,

During operation there are no emissions in the form of harmful gases. However there are unsolved issues considering environmental impacts such as: electromagnetism; the artificial reef effect and underwater noise. Anthropogenic noise is increasing in the oceans worldwide and wave power will contribute to this sound pollution in the oceans; but to what extent? The main purpose of this study was to examine the noise emitted by a full scale operating Wave Energy Converter (WEC) in the Lysekil project at Uppsala University in Sweden. A minor review of the hearing capabilities of fish and marine mammals is presented to aid in the conclusions of impact from anthropogenic sound. A hydrophone was deployed to the seabed in the Lysekil research site park at distance of 20 and 40 m away from two operational WECs. The measurements were performed in the spring of 2011. The results showed that the main noise was a transient noise with most of its energy in frequencies below 1 kHz. These results indicate that several marine organisms (fish and mammals) will be able to hear the operating WECs of a distance of at least 20 m.,,,,,,,,,16,0,0,0,4,0,16,,,,1996-1073,,,,,,,,,,"Uppsala Univ, Div Elect, S-75125 Uppsala, Sweden",,,,2013-07-10,WOS:000319443200013,,

The recently discovered giant Tahe Oil Field and Puguang Gas Field have provided geological entities for further studies of the formation and accumulation of oil and gas in marine carbonate sequences. Marine carbonate sequences in China are characterized by old age, multiple structural deformation, differential thermal evolution of source rocks, various reservoir types (i.e. reef-bank complex and paleo-weathered crust karst reservoir), uneven development of caprocks, especially gypsum seal, and multi-episodes of hydrocarbon accumulation and readjustment. As a result, the formation of hydrocarbon accumulations in the Chinese marine carbonate sequences has the following features: (i) the high-quality marine source rocks of shale and calcareous mudstone are often associated with siliceous rocks or calcareous rocks and were deposited in slope environments. They are rich in organic matter, have a higher hydrocarbon generation potential, but experienced variable thermal evolutions in different basins or different areas of the same basin. (ii) High quality reservoirs are controlled by both primary depositional environments and later modifications including diagenetic modifications, structural deformations, and fluid effects. (iii) Development of high-quality caprocks, especially gypsum seals, is the key to the formation of large- and medium-sized oil and gas fields in marine carbonate sequences. Gypsum often constitutes the caprock for most of large sized gas fields. Given that Chinese marine carbonate sequences are of old age and subject to multiple episodes of structural deformation and superposition, oil and gas tend to accumulate in the slopes and structural hinge zones, since the slopes favor the development of effective assemblage of source-reservoir-caprock, high quality source rocks, good reservoirs such as reef-bank complex, and various caprocks. As the structural hinge zones lay in the focus area of petroleum migration and experienced little structural deformation, they are also favorable places for hydrocarbon accumulation and preservation.",,,,,,,,,33,13,0,0,1,0,37,,,1674-7313,,,,,,,,,,,"China Petr & Chem Corp SINOPEC, Petr Explorat & Prod Res Inst, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China",,,,2012-05-02,WOS:000302296800003,,

Firstly, the proposed model is compared with a finite-element model for various intersection angles, as well as with previous analytical models considering exclusively lateral loading. Subsequently, various combinations of soil resistance forces and loading conditions that affect the examined problem are investigated.

A paucity of environmental monitoring prior to development raises questions about baseline conditions in freshwater systems in the region and ecological responses to industrial activities. Further, climatic changes prompt questions about the relative roles of climate and industry in shaping aquatic ecosystemsthrough time. We use aquatic bioindicators frommultiple trophic levels, concentrations of petrogenic contaminants (dibenzothiophenes), and spectrally-inferred chlorophyll-a preserved in well-dated sediments of a closed-basin, shallow lake similar to 50 km away from the main area of industry, in conjunction with climate observations, to assess how the biotic assemblages of a typical AOSR lake have changed during the past similar to 75 years. We examine the contributions of the area's stressors in structuring aquatic communities. Increases in sedimentary measures of petrogenic contaminants provide clear evidence of aerial contaminant deposition fromlocal industry since its establishment, while climate records demonstrate consistent warming and a recent period of reduced precipitation. Quantitative comparisons of biological assemblages from before and after the establishment of regional industry find significant ( p < 0.05) differences; however, the magnitude and overall timing of the changes are not consistent with a threshold-type shift in response to the onset of regional industry. Rather, biotic assemblages from multiple trophic levels suggest transitions to an increasingly complex benthic environment and relatively warmer waters, which, like the increasing trends in inferred primary production, are consistent with a changing climate. These findings highlight the important role of climate conditions in regulating primary production and structuring aquatic communities in these shallow systems. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Considering the studied 12 rivers, the Ibaizabal River is the major contributor, accounting for 69 % of the total particulate Pb release. On a yearly basis, Pb accumulates mostly in the West sector of the BCS. The differences between the observations for the 2000-2011 period and the modeling results could be due to the fact that SOFT used climatological information on currents and discharges from the Basque rivers (the Adour River was not included) and did not estimate the resuspension process. To improve the results, the SOFT outputs together with Hs12 data (significant wave height exceeding 12 h per year) and observed sedimentary Pb concentrations were integrated into a Geographic Information System (GIS) environment to adopt a multivariate approach. At the BCS spatial scale, the combination of numerical models and GIS-assisted statistics did not provide an accurate prediction of the distribution of river-borne particulate Pb accumulation. At smaller scales, areas influenced by the inputs of Basque rivers and others affected by additional factors (i.e., dredged material disposal activities, contributions from neighboring rivers and sub-grid scale transport processes) were identified.

In terms of Taxonomic Sufficiency (TS), the polychaete/amphipod ratio (i.e. at the level of the class/order) has been proved to be effective in identifying major changes in benthic communities following disturbances. However, an underlying issue is to assess the acceptable TS limit value needed to state accurately the quality of the benthic environment. We tested three indices using 18 series of observations carried out in five north-eastern Atlantic and Mediterranean zones impacted by oil spills, oil and gas production, brine and urban sewage, harbours and aquaculture farms within impacted and control areas.

Together this metabolic intensification of capital-nature relations can be witnessed when South Africa recently faced the Blue Economy's ecological contradictions: celebrating a massive offshore gas discovery at the same time as awareness rises about extreme coastal weather events, ocean warming and acidification (with profound threats to fast-bleaching coral reefs), sea-level rise, debilitating drought in Africa's main seaside tourist city (Cape Town), and plastic infestation of water bodies, the shoreline and vulnerable marine life.

Given how climate change has become devastating to vulnerable coastlines - such as central Mozambique's, victim of two of the Southern Hemisphere's most intense cyclones in March-April 2019 - it is essential to better link ocean defence mechanisms to climate activism: global youth Climate Strikes and the direct action approach adopted by the likes of Dakota Access Pipe Line resistance in the US, Extinction Rebellion in Britain, and Ende Gelande in Germany.

The aim is to present a new three-step method of use by emergency teams and local authorities in the assessment of shoreline and offshore susceptibility to oil spills. The three-step method comprises: (1) real-time analyses of bathymetric, geomorphological, geological and oceanographic data; (2) oil dispersion simulations under known wind and sea current conditions; and (3) the compilation of final hazard maps based on information from (1) and (2) and on shoreline susceptibility data. The results in this paper show that zones of high to very-high susceptibility around the island of Crete are related to: (a) offshore bathymetric features, including the presence of offshore scarps and seamounts; (b) shoreline geology, and (c) the presence near the shore of sedimentary basins filled with unconsolidated deposits of high permeability. Oil spills, under particular weather and oceanographic conditions, may quickly spread and reach the shoreline 5-96 h after the initial accident. As a corollary of this work, we present the South Aegean region around Crete as a valid case-study for confined marine basins, narrow seaways, or interior seas around island groups.

However, the continued rise in relative sea level threatens the sustainability of these landscapes and calls for new insights on their morphological response. While field studies of ancient deposits allow for insight into delta evolution during times of eustatic adjustment, tide-influenced deltas are notoriously hard to identify in the rock record. We present a suite of physical experiments aimed at investigating the morphological response of tide-influenced deltas subject to relative sea-level rise. We show that increasing relative tidal energy changes the response of the delta because tides effectively act to remove fluvially deposited sediment from the delta topset. This leads to enhanced transgression, which we quantify via a new methodology for comparing shoreline transgression rates based on the concept of a transgression anomaly' relative to a simple reference case. We also show that stronger tidal forcing can create composite deltas where distinct land-forming processes dominate different areas of the delta plain, shaping characteristic morphological features. The net effect of tidal action is to enhance seaward transfer of bedload sediment, resulting in greater shoreline transgression compared to identical, yet purely fluvial, deltaic systems that exhibit static or even regressive shorelines.

Most studies on carbon storage in marine ecosystems have focused on organic carbon, leaving inorganic carbon processes such as calcification unaccounted for, despite of their critical role in the global carbon budget. This is probably because of uncertainties regarding the role of calcification in marine carbon budgets as either atmospheric CO2 source or sink. Here, we conducted a laboratory experiment to investigate the influence of a calcifying alga (Corallina officinalis L.) on seawater carbon content, using a non-calcifying alga (Ulva lactuca L.) as a control. In a first part, algae were incubated separately while measuring changes in seawater pH, total alkalinity (TA) and total dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC). The amount of carbon used in photosynthetic uptake and production of CaCO3 was then calculated. In a second, directly following, part the algae were removed and DIC levels were allowed to equilibrate with air until the pH stabilized and the loss of CO2 to air was calculated as the difference in total DIC from the start of part one, to the end of the second part. The results showed that C. officinalis caused a significant and persistent reduction in total dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC), TA and seawater pH, while no such permanent changes were caused by U. lactuca. These findings indicate that calcification can release a significant amount of CO2 to the atmosphere and thereby possibly counteract the carbon sequestration in marine vegetated ecosystems if this CO2 is not re-fixed in the system. Our research emphasises the importance of considering algal calcification in future assessments on carbon storage in coastal areas.",,,,,,,,,12,0,0,0,6,0,11,,,1932-6203,,,,,,,,,,,"Dar Es Salaam Univ, Coll Educ DUCE, Dar Es Salaam, TanzaniaUniv Dar Es Salaam, Dept Bot, Dar Es Salaam, TanzaniaUniv Gothenburg, Dept Marine Sci, Kristineberg, Fiskebackskil, SwedenStockholm Univ, Dept Ecol Environm & Plant Sci, Stockholm, SwedenUniv Gothenburg, Dept Biol & Environm Sci, Kristineberg, Fiskebackskil, SwedenUniv Dar Es Salaam, Inst Marine Sci, Zanzibar, Tanzania",,,,2020-06-12,WOS:000536668200033,32348324,

Corals and oysters collected from both sampling trips had lower PAH accumulation than most bivalves collected in previous studies near the shoreline of Louisiana and elsewhere in the Gulf of Mexico. In April, total PAR (TPAH) concentrations ranged from 8.73 to 15.17 ng g(-1) in corals and 2.52 to 22.04 ng g(-1) in oysters. In May, corals and oysters had elevated concentrations of TPAH ranging from 24.28 to 79.23 ng g(-1) and 7.18 to 95.55 ng g(-1), respectively. This increase could be a result of Mississippi River flooding that occurred during that time, as evidenced by the high perylene concentrations (3.92-41.49 ng g(-1)) measured in May oysters. Oysters and corals collected in May from MC21B, the closest rig to the Mississippi River Delta, had the highest TPAH concentrations observed among all locations and the only rig to have predominantly petrogenic source inputs. Overall, given the low baseline of PAHs demonstrated in this study and the rapid accumulation of diagnostic chemicals in response to a possible contamination event (i.e. sediment plume from May flooding), oil-rig invertebrates could make excellent monitoring tools to examine the exposure to and recovery from oil (and oil-spill response options) in the offshore Northern Gulf of Mexico. Pre-spill baseline data of chemical and biological biomarkers of contamination is key to better estimating the impacts and recovery of oil exposure. Therefore, this screen of PAH accumulation represents a crucial first step in determining baseline contaminant levels in order to utilize these unique resources as monitors for offshore oil exposure in the Northern Gulf of Mexico.

The necessary link between the capture and storage processes is the transport system. Ship-based transport of CO2 is a better option when distances exceed 350 km compared to an offshore pipeline and offers more flexibility for transportation, unlike pipelines which require a continuous flow of compressed gas. Several feasibility studies have been undertaken to ascertain the viability of large-scale transportation of CO2 by shipping in terms of the liquefaction process, and gas conditioning, but limited work has been done on reducing emissions from the ship's engine combustion.From 2020, ships operating worldwide will be required to use fuels with 0.5% or lower sulphur content (versus 3.5% now) or adopt adequate measures to reduce these emissions. This study explores the use of the solvent-based post-combustion carbon capture and storage (CCS) process for CO2 and SO2 capture from a typical CO2 carrier. A rate-based aqueous ammonia process model was developed, validated, then scaled up and modified to process flue gas from a Wartsila 9L46 F marine diesel engine. Different modes of operation of the carrier were analysed and the most efficient mode to operate the CCS system is during sailing. The heat recovered from the flue gas was used for solvent regeneration. A sensitivity study revealed that the 4 MWth supplied by the waste heat recovery system was enough to achieve a CO2 capture level of 70% at a solvent recirculation flowrate of 90-100 kg/s. The removal of SO2 by the ammonia water solution was above 95% and this led to the possibility of producing a value-added product, ammonium sulphate. The boil-off gas and captured emitted CO2 were recovered using a two-stage re-liquefaction cycle and re-injected into the cargo tanks, thereby reducing extra space requirements on the ship.",,,,,14th International Conference on Greenhouse Gas Control Technologies (GHGT)14th International Conference on Greenhouse Gas Control Technologies (GHGT),"OCT 21-25, 2018OCT 21-25, 2018",,"Melbourne, AUSTRALIAMelbourne, AUSTRALIA",18,0,0,0,0,0,19,,,1750-5836,1878-0148,,,,,,,,,,"Cranfield Univ, Sch Water Energy & Environm SWEE, Cranfield MK43 0AL, Beds, England",,,,2019-08-16,WOS:000478732600005,,

There is a strong possibility, therefore, that drilling for oil and gas offshore British Columbia will begin in the near future. Some coastal communities, hard-hit by resource problems in forestry and fisheries with attendant unemployment and out-migration, have been lobbying in favour of lifting the moratorium, while environmentalists and some First Nations people have been lobbying equally as hard for its continuance. Predicated on the assumption that BC may well be on the verge of developing an offshore petroleum industry, this article essay explores several issues related to the development of such an industry. It poses the question: if the province is to develop an offshore oil and gas industry, how should it go about it in as environmentally and socially responsible a way as possible?Fortunately for British Columbia, two provinces on Canada's east coast, Newfoundland and Labrador, and Nova Scotia, already have established offshore petroleum industries. They have a 40-year history of experiences in both the exploration and production phases of offshore development. This essay provides an overview of the Atlantic Canadian and North Sea experiences. It argues that it is, in principle at least, feasible to manage offshore developments in a socially and environmentally responsible way, and in such a way that local people and communities, including First Nations, can be beneficiaries. There is nothing automatic about this, however. It will require enlightened governance at both the provincial and federal level, and a willingness to devolve to effected communities enough decision-making authority to negotiate with the oil companies from a position of strength. Success will depend on local people becoming well informed about the industry and taking the lead in determining the conditions under which development can proceed.",,,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,,,0021-9495,,,,,,,,,,,"Mem Univ Newfoundland, Dept Sociol, St John, NF A1C 5S7, CanadaMem Univ Newfoundland, Inst Social & Econ Res, St John, NF A1C 5S7, Canada",,,,2003-12-01,WOS:000236751200002,,

Yet with limited funds for conservation of threatened species and ecosystems there is a desire to identify priority areas where investment efficiently conserves multiple ecosystem services. We mapped four mangrove ecosystems services (coastal protection, fisheries, biodiversity, and carbon storage) across Fiji. Using a cost-effectiveness analysis, we prioritised mangrove areas for each service, where the effectiveness was a function of the benefits provided to the local communities, and the costs were associated with restricting specific uses of mangroves. We demonstrate that, although priority mangrove areas (top 20%) for each service can be managed at relatively low opportunity costs (ranging from 4.5 to 11.3% of overall opportunity costs), prioritising for a single service yields relatively low co-benefits due to limited geographical overlap with priority areas for other services. None-the-less, prioritisation of mangrove areas provides greater overlap of benefits than if sites were selected randomly for most ecosystem services. We discuss deficiencies in the mapping of ecosystems services in data poor regions and how this may impact upon the equity of managing mangroves for particular services across the urban-rural divide in developing countries. Finally we discuss how our maps may aid decision-makers to direct funding for mangrove management from various sources to localities that best meet funding objectives, as well as how this knowledge can aid in creating a national mangrove zoning scheme.

Less attention is currently paid to some of the major onshore oil and gas developments in the Russian North, where production is ongoing, often since Soviet times, and in many cases with significant impacts on fragile arctic ecosystems. Such projects also have considerable (positive and negative) social impacts for Russia's indigenous and local populations, many of whom depend on the land and waters of oil-bearing regions for their livelihoods. Thus, the sustainability of Russia's arctic oil and gas industry is of critical importance whether or not the activities are taking place offshore in the glare of international scrutiny. Usinsk Rayon (county) in Russia's Komi Republic grabbed international headlines in 1994 with one of the world's biggest oil spill disasters, but today is much less well known internationally, despite continuing to suffer regular spills. This article explores the current situation in Usinsk Rayon, comparing global sustainability standards and companies' understandings of their own responsibilities to society with the ways that 'corporate social responsibility' in practice is perceived locally.

The method is demonstrated for carbon storage using representative cost and distribution data from recent studies of storage in the European region.Carbon storage comprises four technology variants defined by the nature of the storage reservoir - (onshore or offshore) depleted oil & gas reservoirs and (onshore or offshore) saline aquifers - and each variant has a different learning rate reflecting its different cost structure. Moreover, the proportional contribution of each variant to total storage is likely to change with the growth of global storage capacity.

Bowheads are an important subsistence and cultural resource for coastal people of northern Alaska. Until recently, the entire Bering-Chukchi-Beaufort stock was thought to migrate through the Beaufort Sea twice annually: during their eastward, spring migration and their westward, fall migration. Recent summer sightings indicate some bowheads may stay in the Bering and Chukchi Seas and not enter the Beaufort at all. The importance of the Beaufort Sea for feeding is also in question due to conflicting study results. Oil and gas leasing, exploration, development, and production are ongoing in the Alaskan Beaufort Sea and there is interest in pursuing such activities in the Chukchi Sea. Therefore, greater understanding of bowhead migration and feeding behavior and an increased knowledge of important feeding and summering areas are necessary for the conservation and management of the species. Satellite transmitters deployed on bowhead whales along their migration route can provide information on migration routes, migration timing, swim speed, diving behavior, residence times in portions of their range, and responses to industrial activity. Working with the Alaska Eskimo Whaling Commission (AEWC), the North Slope Borough, the Minerals Management Service, the National Marine Fisheries Service, BP Alaska, Inc., and Conoco Phillips we have cooperatively identified the priority objectives and procedures that are acceptable to all parties.

The dominant feature of this shallow ocean off the coast of countries in Western Africa is the Guinea Current. The distinctive bathymetry, hydrography, productivity and trophodynamics of this shallow ocean qualify it as a large marine ecosystem (LME) and is indeed recognized as the number 28 of the 64 delineated LMEs globally. This area is one of the world's productive marine areas that is rich in fishery resources, oil and gas reserves, precious minerals and an important global reservoir of marine biological diversity. Unfortunately, pollution from residential and industrial sources has affected the waters of the Gulf of Guinea resulting in habitat degradation, loss of biological diversity and productivity, and degenerating human health. In reversing this trend of marine environmental degradation, the countries of the region adopted an integrated and holistic approach using the LME concept to sustainably manage the environmental and living resources of the region. The concept is predicated on the fact that marine environmental pollution and living resources respect no political or geographical boundaries and so require a holistic and regional approach for its management. The Gulf of Guinea countries through the Global Environment facility funded regional/communal project on water pollution control and biodiversity conservation achieved a paradigm shift in living resources and environmental management in the region using the LME concept.

I then draw from 2 decades of experience as an academic marine ecologist and biological oceanographer to extract general lessons from each case on how environmental applications could be improved by better use of the wisdom of the field of ecology. The eight cases respresent four pairs of contrasts covering a spectrum of applications of ecological science to environmental problems: (i) two assessments of the environmental impacts from coastal ocean discharges, one evaluated by data collected under traditionally designed, self-monitoring programmes largely mandated by the agency granting the discharge permit and the other employing an academically designed programme of explicit impact testing; (ii) two assessments of the effects of offshore oil and gas development, one done before exploration drilling to assess the adequacy of available environmental information on which to base decisions about drilling permits and the other an analysis of natural resource damages after a coastal oil spill had occurred; (iii) two evaluations of environmental problems conducted by special ad hoc panels created to resolve the environmental disputes; and (iv) two examples of how rule-making commissions employed ecological insights in the establishment of regulations, in one case to preserve environmental quality and in the other to manage natural fishery resources.From the experience of these eight cases, I derive 38 lessons for the future improvement of environmental problem solving by better use of ecological sciences. These lessons fall into four categories: (i) improvements in study design and analysis; (ii) recognition of the importance of the multi-species, multi-factor ('ecosystem') context in which populations are nested; (iii) acknowledgement of how social concerns constrain environmental decisions; and (iv) identification of common fallacies in environmental assessment.",,,,,,,,,61,0,0,0,9,0,63,,,0307-692X,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1993-03-01,WOS:A1993LW46000003,,

In particular, this applies to species with free-living pelagic larvae that aggregate in surface waters and under the sea ice where hydrocarbons are likely to remain for extended periods of time due to low temperatures. We exposed the positively buoyant eggs of polar cod (Boreogadus saida), an arctic keystone species, to realistic concentrations of a crude oil water-soluble fraction (WSF), mimicking exposure of eggs aggregating under the ice to oil WSF leaking from brine channels following encapsulation in ice. Total hydrocarbon and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon levels were in the ng/L range, with most exposure concentrations below the limits of detection throughout the experiment for all treatments. The proportion of viable, free-swimming larvae decreased significantly with dose and showed increases in the incidence and severity of spine curvature, yolk sac alterations and a reduction in spine length. These effects are expected to compromise the motility, feeding capacity, and predator avoidance during critical early life stages for this important species. Our results imply that the viability and fitness of polar cod early life stages is significantly reduced when exposed to extremely low and environmentally realistic levels of aqueous hydrocarbons, which may have important implications for arctic food web dynamics and ecosystem functioning.

Low substrate complexity on a wreck (the 'Benwood') facilitated the location and identification of recently settled coral recruits (< 1 min). Increased adult cover and changes in substrate composition (mainly the presence of crustose coralline algae) enhanced local recruitment, indicating that positive changes in substrate composition acted as an important factor enhancing coral recruitment. Spatial differences in the number of arriving recruits dictated future patterns in local population density as mortality probabilities did not vary spatially. S. radians populations showed the potential to be regulated in a density-dependent manner as suitable settlement substrate was, or could become, limited by (1) its natural availability or (2) preemption by growing adults. Adult removal resulted in a 46% decrease in local (< 1 m(2)) recruitment, indicating that S. radians populations were facultatively closed at this spatial scale. Therefore, the S. radians/Benwood system allows for a detailed description of the processes that create structure in coral populations.

Planktonic communities along the south coast were studied before and after the flooding. Flood waters from Kingston Harbour flowed southwest along the Hellshire coast as far as Wreck Reef, but were confined within 4 km of the shore- Water in the bays along the lower Hellshire coast remained clear and unaffected by Harbour water, although planktonic communities there showed marked changes. The Port Royal Cays area and much of the shelf was unaffected. During the flood, the normal gradient of decline in planktonic indices (biomass, abundance, and community similarity) with distance from the Harbour was disrupted. The extent of flooding was evident from dramatic reductions in salinity and increases in extinction coefficient; temperatures were lowered by only 1 to 2-degrees-C. Flood effects were confined to the upper water column; whereas, surface salinity and phytoplankton were dramatically changed, they remained largely unaffected at 7 m depth. In surface waters, the number of phytoplankton cells increased up to 4 x 10(6) per liter (5 times greater than normal) while biomass increased to 30 mg Chl. a/m3 (10 times normal) and primary production reached 20.5 mg C/m3/hr (20 times normal). These large increases in both biomass and primary production occurred primarily in the nanoplankton size fraction (2-20 mum) which was dominated by Protoperidinum spp. Within a week however, the larger net plankton (>20 mum) assumed dominance. These high values were short-lived as phytoplankton communities returned to normal within two weeks of the flood. Zooplankton abundances at first decreased sharply in response to flooding (e.g., from approximately 20,000 to 200/m3), but reattained normal values within four weeks following the flood. In some areas (e.g., Harbour mouth, Great Salt Pond) there was a subsequent 10-fold increase in zooplankton abundance (up to 209,000/m3) comprising mainly larval stages.

These activities also create imbalances which are reflected in alterations in the global climate, increased pollution and resource depletion which require preventive and mitigation measures. The fact that populations settle largely on the coast where most human activities take place brings increased risks of environmental degradation to coastal and estuarine areas which can take various forms. Many of these issues are common to other countries, or even global, but others are regional, affecting mostly local communities and are especially relevant nationally. High quality R&D institutions in marine and environmental sciences are needed to cope with those great challenges of modern society.The CIMAR LA was founded in 2002 with the mission to carry out basic and applied research on the biological, physical and chemical processes in aquatic ecosystems, including the impacts of human activity on these ecosystems, and to promote environmental sustainability and the rational exploration of ecosystem services by providing scientific knowledge and technology for environmental risk assessment, management, and conservation.The CIMAR LA views itself as a key Portuguese partner in European and global marine science and technology, ready to lead the translation of marine technologies from the lab to the economy. Our past efforts prove that such vision is tangible, such as shown by the growing scientific output (e.g., 1300 scientific articles in the last 5 years) or by its participation in public policies and actions (e.g., founder of Consortium OCEANOS, member of the European Science Foundation Marine Board, member of national and international networks and consortia, including those involved in regional development). The CIMAR LA key research themes to be covered in the next years are: 1) Climate Change; 2) Biodiversity, Phylogenetics, and Evolution; 3) Ecosystem Functioning, Conservation and Habitat Restoration; 4) Marine Environmental Toxicology and Human Health; 5) Coastal Dynamics; 6) Resource Management and Fisheries; 7) Biochemistry and Physiology of Marine Organisms; 8) Aquaculture and Marine Biotechnology. The proposed themes will be developed under current four Research Lines: 1) Ecology, Biodiversity and Management of Aquatic Ecosystems; 2) Environmental Chemistry and Toxicology; 3) Biology and Marine Biotechnologies; 4) Aquaculture. Each of the key Themes and Lines is contributed by several research groups and each research group may contribute to several Themes and Lines. The Themes and underlying strategic Lines take into account research needs, and public and political concerns expressed in international and national regulatory documents, such as [1] Blue Book on An Integrated Maritime Policy for the EU (2007); [2] Marine Strategy Framework Directive (2008); [3] Adapting to climate change: Towards a European framework for action (2009); [4] Marine Biotechnology: A New Vision and Strategy for Europe (2010); [5] [6] [7] Resoluções do Conselho de Ministros 163/2006, 40/2007, and 119/2009.The CIMAR LA is a multidisciplinary institution, and consequently data from different levels of biological organization, from the molecular (e.g., genomics) to ecosystem (e.g., energy flux and nutrient cycles) levels will be integrated using advanced statistics and models to understand, for example, patterns of larvae dispersion, fish migrations, changes in species distribution potentially induced by global changes, and environmental risks of both climate changes and anthropogenic activities. Advantage will be also taken from the location of CIMAR LA laboratories in different geographic areas of the country (Porto, Faro, Azores and Madeira) where research is being carried out by CIMAR members or in partnership with other national and international institutions to have a wide overall view and understanding of large scale phenomena. Technology transfer to government and industry will be done by promoting joint actions, including projects in partnership, workshops and courses. Regarding science communication and outreach activities, CIMAR LA will promote open visits to our labs and other facilities, special programs and visits for schools and for the general public, talks and conferences, in addition to different activities in cooperation with Ciência Viva Centres, Environmental Monitoring and Interpretation Centres in partnership with Municipalities, and with several Universities.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,PEst-C/MAR/LA0015/2011,,,,,,,,Centro de Investigação Marinha e Ambiental,Centro de Investigação Marinha e Ambiental,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:15423826,,

Southeast Asia, and is bounded by the Asian continent, Philippine Archipelago, and Great Sunda Islands. Due to the wide shelves on its northwestern and southern ends as well as the presence of numerous islets, atolls and reefs, the average depth of the SCS is only 1350 m. In this study we used measurements of the transient tracer CFC-11 from the SCS to calculate ventilation time-scales and the concentration of anthropogenic CO2 (C-ant) based on the transit time distribution. The CFC-11 concentrations decreased consistently with depth and the deep and bottom water in the SCS had a CFC-11 value close to the detection limit (0.01 pmol kg(-1) or 0.5 ppt). The ventilation times (mean ages) for the deep and bottom water column were similar to 500-600 years, and based on the mean age profiles the southern part of the intermediate SCS water was older than the northern part. The ventilation time distribution was in agreement with the existence of mean annual cyclonic circulation in the SCS. The mean column inventory of C-ant in the northern SCS was 28.9 mol Cm-2 (error range (ER): 22.8-35.6 mol Cm-2), while in the southern SCS it was 28.4 mol m(-2) (ER: 21.9-35.2 molCm(-2)). The total C-ant inventory was estimated to be 1 Pg C (ER: 0.8-1.3 Pg C, referenced to the year 2011), suggesting that the SCS stores less C-ant then the adjacent seas. The vertical diffusivity was estimated to be 2-4.6 x 10(-4) m(2) S-1 in the SCS based on the transient steady state. The upwelling was estimated as 13-34 myr(-1). The high diffusivity was probably due to the strong internal tide, while the strong upwelling was due to the persistent counterclockwise (cyclonic) circulation. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

The biodegradation of crude oil by microorganisms co-incubated from sediments collected from the Penglai 19-3 oil platform, Bohai Sea, China, was examined. The relative susceptibility of the isomers of alkylnaphthalenes, alkylphenanthrenes and alkyldibenzothiophene to biodegradation was also discussed. The results showed that the relative degradation values of total petroleum hydrocarbon (TPH) are 43.56% and 51.29% for sediments with untreated microcosms (S-BR1) and surfactant-treated microcosms (S-BR2), respectively. TPH biodegradation results showed an obvious decrease in saturates (biodegradation rate: 67.85-77.29%) and a slight decrease in aromatics (biodegradation rate: 47.13-57.21%), while no significant difference of resins and asphaltenes was detected. The biodegradation efficiency of alkylnaphthalenes, alkylphenanthrenes and alkyldibenzothiophene for S-BR1 and S-BR2 samples reaches 1.28-84.43% and 42.56-86.67%, respectively. The efficiency of crude oil degradation in sediment with surfactant-treated microcosms cultures added Tween 20, was higher than that in sediment with untreated microcosms. The biodegradation and selective depletion is not only controlled by thermodynamics but also related to the stereo chemical structure of individual isomer compounds. Information on the biodegradation of oil spill residues by the bacterial community revealed in this study will be useful in developing strategies for bioremediation of crude oil dispersed in the marine ecosystem.",,,,,,,,,43,5,0,0,28,0,48,,,0147-6513,1090-2414,,,,,,,,,,"Chinese Acad Sci, Yantai Inst Coastal Zone Res, Key Lab Coastal Zone Environm Proc & Ecol Remedia, Yantai 264003, Peoples R ChinaNatl Marine Environm Monitoring Ctr, Dalian 116023, Peoples R China",,,,2018-12-28,WOS:000436057700003,29730405,

During the 2010 Deepwater Horizon (DWH) spill, oil exposure killed marsh plants in some regions and contributed to rapid compositional shifts in sediment microbial communities, which can impact ecosystem denitrification capacity. Within 3-5 years of the spill, plant biomass and microbial communities in some impacted marshes can recover to a new stable state. The objective of this study was to determine whether marsh recovery 6 years after the DWH oil spill results in subsequent recovery of denitrification capacity. We measured denitrification capacity (isotope pairing technique), microbial 16S rRNA gene composition, and denitrifier abundance (quantitative PCR) at sites subjected to light, moderate, and heavy oiling during the spill that were not targeted by any clean-up efforts. There were no differences in plant belowground biomass, sediment extractable NH4+, inorganic nitrogen flux, 16S rRNA composition, 16S rRNA diversity, or denitrifier functional gene (nirS, norB, and nosZ) abundances associated with oiling status, indicating that certain drivers of ecosystem denitrification capacity have recovered or achieved a new stable state six years after the spill. However, on average, denitrification capacities at the moderately and heavily oiled sites were less than 49% of that of the lightly oiled site (27.7 +/- 14.7 and 37.2 +/- 24.5 vs 71.8 +/- 33.8 mu mol N m(-2) h(-1), respectively). The presence of heavily weathered oiled residue (matched and non-matched for MC252) had no effect on process rates or microbial composition. The loss of function at the moderately and heavily oiled sites compared to the lightly oiled site despite the comparable microbial and environmental factors suggests that oiling intensity plays a role in the long-term recovery of marsh ecosystem services.

We demonstrate how prior knowledge of the advective flow can be used to aid optimal positioning of monitoring stations capable of detecting seeps from anywhere in the area. As an example, a three-detector layout is proposed for a test site in Bass Strait, Australia, and an associated seep detection limit and monitoring time-scale for seep confirmation is identified. Dilution of the dissolved plume places strict limits on the minimum seep size that can be detected and depends non-linearly on the number of instruments used. Implications of the patchy nature of the dissolved plume, the potential future use of mobile detectors, and ability to account for background environmental variability, are highlighted.

In Mexico, ammonia production is being promoted by the government, but this development is associated with several environmental impacts. This study examines the causes, effects and mitigation alternatives related to the installation and operation of an ammonia production plant adjacent to a coastal lagoon. A multiplicity of causes (and effects) was identified: water suction (elimination of plankton and larvae), effluent discharge (thermal contamination, salinization, and the effects of chlorine), and the conversion of wetlands (loss of habitat and nursery areas, biodiversity, fishery benefits, retention of contaminants, coastal stabilization, carbon storage and aesthetic value). At present, it is estimated that wetlands (9146 ha mangroves + 22,641 ha others) in the Ohuira-Topolobampo lagoon sustain the production of 3000 t live weight of seafood catches per year, implying that the conversion of 126 ha of wetlands could represent for fishermen a catch reduction of 11.9-41.3 t of shellfish per year and a decrease in the annual retention load of up 0.52 kg Cd, 41.0 kg Cu, 0.40 kg Hg, 280 kg Pb, 88.2 t P and 75.6 t N by wetland sediments. To mitigate the environmental effects associated with the installation and operation of the plant, the following is recommended: (i) afforestation of an equivalent area (126 ha), (ii) installation of an exclusion system for fauna to avoid the incidental capture of plankton and larvae, (iii) the use of cooling towers, and (iv) the selection of an appropriate discharge point for the effluent.

Non-availability of easily accessible compatible sand or mixed sediment (sand plus silt) leaves the populace and ecosystem of coastal Louisiana at risk and adversely impacts the nation's oil and gas industries. It is clear that restoration of wetlands and barrier islands is critically dependent on both quality and quantity of suitable sediment. It is thus imperative that a proper sediment management plan be developed to meet long term needs. Presently, exploration for sand and mixed sediments is guided by project-specific protocols. The cost as well as the success of a project is defined by the sediment selection process. Better planning and management of multiple-user-conflicts requires regional understanding of sediment resources that would result in a more beneficial approach. Regional sediment management, which helps protect, preserve, and properly distribute sand and mixed sedimentary deposits, would best be achieved by inter-agency coordination so that identified sediment resources would not be subsequently traversed by oil and gas pipelines or infrastructure. Integration of sediment management plans are needed because sediment budgets are not independent systems. Instead of looking at project specific needs, it is posited that a programmatic approach be adopted to effectively manage the demand for large sediment volumes needed to restore sustainability in the Louisiana coastal zone.",,,,,10th International Coastal Symposium (ICS 2009)10th International Coastal Symposium (ICS 2009),"APR 13-18, 2009APR 13-18, 2009","Coastal Educ Res Fdn; Ctr Estud Geograf Planeament Reg; Univ Nova Lisbon, Fac Cienc Soc HumanasCoastal Educ Res Fdn; Ctr Estud Geograf Planeament Reg; Univ Nova Lisbon, Fac Cienc Soc Humanas","Lisbon, PORTUGALLisbon, PORTUGAL",11,0,0,0,7,0,11,,,0749-0208,,,,,,,,,,,"Louisiana Off Coastal Protect & Restorat, Baton Rouge, LA 70801 USACoastal Planning & Engn Inc, Coastal Geol & Geomat, Boca Raton, FL 33431 USA",Louisiana Off Coastal Protect & Restorat,,,2009-01-01,WOS:000266722400085,,

However, for environments in which such indicator species do not occur naturally and cannot be deployed, alternative approaches for monitoring trace-metal pollution are required. Three years after the 2011 grounding of the MV Rena, diffusive gradients in thin films (DGT) samplers were deployed at Otaiti (the offshore reef where the Rena grounded) to assess levels of waterborne trace-metal contamination. Although the probability of detecting waterborne contaminants within a dynamic open ocean reef environment would seem low, due to mixing and dilution, our analyses confirmed the presence of copper (≤0.43 vs ≤0.27 nmol kg1), iron (≤6.3 vs ≤4.2 nmol kg1), aluminium (≤8.9 vs ≤1.3 nmol kg1), zinc (≤2.8 vs ≤2.0 nmol kg1) and manganese (≤0.11 vs ≤0.09 nmol kg1) at elevated concentrations in the Rena debris field relative to reference sites. The results demonstrate the utility of DGTs as a tool for measuring waterborne contaminants and suggest further research is required to characterise the contaminant plume and determine what effect it might have on the recovery of Otaiti's impacted biological communities.

Our groups use these assets to conduct explorations of shipwreck sites from the last major battle of the American Revolution, the Battle of Yorktown. Students work in mission teams with objectives that change from session to session in ways reflective of actual expeditions using these technologies. Some examples of sessions include: deconstructing the system diagram of an ROV in order to troubleshoot its operation, measuring currents over the wreck site by timing particles passing by on the ROV's real-time video, recording biota seen on and around the wreck debris field, constructing a logical search pattern to locate a known wreck site, interpreting sidescan sonar imagery from sites thought to possess wrecks that may be eroding out of the sediment, and performing sophisticated maintenance, repair, systems checks, and upgrades to both robots. During vehicle deployments, students operate as a cross-trained team, with rotation of duties during deployment, including pre-launch system checker, deployer (into the water), navigator, data logger, chief mission supervisor, cable (ROV) or RF tracking (AUV) operator, and safety observer.

In the present work, a methodology for the selection of inherently safer solutions was developed as a support tool for decision-making in early design activities of offshore oil & gas installations. The expected inherent safety performance of alternative design options is assessed by means of a comprehensive set of key performance indicators (KPIs) based on the simulation of consequences of offshore accident scenarios and credit factors of the possible loss of containment events from offshore equipment. The proposed KPIs aim to capture the hazard level of single units and to address selectively multiple targets of the potential threats than personnel and process equipment on the installation, such as marine organisms on the sea environment. Moreover, overall aggregated KPIs were introduced as a sound synthetic measure of the inherent safety performance of the offshore system. The method was applied to the assessment of alternative designs of an offshore production facility, particularly characterized by environmental and safety concerns. The results from the case study evidenced the capability of the proposed method in ranking the potential and credible critical units of each alternative configuration and identiffing the relative magnitude of targets contributions to the global safety profile of the installation.",,,,,"37th ASME International Conference on Ocean, Offshore and Arctic Engineering37th ASME International Conference on Ocean, Offshore and Arctic Engineering","JUN 17-22, 2018JUN 17-22, 2018","ASME, Ocean Offshore & Arct Engn DivASME, Ocean Offshore & Arct Engn Div","Madrid, SPAINMadrid, SPAIN",1,0,0,0,0,0,1,,,2153-4772,,978-0-7918-5122-7,,,,,,,,,"Univ Bologna, Dept Civil Chem Environm & Mat Engn, Via Terracini 28, I-40131 Bologna, Italy",,,,2018-11-27,WOS:000449723800055,,

These are characteristic of the basal 'Hot Shale' and the overlying deposits, referred to here as the Cold Shale. The former reflects deposition in distal suboxic anoxic conditions and is dominated by highly oil-prone amorphous organic matter (AOM) typical of deposition in generally anoxic, restricted marine basins. Only a few acritarchs, prasinophyte algae and chitinozoans occur in association: virtually no spores or cryptospores were recorded. Thick-walled prasinophytes are most numerous in this part of the Tanezzuft Formation in both the Ghadames and Murzuq basins, suggesting enhanced surface water productivity. Deposition took place after the melting of the Late Ordovician ice sheets, which led to a major marine transgression. The palynofacies recorded from the overlying 'Cold Shale' deposits indicate deposition in distal shelf and basin conditions that were also relatively anoxic. They contain more palynomorphs, especially acritarchs, and generally less AOM. The phytoplankton assemblages are dominated by simple and thin-walled prasinophyte algae (leiospheres), suggesting dysoxic-anoxic conditions. Overall the middle and the upper parts of the Tanezzuft Formation are regarded as being deposited in distal dysoxic-anoxic shelf, distal dysoxic-oxic shelf and distal suboxic-anoxic basin respectively. Because chitinozoans are very rare, age determinations of the samples investigated are based mainly on acritarchs. The Hot Shale is dated as early-mid Rhuddanian (early Llandovery) whereas the rest of the formation is considered to late Rhuddanian-Telychian in age. As documented previously from other samples of the Tanezzuft Formation in both the Ghadames and Murzuq basins, the Hot Shale has a very high TOC content and excellent source potential for liquid hydrocarbons, whereas rest of the formation is less rich in organic matter with larger terrestrial and oxidized components and hence reduced potential for sourcing hydrocarbons (both oil and gas).

CO2 plume monitoring observations at Sleipner can be used to indicate an overall storage efficiency of around 5% of the pore volume, with approximately one tenth of this volume dissolved in the brine phase. These estimates are consistent with the fluid dynamics of CO2 injection in which a gravity dominated processes are expected to give efficiencies in the range of 1-6%.

The results of a multi-dimensional scaling analysis indicate that the diatom assemblage changes documented throughout the 40 year record could be explained by three variables: barium and hopanes concentrations, and Mississippi River nitrogen loading. The results of a canonical correspondence analysis demonstrated that these signals could be distinguished through correlations with specific diatom species. The abundance of Actinoptychus senarius, for example, was negatively correlated with barium and the Pseudo-nitzschia delicatissima complex was positively correlated with nitrogen loading. These results provide a proof-of-concept demonstration that diatom assemblages preserved in the sediments can be used to study the effects of petroleum extraction activities, and that these 'petroleum signals' may be distinguished from other significant influences such as nutrient loading.

However, knowledge of how the long-term presence of grazers affects soil carbon sequestration is limited. In this study, we estimated total accumulated organic carbon in soils of a back-barrier salt marsh and determined how this is affected by long-term grazing by both small and large grazers in relation to age of the ecosystem. In young marshes, where small grazers predominate, hare and geese have a limited effect on total accumulated organic carbon. In older, mature marshes, where large grazers predominate, cattle substantially enhanced carbon content in the marsh soil. We ascribe this to a shift in biomass distribution in the local vegetation towards the roots in combination with trampling effects on the soil chemistry. These large grazers thus act as ecosystem engineers: their known effect on soil compaction (based on a previous study) enhances anoxic conditions in the marsh soil, thereby reducing the oxygen available for organic carbon decomposition by the local microbial community. This study showed that the indirect effects of grazing can significantly enhance soil carbon storage through changing soil abiotic conditions. This process should be taken into account when estimating the role of ecosystems in reducing carbon dioxide concentration in the atmosphere. Ultimately, we propose a testable conceptual framework that includes 3 pathways by which grazers can alter carbon storage: (1) through above-ground biomass removal, (2) through alteration of biomass distribution towards the roots and/or (3) by changing soil abiotic conditions that affect decomposition.",,,,,,,,,39,1,0,0,31,0,42,,,0171-8630,1616-1599,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Groningen, Community & Conservat Ecol Grp, NL-9700 CC Groningen, NetherlandsUniv Antwerp, Ecosyst Management Res Grp, B-2610 Antwerp, BelgiumRoyal Netherlands Inst Sea Res NIOZ Yerseke, Spatial Ecol Grp, NL-4400 AC Yerseke, Netherlands",,,,2015-10-14,WOS:000363180900002,,

It was compiled by a National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Biological Review Team (BRT) in response to a petition filed by the Center for Biological Diversity to list the spotted seal as threatened or endangered under the U.S. Endangered Species Act (ESA) (16 U.S.C. 1531 et seq.), primarily due to concern about threats to this species' habitat from climate warming and loss of sea ice. There are two key tasks associated with conducting an ESA status review: The first is to delineate the taxonomic group under consideration; the second is to conduct an extinction risk assessment for support of a determination of whether the species is threatened or endangered. The ESA defines the term endangered species as any species which is in danger of extinction throughout all or a significant portion of its range. The term threatened species is defined as any species which is likely to become an endangered species within the foreseeable future throughout all or a significant portion of its range. The BRT considered the time frames over which threats to spotted seals [long dash] and their response to those threats [long dash] are foreseeable, and concluded that there is no scientific basis for a single time frame that defines the foreseeable future. The threats of primary concern, stemming from rising greenhouse gas (GHG) concentrations and the associated warming climate, have been projected from climate models for the 21st century and were thus evaluated over that time frame. The scientific literature as well as recent, yet-to-be published research results were reviewed and summarized to support the extinction risk assessment of this rather poorly understood species. Species Background: The spotted seal is a member of the pinniped family Phocidae that is similar in appearance to its close relative, the widely-distributed harbor seal (Phoca vitulina). Spotted seals breed in the Yellow Sea, Sea of Japan, Sea of Okhotsk, and Bering Sea. This species is primarily associated with sea ice during its whelping, nursing, mating, and pelage molt periods, though in some places these functions take place on shore. These functions occur earliest (January-April) in the Yellow Sea, and latest (April-June) in the Bering Sea. Most spotted seals spend the rest of the year making periodic foraging trips from haul-out sites ashore or on sea ice. The vital rates of survival and reproduction are not well known. Both sexes usually reach maturity at about 4-5 years of age, and most mature females give birth to a single pup annually. Spotted seals may live to 30-35 years of age. They consume a broad variety of mostly fishes and some crustaceans and cephalopods, taken from waters over the continental shelves and shelf breaks. Species Delineation: Eight main areas of spotted seal breeding have been reported. On the basis of small samples and preliminary analyses of genetic composition, potential geographic barriers, and significance of breeding groups, the species was divided into three Distinct Population Segments (DPSs): The Bering DPS; the Okhotsk DPS; and the Southern DPS, which is composed of the spotted seals breeding in the Yellow Sea and Peter the Great Bay in the Sea of Japan. These were considered separately whenever there was sufficient information to assess the risks specific to each DPS. Extinction Risk Assessment: To assess the extinction risk, the BRT evaluated the specific threats faced by the species, as outlined in Section 4(a)(1) of the ESA: * the present or threatened destruction, modification, or curtailment of its habitat or range, * overutilization for commercial, recreational, scientific, or educational purposes, * disease or predation, * the inadequacy of existing regulatory mechanisms, or * other natural or manmade factors affecting its continued existence The risks posed by these threats were then assessed in terms of their implications for demographic factors, such as abundance, productivity, spatial structure, and diversity. Present or threatened destruction, modification, or curtailment of the species' habitat or range: The main concern about the conservation status of spotted seals stems from the likelihood that their sea-ice habitat has been modified by the warming climate and, more so, that the scientific consensus projections are for continued and perhaps accelerated warming in the foreseeable future. A second major concern, related by the common driver of carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions, is the modification of habitat by ocean acidification, which may alter prey populations and other important aspects of the marine ecosystem. A reliable assessment of the future conservation status of each spotted seal DPS requires a focus on projections of specific regional conditions, especially sea ice. In contrast to the Arctic Ocean, where sea ice is present year-round, the ice in the sub-Arctic seas of the spotted seal breeding range is seasonal in nature. Despite the recent dramatic reductions in Arctic Ocean ice extent during summer, the sea ice in the Bering Sea is expected to continue forming annually in winter for the foreseeable future, based on consensus (but still highly uncertain) projections through the 21st century. The sea-ice regime will continue to be subject to large interannual variations in extent and seasonal duration, as it has throughout recorded history. There will likely be more frequent years in which ice coverage is reduced, resulting in a decline in the long-term average ice extent, but Bering Sea spotted seals will likely continue to encounter sufficient ice to support adequate vital rates. Even if sea ice were to vanish completely from the Bering Sea, there may be prospects for spotted seals to adjust their breeding grounds to follow the northward shift of the annual ice front into the Chukchi Sea. For the Sea of Okhotsk, Sea of Japan, and Yellow Sea, current global climate models for sea ice do not perform satisfactorily. Inference about future ice conditions in these areas was drawn indirectly from projections of air or sea surface temperatures, and thus has even greater uncertainty than the projections for the Bering Sea. All three regions are likely to experience sufficient warming by the latter half of the 21st century that ice conditions will be significantly compromised in extent or duration during the important months for spotted seal pup suckling and pup maturation. In the Southern DPS, this may already occur on a regular basis, as much of the breeding now takes place ashore on rocks and small islands. There is no prospect in the Okhotsk or Southern DPS for long-term shifts of the breeding range into the Arctic Ocean because these areas have no northern marine connectivity to the Arctic. Ocean acidification, a result of increased carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, may impact spotted seal survival and recruitment through disruption of trophic regimes that are dependent on calcifying organisms. The nature and timing of such impacts are extremely uncertain. Because of spotted seals' apparent dietary flexibility, this threat should be of less immediate concern than the direct effects of sea-ice degradation. Changes in spotted seal prey, anticipated in response to ocean warming and loss of sea ice, have the potential for negative impacts, but the possibilities are complex. Some changes already documented in the Bering Sea and the North Atlantic Ocean are of a nature that could be ameliorative or beneficial to spotted seals. For example, several fish species, including walleye pollock (Theragra chalcogramma), a common spotted seal prey, have shown northward distribution shifts and increased recruitment in response to warming, at least initially. These ecosystem responses may have very long lags as they propagate through trophic webs. Apparent flexibility in spotted seal foraging locations and habits may make these threats of lower concern than more direct impacts from changes in sea ice. Overutilization for commercial, subsistence, recreational, scientific, or educational purposes: Recreational, scientific, and educational utilization of spotted seals is currently at low levels and is not projected to increase to significant threat levels in the foreseeable future for any of the DPSs. Commercial harvests by Soviet sealers were at moderate levels from the mid-1950s to the early 1990s. Russia has established harvest quotas in recent years but no significant numbers have been taken because of poor economic viability of the hunt. Subsistence harvest levels have been moderate historically in both the Bering and Okhotsk DPS but are not anticipated to increase significantly. Diseases, parasites, and predation: A variety of pathogens (or antibodies), diseases, helminthes, cestodes, and nematodes, have been found in spotted seals. The prevalence of these agents is not unusual among seals, but the population impact is unknown. There may be an increased risk of outbreaks of novel pathogens or parasites as climate-related shifts in species distributions lead to new modes of transmission. There is little or no direct evidence of significant predation on spotted seals and they are not thought to be a primary prey of any predators. Polar bears (Ursus maritimus) and killer whales (Orcinus orca) may be the most likely opportunistic predators in the current sea-ice regime, but walruses (Odobenus rosmarus) could pose a potentially greater risk if reduced sea-ice conditions force these pagophilic species into closer proximity in the future. Also predation risk could increase if loss of sea ice requires spotted seals to spend more time in the water or more time ashore. Inadequacy of existing regulatory mechanisms: There are currently no effective mechanisms to regulate GHG emissions domestically or internationally. The BRT did not attempt to separate the risk posed by the lack of a regulatory mechanism for GHG emissions from the risks posed by the effects of the emissions. The risks posed by future GHG emissions, via potential destruction or modification of spotted seal habitat, were assessed as described above by evaluating the best available projections of future conditions under scenarios of no regulation of GHGs (the projections were based on non- mitigated scenarios for future emissions). Therefore, the implications of the current lack of regulations are already included in the evaluation of risks to spotted seal habitat in the three DPSs. The inadequacy of existing regulatory mechanisms poses no additional threat to any of the spotted seal DPSs. In other words, while there are no regulatory mechanisms that effectively address reductions in sea ice habitat or ocean acidification, we do not expect this shortcoming to result in population-level impacts beyond those already identified in the section on present or threatened destruction of habitat. Inadequacy or lack of stringency of mechanisms to regulate oil and gas activities in the Yellow Sea and Sea of Okhotsk could contribute to the cumulative risk faced by the Southern and Okhotsk DPSs. Other natural or human factors affecting the species' continued existence: Risks could be significant to the Southern and Okhotsk DPSs from petroleum exploration, development, and production activities because these activities are already underway in those areas. Potentially significant interactions with commercial fisheries may pose significant risks, as well. Conclusions: Bering DPS: The primary threats faced by spotted seals in the Bering Sea are likely to be climate-related changes to the sea-ice habitat and to the prey community. Sea ice is expected to decline such that the average extent in May, during the latter half of the period for nursing and initial independent development of pups, is limited to areas north of St. Lawrence Island by about the middle of the 21st century. There will, however, likely continue to be large interannual variations of nearly the same magnitude as in the past, so that some years will have very extensive ice and others will have very low ice extent. The low ice years, which will come more frequently than in the past, may have impacts on recruitment, primarily through pup survival. On the other hand, some aspects of reduced ice may be beneficial to spotted seals, mitigating the impacts of low ice years. This is possible because of the prospect that thinner and more broken ice is likely to occur over large areas of the northern Bering Sea and Chukchi Sea that are currently too densely covered to be suitable for spotted seal breeding. The impacts of ocean acidification, the other significant climate-related threat to spotted seals, are even less predictable than the impacts of sea-ice reduction. Spotted seals, like other ice-associated species, are adapted for coping with large ranges of variability in conditions. There is currently no quantitative basis for determining whether the climate-related habitat impacts will outweigh the mitigating factors. No other threats were thought to pose significant demographic risks to the Bering DPS. A large population (at least 100,000) has persisted over the past several decades with no conspicuous extreme fluctuations. The suite of risks from overutilization, disease and predation, inadequacy of regulatory mechanisms, and other natural or human factors is not anticipated to change sufficiently to place the Bering DPS at risk of extinction within the foreseeable future. Okhotsk DPS: The threats faced by spotted seals in the Sea of Okhotsk are the same as to those in the Bering Sea, but the projections of future climate-related habitat conditions are less certain. In consideration of observed climatology and projected air temperatures, much of the region may have ice-deteriorating conditions in April by the mid-21st century. This region is characterized by some differences from the Bering Sea that may be significant to the status of spotted seals. The ice-covered area is smaller in the Sea of Okhotsk and there is no marine connection to the Arctic Ocean, unlike in the Bering Sea. Over the very long term, spotted seals in the Sea of Okhotsk do not have the prospect of following a retreating ice front northward into the Arctic, as Bering Sea spotted seals would. There is xiii currently no basis to judge whether ocean acidification will be any more severe or rapid in the Sea of Okhotsk than in other parts of the North Pacific, so the impact from that threat is no more predictable than for the other spotted seal DPSs. Although most of the other risks are expected to be similarly low between the Bering and Okhotsk DPSs, the risks associated with petroleum exploration, development, and production are likely to be significantly greater in the Okhotsk DPS. Oil production and further development in the Sea of Okhotsk are well underway and likely to be less stringently regulated than similar activities that are as yet only proposed for the Bering and Chukchi Seas (at least in U.S. waters). Commercial fishery interactions, either direct or indirect, also may pose a significant risk in the Okhotsk DPS. Together, these risks and the climate-related risks summarized above could have substantial cumulative effects. The demographic status of the Okhotsk DPS is less certain than the Bering DPS, but large numbers (as high as 268,000) of spotted seals were reported in the late-1960s to 1990. No conspicuous extreme changes are known to have occurred more recently. Even if the population was typically overestimated by a factor of 2, there would likely be approximately 100,000 spotted seals currently in the Okhotsk DPS, so that demographic and genetic risks from low abundance should not be a significant concern. Southern DPS: Although there is great uncertainty in projecting sea-ice conditions for the Yellow Sea andSea of Japan, sea-ice formation in the recent past has already been greatly reduced, and indirect evidence from air and sea surface temperature modeling suggests that seasonal ice will rarely form in these areas by about the middle of the 21st century. The species appears to have some capability to accomplish breeding and molting on shore when ice is not available. However, pinnipeds are generally not well protected from predation when they are constrained by the necessity of maintaining a mother- pup bond; that is, when escape to the water may disrupt the bond or poses thermoregulation problems for the pup. Therefore, suitable space for spotted seals to breed on land is likely limited to offshore rocks and small islands without human habitation, which are relatively scarce in the Southern DPS. The dire status of spotted seals in the Southern DPS is likely to be maintained or worsened by the cumulative effects of: poaching for genitalia and culling by fisherman; loss of sea-ice habitat; breeding and molting in a non-preferred and possibly scarce habitat (ashore vs. on ice); reduced prey populations (e.g., pollock in the Sea of Japan and herring in the Yellow Sea); possible prey community disruption from ocean warming and acidification; and oil and gas development activities. The population sizes are already significantly reduced from historical levels, and if reduced further they may begin to be at significant risk from small-population threats such as demographic stochasticity and genetic problems. The small sizes of these populations, as well ecologically unique characteristics associated with life at the southern extremity of the species' range, have been recognized by China, South Korea, and Russia through designation of special conservation status on the seals and portions of their habitat, though the effectiveness of these measures for preventing extinction is uncertain.",,,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Alaska Fisheries Science Center, 7600 Sand Point Way NE, Seattle, WA 98115, USA",,,,2009-10-01,ZOOREC:ZOOR14602014313,,

The threat of climate change, fossil fuel depletion and the growing world energy demand ask for a more sustainable way of electricity production, eg, by using renewable energy sources, by improving the conversion efficiency and/or by controlling power plant emissions. Despite the relationship between exergy and sustainability stated in literature, exergy losses are usually not considered when comparing systems and energy sources for power generation. The exergetic sustainability assessment method named Total Cumulative Exergy Loss (TCExL) has been used to assess several systems for electricity production, ie, a coal-fired power plant, a coal-fired power plant including carbon capture and storage, a biomass-fired power plant, an offshore wind farm and a photovoltaic park. The results of the TCExL method have been compared with an environmental sustainability indicator, ie, the overall ReCiPe endpoint indicator and the economic indicator named Present Worth Ratio. The offshore wind farm is the best system from the exergetic and environmental point of view. The photovoltaic park is the system with the second-best scores. However, from the economic viewpoint including subsidy by the Dutch government, the photovoltaic park performs better than the wind farm system and the system that performs best is the biomass-fired power plant. Without subsidy, only the coal-fired power plant without carbon capture and storage is profitable. The exergetic sustainability scores of the coal-fired and biomass-fired power plants are similar, but from the environmental sustainability viewpoint, the biomass-fired power plant performs better than both coal-fired power plants. As the results of environmental and economic sustainability assessments strongly depend on models, weighting factors, subsidy, market prices, etc, while the results of the exergetic sustainability assessment do not, it is recommended that the exergetic sustainability be taken into account when assessing the sustainability of power generation and other technological systems.",,,,,"9th International Exergy, Energy and Environment Symposium (IEEES)9th International Exergy, Energy and Environment Symposium (IEEES)","MAY 14-17, 2017MAY 14-17, 2017",,"Split, CROATIASplit, CROATIA",49,1,0,0,2,0,53,,,0363-907X,1099-114X,,,,,,,,,,"Delft Univ Technol, Fac Technol Policy & Management, Dept Engn Syst & Serv, POB 5015, NL-2600GA Delft, NetherlandsUniv Padua, Dept Ind Engn, Via Venezia 1, I-35131 Padua, ItalyDelft Univ Technol, Fac Civil Engn & Geosci, Dept Geosci & Engn, POB 5048, NL-2600GA Delft, Netherlands",,,,2018-07-13,WOS:000435786800005,,

Therefore, it is of great significance to monitor the marine environment and offshore platforms. The self-contained sensor for deep-sea offshore platform with its unique design, can not only effectively extend the working time of the sensor with the capability of converting vibration energy to electrical energy, but also simultaneously collect the data of acceleration, inclination, temperature and humidity of the deep sea, so that we can achieve the purpose of monitoring offshore platforms through analyzing the collected data.The self-contained sensor for monitoring of deep-sea offshore platform includes sensing unit, data collecting and storage unit, the energy supply unit. The sensing unit with multi-variables, consists of an accelerometer LIS344ALH, an inclinometer SCA103T and a temperature and humidity sensor SHT11; the data collecting and storage unit includes the MSP430 low-power MCU, large capacity memory, clock circuit and the communication interface, the communication interface includes USB interface, serial ports and wireless interface; in addition, the energy supply unit, converting vibration to electrical energy to power the overall system, includes the electromagnetic generator, voltage multiplier circuit and a super capacitor which can withstand virtually unlimited number of charge-discharge cycles. When the seawater impacts on offshore platforms to produce vibration, electromagnetic generator converts vibration to electrical energy, its output(similar to 1 V 50 Hz AC) is stepped up and rectified by a voltage multiplier circuit, and the energy is stored in a super capacitor. It is controlled by the MSP430 that monitors the voltage level on the super capacitor. The super capacitor charges the Li-ion battery when the voltage on the super capacitor reaches a threshold, then the whole process of energy supply is completed. The self-contained sensor for deep-sea offshore platform has good application prospects and practical value with small size, low power, being easy to install, converting vibration energy to supply power and high detection accuracy.",,,,,"Conference on Sensors and Smart Structures Technologies for Civil, Mechanical, and Aerospace SystemsConference on Sensors and Smart Structures Technologies for Civil, Mechanical, and Aerospace Systems","MAR 10-14, 2013MAR 10-14, 2013",SPIE; Amer Soc Mech EngineersSPIE; Amer Soc Mech Engineers,"San Diego, CASan Diego, CA",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,0277-786X,1996-756X,978-0-8194-9475-7,,,,,,,,,"Dalian Univ Technol, Sch Elect Sci & Technol, Dalian 116024, Peoples R China",,,,2013-09-18,WOS:000323283300116,,

The formation of calcium carbonate and its burial in marine sediments accounts for around 80% of the total carbon removed from the Earth's surface. However, the fraction of calcium carbonate that precipitates in the oceans, versus that which precipitates authigenically in marine sediments, is unclear. Here, we compile measurements of the calcium concentration of pore fluids collected at 672 seafloor sites around the globe to calculate the global flux of calcium within marine sediments. We use these data, combined with alkalinity measurements of pore fluids, to quantify authigenic calcium carbonate precipitation. We estimate that the net calcium flux into marine sediments that can be ascribed to authigenic carbonate precipitation amounts to around 1 x 10(12) mol yr(-1). As such, we estimate that authigenic carbonate precipitation accounts for at least 10% of global carbonate accumulation. We show that much of the precipitation occurs along the eastern margins of ocean basins, where organic matter delivery to the sea floor is likely to be high. We suggest that authigenic calcium carbonate precipitation represents a non-negligible component of the global carbon cycle.",,,,,,,,,101,13,2,0,27,0,126,,,1752-0894,1752-0908,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Cambridge, Dept Earth Sci, Cambridge CB2 3EQ, England",,,,2014-04-02,WOS:000332088800015,,

Research to date has documented a dynamic oceanographic mosaic in the inner shelf of the California Current System (CCS) that spans 1,200+ km and varies at tidal, diurnal, event, and seasonal temporal scales at local to ocean basin spatial scales. In OMEGAS II, the project seeks to better understand the drivers of this striking time-space variability, and to link the OA seascape to the physiological and ecological performance of a key member of this ecosystem, the mussel Mytilus californianus. In addition, the investigators will explore the influence of this oceanographic mosaic on species interactions and community organization. As a dominant habitat-forming species, strong interactor, and major space occupant, M. californianus is arguably the core component of the rocky intertidal ecosystem along the upwelling-dominated CCS. Using an interdisciplinary, spatially extensive approach integrating inner shelf oceanography with ecology, physiology, and eco-mechanics, the interdisciplinary team will study the response of juvenile mussels M. californianus to OA. The studies span levels of biological organization, thereby allowing assessment of how the cost of forming a shell under field conditions might influence physiological performance and resistance to predation. This investigation will include modeling to link to larger-scale ecosystem and oceanographic dynamics in the CCS and beyond. Results from OMEGAS I show that the growth, survival, and shell strength of mussel larvae are strongly negatively affected by elevated pCO2, and that growth of adult mussels varied among sites within regions and between regions. Emerging data on natural variability in seawater conditions will allow a deeper exploration of the organismal response of M. californianus, and the ecological consequences of traits, such as reduced shell thickness and strength. The present project will expand and strengthen the existing oceanographic network to increase our understanding of the coastal OA regime, and provide the environmental context for ecological and physiological research. Specifically, this project will (1) conduct field and laboratory experiments on the influence of OA on the growth, shell accretion, and resistance to predation of juvenile mussels collected from 10 sites spanning 1,400 km of coastline, (2) link the OA-sensor oceanographic backbone to an existing database of community structure via ecological modeling to assess the influence of OA on coastal variation in community organization, (3) determine the physiological responses of juvenile mussels following field deployments and culture under common garden conditions to evaluate mechanistic underpinnings to the responses observed in mussels from different sites, (4) explore the physiological and transcriptomic response of mussels in lab mesocosms to field-documented variability in pCO2, and (5) using modified ROMS models, evaluate the linkage between basin-scale oceanography and local-scale variation in inner-shelf oceanography to evaluate the relative influences of large-to-local scale factors on OA variability.

The tool will be supported through an internally constructed web mapping service, allowing the outputs to be integrated into BP's oil and gas standard Common Operating Picture (COP) and Marine Scotland's National Marine Plan Interactive (NMPi).Informative data layers will provide the oil and gas sector with a unique capability to access and utilise the UK's oceanographic data sets. The ability to integrate the layers into the oil and gas sector COP system will significantly increase effectiveness and impact from the project. As an outcome, the sector will be able to enhance their existing operations by basing future environmental management decisions on the best available information. The NMPi is a well-established and publicly accessible marine planning system. It is crucial that the NMPi is continually updating its content to ensure that it remains an effective public service. ODaT will broaden the NMPi content, providing an informative GIS layer based on the outputs of NERC oceanographic science programmes. This will significantly enhance the service, benefiting a wide range of marine stakeholders.Working with BP and Marine scotland, ODaT will support the key deliverables of broader ocean observation collaborations and working groups.

Historically, the Korea-Japan Joint Development Agreement('JDA') was established in 1974 after an attempt to make a joint development agreement among Korea, Taiwan, and Japan had failed, due to political environments such as China's strong objection and complicated political relationships among Korea, China, Japan, and Taiwan. However, it seems that discussion about multinational joint development agreement is necessary for Korea, China, and Japan in the future for the following reasons: Japan has lukewarm attitude for joint development with Korea; the Korea-Japan JDA might expire in 2028; China has continuously disapproved the Korea-Japan JDA and its joint development zone; and there is the overlapping claim zone of continental shelf among the three countries in the East China Sea. Furthermore, under the international current situation in which international rule of maritime delimitation is basically based on the mutual consent between relevant countries, the fact that no country in the East China Sea want to give up or convey sovereign rights of its continental shelf shows that another joint development agreement is more likely to be discussed.In this regard, the purposes of this article are to prospect three joint development models for the overlapping claim zone of continental shelf among Korea, China, and Japan, and to induct Korean government into the vehicle for a tripartite joint development agreement in the future.For these purposes, this paper will address as follows: section Ⅱ analyzes the Korea-Japan JDA and three countries' declarations and municipal laws concerning their continental shelf, and section Ⅲ prospects three future joint development models applicable to the overlapping claim zone of continental shelf among Korea, China, and Japan in the East China Sea.

Understanding how penguins use marine habitats around the Falkland islands is critical to reducing conflicts with human activities. We present satellite tracking data that show how three species of penguins breeding at New Island use the marine environment. This information can be used to prevent and reduce negative impacts of development.2. Gentoo penguins foraged very close (<10 km) to the breeding colony, magellanic penguins foraged at intermediate distances (10-90 km) and rockhopper penguins foraged both very close (<10 km) and at great (>100 km) distances. Rockhoppers foraged in and/or travelled through an area designated for oil and gas development.3. The patterns of penguin use of the Falkland Islands marine environment indicate that conflicts between penguins and humans are likely. Because of the large area penguins use, marine zoning (regulating location and timing of human activities over large areas of the marine environment) will be required to minimize these conflicts. Localized marine reserves near colonies may effectively protect gentoo penguins, but will be inadequate to protect other penguin species.4. The precautionary principle should be incorporated into future plans for fisheries that target penguin prey species such as crustaceans or baitfish and for development of petroleum extraction and transport. Given the dynamic nature of the marine environment, continued satellite tracking of penguins will be essential for an effective conservation programme.

The stomach content analysis of nine key fish species (including Sebastes schlegelii, Hexagrammos otakii, Hexagrammos agrammus, Sebastiscus mamoratus, Lateolabrax maculatus, etc.), were conducted to examine the food webs in artificial reef zone. The results showed that the diet of C. myriaster consisted of more than 30 species belonging to seven orders, in which shrimps were the most dominant prey species, followed by fishes and cephalopods. The domi. nant species in the diet of C. myriaster were H. otakii, Enedrias fangi, Trachypenaeus curvirostris, Ammodytes personatus and Alpheus japonicas. The diet composition of C. myriaster varied with season and anal length. Fishes and shrimps were the two important groups throughout the years. Cephalo. pods were predominant in spring. Cephalopods and crabs were predominant in Autumn. Fish eggs were eaten mostly during winter. Fish eggs and T. curvirostris were the dominant prey groups of the C. myriaster with anal length <= 120 mm, whereas A. personatus and A. japonicas were the dominant prey groups of the C. myriaster with anal length 120-130 mm, H. otakii and E. fangi were the dominant prey of the C. myriaster with anal length > 130 mm. The percentage of empty stomach of C. myriaster varied significantly with season, but the mean stomach fullness index did not.

It is 1,000 km by 350 km and is filled with up to 13 km of Carboniferous to Paleogene strata. The basin initially developed in Early Carboniferous as a rift basin upon highly deformed Early Paleozoic strata of the Ellesmerian Orogenic Belt. The development of the basin can be broken into eight phases, each being characterized by a distinctive combination of tectonic, depositional and climatic regimes and separated by episodes of widespread uplift and basin reorganization.The Upper Paleozoic strata are up to 5 km thick and are characterized by a distinct shelf to deep basin topography. Carbonate strata dominated the shelf until Middle Permian and were supplanted by siliciclastics and chert in Middle and Late Permian when the climate cooled. Triassic siliciclastics are up to 4 km thick and they filled the deep, central basin by Late Triassic.From latest Triassic to earliest Cretaceous the basin was occupied by shallow siliciclastics shelves and up to 2 km of strata accumulated. Renewed rifting in Early Cretaceous resulted in a thick succession (2 km) of Early Cretaceous non-marine to shallow marine strata with units of basalts in the northeast. Widespread diabase sill and dyke intrusion, likely related to the Alpha Ridge Plume and the opening of the Amerasia Ocean Basin, occurred at this time. Following an interval of low subsidence and low sediment supply in the Late Cretaceous, the basin began to be deformed in earliest Paleocene by the Eurekan Orogeny driven by the counterclockwise rotation of Greenland. Local foreland basins developed and contain up to 3 km of Paleocene-Eocene strata. In Late Eocene the basin was uplifted and deformed by faulting and folding with deformation decreasing southwestwards.Eighteen oil and gas fields have been discovered in Eurekan anticlines and potential prospects include traps associated with Eurekan structures, salt domes, reefs and prominent unconformities. Widespread petroleum source rocks are documented in Middle and Upper Triassic strata and likely occur with other stratigraphic intervals from Carboniferous to Lower Cretaceous.",,,,,,,,,110,1,1,0,12,0,123,,,1874-5997,,978-0-08-092936-1; 978-0-44-450425-8,,,,,,,,,"Geol Survey Canada, Inst Sedimentary & Petr Geol, Calgary, AB T2L 2A7, CanadaUniv Calgary, Arctic Inst N Amer, Calgary, AB, Canada",,,,2008-01-01,WOS:000310791100014,,

The Deepwater Horizon spill resulted in chronic, multi-year re-oiling and up to 4 yr of extensive and often intensive treatments. Of the 965 km of sand beaches that were oiled, shoreline treatment was documented on 683 km. Intensive mechanical treatment was conducted from 9 to 45 mo after the initial oiling on 32.4 km of shoreline in Louisiana, and deep beach excavation/sifting and tilling was conducted along 60.5 km in Louisiana, Alabama, and Florida, often along contiguous lengths of beach. Recovery of sand beach invertebrate communities from the combined effects of oiling and treatment would likely be delayed by 2 to 6 yr after the last response action was completed. We introduce the concept of 'Response Injury' categories that reflect both intensity and frequency of beach treatment methods. We use the literature on similar types of disturbances to sand beach communities (foot traffic, vehicular traffic, wrack removal, beach nourishment) to describe the expected impacts. Temporal patterns of response-related disturbances can affect seasonal recruitment of organisms and the overall rate of ecosystem recovery from both oil exposure and treatment disturbance. This concept provides a framework for specifically assessing response-related impacts in future spills, which has not been considered in previous injury assessments.",,,,,,,,,11,0,0,0,9,0,11,,,0171-8630,1616-1599,,,,,,,,,,"Res Planning Inc, Columbia, SC 29201 USAUniv North Carolina Chapel Hill, Inst Marine Sci, Morehead City, NC 28557 USAUS Fish & Wildlife Serv, Houston, TX 77058 USA",Res Planning Inc,,,2017-09-12,WOS:000407443900016,,

To mitigate the effect of CO2 on the climate change and global warming, Korea should reduce the anthropogenic CO2 emissions from sources such as power plants and iron works. CO2 Capture and Storage (CCS) technology is regarded as one of the most promising carbon reduction options. The demonstration project of CCS is funded by the Korean government to demonstrate the capture, transportation and storage of 1 Mt CO2 per year in Korea by 2020. This study established the CO2 transport strategies from the sources to sinks for the CCS demonstration in Korea. Also the cost estimations were carried out with the CO2 transport strategies. The CO2 transport methods suggested in this study are the pipelines for both onshore and offshore, and a ship-based concept consisting of a pipeline from the source to coastal terminal (including the liquefaction facility on a barge) and a CO2 carrier from the terminal to sink (including the temporary storage near offshore sink). Although the present study is now on-going to optimize the CO2 transport infrastructure for the offshore CCS in Korea, the preliminary results show the CO2 transport cost for the pipeline system is lower than that for the shipping in the present status. The result is meaningful only for the specific source and storage sites studied in this study. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

According, the working temperature and pressure intensity of subsea oil and gas pipelines have increased by a considerable degree. This situation is accompanied by the global buckling problem in deep sea pipelines, which has become increasingly common. Meanwhile, ordinary single-layer pipelines cannot last for a long time under harsh deep-sea working conditions. Thus, multilayer pipelines, such as the pipe-in-pipe (PIP) structure and bundled pipelines, have gradually become top choices. However, the global buckling mechanisms of these multilayer pipelines are more complicated than those of single-layer pipelines. The sleeper-snake lay pipeline, which is an active control method for global buckling, was used in this study. The change and development laws of global buckling in a PIP structure at different wavelengths and amplitudes were determined through an experimental study. A dynamic solution method that considers artificial damping was adopted to establish finite element global buckling models of a PIP structure with initial imperfections. The effects of various factors, such as pipeline laying shape, sleeper-pipe function, and seabed-pipe function, on global buckling were analyzed. By the result of finite element method analysis, the initial imperfection, and sleeper-pipeline friction were determined to be the key factors that influenced critical pipeline buckling force.

However, given increasing societal concern over fossil fuel energy, could CO2-EOR unintentionally hinder conventional CCS by reducing support from neutral or cautiously supportive voices? This paper assesses how stakeholders and citizens respond to four scenarios for CCS with CO2-EOR in the North Sea, and draws societal implications for deployment in other mature basins. Based on focus group data from Aberdeen, Edinburgh and London, we argue that scenarios emphasising maximising oil recovery may be met with scepticism or even opposition, and that there is an expectation for national governments to lead and ensure CO2-EOR (and CCS more generally) are undertaken in the public interest. Nonetheless, our data also suggest a certain degree of pragmatism as to the embeddedness of fossil fuels in society, and thus that there may be qualified support for CCS with CO2-EOR as making best use of existing fields whilst decarbonising the power and industrial sectors. However, for this support to emerge there is an imperative for coherent and credible policy that positions CO2-EOR firmly within a managed transition towards a low-carbon economy.

Research to date has documented a dynamic oceanographic mosaic in the inner shelf of the California Current System (CCS) that spans 1,200+ km and varies at tidal, diurnal, event, and seasonal temporal scales at local to ocean basin spatial scales. In OMEGAS II, the project seeks to better understand the drivers of this striking time-space variability, and to link the OA seascape to the physiological and ecological performance of a key member of this ecosystem, the mussel Mytilus californianus. In addition, the investigators will explore the influence of this oceanographic mosaic on species interactions and community organization. As a dominant habitat-forming species, strong interactor, and major space occupant, M. californianus is arguably the core component of the rocky intertidal ecosystem along the upwelling-dominated CCS. Using an interdisciplinary, spatially extensive approach integrating inner shelf oceanography with ecology, physiology, and eco-mechanics, the interdisciplinary team will study the response of juvenile mussels M. californianus to OA. The studies span levels of biological organization, thereby allowing assessment of how the cost of forming a shell under field conditions might influence physiological performance and resistance to predation. This investigation will include modeling to link to larger-scale ecosystem and oceanographic dynamics in the CCS and beyond. Results from OMEGAS I show that the growth, survival, and shell strength of mussel larvae are strongly negatively affected by elevated pCO2, and that growth of adult mussels varied among sites within regions and between regions. Emerging data on natural variability in seawater conditions will allow a deeper exploration of the organismal response of M. californianus, and the ecological consequences of traits, such as reduced shell thickness and strength. The present project will expand and strengthen the existing oceanographic network to increase our understanding of the coastal OA regime, and provide the environmental context for ecological and physiological research. Specifically, this project will (1) conduct field and laboratory experiments on the influence of OA on the growth, shell accretion, and resistance to predation of juvenile mussels collected from 10 sites spanning 1,400 km of coastline, (2) link the OA-sensor oceanographic backbone to an existing database of community structure via ecological modeling to assess the influence of OA on coastal variation in community organization, (3) determine the physiological responses of juvenile mussels following field deployments and culture under common garden conditions to evaluate mechanistic underpinnings to the responses observed in mussels from different sites, (4) explore the physiological and transcriptomic response of mussels in lab mesocosms to field-documented variability in pCO2, and (5) using modified ROMS models, evaluate the linkage between basin-scale oceanography and local-scale variation in inner-shelf oceanography to evaluate the relative influences of large-to-local scale factors on OA variability.

Research to date has documented a dynamic oceanographic mosaic in the inner shelf of the California Current System (CCS) that spans 1,200+ km and varies at tidal, diurnal, event, and seasonal temporal scales at local to ocean basin spatial scales. In OMEGAS II, the project seeks to better understand the drivers of this striking time-space variability, and to link the OA seascape to the physiological and ecological performance of a key member of this ecosystem, the mussel Mytilus californianus. In addition, the investigators will explore the influence of this oceanographic mosaic on species interactions and community organization. As a dominant habitat-forming species, strong interactor, and major space occupant, M. californianus is arguably the core component of the rocky intertidal ecosystem along the upwelling-dominated CCS. Using an interdisciplinary, spatially extensive approach integrating inner shelf oceanography with ecology, physiology, and eco-mechanics, the interdisciplinary team will study the response of juvenile mussels M. californianus to OA. The studies span levels of biological organization, thereby allowing assessment of how the cost of forming a shell under field conditions might influence physiological performance and resistance to predation. This investigation will include modeling to link to larger-scale ecosystem and oceanographic dynamics in the CCS and beyond. Results from OMEGAS I show that the growth, survival, and shell strength of mussel larvae are strongly negatively affected by elevated pCO2, and that growth of adult mussels varied among sites within regions and between regions. Emerging data on natural variability in seawater conditions will allow a deeper exploration of the organismal response of M. californianus, and the ecological consequences of traits, such as reduced shell thickness and strength. The present project will expand and strengthen the existing oceanographic network to increase our understanding of the coastal OA regime, and provide the environmental context for ecological and physiological research. Specifically, this project will (1) conduct field and laboratory experiments on the influence of OA on the growth, shell accretion, and resistance to predation of juvenile mussels collected from 10 sites spanning 1,400 km of coastline, (2) link the OA-sensor oceanographic backbone to an existing database of community structure via ecological modeling to assess the influence of OA on coastal variation in community organization, (3) determine the physiological responses of juvenile mussels following field deployments and culture under common garden conditions to evaluate mechanistic underpinnings to the responses observed in mussels from different sites, (4) explore the physiological and transcriptomic response of mussels in lab mesocosms to field-documented variability in pCO2, and (5) using modified ROMS models, evaluate the linkage between basin-scale oceanography and local-scale variation in inner-shelf oceanography to evaluate the relative influences of large-to-local scale factors on OA variability.

Traditional exploitation such as fisheries, tourism, transportation, and oil production are accompanied by new sustainable economic activities such as offshore windfarms, aquaculture, and tidal and wave energy. One proposed solution to overcome possible competing claims at sea lies in combining these economic activities as part of Multi-Use Platforms at Sea (MUPS). MUPS can be understood as areas at sea, designated for a combination of activities, either completely integrated in a platform or in shared marine space. MUPS can potentially benefit from each other in terms of infrastructure, maintenance, etc. Developing MUPS in the marine environment demands adequate governance. In this article, we investigate four European sites to find out how governance arrangements may facilitate or complicate MUPs. In particular, we apply a framework specifying policy, economic, social, technical, environmental, and legal (PESTEL) factors to explore governance arrangements in four case study sites in different sea basins around Europe ( the Mediterranean Sea, the Atlantic Ocean, the North Sea, and the Baltic Sea).

The O&G production in Egypt is distributed as follows: 70% from Gulf of Suez, 16% from Western desert, 8% from the Sinai Peninsula and 6% from Eastern desert. Past O&G activities, refining and transport have resulted in chronic pollution in Egyptian offshore and numerous environmental programs have been initiated to protect new development areas from the environmental impacts. The offshore drilling process uses drilling fluids (mud) and generates waste fluids and cuttings, which could be the largest discharges going into the receiving water bodies. There are several options to manage offshore drilling wastes: offshore discharge, offshore down-hole injection and onshore disposal. Water-based drilling fluids (WBF) are commonly employed for drilling in Egyptian offshore because of their expected environmental benign behavior. The main objective of this paper is to develop a methodology to determine the fate of heavy metals associated with WBF drilling waste in the marine environment and estimate the associated ecological risks. Proposed contaminant fate model is based on an aquivalence approach, which has been integrated with fuzzy-based analysis to study the uncertainties.

At the same time, eelgrass is threatened by direct destruction, pollution, and other human impacts on the environment. We know that genetic diversity in eelgrass enhances seagrass bed growth and persistence, but application of this knowledge to restoration and conservation is limited. This work will guide restoration programs by considering what specific aspects of diversity are important to conservation and restoration of seagrass ecosystems, helping to guide the selection of source material to improve restoration success (which is often low). The project integrates the effects of multiple components of diversity and clarifies the extent to which genetic and ecological uniqueness can predict ecosystem functions. Intellectual Merit: Genetic diversity as measured by the number of genetically distinct individuals (genets) in an assemblage influences critical ecosystem functions in a wide range of ecosystems. Functional diversity, the presence of key traits, or population flexibility to respond to environmental change are all potential mechanisms underlying these patterns, but distinguishing among them requires a clear link between genetic diversity and the phenotypes present in an assemblage. The investigators, and others, have previously demonstrated that genet diversity in eelgrass (Zostera marina) increases stand productivity, animal community diversity, and resilience to environmental change. These genet diversity effects are associated with increases in genetically determined trait diversity. Predicting trait diversity without having to measure traits of every genet remains a major barrier to wider application of functional diversity approaches in restoration and management. In this project, the investigators assess the association between Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) across the genome and performance-related traits that we will measure at the individual, population, and seascape-scale. They also assess environmental correlates of trait differentiation from field sampling. Finally, the research team will compare the predictive power of genomic SNP diversity versus other metrics of intraspecific diversity for the functioning (productivity, invertebrate abundance) of field planted eelgrass assemblages. If genomic variation can reliably be used to predict functional traits, then the value of genomic sequencing efforts for informing management will be greatly enhanced. Broader Impacts: Seagrass restoration and mitigation is currently of major interest in California and elsewhere and the project results will inform current initiatives regarding eelgrass management in California through the state's Ocean Protection Council. In addition to recruiting individual students from diverse backgrounds to work on the project, the project broadens participation of students in STEM fields through its partnership with three existing outreach/training programs at UC Davis.

The IPCC (2005) clearly indicated that installations of CCS technology require 'long-term management' by: ensuring careful site selection; monitoring systems; regulations; and remediation and liability measures. While a large volume of legal study on CCS has been undertaken, a variety of SEA and EIA and their possible mixed approaches are also being considered for designing an effective policy and legal framework for CCS (e.g. IEAGHG, 2007; and Koornneef et al. 2008, 2011). Yet, the best practice of the mixed approach to assisting a policy, legal and regulatory framework is unclear, due to the lack of experience and the varied levels of comprehension. Japan intends to commercialise CCS technology in the future. This paper provides an analysis of examining: whether the key roles and elements of SEA and EIA in response to long-term management are being covered in the current CCS law in Japan.

There are three steps of this method: the wave energy was transferred into marine current energy; electric power was generated from this current energy; and the artificial stony coral reef was created by the synthetic action of dissolved carbon dioxide and calcium ion under the promoting effect of low electric current in the seawater. In the process of creating stony coral reef, the carbon dioxide both in the atmosphere above sea surface and in the seawater was absorbed and sequestrated or semi sequestrated. This method was validated in indoor experiments under heavy polluted environmental conditions.

These habitats cover 2,161,446 ha and grow profusely in estuaries that occupy 38,000 km(2) to store substantial sedimentary organic carbon of 480.48 Tg C. New investigations around GoM for Mexican mangroves, Louisiana salt marshes and seagrasses motivated our integration of buried organic carbon to elucidate a new estimate of GoM blue carbon stocks. Factors creating this include: large GoM watersheds enriching carbon slowly flowing through shallow estuarine habitats with long residence times; fewer SE Mexican hurricanes allowing enhanced carbon storage; mangrove carbon productivity enhanced by warm southern basin winter temperatures; large Preservation reserves amongst high anthropogenic development. The dominant total GoM mangrove blue carbon stock 196.88 Tg from total mangrove extent 650,482 ha is highlighted from new Mexican data. Mexican mangrove organic carbon stock is 112.74 Tg (1st sediment meter) plus USA 84.14 Tg. Mexican mangroves vary greatly in storage, total carbon depositional depths and in sediment age (to 3500 y). We report Mexican mangrove's conservative storage fraction for the normally-compared top meter, whereas the full storage depth estimates ranging above 366.78 Tg (high productivity in very deep sediment along the central Veracruz/Tabasco coast) are not reflected in our reported estimates. Seagrasses stock of 184.1 Tg C organic is derived from 972,327 ha areal extent (in 1st meter). The Louisiana marshes form the heart of GoM salt marsh carbon storage 99.5 Tg (in 1st meter), followed by lesser stocks in Florida, Texas, finally Mexico derived from salt marsh extent totaling 650,482 ha. Constraints on the partial estuarine fluxes given for this new data are discussed as well as widespread anthropogenic destruction of the GoM blue carbon.

Besides, the engineering factors considered in research are top tension ratio and drilling vessel drift. In this paper, a finite element model is established by ANSYS to imitate the force condition of marine riser, so as to analyze the influence laws of top tension ratio and drilling vessel drift rate on marine riser stability (i.e. the corner and lateral force on bottom ball joint) in Beaufort force scale 3 and 8 windy conditions. The results show that the lateral force increases with the drilling vessel drift rate and top tension ratio accordingly by linear mode. For the same tension increasing extent, the greater the drilling vessel drifts, the more increasing range the lateral force appears. The corner on bottom ball joint has a linear relation with the drilling vessel drift rate similarly. However, the corner on the bottom ball joint demonstrates a non-linear decreasing method as fast followed by slow due to the increasing top tension ratio.

Sample collection was performed in April-July 2003, after the Prestige oil spill (November 2002), to determine whether the hydrocarbons released into the water column as a consequence of the spill were accumulated by the planktonic communities during the subsequent spring and early summer blooms. Surface sediments were also collected to assess the presence of the spilled oil, removed from the water column by downward particle transport.Plankton concentrations of PAHs (Sigma 14 parent components) were in the range of 25898 ng g(-1) dw, the highest values being close to coastal urban areas. However, the individual distributions were highly dominated by alkyl naphthalenes and phenanthrenes, paralleling those in the water dissolved fraction. The detailed study of petrogenic molecular markers (e.g. steranes and triterpanes, and methyl phenanthrenes and dibenzothiophenes) showed the occurrence of background petrogenic pollution but not related with the Prestige oil, with the possible exception of the station off Costa da Morte in May 2003, heavily oiled after the accident.The dominant northerly wind conditions during the spring and early summer 2003, which prevented the arrival of fresh oil spilled from the wreck, together with the heavy nature of the fuel oil, which was barely dispersed in seawater, and the large variability of planktonic cycles, could be the factors hiding the acute accumulation of the spilled hydrocarbons. Then, with the above exception, the concentrations of PAHs found in the collected samples, mostly deriving from chronic pollution, can be considered as the reference values for the region.

Crabs are then harvested for use as angling bait. C maenas are known to reside under crab-tiles during low tide, however the extent to which crab-tiles influence the distribution and behaviour of crabs and other estuarine fauna during high tide is not clear. To investigate this, fixed underwater video cameras were deployed on a mudflat over two separate occasions in control (non-tiled) and tiled sites. Crabs were significantly more abundant in crab-tiled sites than control sites, and they remained relatively stationary, travelling less in tiled sites than those in control sites.The abundance of mobile fauna (e.g. benthic gobies, mysids, crabs and pelagic fishes) was greater in control sites than in tiled sites during July. The same trend was observed in March but was not significant. Diversity (number of taxa) tended to be greater in control sites than tiled sites on both occasions, but the trend was not significant. The faunal assemblage was not different between control and tiled treatments in either March or July.Crabs occupied crab-tiles throughout high tide immersion, and qualitative observations indicated a tendency to aggressively defend particular tiles. It also seems likely that the tiles provided some protection for the crabs from fish and diving birds. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

The study was conducted to provide a marine ranching model to Nauru and to set up a fisheries cooperation. Nauru, a less developed country that relies heavily on seafood for food resources, has been experiencing a severe fiscal deficit. However, fisheries production has been declining due to the excessive exploitation of fisheries resources and a recent change in the ocean environment due to global warming. Under these circumstances, it is necessary to introduce a marine ranching system to Nauru, which can act as a means to increase fisheries resources by creating an artificial fishing ground and fisheries resources. Since the Nauru inhabits coral reefs with pelagic fishes migrating around its coast, a floating artificial reef marine ranching seems necessary for the area. Thus, by applying the Korean marine ranching system to Nauru, Nauru can expect positive results in the provision of seafood security as food resources through strengthening the base of fisheries production. This will also bring an increase in income for fishermen and facilitate the fishing community's regional economy. Therefore, in order to cooperate with Nauru in the fishery sector, the Korean government needs to set a priority on the marine ranching project with regards to the ODA project in South Pacific Islands. It is also necessary to diversify ODA projects in fishing areas such as creating fishing grounds, creating fisheries resources and marine ranching for Pacific Islands, which will lead to a fruitful result.",,,,"이 연구는 남태평양 도서국인 나우루를 사례로 바다목장의 도입 타당성을 검토하여 해양환경과 어업특성이 반영된 바다목장 모델을 도출하고 사업 추진 방향과 추진 체계를 제시한 것이다. 아울러 우리나라의 남태평양 도서국과의 수산협력 방향에 대해 언급하였다.나우루가 위치한 남태평양은 다랑어와 가다랑어가 생산되는 우리나라뿐만 아니라 각국의 원양어업이 중시하고 있는 지역이다. 나우루는 국가재정이 어려운 개발도상국으로 수산물이 중요한 식량자원이다. 그러나 최근 지구온난화에 의한 해양환경의 변화, 과도한 어획에 따라 연안수산물 생산이 감소하고 있다. 이러한 상황에서 인위적인 어장조성 및 자원조성을 통한 수산자원의 증대를 도모하는 우리나라의 바다목장을 나우루에 도입하는 것은 타당하다고 판단된다. 나우루 연안은 산호초가 발달해 있고 부어류가 많이 회유하는 특성을 고려하여 부어초를 활용한 바다목장으로 조성해 나간다. 또한 해양환경 및 어업 여건을 고려할 때 나우루의 바다목장은 종묘생산 및 방류 등의 자원조성 보다는 부어류를 위집하여 어획할 수 있는 어장조성에 중점을 둘 필요가 있다.이러한 우리나라의 바다목장을 나우루에 적용하는 것은 나우루의 연안어업에 대한 생산기반을 강화함으로써 식량자원인 수산물의 안정적 공급과 어업인 소득 증대, 지역경제 활성화에 기여할 수 있을 것이다. 또한 수산 선진국인 우리나라가 국제사회에서 수산업의 위상을 높일 수 있는 계기도 될 것이다.앞으로 우리나라는 원양어업의 주요 조업어장을 가지고 있는 남태평양 도서국에 대해 밀접한 관계를 유지할 필요가 있다. 지금까지 이들 도서국과의 수산협력과 ODA는 단순한 지원위주로 이뤄져 왔으나 실제로 가지적인 성과를 낼 수 있는 어장조성, 자원조성, 바다목장 등의 맞춤형 프로그램으로 다양하게 전개될 필요가 있다.",,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,1738-1592,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2014-01-01,KJD:ART001941999,,

In OMEGAS II, the project seeks to better understand the drivers of this striking time-space variability, and to link the OA seascape to the physiological and ecological performance of a key member of this ecosystem, the mussel Mytilus californianus. In addition, the investigators will explore the influence of this oceanographic mosaic on species interactions and community organization. As a dominant habitat-forming species, strong interactor, and major space occupant, M. californianus is arguably the core component of the rocky intertidal ecosystem along the upwelling-dominated CCS. Using an interdisciplinary, spatially extensive approach integrating inner shelf oceanography with ecology, physiology, and eco-mechanics, the interdisciplinary team will study the response of juvenile mussels M. californianus to OA. The studies span levels of biological organization, thereby allowing assessment of how the cost of forming a shell under field conditions might influence physiological performance and resistance to predation. This investigation will include modeling to link to larger-scale ecosystem and oceanographic dynamics in the CCS and beyond. Results from OMEGAS I show that the growth, survival, and shell strength of mussel larvae are strongly negatively affected by elevated pCO2, and that growth of adult mussels varied among sites within regions and between regions. Emerging data on natural variability in seawater conditions will allow a deeper exploration of the organismal response of M. californianus, and the ecological consequences of traits, such as reduced shell thickness and strength. The present project will expand and strengthen the existing oceanographic network to increase our understanding of the coastal OA regime, and provide the environmental context for ecological and physiological research.

NIUST is a partnership of the University of Mississippi, the University of Southern Mississippi and NOAA. Before sailing, the Deepwater Horizon oil platform burned and sank, resulting in an uncontrolled oil spill at a depth of 5000 ft at Mississippi Canyon Block 252. Subsequently, the decision was made to abort the planned hydrate and ship wreck research in favor of an oil spill response. The primary goals of the redefined cruise were to acquire baseline and early impact data for seafloor sediments and subsurface distribution of oil and gas hydrates as close as possible in time and space to the origin of the oil spill.Investigating an oil spill nearly a mile deep in the ocean presents special benthic sampling and subsurface oil detection challenges. NIUST's AUV's were unloaded from the ship and a larger main winch installed to allow operation of a large box corer for collecting sediment samples in water depths up to 2000 m. During the first five-day leg of the cruise, a total of 28 box cores were collected. The Pelican returned to port (Cocodrie, LA) to drop off sediment and water samples for immediate analyses, and to take on more sampling gear and supplies for the second leg of the cruise, including an Acrobat, a CDOM fluorometer, a Video Ray ROV, and a CO2 sensor in addition to the already installed CTD Rosette with O-2 sensor and light transmissometer.During Leg 2, box core samples were collected until weather prohibited safe operations. CTD stations were plotted to cover the area surrounding the wreck site and at various depths to cover the water column in order to map the subsurface water column structure and chemistry as baseline values for future investigations and especially to look for submerged oil and/or gas hydrates.Early in the water column sampling, a subsurface feature was discovered at 1200 to 1400 m depth. This layer was detected by three independent sensors, CDOM (colored dissolved organic matter) fluorometer, light transmissometer, and oxygen sensor. All three instruments responded in unison with greater fluorescence and beam attenuation and decreased O2 concentration. These signals were first observed at a station 5 miles from the accident site. Second and third station measurements, exactly half the distance to the spill site from the previous one, at 2.5 miles, and at 1.25 miles, showed the same signal but with significantly greater magnitude. Following this discovery, the sampling plan for the remaining days of the cruise was changed to map the newly discovered feature.This paper will discuss methods, pursuit of leads, gear and instrumentation utilized, resulting in the initial discovery of deep hydrocarbon plume features resulting from the uniquely deep oil spill.",,,,,Washington State Conference and Trade Center (WSCTC)Washington State Conference and Trade Center (WSCTC),"SEP 20-23, 2010SEP 20-23, 2010",IEEE; Marine Technol; OESIEEE; Marine Technol; OES,"Seattle, WASeattle, WA",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,0197-7385,,978-1-4244-4333-8,,,,,,,,,"Univ So Mississippi, Undersea Vehicle Technol Ctr, Natl Inst Undersea Sci & Technol, UM Field Stn 15,CR 2078, Abbeville, MS 38601 USAUniv So Mississippi, Dept Marine Sci, Stennis Space Ctr, MS 39529 USAUniv Mississippi, Natl Inst Undersea Sci & Technol, Seabed Technol Res Ctr, University, MS 38677 USAUniv N Carolina, Dept Marine Sci, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USAUniv Georgia, Dept Marine Sci, Athens, GA 30602 USANatl Inst Undersea Sci & Technol, Abbville, MS 38601 USA",Natl Inst Undersea Sci & Technol,,,2010-01-01,WOS:000287539100249,,

Two largely separate groups of ecologists have emphasized the importance of productivity or resource supply, and consumers or physical disturbance, respectively. These variables show unimodal relationships with diversity when manipulated in isolation(4-8). Recent multivariate models(9-10), however, predict that these factors interact, such that the disturbance-diversity relationship depends on productivity, and vice versa. We tested these models in marine food webs, using field manipulations of nutrient resources and consumer pressure on rocky shores of contrasting productivity. Here we show that the effects of consumers and nutrients on diversity consistently depend on each other, and that the direction of their effects and peak diversity shift between sites of low and high productivity. Factorial meta-analysis of published experiments confirms these results across widely varying aquatic communities.

These reefs clearly are geographically extensive, and possess distinctive features and well-developed reef-facies. They have been found to contain five reef-building communities and were constructed in four periods. Colonial coral-algal reefs at Aohan and Chifeng represent a warm shallow-sea in the Carboniferous. Different reefs in the Xiwu Banner were formed in three periods: early Late Carboniferous, late Late Carboniferous and Early Permian. These reefs were built in warm sea conditions. Their buildup types include colonial coral frameworks, algae-buildings and lime-mud mounds. Bryozoan reefs in the Zhalaite and Dongwu banners were built in the late Middle Permian and thrived in a cold shallow-sea. All reefs grew independently on two kinds of sedimentary platforms, carbonate and carbonate-clastic mixed platforms. Four reef-forming periods occurred later from south to north, along a collisional course between the North China Plate and the Siberian Plate. These reefs can be arranged into three 'reef-links' or reef zones that extend along plate margins. Among these, the Aohan-Chifeng reef-link indicates a northern margin of the North China Plate, the Zhalaite-Dongwu reef-link marks a southern margin of the Siberian Plate, and the Xiwu-Beishan reef-link reflects the former existence of some inter-plates. The strata of each reef-facies are thick and contain rich asphalt deposits. Overlapping and heteropic layers are very thick and contain dark oil/gas-rich horizons; TOC analyses verify that most of these are good hydrocarbon source rocks.

The analysis of numerous hydrocarbon compounds (N = 158) and sediment cores (N = 2,613) suggests that, 1.9 +/- 0.9 x 10(4) metric tons of hydrocarbons (>C9 saturated and aromatic fractions) were deposited in 56% of the studied area, containing 21 +/- 10% (up to 47%) of the total amount of oil discharged and not recovered from the DWH spill. Examination of the spatial trends and chemical diagnostic ratios indicate large deposition of weathered DWH oil in coastal and deep-sea areas and negligible deposition on the continental shelf (behaving as a transition zone in the northern GoM). The large-scale analysis of deposited hydrocarbons following the DWH spill helps understanding the possible long-term fate of the released oil in 2010, including sedimentary transformation processes, redistribution of deposited hydrocarbons, and persistence in the environment as recycled petrocarbon.

Using a patch-landscape approach in an urbanizing region of the Brazilian Atlantic Forest, we tested whether the increase in landscape urbanization reduces plant species density, phylogenetic richness and divergence, and increases the relatedness among co-occurring individuals and species. We assessed plant responses to urbanization in adult (diameter at breast height > 10 cm) and sapling communities (2.5-10 cm diameter) separately, as saplings are proxies of the future flora. We sampled 2860 woody plants belonging to 155 species in nine circular landscapes with urbanization level varying from 0% to 45%, and estimated the relatedness among the species that have increased and decreased in relative abundance in more urbanized landscapes (winner and losers, respectively). As expected, species density and phylogenetic richness decreased with the increase in urbanization. These responses were consistent for adult and sapling communities, suggesting a persistent loss of species and lineages in more urbanized landscapes. Contrary to our expectations, phylogenetic divergence and structure did not respond to urbanization, indicating that the more urbanized landscapes still retain much evolutionary history. However, because the relatedness among winners was greater than among losers, it is likely that the phylogenetic divergence gradually reduces and the relatedness increases, resulting in impoverished forests with uncertain ability to provide ecosystem services such as carbon storage and pest control.

The major oil- and gas-producing companies' search and rescue (SAR) service is responsible for medical evacuations. Using a prospective approach, we describe the characteristics of patients evacuated by SAR. Design and setting A prospective observational study of the offshore primary care provided by SAR in the North Sea. Methods Patients were identified by linking flight information from air transport services in 2015/2016 and the company's medical record system. Standardised forms filled out by SAR nurses during the evacuation were also analysed. In-hospital information was obtained retrospectively from Haukeland University Hospital's information system. Results A total of 381 persons (88% men) were evacuated during the study period. Twenty-seven per cent of missions were due to chest pain and 18% due to trauma. The mean age was 46.0 years. Severity scores were higher for cases due to medical conditions compared with trauma, but the scores were relatively low compared with onshore emergency missions. The busiest months were May, July and December. Weekends were the busiest days. Conclusion Three times as many evacuations from offshore installations are performed due to acute illness than trauma, and cardiac problems are the most common. Although most patients are not severely physiologically deranged, the study documents a need for competent SAR services 24 hours a day year-round. Training and certification should be tailored for the SAR service, as the offshore health service structure and geography differs from the structure onshore.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,2044-6055,,,,,,,,,,,"Haukeland Hosp, Dept Anaesthesia & Intens Care, Bergen, NorwayHaukeland Hosp, Dept Clin Med, Bergen, NorwayOslo Univ Hosp, Natl Advisory Unit Trauma, Oslo, NorwayHaukeland Hosp, Natl Advisory Unit Med Emergency Commun, Bergen, Norway",,,,2020-01-01,WOS:000561427800021,,

The gaseous and liquid hydrocarbons associated with near surface sediments and water have migrated from deep (2000-3000 m) subsurface reservoirs and/or source rocks. This conclusion is based on molecular (GC/FID, GC/FPD, GC/MS) and carbon isotopic evidence. Visual observations at two locations on the continental slope confirm the presence of massive amounts of active liquid as well as gas seepage. Hydrate gas recovered in sediment cores originates from deep, oil-associated gas. This gas has migrated to shallow sediments with little or no isotopic fractionation. In contrast, near surface hydrocarbon liquids (shallow bitumens and sea slicks) are depleted in aliphatics, 4-ring or larger aromatics, naphthalene, C1-naphthalenes and C2-naphthalenes as compared to the reservoired fluids. These near-surface fluids are extensively altered by the concurrent processes of migration, dissolution and microbial degradation. However, the distributions of highly alkylated (> C2) naphthalenes, phenanthrenes and dibenzothiophenes, triterpanes, steranes and triaromatized steranes are similar to the precursor reservoired oil.

It has been protected from commercial whaling since 1977 and is no longer hunted regularly on a large scale anywhere in its range. It is unlikely that the populations of this species have recovered fully from the effects of past commercial exploitation, but the species does not appear to be threatened or endangered at present.

With a large volume of electrical equipment arranged on the deck, the offshore electrical platform is characterized as a top-heavy structure in the offshore wind farm. The dynamic effect of the structure will aggravate the vibration problem of the structure. In this paper, a physical model test was carried out to study the dynamic characteristics of the electrical platform of a 10,000-ton offshore converter station under seismic load. The acceleration response, displacement response and stress response of the offshore electrical platform under the typical direction of seismic action were obtained. The effect of the dry-wet environment, mode of seismic excitation, whipping effect and weak positions of electrical platform structure were analyzed. It was determined that the average damping ratio of the first-order mode of the electrical platform was 5.73% and 8.68% with and without water, respectively.

While some studies have shown positive short-term effects on settlement, to date, none have examined the long-term effects of larval seeding for a broadcast-spawning coral. Here, we test whether larval seeding significantly increases coral recruitment rates both in the short (5 wk) and longer (similar to 6 mo to 1 yr) term. Larvae of Acropora digitifera were reared ex situ, and similar to 1 million larvae were introduced to 7 artificial reefs (ARs) while 7 others were left unseeded. Settlement tiles deployed on both seeded and control ARs were retrieved for examination 5 and 30 wk after seeding. In addition, the presence of visible coral recruits on the AR surfaces was monitored before and for similar to 13 mo post-seeding. Density of acroporid spat was significantly higher on seeded tiles than on controls 5 wk after seeding, but this effect had vanished by 30 wk. Comparison of the densities of new visible Acropora recruits between seeded and control ARs showed no significant difference similar to 13 mo after seeding. Larval seeding therefore had no long-term effect due to high post-settlement mortality (which appeared to be density-related).

This review provides a synthesis of the scientific literature on major oil spills and their impacts on sand beaches, with emphasis on studies documenting effects and recoveries of intertidal invertebrate communities. One of the key observations arising from this review is that more attention has generally been given to studying the impacts of oil spills on invertebrates (mostly macrobenthos), and not to documenting their biological recovery. Biological recovery of sand beach invertebrates is highly dynamic, depending on several factors including site-specific physical properties and processes (e.g., sand grain size, beach exposure), the degree of oiling, depth of oil burial, and biological factors (e.g., species-specific life-history traits). Recovery of affected communities ranges from several weeks to several years, with longer recoveries generally associated with physical factors that facilitate oil persistence, or when cleanup activities are absent on heavily oiled beaches. There are considerable challenges in quantifying impacts from spills on sand beach invertebrates because of insufficient baseline information (e.g., distribution, abundance and composition), knowledge gaps in their natural variability (spatial and temporal), and inadequate sampling and replication during and after oil spills. Thus, environment assessments of impacts and recovery require a rigorous experimental design that controls for confounding sources of variability. General recommendations on sampling strategies and toxicity testing, and a preliminary framework for incorporating species-specific life history traits into future assessments are also provided.

In spring, the fish dispersed throughout the study area to different habitats and, through summer, occupied different larger restricted areas than used in winter. Snapper were highly mobile and demonstrated systematic behaviour at several temporal scales. They moved linear distances of up to, 100 km and could achieve tens of kilometres in a day in episodic movements. Through the year, their activity was distributed across areas of hundreds of square kilometres.

Satellite-derived proxies for phytoplankton (Chlorophyll-a (Chl), Fluorescence Line Height (FLH), Maximum Chlorophyll Index (MCI)) and suspended sediment (Total Suspended Matter (TSM)) were jointly analyzed for two clusters of the Great Barrier Reef Wet tropics (GBRW; 15 degrees-19.5 degrees S; Queensland) and the Van Diemen Gulf (VDG; 9 degrees-13 degrees S; Northern Territory). The analysis of time-series and Hovmoller diagrams of the four MERIS products provided a unique perspective on the processes linking phytoplankton blooms and river runoff, or resuspension, across spatio-temporal scales. Both regions are characterized by a complex oceanography and seasonal inflows of sediment, freshwater and nutrients during the tropical wet season months (November to April). The GBRW is characterized by a great variability in water clarity (Secchi depth 0-25 m). A long history of agricultural land use has led to a large increase in the seasonal discharge of sediments and nutrients, triggering seasonal phytoplankton blooms (>0.4 mg center dot m(-3)) between January and April. In contrast, the VDG is a poorly flushed, turbid (Secchi depth <5 m) environment with strong tidal-energy (4-8 m) and very limited land use. Phytoplankton blooms here were found to have higher Chl concentrations (>1.0 mg center dot m(-3)) than in the GBRW, occurring up to twice a year between January and April. Over the 10-year MERIS mission, a weak decline in Chl and TSM was observed for the VDG (Sen slope: -2.85%/decade, tau = -0.32 and -3.57%/decade, tau = -0.24; p << 0.05), while no significant trend in those two satellite products was observed in the GBRW.

Although Oleispira populations were also present in sea ice, we found that biofilms in sea ice had 25 to 100 times lower bacterial densities than in seawater, which explained the non-detectable n-alkane degradation in sea ice. Fingerprinting revealed that photooxidation, but not biodegradation, transformed polycyclic aromatic compounds through 50 cm-thick sea ice and in the upper water column with removal rates up to similar to 1% per day.Overall, our results showed a fast biodegradation of n-alkanes in sea ice-covered seawater, but suggested that oils spills will expose the Arctic ecosystem to bio-recalcitrant PACs over prolonged periods of time.

The conservation status of the Harbour Porpoise in The Netherlands has recently been evaluated as 'Inadequate', and the population as 'Vulnerable'. From 1900 to the early 1950s, Harbour Porpoises were abundant and widespread in coastal waters throughout the southern North Sea, including Dutch waters. The animal declined and was considered locally extinct during the 1960s-1980s. Harbour Porpoises have increased markedly in numbers in the southern North Sea in recent decades. Given changes in distribution and abundance, the conservation status of porpoises in Dutch waters is likely to require an update in the near-future. Harbour Porpoises are most abundant in relatively shallow sea areas and often forage near or at the sea bottom. Their prey spectrum includes pelagic and demersal prey species: different species of fish, cephalopods, crustaceans and polychaetes. The global abundance of the Harbour Porpoise is at least about 700,000 individuals. Within the North Sea at large, in 2005, total abundance was estimated at 230,000 individuals. A marked change in distribution was found, with considerably larger numbers of porpoises in the southern half of the North Sea in the 2005 than during an earlier census in 1994. Aerial surveys covering 50% of the Dutch sector of the North Sea produced 37,000 Harbour Porpoises in Feb-April 2009 and 56,000 in Mar 2010. The current Harbour Porpoise conservation plan is a generic plan rather than area-orientated: recent research in Dutch waters failed to identify areas or regions of particular ecological significance for Harbour Porpoises for any significant length of time. Incidental capture in fishing gear (bycatch) is considered to be the most significant threat to Harbour Porpoise populations worldwide. In The Netherlands, some 150-250 animals washing ashore per annum are at least bycatch-suspect. The main type of fishing gear responsible for drowning is currently unknown, but set-nets (passive gear) are the main suspects. Bycatches occurred year-round and throughout the study area. The catch composition during which most porpoise strandings occurred varied and no set-net fisheries should be excluded a priori from an observer scheme. An onboard observer scheme should be established with priority in the winter fisheries, Dec-Mar, in the northern coastal zone (IJmuiden- Vlieland). While there is concrete evidence for avoidance behaviour of loud (explosive) underwater sounds (such as pile driving for windfarm construction, seismic exploration, underwater explosions, and naval sonar operation), there is no factual evidence for lethal damage. Adequate studies of hearing damage and death as a result of underwater sound are lacking. The distributional shift of Harbour Porpoises from more northerly parts of the North Sea into the Southern Bight may have been caused by a reduction in available prey in the north. Studies of the ecology of Harbour Porpoises in the southern North Sea are required to shed more light on prey availability and resources (stocks). Siting, vessel strikes, the operational phase of windfarms, offshore mining, marine litter, chemical pollution, (chronic) marine oil pollution, natural predators, infectious disease, and parasites are all issues of concern that may in part require additional study, none of which required local (or regional, i.e. on a southern North Sea scale) mitigation measures, but rather on a higher governance level.

None of the demonstrated threats can be quantified satisfactory, given the slender factual data currently at hand. It is obvious that further research is required, before effective mitigation measures can be proposed and the precautionary approach (UNESCO 2005) could be the safest way forward. The Harbour Porpoise is legally protected in The Netherlands following international, European and national legislation, although the patchiness of current policy does not benefit an adequate protection of the Harbour Porpoise. Implementing the research and mitigation measures, as advised in this species conservation plan, serves to fulfil the requirements of The Netherlands under the relevant international legal treaties. Current research needs have been prioritised on a scale from 1 (highest) to 5 (lowest). Following discussions in Chapter 9, the following research needs are listed with the highest (1) priority Assessments of Harbour Porpoise population through state of the art aerial surveys, including analysis of seasonality and spatial patterns Innovative studies of the (foraging) ecology and habitat requirements of Harbour Porpoises in the Southern North Sea Prioritise an observer scheme on all fleets with passive gear to assess bycatch rates according to internationally accepted protocols Continue to assess bycatch rates in the most important fisheries (regarding bycatch) and evaluate the effectiveness of mitigation measures A national scientific research steering group would be a suitable instrument to deal with aspects such as research needs, research quality and the evaluation of the quality and conclusions of study reports. Such a steering group should be sufficiently authoritative, but also sufficiently distant from the ongoing research. We propose that such a committee should meet and advice annually, and be composed of at least two foreign marine mammals experts, one Dutch Harbour Porpoise expert, and (vitally) one statistician. Recommended policy and mitigation measures are categorized into measures that should be applied at present and measures that depend of further knowledge from the suggested scientific research. Regarding bycatch in fishing gear: Investigate alternative gear other than set-nets and/or investigate modification of set-nets; controlled use of pingers when bycatch is identified Facilitate bycatch landing Restrictions in recreational fisheries, control illegal fisheries Amend EC 812/2004 Monitor and control compliance fisheries restrictions Regarding underwater noise (detonation, seismic, sonar, pile driving) Develop a system of standards for loud explosive sounds; alert animals ramping up sounds, use acoustic deterrents. License and guidelines seismic surveys, pile-driving, underwater explosions; establish porpoise observer schemes before during and after and notification of the strandings network prior to acoustic impacts Reduce noise using bubble curtains, solid barriers, other solutions if proven to be effective; avoid explosives and use an alternative method for windfarm demolition",,,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,,,0923-3210,,,,,,,,,,,"Royal Netherlands Institute for Sea Research, P.O.

Fisheries managers are now attempting to rebuild stocks with a complete fishery closure. Food web models of the Salish Sea depend on current diet data, but lethal methods of diet sampling are not tenable with at-risk rockfish populations. Non-lethal sampling of diets, such as by gastric lavage, had not been attempted with rockfish, but can help minimize depletion of the populations for research needs. The objective of this study was to improve copper rockfish (S. caurinus) diet data in the San Juan Archipelago, using a non-lethal method of gut contents extraction. We used lavage to sample the diet of copper rockfish in San Juan Channel, WA, in fall 2010. Copper rockfish fed primarily on caridean shrimps and other demersal crustaceans, and consumed very few teleost prey. Previous studies of copper rockfish diet documented much higher reliance on teleost and non-shrimp crustacean prey.

Twenty-one strains with the capacity to degrade hydrocarbons and/or produce useful bioemulsifiers were selected. Phylogenetic affiliation of these isolates placed them in the genus Bacillus (8 strains), Pseudomonas (3 strains), Halomonas (4 strains), Pseudoalteromonas (1 strain), Brevibacterium (2 strains), and Marinobacter (1 strain) and 2 strains were identified as marine bacterium. Hydrocarbon degradation was established by determining the amount of alkanes and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons by GC/MS analyses. In this study, Pseudomonas, Bacillus and Brevibacterium strains were the most efficient hydrocarbon-degrading marine bacteria. In contrast, Halomonas strains produced the highest amount of efficient biopolymers with emulsifying activity. The yield, chemical composition and functional properties of these bioemulsifiers were affected by the incubation time required for production. In addition, supplementation of the hydrocarbon culture medium with bioemulsifiers (S22-BE, S24-BE and AD2-BE) clearly stimulated the growth of strains S25. S28 and S29 and enhanced the ability of these strains to biodegrade alkanes, alkenes and aromatic compounds. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

In order to lower the environmental impact of the steel industry and ensure its economic sustainability, there have been significant studies finding the ways to recycle by-products. The formation, composition and physical properties of steel making slag are discussed with regard to the problems associated with its reuse. The volume instability caused by free lime exposure to moisture means that the reuse of steelmaking slag is often limited as many potential applications, and the leaching behavior of steelmaking slag is important for environmental considerations. Land-based applications that have been demonstrated include replacing natural sand as aggregate in cement, which may be combined with the CO2 sequestration properties. Steel slag shows use as a liming material (when spread over acidic soils to help to raise the pH to a more neutral level) and to enhance the physical properties of soft soils. Potential benefits to the marine environment is due to high porosity and large surface area, making slags ideal for coral reef repair (e.g., overcoming coral bleaching) and replacement (e.g., artificial reef to promote growth of green marine plants and seagrass), as well as a growth promoter for seaweed and phytoplankton that are microscopic organisms that are an essential component of ecosystems in oceans around the world.

The spill of 72,000 tonnes of crude oil from the Sea Empress in 1996 affected birds both through direct mortality and likely pollution of key food resources. Numbers were greatly reduced following the spill, whilst changes in the distribution of birds within Carmarthen Bay suggested that potentially sub-optimal foraging zones were used. However, ten years after the incident, numbers of Common Scoter were no different to those recorded immediately before the spill. Compared to some other spills, rapid revival is evident. Numbers increased to pre-spill levels within three winters and distributional changes suggested a concurrent return to previously contaminated feeding areas, implying that the ecosystem had regenerated sufficiently to support its top predator. The importance of prolonged, standardised monitoring of bird numbers and distribution as indicators of ecological recovery from environmental damage is emphasised. (c) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Because different ecosystem services respond differently to management, there are inevitable trade-offs among some of these services, and understanding these trade-offs has gradually become a research hotspot. As the research on trade-offs has deepened, it has become possible to quantify them. Based on the interpretation of remote sensing and socioeconomic data for the Yellow River Delta's coastal wetlands since 1989, the InVEST model was used to evaluate the spatial patterns and dynamic evolution of coastal wetland ecosystem services and the trade-offs among them. Production possibility frontier curves were then selected to identify optimal combinations of ecosystem service values; a trade-off intensity index was constructed to quantify the magnitude of the trade-offs, and the effects of reclamation activities on the trade-offs and synergies among ecosystem services were analyzed. A trade-off existed between material production and habitat quality from 1989 to 2015, and its intensity increased yearly. In addition, the relationship between carbon storage and material production transformed from a synergy into a trade-off in 2008, although the strength of the trade-off has been increasing since then.

Leading indicators of offshore oil and gas activity are the number of permits issued to industry, associated mileage, and expenditures.Over the last 20 years, permit activity has indicated that most of the oil and gas surveying has been in the Gulf of Mexico, where 80% of all permits have been issued, followed by Alaska (10%) the Pacific (7%) and the Atlantic (3%). These statistics correlate with the dominant position of the central and western Gulf of Mexico areas in oil and gas activity. More than 95% of all permits were issued for geophysical exploration mostly for two-dimensional (2-D) common-depth-point (CDP) seismic data. However, over the last 10 years, permits for three-dimensional (3-D) seismic data have averaged 25% of all geophysical permits and, by 1996 made up approximately half of all geophysical permits offshore-wide.Between 1976 and the early 1990s, industry shot approximately 500,000 line-miles of 2-D CDP data each year on the Outer Continental Shelf (OCS). Of that total, MMS acquired approximately 50,000 line-miles annually.

The majority of 2-D and 3-D data have been acquired in the Gulf of Mexico by a ratio of 2:1 over Alaska, the next largest data inventory.With regard to MMS expenditures for G & G data, from 1976 through the 1980s, Alaska, having more offshore area than the other three regions combined, had the largest portion.

This paper studied active control of riser VIV by tuning the tensioner output force (pretension) so that this method can be utilized in short-term operation, such as drilling, without adding additional high-cost systems. A novel active control method by using neural network in tuning top tension of marine riser was studied to examine the effectiveness of VIV suppression.

Bubble sizes are estimated for the blowout scenario for input to TAMOC. Results suggest that a major CO2 blowout in >= 50 m of water will be almost entirely attenuated by the water column due to CO2 dissolution into seawater during upward rise. In contrast, the same blowout in 10 m of water will hardly be attenuated at all. Results also show that the size of the orifice of the leak strongly controls the CO2 blowout rate.

While many of these are not mutually exclusive, they cannot all be simultaneously maximised so that management compromise is inevitable. We used a 42-year dataset from a naturally regenerating floodplain forest of the river red gum (Eucalyptus camaldulensis) to investigate the effects of pre-commercial thinning on long-term patterns in habitat quality, forest structure and rates of carbon storage (i.e. standing aboveground carbon). Estimates of habitat quality were based on the density of hollow-bearing trees because hollows are ecologically important to many species of vertebrates and invertebrates in these forests. Thinning improved habitat value by producing 20 (+/-8) hollow-bearing trees per ha after 42 years, while the unthinned treatment produced none. Unthinned (highest density) stands were dominated by many slender trees, mostly <25 cm in diameter, whereas thinned stands produced negatively skewed size distributions with higher median and maximum stem diameters. Moderately thinned stands (560 trees ha(-1)) had the highest aboveground carbon storage rate (4.1 t C year(-1)) and the highest aboveground carbon stocks (200.2 +/- 9.6 t C ha(-1)) after 42 years, while the unthinned treatment had the lowest carbon storage rate (1.6 t C year(-1)) and an intermediate level of aboveground standing carbon (165.1 +/- 31.1 t C ha(-1)). Our results highlight the importance of early stand density as a determinant of long-term forest structure, habitat quality and carbon storage rates. We recommend that thinning be considered as one component of a broader strategy for enhancing the structure, habitat value and aboveground carbon storage of developing floodplain forests.

Here, the performance of several bioremediation tools such as emulsifiers, multi-enzyme liquid (MEL), microbes, and rice-straw was evaluated by a 90-days semi-field experiment, particularly targeting recovery of benthic community. Temporal efficiency in the removal of sedimentary total petroleum hydrocarbons (TPH), reduction of residual toxicity, and recovery of bacterial diversity, microalgal growth, and benthic production was comprehensively determined. Concentrations of TPH and amphipod mortality for all treatments rapidly decreased within the first 10 days. In addition, the density of bacteria and microphytobenthos generally increased over time for all treatments, indicating recovery in the benthic community health. However, the recovery of some nitrifying bacteria, such as the class Nitrospinia (which are sensitive to oil components) remained incomplete (13-56%) during 90 days. Combination of microbe treatments showed rapid and effective for recovering the benthic community, but after 90 days, all treatments showed high recovery efficiency. Of consideration, the no action treatment showed a similar level of recovery to those of microbe and MEL treatments, indicating that the natural recovery process could prevail in certain situations.

Additionally, the reduced space and the limited weight budget on offshore platforms have discouraged operators from integrating more efficient, but also bulkier cogeneration cycles (e.g. combined cycles). In spite of these circumstances, more stringent environmental regulations of offshore oil and gas activities have progressively led to a renewed interest in the integration of advanced cogeneration systems, together with either customary or unconventional carbon capture approaches, to maintain both higher power generation efficiencies and reduced CO2 emissions. Thus, in this paper, it is evidenced how advanced gas turbine concepts are promising technologies for maintaining or even increasing efficiency, while facilitating the capture rate of CO2 produced, either for geological storage or enhanced oil recovery. Despite the profuse research works on onshore applications, advanced cogeneration and carbon capture systems have been barely studied in the context of supplying power to offshore petroleum platforms. Accordingly, the performance of a conventional offshore petroleum production platform (without carbon capture system) is compared to other configurations, based on either an amine-based chemical absorption system or oxyfuel combustion concepts (S-Graz and Allam cycles) for CO2 capture purposes. Since the original power and heat requirements of the processing platform must remain satisfied, an energy integration analysis is performed to determine the waste heat recovery opportunities. Additionally, the exergy method helps quantifying the most critical components that lead to the largest irreversibility and identifying the thermodynamic potential for enhanced cogeneration plants. As a result, oxyfuel equipped platforms provide a diversified set of advantages, while keeping competitive efficiencies. For instance, advanced systems allow for cutting down ostensibly the atmospheric CO2 emissions compared to the conventional and amine-based power plant configurations of the FPSO.

S. Endangered Species Act (ESA) in 2008, mostly due to the significant threat to their future population viability from rapidly declining Arctic sea ice. A core mandate of the ESA is the development of a recovery plan that identifies steps to maintain viable populations of a listed species. A substantive evaluation of the relative influence of putative threats to population persistence is helpful to recovery planning. Because management actions must often be taken in the face of substantial information gaps, a formalized evaluation hypothesizing potential stressors and their relationships with population persistence can improve identification of relevant conservation actions. To this end, we updated a Bayesian network model previously used to forecast the future status of polar bears worldwide. We used new information on actual and predicted sea ice loss and polar bear responses to evaluate the relative influence of plausible threats and their mitigation through management actions on the persistence of polar bears in four ecoregions. We found that polar bear outcomes worsened over time through the end of the century under both stabilized and unabated greenhouse gas (GHG) emission pathways. Under the unabated pathway (i.e., RCP 8.5), the time it took for polar bear populations in two of four ecoregions to reach a dominant probability of greatly decreased was hastened by about 25 years. Under the stabilized GHG emission pathway (i.e., RCP 4.5), where GHG emissions peak around the year 2040, the polar bear population in the Archipelago Ecoregion of High Arctic Canada never reached a dominant probability of greatly decreased, reinforcing earlier suggestions of this ecoregion's potential to serve as a long-term refugium. The most influential drivers of adverse polar bear outcomes were declines to overall sea ice conditions and to the marine prey base. Improved sea ice conditions substantively lowered the probability of a decreased or greatly decreased outcome, while an elevated marine prey base was slightly less influential in lowering the probability of a decreased or greatly decreased outcome. Stressors associated with in situ human activities exerted considerably less influence on population outcomes. Reduced mortality from hunting and defense of life and property interactions resulted in modest declines in the probability of a decreased or greatly decreased population outcome. Minimizing other stressors such as trans-Arctic shipping, oil and gas exploration, and point-source pollution had negligible effects on polar bear outcomes, but that could be attributed to uncertainties in the ecological relevance of those specific stressors. Our findings suggest adverse consequences of loss of sea ice habitat become more pronounced as the summer ice-free period lengthens beyond 4 months, which could occur in portions of the Arctic by the middle of this century under the unabated pathway. The long-term persistence of polar bears may be achieved through ameliorating the loss of sea ice habitat, which will likely require stabilizing CO2 emissions at or below the ceiling represented by RCP 4.5. Management of other stressors may serve to slow the transition of polar bear populations to progressively worsened outcomes, and improve the prospects of persistence, pending GHG mitigation.",,,,,,,,,5,0,0,0,5,0,5,,,0196-1497,,,,,,,,,,,"US Geol Survey, 959 Natl Ctr, Reston, VA, 22092, USA",,,,2014-01-01,ZOOREC:ZOOR15304021580,,

Both species are important components of arctic terrestrial and nearshore ecosystems and they interact with existing oil and gas development in the central Beaufort Sea region, and are likely to interact with new offshore and onshore developments. Much of our current knowledge about bear populations, habitat use, movements, and interactions with oil and gas activities on the North Slope has been the result of repeated observations of telemetrically collared bears (VHF and satellite). For polar bears in particular, much of the information comes from females and subadults because adult male bears have a low retention rate for collars due to their neck anatomy. Application of existing and emerging Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) technology, currently used for military and commerce, has the potential to significantly increase the sample size of marked bears by decreasing the cost and providing a way to mark male bears. The goal of this research and development project was to test the feasibility of the RFID system for grizzly and polar bear research and management by modifying the tags so they could be attached to bear ears and by modifying the reader and antenna system for use in aircraft and land vehicles. RFID ear tags were placed on 52 polar bears and 22 grizzly bears in 2006 and 20 polar bears in 2007. Signals from tags were received from up to 500 m at ground level and up to 1.7 km from an aircraft at approximately 600 m altitude. Although RFID signal range exceeded our expectations, tag retention, especially for grizzly bear females with dependent young, was a major limitation. Due to the effective range of RFID tags other configurations (e.g., subcutaneous implants) may provide a solution to tag retention.

Evidence of this early intrigue dates back to 130,000 BCE, but the advent of remotely operated vehicles (ROVs) in the 1950s introduced technology that has had significant impact on ocean exploration. Today, ROVs play a critical role in both military (e. g. retrieving torpedoes and mines) and salvage operations (e.g. locating historic shipwrecks such as the RMS Titanic), and are crucial for oil and gas (O& G) exploration and operations. Industrial ROVs collect millions of observations of our oceans each year, fueling scientific discoveries. Herein, we assembled a group of international ROV experts fromboth academia and industry to reflect on these discoveries and, more importantly, to identify key questions relating to our oceans that can be supported using industry ROVs. From a long list, we narrowed down to the 10 most important questions in ocean science that we feel can be supported (whole or in part) by increasing access to industry ROVs, and collaborationswith the companies that use them. The questions covered opportunity (e. g. what is the resource value of the oceans?) to the impacts of global change (e. g. which marine ecosystems are most sensitive to anthropogenic impact?). Looking ahead, we provide recommendations for how data collected by ROVs can be maximised by higher levels of collaboration between academia and industry, resulting in winwin outcomes. What is clear from this work is that the potential of industrial ROV technology in unravelling the mysteries of our oceans is only just beginning to be realised. This is particularly important as the oceans are subject to increasing impacts from global change and industrial exploitation. The coming decadeswill represent an important time for scientists to partner with industry that use ROVs in order to make the most of these ` eyes in the sea'. (C) 2018 Published by Elsevier B.

The ship sank off one of the flanks of the Galician Bank, an offshore seamount, and a major oil spill drifted to the N and NW Iberian coast mainly driven by dominant winds. Coastal circulation was characterized by freshwater plumes and the poleward slope current, and could have affected the fate of the oil spill and influenced stranding places. Seasonal evolution of oceanographic conditions in this particular year is compared with the long-term average and reveals specific features that need to be taken into account in studies of the impact of the oil spill on populations. Spring conditions commenced earlier than other years in the Southern Bay of Biscay, contrastingly in western Iberia. The lack of subsurface intrusion of subtropical waters suggests a low intense penetration of the poleward current in Spanish Biscay slopes. In western Iberia, the slope poleward current observed in late autumn weakens and is exported off slope during upwelling pulses in the spring, with no strong intrusion of the poleward current on the slope at the time of the spring bloom. A description of current velocities near the wreck on the Galician Bank is obtained after the analysis of a mooring line. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

The oil and gas infrastructure in the Gulf of Mexico is well suited for mariculture systems as these platforms are large, sturdy and long lasting, and designed to operate in the offshore environment. The purpose of this paper is to discuss the costs and benefits of a open ocean aquaculture industry in the Gulf of Mexico with particular focus on platform-based aquaculture.

Easily recognizable variations in intrinsic factors are limited, constraining experimental parameters. Application of extrinsic marking systems enables validation of biocenosis assumptions and expands experimental parameters, especially relating to species, habitat configuration, and spatial and temporal scales. Fish tags are successful extrinsic identification systems that are seldom used to mark juvenile or small-sized reef fishes, usually due to physical incompatibility between the size of the fish and external tags. The binary-coded wire tag (CWT), alpha-numeric-coded Visible Implant (VI) tap and Visible Implant Fluorescent (VIF) filament tag, are bio-compatible internal micro-tags that were tested in this study for applications in marking juvenile temperate reef fishes. Three tests of CWT resulted in 100% retention at 330d, 310d, and 68d, for Sebastes caurinus, S. maliger, S. auriculatus, and S. emphaeus (36-94 mm TL at tagging).

The supply network includes direct road transport and a sea route along the coast. To gain insight into modal split decisions between road and sea transport from the shipper's perspective multi-period mixed integer optimization models are formulated. Particularly the models give possibilities to examine how weekly demand patterns at supply bases, cargo commitments to sea transport, storage possibilities at supply bases, and shipper's responsibility for a certain share of vessel capacity may effect the emissions and the modal split. Experiments on real data from an oil and gas company operating offshore show that the size of the share of vessel capacity and the possibility for storage at supply bases are the major determinants for a larger shift to environmentally friendly sea transport. The models can be used as means for making decisions regarding how a shipper can commit to sea transport to achieve less emissions. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

To advise coastal managers, models must predict quantitatively the effects of environmental change on population size or the demographic rates (mortality and reproduction) that determine it. As habitat association models and depletion models are not able to do this, we developed an approach that has produced such predictions thereby enabling policy makers to make evidence-based decisions. Our conceptual framework is individual-based ecology, in which populations are viewed as having properties (e.g. size) that arise from the traits (e.g. behaviour, physiology) and interactions of their constituent individuals. The link between individuals and populations is made through individual-based models (IBMs) that follow the fitness-maximising decisions of individuals and predict population-level consequences (e.g. mortality rate) from the fates of these individuals. Our first IBM was for oystercatchers Haematopus ostralegus and accurately predicted their density-dependent mortality. Subsequently, IBMs were developed for several shorebird and wildfowl species at several European sites, and were shown to predict accurately overwinter mortality, and the foraging behaviour from which predictions are derived. They have been used to predict the effect on survival in coastal birds of sea level rise, habitat loss, wind farm development, shellfishing and human disturbance. This review emphasises the wider applicability of the approach, and identifies other systems to which it could be applied. We view the IBM approach as a very useful contribution to the general problem of how to advance ecology to the point where we can routinely make meaningful predictions of how populations respond to environmental change.",,,,,,,,,71,0,0,0,70,0,80,,,1464-7931,1469-185X,,,,,,,,,,"Bournemouth Univ, Sch Conservat Sci, Poole BH12 5BB, Dorset, EnglandHavering, Lympstone EX8 5JT, Devon, England",Havering,,,2010-08-01,WOS:000279722700001,19961470,

This study aimed at assessing the crude oil bioremediation potential of the chronically polluted Lebanese shores in light of the continuous discharge of nutrient-rich sewage into the Mediterranean Sea and the long-lasting absence of proper sewage treatment systems. It was anticipated that, with the high pollution levels of the coastline, background concentrations of nutrients would be sufficient to sustain high intrinsic biodegradation rates without human intervention. Biodegradation experiments were conducted using crude oil-spiked beach sediments and seawater under natural attenuation and biostimulation conditions. The experiments were conducted at 18 and 28 degrees C to account for seasonal variation in temperature, background nutrient levels, and microbial communities. The biodegradability of oil constituents - namely alkanes and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), was monitored over a 42-day period using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Under biostimulation conditions, significant enhancement in the overall biodegradation rates of alkanes and PAHs was observed in seawater at 18 and 28 degrees C, while little to no improvement was measured at both temperatures in sediments where background nutrient levels were sufficient to induce near maximum intrinsic biodegradation rates. Under both natural attenuation and biostimulation treatments, the increase in temperature increased the oil biodegradation rates in sediment and seawater microcosms. In both instances, the overall trend in the biodegradation of individual alkanes and PAHs suggested a typical decrease in biodegradation rates with the increase in carbon number/rings and alkyl groups.

SERPENT (Scientific & Environmental Rov Partnership using Existing iNdustrial Technology) is a collaboration programme that was designed to make better use of remotely operated vehicle (ROV) technology and data available through links with marine operations in the oil and gas industry. Oil and gas exploration and production activities in the marine environment are increasing. The amount of global hydrocarbon reserves removed from below the seafloor is set to increase over the next 5-10 years, with exploration heading into deeper, more remote waters, many of which have yet to be fully explored. The only way that these remote areas may be documented is through a working relationship with industry, with mutual benefit for both sides and learning from technology that is already in place for the benefit of science.",,,,,,,,,8,0,0,0,3,0,10,,,0141-0814,,,,,,,,,,,"Natl Oceanog Ctr, SERPENT Project, George Deacon Div Ocean Proc, Southampton, Hants, EnglandUniv Aberdeen, OceanLab, Newburgh, Aberdeen, Scotland",,,,2005-01-01,WOS:000235391900003,,

The Louisiana coastal erosion problem is especially dire because it occurs on several fronts with the narrowing and overtopping of barrier islands and loss of back barrier bay and interior marshlands. Coastal restoration efforts in Louisiana depend on emplacement of sediment to build up barrier island and deltaic systems. Discovery of usable sediment is thus a vital factor in restoration efforts because up to 80% of some restoration project budgets can be allocated to exploration, exploitation, and emplacement of sediment. Because this cost is directly proportional to the distance of borrow sources from the project area, the cost-effectiveness of barrier island restoration and marsh creation depends on locating sufficient sediment volumes that are suitable for placement on beaches and dunes and for creating marshes.The restoration of Louisiana's barrier islands and the creation of coastal marshes are critically dependent on the availability of suitable modern marine and riverine sediments and other buried fluvio-deltaic deposits. It is thus imperative that a comprehensive sediment management plan be developed to systematically and efficiently identify and allocate suitable sediment resources. At present, coastal and barrier island restoration projects are included in regional planning efforts, and the restoration project is decided before sediment sources are considered. The new approach proposed here is based on planning projects around locations of dredgeable sedimentary deposits in order to optimize sediment resources. Centralization of voluminous historical geoscientific and oil and gas infrastructure data is being accommodated in a new data management system called the Louisiana Sand Resource Database (LASARD). Managing sediment resources more strategically optimizes regional planning strategies and reduces construction costs. The Louisiana Sediment Management Plan (LASMP) conceptualizes systematic planning and better coordination of essential components of the huge restoration and protection effort currently undertaken in Louisiana.",,,,,,,,,23,0,0,0,10,0,30,,,0749-0208,1551-5036,,,,,,,,,,"Florida Atlantic Univ, Dept Geosci, Boca Raton, FL 33431 USALouisiana Off Coastal Protect & Restorat, Baton Rouge, LA 70801 USALouisiana State Univ, Sch Coast & Environm, Inst Coastal Studies, Baton Rouge, LA 70803 USA",Louisiana Off Coastal Protect & Restorat,,,2010-07-01,WOS:000280210500001,,

A spring bloom of phytoplankton occurred during the 90-d suspension period in 1995. Hydrocarbons isolated from the 1995 suspended mussels showed very high concentrations of both biogenic hydrocarbons and very long-chain n-alkanes from C-20 to C-32, initially thought to be petrogenic. Both types of hydrocarbons were either not detected or were only present in trace amounts in the mussels suspended in 1994 at similar sites. The biogenic hydrocarbons in the 1995 mussels were apparently of planktonic origin, from the spring bloom, and were dominated by heneicosahexaene (21:6), followed by pristane, heptadecane, and various monounsaturated and polyunsaturated phytenes, heptadecenes, nonadecenes and heneicosenes. They could be readily hydrogenated to yield the basic alkanes. The 1995 mussels suspended within 1 km from the oil well platform were probably slightly tainted by petrogenic hydrocarbons, as evidenced by the detection of phytane and high concentrations of total aliphatic hydrocarbons, whereas the mussels suspended 10 km from the platform showed only high concentrations of biogenic hydrocarbons and the novel long-chain n-alkanes. The occurrence of an unusual phytoplankton bloom during the suspension period severely interfered with the petroleum monitoring role of mussels by altering the mussel hydrocarbon profiles through the accumulation into and probably selective depuration of xenobiotic hydrocarbons from the mussel tissues.",,,,,,,,,8,0,0,0,7,1,11,,,0025-3162,,,,,,,,,,,"TECH UNIV NOVA SCOTIA,CANADIAN INST FISHERIES TECHNOL,HALIFAX,NS B3J 2X4,CANADAJOHN PARSONS & ASSOC BIOL CONSULTANTS,DARTMOUTH,NS B2Y 3Y5,CANADA",JOHN PARSONS & ASSOC BIOL CONSULTANTS,,,1996-09-01,WOS:A1996VK87000016,,

In this paper, we present a methodology for the stochastic inversion of ultra-high-frequency (UHF, 0.24.0 kHz) pre-stack seismic reflection waveforms, designed to obtain a decimetric-resolution remote elastic characterization of the shallow sediments with minimal pre-processing and little a priori information. We use a genetic algorithm in which the space of possible solutions is sampled by explicitly decoupling the short and longwavelengths of the P-wave velocity model. This approach, combined with an objective function robust to cycle skipping, outperforms a conventional model parametrization when the ground-truth is offset from the centre of the search domain. The robust P-wave velocity model is used to precondition the width of the search range of the multiparameter elastic inversion, thereby improving the efficiency in high-dimensional parametrizations. Multiple independent runs provide a set of independent results from which the reproducibility of the solution can be estimated. In a real data set acquired in Finneidfjord, Norway, we also demonstrate the sensitivity of UHF seismic inversion to shallow subseabed anomalies that play a role in submarine slope stability. Thus, the methodology has the potential to become an important practical tool for marine ground model building in spatially heterogeneous areas, reducing the reliance on expensive and time-consuming coring campaigns for geohazard mitigation in marine areas.",,,,,,,,,9,0,0,0,0,0,9,,,0956-540X,1365-246X,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Southampton, Natl Oceanog Ctr, Ocean & Earth Sci, European Way, Southampton SO14 3ZH, Hants, EnglandNatl Oceanog Ctr, Marine Geosci Grp, European Way, Southampton SO14 3ZH, Hants, England",,,,2018-08-06,WOS:000439648000011,,

In the current standard using by O&G industry in Malaysia which is PETRONAS Technical Guideline (PTG), CoF are being generally classified as in comprehensive because it does not consider many factors. Identifying more factors leads to better risk assessment as it helps in reducing unnecessary inspection or maintenance that could lead to excessive allocation of money for risk assessment.

J,,,,,,,,,"Hickey, Barbara","McCabe, Ryan","Structure of cross-shelf circulation in a buoyancy-influenced, wind-driven Eastern Boundary Current system",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Awarded Grant,Sep 01 2013,2013,"The overarching goal of this project is to understand the patterns and driving mechanisms of subtidal cross-isobath (inshore/offshore) circulation in a wind-forced Eastern Boundary Current (EBC) system such as the California Current System (CSS) where buoyancy sources affect stratification and the mean circulation is seasonally-dependent. Specifically, project objectives are: 1) Determine the response of cross-isobath circulation over the mid-shelf to local and remote forcing during the upwelling season as a function of stratification, 2) Determine the cross-margin extent of the identified cross-isobath circulation patterns, 3) Determine how the cross-isobath response changes seasonally. The objectives will be met through application of a newly developed method of isolating the cross-isobath circulation to 1) analysis of an existing and untapped set of observations and 2) analysis of upcoming NSF-funded Ocean Observatory Initiative (OOI) Endurance Array observations that will span the continental margin year-round at two separate along-shelf locations in the northern CCS. Cross-margin exchange remains one of the least understood processes in EBC systems. Although progress has been made on understanding near-surface dynamics and transports, the origin, structure, and timing of the deeper compensating return flows have proven elusive. Much of our lack of understanding stems from the fact that cross-isobath flows are difficult to accurately isolate: 1) cross-isobath flows are generally much weaker than coincident along-isobath flows, and 2) water column velocity measurements often do not span the crucial surface and bottom boundary layers. Analyses often hinge on removal of the instantaneous depth-averaged cross-isobath velocity in order to relate the residual structure and its temporal variability to external forcing. This approach avoids the otherwise unbalanced depth-averaged along-shelf momentum that results from a slight veering-over of along-isobath currents, as occurs when a meander or eddy passes by a measurement location. However, this methodology can leave significant biases in the vertical structure of both the mean and fluctuating cross-isobath velocity profiles if the along-isobath flow is vertically sheared, as is often the case in EBC systems such as off the western US, Peru and Chile, and parts of Africa. A newly-developed technique that eliminates these biases and has shown promise at a mid-shelf location in the northern CCS will be employed to isolate the cross-isobath circulation in existing and upcoming observational data sets. Except during spring the seasonal mean surface pressure gradient opposes the along-isobath flow in the northern CCS. This offers a dynamical counter-example to other shelf regions such as those off the northeast US where flows are down the pressure gradient. Cross-margin exchange regulates water property distributions (heat, salt, and oxygen), nutrient availability, larval recruitment of invertebrates and fish, and pollutant and sediment dispersal, including export to the open ocean. Because of these wide-ranging and important applications and because understanding of cross-isobath circulation has historically been so elusive, the outcomes of this project will themselves be of broad impact. The project will provide new methodology and insights that may be used and tested in other coastal settings with regional current jets and/or significant eddy fields. The project will provide educational activities for a Postdoctoral Fellow/early career scientist, graduate student teaching, local resource managers, and an undergraduate student. In particular, results will be incorporated into a graduate level class at the UW that attracts biological and fisheries oceanography students with interdisciplinary interests in along- and cross-shelf motion. Regional partners, e.g., from WA Dept. of Health and WA Dept. of Fish & Wildlife, will be trained on the use of OOI data streams and products as tools for coastal resource management. Last, an undergraduate student will gain experience with the use and application of cutting-edge OOI datasets, with the goal of presenting their results at the annual UW Undergraduate Research Symposium.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,1332753,,,,,,,,University of Washington,,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:13721533,,

During a research cruise in August 2010, analysis of water collected in the NEGOM indicated that samples of 3 of 14 (21%) stations were toxic to bacteria based on the Microtox assay, 4 of 13 (34%) were toxic to phytoplankton via the QwikLite assay, and 6 of 14 (43%) showed DNA damaging activity using the lambda-Microscreen Prophage induction assay. The Microtox and Microscreen assays indicated that the degree of toxicity was correlated to total petroleum hydrocarbon concentration. Long-term monitoring of stations on the NEGOM and the WFS was undertaken by 8 and 6 cruises to these areas, respectively. Microtox toxicity was nearly totally absent by December 2010 in the Northeastern Gulf of Mexico (3 of 8 cruises with one positive station). In contrast, QwikLite toxicity assay yielded positives at each cruise, often at multiple stations or depths, indicating the greater sensitivity of the QwikLite assay to environmental factors. The Microscreen mutagenicity assays indicated that certain water column samples overlying the WFS were mutagenic at least 1.5 years after capping the Macondo well. Similarly, sediment porewater samples taken from 1000, 1200, and 1400 m from the slope off the WFS in June 2011 were also highly genotoxic. Our observations are consistent with a portion of the dispersed oil from the Macondo well area advecting to the southeast and upwelling onto the WFS, although other explanations exist.

Both governments and operators must develop accurate cost estimates for offshore platform decommissioning. The government requires them to guide its negotiations with decommissioning contractors, while operators require them to determine annual remittances to decommissioning accounts built into modern day oil and gas concession contracts. Consequently, a reliable cost estimation method could be used to define a Zone of Possible Agreement (ZOPA) for offshore platform decommissioning in Malaysian waters before engaging in negotiations with contractors.

Habitat suitability models are fundamental to developing this understanding; however their use in management continues to be limited due to often-vague model objectives and inadequate evaluation methods. Along the Northeast Pacific coast, canopy kelps (Macrocystis pyrifera and Nereocystis luetkeana) provide biogenic habitat and considerable primary production to nearshore ecosystems. We investigated the distribution of these species by examining a series of increasingly complex habitat suitability models ranging from process-based models based on species' ecology to complex generalised additive models applied to purpose-collected survey data. Seeking empirical limits to model complexity, we explored the relationship between model complexity and forecast skill, measured using both cross-validation and independent data evaluation. Our analysis confirmed the importance of predictors used in models of coastal kelp distributions developed elsewhere (i.e. depth, bottom type, bottom slope, and exposure); it also identified additional important factors including salinity, and potential interactions between exposure and salinity, and slope and tidal energy. Comparative results showed how cross-validation can lead to over-fitting, while independent data evaluation clearly identified the appropriate model complexity for generating habitat forecasts. Our results also illustrate that, depending on the evaluation data, predictions from simpler models can out-perform those from more complex models. Collectively, the insights from evaluating multiple models with multiple data sets contribute to the holistic assessment of model forecast skill. The continued development of methods and metrics for evaluating model forecasts with independent data, and the explicit consideration of model objectives and assumptions, promise to increase the utility of model forecasts to decision makers.",,,,,,,,,30,0,0,0,24,0,33,,,0906-7590,1600-0587,,,,,,,,,,"Univ British Columbia, Inst Res Environm & Sustainabil, Vancouver, BC, CanadaWildlife Management Advisory Council NWT, Inuvik, NT, CanadaOregon State Univ, Hatfield Marine Sci Ctr, Marine Mammal Inst, Newport, OR 97365 USAOregon State Univ, Hatfield Marine Sci Ctr, Dept Fisheries & Wildlife, Newport, OR 97365 USA",Wildlife Management Advisory Council NWT,,,2019-03-01,WOS:000460078900003,,

Under OPA '90 and Executive Order (EO) 12777, the MMS authority for oil spill prevention and response has expanded to include all offshore facilities except for those associated with deepwater ports. MMS was also given authority for financial responsibility of offshore facilities under OPA '90 and its 1996 amendments.To ensure that the responsibilities delegated to the MMS under OPA '90 for all offshore oil and gas facilities are implemented, the Pacific OCS Region (POCSR) of the MMS has embarked on the development of an implementation plan. Additionally, the OPA '90 Implementation Plan emphasizes components of several Memorandums of Agreement and Understanding between the MMS and other agencies to ensure a coordinated oil spill prevention and response program. This coordination provides for, among other measures, the sharing of technical expertise in drilling, production, pollution prevention, and other related specialty areas of offshore operations and safety.This paper discusses several critical efforts undertaken by the POCSR to develop a well-coordinated oil spill prevention and response program under OPA '90 for offshore California.

The final design of the larval cradle was cylindrical, a nylon mesh structure with a volume of 9 m(3), suspended in the sea and extending vertically toward the seabed. We found three key design features that improved the efficiency of the apparatus: (1) an open area of sea surface and mesh size of less than 100 mu m produced high fertilization and optimal survival (>90%), (2) a special skirt-shaped net (3 m in diameter) with a connection hose for attaching the cradle to collect bundles from many adult colonies over a wide area and at various depths, and (3) adding short square tube pieces, called square hollow sections, as a substrate for enhancing larval settlement and survival, to a larval cradle at 4 days after spawning was optimal for uniform settlement.

This paper presents a self-report scale developed to measure the WSA of drilling personnel, and examines the influence of the performance shaping factors of stress and fatigue upon WSA, and the relationship between WSA, unsafe behaviour and accident involvement. A questionnaire designed to measure these variables was completed by 185 drillers working offshore on the UK Continental Shelf (UKCS). The total WSA scale was found to exhibit acceptable internal reliability (Cronbach's alpha = 0.86). Sub-scales measuring concentration; attention; anticipation and distraction had coefficients between 0.65 and 0.79. Higher levels of stress, sleep disruption and fatigue were significantly associated with lower levels of WSA. In a regression analysis, stress was found to be the only significant predictor of WSA. In relation to safety outcomes, lower WSA was related to increased participation in unsafe behaviour. Individuals who had previously been involved in a work accident had significantly lower WSA scores than those who had not had an accident. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Remotely operated vehicles (ROVs) offer a robust survey tool for quantifying these pressures and tracking the success of management intervention while at a range of depths, including those inaccessible to most SCUBA diver-based survey methods (~30 m). As the strengths, limitations, and biases of ROVs for visually monitoring fish assemblages remain unclear, this review aims to evaluate ROVs as a survey technique and to suggest optimal sampling strategies for use in typical ROV-based studies. Using the search engines Scopus and Google Scholar, 119 publications were identified that used ROVs for visual surveys of fish assemblages. While the sampling strategies and sampling metrics used to annotate the imagery in these publications varied considerably, the total abundance of fish recorded over strip transects of varying dimensions was the most common sampling design. The choice of ROV system appears to be a strong indicator of both the types of surveys available to studies and the success of ROV deployments. For instance, larger, more powerful working-class systems can complete longer and more complex designs (e.g., swath, cloverleaf, and polygonal transects) at greater depths, whereas observation-class systems are less expensive and easier to deploy, but are more susceptible to delays or cancelations of deployments. In more severe sea state conditions, radial transects, or strip transects that employ live-boating or a weight to anchor the tether to the seafloor, can be used to improve the performance of observation-class systems. As these systems often employ shorter tethers, radial transects can also be used to maximize sampling area at greater depths and on large vessels that may rotate substantially while anchored. For highly mobile species, and in survey designs where individuals are likely to be recounted (e.g., transects along oil and gas pipelines), relative abundance (MaxN) may be a more robust sampling metric. By identifying subtle, yet important, differences in the application of ROVs as a tool for visually surveying deep-water marine ecosystems, we identified key areas for improvement for best practice for future studies.

Coral reefs and the ecosystems they support are regarded as one of the most vulnerable ecosystems to ocean acidification, threatening their long-term viability. In response to this threat, different strategies for buffering the impact of ocean acidification have been proposed. As the pH experienced by individual corals on a natural reef system depends on many processes over different time scales, the efficacy of these buffering strategies remains largely unknown. Here we assess the feasibility and potential efficacy of a reef-scale (a few kilometers) carbon removal strategy, through the addition of seaweed (fleshy multicellular algae) farms within the Great Barrier Reef at the Heron Island reef. First, using diagnostic time-dependent age tracers in a hydrodynamic model, we determine the optimal location and size of the seaweed farm. Secondly, we analytically calculate the optimal density of the seaweed and harvesting strategy, finding, for the seaweed growth parameters used, a biomass of 42 g N m(-2) with a harvesting rate of up 3.2 g N m(-2) d(-1) maximises the carbon sequestration and removal. Numerical experiments show that an optimally located 1.9 km(2) farm and optimally harvested seaweed (removing biomass above 42 g N m(-2) every 7 d) increased aragonite saturation by 0.1 over 24 km(2) of the Heron Island reef. Thus, the most effective seaweed farm can only delay the impacts of global ocean acidification at the reef scale by 7-21 years, depending on future global carbon emissions. Our results highlight that only a kilometer-scale farm can partially mitigate global ocean acidification for a particular reef.",,,,,,,,,36,0,0,0,22,0,38,,,1748-9326,,,,,,,,,,,"CSIRO Oceans & Atmosphere, Hobart, Tas, Australia",,,,2016-03-01,WOS:000373401400026,,

Extensive oil and gas extraction has occurred in wetland habitats along the northern Gulf of Mexico coast since the early 1900s. Activities involved with three-dimensional (3D) seismic exploration for these resources cause various disturbances to vegetation and soils. We documented the impact of a 3D seismic survey in coastal marshes in Louisiana, USA, along transects established before exploration began. Two semi-impounded marshes dominated by Spartina patens were in the area surveyed. Vegetation, soil, and water physicochemical data were collected before the survey, about 6 weeks following its completion, and every 3 months thereafter for 2 years. Soil cores for seed bank emergence experiments were also collected. Maximum vegetation height at impact sites was reduced in both marshes 6 weeks following the survey. In one marsh, total vegetation cover was also reduced, and dead vegetation cover increased, at impact sites 6 weeks after the survey. These effects, however, did not persist 3 months later.

However, restoration of drained peatlands has gained much importance over the last three decades, mostly due to the multiple ecosystem services they provide such as carbon storage, habitat provision and water flow regulation. Although there has been an increased focus on such ecosystems, spatial research on hydrophysical soil properties following rewetting in coastal mires is lacking. Therefore, the objectives of the study were to understand the spatial structures of hydrophysical properties of organic soils and spatial patterns of organic matter accumulation in relation to soil surface microtopography. Soil organic matter content (SOM) and hydraulic conductivity (K-s) of topsoils (0-28 cm), along with soil textures of the underlying mineral substrate, were investigated in a rewetted non-tidal coastal flood mire (Baltic Sea). The results indicate that the organic horizon with its relatively low K-s acts as a hydrological barrier to infiltration. Soil organic matter content (SOM), K-s and soil surface microtopography are all spatially auto-correlated within 100, 87 and 53 m, respectively. Bivariate Moran's I revealed a positive but weak spatial correlation between SOM and K-s and a moderately strong negative spatial correlation between SOM and soil surface microtopography. A map of SOM was generated using simple kriging, which predicts higher SOM in the centre of the ecosystem, at lower elevations; and lower SOM at the edges of the study area, at higher elevations. Local depressions in the centre of the ecosystem provide a wetter and therefore more anaerobic environment, thereby decreasing carbon mineralisation rates and enabling peat accumulation. The low hydraulic conductivity of the degraded peat in the presence of lower micro-elevations in the centre of the ecosystem is likely to increase the residence time of floodwater and thus may enhance (new) peat accumulation. Thus, we conclude that, for the restoration of non-tidal coastal mires where flooding events are not as frequent, K-s and soil surface microtopography are even more important factors to consider than for tidal systems.",,,,,,,,,8,0,0,0,6,0,8,,,1819-754X,,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Rostock, Fac Agr & Environm Sci, Soil Phys, Rostock, GermanyUniv Rostock, Fac Agr & Environm Sci, Geodesy & Geoinformat, Rostock, GermanyUniv Oulu, Water Energy & Environm Engn Res Unit, Oulu, Finland",,,,2020-03-16,WOS:000517603000001,,

Moreover, the forecasted large scale deployment of offshore renewable energy systems in deep water will rely upon similar mooring systems. Mooring lines are safety-critical systems on offshore floating and semi-submersible platforms. The lines are usually subject to immense environmental and structural forces such as currents, oceans waves, and hurricanes. Other forces include impact with the seabed, abrasion, increased drag due to accumulation of marine organisms and salt water corrosion. Failure of one or more of mooring lines can result in disastrous consequences for safety, the environment and production. Mooring chain life can be significantly reduced, leading to unacceptable risk of catastrophic failure, if early damage is not detected. Chain mounted equipment is available to monitor chain tension and bending, but detection of damage caused by stress concentrations, fatigue, corrosion and fretting or combinations of these is not currently possible. The Ultrasonic Guided Waves (UGW) and Acoustic Emission (AE) techniques are capable of detecting cracks in mooring chains and fatigue damage.

Estimating the quantity of dispersed crude oil defecated by planktonic copepods,,,,,,,,ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION,,,,208,,,,645,654,,,,10.1016/j.envpol.2015.10.041,,,,,,,Article,JAN 2016,2016,"We investigated and quantified defecation rates of crude oil by 3 species of marine planktonic copepods (Temora turbinata, Acartia tonsa, and Parvocalanus crassirostris) and a natural copepod assemblage after exposure to mechanically or chemically dispersed crude oil. Between 88 and 100% of the analyzed fecal pellets from three species of copepods and a natural copepod assemblage exposed for 48 h to physically or chemically dispersed light crude oil contained crude oil droplets. Crude oil droplets inside fecal pellets were smaller (median diameter: 2.4-3.5 mu m) than droplets in the physically and chemically dispersed oil emulsions (median diameter: 6.6 and 8.0 mu m, respectively). This suggests that copepods can reject large crude oil droplets or that crude oil droplets are broken into smaller oil droplets before or during ingestion. Depending on the species and experimental treatments, crude oil defecation rates ranged from 5.3 to 245 ng-oil copepod(-1) d(-1), which represent a mean weight-specific defecation rate of 0.026 mu g-oil mu g-C-copepod(1) d(-1). Considering a dispersed crude oil concentration commonly found in the water column after oil spills (1 mu l L-1) and copepod abundances in high productive coastal areas, copepods may defecate similar to 1.3-2.6 mg-oil m(-3) d(-1), which would represent similar to 0.15%-0.30% of the total dispersed oil per day. Our results indicate that ingestion and subsequent defecation of crude oil by planktonic copepods has a small influence on the overall mass of oil spills in the short term, but may be quantitatively important in the flux of oil from surface water to sediments and in the transfer of low-solubility, toxic petroleum hydrocarbons into food webs after crude oil spills in the sea.

During the initial stages of the 'Late Jurassic' offshore exploration, various oil fields and a few gas fields were discovered of which only one, the F3-FB field, proved to be economically viable. In the Northern Offshore of the Netherlands, latest Middle Jurassic (Callovian) - earliest Cretaceous (Ryazanian) strata are mostly limited to the Dutch Central Graben and Terschelling basins. Outside the Dutch Central Graben and the Terschelling Basin only thin veneers of these strata occur on the fringing highs such as the Schill Grund High and the Step Graben. The geology of this non-marine to shallow marine succession is complex. The combination of lateral facies changes, repetitive log and facies characteristics in time, sea-level and climate changes, salt tectonics and structural compartmentalisation hamper straightforward seismic interpretation and log correlation. The large number of lithostratigraphic units defined in the Stratigraphic Nomenclature of the Netherlands illustrates the complexity of this time-interval. In recent years, new biostratigraphic techniques and newly acquired stratigraphic data led to the identification of a series of events which can be related to the tectonic, climatic, environmental and stratigraphic development of the 'Late Jurassic' in the Dutch Central Graben and Terschelling basins. Based on these data, three stratigraphic sequences can be recognized. Sequence 1 (Callovian - earliest Kimmeridgian) records the initiation of the Dutch Central Graben, Sequence 2 (early Kimmeridgian - early Portlandian) that of the initiation of the Terschelling Basin. During sequence 3 (late Portlandian - Ryazanian) the Dutch offshore was draped by a regional transgression. These insights have directly impact on the exploration potential, which is discussed in two play concepts. The first is a strat-trap play in the fluvial/paralic sediments of Sequence 1 in the tows between the graben boundary and salt domes. The second example is the Spiculite play, which comprises a bioctastic sandstone reservoir at the top of a dome with a 4-way dip closure. These two examples highlight the necessity of understanding the paleoenvironment and geography for assessing the future exploration potential.",,,,,,,,,20,0,0,0,6,0,20,,,0016-7746,,,,,,,,,,,"Geol Survey Netherlands, TNO B&O, NL-3508 TA Utrecht, Netherlands",,,,2006-09-01,WOS:000241760500003,,

However, not all of this sandstone is good quality reservoir, and so the sedimentary facies are critical to prediction of reservoir in the area. Based on an analysis of logs, core, outcrop and seismic data, a new hypothesis is proposed for the Donghetang Formation as a 2nd or 3rd order stratigraphic sequence (SQ_Ddh), formed between unconformities Tg22 (top) and Tg3 (bottom), consisting of local transgressive (braided delta deposits) and extensive high-stand (foreshore and shoreface deposits) system tracts. Through networked seismic data, integrated with erosion and decompaction correction, the palaeogeomorphology during development of SQ_Ddh has been reconstructed and several geomorphological units can be distinguished. The sedimentary facies and distribution of SQ_Ddh were related closely to the depositional geomorphology. Between the margin of the northern paleo-uplift zone and the northwestern and northeastern depressions there developed braided deltas during the period of the early TST, and wave-dominated shorelines during the HST period when extensive shorefaces developed across the central low-uplift zone. Beyond the southeastern shoreline, there developed offshore and marine-shelf deposits. The foreshore and delta-front mouth bar sandstones constitute the most favorable reservoir, surrounding the paleo-uplift and the marginal uplift zones. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Tidal energy will arguably play a critical role in the renewable energy portfolio as it is both predictable and reliable, and can be put in place across the globe. However, installation may impact the local and regional ecology via changes in tidal dynamics, sediment transport pathways or bathymetric changes. In order to mitigate these effects, tidal energy devices need to be modelled, to predict hydrodynamic changes. Robust mesh generation is a fundamental component required for developing simulations with high accuracy. However, mesh generation for coastal domains can be an elaborate procedure. Here, we describe an approach combining mesh generators with Geographical Information Systems. We demonstrate robustness and efficiency by constructing a mesh with which to examine the potential environmental impact of a tidal turbine farm installation in the Orkney Islands. The mesh is then used with two well-validated ocean models, to compare their flow predictions with and without a turbine array. The results demonstrate that it is possible to create an easy-to-use tool to generate high-quality meshes for combined coastal engineering, here tidal turbines, and coastal ocean simulations.

Although generally considered to offer a low risk of major leakage, it remains relevant to establish the possible consequences for marine organisms that live in or on sediments overlying these storage areas if such an event may occur. The present study has used a series of laboratory exposures and behavioral bioassays to establish the sensitivity of Arctica islandica to simulated leakages of CO2. This long-lived bivalve mollusc is widely distributed throughout the North Sea, an area where geological storage is currently taking place and where there are plans to expand this operation significantly. A recently published model has predicted a maximum drop of 1.9 pH units in seawater at the point source of a substantial escape of CO2 from sub-sea geological storage in this region. Valve movements of A. islandica exposed to reduced pH seawater were recorded continuously using Hall effect proximity sensors. Valve movement regulation is important for optimising the flow of water over the gills, which supplies food and facilitates respiration. A stepwise reduction in seawater pH showed an initial increase in both the rate and extent of valve movements in the majority of individuals tested when pH fell to 6.2 units. Exposing A. islandica to pH 6.2 seawater continuously for seven days resulted in a clear increase in valve movements during the first 40 h of exposure, followed by a gradual reduction in activity intensity over the subsequent five days, suggesting acclimation. The ability of both exposed and control bivalves to burrow successfully into sediment on completion of this exposure was very similar. A final exposure trial, testing whether increased valve movements initiated by reduced pH were related to foot extension during attempted burrowing, found no such association. In summary, significant changes in valve behavior did not occur until seawater pH fell to 6.2 units. The response took the form of an increase in valve activity rather than closure. The absence of foot extension coincident with increased valve movements indicates A. islandica were not attempting to burrow, leaving the possibility that valve movements are supporting a respiratory response to hypercapnia. In conclusion, A. islandica appears to be tolerant of reductions in seawater pH equivalent to those predicted for substantial losses of CO2 through leakage from sub-sea geological storage.

Among the numerous environmental issues associated with the dyke construction, it has been of special interest whether the tidal flats in the most reentrant area, Daehangri, just outside the beginning part of the dyke will actively grow or not. This lies in the center of the arguments about positive/negative functions of the dyke.Field measurements, concentrated on hydrodynamics within the bottom boundary layer, and sediment-transport evaluations were conducted in the coastal areas around the Daehangri tidal flats to examine sediment transport and thus source-sink relationships of sediments therein. Deployments of autonomous benthic instruments, TISDOS, during 1-3 weeks indicate that the nearshore sands and muds are transported toward the dyke, whereas sands on tidal flats and beaches are transported from the dyke along the shoreline. Most of the nearshore sediments eventually deposit to form a shallow shoal near the Garyuk opening located in the opposite direction to the Dachangri tidal flats. The rates of sediment transport increase greatly by high waves as compared to those caused by even spring peak tidal currents alone. As a result, the scheme of sediment transport over the study area clearly rules out the Daehangri tidal flats from the newly forming, active sinks of the nearshore sediments triggered artificially by the construction of the Saemangeum dyke.

In order to prevent these damages and losses, it is necessary to do a proper understanding of these accidents. Offshore systems as of the main parts of ocean structures and their accidents are considered here in this paper. From 1975 some data showing offshore accidents are captured in the Worldwide Offshore Accident Databank (WOAD), which are the main data bank to be used in this study. These data are about offshore damages and collapses due to Fires, Blowout, Anchor failure, Capsize, Explosion, etc.The main scope of the study is on fixed offshores, named jackets which are used in the Persian Gulf for oil production. Fire is considered here and a mathematical model for fire distribution is derived. Heat transfer within the structure in three different ways including: radiation, convection, and conduction will be considered. Surrounded environmental winds, waves, earthquakes and others strengthen the heat flux and its effects on the structure. In this research a jacket named Forozan, located in the Persian Gulf, loaded under gravitational effects of the fixed parts and moving parts, while considering environmental like winds, waves, etc is considered, if fire is distributed at the main top deck. Finite element analysis, using ANSYS is performed to derive thermal stresses and strains in the structural members of the jacket, and the results will show how to modify the weak point in the structure to prevent collapses and damages.",,,,,Oceans '04 MTS/IEEE Techno-Ocean '04 ConferenceOceans '04 MTS/IEEE Techno-Ocean '04 Conference,"NOV 09-12, 2004NOV 09-12, 2004",IEEE; OES; TON; JAMSTEC; Korea Convent Vis Assoc; AESTO; CEROSIEEE; OES; TON; JAMSTEC; Korea Convent Vis Assoc; AESTO; CEROS,"Kobe, JAPANKobe, JAPAN",1,0,0,0,0,0,1,,,,,0-7803-8669-8,,,,,,,,,"Sharif Univ Technol, Dept Mech Engn, Tehran, Iran",,,,2004-01-01,WOS:000227674100041,,

Here, a synthesis of delta C-13 measurements taken from foraminifera in marine sediment cores over the last 150 000 years is presented. The dataset comprises previously published and unpublished data from benthic and planktonic records throughout the global ocean. Data are placed on a common delta O-18 age scale suitable for examining orbital timescale variability but not millennial events, which are removed by a 10 ka filter. Error estimates account for the resolution and scatter of the original data, and uncertainty in the relationship between delta C-13 of calcite and of dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) in seawater. This will assist comparison with delta C-13 of DIC output from models, which can be further improved using model outputs such as temperature, DIC concentration, and alkalinity to improve estimates of fractionation during calcite formation.High global deep ocean delta C-13, indicating isotopically heavy carbon, is obtained during Marine Isotope Stages (MIS) 1, 3, 5a, c and e, and low delta C-13 during MIS 2, 4 and 6, which are temperature minima, with larger amplitude variability in the Atlantic Ocean than the Pacific Ocean. This is likely to result from changes in biosphere carbon storage, modulated by changes in ocean circulation, productivity, and air-sea gas exchange. The North Atlantic vertical delta C-13 gradient is greater during temperature minima than temperature maxima, attributed to changes in the spatial extent of Atlantic source waters. There are insufficient data from shallower than 2500 m to obtain a coherent pattern in other ocean basins. The data synthesis indicates that basin-scale delta C-13 during the last interglacial (MIS 5e) is not clearly distinguishable from the Holocene (MIS 1) or from MIS 5a and 5c, despite significant differences in ice volume and atmospheric CO2 concentration during these intervals. Similarly, MIS 6 is only distinguishable from MIS 2 or 4 due to globally lower delta C-13 values both in benthic and planktonic data. This result is obtained despite individual records showing differences between these intervals, indicating that care must be used in interpreting large scale signals from a small number of records.",,,,,,,,,61,1,0,0,12,0,66,,,1814-9324,1814-9332,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Southampton, Natl Oceanog Ctr Southampton, Sch Ocean & Earth Sci, Southampton SO14 3ZH, Hants, EnglandOpen Univ, Dept Earth & Environm Sci, Milton Keynes MK7 6AA, Bucks, EnglandUniv Cambridge, Dept Earth Sci, Cambridge CB2 2EQ, EnglandUniv Oxford, Dept Earth Sci, Oxford OX1 3PR, England",,,,2010-01-01,WOS:000283667900007,,

This accident, if considered as a complete historical event, is the lens through which the entire sea trading structure and its hazards, on a major navigation axis, stands revealed. The salvaging of the goods scattered along the shore, under the supervision of admiralty officers, gives us a glimpse of the populations of these coastal fringes. Their behaviour, too often and too summarily restricted to the sole plundering function, is far more complex, and includes an awareness of a new legislation favourable to salvagers, which led to a gradual decline of vessel looting at the end of the 18th century The shipwreck event is more than a great romantic theme, its evocative pictorial representations cannot account for the full complexity of a phenomenon involving not only the crews, but also the coastal population, and the representatives of the Crown.",,,,,,,,,2,0,0,0,0,0,2,,,0399-0826,,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Bretagne Sud Loreint, CERHIO UMR 6258, Loreint, France",Univ Bretagne Sud Loreint,,,2010-12-27,WOS:000283886300006,,

Aerial photographs from three regions were examined, including the South Coast, from Cape Arid to Esperance; the Central West Coast, between Guilderton and Dongara; and the Ningaloo Coast, from Point Cloates to Exmouth.The landforms were broadly classified according to morphological and genetic criteria, such as growth mechanism, degree of mobility, contemporary activity/processes, main processes involved in the supply of material, sources of supply, conditions of wave regime and stage of development. Second, morphometric information was taken directly from the aerial photographs. Following work reported by SILVESTER and HSU (1993), this was analysed to determine the constant and exponential values in the curvilinear relationship between the length of the offshore structure relative to its distance offshore and the difference between offshore distance and the ratio of salient protrusion to island length. Separate graphs have been compiled for all observations from Western Australia as well as for each region to indicate geographic differences. An examination of the geometric differences between each coastal region was undertaken using analysis of variance techniques. At the 5% significance level, the results indicated that, there are significant differences between the coastal regions for most ratios when tombolos are excluded from the data sets. Most of the South Coast forelands and tombolos are formed by the deposition of sediment resulting from the convergence of swell behind an obstacle, whereas on the Central West and Ningaloo Coasts the submerged reef provide an offshore barrier. Swell is complexly diffracted and refracted by the reefs and sediment is deposited in a less predictable manner. Flushing of lagoonal waters behind the reef either by longshore cut-rents or offshore movement of water through breaks in the reefs appears to impede the formation of tombolos and provides an explanation for travelling versus stationary forms in the respective environments.It has been shown that the development of these forms cannot be attributable to the length of the offshore obstacle or the distance of the obstacle offshore. Explanation of this requires further investigation of the combined oceanographic processes occurring leeward of the reef chains on the Central West Coast and on the Ningaloo Coast.",,,,,Carter Memorial SymposiumCarter Memorial Symposium,19941994,,"SAN FRANCISCO, CASAN FRANCISCO, CA",44,0,0,0,5,0,44,,,0749-0208,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1996-06-01,WOS:A1996UY92900019,,

Back trajectories and wind dependent and PCA analyses showed that the marine sources included ship traffic emissions and corrosive stainless steels from the equipment at the platform as well as industrial emissions from stainless steel production and coal combustion sources, which were transported from the surrounding mainland. Both contributed greatly to the ambient metallic particles at the offshore platform.

A controlled short-term field experiment was performed to investigate the effects of sound exposure from a seismic airgun on the physiology and behaviour of two socioeconomically and ecologically important marine fishes: the Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) and saithe (Pollachius virens). Biologgers recording heart rate and body temperature and acoustic transmitters recording locomotory activity (i.e. acceleration) and depth were used to monitor free-swimming individuals during experimental sound exposures (18-60 dB above ambient). Fish were held in a large sea cage (50 m diameter; 25 m depth) and exposed to sound exposure trials over a 3-day period. Concurrently, the behaviour of untagged cod and saithe was monitored using video recording. The cod exhibited reduced heart rate (bradycardia) in response to the particle motion component of the sound from the airgun, indicative of an initial flight response. No behavioural startle response to the airgun was observed; both cod and saithe changed both swimming depth and horizontal position more frequently during sound production. The saithe became more dispersed in response to the elevated sound levels. The fish seemed to habituate both physiologically and behaviourally with repeated exposure. In conclusion, the sound exposures induced over the time frames used in this study appear unlikely to be associated with long-term alterations in physiology or behaviour.

Overfishing and other human influences are reducing the diversity and abundance of fish worldwide, but the ecosystem-level consequences of these changes have not been assessed quantitatively. Recycling of nutrients is one important ecosystem process that is directly influenced by fish. Fish species vary widely in the rates at which they excrete nitrogen and phosphorus; thus, altering fish communities could affect nutrient recycling. Here, we use extensive field data on nutrient recycling rates and population sizes of fish species in a Neotropical river and Lake Tanganyika, Africa, to evaluate the effects of simulated extinctions on nutrient recycling. in both of these species-rich ecosystems, recycling was dominated by relatively few species, but contributions of individual species differed between nitrogen and phosphorus. Alternative extinction scenarios produced widely divergent patterns. Loss of the species targeted by fishermen led to faster declines in nutrient recycling than extinctions in order of rarity, body size, or trophic position. However, when surviving species were allowed to increase after extinctions, these compensatory responses had strong moderating effects even after losing many species. Our results underscore the complexity of predicting the consequences of extinctions from species-rich animal communities. Nevertheless, the importance of exploited species in nutrient recycling suggests that overfishing could have particularly detrimental effects on ecosystem functioning.",,,,,,,,,236,1,0,0,218,4,275,,,0027-8424,,,,,,,,,,,"Cornell Univ, Dept Ecol & Evolut Biol, Ithaca, NY 14853 USAMiami Univ, Dept Zool, Oxford, OH 45056 USA",,,,2007-03-13,WOS:000244972700040,17360546,

The investigation was carried out through a series of centrifuge model tests. The results demonstrate that the pullout capacity of the fish dynamically installed anchor (DIA) subjected to cyclic loading is dependent on the combination of cyclic mean load, cyclic load amplitude, and number of cycles. A design contour is proposed for estimating the anchor capacity under various magnitudes of cyclic load. The evolution of anchor displacement, inclination, and excess pore pressure are quantified and their influences on the fish DIA capacity are highlighted. With a tip embedment depth of 1.02-1.43 times the anchor length during dynamic installation, the fish DIA was found to dive in calcareous silt for mooring mudline inclinations <= 45 degrees under both monotonic and cyclic operational loadings, whereas by contrast, the OMNI-Max anchor with tip embedment of 1.4-2 times the anchor length did not dive for inclinations as low as 1 degrees-10 degrees. As such, the fish DIA has the potential for efficient anchoring to allow economic development of oil and gas reserves in deep water with calcareous seabed sediments.

NGH is widely distributed in onshore tundra and shallow sedimentary layers in the deep sea. These sedimentary layers typically exit shallow burial depth, poor diagenesis and low strength characteristics: moreover, the decomposition of NGH can also greatly reduce reservoir strength. Therefore, NGH development can easily causes many geomechanical problems, including reservoir instability, sand production and seabed landslides, etc., which may further trigger a series of environmental disasters such as tsunamis, natural gas leakage and the acceleration of global warming. This study mainly reviews the research progress regarding geomechanical issues in NGH development, including mechanical properties of NGH-bearing sediments, borehole stability, hydraulic fracturing, sand production, reservoir settlement and seabed landslides. In addition to previous research achievements regarding geomechanical problems in NGH exploitation, the limitations and challenges arc also discussed, and several questions and insightful suggestions are put forward for future research from our point of view.

Ten metals were examined and the results showed that zinc, mercury and copper were abundant in the water samples taken from the reactor and in significantly higher concentrations compared to the US EPA CMC (criterion maximum concentration) criterion. Moreover, nickel and lead were found in concentrations higher than the CCC (criterion constant concentration) criterion set by the US EPA for clean seawater.

However, due to the unplanned nature of catastrophes, studies aimed to identify the effects of these accidents on an ecosystem and its inhabitants often have imperfect study designs that are reactive rather than proactive, resulting in methodological and analytical challenges. On 20 April 2010, following an explosion on the Deepwater Horizon oil rig, a well blowout occurred on the seafloor approximately 80 km off the Louisiana coast in the Gulf of Mexico. This blowout resulted in the largest marine oil spill in United States history, which impacted critical migratory stopover and overwintering habitat for many seabird and shorebird species, including species of high conservation concern such as the piping plover (Charadrius melodus). Here, we assessed the potential longer-term demographic impacts of the Deepwater Horizon oil spill on piping plovers in a capture-mark-recapture framework. We examined whether a series of demographic processes, including probabilities of remaining at a specific wintering site, over-winter and annual apparent survival, winter stopover duration, and abundance varied among oiled and unoiled habitats. We found that the perceived amount of oiling on land, in water, and on individual birds, as well as numerous demographic processes, were spatially or temporally variable. However, we found little support that piping plover demography was negatively influenced by the magnitude of oil observed at an impacted area, or that demographic rates substantially varied between reference and oil impacted areas. Nor did we find that piping plovers that were observed to be oiled had lower survival probabilities following the DWH oil spill relative to non-oiled individuals from the same winter population. Although we did not find that the Deepwater Horizon oil spill substantially influenced piping plovers, our methods provide an analytical framework to more appropriately address both the near or long-term impacts of an anthropogenic disturbance on a species.",,,,,,,,,12,0,0,0,11,0,13,,,0006-3207,1873-2917,,,,,,,,,,"Virginia Polytech Inst & State Univ, Dept Fish & Wildlife Conservat, Blacksburg, VA 24060 USAUS Fish & Wildlife Serv, South Carolina Field Off, Charleston, SC 29407 USASUNY Coll Environm Sci & Forestry, Dept Environm & Forest Biol, Syracuse, NY 13210 USAPOB 1359, Buxton, NC 27920 USA",,,,2017-08-22,WOS:000407186000006,,

The application of dispersants enhances the transport of oil as small droplets into the water column, and when combined with the turbulence of I m waves will quickly entrain oil into the top 1 m of the water column, where it rapidly dilutes to concentrations less than 100 ppm. In less than 24 h, the dispersed oil is expected to mix into the top 10 m of the water column and be diluted to concentrations well below 10 ppm, with dilution continuing as time proceeds. Over the multiple weeks that biodegradation takes place, dispersed oil concentrations are expected to be below 1 ppm. Measurements from spills and wave basin studies support these calculations. Published laboratory studies focused on the quantification of contaminant biodegradation rates have used concentrations orders of magnitude greater than this, as it was necessary to ensure the concentrations of hydrocarbons and other chemicals were higher than the detection limits of chemical analysis. However, current analytical methods can quantify individual alkanes and PAHs (and their alkyl homologues) at ppb and ppm levels. To simulate marine biodegradation of dispersed oil at dilute concentrations commonly encountered in the field, laboratory studies should be conducted at similarly low hydrocarbon concentrations.

Atlantic bluefin tuna migration and aggregation are related to oceanographic fronts and to the distribution of their prey. Spawning stock biomass (SSB) shows an initial steep and steady decline from 1970 to the mid-1980s and relative stability since then; with indications of a possible slight increase in recent years. Under the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT) low recruitment scenario, western Atlantic bluefin tuna is not overfished; under the ICCAT high recruitment scenario western Atlantic bluefin tuna is overfished. Fishery catch per unit of effort (CPUE) information indicates that local abundance of Atlantic bluefin tuna off southwestern Nova Scotia and in the southern Gulf of St. Lawrence is high in recent years. The proposed recovery target for abundance is to increase spawning stock biomass compared to 2012. ICCAT projections suggest that the 2025 SSB would be equal to or larger than the 2012 SSB for total allowable catches (TACs) of 2,250 metric tonnes (mt) or less. The proposed distribution target for recovery is to maintain habitat conditions allowing for a broad distribution in Canadian waters. The National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) of the USA concluded that there is a low probability of extinction at the TAC agreed for 2011 and 2012 (1,750 mt). Fishing is the only documented source of human induced mortality. Other potential sources are anthropogenic noise and oil and gas exploration and exploitation. Potential threats to habitat include overfishing of prey species, global climate change, and anthropogenic noise. Feasible mitigation measures to minimize the threat posed from fishing could include a reduction or elimination of landings of Atlantic bluefin tuna in directed fisheries or as a bycatch in other fisheries, and measures to increase the post-release survival of any Atlantic bluefin tuna released. Given that the proposed recovery target is an increase in SSB compared to 2012, maximum allowable harm was agreed to be the maximum removals by the fishery that would still result in the SSB in 2025 being greater than the SSB in 2012.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Centre for Science Advice (CSA), Maritimes Region, Fisheries and Oceans Canada, Box 1006, Stn.

Proceedings of a seminar of the National Committee for biology 1st and 2nd April 2003.",,,,,,,,171,192,,,,,,,,,,,Book chapter; Meeting paper,2004,2004,"In recent years, in the Galapagos Archipelago, faster and more frequent forms of transport linked to 'improved' infrastructure have been introduced to satisfy the demands of residents and the tourist industry. These have led to direct effects on endemic species, such as land iguanas and terrestrial birds, that often display the same ecological naivete to vehicular transport as they do to humans and introduced predators. While the ecological impact of these effects of transport still require further research, the levels of impact and ecological roles of the species affected are beginning to cause concern. Bulk transport of petroleum products and discharges to the marine environment through shipwrecks have been documented for two major incidents in recent years. Fortunately, the effects were extremely localised due to favourable weather conditions but recent evidence from long-term research on marine iguanas indicates that the effects may be more serious and more subtle than was at first thought, especially in a species already under periodic stress from natural factors caused by the El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO). Oceanic islands ecosystems are amongst the most vulnerable to the effects of alien species. While the Galapagos Archipelago (Ecuador) is still considered to be the most intact of these ecosystems in the world, alien species are considered to be the greatest threat to the unique biodiversity of these islands. The facilitation role of transport in bringing alien species to the Galapagos is clear. Transport in Galapagos also plays a key facilitation role in the legal and illegal exploitation of natural resources with the terrestrial and marine protected areas of Galapagos. Large scale removal of tortoises, to feed crews of whaling ships, took place during the 1800s and left the populations weakened condition to resist competition from subsequently introduced herbivores. In the Galapagos Marine Reserve a recent rise in the number and speed of newer forms of fishing vessels has led to dramatic increases in the harvesting of some marine resources, particularly sea cucumbers.

Marine CO2 emissions accounts for around 3% of the total CO2 emission worldwide and grows rapidly with increasing demand for passenger and cargo transport. The International Maritime Organization (IMO) has adopted mandatory measures to reduce greenhouse gases (GHGs) emissions from international shipping. This study aims to explore how to apply solvent-based post-combustion carbon capture (PCC) process to capture CO2 from the energy system in a typical cargo ship and to evaluate the cost degrees of different integration options through simulation-based techno-economic assessments. The selected reference cargo ship has a propulsion system consisting of two four-stroke reciprocating engines at a total power of 17 MW. The study first addressed the challenge on model development of the marine diesel engines and then developed the model of the ship energy system. The limitations of implementing onboard carbon capture were discussed. Two integration options between the ship energy system and the carbon capture process were simulated to analyse the thermal performance of the integrated system and to estimate equipment size of the carbon capture process. It was found that the carbon capture level could only reach 73% when the existing ship energy system is integrated with the PCC process due to limited heat and electricity supply for CCS. The cost of CO2 captured is around 77.50 epsilon/ton CO2. With installation of an additional gas turbine to provide extra energy utilities to the capture plant, the carbon capture level could reach 90% whilst the cost of CO2 captured is around 163.07 epsilon/ton CO2, mainly because of 21.41% more fuel consumption for the additional diesel gas turbine. This is the first systematical study in applying solvent-based carbon capture for ships, which will inspire other researchers in this area. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Winter survival is believed to be the single most important life-history trait in long-lived species but its determinants are largely unknown. Seabirds are inaccessible during this season, so conventional metabolic studies are extremely challenging and new approaches are needed. This paper describes and uses a state-of-the-art mechanistic model, Niche Mapper (TM), to predict energy expenditure and food requirements of the two main seabird species wintering in the northwest Atlantic. We found that energy demand increased throughout the winter phase in both species. Across this period, mean estimated daily energy requirements were 1306 kJ day(-1) for Brunnich's guillemots (Uria lomvia) and 430 kJ day(-1) for little auks (Alle alle) wintering off Greenland and Newfoundland. Mean estimated daily food requirements were 547 g wet food day(-1) for Brunnich's guillemots, and 289 g wet food day(-1) for little auks. For both species and both wintering sites, our model predicts a sharp increase in energy expenditure between November and December, primarily driven by climatic factors such as air temperature and wind speed. These findings strongly suggest the existence of an energetic bottleneck for North Atlantic seabirds towards the end of the year, a challenging energetic phase which might explain recurrent events of winter mass-mortality, so called 'seabird winter wrecks'. Our study therefore emphasizes the relevance of thermodynamics/biophysical modelling for investigating the energy balance of wintering marine top predators and its interplay with survival and population dynamics in the context of global change.",,,,,,,,,94,1,0,0,82,0,103,,,0022-0949,,,,,,,,,,,"CNRS, CEFE, UMR 5175, F-34293 Montpellier 5, FranceCNRS, DEPE, IPHC, F-67087 Strasbourg, FranceUniv Wisconsin, Dept Zool, Madison, WI 53706 USAUniv Cape Town, Percy FitzPatrick Inst, DST NRF Ctr Excellence, ZA-7701 Rondebosch, South Africa",,,,2009-08-01,WOS:000268136700030,19617442,

While habitat loss and destruction has severed connections between people and salmon in many locales, salmon fisheries in the high Arctic are just beginning to develop. To explore these emergent connections, we gathered local knowledge about Pacific salmon and emerging subsistence salmon fisheries in the Beaufort Sea region through ethnographic research in Utqiagvik (formerly Barrow) and Nuiqsut, Alaska. Between 2010 and 2013, we interviewed 41 active fishermen and Elders who generally agreed that harvests of Pacific salmon species have been increasing in recent years, beginning in the 1990s and early 2000s. About 46% of active fishermen and Elders who discussed salmon abundance perceived an increasing trend over time. Another 43% characterized salmon abundance as cyclical or perceived no directional trend over time. The remaining fishermen (all from Nuiqsut) expressed their perception of decreasing salmon and fish abundance overall related to oil and gas development impacts to their local lands and waters. Given these mixed perceptions and harvests being an imperfect proxy for abundance, it remains unclear whether salmon populations are expanding in Arctic river systems. However, research participants have identified new stream systems not currently documented in the scientific literature where salmon are present and thought to be spawning. In both communities, we found that many fishermen and Elders often do not differentiate Pacific salmon species. Fishermen in both communities are developing new knowledge of salmon and increasing their use of salmon as a subsistence resource, yet uncertainties in the current data and local knowledge combine to generate equivocal evidence that salmon abundance is increasing. This lack of a clear increase in salmon abundance provides nuance to a simple story that warming has led to the increases of salmon in the Arctic. Despite the uncertainty regarding abundance, it is clear we are witnessing an emergence of new salmon fisheries in the high Arctic, perceived to be one among a suite of environmental and social changes currently being experienced in this region.",,,,,,,,,17,0,0,0,13,0,21,,,0004-0843,1923-1245,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Alaska Fairbanks, Coll Fisheries & Ocean Sci, 1007 W 3rd Ave,Suite 100, Anchorage, AK 99501 USANorth Slope Borough, Dept Wildlife Management, POB 69, Utqiagvik, AK 99723 USAUniv Alaska Fairbanks, Inst Arctic Biol, 902 N Koyukuk Dr, Fairbanks, AK 99775 USAUniv Alaska Fairbanks, Coll Fisheries & Ocean Sci, 2150 Koyukuk Dr, Fairbanks, AK 99775 USA",North Slope Borough,,,2019-09-30,WOS:000485096400005,,

Species-specific oil rates reflect the risk for marine birds to become oiled at sea. High oil rates were characteristic for seabirds common in areas with frequent oil spills; low oil rates for birds wintering away from the busiest shipping lanes. Declining trends in oil-rates were found, reflecting a reduction in the amount of oil intentionally discharged over the past 50 years. Spatial patterns in the risk to become oiled could be identified, when the winter distribution patterns of the affected birds were incorporated in the analysis. Declines in oil rates were most pronounced in coastal birds. These trends were consistent with tendencies to police nearshore waters more effectively than offshore waters. While levels of chronic oil pollution are much reduced, future emphasis should be to reduce chronic oiling more effectively in offshore waters. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Due to their plasticity in foraging behavior, coupled with an increased availability of prey resources, these excursions may also represent opportunistic foraging explorations. Fisheries-independent surveys initiated by the Northwest Fisheries Science Center in 1998 first encountered Humboldt squid in coastal waters off central Oregon and Washington in 2004. Squid ranging from 36-79 cm mantle length were caught during the following six years of sampling (2004-2009), with individuals generally increasing in abundance shoreward in late summer. The highest observed densities were in 2009 and measured 1,671 squid (10(6) m(3))(-1). Physical features associated with increased squid catch included station depth, subsurface water temperature, ocean salinity, ocean density, and dissolved oxygen. In addition, the arrival of Humboldt squid onto the shelf in late summer was coincident with declines of juvenile (10-30 cm total length) Pacific hake (Merluccius productus), in contrast to the typical increases of hake recorded in late summer during recent years. Our results suggest that predator-prey interactions and ocean conditions in the CCS epipelagic zone lead to seasonal expansions, yet unsuccessful colonization attempts, by Humboldt squid populations.

However abundance estimates have not been available for many cetacean species inhabiting the coastal waters of Canada's Pacific coast, including those species that were heavily depleted by commercial whaling. Systematic sightings surveys were conducted in the inshore coastal waters of the Inside Passage, between the British Columbia (BC)-Washington and the BC-Alaska borders. A total of 4,400km (2,400 n.miles) of trackline were surveyed in the summers of 2004 and 2005. Abundance estimates (with 95% confidence intervals) assuming certain trackline detection for seven cetacean species were as follows: harbour porpoise, 9,120 (4,210-19,760); Dall's porpoise, 4,910 (2,700-8,940): Pacific white-sided dolphin, 25,900 (12,900-52,100); humpback whale, 1,310 (755-2,280); fin whale, 496 (201-1.220); common minke whale, 388 (222-680): and 'northern resident' killer whale, 161 (45-574). The potential for responsive movement to have affected the accuracy and precision of these estimates is difficult to assess in small-boat surveys. However, the analyses were designed to minimise this factor in the most obvious case (Pacific white-sided dolphins) and pilot data collection has begun to assess the magnitude of the effect and to calculate correction factors for other species. The density of harbour seals, both along the shoreline and at sea, was calculated and it was estimated that total abundance of harbour seals in the study area was at least 19,400 (14,900-25,200). These are new abundance estimates for this region for all cetacean species except killer whales. The small sample size makes the killer whale estimate tenuous, but one worth noting, as it is close to the known number of northern resident killer whales (2004 census was 219 animals, Cetacean Research Program, Pacific Biological Station, Fisheries and Oceans Canada). The common minke whale abundance estimate is similarly tentative, however the results do reveal that common minke whales were relatively rare in this region. While the majority of harbour seals were found as expected in the southern straits and in the mainland inlets, a substantial number of animals were on the north coast and in the Queen Charlotte Basin as well. These data provide a systematic snapshot of summertime distribution and abundance of marine mammals in the Queen Charlotte Basin, where offshore oil and gas development and seismic surveys for geophysical research have been proposed to take place. Similarly, the abundance estimates could be used to form the basis of a simulation exercise to assess the sustainability of observed levels of incidental bycatch of small cetaceans in commercial fisheries.

Maintenance operations for marine and offshore systems are carried out by the seafarers/operators and it is they who are usually liable for any error. Previous studies have identified that about 80% of marine and offshore accidents occurred due to human error. Therefore, to address this concern human reliability assessment (HRA) is very important. However, an appropriate technique is required to estimate human error probability (HEP) for marine and offshore systems. Human error assessment and reduction technique (HEART) is applied to many industries to determine HEP. Recently, HEART was specifically developed for the maintenance operations of marine and offshore systems considering marine and offshore environmental and operational conditions. However, there is a deficiency in this technique as it does not provide a concrete method to determine the seafarers assessed proportion of effect (SAPOE) and it therefore, relies heavily on the judgment of a single expert. This study proposes a hybrid HEART to overcome the problem. The hybrid HEART utilizes the evidence theory to fuse an expert's opinion to determine APOA for each corresponding error producing condition (EPC). The proposed technique is applied to estimate HEP for the maintenance procedures of a condensate pump for an offshore oil and gas facility as a case study. The HEP values are calculated for each selected activity and comparison is provided. Based on the results, a performing pressure test and isolation leak test has the highest HEP 1.54E-01 and depressurizing drain lines has the lowest 1.54E-04.

The glider is powered by batteries recharged by solar photovoltaic panels and propelled by wave action, so that long unmanned missions can be achieved at very low cost. The glider can travel along programmed transects for months-long deployments collecting meteorological and ocean data and recording and identifying species that make sounds in the ocean soundscape, including both the natural (geophony and biophony) and anthropogenic (anthropophony) sounds. Some of the species that can be studied with the acoustic sensors on this glider include the endangered Atlantic sturgeon, red drum, striped bass, groupers, bluefin tuna, sharks, endangered right whales and bottlenose dolphins. The instrument package on the glider will allow multiple and simultaneous measurements of the ocean environment (waves using a Datawell MOSE-G1000 wave sensor; currents using a Teledyne RDI Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler; temperature, salinity, depth and dissolved oxygen using a Sea-Bird CTD+DO sensor; and turbidity and phytoplankton abundance using a Turner C-3 pumped fluorometer) and near-surface weather (air temperature, rainfall, wind speed using an Airmar 200WX Weather Station) during missions. An acoustic tag receiver (Vemco VR2C sensor) will be used to detect and track acoustically tagged animals, and a recording hydrophone and analysis system (Decimus PAMBuoy sensor) will record sounds produced by marine animals and classify them. The glider will be used to monitor areas for the presence of sound-producing animals, to avoid noise and other impacts to threatened species in shipping and transportation corridors, to identify and protect fishing areas, and to assess impacts to areas proposed for wave and wind energy development, sand mining areas, and oil and gas leases. Data reports will be relayed from all the glider sensors to land-based computers via satellite and mobile phone modems in near-real-time for analysis, mapping and archival. Our overarching objective with the Acoustic Wave Glider is to document ocean habitats and biologic communities in continental shelf and slope waters to determine static communities (e.g., reefs) and migratory pathways of highly mobile species (e.g., fishes, marine mammals, sea turtles). Secondary objectives include providing data to oceanographers on environmental conditions during normal conditions and storm events to enhance storm prediction models. Storms and rainfall events can be analyzed for their impacts on ocean communities through acoustic analysis of organism responses. Storm events often cannot be sampled by vessels due to danger to life and equipment, but wave gliders are specifically designed to survive and report ambient ocean conditions, even during storm sea states and hurricanes. The glider will be featured at public displays of research at the NC aquariums, including static displays and interactive touch screens of glider tracks are planned. Scientific forums, seminars, and other public events will be scheduled, and glider users will be encouraged to write public interest articles about mission results for news media and magazines.

However, these models do not predict how a species may react to that noise. In this paper, the results from a modified predictive underwater noise model and a hydrodynamic model are used in an individual based model (IBM) to predict the impacts on cod (Gadhus moruha) from noise generated during a pile driving event at an offshore wind farm in Liverpool Bay, UK. The model included cod which were sensitive to noise and those which were insensitive ('deaf'). Fish movement was from the outer bay into the Dee Estuary, a known feeding ground. The IBM indicated that the cod which could hear took up to 7 days longer to reach their destination than the cod which were deaf. This technique could be used during the consenting process for offshore projects to better understand the potential impact on marine species. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Global emissions reductions on the gigatonne scale using CCS will require regional or basin-scale deployment of CO2 storage in saline aquifers. Thus the evaluation of both the dynamic and ultimate CO2 storage capacity of formations is important for policy makers to determine the viability of CCS as a pillar of the greenhouse gas mitigation strategy in a particular region. We use a reservoir simulation model representing the large-scale Bunter Sandstone in the UK Southern North Sea to evaluate the dynamics and sensitivities of regional CO2 plume transport and storage. At the basin-scale, we predict hydrogeological changes in the storage reservoir in response to multiple regional carbon sequestration development scenarios. We test the sensitivity of injection capacity to a range of target CO2 injection rates and fluctuations in CO2 supply. Model sensitivities varying the target injection rates indicate that in the absence of pressure management up to 3.7 Gt of CO2 can be stored in the Bunter region over 50 years given the pressure constraints set to avoid fracturing the formation. Long-term (approx. 1000 years), our results show that up to 16 Gt of CO2 can be stored in the Bunter region without pressure management. With pressure management, the estimate rises to 32 Gt. However, consideration must be given to the additional operational and economic requirements of pressure management using brine production. (C) 2017 The Authors.

According to a survey on the ecological characteristics of Halimeda in the Laolongtou breaker zone of Shidao Island in the Xisha Islands, the green and white living Halimeda are collected, the isotopic ages of C-14 contained in the Halimeda are shown to be 27 years and 55 years, respectively, and carbonate mainly occurs in five types, i.e., luster, segment, sand, sand grain, and marl in the formation. The Halimeda segments mainly provide the carbonate sediments of long-term biogenic deposits in the reef environment and the annual productivity per area is 60-100 g/m(2); the characteristics of the microstructure of the Halimeda are analyzed, the aragonite raphide carbonate is deposited and enriched in the cortexes, medullas and cysts, and the Halimeda generally contain major elements such as C, O, Ca, Cl, Mg, K, Na, S and Al, and are rich in trace elements such as tellurium (Te), rhodium (Rh) and strontium. It is believed that the Halimeda grow slowly, including the biotic community of reef corals in the reef areas, thus they possess an environmental remediation capacity, but it takes much time to remedy the environment, and it is necessary to make the law to protect the diversity and vulnerability of the Xisha marine ecology, the ecology of the reef community and the island environment in a scientific way. As indicated in the survey, under the background of global warming and sea-level rise, the discovery of large amounts of Halimeda in the Laolongtou sea area is significant for the natural increase of the depleted atoll system of the Xuande Atoll, while the Halimeda segments represent the primary form of the fossil Halimeda, of which the species can be identified and preserved in great numbers under geological conditions. The Miocene was discovered in large amounts in the Xichen-1 well, therefore the study on the characteristics and mechanism of Halimeda carbonate sediments plays a pivotal role in the formation and construction of organic reefs in the South China Sea as well as oil and gas exploration.",,,,,,,,,7,4,0,0,2,0,10,,,0253-505X,1869-1099,,,,,,,,,,"Minist Land & Resources, Qingdao Inst Marine Geol, Key Lab Marine Hydrocarbon Resources & Environm G, Qingdao 266071, Peoples R ChinaChina Univ Geosci, Sch Earth Sci & Resources, Beijing 100083, Peoples R ChinaUniv Miami, Comparat Sedimentol Lab, Miami, FL 33149 USACNOOC Ltd, Zhanjiang Branch, Zhanjiang 524057, Peoples R ChinaChengdu Univ Technol, Coll Energy Resouces, Chengdu 610059, Peoples R China",,,,2015-05-13,WOS:000353112900007,,

This potential, derived from the stoichiometric relationship between oxygen consumption and the regeneration of organic matter, has recently been expanded by compilations of core top observations for two proxies: the delta C-13 gradient between coeval infaunal and epifaunal benthic foraminifera (Delta delta C-13), and biomarker preservation. Here, we review these newer proxies, and the more established redox proxy authigenic uranium (aU), to critically evaluate our understanding of the controls on proxy signal production and preservation. We locate our work in the equatorial Pacific, presenting both new data and a compilation of existing records from thirty-two sediment cores to draw semi-quantitative conclusions about bottom water oxygen and respired carbon concentrations over the last glacial period. We find that the biogeochemical limitations on these proxies may be more substantial than previously appreciated, and therefore suggest several best-practice recommendations for their application. Despite the recognized data limitations, the compilation identifies the glacial Pacific Ocean as a dominant sink for CO2 at all depths below the modern oxygen minimum zone. Our review emphasizes the importance of multiproxy reconstructions, informed by site-specific records of paleoproductivity, in drawing coherent, internally consistent conclusions about glacial ocean oxygenation and carbon storage.

Along urbanised coastlines, urban infrastructure is increasingly becoming the dominant habitat. These structures are often poor surrogates for natural habitats, and a diversity of eco-engineering approaches have been trialled to enhance their biodiversity, with varying success.2. We undertook a quantitative meta-analysis and qualitative review of 109 studies to compare the efficacy of common eco-engineering approaches (e.g. increasing texture, crevices, pits, holes, elevations and habitat-forming taxa) in enhancing the biodiversity of key functional groups of organisms, across a variety of habitat settings and spatial scales.3. All interventions, with one exception, increased the abundance or number of species of one or more of the functional groups considered. Nevertheless, the magnitude of effect varied markedly among groups and habitat settings. In the intertidal, interventions that provided moisture and shade had the greatest effect on the richness of sessile and mobile organisms, while water-retaining features had the greatest effect on the richness of fish. In contrast, in the subtidal, small-scale depressions which provide refuge to new recruits from predators and other environmental stressors such as waves, had higher abundances of sessile organisms while elevated structures had higher numbers and abundances of fish. The taxa that responded most positively to eco-engineering in the intertidal were those whose body size most closely matched the dimensions of the resulting intervention.4. Synthesis and applications. The efficacy of eco-engineering interventions varies among habitat settings and functional groups. This indicates the importance of developing site-specific approaches that match the target taxa and dominant stressors. Furthermore, because different types of intervention are effective at enhancing different groups of organisms, ideally a range of approaches should be applied-simultaneously to maximise niche diversity.",,,,,,,,,144,1,0,0,118,0,147,,,0021-8901,1365-2664,,,,,,,,,,"Sydney Inst Marine Sci, Mosman, NSW, AustraliaUniv Vigo, Fac Ciencias Mar, Dept Ecol & Biol Anim, Vigo, SpainUniv New South Wales, Sch Biol Earth & Environm Sci, Evolut & Ecol Res Ctr, Sydney, NSW, AustraliaMacquarie Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Sydney, NSW, AustraliaUniv Sydney, Sch Life & Environm Sci, Ctr Res Ecol Impacts Coastal Cities, Sydney, NSW, AustraliaUniv Washington, Dept Biol, Seattle, WA 98195 USAPlymouth Univ, Sch Biol & Marine Sci, Plymouth, Devon, EnglandUniv Coll Dublin, UCD Earth Inst, Sch Biol & Environm Sci, Dublin, Ireland",,,,2018-01-01,WOS:000417764600042,,

We are witnessing an increase in ocean heat, disturbance, acidification, bio-invasions and nutrients, and reducing oxygen levels. Several of these act like ratchets: once detrimental or negative changes have occurred, they may lock in place and may not be reversible, especially at gross ecological and ocean process scales. Each change may represent a loss to humanity of resources, ecosystem function, oxygen production and species. The longer we pursue unsuitable actions, the more we close the path to recovery and better ocean health and greater benefits for humanity in the future. We stand at a critical juncture and have identified eight priority issues that need to be addressed in unison to help avert a potential ecological disaster in the global ocean. They form a purposely ambitious agenda for global governance and are aimed at informing decision-makers at a high level. They should also be of interest to the general public. Of all the themes, the highest priority is to rigorously address global warming and limit surface temperature rise to 1.5 degrees C by 2100, as warming is the pre-eminent factor driving change in the ocean. The other themes are establishing a robust and comprehensive High Seas Treaty, enforcing existing standards for Marine Protected Areas and expanding their coverage, especially in terms of high levels of protection, adopting a precautionary pause on deep-sea mining, ending overfishing and destructive fishing practices, radically reducing marine pollution, putting in place a financing mechanism for ocean management and protection, and lastly, scaling up science/data gathering and facilitating data sharing. By implementing all eight measures in unison, as a coordinated strategy, we can build resilience to climate change, help sustain fisheries productivity, particularly for low-income countries dependent on fisheries, protect coasts (e.g. via soft-engineering/habitat-based approaches), promote mitigation (e.g. carbon storage) and enable improved adaptation to rapid global change.",,,,,,,,,41,1,0,0,25,0,44,,,1052-7613,1099-0755,,,,,,,,,,"IUCN, IUCN World Commiss Protected Areas, 28 Rue Mauverney, CH-1196 Gland, SwitzerlandUniv St Andrews, Marine Alliance Sci & Technol Scotland, Sch Biol, East Sands, St Andrews, Fife, ScotlandNat Hist Museum, Dept Life Sci, London, EnglandGlobelaw, Christchurch, New ZealandHaereticus Environm Lab, Clifford, VA USAUniv Plymouth, Sch Marine & Biol Sci, Plymouth, Devon, EnglandUniv Wollongong, Australian Natl Ctr Ocean Resources & Secur, Wollongong, NSW, AustraliaMarine Biol Assoc UK, Continuous Plankton Recorder Survey, Citadel Hill, Plymouth, Devon, EnglandUniv York, Dept Environm & Geog, York, N Yorkshire, EnglandUniv Oxford, Somerville Coll, Oxford, EnglandREV Ocean, Lysaker, NorwayInst Adv Sustainabil Studies, Potsdam, GermanyUniv Warwick, Sch Life Sci, Coventry, W Midlands, EnglandUniv British Columbia, Inst Oceans & Fisheries, Fisheries Econ Res Unit, Vancouver, BC, CanadaUniv British Columbia, Liu Inst Global Issues, Vancouver, BC, CanadaUniv Oxford, Dept Zool, Zool Res & Adm Bldg, Oxford, England",IUCNGlobelawHaereticus Environm LabREV OceanInst Adv Sustainabil Studies,,,2019-07-23,WOS:000477523400001,,

J,,,,,,,,,Russell Wynn,,"How do submarine landslides disintegrate and form long run-out turbidity currents in the deep ocean, and how erosive are these flows?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Awarded Grant,Jun 06 2013,2013,"Submarine landslides are a common geological feature in the deep ocean. They occur in a range of environments, from steep volcanic island flanks to areas of gently sloping sediment-covered open slope. Some submarine landslides disintegrate during their passage downslope and transform into sediment-gravity flows that can transport huge volumes of sediment for hundreds of kilometres over relatively flat ocean floor (<1o). Submarine landslides and sediment-gravity flows are the dominant process for global sediment transport from the continental shelf to the deep ocean, and are a major threat to an increasing worldwide network of seafloor infrastructure, e.g. oil/gas pipelines and telecommunications cables. Submarine landslides can also generate catastrophic tsunamis. For example, the giant Storegga Slide offshore Norway about 8200 years ago produced a tsunami that devastated coastal communities from Norway to Scotland. In addition, the deposits of sand-rich flows form many of the World's largest oil and gas reservoirs, while mud-rich flows may sequester globally significant volumes of organic carbon in the deep ocean. Improving our understanding of landslide and sediment-gravity flow hazards requires field data from past events; these data provide insights into important parameters such as volume and recurrence interval. These data also help us to model landslide-generated tsunamis and assess the associated risks.In this study we propose to generate the first ever field dataset tracing a large-scale submarine landslide and its associated sediment-gravity flow from source-to-sink. We will focus on the Moroccan Turbidite System offshore NW Africa, where the World's largest sediment-gravity flows were able to transport >100 km3 of sediment across distances up to 2000 km. The volume, source area and timing of several geologically recent (last 200,000 years) flows has been identified, using a dataset of >200 shallow sediment cores collected from across the entire depositional area over the last 30 years. Previous work has shown that most of these flows originated from (as yet unmapped) landslides in and around upper Agadir Canyon, which is one of the largest canyons in the World at 450 km long, up to 30 km wide and 1250 m deep. Most of upper Agadir Canyon above 4000 m water depth is unexplored, so we plan to map and sample landslides in this area using geophysical tools and sediment corers. The new results will allow us to undertake a novel 'mass balance' analysis, where we can quantify 1) the volume of material evacuated during the initial landslide, 2) the rate and extent of disintegration of failed material, 3) the volume of material removed by the resulting flow, and 4) the volume of eroded seafloor sediment incorporated in the flow. This unique quantitative field dataset will allow us to tackle three important science questions:1) How quickly do large submarine landslides disintegrate into long run-out sediment flows, and how is this process influenced by shape of the slope?2) How efficiently do landslides remove failed material, i.e. what proportion of landslide debris is deposited on the slope and how much transforms into a flow that is transported distally?3) How much sediment is incorporated into the flow through seafloor erosion, and where does most of this erosion take place?The results will be vital for ongoing landslide-tsunami and sediment gravity-flow modeling being undertaken by NOC and others in the NERC community, and will improve assessment of associated global geohazards.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,NE/J012955/1,,,,,,,,National Oceanography Centre,National Oceanography Centre,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:15384967,,
J,"Bernstein, Brock B.",,,,,,,,,,Decision Framework for Platform Decommissioning in California,,,,,,,,INTEGRATED ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT AND MANAGEMENT,,,,11,4,,,542,553,,,,10.1002/ieam.1695,,,,,,,Article,OCT 2015,2015,"This article describes the overall decision framework for eventual decisions about decommissioning the 27 operating oil and gas platforms offshore southern California. These platforms will eventually reach the end of their useful lifetimes (estimated between 2015 and 2030, although specific dates have not been determined). Current law and regulations allow for alternative uses in lieu of the complete removal required in existing leases. To prepare for eventual decommissioning, the California Natural Resources Agency initiated an in-depth process to identify and investigate issues surrounding possible decommissioning alternatives. The detailed evaluation of alternatives focused on 2-complete removal and artificial reefing that included partial removal to 85 feet below the waterline. These were selected after a comparison of the technical and economic feasibility of several potential alternatives, availability of a legal framework for implementation, degree of interest from proponents, and relative acceptance by state and federal decision makers. Despite California's history of offshore oil and gas production, only 7 decommissioning projects have been completed and these were all relatively small and close to shore. In contrast, nearly 30% of the California platforms are in water depths (as much as 1200 feet) that exceed any decommissioning project anywhere in the world. Most earlier projects considered an artificial reefing alternative but none were implemented and all platforms were completely removed. Future decisions about decommissioning must grapple with a more complex decision context involving greater technological and logistical challenges and cost, a wider range of viable options, tradeoffs among environmental impacts and benefits, and an intricate maze of laws, regulations, and authorities. The specific engineering differences between complete and partial removal provide an explicit basis for a thorough evaluation of their respective impacts.

The general composition of the assemblages suggests an anoxic depositional environment from a distal basin to a highly proximal shelf. The palynological assemblage identified in the Lower Dysodilic Shale Formation exhibits an abundance of dinoflagellate cysts and prasinophyte algae, with some taxa, such as Wetzeliella gochtii, Rhombodinium draco and Cordosphaeridium gracile, indicating a Rupelian early Chattian age for these deposits. In contrast, the Upper Dysodilic Shale Formation displays diverse assemblages of palynomorphs (more pollen and spores) and its age is older than middle Aquitanian. Geochemical (Total Organic Carbon content and Rock-Eval pyrolysis) and palynofacies (optical and scanning electron microscopy) analyses performed on samples from the Lower Dysodilic Shale Formation suggest that it contains type II kerogen (oil prone), consisting of abundant amorphous organic matter (ACM), extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) and coccoid bodies (bacteria or algae). This kerogen comes from a marine source (derived from phytoplankton and bacteria), and likely accumulated in a distal suboxic-anoxic basin. The Total Organic Carbon (TOC) content suggests good to excellent petroleum potential, especially for generating mixed oil and gas. The level of kerogen maturation (inferred from the Thermal Alteration Index, Tr a and prasinophyte algae fluorescence) lies at the boundary between immature and mature phases. The Upper Dysodilic Shale Formation is abundant in translucent and opaque phytoclasts, suggesting a continental organic matter source and type III kerogen, and thus would yield mainly gas. This organic matter was principally deposited in a highly proximal shelf setting. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Another option is the trapping of CO2 in deep-sea sediments at low temperature, either in liquid state or as gas hydrates. The Negative Buoyancy Zone (NBZ) and the Gas Hydrate Stability Zone (GHSZ) are used to calculate the theoretical storage volume. It depends essentially on the geothermal gradient and on the quality of the injected CO2. A sensitivity analysis shows that the storage volume in the Celtic Sea and the Bay of Biscay area is one order of magnitude lower if the injected fluid contains impurities like nitrogen or methane. Overall, the storage capacity in the French Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) exceeds 100 years of storage of the current French CO2 emissions from large point sources. The conservative estimate of the EEZ storage capacity is found to be higher than in the deep saline aquifers of the Paris Basin. Moreover, the CO2 storage capacity in this area is doubled when considering the zone beyond 200 miles from the shores. The implications of these results are potentially important for the long-term deployment strategy for CO2 storage in France and in Western Europe. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

They originate from the direct release of particles of plastic and as a consequence of the fragmentation of larger items. Microplastics are widespread in marine habitats from the poles to the equator; from the sea surface and shoreline to the deep sea. They are ingested by a range of organisms including commercially important fish and shellfish and in some populations the incidence of ingestion is extensive. Laboratory studies indicate that ingestion could cause harmful toxicological and/or physical effects. However, our understanding of the relative importance of these effects in natural populations is very limited. Looking to the future it seems inevitable that the quantity of microplastic will increase in the environment, since even if we could stop new items of debris entering the ocean, fragmentation of the items already present would continue for years to come. The term microplastics has only been in popular usage for a decade and while many questions remain about the extent to which they could have harmful effects, the solutions to reducing this contamination are at hand. There are considerable synergies to be achieved by designing plastic items for both their lifetime in service and their efficient end-of-life recyclability, since capturing waste via recycling will reduce usage of non-renewable oil and gas used in the production of new plastics and at the same time reduce the accumulation of waste in managed facilities such as land fill as well as in the natural environment.",,,,,,,,,303,8,0,0,236,1,324,,,,,978-3-319-16510-3; 978-3-319-16509-7,,,,,,,,,"Plymouth Univ, Sch Marine Sci & Engn, Marine Biol & Ecol Res Ctr, Plymouth PL4 8AA, Devon, England",,,,2015-01-01,WOS:000429300200009,,

We extracted sediment cores from 4 sites previously established on the island of Eleuthera, The Bahamas. We used a CN elemental analyzer to determine the carbon and nitrogen content of the sediment. We also used litterbags placed on or 10 cm below the soil surface to determine litter-decomposition rates of the sediments. Carbon content varied across sites (range = 13,945-54,853 g C/m(2)). The overall litter-decomposition rate was greater below ground than at the surface, although the difference was not statistically significant (P = 0.054).

The train cars were deployed in 1986 on substrate ranging from limestone colonized by macroalgae to a thin layer of sand over hard substrate.

Peak reproductive activity occurred at midday during the months of May and June at temperatures of 21.5-24.5 degrees C. Pair spawning between an initial phase female and a terminal phase male was observed on artificial and natural reef substrata, but interference spawning by small initial phase individuals was observed only on the natural substrate.

This review paper aims to provide state-of-the-art developments in CO2 storage. The review initially discussed the potential options for CO2 storage by highlighting the present status, current challenges and uncertainties associated with further deployment of established approaches (such as storage in saline aquifers and depleted oil and gas reservoirs) and feasibility demonstration of relatively newer storage concepts (such as hydrate storage and CO2-based enhanced geothermal systems). The second part of the review outlined the critical criteria that are necessary for storage site selection, including geological, geothermal, geohazards, hydrodynamic, basin maturity, and economic, societal and environmental factors. In the third section, the focus was on identification of CO2 behaviour within the reservoir during and after injection, namely injection-induced seismicity, potential leakage pathways, and long-term containment complexities associated with CO2-brine-rock interaction. In addition, a detailed review on storage capacity estimation methods based on different geological media and trapping mechanisms was provided. Finally, an overview of major CO2 storage projects, including their overall outcomes, were outlined. This review indicates that although CO2 storage is a technically proven strategy, the discussed challenges need to be addressed in order to accelerate the deployment of the technology.

The results show that the Severn Barrage has the potential to reduce the tidal currents in a highly dynamic estuary.

Yet the triggers to disease epidemics likely involve complex interactions among changing environmental conditions and associated biological communities. In the ocean, understanding disease outbreaks has been hindered by inadequate knowledge of how these various influences interact to determine susceptibility and resilience to disease. This project integrates research in community and disease ecology with microbial genomics, geospatial analysis, and state-of-the-art computational approaches toward an unprecedented understanding of the causes and consequences of wasting disease in eelgrass, an important vegetation type supporting coastal and estuarine ecosystems throughout the northern hemisphere. The research advances frontiers in understanding the growing but poorly appreciated threat of marine diseases, how disease ecology interacts with environmental change, and its consequences for the extensive ecosystems and coastal communities that depend on eelgrass, across 23 degrees of latitude along the Pacific coast of North America. The research will inform better management of threatened seagrass ecosystems, which provide important services including fisheries habitat, erosion control, carbon storage, and capture of nutrient runoff. The research will foster integrative approaches in the next generation, including high school students, undergraduates, graduate students, and postdocs working on the project, and each investigator's institution will work to recruit participants from under-represented groups. Best practices developed under this award, including the Eelisa disease app and drone mapping, will be disseminated for broader surveillance of seagrass disease and coastal habitat quality by both professional and citizen scientists in coordination with the Global Ocean Observing System's (GOOS) develpoment of seagrass extent as an Essential Ocean Variable. The triggers to marine disease epidemics are likely complex, and progress in understanding them has been hindered by a poor understanding of the multifaceted ecological context of the host-disease interaction. This project's overarching goal is to disentangle the web of direct and indirect interactions by which changing climate mediates prevalence of eelgrass wasting disease, and its consequences for threatened but important eelgrass ecosystems. The centerpiece is a comparative, cross-scale survey of eelgrass community composition, microbiome, and disease prevalence along thermal gradients of latitude and exposure to the ocean, providing the first coast-wide picture of disease dynamics in response to environmental change. In situ sampling will be linked to dynamics of eelgrass at landscape scales using unmanned aerial systems (drones) to quantify high-resolution changes in eelgrass extent and habitat quality. Experiments will test how the diverse biological community mediates impacts of the pathogen on eelgrass ecosystems.

California halibut (Paralichthys californicus) and white croaker (Genyonemus lineatus) are commonly caught from fishing piers in southern California; however, some individuals have been found to contain high concentrations of hazardous contaminants. Thus, human health hazard warnings are posted throughout the Los Angeles area to limit fish consumption. To document attraction, residency, and association to fishing piers, 42 California halibut and 198 white croaker were tagged with acoustic transmitters in regions of the Los Angeles and Long Beach Harbors, including a local fishing pier, and the movements of these fish were tracked throughout a 1.5 year period. Average (+/- SD) fish residency near piers was 90.5 +/- 104.8 days for California halibut and 31.9 +/- 25.7 days for white croaker. Only 18% of white croaker and 6% California halibut were detected migrating to the pier from other locations of the LA-LB Harbors, and most spent < 10 min within 300 m of the public fish pier. Only 14% of California halibut and 0.35% of white croaker geo-positions were within casting range (approximately 30 m) of the pier, thus California halibut show the greatest potential affinity for pier habitat. Due to their movement patterns and habitat associations California halibut are much more likely to be attracted to fishing piers than white croaker.",,,,,,,,,4,0,0,0,4,0,4,,,0038-3872,2162-4534,,,,,,,,,,"Calif State Univ Long Beach, Dept Biol Sci, Long Beach, CA 90840 USA",,,,2020-06-25,BCI:BCI202000542171,,

In 2000, approximately 36 million barrels (bbl) of oil were produced from Federal waters, all of which was transmitted to shore by pipeline. In comparison, approximately 260 million bbl of crude oil and distillates (e.g., gasoline) are transported by tanker along the California coast each year. The largest oil spill from offshore oil operations in California was the 1969 80,000-bbl Santa Barbara spill, which resulted in the loss of thousands of birds. This spill was a pivotal event for both the environmental movement in the U.S.A. and for offshore oil safety. After 1969, the rules and regulations governing offshore oil were rewritten and new rules were developed. Since 1969, only one spill from oil and gas operations offshore California has resulted in documented seabird mortality, the 163-bbl Platform Irene pipeline spill off Point Arguello in 1997, which resulted in the loss of more than 700 birds. Only a few small spills have occurred since 1969. However, based on the amount of offshore oil expected to be produced in California over the next 28 years and the number of spills that have occurred in the past, the risk of a spill of 1,000 bbl or greater occurring during that period is estimated at 41.2 percent for Federal operations and 8.4 percent for State operations (reflecting the much smaller volume of oil produced and transported in State waters).",,,,,,,,,11,0,0,0,9,0,13,,,1018-3337,,,,,,,,,,,"Ventura Fish and Wildlife Off, US Fish and Wildlife Serv, 2493 Portola Rd,Suite B, Ventura, CA, 93003, USA",,,,2003-01-01,BCI:BCI200500013722,,

This paper evaluates the effect of plausible shifts in watershed land use on hydrologic services on the Kona coast of Hawai'i Island by measuring vegetation effects on hydrologic fluxes, modeling land-use change impact on the water-supply aquifer, and evaluating the local water department's associated pumping expenses. Transitions between native and plantation forest will have a 25-40% greater impact on the aquifer than the transition from pasture to either forest type. However, for all transitions, the value to the water department is just 2-5% of the opportunity cost to landowners. To provide context for these findings, the effects of these land transitions on carbon storage, provision of native bird habitat, and land stewardship are assessed. Estimates show that delivery of other services does not always increase when water services increase and suggest that the value of impacts to these other services are greater than effects on water. In Kona, as in any watershed payment project, the particular physical and social context determines which services are valuable.

Initially calculations are performed with the front in an infinite domain region. By this means coastal effects are removed. The initial response is in terms of inertial oscillations in the surface layer. However, in the frontal area these are modified by interaction through the nonlinear momentum terms with regions of positive and negative vorticity associated with the alongfront flow. This leads to a change in amplitude, phase, and frequency of the inertial current, and a resulting Ekman pumping that drives near-inertial internal waves in the frontal region. On the positive vorticity side of the front these waves are at the superinertial frequency and rapidly propagate away. On the negative side they are at the subinertial frequency and are trapped and inertial energy leaks to depth. Calculations with a coastal boundary and no front show that the offshore propagation of near-inertial waves is similar to that found on the positive vorticity side of the front. This shows that in terms of superinertial internal wave generation and propagation the front acts in a similar manner to a coastal boundary. However, with a coastal boundary, inertial currents below the thermocline are phase shifted by 180 degrees from those above. This phase shift is only found in the frontal case when the front is adjacent to a coast and is due to the no-normal-flow condition at the coast. For the case of a stratified region between the coast and the front, near-inertial energy is trapped in this region and is dissipated at a rate depending upon the local value of vertical eddy viscosity. The offshore spatial distribution of near-inertial internal waves is found to be independent of whether the coastal region is represented by a vertical wall or a more realistic sloping seabed. However, in the case of a weak coastal front, the near-frontal distribution of near-inertial energy is influenced by the horizontal spatial variability of stratification within the front.",,,,,,,,,19,0,0,0,3,0,20,,,0022-3670,,,,,,,,,,,"Bidston Observ, Proudman Oceanog Lab, Birkenhead CH43 7RA, Merseyside, England",,,,2005-06-01,WOS:000230580500005,,

A critical phase within the marine operation activities is the positioning of the jack-up legs onto the seabed. During this process, large impact velocities and forces may arise from the barge's heave, roll and pitch motions, and structural damage of the legs can occur. This paper numerically investigates the effect of a flopper stopper (FS) on the motion responses of a jack-up barge from the offshore wind industry. The FS is known as a passive roll compensation device. It is suspended from the side of the barge by means of wire ropes and cantilever beams. A simple geometry of an FS is proposed, and the working principle introduced. For the loading condition before the leg-soil impact occurs, global dynamic analyses of the coupled system are conducted. Characteristic values of impact velocities are used to establish the jack-up operational limits in terms of the significant wave height and peak period. By comparing the operational limits for the barge with and without FS, it is found that FS should be placed on the weather side. At beam seas, the current FS can lead to a maximum increase in the operational wave height limit of 35%, whereas for the other wave headings, it may not be beneficial to use FS.",,,,,"36th ASME International Conference on Ocean, Offshore and Arctic Engineering36th ASME International Conference on Ocean, Offshore and Arctic Engineering","JUN 25-30, 2017JUN 25-30, 2017","ASME, Ocean Offshore & Arctic Engn DivASME, Ocean Offshore & Arctic Engn Div","Trondheim, NORWAYTrondheim, NORWAY",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,978-0-7918-5777-9,,,,,,,,,"Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol, Ctr Res Based Innovat Marine Operat SFI MOVE, Dept Marine Technol, NO-7491 Trondheim, NorwayNorwegian Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Marine Technol, NO-7491 Trondheim, NorwayNorwegian Univ Sci & Technol, Ctr Autonomous Marine Operat & Syst AMOS, Ctr Res Based Innovat Marine Operat SFI MOVE, Dept Marine Technol, NO-7491 Trondheim, NorwayUniv Stavanger, Dept Mech & Struct Engn & Mat Sci, NO-4036 Stavanger, Norway",,,,2018-01-03,WOS:000417227700050,,

We used Brownian bridge movement modeling to develop a population-wide, utilization probability surface for bald eagles (Haliaeetus leucocephalus) within the upper Chesapeake Bay. We used locations (n=320,304) for individuals (n=63) tracked with global positioning system (GPS) satellite transmitters between 2007 and 2011 in the analysis. We intersected the electrical network on the probability surface within Aberdeen Proving Ground, a 350-km(2) military installation to identify overlap between power lines and eagle activity centers. We also overlaid locations of eagle mortalities attributed to the lines (n=67) on the installation to assess the relationship between mortality rates and utilization probabilities. Areas of high bald eagle use were relatively rare on the landscape with only 0.1% and 5% of the area accounting for 10% and 30% of estimated utilization. Most electric lines were along roads and distributed away from eagle activity centers, with only 0.3% of lines located within areas with the highest estimated eagle use. Eagle mortalities were highly skewed to lines that overlapped with eagle activity centers. Eagle mortality rates (birds/100km/yr) were 42 times higher along lines associated with the highest 10% of eagle use compared to lines associated with the lowest 10% use, suggesting that estimated utilization may be an effective proxy for mortality risk associated with electric line hazards. The majority (71.9%) of high-use bald eagle areas delineated within the study area have no existing electric lines. Utilization probabilities may be a potential tool for site-specific infrastructure planning.

An attractive option is to develop innovative energy systems including renewable and conventional sources. The paper investigates the possibility to integrate a wind farm into an offshore combined cycle power plant. The design of such an energy system is a complex task as many, possibly conflicting, requirements have to be satisfied. The large variability of operating conditions due to the intermittent nature of wind and to the different stages of exploitation of an oil field makes it challenging to identify the optimal parameters of the combined cycle and the optimal size of the wind farm. To deal with the issue, an optimisation procedure was developed that was able to consider the performance of the system at a number of relevant off-design conditions in the definition of the optimal design. A surrogate modelling technique was applied in order to reduce the computational effort that would otherwise make the optimisation process unfeasible. The developed method was applied to a case study and the resulting optimal designs were assessed and compared to other concepts, with or without wind power integration. The proposed offshore power plant returned the best environmental performance, as it was able to significantly cut the total carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions in comparison to all the other concepts evaluated. The economic analysis showed the difficulty to repay the additional investment for a wind farm and the necessity of favourable conditions, in terms of gas and carbon dioxide (CO2) prices.",,,,,,,,,16,0,0,0,0,0,16,,,,2227-9717,,,,,,,,,,"Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol NTNU, Dept Energy & Proc Engn, NO-7491 Trondheim, Norway",,,,2019-01-14,WOS:000454735600018,,

Evidence now shows geographically extensive changes of zooplankton biomass in concert with variations in the atmospheric and oceanic circulation in the NE Pacific. However, such analyses of bulk zooplankton biomass do not distinguish among taxa with diverse life histories, some of which are important trophic links to planktivorous fishes and others of which are not. The species composition of the zooplankton can strongly influence the intensity of zooplankton fish linkages, and consequently alter recruitment success. Mechanistic understanding and quantitative modeling of climate linkages to planktivorous fishes will depend upon specific knowledge of the zooplankton fauna and the differential responses of different zooplankton taxa to variations in circulation and productivity of the NE Pacific. We propose a retrospective analysis of the past 43/a decades of the California Current System (CCS). We will use the high quality CalCOFI zooplankton collection, together with associated hydrographic data and indices of atmospheric forcing, to understand the causes of changes in the zooplankton from 1951 to the present. Three aspects of the zooplankton composition will be investigated: changes in the high level taxonomic composition of all holozooplankton taxa, including gelatinous and crustacean forms; changes in the species composition of copepods and selected other taxa; and changes in trophic structure and nitrogen economy as inferred from the N stable isotope composition of two species of particlegrazing copepods. We hypothesize that there have been differential, taxon specific responses to: ª Decadal scale changes in the climate of the NE Pacific, including the 1976 77 warming event. . El Nifio and other interannual variations in flow from the equatorial region and from the Subarctic Pacific. Regional differences in the intensity of coastal upwelling and cross shore transport. Our studies will provide, for the first time, an understanding of multi decadal zooplankton species changes in the Pacific. We will uncover the taxa responsible for the longterm 70% decline in CCS zooplankton biomass. We will establish the temporal coherence of population changes in the central and southern sectors of the CCS, with which to analyze the covariation with related zooplankton species in the Subarctic Pacific.

We used stable isotope probing (SIP) to identify aerobic bacteria oxidizing gaseous hydrocarbons in surface sediment from the Coal Oil Point seep field located offshore of Santa Barbara, California. After incubating sediment with C-13-labeled methane, ethane, or propane, we confirmed the incorporation of C-13 into fatty acids and DNA. Terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP) analysis and sequencing of the 16S rRNA and particulate methane monooxygenase (pmoA) genes in C-13-DNA revealed groups of microbes not previously thought to contribute to methane, ethane, or propane oxidation. First, C-13 methane was primarily assimilated by Gammaproteobacteria species from the family Methylococcaceae, Gammaproteobacteria related to Methylophaga, and Betaproteobacteria from the family Methylophilaceae. Species of the latter two genera have not been previously shown to oxidize methane and may have been cross-feeding on methanol, but species of both genera were heavily labeled after just 3 days. pmoA sequences were affiliated with species of Methylococcaceae, but most were not closely related to cultured methanotrophs. Second, C-13 ethane was consumed by members of a novel group of Methylococcaceae. Growth with ethane as the major carbon source has not previously been observed in members of the Methylococcaceae; a highly divergent pmoA-like gene detected in the C-13-labeled DNA may encode an ethane monooxygenase. Third, C-13 propane was consumed by members of a group of unclassified Gammaproteobacteria species not previously linked to propane oxidation. This study identifies several bacterial lineages as participants in the oxidation of gaseous hydrocarbons in marine seeps and supports the idea of an alternate function for some pmoA-like genes.",,,,,,,,,99,10,0,0,80,1,123,,,0099-2240,1098-5336,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Dept Earth Sci, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USAUniv Calif Santa Barbara, Grad Program Marine Sci, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USAUniv Calif Santa Barbara, Inst Marine Sci, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USACALTECH, Div Geol & Planetary Sci, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA",,,,2010-10-01,WOS:000282136700010,20675448,

ARS is a kind of stockade made up of cylindrical vertical structures (d. = 0.33 cm, li = 20 cm) that are placed on a horizontal plate (S. = a(1) center dot a(2) = 900 cm(2)). The stockade covers space (Vg = 0.018 m(3)) partly occupied by vertical structures (Sigma V-i = V-i center dot n, where n is the total number of axial structures on the module horizontal surface), while the rest of it remains free (V-f = V-Gamma - Sigma V-i). Three possible densities were considered for the arrangement of the said vertical structures (n/S-o), and namely: 544, 3956 and 10 678 pieces per m(2), while the concentration of their surface area within the ARS (C-s = (Sigma S-i) / V-g) was set as 0.056, 0.295 and 1.106 per cm. For 43 days (from May 27 to July 9 2014), the ARSs were kept in the offshore strip of the Sevastopol Bay (Black Sea) at the depth of 2 m. The water temperature in the sea ranged from 23.3 to 25.6 degrees C. Samples were taken every 6-8 days. In the composition of the biofouling, diatom algae were found to be predominating in the mass, while also present were sprouts of multicellular algae and, of animals, hydroids, bryozoans, spirogbis, and larvae of balanuses were also observed. On the 7th day of exposure, 51 species of diatom algae were found on the surface of the ARS with a loose (544 pieces per cm(2)) and dense (10 678 pieces per cm(2)) structures arrangement, with only 15 species making a significant (> 5 %) contribution to the total number (n(i), %) and biomass (W-i, %) of the community in certain sections of vertical structures (Achnanthes longipes, Amphora hyalina, Berkeleya rutilans, Cylindrotheca closterium, Entomoneis paludosa, Haslea ostrearia, Licmophora abbreviata, L. hastata, Neosynedra provincialis, Nitzschia sigma, N. tenuirostris, Parlibellus delognei, Pleurosigma elongatum, Proboscidea insecta, Trachyneis aspera). The values of the Sorensen - Chekanovskii (K-sc = 0.7) and Stugren - Radulescu (P-sr = -0.077) coefficients indicate a very close similarity between the systematic composition of the communities being compared. As the fouling density value changes in vertical structures (W/S-i) during the period under consideration, four characteristic stages can be distinguished. The first, by convention, is completed on the 7th day of observation, and an approximately equal fouling density (0.51-0.91 mg (dry weight) per cm(2)) is found to have been created by this time on the tops of the structures, regardless of the density of their structures, and it differs significantly (0.03-0.57 mg (dry weight) per cm(2)) in the middle part of the ARS. The second stage (7th-21st days) is characterized by low rates of biomass increase per unit of the surface colonized (0.003-0.08, 0.25, -0.17 mg (dry weight) center dot day-(1) center dot cm-(2)) and by relatively low values W/S-i (0.36-2.23 mg (dry weight) per cm(2)). The third stage is characterized by a rapid increase in the fouling density (0.30-0.75 mg (dry weight) center dot day-(1) center dot cm-(2)). The maximum W/S-i (3.09-9.07 mg (dry weight) per cm(2)) is reached on the 29th and 36th days of exposure. The fourth, final stage is characterized by a decrease in W/S., this being the period of partial disintegration of the previously formed fouling community. The paper analyzes in detail the vertical distribution of the dry biofouling biomass (W/S-i) along the axial structures with different density of their arrangement on the 7th, 14th, 21st, 29th, 36th and 43th days of the experiment. The general picture of the vertical distribution of W/S. on the 29th and 43th days was found to be similar. With the increase in the density of vertical structures arrangement, the maximum fouling biomass shifts towards the upper boundary of the ARS. In loosely arranged structures, the maximum biomass is located in the middle part of the canopy, while in not so densely arranged structures (3956 pieces per cm(2)), the bulk of the biomass (83.5-73.8 %) is concentrated in the upper half of the canopy, while in densely arranged structures, in the upper 2-cm layer (63.9-79.3 %). The paper also considers the relationship between the biofouling dry mass concentration throughout the inhabited space (C-w = (Sigma W-i) / V-f) and the concentration of the ARS physical surface with respect to the upper ARS (1) layer and the entire volume of the reef structure (2) in 20-cm high structures on the 29th day of the experiment ((1): C-w = -0.232 + 7.136Cs, R-2 = 0.99; (2): C-w = 0.084 + 2.652Cs, R-2 = 0.93). It shows that in 20-cm vertical structures an increase in the value of Cs is accompanied by the increased screening effect produced by both structure elements and biofouling - a process which leads to the growth of biofouling agents being partially checked by the insufficient inflow of light and biogenic elements and, accordingly, to a shortage of biomass in the given volume of the structure space.",,,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,,,2499-9768,2499-9776,,,,,,,,,,"RAS, Kovalevsky Inst Marine Biol Res, Sevastopol, Russia",,,,2017-01-01,BCI:BCI202000761018,,

We investigated the response of recruits of the temperate coral Oculina arbuscula to increased CO2 concentrations, a species whose adults show significant tolerance to elevated concentrations of CO2. Specifically, we exposed small colonies (5-12 mm diameter) to 475, 710, and 1261 ppm CO2 for 75 d in the laboratory to address the hypothesis that, like adults, the health of O. arbuscula recruits is not affected by increased CO2 concentrations. Calcification rates were monitored regularly during the experiment, while mortality, respiration rates, photosynthetic rates, algal symbiont densities, and soluble protein were quantified at the end. As predicted, CO2 concentration did not impact survival, algal densities, or soluble protein concentrations in O. arbuscula recruits. In contrast, both calcification rates and photosynthesis:respiration ratios tended to be lower at higher CO2. Comparing the results of this study on recruits with published studies on adults suggested that both life stages exhibit a similar non-linear response to CO2 concentration, whereby recruits may be unable to counter the increased energetic cost of calcification that occurs at the highest CO2. Based on these results and environmental monitoring showing that mean pCO(2) is increasing by similar to 2.4 % yr(-1) in the waters off Georgia, USA, we conclude that O. arbuscula recruits may begin to exhibit depressed calcification rates within the current century if CO2 emissions are not reduced.",,,,,,,,,4,0,0,0,4,0,4,,,0171-8630,1616-1599,,,,,,,,,,"Georgia Southern Univ, James H Oliver Jr Inst Coastal Plain Sci, Statesboro, GA 30460 USAUniv Georgia, Dept Marine Sci, Athens, GA 30602 USAFlorida Atlantic Univ, Harbor Branch Oceanog Inst, Ft Pierce, FL 34946 USA",,,,2020-04-08,WOS:000521739200005,,

This project will deploy accurate and precise in-situ sensors that will begin the development of pH and pCO2 time series off the central Oregon coast - a region that is amongst the mostly strongly impacted by corrosive upwelled waters within the California Current system. These sensors, in conjunction with lower-frequency ship-based calibration as well as horizontal and vertical samples, will provide a detailed and integrated look at the scope and impacts of accelerated biogeochemical changes in a coastal inner-shelf ecosystem that is currently unmonitored for carbonate chemistry shifts. Intellectual Merit: Coastal waters in upwelling regions will experience some of the earliest and most severe onsets of ocean acidification. Already, limited field surveys suggest that the portions of the California Current system (CCS) are experiencing low pH conditions during the summer upwelling season. Determination of the direct and indirect impact of ocean acidification on marine calcifiers and other pH or pCO2 sensitive organisms depends critically on accurate assessments of both current OA stress regimes and the likely scope of future biogeochemical change. To date, we have virtually no such time series in the inner-shelf waters of upwelling shelves where the combined burdens of CO2 increase from anthropogenic and respiratory sources are maximal. This observational gap is a severe impediment to progress in the study of this major consequence of global climate change and its ecological consequences. This is due largely to the lack of accurate and reliable sensors that can be deployed in the field in inner shelf waters. Recently, sensors for pH and pCO2 have been developed that are capable of providing the required accuracy, precision and reliability needed in instruments deployed in the challenging and dynamic environments of the inner shelf. For systems where biogeochemical signals are spatially heterogeneous, an important criterion for developing time series data is the ability to resolve spatial variations that are ecologically important and/or crucial for controlling for potential aliasing effects. OSU-PISCO (Oregon State University, Partnership for Interdisciplinary Studies of Coastal Oceans) has acquired funds for one sensor array, and in July 2009, will deploy the array on a mooring to begin the first pH and pCO2 time series in the inner shelf waters of the northern CCS. This EAGER project will allow deployment of a second sensor array. The project has three goals: documenting spatial differences between pH and pCO2 between the two coastal sites, providing a contrasting monitored site for organismal and ecological impacts studies, and providing a regional back-up site in case of loss or failure of the first instruments. The expanded regional sensor array in Oregon will be linked to arrays at Bodega Marine Lab and in southern California to form the first stage of what we expect will be a west coast network of ocean acidification sensors. These will provide the first datasets available for establishing the contextual environmental information necessary for research on the ecological consequences of ocean acidification. Broader Impacts: Ocean acidification is a timely and important concern and there is a need for immediate and concerted focus by scientists, economists, policy-makers, managers and the public. To interpret and evaluate lab and field studies of OA impacts on the marine biota accurate data on pH levels and variability in the natural environment are essential. This project will have a major impact on building research capacity in this area by adding another observation site at a critical location where there is intense upwelling. This site will add to a network of other monitoring and research sites in the California Current system.

Recent changes in the institutional and political context in Brazil have enabled the new government to ignore both the established consultation process and the ongoing SEA-type process. This shift of orientation led to the inclusion of environmentally sensitive areas in bidding rounds in 2019.

An integrated underwater surveying apparatus was employed in this research, which included a dual-frequency side-scan sonar, a magnetometer and a single-beam echo sounder. The procedure of this investigation was divided into two interdependent phases, i.e., search for/detection phase and identification phase. In the first phase, the existence of a potential target on the seafloor was concluded within an intended searching area of 1 nm(2). The ship-shaped target rests upright was located in 40 m of water with seabed gradient of 1 :40. The second phase was initiated by the acquisition of high-resolution sonographs, with feature resolution in the scale of decimeter, at various aspects to the potential target. A mutual comparison of the detailed wreck acoustic images against photographs and drawings of the deployed battleship proved the identity of the potential target.Based on the results of this identification procedure, among which 10 sections and 24 individual items were evaluated and compared, the potential target was demonstrated to be the decommissioned tank landing ship, i.e., Zhong Rong battleship. The battleship was modified under a predetermined design and was then scuttled to become an artificial reef for the purpose of improvement of the local marine resources. This investigation, which was the first stage of a long-term research project, concluded that in addition to conducting search for and detection of underwater proud targets, side-scan sonar could be used as a potential and efficient instrument for the identification of sunken ships or wreckages without the necessitating of the application of an extra optical instrument, such as an ROV.

It was compiled by a National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Biological Review Team (BRT) in response to a petition filed by the Center for Biological Diversity to list the ribbon seal as threatened or endangered under the U.S. Endangered Species Act (16 U.S.C. 1531 et seq.) (ESA), primarily due to concern about threats to this species' habitat from climate warming and loss of sea ice. There are two key tasks associated with conducting an ESA status review: The first is to delineate thetaxonomic group under consideration; the second is to conduct an extinction risk assessment to determine whether the petitioned species is threatened or endangered. The ESA defines the term endangered species as any species which is in danger of extinction throughout all or a significant portion of its range. The term threatened species is defined as any species which is likely to become an endangered species within the foreseeable future throughout all or a significant portion of its range. The horizon of the foreseeable future was determined to be the year 2050 because past and current emissions of greenhouse gases have already largely set the course for changes in the atmosphere and climate until that time, and because of enormous uncertainty about future social and political decisions on emissions that will dominate projection of conditions further into the future. Species Background: The ribbon seal is a strikingly-marked member of the family Phocidae that primarily inhabits the Sea of Okhotsk, and Bering and Chukchi Seas. This species is strongly associated with the sea ice during its whelping, mating, and pelage molt periods, from mid-March through June. Most of the rest of the year is spent at sea; the species is rarely observed on land. The rates of survival and reproduction are not well known, but ribbon seals can live 20 to 30 years. They become sexually mature at 1-5 years of age, probably depending on environmental conditions, and adult females usually give birth every year to a single pup which is nursed for 3-4 weeks and then abandoned to fend for itself. Species Delineation: Although there are two main breeding areas for ribbon seals, one in the Sea of Okhotsk and one in the Bering Sea, there is currently no evidence of discrete subpopulations on which to base a separation into distinct population segments. The population composing the entire species is the subject of this review. A molecular genetic analysis to identify geographic population structure is a high priority for research. Extinction Risk Assessment: To assess the extinction risk, the BRT evaluated the risks based on specificdemographic factors of the species, such as abundance, productivity, spatial structure, and diversity, as well as specific threats faced by the species, as outlined in Section 4(a)(1) of the ESA: [center dot] the present or threatened destruction, modification, or curtailment of its habitat or range, [center dot] over-utilization for commercial, recreational, scientific, or educational purposes, [center dot] disease or predation,. the inadequacy of existing regulatory mechanisms, or [center dot] other natural or manmade factors affecting its continued existence Demographic factors: With a population likely comprising at least 200,000 individuals, ribbon seals are not currently at risk from the demographic issues of low abundance commonly associated with ESAlisting decisions, such as demographic stochasticity, inbreeding, loss of genetic diversity, and depensatory effects. The current population trend is unknown, but a recent estimate of 49,000 ribbon seals in the eastern and central Bering Sea is consistent enough with historical estimates to suggest that no major or catastrophic change has occurred in recent decades. The species is thought to occupy its entire historically-observed range; there are no portions of the range in which ribbon seals have been reported to have disappeared or become extinct. A comprehensive survey of ribbon seal abundance, a new analysis of demographic data obtained from the former Soviet commercial harvest, and genetic studies of population structure are high priorities for research and monitoring. Present or threatened destruction, modification, or curtailment of the species habitat or range: The main concerns about the conservation status of the ribbon seal stem from the likelihood that its sea ice habitat has been modified by the warming climate and, more so, that the scientific consensus projections are for continued and perhaps accelerated warming in the foreseeable future. A reliable assessment of the future conservation status of ribbon seals requires a focus on projections of the specific regional conditions, especially sea ice, and changes that could impact vital rates. In contrast to the Arctic Ocean, where sea ice is present year-round, the ice in the Bering Sea and Sea of Okhotsk is seasonal in nature. Despite the recent dramatic reductions in Arctic Ocean ice extent during summer, the sea ice in the northern Bering Sea and Sea of Okhotsk is expected to continue forming annually in winter for the foreseeable future. The sea ice regimes in these seas will continue to be subject to large interannual variations in extent and seasonal duration, as they have throughout recorded history. While there may be more frequent years in which ice coverage is reduced, the late March to early May period in which ribbon seal reproduction occurs will continue to have substantial ice, particularly in the northern regions of the breeding range. In years of low ice it is likely that ribbon seals will adjust at least in part by shifting their breeding locations in response to the position of the ice edge as they have likely done in the past in response to interannual variability. There could be impacts on ribbon seal survival and recruitment from more frequent years of reduced ice thickness and duration of seasonal ice coverage. Decreased availability of stable platforms for adults to complete their molt out of the water may lower survival, but it is not currently possible to quantify this impact or the extent to which ribbon seals may adapt by shifting locations for key life history events of breeding and molting. Weaned pups are likely dependent on sea ice for a 2-3 week period as they develop self-sufficiency in foraging. They enter the water regularly during this period, and therefore may not be particularly sensitive to modest reductions in coverage or quality, though they may be relatively limited in their capability to respond to rapidly deteriorating ice fields by relocating over large distances, a factor that could occur more frequently in the foreseeable future. Ocean acidification, a result of increased carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, may impact ribbon seal survival and recruitment through disruption of trophic regimes that are dependent on calcifying organisms. The nature and timing of such impacts are extremely uncertain. Because of ribbon seals apparent dietary flexibility and because the major effects of ocean acidification may not appear until the latter half of this century, this threat should be of less immediate concern than the direct effects of sea ice degradation. Changes in ribbon seal prey, anticipated in response to ocean warming and loss of sea ice, have the potential for negative impacts, but the possibilities are complex. Some changes already documented in the Bering Sea and the North Atlantic Ocean are of a nature that could be ameliorative or beneficial to ribbon seals. For example, several fish species, including walleye pollock (Theragra chalcogramma), a common ribbon seal prey, have shown northward distribution shifts and increased recruitment in response to warming, at least initially. These ecosystem responses may have very long lags as they propagate through trophic webs. Apparent flexibility in ribbon seal foraging locations and habits may make these threats of lower concern than more direct impacts from changes in sea ice. The threats associated with impacts of global warming on ribbon seal habitat, to the extent that they may pose risks to ribbon seals, were presumed to manifest throughout the current breeding and molting range (for sea-ice related threats) or throughout the entire range (for ocean warming and acidification) of the species, in as much as the finer-scale spatial distribution of these threats is not currently well understood. The question, therefore, of whether any of these poses a risk to the continued existence of ribbon seals in merely a significant portion of, rather than the entire, range was subsumed by this approach to the qualitative risk assessment. Over-utilization for commercial, subsistence, recreational, scientific, or educational purposes: Recreational, scientific, and educational utilization of ribbon seals is currently at very low levels and is not projected to increase to significant threat levels in the foreseeable future. Commercial harvests by Russian sealers have at times been high enough to cause significant reductions in abundance and catchper-unit-effort. The population apparently rebounded from a period of high harvest in the 1960s. Substantial but lower numbers were harvested for a few years in the early 1990s. Although Russian government quotas were recently in place that would allow large harvests (~18,000 annually), the actual takes are low because of poor economic viability. There is some effort in Russia to develop new uses and markets for seal products, but unless these are successful, the harvest is unlikely to increase in the near future. Subsistence harvest levels have been low historically, but could potentially increase in the future if ribbon seals are forced to use a reduced and more northerly ice field, which could put them in closer proximity to Alaska Native communities near the Bering Strait. Diseases, parasites, and predation: A variety of pathogens (or antibodies), diseases, helminthes, cestodes, and nematodes, have been found in ribbon seals. The prevalence of these agents is not unusual among seals, but the population impact is unknown. There may be an increased risk of outbreaks of novel pathogens or parasites as climate-related shifts in species distributions lead to new modes of transmission. There is little or no direct evidence of significant predation on ribbon seals and they are not thought to be a primary prey of any predators. Polar bears and killer whales may be the most likely opportunistic predators in the current sea ice regime, but walruses could pose a potentially greater risk if reduced sea ice conditions force these pagophilic species into closer proximity in the future. Inadequacy of existing regulatory mechanisms: There is little evidence that the inadequacy of existing regulatory mechanisms currently poses a threat to ribbon seals. However, there are no known regulatory mechanisms that effectively address reductions in sea ice habitat at this time. Also, it is unclear what regulatory mechanisms are in place to ensure that potential commercial harvests in Russia are conducted in a sustainable fashion. Other natural or human factors affecting the species' continued existence: Although some pollutants are elevated in ribbon seals, there is no conspicuous evidence of toxicity or other significant impacts to the species. Continued and expanded monitoring would be prudent, to document any trends in the contaminants of greatest concern. Oil and gas exploration and development activities may include artificial- island construction, drilling operations, pipeline construction, seismic surveys, and vessel and aircraft operations. The main issues for evaluating the impacts of exploration and development activities on ribbon seals are the effects of noise, disturbance, and potential oil spills produced from these activities. Any negative effects on ribbon seals from noise and disturbance associated with development activities are likely to be minor and localized. Ribbon seals are also highly dispersed during the summer, open-water season so the rate ofinteractions with seismic surveys would likely be low, and in any case seals have not been shown to be significantly impacted by oil and gas seismic surveys. The threat posed to ribbon seals by oil spills will increase if offshore oil and gas development and shipping activities increase across their range as predicted. The potential impacts would be greatest during April-June when the seals are relatively aggregated, and substantially lower during the remainder of the year when they are dispersed in the open water throughout the North Pacific Ocean, Sea of Okhotsk, and Bering and Chukchi Seas. Estimates from observed by-catch in commercial fisheries imply that less than 200 ribbon seals per year are taken, though mortalities are certainly under-reported in some fisheries. Because there is little or no fishery activity near aggregations of ribbon seals when they are associated with ice, and they are highly dispersed in the remainder of the year, by-catch is unlikely to be a significant threat to ribbon seal populations. For the same reason, competition from fisheries that reduce local abundance of ribbon seal prey is unlikely to be significant. Broad-scale reduction in a commercially-fished, primary prey species could have a significant impact, but the large groundfish fisheries in Alaska waters, at least, are well managed to prevent depletion of the stocks. The extraordinary reduction in Arctic sea ice that has occurred in recent years has renewed interest in trans-Arctic navigation routes connecting the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans via the Northwest Passage and the Northern Sea Route. The Chukchi Sea and Bering Strait would be the most likely areas for increased exposure of pelagic ribbon seals to ship traffic, because of the geographic constriction and the seasonal migration of part of the ribbon seal population around the beginning and end of the ice-free season. However, there is currently little or no information on direct impacts from shipping on seals in open water. Ribbon seals hauled out on sea ice may also be at risk from increased ship traffic, but likely only during spring and early summer, and then only by ice-reinforced ships. Assessing risk from increases in shipping and transportation is difficult because projections about future ship trends within the ribbon seal's range are currently unavailable.Several of the threats considered in this section on Other natural or human factors affecting the species' continued existence were associated with specific regions or times of year when ribbon seal distribution is restricted, such as increased ship traffic in the Bering Strait region or oil and gas activities during the ribbon seal breeding and molting seasons. If such threats were to occur and cause a high rate of mortality or forgone reproduction, the species could be considered threatened or endangered in a significant portion of its range. However, none of the threats considered here is presently considered to be both sufficiently likely to occur and sufficiently high in impact, alone or cumulatively, to raise concernabout them posing a risk of ribbon seal extinction or becoming endangered throughout a significant portion of its range. Status of the ribbon seal population: Qualitative assessments of the balance between identified threats and a species' capability to adjust must often be decided on the basis of expert opinion and on policy, especially policy regarding consideration given to uncertainty. Such policy is outside the scope of this status review. To assist in the process, however, the BRT addressed its summary conclusions on ribbon seal status using a scoring system in which each of the eight members assigned up to 10 likelihood points in support of the conclusion. In consideration of all of the threats and potential threats identified above, the assessment of the risks posed by those threats, the possible cumulative impacts, and the uncertainty associated with all of these, the BRT drew the following conclusions: 1. Ribbon seals are not in current danger of extinction throughout all or a significant portion of their range. (78 out of 80 likelihood points) 2. The ribbon seal population is likely to decline gradually for the foreseeable future, primarily from slight but chronic impacts on reproduction and survival caused by reduced frequency of years with sea ice of suitable extent, quality, and duration of persistence. (51 out of 80 likelihood points) 3. Despite the expectation of a gradual decline, ribbon seals are not likely to become an endangered species within the foreseeable future throughout all or a significant portion of their range. (57 out of 80 likelihood points) Finally, to reinforce the notion that reliable and effective assessments of species of conservation status cannot be conducted without adequate estimates of abundance, the BRT concluded that despite the expectation of a declining ribbon seal population, it will likely not be possible to detect and document a significant overall decline unless monitoring is made a very high priority for both the Bering Sea and Sea of Okhotsk.",,,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Alaska Fisheries Science Center, 7600 Sand Point Way NE, Seattle, WA 98115, USA",,,,2008-12-01,ZOOREC:ZOOR14510065385,,

Particular importance is attributed to sulfide reducing bacteria (SRB) which occur in waters, bottom sediments, creating biofilms on metal surface, and may start a process known as microbial induced corrosion (MIC). The occurrence of these bacteria and their populations indicates potential and intensification of corrosion processes. The aim of the study was to determine the number of microorganisms from various groups in the Baltic Sea sediments, especially those that are active in biological corrosion processes. This data can be used for a study comprehensive of corrosive processes in the marine environment, and as a result, to carry out a real assessment of the risks arising from the release of toxic substances into the environment from conventional and chemical weapons lying on the bottom caused by progressing corrosive processes, including biological corrosion.The article presents the results of research on the presence and accounts of microorganisms in bottom sediment samples taken from the dump sites of chemical and conventional ammunition in the Baltic Sea. Particular attention was paid to halophilic and halotolerant bacteria due to their significant contribution to both corrosion and decomposition processes of CWA and explosives, particularly in the saltwater environment.There were high and quite similar numbers of mesophilic, psychrophilic and halophilic bacteria in the studied samples, while significantly smaller numbers of anaerobic bacteria. The amount of mesophilic bacteria ranges from 6.42*10(3) to 2.85*10(7), on average 4.5*10(6) in 1 g DM, psychrophilic from 5.73*10(3) in 1g DM to 4.11*10(7) in 1 g DM, on average 6.44*10(6) in 1 g DM, whereas for halophylic from 4.09*10(2) to 5.60*10(7), on average 5.83*10(6) in 1 g DM. The numbers of fungi were at a much lower level and ranged from 4.65*10(1) to 8.08*10(2), on average 2.63*10(2) in 1 g DM. mesophilic fungi and from 0 to 1.60*10(3), on average 3.58*10(2) in 1 g DM for psychrophilic fungi. The presence of sulfide reducing bacteria (SRB) was also detected in large populations, especially when they were isolated by means of the medium prepared with seawater (from 9.72 to 5.36*10(2), on average 2.52*10(2) in 1 g DM), which indicates their adaptation to the saline environment and promotes of biological anaerobic processes, including corrosive processes. No significant amounts of iron bacteria were found, probably due to the small amount of oxygen in the sampling area. The small number of iron bacteria indicates that primarily anaerobic sulfide reducing bacteria (SRB) have the major part in the microbial corrosion phenomena. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

During the dredging operation in Varnavas, the induced dredge plume traveled up to 750 m from the shoreline, featured by light attenuation coefficient (c(p)) maxima of 4.01-4.61 m(-1) and suspended particulate matter (SPM) concentrations up to 6.01 mg L-1. After dredging the previous parameters reduced to the ambient seawater condition, 0.45 m(-1) and < 2.8 mg L-1 on average, respectively. Likewise in Aliveri, the dredging-associated sediment plume drifted offshore up to 400 m from the shoreline, characterized by c(p) maxima of 2.11-4.86 m(-1) and SPM concentrations up to 13.07 mg L-1. After the completion of the excavation and trenching activities, the c(p) and SPM values were restored to the pre-disturbance condition, 0.6 m(-1) and < 2.2 mg L-1 on average, respectively. The migration of the dredge plume in both dredging sites was accomplished through the formation of intermediate and benthic nepheloid layers, whose development and evolution were governed by seawater stratification and flow regime. The dredging-derived SPM levels appeared to increase within a distance of no more than 300 m from the shoreline (near-field zone). Based on data from the literature, this SPM enhancement together with the deposition of a post-dredging residual mud veneer in the near-field zone could deteriorate local marine biota, but in a reversible way.",,,,,,,,,3,0,0,0,1,0,3,,,0167-6369,1573-2959,,,,,,,,,,"Hellen Ctr Marine Res, Inst Oceanog, 46-7 Km Athens Sounio Ave, Anavyssos 19013, Attica, GreeceUniv Athens, Fac Geol & Geoenvironm, Sch Sci, Dept Hist Geol & Paleontol, Univ Campus, Zografos 15784, GreeceHarokopio Univ, Geog Dept, Eleftheriou Venizelou 70, Athens 17671, GreeceNatl Tech Univ Athens, Sch Rural & Surveying Engn, Remote Sensing Lab, Iroon Polytechneiou 9, Zografos 15780, Greece",,,,2019-12-24,WOS:000501808600003,31811395,

Peatlands and vegetated coastal wetlands are among the most carbon rich sinks on the planet sequestering approximately as much carbon as do global forest ecosystems. Estimates of the consequences of rising temperature on current wetland carbon storage and future carbon sequestration potential are summarized. We also demonstrate the need to prevent drying of wetlands and thawing of permafrost by disturbances and rising temperatures to protect wetland carbon stores and climate adaptation/resiliency ecosystem services. Preventing further wetland loss is found to be important in limiting future emissions to meet climate goals, but is seldom considered. In Part 2, the paper explores the policy and management realm from international to national, subnational and local levels to identify strategies and policies reflecting an integrated understanding of both wetland and climate change science.

In the case of offshore storage, unexpected CO2 leakages will acidify the marine environment. Reductions of the pH might be also caused by anthropogenic activities or natural events such as acid spills and dredging operations or storms and floods. Changes in the pH of the marine environment will trigger the mobilisation of elements trapped in contaminated shallow sediments with unclear redox boundary. Trace element (As, Cd, Cr, Cu, Ni, Pb and Zn) release from anoxic and oxic estuarine sediment is analysed and modelled under different laboratory acidification conditions using HNO3 (I) and CO2 (g): acidification at pH = 6.5 as worst-case scenario in events of CO2 leakages and acid spills, and acidification at pH = 7.0 as a seawater scenario under CO2 leakages, acid spills, as well as sediment resuspension. The prediction of metal leaching behaviour appear to require sediment specific and site specific tools. In the present work it is demonstrated that the proposed three in-series reactions model predicts the process kinetics of the studied elements under different simulated environmental conditions (oxidation levels and acid sources). Differences between HNO3 and CO2 acidification are analysed through the influence of the CO2 gas on the ionic competition of the medium. The acidification with CO2 provokes higher released concentrations from the oxic sediment than from the anoxic sediment, except in the case of Zn, which influences the release of the other studied elements. Slight acidification can endanger the aquatic environment through an important mobilisation of contaminants. The obtained prediction of the contaminant release from sediment (kinetic parameters and maximum concentrations) can contribute to the exposure assessment stage for risk management and preincidental planning in accidental CO2 leakages and chemical spills scenarios.

Available data in Thailand indicates a baseline rate of average CO2 emissions of about 300 Mton/year. In this study, we make a quantitative estimation of CO2 emissions in Thailand from a 2015 updating of secondary data collected from biomass and fossil fuel power plants. In addition, this study proposes the creation of CO2 sinks through the geological storage of CO2, known as carbon capture and storage (CCS) technology. The results show that the total CO2 emissions from biomass and fossil fuel power plants are about 1.134 Mton and 105 Mton, respectively. The figures for total amounts of CO2 in onshore and offshore sinks were converted from data in the Department of Mineral Fuel's (DMF) annual report of 2015. These figures are about 165.12 Mton and 2,120 Mton, respectively. Available sedimentation basins both onshore and offshore are selected and suggested as suitable areas for CO2 storage based on the matching of suitable CO2 sources and CO2 sinks.

Methods that are proposed to mitigate CO2 emissions include improving the energy conversion efficiency of fossil fuels, shifting energy production to low carbon sources, enhancing CO2 uptake by terrestrial and marine biomass and capturing CO2 and storing it deep underground. Of all the methods, carbon capture and storage (CCS) deep underground is the best way to reduce atmospheric greenhouse gases which is often responsible for global warming. One of the major issues faced when storing CO2 in depleted oil or gas reservoirs is its leakage through the injection wells. Ordinary Portland Cement (OPC) based well-cement has been used in these oil and gas wells. OPC, however, has issues such as cement degradation, leakage, strength reduction, and durability reduction when used in down-hole environments. Geopolymer can be a good alternative to OPC because of its excellent acid resistance characteristics, high strength and low shrinkage. In a typical wellbore, wellcement will be exposed to saline water that can have different salinity levels. Hence, the main aim of this study was to compare the mechanical behaviours of OPC and geopolymer cement cured in saline water for 7, 28 and 45 days at different salinity levels (0 %, 10 %, 20 %, 30 % and 40 % of NaCl). A series of experiments were conducted to compare the compressive strength and Young's modulus of OPC and geopolymer. It was observed that the compressive strength of OPC based well-cement increases as the salinity level of the brine water is increased up to 10 % NaCl and that it thereafter decreases as the NaCl percentage is further increased. On the other hand, the compressive strength of geopolymer well-cement generally increases as the brine concentration is increased. Based on the findings of this research, it can be concluded that geopolymer as a well-cement can perform better in saline water than OPC based well-cement, and that therefore geopolymer is suitable as a primary well-cement material.",,,,,,,,,2,0,0,0,0,0,2,,,1800-1122,,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Peradeniya, Dept Civil Engn, Colombo, Sri LankaUniv Peradeniya, Dept Civil Engn, Civil Engn, Colombo, Sri Lanka",,,,2018-11-22,WOS:000450114100003,,

Using high-efficient gas chromatography technique we determined content and examined molecular composition of n-alkane fraction of hydrocarbons and phenol compounds of lignin. n-Alkane and phenol concentrations in bottom sediments of all three cores were low both in values per unit mass of sediments and in organic matter composition that is typical for pelagic deposits of the World Ocean. They vary from 0.07 to 2.01 g/g of dry sediment and from 0.0001 to 0.01% of TOC; phenol ranges are from 1.43 to 11.1 g/g and from 0.03 to 0.6%. Non-uniform supply of terrigenous matter to the bottom under conditions of changes in sedimentation environment in different geological epochs is the principal reason for significant variations in n-alkane and lignin concentrations with depth in the cores. Lignin and its derivatives make the main contribution to formation of organic matter composition of the region in study. With respect to n-alkane and lignin concentrations organic matter of deposits of the West European Basin is composed of remains of higher plants and of autochtonous organic matter of marine flora; they have mixed terrigenous-autochtonous (terrigenous-planktonogenic) origin.

If this oil later migrates to the water surface it has the potential for negative environmental impacts. For proper contingency planning and to avoid larger consequences in the environment, it is essential to understand mechanisms and rates for hydrocarbon migration from oil containing sediments to the water surface as well as how much will remain trapped in the sediments. It is believed that the amount of oil transported out of the sediment can be affected by tidal pumping, a common form of subterranean groundwater discharge (SGD). However, we could find no study experimentally investigating the phenomenon of fluid flow in subsea sediments containing oil and the effects of tidal pumping. This study presents an experimental investigation of tidal pumping to determine if it is a possible mechanism that may contribute to the appearance of an oil sheen on the ocean surface above a sediment bed containing oil. An experimental apparatus was constructed of clear PVC pipe allowing for oil migration to be monitored as it flowed out of a sand pack containing oil, while tidal pressure oscillations were applied in three different manners. The effect of tidal pumping was simulated via compression of air above the water (which simulated the increasing static head from tidal exchange). Experimental results show that sustained oil release occurred from all tests, and tests with oscillating pressure produced for longer periods of time. Furthermore, the experimental results showed that the oil migration rate was affected by grain size, oil saturation, and oscillation wave type. In all oscillating experiments the rate and ultimate recovery was less than the comparable static experiments. For the conditions studied, the experimental results indicate that with an oscillating pressure on top of a sand pack, movement of a non-replenishing source of oil is suppressed by pressure oscillation.",,,,,,,,,1,1,0,0,1,0,2,,,1674-487X,1867-111X,,,,,,,,,,"Louisiana State Univ, Dept Petr Engn, Baton Rouge, LA 70803 USA",,,,2017-11-19,WOS:000413013000006,,

The present study also tends to study the difference in the stress level of offshore and onshore employees of the Oil and Gas Industry. Design/methodology/approach The size of the sample for the present study was 202 respondents. It includes 128 onshore employees and 74 offshore employees of oil and gas companies. Respondents were mainly managers and supervisors working in various departments of Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC), Cairn India, Reliance India Ltd (RIL), Bharat Petroleum Corporation Ltd (BPCL) and Indian Oil and Gas Ltd (IOCL). Since the different level of stress is experienced by employees at different stages of the organizational structure, thus study selected population comprising of managers and supervisors since they are believed to face similar work stressors. A variety of statistical tools like mean,t-test, correlation and multi-regression is used for the analysis of collected data. Findings Results show that all six dimensions of workplace spirituality are significantly negatively correlated with stress for onshore employees. However, the sense of community and gratitude are found insignificantly associated with stress for offshore employees. Stressful offshore conditions and excessive specialization might not allow offshore employees to cherish the community at the workplace and also the virtue of gratefulness. The offshore employees might have a certain level of gratitude and community system, but it is not sufficient for the employees to perceive a lower level of work relates to stress. The result gives the impression that the normal working conditions (onshore workplace) provide adequate opportunity to workplace spirituality to transcend its impact on work stress. Originality/value This is one of the pioneer studies that examined the role of workplace spirituality and stress in stress management of offshore and onshore employees of Indian Oil and gas companies.",,,,,,,,,28,0,0,0,1,0,30,,,0953-4814,1758-7816,,,,,,,,,,"Birla Inst Technol Mesra, Noida Off Campus, Noida, IndiaDelhi Technol Univ, Delhi, IndiaGuru Jambheshwar Univ Sci & Technol, Hisar, Haryana, India",,,,2020-07-02,WOS:000541516000001,,

Cyclical oscillations in seabird abundance were apparent in the black-footed albatross (Phoebastria nigripes), and decreasing trends were documented for ashy storm-petrel (Oceanodroma homochroa), pigeon guillemot (Cepphus columbus), rhinoceros auklet (Cerorhinca monocerata), Cassin's auklet (Ptychoramphus aleuticus), and western gull (Lams occidentalis); the sooty shearwater (Puffinus griseus), exhibited a marked decline before signs of recovery at the end of the study period. The abundance of nine other focal species varied with ocean conditions, but without decadal or long-term trends Six of these species have the largest global populations in the CCS, and four are highly energetic, diving foragers. Furthermore, three of the diving species trends were negatively correlated with the abundance of humpback whales in the study area, a direct competitor for the same prey Therefore, on the basis of literature reviewed, we hypothesize that the seabirds were affected by the decreasing carrying capacity of the CCS, over-exploitation of some prey stocks and interference competition from the previously exploited, but now increasing, baleen whale populations Overall, our study highlights the complexity of the ecological factors driving seabird population trends in the highly variable and rapidly changing CCS ecosystem (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd All rights reserved",,,,,,,,,94,0,0,0,77,1,111,,,0079-6611,,,,,,,,,,,"HT Harvey & Associates, Los Gatos, CA 95032 USAHawaii Pacific Univ, Kaneohe, HI 96744 USAOikonos Ecosyst Knowledge, Benicia, CA 94510 USA",HT Harvey & AssociatesHawaii Pacific UnivOikonos Ecosyst Knowledge,,,2010-03-01,WOS:000276145600007,,
