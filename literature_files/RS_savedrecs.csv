In addition to producing oil and gas, these structures inadvertently serve as artificial reef habitat for a variety of GOM fish and invertebrate species. Though many fish species have been reported aggregating near these structures, this study is the first to examine changes in fish community structure in response to the structures' artificial light regimes. Baited remote underwater video (BRUV) surveys were conducted at two lit and three unlit oil and gas platforms off the coast of Louisiana to examine the effect of platform artificial lighting on fish community structure during the day, at night, and during crepuscular periods. Seventeen recreationally harvested species were observed, with red snapper (Lutjanus campechanus) being the most abundant. Statistical analysis indicated that fish community varied significantly with depth, season, type, and season by type interactions. More fish were seen at lit platforms than at unlit platforms, with the majority of individuals identified near the surface. While fish abundance at the surface remained high during the day, the numbers declined at night. This suggests that though fishes are attracted to the vertical relief of the structure, they may be avoiding the artificial light field at the surface either to escape nocturnal predation or to forage away from the platform.",,,,,,,,,20,1,0,0,15,0,22,,,0378-1909,1573-5133,,,,,,,,,,"Louisiana State Univ, Dept Oceanog & Coastal Sci, 2201 Energy Coast & Environm Bldg, Baton Rouge, LA 70803 USALouisiana State Univ, Dept Oceanog & Coastal Sci, 2247 Energy Coast & Environm Bldg, Baton Rouge, LA 70803 USANatl Pk Amer Samoa, MHJ Bldg, Pago Pago, AS 96799 USA",Natl Pk Amer Samoa,,,2018-01-25,WOS:000419462700011,,

Annual commercial landings in the five states bordering the GOM indicate a shift in the fishery from the eastern to the more western GOM since 1970 concomitant with the placement of several thousand oil and gas platforms into the area. Although the addition of considerable complex steel structure to the environment and the shift of the red snapper fishery to Louisiana and Texas may be coincidental, there is still a need to better understand the role of oil and gas platforms in red snapper life history. Quantitative estimates of red snapper associated with platforms have been derived both from assessments of the effects of platform removal via explosives and from hydroacoustic surveys of selected platforms. Based both on these estimates and on the numbers of platforms sited at depth, we estimate from 1.2 to 7.2 million red snapper live around platforms placed at depths of 20 -100 m. Many of these are relatively young individuals of ages 2 - 4 years. These numbers suggest a range of red snapper abundances reflecting the ubiquitous presence of red snapper at oil and gas platforms.

Most previous estimates have come from estuarine environments, generally regarded as one of the most productive ecosystems globally.

Platforms in the Gulf of Mexico are concentrated in the north-central and northwestern regions where few natural reefs exist; they harbor unique communities bearing little resemblance to those in the natural surrounding habitat. There is evidence that the artificial habitat supplied by platforms in the Gulf of Mexico has increased the regional carrying capacity for economically important reef fish species such as red snapper. Platforms in the Gulf of Mexico are customary destinations for both commercial and recreational fishing and Rigs-to-Reefs programs of Gulf States are actively expanding each year. Contrary to the Gulf of Mexico experience, California platforms are concentrated in the Santa Barbara Channel area among natural reefs and offshore islands and they harbor fish assemblages that resemble those found in nearby habitats. Observations at natural reefs and platforms off California found that platforms have become refugia for increasingly rare and overfished species, which is thought to be, in part, a result of light to nonexistent fishing pressure at those platforms.

Using scuba survey data from 11 southern California platforms from 1995 to 2000, we examined fish assemblages associated with structural elements of the structure, including the major horizontal crossbeams outside of the jacket, vertical jacket legs, and horizontal crossbeams that span the jacket interior. Patterns of habitat association were examined among three depth zones: shallow (<16.8 m), midwater (16.8-26 m), and deep (>26 m); and between two life stages: youngof-the-year and non-young-of-the-year. Fish densities tended to be greatest along horizontal beams spanning the jacket interior, relative to either horizontal or vertical beams along the jacket exterior, indicating that the position of the habitat within the overall structure is an important characteristic affecting fish habitat use. Fish densities were also higher in transects centered directly over a vertical or horizontal beam relative to transects that did not contain a structural element.

The model proposed is a new simplified tool used to study the structural analysis of the jacket structure, developed and summarized in 10 steps, firstly adopted to study the behavior of the oil and gas structure and then for the retrofitted wind tower configuration.",,,,,,,,,20,3,0,0,1,0,20,,,1996-1073,,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Bologna, DICAM Dept, I-40136 Bologna, ItalyUniv Porto, Fac Engn FEUP, PT-4200465 Porto, Portugal",,,,2019-03-28,WOS:000460667700085,,

As of 2019, there are 27 platforms in state and federal waters off California, and the decommissioning of some of these platforms is imminent. Thus, consideration of whether to completely remove a platform or cut it off at some depth below the sea surface and retain the submerged portion as a reef is a decision that will occur in the near future. The objectives of the 10 papers in this dedicated issue of the Bulletin of Marine Science are to: (1) increase scientific understanding of the inter-and intrarelationships of fish and invertebrate populations at offshore oil and gas platforms and natural reefs within the Southern California Bight; (2) determine the extent of influence of platform assemblages on southern California and the Pacific coast populations of fishes and invertebrates; and (3) synthesize relevant reports, existing peer-reviewed literature, and new data analyses into a single peer-reviewed reference. This introductory paper contains a synopsis of all extant California platforms including information on: (1) the original operator, (2) the current operator of records, (3) the date the platform was installed, (4) the first production date, (5) the platform's distance from shore [including whether it is state or outer continental shelf (OCS) waters], (6) the bottom depth of the platform, (7) the number of well slots, (8) the number of conductors, (9) what the platform produces (oil and/or gas), (10) the platform jacket dimensions [generally at the seafloor (bottom)], (11) the platform's footprint, (12) the midwater surface area, (13) the total removal weight, (14) the platform location, (15) the shell mound size, (16) the shell mound volume, (17) the shell mound height, (18) the center of the shell mound location, and (19) the bottom slope.

While the assemblages of both platforms were dominated by rockfishes (Sebastes spp.), there were also significant differences. Compared to Gail, Eureka: (1) exhibited higher densities of all species combined and of most species in common, (2) had more mature individuals of most species, (3) exhibited greater species richness, and (4) had higher densities of species typical of complex high relief.

Platform jackets, conductors, and shell mounds often host a diverse and productive marine community, and among the myriad considerations associated with decommissioning planning, platform operators and federal and state regulatory agencies will consider the ecological value of existing underwater structures as artificial reefs. In the event of partial removal of platform structure, fish assemblages on decommissioned platforms may remain unchanged in areas where structure is left intact. However, on the seafloor beneath the platforms, a mound of debris often called the shell mound will likely change over time if the supply of falling mussels and other organisms from the productive surface part of the structure is removed. In this study, we review shell mound research relevant to decommissioning, including mound formation, contaminant loads, associated biological communities, and transitions following the removal of platform structures at four sites. To address the gap in knowledge of shell mound fish community structure, we used manned submersible and remotely operated vehicle surveys from 1997 to 2013 to estimate the biomass, density, species composition and similarity between shell mounds at 22 southern California platforms.

In July 1998, we collected morphometric data and sagittal otoliths from 300 red snapper randomly selected from among the mortalities manifested subsequent to the explosive removal of an obsolete gas platform. Ages estimated from counts of otolith annuli ranged from 1 to 9 years among these specimens. The virtual absence of age-1 red snapper (0.68%) and the preponderance of age-2 red snapper (53%) at the platform demonstrate that red snapper recruit to platforms sometime during their second year. Truncation of the age distribution results from natural mortality, fishing mortality and emigration to other habitats after several years of residency. Assuming this population to be typical, the age distributions of the commercial and recreational harvests suggest that oil and gas platforms serve as essential habitats for younger red snapper.

We broadly review the environmental effects of decommissioning, analyse case studies, and outline analytical approaches that can advance our understanding of ecological dynamics on oil and gas structures. We find that ecosystem functions and services increase with the age of the structure and vary with geographical setting, such that decommissioning decisions need to take an ecosystem approach that considers their broader habitat and biodiversity values. Alignment of decommissioning assessment priorities among regulators and how they are evaluated, will reduce the likelihood of variable and sub-optimal decommissioning decisions. Ultimately, the range of allowable decommissioning options must be expanded to optimise the environmental outcomes of decommissioning across the broad range of ecosystems in which platforms are located.

California may permit some portion of the structures of offshore oil and gas platforms to remain in place if a net benefit to the marine environment can be demonstrated. Here we assess habitats at 23 oil and gas platforms in terms of site- and species-specific estimates of potential reproductive output. We identified 17 fish species (15 rockfishes Sebastes spp.) that have potential reproductive output densities (no. eggs m(-2)) on individual platforms that were tens to hundreds of times their average on natural reefs in the study area, with the highest potential reproductive output values being observed on platforms for all but two of these species. These extreme values were typically observed in platform base habitats, and likely result from the combined effects of high levels of fish recruitment to midwater platform habitats, relatively low fishing activity on these structures, and ontogenetic habitat use (depth-specific) patterns that make some platforms better habitats for some species based on the seafloor depth where they are sited. However, spatial variability was also very high across both platform and natural reef sites, induding reproductive potential for almost all focal species being zero at the majority of surveyed sites. The contribution of fish reproductive potential to the discussion of decommissioning alternatives should therefore be considered on a case-by-case basis for each platform in California.",,,,,,,,,9,0,0,0,7,0,9,,,0007-4977,1553-6955,,,,,,,,,,"Calif State Polytech Univ Pomona, Dept Biol Sci, Pomona, CA 91786 USAOccidental Coll, Vantuna Res Grp, Los Angeles, CA 90041 USAUniv Calif Santa Barbara, Marine Sci Inst, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA",,,,2019-10-22,WOS:000489628300003,,

The trajectories originated at Platform Irene, located west of Point Conception, California, during two recruiting.seasons for bocaccio (Sebastes paucispinis): May through August, 1999 and 2002. Given that pelagic juvenile bocaccio dwell near the surface, the trajectories estimate transport to habitat. We assumed that appropriate shallow water juvenile habitat exists inshore of the 50-m isobath. Results from 1999 indicated that 10% of the trajectories represent transport to habitat, whereas 76% represent transport across the offshore boundary. For 2002, 24% represent transport to habitat, and 69% represent transport across the offshore boundary. Remaining trajectories (14% and 7% for 1999 and 2002, respectively) exited the coverage area either northward or southward along isobaths. Deployments of actual drifters (with 1-m drogues) from a previous multiyear study provided measurements originating near Platform Irene from May through August. All but a few of the drifters moved offshore, as was also shown with the HF radar-derived trajectories. These results indicate that most juvenile bocaccio settling on the platform would otherwise have been transported offshore and perished in the absence of a platform.

Multi-seasonal sampling was conducted at one of the oil platforms located in the central North Sea between September 2010 and January 2014 to characterise temporal variation in the stomach contents of different fish species. A total of 6 fish species were recorded, including commercially important gadoids such as saithe Pollachius virens, haddock Melanogrammus aeglefinus and cod Gadus morhua. Saithe fed predominantly on euphausiids and haddock consumed a large proportion of ophiuroids, whereas cod were mainly piscivorous. The prey compositions were significantly different between species, indicating the presence of interspecific prey resource partitioning among those species. To further investigate possible links between the feeding habits of the most dominant fish species, saithe, and the physical presence of offshore platforms across the North Sea, a separate set of stomach data was collected during the 2012 Quarter 3 International Bottom Trawl Survey aboard the FRV `Scotia'. The multivariate analysis of both data sets showed that the observed spatio-temporal variability in the saithe diet was significantly explained by proximity to the nearest offshore platforms and changes in water temperatures, which appear to reflect patterns of euphausiid availability over space and time. The physical presence of the offshore structures may potentially affect the distribution/availability of zooplankton (i.e. euphausiids) and thereby influence the feeding behaviour of saithe and any other marine populations that are interconnected to the dynamics of such trophic interactions.",,,,,,,,,11,0,1,0,7,0,13,,,0171-8630,1616-1599,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Aberdeen, Sch Biol Sci, Oceanlab, Main St, Newburgh AB41 6AA, Aberdeen, Scotland",,,,2016-01-19,WOS:000368922900013,,

The 108 day-night samples collected alongside (vertical tows) and nearby (surface and oblique tows) platforms yielded 1526 larval and early juvenile fishes representing 55 taxa from 45 families. Epipelagic/mesopelagic taxa dominated the catches, whereas hard/soft habitat-associated taxa were uncommon. Carangidae (36.2%) and Myctophidae (31.5%) dominated in summer and winter, respectively. The most abundant taxon was Trachurus declivis (Carangidae, 35.1%), followed by Bovichtus angustifrons (Bovichtidae, 8.7%), Scomberesox saurus (Scomberesocidae. 3.7%), Centroberyx affinis (Berycidae, 3.0%) and Arripis trutta (Arripidae, 1.7%). Fish concentrations (nos. per 100 in 3) alongside platforms did not differ significantly between day and night across all surveys. Likewise, concentrations nearby platforms in February 1999, including those of T. declivis, did not vary significantly by tow type (surface vs. oblique) or day vs. night. The far greater diversity and abundance recorded in February 1999 are likely the result of upwelling conditions over the eastern Bass Strait shelf during the sampling period, and which were not detected in February 1998. In the absence of data on adult fishes associated with the Bass Strait platforms, and given the limited availability of reefs directly around the area, it could be argued that some of the taxa caught may originate from spawning around neighboring natural reefs, particularly those off the Gippsland coastline and the south-east corner of mainland Australia. However, the prime position of the platforms almost right in the center of a productivity hotspot would have a confounding effect on the potential source(s) of larval fishes in that region of south-eastern Australia. The role of platforms as potential de-facto reefs for juvenile fishes in Bass Strait, as well as spawning areas, is discussed based on the findings of this study, the first on early stages of fishes around oil and gas platforms in Australia.

L. pertusa was positively identified on 13 of 14 platforms examined using existing oil and gas industry visual inspections. Two platforms were inspected in more detail to examine depth and colony size distributions. We recorded 947 colonies occurring between 59 and 132 in depth that coincides with cold Atlantic water at depths below the summer thermocline in the northern North Sea. We suggest that these colonies provide evidence for a planktonic larval stage of L. pertusa with recruits initially originating from populations in the north-east Atlantic and now self recruiting to the platforms. Size class distribution showed a continuous range of size classes, but with few outlying large colonies. The break between the largest colonies and the rest of the population is considered as the point when colonies began self recruiting to the platforms, resulting in greater colonization success. We present the first documented in situ colony growth rate estimate (26 +/- 5 mm yr(-1)) for L. pertusa based on 15 colonies from the Tern Alpha platform with evidence for yearly recruitment events starting the year the platform was installed. Evidence of contamination from drill muds and cuttings was observed on the Heather platform but appeared limited to regions close to drilling discharge points, where colonies experience partial as well as whole colony mortality.

Forty-four taxa from 19 families were observed over all platforms and all gears. More taxa were observed within the confines of the platforms and in close proximity to the platforms than were observed away from the platforms. Camera orientation was important in detecting some species (e.g., groupers were only observed within the confines of the platforms). The number of taxa observed did not vary with depth or among platforms; however, there were differences in fish density with depth and among platforms.

Over the course of their decades-long life-spans, these platforms become ecologically important artificial reefs, supporting a variety of marine life. When offshore platforms are no longer active they are decommissioned, which usually requires the removal of the entire platform from the marine environment, destroying the artificial reef that has been created and potentially resulting in the loss of important ecosystem services. While some countries allow for these platforms to be converted into artificial reefs under Rigs-to-Reefs programs, they face significant resistance from various stakeholders. The presence of offshore platforms and the associated marine life alters the ecosystem from that which existed prior to the installation of the platform, and there may be factors which make restoration of the ecosystem unfeasible or even detrimental to the environment. In these cases, a novel ecosystem has emerged with potentially significant ecological value. In restoration ecology, ecosystems altered in this way can be classified and managed using the novel ecosystems concept, which recognizes the value of the new ecosystem functions and services and allows for the ecosystem to be managed in its novel state, instead of being restored. Offshore platforms can be assessed under the novel ecosystems concept using existing decommissioning decision analysis models as a base.

Light traps fished at the surface, as opposed to at-depth, collected greater CPUEs and greater diversity of larval and juvenile fishes. Of the dominant taxa collected by light traps, clupeids, engraulids, synodonfids, and presettlement blenniids were most common in surface waters within the platform, while postflexion sconibrids and settlement-size blenniids and pomacentrids were most common in surface waters down-current of the platforms. Deep plankton nets collected greater densities of non-clupeiform larval fishes, although surface plankton nets collected greater numbers of taxa. The vertical distribution patterns described for dominant larval fish collected by plankton nets were generally consistent with those from other studies, i.e. clupeid, carangid, sciaenid and scombrid larvae more abundant in surface waters at platforms, and synodontid, bregmacerotid, gobiid and bothid larvae more abundant in deeper waters. Oil and gas platforms likely impact larval and juvenile fish populations, particularly considering their proliferation in the Gulf (i.e., over 4000 platforms).

The composition of invertebrate assemblages varied significantly among the four regions, reflecting differences in the relative abundances of certain anemone, bryozoan, sponge, and bivalve taxa. However, invertebrate assemblages varied idiosyncratically among platforms within a region. Variation in platform assemblages was associated with SST across regions; however, assemblages of platforms in the southeast Santa Barbara Channel were distinct due to the high cover of a non-native bryozoan, Watersipora subatra (Ortmann, 1890). The existence of geographical patterns in the composition of platform invertebrate assemblages and the colonization of one platform by a native bryozoan with southern affinities during elevated SST of 2014-2015 suggest that these assemblages may be useful over broad spatial scales as barometers of short- and longer-term changes in ocean climate.

Because their decommissioning involves large costs and potential environmental impacts, this became an issue of public controversy. As part of a larger policy analysis conducted for the State of California, we implemented a decision analysis as a software tool (PLATFORM) to clarify and evaluate decision strategies against a comprehensive set of objectives. Key options selected for in-depth analysis are complete platform removal and partial removal to 85 feet below the water line, with the remaining structure converted in place to an artificial reef to preserve the rich ecosystems supported by the platform's support structure. PLATFORM was instrumental in structuring and performing key analyses of the impacts of each option (e.g., on costs, fishery production, air emissions) and dramatically improved the team's productivity. Sensitivity analysis found that disagreement about preferences, especially about the relative importance of strict compliance with lease agreements, has much greater effects on the preferred option than does uncertainty about specific outcomes, such as decommissioning costs. It found a near-consensus of stakeholders in support of partial removal and rigs-to-reefs program. The project's results played a role in the decision to pass legislation enabling an expanded California rigs-to-reefs program that includes a mechanism for sharing cost savings between operators and the state.

Also, the potential impact of those platforms on the sediment quality was investigated. Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons diagnostic ratios observed in the sediment samples indicated hydrocarbons from pyrogenic source, specifically from biomass combustion. Trace elements As, Cd and Ba recorded concentrations higher than Threshold Effect Levels (TEL) in the sediment nearby the platforms. Also, there was evidence of some samples enriched by barium. Although As, Cd and Ba concentrations were higher than TEL, they most likely corresponded to background levels.

To explore potential effects, a meta-analysis of studies that have examined the abundance of finfish inside of wind farms compared to nearby reference sites was conducted. Using well-established meta-analytic methods, the overall effect size across all studies was calculated, and then changes in effect size for soft-bottom and complex-bottom oriented species were explored in association with several covariates including characteristics of the wind farm (depth, distance from shore, wind farm age), the sampling design (season, gear type, and distance from the turbine sampled), and ecosystem level characteristics (functional feeding group and fishing presence/absence). The overall effect size was positive and significantly different from zero, indicating greater abundance of fish inside of wind farms. Likewise, positive and significant effect sizes were noted for several covariates for both soft-bottom and complex-bottom species.

The decision to remove such structures or turn them into reefs (i.e. 'rigs-to-reefs') hinges on the habitat value they provide, yet this can rarely be determined because the residency of mobile species is difficult to establish. Here, we test a novel solution to this problem for reef fishes; the use of otolith (earstone) properties to identify oil structures of residence. We compare the otolith microchemistry and otolith shape of a site-attached coral reef fish (Pseudanthias rubrizonatus) among four oil structures (depth 82-135 m, separated by 9.7-84.2 km) on Australia's North West Shelf to determine if populations developed distinct otolith properties during their residency. Microchemical signatures obtained from the otolith edge using laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS) differed among oil structures, driven by elements Sr, Ba and Mn, and to a lesser extent Mg and Fe. A combination of microchemical data from the otolith edge and elliptical Fourier (shape) descriptors allowed allocation of individuals to their 'home' structure with moderate accuracy (overall allocation accuracy: 63.3%, range: 45.5-78.1%), despite lower allocation accuracies for each otolith property in isolation (microchemistry: 47.5%, otolith shape: 45%). Site-specific microchemical signatures were also stable enough through time to distinguish populations during 3 separate time periods, suggesting that residence histories could be recreated by targeting previous growth zones in the otolith. Our results indicate that reef fish can develop unique otolith properties during their residency on oil structures which may be useful for assessing the habitat value of individual structures. The approach outlined here may also be useful for determining the residency of reef fish on artificial reefs, which would assist productivity assessments of these habitats. (c) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

With the global trends in green energy, Taiwan are actively promoting the Thousand Wind Turbines Project from 2012. Up to now, there are three met masts in different offshore demonstration wind farms established in 2015 and two mono-pile foundations completed in 2016. The objective is to install about 800 offshore wind turbines, and 450 onshore wind turbines prior to the year of 2030. However, the planned location for potential offshore wind farms is close to the habitat of the Sousa chinensis (also called Indo-Pacific Humpback Dolphin or Chinese White Dolphin). Pile driving noise or operation noise have shown to cause behavioural disturbance or auditory damage to marine mammals. At a distance that is considered safe from PTS and TTS, noises from impact or vibratory pile driver are still high enough to disturb the behavior of marine mammals. In this study, underwater ambient noise measurements are shown to enhance the understanding of the soundscapes of the planned location for potential offshore wind farms. In the meantime, pile-driving noise measurements of two mono-pile foundations are made in 2016.

In this context, two steps will be considered: defining the life-cycle phases of a floating offshore wind farm (conception and definition, design and development, manufacturing, installation, exploitation, and dismantling) and estimating costs for each phase, whose value will be established as constant or dependent on the particular point of the geography. The result of the tool will be a geo-referenced map of the total cost implied in the development of a floating offshore wind farm. The methodology will be applied to a particular location, Galicia (NW of Spain), where offshore depth and wind resource satisfy the necessary conditions for this type of offshore energy installation. The study will be developed for a semisubmersible floating offshore wind platform and a general offshore wind turbine of 5 MW. The farm will be composed of 21 offshore wind turbines, with a total power of 107 MW. Results show the cost maps of each defined phase and the total cost, which is from 366 to 946 M depending on the location (deep, distance from shore, among others), of the life-cycle of a floating offshore wind farm.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,2211-0577,,978-3-319-06305-8; 978-3-319-06304-1,,,,,,,,,"Univ A Coruna, Dept Naval & Ocean Engn, Integrated Grp Engn Res GII, Ferrol 15403, A Coruna, Spain",,,,2015-09-02,WOS:000358769900018,,

Stereo-video and Gat. cameras were used to profile the water column to estimate the number, length, and species composition of fishes present on the platforms. Hydroacoustics were used to determine the spatial distribution, both in distance and depth, of relative fish biomass, or mean volume backscatter, within 500 m of the center of each site. Mean volume backscatter (MVBS, S-v) was highest near the structure, then declined rapidly with distance. We estimated that background-noise level was obtained at similar to 100 m from the structures. Fish MVBS was highest in the lower water column (> 60 m depth), compared to 0-30 m and 30-60 m depth zones. Fish communities differed among depth layers, seasonally, and between structure types (standing/toppled), though red snapper (Luilanus campechanus) was the dominant species present at both structure types. Coupled video sampling revealed that MVBS changed little seasonally, but different species contributed to community structure seasonally and among layers in the water column. This study is one of several studies to use video data combined with acoustics to describe species contribution to acoustic biomass at standing and toppled platforms. We contend that integrating these non-destructive sampling methods is an important step in understanding the efficacy of artificial structures as ecological valuable habitat.",,,,,,,,,24,1,0,0,21,0,30,,,0165-7836,1872-6763,,,,,,,,,,"Louisiana State Univ, Dept Oceanog & Coastal Sci, Baton Rouge, LA 70803 USASt Marys Coll Maryland, Dept Biol, St Marys City, MD 20686 USAUniv Washington, Sch Fisheries & Aquat Sci, Seattle, WA 98195 USANatl Marine Fisheries Serv, Portland Reg Off, Sustainable Fisheries Div, 1201 NE Lloyd Blvd,Suite 1100, Portland, OR 97232 USA",St Marys Coll Maryland,,,2018-04-05,WOS:000427668900007,,

The growth of these facilities, however, is limited by the lack of inexpensive land near major population centers and the visual impact caused by large wind turbines.Wind energy generated from floating offshore wind farms is the next frontier. Vast sea areas with stronger and steadier winds are available for wind farm development and 5 MW wind turbine towers located 20 miles from the coastline are invisible. Current offshore wind turbines are supported by monopoles driven into the seafloor or other bottom mounted structures at coastal sites a few miles from shore and in water depths of 10-15 m. The primary impediment to their growth is their prohibitive cost as the water depth increases.This article discusses the technologies and the economics associated with the development of motion resistant floating offshore wind turbines drawing upon a seven-year research effort at MIT Two families of floater concepts are discussed, inspired by developments in the oil and gas industry for the deep water exploration of hydrocarbon reservoirs. The interaction of the floater response dynamics in severe weather with that of the wind turbine system is addressed and the impact of this coupling on the design of the new generation of multi-megawatt wind turbines for offshore deployment is discussed.

Since fields are ageing, the amount of gas available for electric power production is declining. One common alternative is to feed those gas turbines with fuel diesel, which is an expensive solution at remote locations and has a high carbon footprint. Since oil and gas platforms often operate in deep waters and are exposed to energetic wave climates, ocean wave energy can be used in their electrification. Even though wave energy is not yet cost competitive for suppling onshore grids, power supplying remote oil and gas platforms might be the niche market enabler to launch commercially the sector, due to the high cost of the electricity produced in those offshore facilities and the abundance of wave resource at most of their locations. This paper proposes a new techno-economic model to assess and scale wave energy converters to match the local wave climate at their deployment site, while maximizing the income of the wave farm and accounting for their life cycle costs. At the same time, the economic feasibility of providing electricity from ocean waves to remote offshore oil and gas facilities is analysed using as case study an oil and gas platform in operation at the North Sea. Seven wave energy converters were assessed at the case study site and it was proved that its hydrodynamic performance is not directly linked to its economics attractiveness. The values of the levelized cost of energy ranged from 188 to 471 (Sic)/MWh and were benchmarked against reference values.

The local government has developed a series of measures to promote the development of wind power generation industry. The development of offshore wind farm in Taiwan, however, has to solve the problems that offshore wind farms are overlapping with some traditional fishing grounds and are unable to reach consensus with relevant stakeholders. This paper starts from the great potential of offshore wind power in Taiwan and the active promotion of the government, and analyses the impact and possible opportunities brought by offshore wind farm development to local fisheries, from the perspective of Zhanghua Area, a key area of development of offshore wind farm in Taiwan. This paper proposes that the local government in Taiwan should use marine spatial planning as a tool, through the comprehensive participation of government, developers, fishermen and other bodies, seeking the coexistence and prosperity of offshore wind farm and fisheries. Avoidance, compensation, and feedback, as well as communication and collaboration will be an important strategy to solve the conflicts of multiple use of the sea and to promote the development of marine renewable energy.

The effects on marine top predators from displacement from important habitat are key concerns during offshore wind farm construction and operation. In this respect, we present evidence for no significant displacement from a UK offshore wind farm for two broadly distributed species of conservation concern: common guillemot (Uria aalge) and harbor porpoise (Phocoena phocoena). Data were collected during boat-based line transect surveys across a 360 km(2) study area that included the Robin Rigg offshore wind farm. Surveys were conducted over 10 years across the preconstruction, construction, and operational phases of the development. Changes in guillemot and harbor porpoise abundance and distribution in response to offshore wind farm construction and operation were estimated using generalized mixed models to test for evidence of displacement. Both common guillemot and harbor porpoise were present across the Robin Rigg study area throughout all three development phases. There was a significant reduction in relative harbor porpoise abundance both within and surrounding the Robin Rigg offshore wind farm during construction, but no significant difference was detected between the preconstruction and operational phases. Relative common guillemot abundance remained similar within the Robin Rigg offshore wind farm across all development phases. Offshore wind farms have the potential to negatively affect wildlife, but further evidence regarding the magnitude of effect is needed. The empirical data presented here for two marine top predators provide a valuable addition to the evidence base, allowing future decision making to be improved by reducing the uncertainty of displacement effects and increasing the accuracy of impact assessments.",,,,,,,,,9,0,0,0,6,0,11,,,2045-7758,,,,,,,,,,,"Nat Power, Stirling, ScotlandQueens Crescent, Falkirk, Scotland",Nat PowerQueens Crescent,,,2017-11-23,WOS:000414873600003,29152170,

From 2012 to 2017, we conducted four ship-based surveys of CH4 in the seawater column and boundary layer of the Bohai Sea, China, and further measured CO2 and several meteorological parameters. The average observed CH4 mixing ratios in the boundary layer and its concentrations in seawater column were 1950 +/- 46 ppb in November 2012 (dissolved CH4 was not observed in this survey), 2222 +/- 109 ppb and 13.0 +/- 5.9 nmol/ L in August 2014, 2014 +/- 20 ppb and 5.4 +/- 1.4 nmol/L in February 2017, and 1958 +/- 25 ppb and 5.3 +/- 3.8 nmol/L in May 2017, respectively. The results demonstrated that the CH4 emissions from the oil and gas platforms accounted for approximately 72.5 +/- 27.0% of the increase in the background atmospheric CH4 in the local area. The remaining emissions were attributed to landesea air mass transportation. Conversely, the influence of the airesea exchange was negligible, measuring within the 10(-3) ppb range. For carbon balance calibration, the mean flaring efficiency of the oil-associated gas based on the enhancement of CO2 (Delta CO2) and enhancement sum of CO2 and CH4 (Delta CO2 + Delta CH4) was 98.5 +/- 0.5%. Furthermore, the CH4 emission rate from the oil and gas platforms was 0.026 +/- 0.017 Tg/year, which was approximately 7.2 times greater than the sea-to-air CH4 flux over the entire Bohai Sea area. Thus, oil and gas platforms must be recognized as important artificial hotspot sources of atmospheric CH4 in the Bohai Sea. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

In addition, spot prawns, Pandalus platyceros Brandt, 1851, and the sea urchin Strongylocentrotus fragilis Jackson, 1912, were abundant at a few shell mounds, and large masses of the non-native foliose bryozoan, Watersipora subtorquata (d'Orbigny, 1852), were observed at one platform. Brittle stars were also abundant in patches on some shell mounds. Over all, echinoderms were the most abundant taxa, with eight taxa of sea stars comprising 77% of the total number of organisms counted individually.

This paper presents an introduction to-issues that influence how design and construction experience from the O&G industry can be used to aid foundation design for offshore wind energy converters. A history of the evolution of foundation and substructure concepts in the Gulf of Mexico and North Sea is presented, followed by a discussion of soil behavior and the influence of regional geology on these developments. Mechanisms that influence the resistance of shallow and deep foundations for fixed and floating offshore structures are outlined so that areas of empiricism within offshore design codes can be identified and properly modified for application to offshore wind turbine foundations. It is concluded that there are distinct differences between offshore O&G and offshore wind turbine foundations, and application of continued research into foundation behavior is necessary for rational, reliable, and cost-effective design.",,,,,,,,,21,0,0,0,2,0,25,,,0025-3324,1948-1209,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Wisconsin, Madison, WI 53706 USAUniv Western Australia, Ctr Offshore Fdn Syst, Crawley, WA 6009, Australia",,,,2010-01-01,WOS:000276062400005,,

The wind farm was brought into full operation in December 2003. At six stations, acoustic porpoise detectors (T-PODs) were placed inside the wind farm area and at a reference area 10 km to the east, to monitor porpoise echolocation activity as a proxy of porpoise presence. A modified statistical BACI design was applied to detect changes in porpoise presence before, during and after construction of the wind farm. The results show that the echolocation activity has significantly declined inside Nysted Offshore Wind Farm since the baseline in 2001-2 and has not fully recovered yet. The echolocation activity inside the wind farm has been gradually increasing (from 11% to 29% of the baseline level) since the construction of the wind farm, possibly due to habituation of the porpoises to the wind farm or enrichment of the environment due to reduced fishing and to artificial reef effects.",,,,,,,,,53,0,0,0,39,0,56,,,1748-9326,,,,,,,,,,,"Aarhus Univ, Dept Biosci, DK-4000 Roskilde, Denmark",,,,2013-02-05,WOS:000312696400049,,

As a response to the present climate crisis focus on wind energy is increasing due to its renewable and environmentally friendly characteristics. Due to social and political reasons the trend has been shifted largely from onshore to offshore wind farms. Offshore wind energy production faces a wide range of new challenges in design, development, manufacturing, installation, and maintenance and operation. The need, objectives, method, benefits, and application of a proposed reliability and maintainability database are identified in this paper. In the offshore oil and gas industry the OREDA concept for data collection has been running for more than 25 years. Therefore it will be briefly described what is considered to be the state of the art in this industry when it comes to data collection. Potential challenges and issues pertaining to the reliability and maintainability data collection of offshore wind turbines are outlined and categorized. The architecture of the proposed database is illustrated. The main building blocks of the database are briefly described and their possible effects on the reliability and maintainability of offshore wind turbines are highlighted. It is expected that the realization of the proposed database will open a new vista of knowledge in understanding the real behavior of offshore wind turbines in the marine environment. Another expectation is the benefits it will bring to the technological areas ranging from design to operation. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

If significant contamination is occurring, it would be expected to impair the reproductive abilities of impacted fishes. One form of reproductive impairment is atresia, the abnormal reabsorption of oocytes that are destined to be spawned. Atresia has been widely used as an indicator of pollutant-related reproductive impairment in fishes.

Calls to relax complete removal requirements in some circumstances and allow part of an O&G installation to be left in the marine environment are increasing. Yet knowledge regarding the biological communities that develop on these structures and their ecological role in the North Sea is currently insufficient to inform such decommissioning decisions. To focus debate regarding decommissioning policy and guide ecological research, we review environmental policy objectives in the region, summarize existing knowledge regarding ecological aspects of decommissioning for both O&G and OWF installations, and identify approaches to address knowledge gaps through science-industry collaboration. We find that in some cases complete removal will conflict with other policies regarding protection and restoration of reefs, as well as the conservation of species within the region. Key ecological considerations that are rarely considered during decommissioning decisions are: (i) provision of reef habitat, (ii) productivity of offshore ecosystems, (iii) enhancement of biodiversity, (iv) protection of the seabed from trawling, and (v) enhancement of connectivity.

Offshore wind turbine support structures are mainly fabricated of welded tubular members, similar to structures used for oil and gas applications, and are exposed to highly dynamic, harsh marine environments. However, their structural details and design requirements are significantly different due to the magnitude and frequency of operational and environmental loadings acting on the support structures. These conditions would significantly affect their structural dynamic response characteristics due to the magnitude of the applied load. This may therefore have some significant effects on the crack growth behaviour and the extent to which corrosion can be associated with damage to the support structures. However, the magnitude of the applied load might depend on turbine size, water depth, soil conditions and type of support structures. It is therefore essential to design wind turbine support structures against prescribed limit states to ensure economical and safe operation. This paper presents a review of corrosion fatigue in offshore structures as regards the effects of seawater, environment and mechanical loading. Existing literature which documents results from previous campaigns is presented, including works referring to oil and gas structures, highlighting the significant difference in the aspects of loading and use of modern fabrication processes, with a view to illustrating the requirements for an update to the existing corrosion fatigue database that will suit offshore wind structures' design requirements.

Although offshore wind farms have been developed in Europe and Asia, the Block Island Wind Farm (BIWF) is the first offshore wind farm built in North America. To improve marine resource management, it is critical to understand the impacts of the wind farm on marine resource users in context. Little is known about the impacts of offshore wind farms on marine resource users in the United States. This study investigates recreational and commercial fishers' perceptions of the impacts of the BIWF on the local marine ecosystem. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 25 fishers, mostly based out of Block Island or Point Judith, Rhode Island (US), in the summer and fall of 2017. During the interviews, fishers were asked about their perceptions of changes in the marine ecology of the wind farm area during and after the offshore wind turbines were constructed, and how their activities in the area have changed since the wind farm was installed. Results indicate that there were perceived impacts of the BIWF on the local ecosystem and the behavior of the marine resource users. For some recreational fishers, the wind farm functioned as a destination or target and served as an artificial reef for spearfishing. For some commercial fishers, the increase in recreational fishing due to the establishment of the BIWF crowded out commercial fishers in these areas.

These platforms provide hard substratum that extends throughout the euphotic zone, in a region where such has been rare in recent geological time. Major exceptions to this are coral reefs of the Flower Garden Banks (FGB), similar to200 km S-SE of Galveston, Texas, USA. We determined whether extensive scleractinian coral populations had colonized these platforms, quantified them, and determined their population and community characteristics. We also examined the relationship between these variables and distance from the FGB, platform age and depth. Surveys were performed on 13 oil or gas production platforms down to 36 m depth, encompassing an ellipse around the FGB. Corals occurred in abundance on most of the platforms. We found 11 species, comprising 8 hermatypic scleractinians, 2 ahermatypic scleractinians and 1 hydrozoan coral. The most abundant corals were Madracis decactis, Diploria strigosa and Tubastraea coccinea. Distance from the FGB was not related to the coral community variables measured, including total coral abundances of the dominant 3 species in shallow water (<14 m), deep water (14 to 36 m), or both depths combined. Total coral abundance increased significantly with increasing platform age, and the community was best developed on platforms >12 to 15 yr old. Abundance of M. decactis increased significantly with increasing platform age in deeper water and both depths combined, as did coral species diversity (S). This was not the case with D. strigosa, indicating that it may not be associated with any particular successional sere. Neither was T coccinea abundance associated with platform age, except in shallow water, where it decreased in abundance with increasing age, indicating that this species may be an opportunistic pioneer species. All corals combined exhibited a significantly non-uniform depth distribution, with total coral abundance peaking at similar to20 and 28 m depths. M. decactis exhibited a similar bimodal depth distribution, with a disproportionately high peak at depths > 27 m. D. strigosa exhibited peaks at similar to10 and 23 m depth and was not found at depths > 27 m. T coccinea exhibited a near-normal distribution, with a mode at similar to17 m depth. Platforms have facilitated the expansion of coral populations in the GOM. Such platforms possess an intrinsic environmental value through the presence of coral populations, and this may influence future decisions regarding their removal.",,,,,,,,,116,7,0,0,104,3,144,,,0171-8630,1616-1599,,,,,,,,,,"Louisiana Univ Marine Consortium, Chauvin, LA 70344 USALouisiana State Univ, Dept Oceanog & Coastal Sci, Baton Rouge, LA 70803 USAUS Dept Interiro, Minerals Management Serv, New Orleans, LA 70123 USA",Louisiana Univ Marine ConsortiumUS Dept Interiro,,,2004-01-01,WOS:000225268500011,,

With the upcoming era of decommissioning of oil and gas structures, it is timely to assess the usefulness of this footage for researching these communities. We used ROV inspection footage to characterize the sessile invertebrates and fishes associated with the Goodwyn Alpha Production Platform (GWA) on the North West Shelf of Australia between depths of 10 and 125 m during 2006 and 2008. Depth was a major driver of invertebrate assemblages, most likely due to specific requirements such as light, and differences between years were most likely from the physical detachment of species by cyclones and internal waves. Phototrophic species were mostly limited to the upper 50 m of the platform, including the hard coral Pociiopora sp. and the soft corals Nephthea sp. and Scleronephthya sp. In contrast, heterotrophic species including sponges, anemones, bryozoans, hydroids, bivalves such as Lopha folium and the hard coral Tubastrea spp., were distributed across all depths. We observed 1791 fish from at least 10 families and 19 species, including commercial species such as crimson seaperch (Lutjanus erythropterus), red emperor (L. sebae), saddle-tailed seaperch (L. malabaricus), mangrove jack (L. argentimaculatus) and trevally (Caranx spp.). Fish density increased significantly with depth during 2008, from a mean of 23 fish/50 m(2) between 10 and 25 m to 3373 fish/50 m(2) at 125 m, where small unidentified baitfish were abundant. The highest densities of commercial species occurred between 25 and 75 m depth, suggesting that mid-depth platform sections had high habitat value, a consideration when selecting decommissioning options. The greatest difficulties using the video were the poor lighting and resolution that inhibited our ability to identify sessile species with high taxonomic precision. However, the footage was useful for evaluating high-level biodiversity of the platform, understanding how fish and invertebrate communities changed with depth and comprehending the dynamic nature of the invertebrate community over time. Understanding the habitat value of structures will be necessary for making environmentally sound decommissioning decisions in the future.",,,,,,,,,14,0,0,0,8,0,14,,,,2296-7745,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Western Australia, Oceans Grad Sch, Perth, WA, AustraliaUniv Western Australia, UWA Oceans Inst, Perth, WA, AustraliaUniv Technol Sydney, Sch Life Sci, Ecosyst Secur Team, Ultimo, NSW, AustraliaDeakin Univ, Sch Life & Environm Sci, Burwood, VIC, AustraliaUniv Wollongong, Ctr Sustainable Ecosyst Solut, Fac Sci Med & Hlth, Wollongong, NSW, AustraliaUniv Wollongong, Sch Biol Sci, Fac Sci Med & Hlth, Wollongong, NSW, Australia",,,,2019-02-13,WOS:000457219500001,,

This study applied a collision model for safety assessment. It also involved a spatiotemporal analysis of vessels engaged in fishing to identify fishing hotspots around the offshore wind farm. This study used data from fishing vessel location transmission devices gathered over 1 year in 2014. As a result, in September, when the average number of vessels engaged in fishing is high, 62 ships were operating in fishing section 184-6 and 55 ships in section 184-6. In addition, in fishing sections 184-8 and 192-2, where an offshore wind farm was located, there were 55 and 38 ships operating, respectively. As the recovery period for a seaway near wind farm turbines is 55 years, it was determined that safety measures are required in order to reduce collision frequency while allowing fishing vessels to navigate through offshore wind farms. Meanwhile, the return period of Seaway B between the groups of generators considered was 184 years. A safety zone for offshore wind farms should be installed covering a distance of at least 0.3 NM from the boundary of turbines. Then, the collision return period was derived to be close to 100 years. Through this traffic safety assessment, it has been concluded that such measures would help prevent marine accidents.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,1229-3431,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2017-01-01,KJD:ART002229314,,

Being attracted to hard substrates, fish schools usually aggregate around the jackets or legs of the platforms where they are afforded some protection from predators and benefit from high concentrations of prey and smaller organisms foraging in the area. However, even though higher fish densities are reported near the structures, behavior and movements of fish schools around the platforms have not yet been properly investigated.In such context, this chapter investigates the diurnal spatial movements of schooling fish around three gas extraction platforms placed in the north-central Adriatic Sea to improve knowledge on how these structures influence the surrounding fish assemblage.Hydroacoustic multibeam echosounder surveys were conducted for 1 year at dawn, noon, and dusk. Results highlighted the variation in fish biomass around the platforms related to the time of the day and distance from the structure. Recognizing a constant attraction of fish to the platforms during daylight hours (i.e., dawn to dusk), fish biomass was greater near the gas platforms, especially at dusk. Oppositely, variation in the morphometric features of fish schools occurred during the daytime only for the school volume associated with platforms at deeper depths. Complementary information on the fish assemblages associated with the gas platforms derived from fishing surveys allowed a better understanding of the diurnal behavior of fish schools around the structures.",,,,,Symposium on Marine Artificial Reef Research and Development: Integrating Fisheries Management ObjectivesSymposium on Marine Artificial Reef Research and Development: Integrating Fisheries Management Objectives,"AUG 22-23, 2017AUG 22-23, 2017",,"Tampa, FLTampa, FL",1,0,0,0,0,0,1,,,0892-2284,,978-1-934874-51-6,,,,,,,,,"CNR, Inst Marine Sci, Largo Fiera Pesca 1, I-60125 Ancona, Italy",,,,2019-02-13,WOS:000456750700002,,

Although offshore wind farms have been developed in Europe and Asia, the Block Island Wind Farm (BIWF) is the first offshore wind farm built in North America. To improve marine resource management, it is critical to understand the impacts of the wind farm on marine resource users in context. Little is known about the impacts of offshore wind farms on marine resource users in the United States. This study investigates recreational and commercial fishers' perceptions of the impacts of the BIWF on the local marine ecosystem. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 25 fishers, mostly based out of Block Island or Point Judith, Rhode Island (US), in the summer and fall of 2017. During the interviews, fishers were asked about their perceptions of changes in the marine ecology of the wind farm area during and after the offshore wind turbines were constructed, and how their activities in the area have changed since the wind farm was installed. Results indicate that there were perceived impacts of the BIWF on the local ecosystem and the behavior of the marine resource users. For some recreational fishers, the wind farm functioned as a destination or target and served as an artificial reef for spearfishing. For some commercial fishers, the increase in recreational fishing due to the establishment of the BIWF crowded out commercial fishers in these areas. As the offshore wind farm industry expands within US waters, findings from this study and others like it can provide valuable insights on the potential impacts of these wind farms on marine resource users.

The ichthyoplankton and juvenile fish assemblages were sampled at Green Canyon 18 (219-m depth, shelf slope), Grand Isle 94 (60-m depth, mid-shelf), and South Timbalier 54 (22-m depth, inner shelf) with passive plankton nets and light traps. At all sites, clupeiforms were the dominant taxa collected, comprising 59-97% of the total catch. Reef-dependent Fishes (e.g., pomacentrids and scarids) were relatively rare at all Platforms, while reef-associated taxa (e.g., serranids, carangids, and blenniids) were generally more common. High numbers of piscivorous juveniles (synodontids, scombrids, and carangids) were collected, indicating that predation during early life history stages may be important in determining local reef assemblages. Similarity indices indicated that the larval and juvenile fish assemblages collected at the platforms differed across the shelf. Overall, across-shelf patterns in reef fish larval and juvenile fish distributions were similar to those of the adults. Taxonomic richness (genus level) was highest at the mid-shelf platform, possibly a result of its proximity to a high density of upstream and surrounding platforms, which may create generally favorable conditions for the recruitment of reef fishes. There were no significant differences in taxonomic diversity among the platforms in plankton net collections, but light trap diversity was significantly highest at the mid-shelf platform. With the limited amount of hard-substrate habitat available in the northern Gulf, the addition of artificial habitats (platforms) may increase the chances of adult fishes finding suitable spawning habitat, as well as increase the number of settlement sites for juvenile fishes, particularly where platforms are most dense (mid- and inner shelf).",,,,,Gulf of Mexico Fish and Fisheries MeetingGulf of Mexico Fish and Fisheries Meeting,"OCT 24-26, 2000OCT 24-26, 2000",Minerals Management ServMinerals Management Serv,"NEW ORLEANS, LANEW ORLEANS, LA",22,0,0,0,20,1,29,,,0892-2284,,1-888569-54-9,,,,,,,,,"NOAA, Beaufort Lab, Beaufort, NC 28516 USA",,,,2003-01-01,WOS:000185466300003,,

In parallel, there is a need to better understand the effects of these installations on coastal marine ecosystems and identify potential sea use conflicts, especially when the area is subject to access restrictions. This study investigated the effects of a spatial closure during the exploitation phase of an offshore wind farm in the extended Bay of Seine (English Channel, France) using Ecospace, a spatially and temporally explicit module of Ecopath with Ecosim. To address this question, simulations were conducted through the evaluation of what-if scenarios to assess the effectiveness of a fishing exclusion zone inside and surrounding the offshore wind farm. Several biomass, catch and trophic level-based indicators were calculated to evaluate how the exclusion zone could affect fishing activities and main components of the food web. All the indicators were estimated in the extended Bay of Seine and summarized by subarea. Findings suggested that the spillover effect could mitigate the negative impact of access loss on fishing activities, in a scenario of simulated closure of the area of the wind farm. The Ecospace model predicted an increase of catches (up to 7% near the wind farm) and a slight increase in the proportion of high trophic level species. However, the influence of spillover effects is limited in space and the expected increase of biomass and catches are highly localized in areas around the offshore wind farm installations. At the scale of the Bay of Seine, further analysis of the spillover effects revealed a spatial pattern and suggested that the implementation of an exclusion zone inside the offshore wind farm could concentrate highly mobile predators.",,,,,,,,,24,1,0,0,15,0,26,,,0924-7963,1879-1573,,,,,,,,,,"IFREMER, Unite Halieut Manche Mer Nord Ifremer, HMMN, F-62200 Boulogne Sur Mer, FranceNormandie Univ, UniCaen, CNRS,MNHN,IRD,SU,UA, EcoFunc,Lab Borea Biol Organismes & Ecosystemos A, CS 14032, F-14000 Caen, FranceMarine & Freshwater Res Ctr MFRC, Galway Mayo Inst Technol GMIT, Dublin Rd, Galway, IrelandIFREMER, Unite Ecol & Modeles & Halieut Ifremer, EMH, F-29280 Ploussane, FranceNormandie Univ UNICAEN, UMR M2C, UCN, UR,CNRS 6143, 24 Rue Tilleuls, F-14000 Caen, FranceUniv Littoral Cote dOpale, Univ Lille, CNRS, UMR 8187,Lab Oceanol & Geosci, F-62930 Wimereux, FranceIFREMER, Unite Halieut Manche Mer Nord Ifremer, HMMN, F-14520 Port En Bessin, FranceUniv Brest, Inst Rech Dev, CNRS, IFREMER,LEMAR, F-29280 Ploussane, FranceFrance Energies Marines ITE EMR, 525 Ave Alexis de Rochon, F-29280 Plouzane, France",Marine & Freshwater Res Ctr MFRCFrance Energies Marines ITE EMR,,,2020-11-11,WOS:000582806700013,,

Thousands of fixed platforms and associated equipment have been installed on the Gulf of Mexico continental shelf, leading to a pervasive 'ocean sprawl.' After decommissioning, 100s of these structures have been converted to artificial reefs under the federal 'Rigs-to-Reefs' program, in addition to artificial reefs specifically designed to enhance fisheries and/or benefit the recreational diving industry. Apart from a few natural banks, which reach to approximately 55 ft below the surface, artificial reefs provide the only shallow-water hard substrate for benthic organisms in the deeper waters of the northern Gulf of Mexico. This vast expansion in available habitat has almost exclusively occurred over a relatively short span of time (similar to 50 years). The ecological interactions of artificial and natural reefs in the northern Gulf of Mexico are complex. Artificial reefs in general, and oil and gas structures in particular, have often been invoked as stepping stones for non-native and invasive species (e.g., Tubastrea cup corals, lionfish). The pilings are covered with fouling communities which remain largely unstudied. While the risks of these fouling organisms for invading natural reefs are being broadly discussed, other impacts on the ecological and economic health of the Gulf of Mexico, such as the potential to facilitate jellyfish blooms or increase the incidence of ciguatera fish poisoning, have received less attention. Artificial reefs also provide ecosystem services, particularly as habitat for economically important fish species like red snapper. Here we revisit the potential role of artificial reefs as 'stepping stones' for species invasions and for fisheries enhancement. Beyond concerns about ecological effects, some of these topics also raise public health concerns. We point out gaps in current knowledge and propose future research directions.",,,,,,,,,17,0,0,0,11,0,17,,,,2296-7745,,,,,,,,,,"Texas A&M Univ, Dept Marine Biol, Galveston Campus, Galveston, TX 77553 USAUniv Texas Austin, Marine Sci Inst, Port Aransas, TX USALouisiana State Univ, Dept Oceanog & Coastal Studies, Baton Rouge, LA 70803 USA",,,,2020-06-12,WOS:000539975400001,,

Commercially important gadoids such as saithe Pollachius virens, haddock Melanogrammus aeglefinus and cod Gadus morhua were the most abundant species, however, the species composition and the relative abundances of the species varied with depth, season and between years. Comparisons with a large-scale bottom trawl survey data suggested highly dynamic and species-specific interactions between fish movements, changing environmental conditions and the physical presence of an offshore platform. Given the number of platforms currently installed across the North Sea, there is a need to identify biological mechanisms behind such dynamic interactions. (C) 2015 The Author.

The same region is also the current hotspot for offshore wind power development. Wind farms can have negative environmental impacts during construction, but during the operational phase many organisms are attracted to the foundations and thereby may also find refuge from fisheries. Given the recent implementation of marine spatial planning in Europe and elsewhere, this is a critical time to address potential compatibility and synergies between marine conservation and wind power. This review concludes that offshore wind farms can be at least as effective as existing marine protected areas in terms of creating refuges for benthic habitats, benthos, fish and marine mammals. The degree of advantage for these organisms depends on the location of the wind farm and the level of imposed fishing restriction. Under certain conditions wind farms may even be more efficient means of conservation than ordinary marine protected areas. However, offshore wind farms can be negative for several species of seabirds, essentially as occupying preferred feeding or wintering grounds. In areas important to these seabirds wind farms may not comply with conservation. The results bring important messages to marine spatial planning as some but not all wind farms can be spatially combined with, and even synergistic to, marine conservation.",,,,,,,,,28,1,0,0,12,0,31,,,2161-7384; 2161-7392,,,,,,,,,,,"Chalmers Univ Technol, Dept Energy & Environm, Gothenburg, S-41296, Sweden",,,,2016-10-13,ZOOREC:ZOOR15209054182,,

Given the pressures to develop offshore wind farms, there is an urgent need to assess population-level impacts on protected marine birds. Here we refine an approach to assess aspects of their ecology that influence population vulnerability to wind farm impacts, also taking into account the conservation importance of each species. Flight height appears to be a key factor influencing collision mortality risk but improved data on flight heights of marine birds are needed. Collision index calculations identify populations of gulls, white-tailed eagles, northern gannets and skuas as of particularly high concern in Scottish waters. Displacement index calculations identify populations of divers and common scoters as most vulnerable to population-level impacts of displacement, but these are likely to be less evident than impacts of collision mortality. The collision and displacement indices developed here for Scottish marine bird populations could be applied to populations elsewhere, and this approach will help in identifying likely impacts of future offshore wind farms on marine birds and prioritising monitoring programmes, at least until data on macro-avoidance rates become available.

Today, over 3,837 offshore oil and gas platforms have been installed, producing 25% of the U.S.A.'s natural gas and approximately 13% of its oil. In addition to meeting the world's energy needs, these structures also form one of the world's most extensive de facto artificial reef systems. However, federal regulations require that these structures be removed within 1 yr after the mineral lease is terminated. Disposal of obsolete offshore oil and gas structures is not only a financial liability for private industry, but can also result in a loss of productive marine habitat. In 1986, the Louisiana Fishing Enhancement Act was signed into law in response to the National Fishing Enhancement Act, creating the Louisiana Artificial Reef Program. This program was designed to take advantage of fishing habitat opportunities offered by these obsolete platforms. Since the program's inception, 25 reef sites have been created off Louisiana's coast using the components (jackets and decks) of 71 obsolete platforms. The use of obsolete oil and gas platforms in Louisiana has proved to be highly successful. Their quantity, design, longevity, and stability have provided a number of advantages over the use of traditional artificial reef materials. Participating companies also save money by converting structures into reefs rather than abandoning them onshore. They then are required to donate a portion of the savings to the state to run the artificial reef program. One disadvantage, however, is that the large size of these platforms restricts the distance from shore where they can be placed. To achieve the minimum clearance of 16 m over a submerged structure, as required by the New Orleans (8th) Coast Guard District regulations, the platforms must be placed in waters deeper than 30 m. Waters of this depth are found between 22 km and 115 km from shore on Louisiana's gently sloping continental shelf, making them almost inaccessible to many anglers. Funds generated by the program, however, can be used to develop reefs to closer to shore if alternative low-profile materials are used. Due to the high maintenance costs of both the structure and aids to navigation, the increased liability exposure, and the undetermined cost of removing the structure once it becomes a hazard to public safety and navigation, leaving the structures standing in place has thus far proved not to be a viable option in Louisiana.",,,,,,,,,11,0,0,0,4,0,16,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1998-06-01,BCI:BCI199900213019,,

The growth of offshore wind farms has raised concerns about their impact on the marine environment. Marine mammals use sound for foraging, orientation and communication and are therefore possibly susceptible to negative effects of man-made noise generated from constructing and operating large offshore wind turbines. This paper reviews the existing literature and assesses zones of impact from different noise-generating activities in conjunction with wind farms on 4 representative shallow-water species of marine mammals. Construction involves many types of activities that can generate high sound pressure levels, and pile-driving seems to be the noisiest of all. Both the literature and modeling show that pile-driving and other activities that generate intense impulses during construction are likely to disrupt the behavior of marine mammals at ranges of many kilometers, and that these activities have the potential to induce hearing impairment at close range. The reported noise levels from operating wind turbines are low, and are unlikely to impair hearing in marine mammals. The impact zones for marine mammals from operating wind turbines depend on the low-frequency hearing-abilities of the species in question, on sound-propagation conditions, and on the presence of other noise sources such as shipping. The noise impact on marine mammals is more severe during the construction of wind farms than during their operation.",,,,,,,,,245,4,0,0,160,0,260,,,0171-8630,1616-1599,,,,,,,,,,"Woods Hole Oceanog Inst, Dept Biol, Woods Hole, MA 02543 USAAarhus Univ, Inst Biol, Dept Zoophysiol, DK-8000 Aarhus C, DenmarkNatl Environm Res Inst, Dept Arctic Environm, DK-4000 Roskilde, DenmarkUniv Kiel, Sci & Res Ctr, D-25761 Busum, Germany",,,,2006-01-01,WOS:000237020200023,,

This study analyzed bacterial communities and metals in the produced water, surrounding seawater, and sediment around the Thebaud platform. The bacterial community within the produced water was different from the seawater (SAB = 13.3), but the discharge had no detectable effect on the bacterial communities in the seawater (SAB > 97). In contrast, genomic analysis of sediments revealed that the bacterial community from 250 m was different (SAB = 70) from other locations further from the discharge, suggesting that the produced water had a detectable effect on the bacterial community in the sediment closest to the discharge. These near-field sediments contained elevated concentrations of manganese and iron that are associated with the produced water effluent. The results suggested that the discharge of produced water has influenced the bacterial community structure of sediments adjacent to the platform. Crown Copyright (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

These '' rig-to-reef '' projects have been promoted as innovative public-private partnerships that address the dual problems of costly platform removal and disappearing fishing opportunities. I argue that the current legal framework fails to ensure habitat enhancement and may condone ocean dumping. The problem can be traced to three sources: federal and state competition on the outer continental shelf, lack of a comprehensive long-term federal vision for outer continental shelf development, and interest group pressure in the face of scientific uncertainty.

Laws require that a platform at the end of its production life be totally removed unless the submerged jacket section continues as a reef under state sponsorship. Consideration of the eventual fate of the populations of fishes and invertebrates beneath platforms has led to global reefing of the jacket portion of platforms instead of removal at the time of decommissioning. The construction and use of artificial reefs are centuries old and global in nature using a great variety of materials. The history that led to the reefing option for platforms begins in the mid-20th century in an effort for general artificial reefs to provide both fishing opportunities and increase fisheries production for a burgeoning U.S. population. The trend toward reefing platforms at end of their lives followed after the oil and gas industry installed thousands of standing platforms in the Gulf of Mexico where they had become popular fishing destinations. The National Fishing Enhancement Act and subsequent National Artificial Reef Plan laid the foundation for Rig-to-Reefs. Reefing platforms in the Gulf of Mexico is a well-established practice that is also applied globally. Deliberation of reefing decommissioned platforms and many years of scientific study beneath California platforms has culminated in a California State law that now allows consideration of the concept. This paper summarizes the history, practices, published science, and available information involved when considering the reefing option.

Environmental conditions are most dynamic on the Louisiana shelf, a region in which oil and gas platforms (hereafter platforms) are abundant and serve as artificial reefs. Platforms provide a unique, vertically oriented substrate for fouling organisms and nekton throughout the water column and often span substantial gradients of salinity, temperature, dissolved oxygen (DO), and water clarity. During the summers of 2013 and 2014, we used paired video and hydrographic samples taken at 150 small platforms sited in nearshore waters (3.7-18.0 m water depth) to document the responses of platform-associated fishes to coastal water quality. Responses of the 26 analyzed fish species included substantial changes in habitat selection coupled with vertical habitat compression. The vertical extent of the water column suitable for fishes was compressed due to avoidance of hypoxic bottom water (DO <50% saturation) and apparent avoidance of eutrophic surface strata with supersaturated oxygen conditions (140.7 +/- 7.0% saturation [95% CI]). Generalized linear mixed models, habitat suitability indices, and factor analysis suggested that fish habitat-selection patterns varied significantly in the presence of hypoxia by up to 10 salinity units, 10 degrees C, 30% DO saturation, 6 m water depth, and 4.5 m Secchi depth.

Strained by current low prices of crude oil, cost rationalization is essential for economic viability of oil and gas exploration offshore. Offshore exploration involves costly activities such as well drilling, well completion and testing as well as installation of flow lines and subsea facilities. Well drilling generates drill cuttings which may be disposed either onshore or offshore. Onshore disposal is not cost-effective and operationally complicated, and should be the option of last resort. More cost-effective offshore disposal of drill cuttings should therefore be utilized if it can be proven to be environmentally sustainable to the marine environment and ecosystems. This research was initiated to assess the environmental sustainability of offshore disposal of drill cuttings by means of model simulations. A critical concern in drill cuttings offshore disposal is the suspended solids (SS) created that might pose adverse impact to marine ecosystems. This paper presents the results of a simulation study by means of AQUASEA, developed by Vatnaskil Consulting Engineers, on the transport and fact of SS at an offshore oil and gas exploration platform in Siakap North Petai Field, off Sabah in the South China Sea. Simulated SS plumes subject to the dominant semi-diurnal tidal flows in the South China Sea and local eddies will be presented. Simulation results indicate that this offshore disposal of drill cuttings is environmentally sustainable at the current rates of well drilling. (C) 2017 The Authors.

Mobile acoustic surveys were used to assess both horizontal and vertical distribution and abundance of fishes associated with the shallow water (16 m depth) reef complex and adjacent soft-bottom habitats extending 1 km from the reef complex. Highest acoustic estimates of fish biomass and density were found directly over the reef with a five-fold and 16-fold decrease at 10 and 30 m distances from the structure, respectively.

As platforms reach the end of their useful lifetime, operators and regulatory agencies will assess the environmental impact of potential decommissioning strategies. Among the many factors that will be weighed in preparation for these major economic and engineering challenges is the fate of the fish and invertebrate communities that inhabit the structures underwater. Offshore platforms act as inadvertent artificial reefs, and some are recognized among the most productive fish habitats in the global oceans. We present a model for forecasting changes to fish communities surrounding offshore installations following a series of decommissioning alternatives. Using 24 platforms off southern California, we estimate fish biomass and somatic production under three possible decommissioning scenarios: leave in place, partial removal at 26-m depth, and complete removal of the platform and underlying shell mound. We used fish density and size data from scuba and submersible surveys of the platforms from 1995-2013 to estimate biomass and annual somatic production. Bottom trawl surveys were used to characterize future fish assemblages at platform sites under the complete-removal decommissioning scenario. Based on a conservatively modeled extrapolation of the survey data, we found that complete removal of a platform resulted in 95% or more reduction in the average fish biomass and annual somatic production at the site, while partial removal resulted in far smaller losses, averaging 10% or less. In the event that all surveyed platforms are completely removed, we estimated a total loss of more than 28,000 kg of fish biomass in the Southern California Bight. Platform habitats, which attract reef-dwelling fish species, had minimal overlap in community composition with the surrounding soft-bottom habitat. To best serve the wide range of stakeholder interests, the site-specific biomass, productivity and species composition information provided in this study should be incorporated into strategic decommissioning planning.

We do so by focusing on regime shifts and cross-scale effects, described through the concepts of adaptive cycles and ecosystem services. Offshore wind farming is shown to lead to a potential slow regime shift in the marine ecosystem, as well as a more rapid regime shift in the seascape. These shifts lead to changes in the available ecosystem services and conflicts between new and traditional sea and seascape values. We then explore the impact of these changes on the socioeconomic system on the coast.

The results revealed frequent increases in abundances of species associated with hard substrata after the establishment of artificial structures (i.e., both OWFs and ARs) in the marine environment.

The submerged parts of their structures act as artificial reefs, providing new habitats and likely affecting fisheries resources. While acknowledging that the footprints of these structures may result in loss of habitat, usually soft sediment, we focus on how the artificial reefs established by OWFs affect ecosystem structure and functioning. Structurally, the ecological response begins with high diversity and biomass in the flora and fauna that gradually colonize the complex hard substrate habitat. The species may include nonindigenous ones that are extending their spatial distributions and/or strengthening populations, locally rare species (e.g., hard substrate-associated fish), and habitat-forming species that further increase habitat complexity. Functionally, the response begins with dominant suspension feeders that filter organic matter from the water column. Their fecal deposits alter the surrounding seafloor communities by locally increasing food availability, and higher trophic levels (fish, birds, marine mammals) also profit from locally increased food availability and/or shelter. The structural and functional effects extend in space and time, impacting species differently throughout their life cycles.

We compared the coral communities on standing offshore oil/gas production platforms with those on Rigs-to-Reef structures through Remotely Operated Vehicle reconnaissance (max. depth similar to 110 m) to assess comparative population sizes of several coral species. Corals found were the zooxanthellate Madracis decactis and azooxanthellate Tubastraea coccinea, Oculina diffusa, and Phyllangia americana. There was no significant difference in total coral density between standing and toppled platforms, due to varying species-specific abundances. Madracis decactis and T. coccinea densities were significantly higher on toppled structures than on standing ones, P. americana was more abundant on standing platforms, and O. diffusa densities were not significantly different between the two sets of platforms. Corals were distributed more deeply on standing platforms than on toppled ones (particularly O. diffusa and P. americana). Madracis decactis (requiring light) and T. coccinea were concentrated at shallower depths (<= 50 m). Rigs-to-Reefs structures serve as substrate for coral settlement.

Negative effects include bird collisions, underwater sounds and electromagnetic fields, whilst positive effects constitute functioning as artificial reef and acting as no-take zones for fish, with possible spill-over effects.This paper presents a spatially explicit framework to analyze effects of wind farms on the marine environment and aims to evaluate how wind farms can contribute to protection of the marine environment through strategic and economically viable location choices.The functioning and the applicability of the model are demonstrated in a numerical example for the Dutch exclusive economic zone. We find that the careful spatial planning of wind farms is a key factor for profitability and environmental protection, and that, if carefully planned, the environment can benefit from offshore wind farms.

Through a close empirical historical study, this article reconstructs how Greenpeace's protest of the deep-water disposal of the Brent Spar spurred the exclusion of rigs-to-reefs (the conversion of obsolete offshore oil and gas structures into artificial reefs) as a viable decommissioning option by the primary international treaty organization with jurisdiction over North Sea waters, the Oslo-Paris Commission (OSPAR). During OSPAR's artificial reef guideline development, several OSPAR contracting parties implied that there is a conspiracy among oil companies to use rigs-to-reefs as a cover for evading the deep-water disposal rules, although they never presented evidence to back up these claims. In the face of pressure to close the loophole for deep-water disposal and in spite of scientific objection. OSPAR's final guidelines excluded all non-virgin materials as acceptable reef construction materials, essentially banning rigs-to-reefs. Because a significant number of steel offshore installations will be decommissioned in North Sea waters in the decade and the most up-to-date science has concluded that manmade deep-water reefs may be beneficial to some species including threatened cold-water coral, this article suggests that OSPAR revise its guidelines. Rigs-to-reefs should be not categorically excluded; a case-by-case determination of the suitability of a structure for reuse as an artificial reef would be most appropriate. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Therefore, many countries have already owned the offshore wind farms or planned to develop in recent years. Taiwan is going to build the demonstration project including offshore wind turbines and meteorological masts in the western sea of Taiwan. Before installation of wind turbines, site selection and condition survey are request. However, monitoring of wind turbines and ambient environments are also needed to collect data for the operation and the maintenance in the offshore wind farms. We know that Taiwan is a high-risk area with frequent natural disasters, such as typhoons, earthquakes, and monsoon. While the foundation and infrastructure of wind farms are designed and manufactured by higher safety factors to reduce the damage, the environmental impact might increase as well. Generally, the meteorological masts are the main part of environmental monitoring in the offshore wind farms. According to the demonstration project of offshore wind farms in Taiwan, the meteorological masts need some instruments for ocean environmental observations, which are tidal levels, sea surface waves, sea currents, seawater temperatures, salinities, and densities. Most of specifications in those instruments are followed by the IEC International Standard 61400-12-1. Moreover, the demonstration project requests the developers, who are in charge of the meteorological masts have to provide a long term data of 5 years at least. Because those instruments need retrieved and calibrated every 6-12 months. For lower capital expense, we design a seabed-mounted junction box to connect all underwater instruments and reserved an extensive capability for a monitoring network in the future. Moreover, we also integrate more underwater instruments, such as hydrophone for underwater noise measurement and seismometer. Although most of the planned wind farms in Taiwan have avoided away the habitats of the Chinese White Dolphins (Sousa chinensis), the noise impacts are still concerned. Thus, the underwater noises include the piling noise, the shipping noises, the cable laying noises, and the wind turbine operation noises, all of which are highly emphasized in the strategy for environmental impact assessments and monitoring plans. The power supply for those instruments is designed to depend on the rechargeable batteries at the meteorological masts, so those subsystems are designed using low power consumptions. A fiber-optic cable is used for the power and data transmission between the junction box and the meteorological mast. All collected data would be preliminarily processed in the meteorological mast and then transmit via the wireless transmission system to the land station for the owners and end-users. In addition, an offsite back of archive data is planned as well.",,,,,MTS/IEEE OCEANS ConferenceMTS/IEEE OCEANS Conference,"JUN 10-14, 2013JUN 10-14, 2013","Marine Technol Soc; IEEE; IEEE Ocean Engn Soc; SFE Power; Marintek; Norwegian Def Res Estab; Inst Marine Res; Univ Bergen, Geophys Inst; Gersemia, Bekkadal Consultancy & Engn Serv; NERSCMarine Technol Soc; IEEE; IEEE Ocean Engn Soc; SFE Power; Marintek; Norwegian Def Res Estab; Inst Marine Res; Univ Bergen, Geophys Inst; Gersemia, Bekkadal Consultancy & Engn Serv; NERSC","Bergen, NORWAYBergen, NORWAY",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,0197-7385,,978-1-4799-0000-8; 978-1-4799-0002-2,,,,,,,,,"Ship & Ocean Ind R&D Ctr, Ocean Ind Div, New Taipei City, Taiwan",Ship & Ocean Ind R&D Ctr,,,2014-06-11,WOS:000335313100152,,

We compared local populations of viviparous eelpout in the Lillgrund Offshore Wind Farm (OWF) with natural sites in the Oresund strait in Sweden. Eelpout studies on population dynamics, biometrics, reproductive success and fry development were conducted in 2011 and 2012.

Our findings showed that Lillgrund OWF neither had an impact on the condition index (CI), nor on brood development of female viviparous eelpout. Furthermore, populations size estimates in Lillgrund indicated that eelpout neither specifically aggregated in nor avoided the offshore wind farm, and no clear reef effect attracting eelpout to the foundations and scour protections of the OWF was observed. Our conclusion is that the operating wind farm did not have any potentially negative effects, since we did not observe any negative effects neither on the individual health of eelpout nor of the reproductive performance. We suggest that eelpout which may also be used as an indicator species for the environmental status of Lillgrund, as well as for other offshore wind farms and marine renewable energy installations, both in the Baltic and coastal waters in northern Europe.",,,,,,,,,7,2,0,0,4,0,9,,,1470-160X,1872-7034,,,,,,,,,,"Chalmers Univ Technol, Dept Energy & Environm, Gothenburg, SwedenNorwegian Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Biol, Ctr Biodivers Dynam, Trondheim, NorwayGothenburg Univ, Dept Marine Sci, Gothenburg, SwedenUni Res, Bergen, Norway",Uni Res,,,2018-03-13,WOS:000425828200001,,

The vast majority of wind power is generated from onshore wind farms. Their growth is however limited by the lack of inexpensive land near major population centers and the visual pollution caused by large wind turbines.Wind energy generated from offshore wind farms is the next frontier. Large sea areas with stronger and steadier winds are available for wind farm development and 5MW wind turbine towers located 20 miles from the coastline are invisible. Current offshore wind turbines are supported by monopoles driven into the seafloor at coastal sites a few miles from shore and in water depths of 10-15m. The primary impediment to their growth is visual pollution and the prohibitive cost of seafloor mounted monopoles in larger water depths.This paper presents a fully coupled dynamic analysis of floating wind turbines that enables a parametric design study of floating wind turbine concepts and mooring systems. Pareto optimal designs are presented that possess a favorable combination of nacelle acceleration, mooring system tension and displacement of the floating structure supporting a five megawatt wind turbine. All concepts are selected so that they float stably while in tow to the offshore wind farm site and prior to their connection to the mooring system. A fully coupled dynamic analysis is carried out of the wind turbine, floater and mooring system in wind and a sea state based on standard computer programs used by the offshore and wind industries. The results of the parametric study are designs that show Pareto fronts for mean square acceleration of the turbine versus key cost drivers for the offshore structure that include the weight of the floating structure and the static plus dynamic mooring line tension.Pareto optimal structures are generally either a narrow deep drafted spar, or a shallow drafted barge ballasted with concrete.The mooring systems include both tension leg and catenary mooring systems. In some of the designs, the RMS acceleration of the wind turbine nacelle can be as low as 0.03 g in a sea state with a significant wave height of ten meters and water depths of up to 200 meters. These structures meet design requirements while possessing a favorable combination of nacelle acceleration, total mooring system tension and weight of the floating structure.

We review post-construction studies of seabirds at 20 OWFs in European waters to extract and classify evidence for displacement or attraction of 33 different seabird species. Divers and northern gannets showed consistent and strong avoidance behaviour/displacement, and this may also be the case for great crested grebe and northern fulmar. Long-tailed duck, common scoter, Manx shearwater, razorbill, common guillemot, little gull and sandwich tern showed less consistent displacement from OWFs. Several gull species and red-breasted merganser showed weak attraction, while great cormorant and European shag showed strong attraction to OWFs. Other species show little response. Displacement seems mainly to be due to bird responses to OWF structures and appears stronger when turbines are rotating, but could in part be due to boat traffic to and from OWFs. Attraction of cormorants relates at least impart to their use of structures for roosting and for drying plumage, but increases in food availability at OWFs appears to be an important influence for several species.

The job will require help from the government, electric operator and manufacturers. The domestic offshore wind farm market will boost global competitiveness up until 2019.This research analyzes the economic impact of the offshore wind farm project. The local acceptance in terms of production, employment and value added are expected to be maximized. According to the quantitative analysis using the extended 2010 input-output table, we calculated that the production inducement impact will reach up to 13.5 trillion won. 11.07 trillion won from the offshore wind farm industry and 2.4 trillion won from others. Furthermore the impact of increase in employment is expected to reach 22,662. 9,883 will be from the wind farm industry and 12,779 from other fields. The impact is expected to be greater especially during the middle of the jobless growth period, Lastly, the value added inducement impact is expected to be 4.24 trillion won.Regarding economic impacts, strategies required for increasing local acceptance are as follows. First, in order to diversify and sophisticate the primary industry into a secondary or tertiary one, we need to develop the nearby wind farm site into a wind farm thema park. Attracting the wind farm production, installing and maintaining/repairing firms and establishing an experience center for K-12 students by providing them an education center for offshore wind energy can be specific means of development. Also, during the operation and after the destruction of facilities, the government should lay out the sub-structure of the wind farm as a sea ranch. Thirdly, the level of local acceptance regarding the community ownership of the offshore wind farm should increase to those of Middelgrunden(Denmark) and Navarra(Spain). Considering the economic condition of Buan, Gochang and the Yeonggwang area, community ownership is one of best solutions for the increment of local tax revenue. At last, considering the supports system of areas adjacent to power plants and 'Partnership management with local community’, the offshore wind farm operator may need to provide assistant policies to nearby communities. The policies should be based on Corporate Social Responsibility(CSR) such as education scholarship projects, local economy cooperative projects, sports/culture projects.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,1738-1592,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2014-01-01,KJD:ART001923265,,

Understanding wakes of wind farms, which is the region of momentum and energy deficit downwind, is important for optimising the wind farm layouts and operation to minimize costs. While in most weather situations (unstable atmospheric stratification), the wakes of wind turbines are only a local effect within the wind farm, satellite imagery reveals wind-farm wakes to be several tens of kilometres in length under certain conditions (stable atmospheric stratification), which is also predicted by numerical models. The first direct in situ measurements of the existence and shape of large wind farm wakes by a specially equipped research aircraft in 2016 and 2017 confirm wake lengths of more than tens of kilometres under stable atmospheric conditions, with maximum wind speed deficits of 40%, and enhanced turbulence.

In the Netherlands, an extensive monitoring programme is being executed at the first offshore wind farm (Offshore Windfarm Egmond aan Zee, OWEZ). This letter compiles the short-term (two years) results on a large number of faunal groups obtained so far. Impacts were expected from the new hard substratum, the moving rotor blades, possible underwater noise and the exclusion of fisheries. The results indicate no short-term effects on the benthos in the sandy area between the generators, while the new hard substratum of the monopiles and the scouring protection led to the establishment of new species and new fauna communities. Bivalve recruitment was not impacted by the OWEZ wind farm. Species composition of recruits in OWEZ and the surrounding reference areas is correlated with mud content of the sediment and water depth irrespective the presence of OWEZ. Recruit abundances in OWEZ were correlated with mud content, most likely to be attributed not to the presence of the farm but to the absence of fisheries. The fish community was highly dynamic both in time and space. So far, only minor effects upon fish assemblages especially near the monopiles have been observed. Some fish species, such as cod, seem to find shelter inside the farm. More porpoise clicks were recorded inside the farm than in the reference areas outside the farm. Several bird species seem to avoid the park while others are indifferent or are even attracted. The effects of the wind farm on a highly variable ecosystem are described. Overall, the OWEZ wind farm acts as a new type of habitat with a higher biodiversity of benthic organisms, a possibly increased use of the area by the benthos, fish, marine mammals and some bird species and a decreased use by several other bird species.",,,,,,,,,162,3,0,0,95,0,180,,,1748-9326,,,,,,,,,,,"IMARES, NL-1790 AD Den Burg, NetherlandsNoordzeeWind, NL-1976 CE Ijmuiden, NetherlandsRoyal NIOZ, NL-1790 AB Den Burg, NetherlandsBur Waardenburg, NL-4100 AJ Culemborg, NetherlandsIMARES, NL-1970 AB Ijmuiden, Netherlands",NoordzeeWindBur Waardenburg,,,2011-07-01,WOS:000295327900041,,

To analyze the economic feasibility of offshore wind farms, harvestable energy was calculated using an InVEST (Integrated Valuation of Environmental Services and Tradeoffs) model that has been used widely for marine ecosystem service analysis. Capital costs for grid connection and electricity transmission, operation and maintenance costs, and other costs were integrated together to calculate a net present value (NPV) of a 60-MW offshore wind farm assuming a lifetime of 20 years of operation. It is important to note that NPVs of offshore wind farms are affected significantly by the proximity to the closest inland substations, showing the importance of grid connection. Criteria that may cause social and environmental conflicts were grouped into three categories: nature conservation and landscape protection, marine-based human activities, and marine environment and marine ecosystem. Available datasets for each category were compiled and incorporated into GIS-based maps. Many social and environmental criteria overlapped spatially, and areas influenced by one or more criteria were designated as areas of potential conflicts. Economic analysis results and potential social and environmental conflicts were considered together to select areas that could produce wind energy more efficiently with minimum social and environmental conflicts. Economic, social, and environmental assessment strategies and, procedures provided in this study can be used as an effective decision-making support tool to find sites for offshore wind farm development and various other offshore developments as well.

Here, available measurements of underwater noise from different wind turbines during operation are reviewed to show that source levels are at least 10-20 dB lower than ship noise in the same frequency range. The most important factor explaining the measured sound pressure levels from wind turbines is distance to the turbines with smaller effects of wind speed and turbine size. A simple multi-turbine model demonstrates that cumulative noise levels could be elevated up to a few kilometres from a wind farm under very low ambient noise conditions. In contrast, the noise is well below ambient levels unless it is very close to the individual turbines in locations with high ambient noise from shipping or high wind speeds. The rapid increase in the number and size of offshore wind farms means that the cumulative contribution from the many turbines may be considerable and should be included in assessments for maritime spatial planning purposes as well and environmental impact assessments of individual projects.",,,,,,,,,28,4,0,0,17,0,31,,,0001-4966,1520-8524,,,,,,,,,,"Aarhus Univ, Dept Biosci, Sect Zoophysiol, CF Mollers 3,Bldg 1131, DK-8000 Aarhus C, Denmark",,,,2020-12-18,WOS:000595821200005,33261376,

One method for harvesting animal protein is to grow marine fish. This is widely practiced in coastal environments, but also leads to environmental problems associated with habitat loss and nutrient loading. One alternative is to move marine aquaculture further offshore, away from coastal land-use conflicts and towards ocean currents, which can efficiently dispose wastes. This concept creates a logistical challenge, however, since operators have to transport large amounts of food, fish and fuel to and from offshore cages on a regular basis and in varied weather conditions. In this paper, we discuss the economic feasibility of using offshore oil and gas platforms as bases for open ocean aquaculture in the Gulf of Mexico. We develop net-present value models of a platform-based operation and describe sensitivity analysis of the model output. We conclude that offshore platform-based mariculture may be commercially viable under favorable assumptions, that its viability requires economies of scale and depends principally on the yield per unit of cage volume achieved. The limitations of the analysis are described. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

We modelled the distribution of divers based on two independent data sets, digital aerial surveys and satellite telemetry, in relation to the dynamic offshore environment and anthropogenic pressures. Both data types found that divers were strongly displaced from wind farms in suitable habitat. The displacement effect gradually decreased with distance from the wind farms (being very strong up to 5 km away), but a significant effect could be detected up to 10-15 km away. The telemetry data further indicated that the displacement distance decreased with decreasing visibility. The displacement distance was also shorter during the day than during the night, potentially as a response to aviation and navigation lights of the wind farms.

Efforts to explain this opposition have focused on perceived negative aesthetic and environmental impact. Less attention has been paid to a fuller suite of the perceived risks and benefits associated with new energy technologies. This paper thus investigates impacts of an offshore wind farm pertaining to individual perceptions and judgments, and why risks to some ecosystem services might be cause for greater public concern than others. We find that this difference can be attributed to the affective and intuitive ways in which people perceive risk. Our mixed-methods design used interviews (n = 27) that involved risk-benefit weighting tasks and an animated visualization to help people imagine an offshore wind farm in a familiar place. We found that affectively-loaded impacts (harm to charismatic wildlife and visual intrusion) were assigned greater weight than more easily quantifiable impacts (displacement of fishing, impact to tourism, cost of compliance with regulations). Interviewees identified increased regional energy self-sufficiency as the most valued potential benefit of an offshore wind farm. These results have implications for ecosystem service assessments generally and, more specifically, for our understanding of 'affective' dimensions of development proposals. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

The article provides an overview on the current state of transdisciplinary research on a potential implementation of such a multifunctional use concept on a showcase basis, covering biological, technical, economic and social/policy aspects as well as private-public partnerships and the relevant institutional bodies. We show that the cultivation of seaweeds and blue mussels is biologically and technically feasible in a high-energy environment using modified cultivation strategies. The point of departure of our multi-use concept was that the solid groundings of wind turbines could serve as attachment points for the aquaculture installations and become the key to the successful commercial cultivation of any offshore aquatic organism. However, spaces in between the turbines are also attractive for farming projects, since public access is restricted and thus the cultivation site protected from outside influences. An economic analysis of different operation scenarios indicates that the market price and the annual settlement success of juvenile mussels are the main factors that determine the breakeven point. Social and policy science research reveals that the integration of relevant actors into the development of a multi-use concept for a wind farm-mariculture interaction is a complex and controversial issue. Combining knowledge and experience of wind farm planners as well as mussel fishermen and mariculturists within the framework of national and EU policies is probably the most important component for designing and developing an effective offshore co-management regime to limit the consumption of ocean space.",,,,,,,,,57,0,0,0,27,0,59,,,1438-387X,1438-3888,,,,,,,,,,"Alfred Wegener Inst Polar & Marine Res AWI, D-27550 Bremerhaven, GermanyInst Marine Resources IMARE, D-27570 Bremerhaven, GermanyBremerhaven Univ Appl Sci, D-27568 Bremerhaven, GermanyCtr Trop Marine Ecol ZMT, D-28359 Bremen, GermanyJacobs Univ Bremen gGmbH, D-28759 Bremen, GermanyAlfred Wegener Inst Polar & Marine Res, Biol Inst Helgoland BAH, D-27483 Helgoland, GermanyUniv Bremen, D-28359 Bremen, Germany",Inst Marine Resources IMAREBremerhaven Univ Appl Sci,,,2008-09-01,WOS:000258276800008,,

Yet there are many uncertainties about how wind farms affect marine organisms and their environment. The before-after-control-impact (BACI) design, an approach that compares an impact location with an unaffected control both before and after the intervention, is the most common method used to study how offshore wind farms affect finfish. Unfortunately, this design has several methodological limitations that undermine its ability to detect effects in these studies. An alternative approach, the before-after-gradient (BAG) design, would sample along a gradient with increasing distance from the turbines both before and after the intervention, and could overcome many of the limitations of BACI. The BAG design would eliminate the difficult task of finding a suitable control, allow for the assessment of the spatial scale and extent of wind farm effects, and improve statistical power by incorporating distance as an independent variable in analytical models rather than relegating it to the error term. This article explores the strengths and weaknesses of the BACI and BAG designs in the context of offshore wind development and suggests an approach to incorporating the BAG design into existing fisheries surveys and a regional monitoring framework.",,,,,,,,,31,0,0,0,15,1,32,,,1054-3139,1095-9289,,,,,,,,,,"Integrat Sci Grp, POB 1228, Columbia, MD 21044 USANOAA, Integrated Stat, Natl Marine Fisheries Serv, 1315 East West Highway, Silver Spring, MD 20910 USA",Integrat Sci Grp,,,2020-12-31,WOS:000562460200004,,

Despite the sharp division that exists in stakeholder opinion, particularly related to whether or not such a concept constitutes an act of dumping, there now exists a proactive approach to assessing the need and potential for the formation of reefs using redundant oil and gas platforms. One influential stakeholder, Greenpeace, however, has distanced itself from the process. Liability, loss of access, and safety are of particular concern to fishermen when examining calls for offshore and nearshore reefs. The fishing industry remains unconvinced of the benefits of inshore reefs but maintains an open mind. It remains, however, committed in opposition to offshore reef creation, even more so when suggested in combination with a no fishing policy. The environmental pressure group Greenpeace is opposed to any rigs-to-reefs initiative, seeing this as a means by which offshore operators can circumvent the Oslo and Paris Commission's (OSPAR) Decision 98/3, which calls for complete removal of offshore installations. The importance of cost and the existence of willing reef beneficiaries are highlighted as important to the acceptance and success of a nearshore rigs-to-reefs venture. The creation of offshore reefs faces numerous political hurdles. The importance of a genuine stakeholder dialogue process to integrate scientific and political thinking and to avoid the re-occurrence of an event similar to the Brent Spar is stressed.

Offshore wind farms are typically constructed in near-shore, shallow waters. These waters can be highly productive or provide nursery grounds for fish. EU legislation requires assessment of the environmental impact of the wind farms. The effects on hard and soft substrate fauna, seabirds and marine mammals are most frequently considered. Here we present Landsat-8 imagery that reveals the impact of offshore wind farms on suspended sediments. Turbid wakes of individual turbines are observed that are aligned with tidal currents. They are 30-150 m wide, and several km in length. The environmental impact of these wakes and the source of the suspended material are still unclear, but the wake size warrants further study. The underwater light field will be affected by increased suspended sediments and the turbid wakes could significantly impact sediment transport and downstream sedimentation. The question of whether such features can be detected by other remote sensors is addressed by a theoretical analysis of the signal:noise specification for the Operational Land Imager (OLI), the Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM +), the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR/3), the Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), the Spinning Enhanced Visible and Infrared Imager (SEVIRI), the Flexible Combined Imager (FCI) and the Multispectral Instrument (MSI) and by a demonstration of the impact of processing OLI data for different spatial resolutions.

To some extent these offshore wind farms are planned to be build directly in the main pathways of dense bottom currents propagating into the Baltic Sea. This may have a significant effect for the Baltic Sea ecosystem. In the present study, cylindric structures are assumed for the underwater construction of the individual wind turbines, which are assembled in wind farms with typically 50-100 structures. A parameterisation of the additional mixing and friction due to a structure is developed as an extension of the k-epsilon two-equation turbulence closure model. Results of a high resolution Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) model of the local scale are used to calibrate this parameterisation for hydrostatic coastal ocean models. A Western Baltic Sea hydrodynamic model coupled to the extended turbulence closure model is applied in two different scenarios covering (i) weak and (ii) strong structure-induced mixing due to offshore wind farm distributions in accordance with the present (April 2009) planning situation. The scenarios are completed by two cases with unrealistically extensive wind farms simulating a theoretical future worst case scenario. By means of analysing annual model simulations, it is found that the impact of structure-induced mixing due to realistic wind farm distributions is comparably low with a typical decrease of bottom salinity in the range of 0.1 - 0.3 psu. The annual mean bottom salinity at the outflow from the Arkona Sea through the Bornholm Channel into the direction of the Baltic Proper shows decreases due to mixing from a realistic wind farm distribution of only 0.02 psu which is more than one order of magnitude smaller than the standard deviation of the bottom salinity change.

The many millions of migrating birds that pass these man-made obstacles are protected by international obligations and the subject of public concerns. Yet some bird species are more sensitive to bird-wind turbine mortality than others. This study developed a simple and logical framework for ranking bird species with regard to their relative sensitivity to bird-wind turbine-collisions, and applied it to a data set comprising 38 avian migrant species at the Nysted offshore wind farm in Denmark. Two indicators were selected to characterize the sensitivity of each individual species: 1) relative abundance and 2) demographic sensitivity (elasticity of population growth rate to changes in adult survival). In the case-study from the Nysted offshore wind farm, birds of prey and waterbirds dominated the group of high priority species and only passerines showed a low risk of being impacted by the wind farm. Even where passerines might be present in very high numbers, they often represent insignificant segments of huge reference populations that, from a demographic point of view, are relatively insensitive to wind farm-related adult mortality. It will always be important to focus attention and direct the resources towards the most sensitive species to ensure cost-effective environmental assessments in the future, and in general, this novel index seems capable of identifying the species that are at high risk of being adversely affected by wind farms.

Renewable energy resources, like wind and solar power, generate electricity with little to no global warming emissions and are reliable, affordable and beneficial for health, economy and climate. There are two sectors in wind energy: offshore and onshore. Offshore wind speeds are faster and steadier and coastal areas often exhibit a high energy demand. Offshore wind farms are coming to the Great Lakes. We therefore investigate the potential impact of wind farms on Lake Erie's dynamic and thermal structure using the COHERENS (a Coupled Hydrodynamical-Ecological model for Regional and Shelf Seas) and simulate a large wind farm with 432 offshore turbines located in the shallow southern waters of the central basin. The simulation is run twice to compare physical parameters such as temperature and circulation pattern and velocity results in the absence and presence of a large wind farm. In the case of no wind farm, model results are validated with data from buoys located in Lake Erie, while with the wind farm, the results show that the central basin is impacted by the wind turbines. This occurs because the reduced wind speed and stress leads to less mixing, lower current speeds and higher surface water temperature. There is no significant impact, however, in the eastern and western basins. This research examines Lake Erie, since this lake has a high potential for offshore wind turbine installation due to its proximity to population centers and its shallow depth.",,,,,,,,,3,0,0,0,0,0,3,,,0167-6105,1872-8197,,,,,,,,,,"York Univ, Lassonde Sch Engn, Dept Earth & Space Sci & Engn, 4700 Keele St, Toronto, ON, CanadaRoyal Mil Coll Canada, Dept Mech & Aerosp Engn, Kingston, ON, Canada",,,,2020-03-10,WOS:000515136800014,,

The objective of this article is to promote a sampling strategy to collect data on the different ecosystem compartments of the future Dieppe-Le Treport (DLT) wind farm site, adopting an ecosystem approach, which could be applied to other OWFs for the implementation of a trophic network analysis. For that purpose, an Ecopath model is used here to derive indices from Ecological Network Analysis (ENA) to investigate the ecosystem structure and functioning. The results show that the ecosystem is most likely detritus-based, associated with a biomass dominated by bivalves, which could act as a dead end for a classic trophic food web since their consumption by top predators is low in comparison to their biomass.

As the appropriate locations become fewer and fewer to build onshore wind farms, significant attention has been drawn to the wind energy industry to build offshore wind farms. The terrain effect has fewer effects offshore than onshore since the sea level is flat and no artificial buildings are built there. The coastal line of the Great Lakes is one of those areas that not only has great wind energy potential but is also near the high population coastal cities which is short of the land surface. This article makes the detailed statistical analysis of 1-year offshore wind data in Lake Erie from a Light Detection and Ranging system placed on a water intake crib 4 miles away from near the coast of Cleveland. For comparison purpose, a nearby onshore wind monitoring station's data have also been analyzed to study the wind and power characteristics. Specifically, the statistical analysis of the data includes Weibull shape and scale factors, the monthly average of the wind speed, turbulence intensity, and wind power density. In addition, two site-matching commercial wind turbines with 50 (Vestas (R) 39) and 80 m (Vestas (R) V90) hub heights have been chosen to estimate the 1-year energy output.

The study explores the macrozoobenthos (biofouling) colonization at an offshore platform which is comparable to offshore wind turbine foundations. A total of 183 single samples were taken and the parameters water depth and time were considered comparing biofouling masses and communities. The blue mussel Mytilus edulis, Anthozoa and the Amphipoda Jassa spp. were the dominant species. The community from the 1 m zone and those from the 5 and 20-28 m zones can clearly be differentiated. The 10 m zone community represents the transition between the M. edulis dominated 1 m and 5 m zones and the Anthozoa dominated 20-28 m zone. In the future offshore wind farms, thousands of wind turbine foundations will provide habitat for a hard bottom fauna which is otherwise restricted to the sparse rocky habitats scattered within extensive sedimentary soft bottoms of the German Bight. However, offshore wind power foundations cannot be considered natural rock equivalents as they selectively increase certain natural hard bottom species. The surface of the construction (1280 m(2)) was covered by an average of 4300 kg biomass. This foundation concentrates on its footprint area (1024 m(2)) 35 times more macrozoobenthos biomass than the same area of soft bottom in the German exclusive economic zone (0.12 kg m(-2)), functioning as a biomass hotspot. Concerning the temporal biomass variation, we assume that at least 2700 kg biomass was exported on a yearly basis. 345 x 10(4) single mussel shells of different sizes were produced during the study period. It is anticipated that the M. edulis abundance will increase in the North Sea due to the expansion of the offshore wind farm development. This will result in the enhanced production of secondary hard substrate (mussel shells) and its associated fauna and will intensify filtration rates of the seawater. This predicted ecological system change is coined the 'Mytilusation' of the German Bight. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

This project equipped a standard work-class ROV with a light-weight stereo-video camera system to collect high definition imagery of fish and habitats formed by marine growth associated with Woodside Energy's Goodwyn Alpha Platform jacket (GWA) 138 km offshore of Dampier, north-west Australia. ROV video surveys were rapidly performed by industry on four faces of the GWA jacket, from the surface to the seabed at 130 m, yielding 1 h and 14 min of imagery. The stereo-video cameras continued to film during standard ROV operations collecting a further 150 h of HD imagery, used to build a comprehensive fish species list. A total of 8676 individual fish from at least 57 species and 20 families, with an estimated combined mass of 8719 kg, were recorded from the vertical transects of four faces of the jacket.

Eleven broad marine growth types were observed with encrusting/enveloping species (brown algae, filamentous mat, coralline algae, calcite) and hard corals (Tubastrea sp.) present in the greatest coverage. Both marine growth and fish assemblages changed markedly with depth.

Since sites for the erection of wind turbines became scarce on land, ambitious plans for the offshore regions have arisen. There have been applications for 33 sites within the German Exclusive Economic Zone in the North and Baltic Seas, some of which entail several hundred individual turbines. Eleven pilot projects are approved, and two others rejected. As several hundred million birds cross the North and Baltic Seas at least twice every year, the Offshore Installations Ordinance says that licensing will not be given if the obstacles jeopardize bird migration. Birds are potentially endangered by offshore wind farms through collisions, barrier effects and habitat loss. To judge these potential risks, the occurrence of birds in space and time as well as details on their behaviour in general ( migration, influence of weather) and their behaviour when facing wind farms ( flight distances, evasive movements, influence of light, collision risk) need to be determined. Furthermore, the influences of construction and maintenance works must be considered. Since 2003, we have investigated year-round bird migration over the North Sea with regard to offshore wind farms. The main objectives were to assess data on the aforementioned aspects of bird migration over sea. These data can contribute to, for example, estimations of collision risks at offshore wind farms, the possible impacts on bird populations and possible mitigation measures. Results from measurements with different techniques, including radar, thermal imaging, and visual and acoustic observations, were compiled. The findings confirm that large numbers of diurnal and nocturnal migrants cross the German Bight. Migration was observed all year round but with considerable variation of intensity, time, altitude and species, depending on season and weather conditions. Almost half of the birds fly at 'dangerous' altitudes with regard to future wind farms. In addition, the number of individuals in reverse migration is considerable, which increases the risk of collision. We demonstrated that, especially under poor visibility, terrestrial birds are attracted by illuminated offshore obstacles and that some species collide in large numbers. Passerines are most frequently involved in collisions. Even if the findings regarding collisions at a research platform cannot be directly applied to offshore wind farms, they do show that on a few nights per year a large number of avian interactions at offshore plants can be expected, especially in view of the number and planned area of projected wind farms. We suggest abandonment of wind farms in zones with dense migration, turning off turbines on nights predicted to have adverse weather and high migration intensity, and actions to make wind turbines more recognizable to birds, including modification of the illumination to intermittent rather than continuous light, as the most appropriate mitigation measures. We further conclude that a combination of methods is necessary to describe the complex patterns of migration over the sea. The recordings are to be continued with the aim of refining the results presented here, and of developing a model for 'forecasting' bird migration over the German Bight. We expect more information on avoidance behaviour and collisions after the construction of a pilot wind park.",,,,,Annual Spring Conference of the British-Ornithologists-UnionAnnual Spring Conference of the British-Ornithologists-Union,"APR 01-03, 2005APR 01-03, 2005",British Ornithologists UnionBritish Ornithologists Union,"Univ Leicester, Leicester, ENGLANDUniv Leicester, Leicester, ENGLAND",111,5,0,0,100,1,151,,,0019-1019,,,,,,,,,,,"Inst Avian Res Vogelwarte Helgoland, Inselstn Helgoland, D-27494 Helgoland, GermanyInst Avian Res Vogelwarte Helgoland, D-26386 Wilhelmshaven, Germany",Inst Avian Res Vogelwarte HelgolandInst Avian Res Vogelwarte Helgoland,,,2006-03-01,WOS:000243474900008,,

Despite a great number of local impact studies for selected marine populations, the regional ecosystem impacts of offshore wind farm structures are not yet well assessed nor understood. Our study investigates whether the accumulation of epifauna, dominated by the filter feeder Mytilus edulis (blue mussel), on turbine structures affects pelagic primary productivity and ecosystem functioning in the southern North Sea. We estimate the anthropogenically increased potential distribution based on the current projections of turbine locations and reported patterns of M. edulis settlement. This distribution is integrated through the Modular Coupling System for Shelves and Coasts to state-of-the-art hydrodynamic and ecosystem models. Our simulations reveal non-negligible potential changes in regional annual primary productivity of up to 8% within the offshore wind farm area, and induced maximal increases of the same magnitude in daily productivity also far from the wind farms. Our setup and modular coupling are effective tools for system scale studies of other environmental changes arising from large-scale offshore wind-farming such as ocean physics and distributions of pelagic top predators.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2022-11-23,PPRN:12878168,,

However, many ecologists have suggested that offshore wind farms may have severe negative impacts on wildlife, especially seabirds. Thus, balancing seabird conservation with human energy demands is necessary when developing wind farms. Bird sensitivity mapping is a powerful and practical tool that can determine turbine collision risk within specific areas; however, sensitivity maps have seldom been generated for seabirds. Focusing on the Slaty-backed gull (Larus schistisagus), a red-listed species that often collides with wind turbines, we determined factors affecting habitat selection with the goal of reducing negative impacts of offshore wind farms. We then generated a sensitivity map using habitat modeling. GPS loggers set to record at 5-minute intervals between June and August 2018 were attached to six Slaty-backed gulls residing in Ochiishi Bay, Nemuro Prefecture, Japan. A Gaussian mixed model indicated that habitat selection was related to food availability (as determined by sea surface temperature and chlorophyll a content) and distance to the nest site. Sea surface temperature and chlorophyll a content were positively related area visitation frequency of Slaty-backed gulls, whereas distance to nest site was negatively correlated. Moreover, area visitation frequency was unchanged when the distance from the nest site was > 25 km. The sensitivity map indicated that areas both near and far from nest sites with potentially abundant food resources were high-risk areas with respect to turbine collisions for Slaty-backed gulls. Based on these results, we advocate the use of sensitivity mapping to reduce interactions between offshore wind farms and seabirds, especially for species that often forage far from their nest sites.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,1342-4327,,,,,,,,,,,"Obihiro Univ Agr & Vet Med, Lab Conserva Ecol, Nishi 2 Sen 11,Inadacho, Obihiro, Hokkaido, 0808555, Japan",,,,2021-06-27,ZOOREC:ZOOR15707047296,,

These platforms serve as artificial reefs on the continental shelf, where, until their introduction, shallow hard substrata were rare. This newly available substrate has helped to expand scleractinian coral populations in the GOM. Here, we conduct molecular genetic analyses on adult scleractinian corals on the Flower Garden Banks (FGB) coral reefs (similar to 180 knn SE of Galveston, TX) and on surrounding oil and gas platforms. We have attempted to determine the degree of genetic affinity among the natural populations and those on the surrounding platforms. The three most abundant hermatypic scleractinian species were sampled: Madracis decactis, Diploria strigosa, and Montastraea cavernosa. Tissue samples were collected from the East (E-) and West (W-) FGB, and seven platforms within a 65 km radius of the FGB, at a depth range of 5-37 m. Genetic variation was assessed using Amplified Fragment Length Polymorphisms (AFLPs). The large number of polymorphic markers generated by AFLPs allowed for the use of standard genetic analysis tools (AMOVA) as well as population allocation techniques (AFLPOP). AMOVA analyses indicated that the E- and W-FGB were genetically homogeneous for populations of Madracis decactis and Diploria strigosa; Montastraea cavernosa populations, however, were significantly different there. In all species, genetic distance (FST) increased significantly with geographic distance between populations. In the brooding species Madracis decactis, this pattern was even stronger when one considered distance between the platforms and the perimeters of the FGB, particularly the nearest FGB, suggesting that the FGB may be a source of larvae for platform populations. AFLPOP analyses showed that the degree of self-allocation to home sites also increased with inter-site distance. Cross allocations between sites dropped significantly and exponentially in all species within only one to several kms of the FGB. Madracis decactis, a brooder with extended larval release periods and near-immediate settlement competence, showed greater affinity to the FGB with distance than Diploria strigosa, a broadcaster. This brooder appears to be more effective at colonizing small, nearby target sites and expanding its geographic range at the meso-scale. The low degree of genetic affinity exhibited by all species on the platforms may be attributed to genetic drift/founder effect or relatively small samples sizes, although total populations were sampled. In general, genetic affinity decreased with inter-site distance. Young coral populations are highly differentiated at the meso-scale during early stages of community succession, implying that much time and repeated colonization of patchy habitats around larger potential larval sources will be required before genetic equilibrium or homogeneity is reached.

Here, we review the current understanding of impacts of wind energy activities on fisheries resources, taking into account the varied noise conditions that occur from site survey to decommissioning.

The recent Italian technical referendum (2016) a public consultation inviting people to express their opinion by voting to change the rules on the length of licence duration and the decommissioning of offshore oil and gas platform drilling licences inspired the creation of a systematic map of evidence to scope and quantify the effects of off-shore extraction platforms on Mediterranean marine ecosystems. The map was aimed as a useful model to standardise a minimal informational threshold, which can inform public opinion at the beginning of any public consultation. Produced by synthesising scientific information, the map represents a reliable layer for any future sustainable strategy in the Mediterranean basin by: (i) providing a summary of the effects of marine gas and oil platforms on the Mediterranean marine ecosystem, (ii) describing the best known affected components on which the biggest monitoring efforts have been focused, and (iii) strengthening the science-policy nexus by offering a credible, salient and legitimate knowledge baseline to both public opinion and decision-makers.

In this paper, a three-dimensional porous model, based on Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes equations and Biot's poro-elastic theory, is developed by integrating 3D wave and seabed models to simulate the wave-seabed-structure interaction around the high-rising structure foundation used in the Donghai offshore wind farm. Then parametric studies for wave and seabed characteristics on soil response around the wind turbine foundation are conducted. Liquefaction potential and seabed protection methodology are investigated in the last section. The main results concluded from the numerical analysis are as follows: (i) both larger wave height and longer wave period will result in higher wave pressure on the structure and seabed; (ii) the existence of the structure has a significant effect on the wave transformation and the distribution of wave-induced pore pressure; (iii) wave height, wave period, soil permeability and degree of saturation play critical roles on dynamic soil behavior; and (iv) original seabed can be protected from liquefaction by replacing the existing layers.

Numerous researches have been done to consider the possible effects of wind farms. However, to date little research investigated actual effects on the ichthyofauna.This study provides the first insights into the use of the artificial hard substrates by Trisopterus luscus (pouting) at the Thorntonbank wind farm in the Belgian part of the North Sea.Scuba diving operated visual surveys around one wind turbine revealed a distinctly higher pouting population size and biomass (i.e. 22 000 individuals yielding a total biomass of 2700 kg) as compared to the population size present at the soft sediments surrounding the wind turbines. Stomach content analyses further demonstrated the dietary preference for prey species that lived on the turbines (i.e. Jassa herdmani and Pisidia longicornis). Yet, the present study clearly demonstrates that wind turbines built at sea may attract fish populations considerably, possibly related to the enhanced provision of resident food items on the turbines.

Scour leads to the excavation of sediments around the foundations of structures, reducing the safe capacity of the structures. The phenomenon of pier scour is extremely complex because of the combined effects of the vortex system involving time-dependent flow patterns and sediment transport mechanisms. A real-time scour monitoring system can improve the safety of structures and afford cost-effective operations by preventing premature or unnecessary maintenance. This paper proposes an on-site scour monitoring system using visible light communication (VLC) modules for offshore wind turbine installations. A flume experiment revealed that the system was highly sensitive and accurate in monitoring seabed scour processes. This arrayed-VLC sensory system, proposed in this paper, has considerable potential for safety monitoring and also can contribute to improving the accuracy of empirical scour formulas for sustainable maintenance in the life cycle of offshore structures.",,,,,,,,,4,0,0,0,0,0,4,,,2073-4441,,,,,,,,,,,"Natl Ctr Res Earthquake Engn, 200,Sec 3,Xinhai Rd, Taipei 106, TaiwanNatl Chiao Tung Univ, Dept Civil Engn, 1001 Univ Rd, Hsinchu 300, TaiwanNatl Taipei Univ Technol, Dept Elect Engn, 1,Sec 3,Zhongxiao E Rd, Taipei 106, TaiwanChung Yuan Christian Univ, Dept Civil Engn, 200 Chung Pei Rd, Taoyuan 320, TaiwanNatl Taiwan Univ, Hydrotech Res Inst, 1,Sec 4,Roosevelt Rd, Taipei 106, Taiwan",Natl Ctr Res Earthquake Engn,,,2019-08-26,WOS:000480632300171,,

This study investigates the potential impact of the construction of one of the first major, offshore wind farms (> 100 MW) on harbour porpoises Phocoena phocoena by means of acoustic porpoise detectors (T-PODs) monitoring porpoise echolocation activity. The monitoring program was established as a modified BACI (before, after, control, impact) design, with 6 monitoring stations equally distributed between the impact area and a nearby reference area. Mean waiting times, defined as the period between 2 consecutive encounters of echolocation activity, increased from 6 h in the baseline period to 3 d in the wind farm area during the construction. This increase was 6 times larger than changes observed in the reference area. One specific construction activity, involving the ramming and vibration of steel sheet piles into the seabed, was associated with an additional significant increase in waiting time of 4 to 41 h, in both the construction and reference areas. Assuming that echolocation activity is related to harbour porpoise density, the analysis shows that their habitat-use changed substantially, with the porpoises leaving the construction area of the offshore wind farm. Acoustic monitoring from fixed positions provides data with a high temporal resolution, but low spatial resolution, which can be analysed at a variety of scales, and can be applied to harbour porpoises and other echolocating cetaceans.",,,,,,,,,170,1,0,0,135,0,183,,,0171-8630,1616-1599,,,,,,,,,,"Natl Environm Res Inst, DK-4000 Roskilde, Denmark",,,,2006-01-01,WOS:000241282700025,,

Examples include oil and gas platforms, wind turbines and shipwrecks. One of the hypothesised effects is an increased genetic connectivity among natural populations due to new populations growing on man-made structures that may act as stepping stones. However, few data are available on genetic connectivity among organisms inhabiting artificial offshore structures. Here, we present a study on the common fouling amphipod Jassa herdmani from offshore structures in the southern North Sea. Partial mitochondrial DNA sequences (cytochrome-c-oxidase 1, N = 514) were obtained from artificial structures at 17 locations in the southern North Sea, including 13 shipwrecks, 2 wind turbines and 2 platforms. Samples from these locations were significantly differentiated, meaning that strong population structure exists for this species in the area. Levels of intraspecific variation were consistent with stable population sizes. No evidence was found for isolation by distance. Using coalescent simulations, the oldest population subdivision events were estimated to date back to the time the study area was flooded following the Last Glacial Maximum. We therefore tentatively conclude that J. herdmani may have colonised man-made structures from previously existing populations on the sea floor, and that the increase in offshore installations has not led to an overall increase in genetic connectivity for this species.",,,,,,,,,5,0,0,0,5,0,5,,,0171-8630,1616-1599,,,,,,,,,,"NIOZ Royal Netherlands Inst Sea Res, Dept Coastal Syst, POB 59, NL-1790 AB Den Burg, NetherlandsUniv Utrecht, POB 59, NL-1790 AB Den Burg, NetherlandsHelmholtz Ctr Polar & Marine Res, Alfred Wegener Inst, Dept Funct Ecol, Handelshafen 12, D-27570 Bremerhaven, GermanyHelmholtz Inst Funct Marine Biodivers, Ammerlander Heerstr 231, D-26129 Oldenburg, GermanyWageningen Univ & Res, Anim Breeding & Genom, Droevendaalsesteeg 1, NL-6708 PB Wageningen, NetherlandsWageningen Marine Res, POB 57, NL-1780 AB Den Helder, NetherlandsWageningen Univ, Chair Grp Aquat Ecol & Water Qual Management, Droevendaalsesteeg 3a, NL-6708 PD Wageningen, Netherlands",Helmholtz Inst Funct Marine Biodivers,,,2019-04-18,WOS:000485723200009,,

GIS layers were created and a weighted overlay GIS model based on the above mentioned criteria was built to identify suitable sites for hosting a new offshore wind energy farm. Results showed that most of Abu Dhabi offshore areas were unsuitable, largely due to the presence of restricted zones (marine protected areas, oil extraction platforms and oil pipelines in particular). However, some suitable sites could be identified, especially around Delma Island and North of Jabal Barakah in the Western Region. The environmental impact of potential wind farm locations and associated cables on the marine ecology was examined to ensure minimal disturbance to marine life.

In Taiwan, where the further development of nuclear power is suspended due to public antinuclear sentiment, offshore wind farms have been heavily promoted as a way of meeting electricity demand. The planned site for offshore wind farms, mainly the intertidal zone along the coast of Changhua County, overlaps with both oyster farms and the habitat of Taiwanese humpbacked dolphins, categorized as a critically endangered species by the International Union for Conservation of Nature. This has resulted in a clash between conserving the oyster farming landscape, protecting an endangered species, and developing green energy. Facing this dilemma, pro-wind farm discourses that highlight concerns about global climate change have gradually supplanted those stressing the welfare of oysters and dolphins, even though the latter have been used successfully as local icons by movements opposing previous development projects on the intertidal zone. This article reconsiders the politics of territorialization implied by the green label affixed to offshore wind farm projects and other forms of green energy in general. As such, the meaning of offshore wind farms, as a newly discovered energy resource, is intertwined with the changing meanings of both dolphins and oyster farms, as rival nonhuman objects of resource exploitation and natural conservation. The territorialization of such resources in the emerging discursive space of green energy has proceeded via relational placemaking with nonlinear connections among multiple human and nonhuman elements.

Results identify 18 species belonging to 6 orders, 9 families, and 15 genera. Peciformes are the largest percentage order (50%) and Gobiidae the largest percentage family (44.4%) within this order. Dominant species in spring are Cynoglossus joyneri, Collichthys lucidus, Chaeturichthys stigmatias, and Trypauchen vagina, and dominant species in autumn are C. lucidus, Harpadon nehereus, and Coilia mystus; C. lucidus is the dominant species with respect to its representation in both season. Cluster and non-metric multidimensional scaling indicate that the fish community at this offshore wind farm can be clustered into two groups, spring and autumn assemblages, and ANOSIM analysis indicates significant differences in the community structure between these two groups (R = 0.851, P < 0.01). The relationship between fish community pattern and water temperature and salinity is determined as dominant using the BIOENV program, with a correlation coefficient of 0.791. Results show that fish such as C. lucidus, C. mystus, and H. nehereus migrate annually to the wind farm for spawning and feeding.

There are public concerns that these man-made structures will have a significant negative impact on the many bird populations migrating and wintering at sea. We assess the degree of usefulness and the limitations of different remote technologies for studying bird behaviour in relation to bird-turbine collisions at offshore wind farms. Radar is one of the more powerful tools available to describe the movement of birds in three-dimensional space. Although radar cannot measure bird-turbine collisions directly, it offers the opportunity to quantify input data for collision models. Thermal Animal Detection System ( TADS) is an infra red-based technology developed as a means of gathering highly specific information about actual collision rates, and also for parameterizing predictive collision models. TADS can provide information on avoidance behaviour of birds in close proximity to turbine rotor-blades, flock size and flight altitude. This review also assesses the potential of other ( some as yet undeveloped) techniques for collecting information on bird flight and behaviour, both pre- and post-construction of the offshore wind farms.

As demand for lift vessels increases, their availability to match a future large specific project's schedule cannot be guaranteed. Consequently, an alternative wind turbine installation vessel design has been developed for not only installing simultaneously two wind turbines in a single piece, but also with a high air gap (up to 70 ft). This paper presents this new design.The new vessel design consists of a catamaran shaped vessel with dimensions that permit it to go around variety of substructures (piles foundation, tripod, concrete foundation or floating substructure) for float-over installation of wind turbines.For the float-over operation, a thorough understanding of dynamic behavior and environmental conditions are necessary to allow the design load to be assessed, with the objective to minimize the risk and maximize the operating sea states. This paper gives a description of how the substructure / Wind turbine / transition piece / floating unit can be modeled.This new vessel design greatly extends the geographical range for offshore wind turbine installation using the float-over method and offers a cost effective alternative to relying on crane vessels.",,,,,"28th International Conference on Ocean, Offshore and Arctic Engineering28th International Conference on Ocean, Offshore and Arctic Engineering","MAY 31-JUN 05, 2009MAY 31-JUN 05, 2009","ASME, Ocean, Offshore & Arctic Engn DivASME, Ocean, Offshore & Arctic Engn Div","Honolulu, HIHonolulu, HI",1,0,0,0,0,0,1,,,,,978-0-7918-4344-4,,,,,,,,,"Technip, Houston, TX 77056 USA",Technip,,,2009-01-01,WOS:000286404300091,,

Scientists have hypothesized that artificial reefs and platforms improve and/or diversify habitat, increase resources, modify the assemblages of organisms in the region, or concentrate existing resources. The placement of these de facto reefs has undoubtedly impacted the regional marine community, although little information is available. Only recently have assessment methods been developed to test these and other hypotheses concerning artificial reefs.At the shallowest site, South Timbalier 54 (ST54, water depth 22 m), the decline in fish density with distance from the platform was precipitous; generally, after a distance of 18 m, fish densities were similar to that of the open waters of the northern Gulf of Mexico. At the deeper sites (Green Canyon 18, GC18, water depth 219 m; Grand Isle 94, GI94, 60 m), a drop in fish density with distance from the site existed; however, fish density was higher at greater distances from the platform. As we defined it, the area of influence extended 10 m at GC18 and 18 m at GI94. Six species made up more than 90% of the fishes observed at each site on any survey and platform assemblages could be characterized as not specious and dominated by a few species at each structure. By site, the dominant six species (highest to lowest abundance) were GC18: creole-fish Paranthias furcifer, blue runner Caranx crysos, Bermuda chub Kyphosus sectatrix, almaco jack Seriola rivoliana, greater amberjack S. dumerili, and great barracuda Sphyraena barracuda; GI94: blue runner, horse-eye jack C. latus, red snapper Lutjanus campechaaus, mangrove snapper (also known as gray snapper) L. griseus, gray triggerfish Balistes capriscus, and great barracuda; ST54: Atlantic spadefish Chaetodipterus faber, bluefish Pomatomus saltatrix, blue runner, mangrove snapper, red snapper, and sheepshead Archosargus probatocephalus. While the species assemblages found at each site were unique, the dominant species at each site was different and some overlap of observed species existed between sites. Seasonal migrations were common at each of the study sites. Mean densities observed were 0.333 (+/-0.034) fish/m(3) at ST54, 0.496 (+/-0.017) fish/m(3) at GI94, and 0.029 (+/-0.003) fish/ m(3) at GC18.

These offshore wind farms will be integrated into an ecosystem already facing multiple anthropogenic disturbances such as maritime transport, fisheries, oyster and mussel farming, and sediment dredging. Currently no integrated, ecosystem-based study on the effects of the construction and exploitation of offshore wind farms exists, where biological approaches generally focused on the conservation of some valuable species or groups of species. Complementary trophic web modelling tools were applied to the Bay of Seine ecosystem (to the 50 km(2) area covered by the wind farm) to analyse the potential impacts of benthos and fish aggregation caused by the introduction of additional hard substrates from the piles and the turbine scour protections. An Ecopath ecosystem model composed of 37 compartments, from phytoplankton to seabirds, was built to describe the situation before the construction of the wind farm. Then, an Ecosim projection over 30 years was performed after increasing the biomass of targeted benthic and fish compartments. Ecological Network Analysis (ENA) indices were calculated for the two periods, before and after, to compare network functioning and the overall structural properties of the food web. Our main results showed (1) that the total ecosystem activity, the overall system omnivory (proportion of generalist feeders), and the recycling increased after the construction of the wind farm; (2) that higher trophic levels such as piscivorous fish species, marine mammals, and seabirds responded positively to the aggregation of biomass on piles and turbine scour protections; and (3) a change in keystone groups after the construction towards more structuring and dominant compartments. Nonetheless, these changes could be considered as limited impacts of the wind farm installation on this coastal trophic web structure and functioning. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Seven flatfish, (American plaice Hippoglossoides platessoides, fourspot flounder Paralichthys oblongus, Gulf stream flounder Citharichthys arctifrons, summer flounder Paralichthys dentatus, windowpane flounder Scophthalmus aquosus, winter flounder Pseudopleuronectes americanus, and yellowtail flounder Pleuronectes ferruginea) were collected in the study area. Winter flounder, windowpane and fourspot flounder accounted for 83% of all flatfish collected. Flatfish exhibited spatial and temporal variation in abundance, size, and condition, but this variation was not consistent with either positive or negative effects of wind farm construction or operation. Lower winter flounder abundances during the pile-driving time period and higher abundances during the cable-laying time period in the reference and wind farm areas suggest regionwide population fluctuations occurred. Although noise from pile driving may have been detectable in the reference areas, other flatfish abundances were not lower during this time period. Although no artificial reef effect was found for flatfish, negative impacts from construction activity and wind farm operation also were not evident.",,,,,,,,,17,2,0,0,11,0,20,,,1385-1101,1873-1414,,,,,,,,,,"INSPIRE Environm, 88 Silva Lane,Suite 4, Middletown, RI 02842 USA",INSPIRE Environm,,,2018-08-02,WOS:000439673500003,,

Survey effort amounted to 44 739 km during which a total of 5121 harbour porpoises was detected, including 258 calves. Our data suggest that porpoises move to distinct areas on a seasonal basis as their biological requirements change. They move into German waters in early spring, reach high numbers in early summer and move out of the area in autumn. The abundance estimates for the German exclusive economic zone and 12 n mile zone were highest in spring (55 048 animals; 95% CI: 32 395 to 101 671) and summer (49 687 animals; 95% CI: 29 009 to 96 385) and lowest in autumn with 15394 animals (95% CI: 8906 to 29 470). Important aggregation zones were detected in offshore waters: in spring, 2 hot spots, Borkum Reef Ground and Sylt Outer Reef (SOR), were identified as key foraging areas. In summer, only the large hot spot SOR persisted, causing a strong north-south density gradient. In autumn, porpoises were more evenly distributed. Most mother-calf pairs were observed during spring and summer in the SOR, underlining its importance as a foraging area when reproductive costs are high. Spatial overlap exists between important areas for porpoises and areas where offshore wind farms are currently licensed or planned.

Wind power is the most advanced technology within offshore renewable energy sources and there is an urgent need to study its impacts on the marine environment. To test the hypothesis that offshore wind power increases the abundance of reef species relative to a reference area, we conduct an experiment on the model species common shore crab (Carcinus maenas). Overall, 3962 crabs were captured, observed, marked and released in 2011 and 1995 crabs in 2012. Additionally, carapace size, sex distribution, color morphs and body condition was recorded from captured crabs. We observed very low recapture rates at all sites during both years which made evaluating differences in population sizes very difficult. However, we were able to estimate population densities from the capture record for all three sites. There was no obvious artificial reef effect in the Lillgrund wind farm, but a spill-over effect to nearby habitats cannot be excluded. We could not find any effect of the wind farm on either, morphs, sex distribution or condition of the common shore crab.

The objectives of this study were (1) to document the fish assemblages on the mussel reefs, (2) to investigate the spatial patterns of use of parts of mussel reefs by various fish species and (3) to compare species assemblages, population densities and fish sizes on the mussel reefs with those on adjacent platform bottoms. We observed at least 35 species on the mussel mounds, 18 of which were rockfishes (genus Sebastes). Most of the species that were found both in large numbers and were encountered at a number of mussel mounds were solitary, benthic forms. Most species appeared to be non-randomly distributed among parts of the mussel mounds with different percent shell cover. All species combined and all rockfish species tended to be slightly but significantly over-represented on areas of 80-100% cover (all species: chi(2) = 227, n = 5, P < 0.001, all rockfishes: chi(2) = 211, n = 5, P < 0.001). Species richness, density (fish 100 m(-2)) and mean lengths of fishes were all less on the mussel mounds than on the platform bottoms.

One of the seabirds considered most at risk from collision with offshore wind turbines is the northern gannet Morus bassanus. The recommended correction for gannet nocturnal flight activity is currently a highly precautionary value. Here we use data from tracking studies to derive evidence-based correction factors for nocturnal flight activity of adult gannets during the breeding and nonbreeding seasons, and of immature gannets during the summer prospecting phase. Flight and diving activity of gannets was minimal during the night, astronomical and nautical twilight, for adults during the breeding season and nonbreeding season, and for immatures. Some flight activity occurred during the short period of civil twilight, but on average at about half the level seen during the day. Based on evidence from numerous tracking studies, we recommend that precautionary values of the nocturnal (sunset to sunrise) flight activity factor for estimating collision risk should be 8% of daytime flight activity during the breeding season and 3% of daytime flight activity during the nonbreeding season. Use of these evidence-based correction factors will improve the accuracy, and reduce the uncertainty of collision risk models, providing a more reliable assessment of the impacts of offshore wind farms on gannets.",,,,,,,,,5,0,0,0,5,0,5,,,0195-9255,1873-6432,,,,,,,,,,"MacArthur Green, 93 South Woodside Rd, Glasgow G20 6NT, Lanark, ScotlandUniv Glasgow, Inst Biodivers Anim Hlth & Comparat Med, Glasgow G12 8QQ, Lanark, ScotlandUniv Kiel, Res & Technol Ctr FTZ, Hafentorn 1, D-25761 Busum, GermanyCtr Ecol & Hydrol Edinburgh, Bush Estate, Penicuik EH26 0QB, Midlothian, Scotland",MacArthur Green,,,2018-12-28,WOS:000447480100001,,

Wind maps are derived from a total of 30 ERS-2 SAR scenes and 11 Envisat ASAR scenes over two large offshore wind farms in Denmark: Horns Rev in the North Sea (80 turbines) and Nysted in the Baltic Sea (78 turbines). The wind farms are the world's largest to date. For the first time, high-resolution SAR-derived wind speed images are utilized to identify regions of reduced wind speed and high turbulence intensity (i.e. wind wakes) downstream of wind turbine arrays. After quality control, 19 SAR scenes are available for the study of wake effects. A decrease of the mean wind speed is found as the wind flows through the wind farms, leaving a velocity deficit of 8-9% on average, immediately downstream of the wind turbine arrays. From this point, wind speed recovers to within 2% of the free stream velocity over a distance of 5-20 kin depending on the ambient wind speed, the atmospheric stability and the number of turbines in operation. The wake magnitude and extent found from SAR wind maps is consistent with in situ measurements and results from wake models. The standard deviation of SAR-derived wind speeds is an indicator of turbulence intensity. Added turbulence intensity downstream of a wind farm is found for 7 of the 19 cases. Turbulence intensity is not as easily identified from SAR images as changes in the mean wind speed. This may be due to a low impact of wind turbine generated turbulence on the sea surface where SAR measurements are obtained. (C) 2005 Elsevier Inc.

Constant soil-structure and structure-environment (wave and wind) interaction calls for comprehensive understanding of structural behavior under complex loading patterns. Due to the dynamics of the Wind Turbine Generator (WTG), dynamic response of the substructure and foundation should fall in pre-defined, narrow band response spectrum. Procurement and fabrication of these structures is another limiting constraint to consider in the design process. Availability and limitations of manufacturers and simplicity of construction are critical parameters in the successful design process. Most of the structural components need to be transported to the installation site in the sea and then installed with specialized marine vessels. Both the transportation and installation of offshore wind farm substructures and foundations utilize expensive marine equipment and the offshore processes are weather limited. Keystone Engineering's Inward Battered Guided Structure (IBGS) provides an optimum solution to the challenges of design, manufacturing, transportation and installation in a range of shelf water depths. Flexible design configurations provide freedom for the designer to add or remove elements without loss of structural integrity, to allow adjustment adjust for resonance response avoidance. Efficiency is achieved in manufacturing by reducing the number of members and weldments and thus, minimizing the lifts of subassemblies. Ease of transportation with marine vessels is improved by reducing the footprint space requirements and the choreographed installation procedure can lower the vessel charter costs significantly.

SEAs require extensive mapping of waterbird densities to define breeding and feeding areas of importance and sensitivity. Use of extensive large scale weather, military, and air traffic control surveillance radar is recommended, to define areas, routes and behaviour of migrating birds, and to determine avian migration corridors in three dimensions. EIAs for individual OWFs should define the key avian species present; as well as assess the hazards presented to birds in terms of avoidance behaviour, habitat change and collision risk. Such measures, however, are less helpful in assessing cumulative impacts. Using aerial survey, physical habitat loss, modification, or gain and effective habitat loss through avoidance behaviour can be measured using bird densities as a proxy measure of habitat availability. The energetic consequences of avoidance responses and habitat change should be modelled to estimate fitness costs and predict impacts at the population level. Our present ability to model collision risk remains poor due to lack of data on species-specific avoidance responses. There is therefore an urgent need to gather data on avoidance responses; energetic consequences of habitat modification and avoidance flights and demographic sensitivity of key species, most affected by OWFs.

We use a three-dimensional biophysical model to assess whether larval dispersal via currents from harbors to platforms and among platforms is a plausible mechanism to explain the change in distribution of Watersipora and to predict potential spread to other platforms in the future. Hull fouling is another possible mechanism to explain the change in distribution of Watersipora. We find that larval dispersal via currents could account for the increase in distribution of Watersipora from one to four platforms and that Watersipora is unlikely to spread from these four platforms to additional platforms through larval dispersal. Our results also suggest that larvae with PLDs of 24 hours or less released from offshore platforms can attain much greater dispersal distances than larvae with PLDs of 24 hours or less released from nearshore habitat. We hypothesize that the enhanced dispersal distance of larvae released from offshore platforms is driven by a combination of the offshore hydrodynamic environment, larval behavior, and larval release above the seafloor.",,,,,,,,,21,0,0,0,18,0,23,,,1932-6203,,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Earth Res Inst, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USAUniv Calif Santa Barbara, Inst Marine Sci, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USABur Ocean Energy Management, Pacific Reg, Camarillo, CA USA",Bur Ocean Energy Management,,,2016-04-27,WOS:000373121800048,27031827,

However, assessments are often based on incomplete data, or fail to consider variation in risk between sexes and at different times of year. We tracked northern gannets foraging from the world's largest colony (Bass Rock, Scotland) across five consecutive breeding seasons. We examine how seasonal and sex differences in behaviour affect the collision risk from planned and operational wind farms within their foraging range and assess the likely consequences for long-term population viability. Both sexes made shorter trips during chick-rearing than prior to chick-hatching, spent a greater proportion of time within wind farm sites and had an eight times greater potential collision risk during chick-rearing. Females made longer trips than males at both these times of year, flew higher and spent more time within wind farm sites, leading to three times greater collision risk for females. After accounting for the potential additional mortality from collisions, and assuming that the death of a parent also led to the loss of its offspring, the breeding population was projected to increase by 3.57% (95% CI: 2.16-5.15%) per year, compared with 6.56% (95% CI: 4.59-8.73%) in the absence of turbines, suggesting a negligible effect on population viability.

In contrast, offshore wind turbines placed on rocky reefs in highly exposed areas are much less common and the impacts on local flora and fauna can only be hypothesized. On the Western coast of Norway, a rocky reef with a highly complex topography has been chosen to be the first full-scale offshore wind farm in the country. Underwater video analyses and multibeam bathymetry data with a generalized linear model were used opportunistically to investigate the influence of geomorphic explanatory variables on the occurrence of selected taxa (algae, sea urchins and sea stars) identified in the study area. Combining video observations and multibeam bathymetry in a generalized linear model revealed that the geomorphic descriptors: aspect, slope, rugosity, and benthic position indexes (BPI), were of significance for algae, sea urchins and sea stars at Havsul and served in showing their habitat preferences. Kelp occurred in areas of high rugosity, on gentle slopes, at elevated areas with a southerly orientation and on the sheltered side of rock or bedrock. Thus, construction disturbance that modify those variables may lead to a change in the area preferred by kelp. Turbines that shade southerly aspects may affect small kelp plants in reducing their available habitat. Sea urchins were more abundant on steep slopes and both sea stars and sea urchins showed a preference for a complex local relief (high rugosity) and heterogeneity in fine and broad elevation (shown by BPI). Thus, foundations and cable route preparation may significantly change the slope, rugosity of BPI broad, which will change the basis for sea urchin populations. It may likewise significantly change the rugosity or BPI (fine or broad), which may change the distribution of sea stars. The combination of video data and models using multibeam bathymetry yields useful information about the potential impacts of the construction of an offshore wind farm on rocky substratum and allows us to generate impact hypotheses that go beyond what could be hypothesized through a mere general knowledge of the area.

The purpose is to provide a realistic reference case study for research and practice in the emerging field of offshore wind energy. The soil data was obtained between 2005 and 2008 in an investigation program involving field measurements and laboratory experiments. The characterisation focuses on soil properties which are relevant for evaluating the performance of foundations for offshore wind turbines. The soil profile at the Sheringham Shoal site consists of four main units: two clay strata interbedded with a sand layer and underlain by a chalk bed. The heavily overconsolidated state of the clays and the densely compacted state of the sand dictate the behaviour of these soils. The chalk bed is characterised by varying degrees of weathering leading to significant variation in properties ranging from those typical for stiff soil to soft rock These four main units, though differ considerably in soil composition, share several common characteristics including high shear strength and high stiffness but their shear stiffnesses reduce significantly both at high mobilised static shear strength and at medium to high mobilised strength under cyclic loading. The soil stiffness is an important input parameter for the design of offshore wind turbine foundations and hence the degradation of stiffness is an important issue at this wind farm. A number of soil properties at the site show considerable variability which requires a specific foundation design tailored for each location in order to be both safe and cost-effective.

The most significant contribution in this context is made by the B-field component of the electromagnetic field (CMACS, 2005). A pilot study investigating the behaviour of the shore crab, Carcinus maenas, when exposed to B-fields simulating those in the vicinity of offshore wind farm sub-sea cables showed statistical significant changes in responses to key behavioural indicators. Building on these findings, this proposal is concerned with an integrated research project investigating the electromagnetic properties of offshore wind farm sub-sea cables and any impacts they may pose to commercially important crustacean species. Another important N. Sea fishery species is the plaice, Pleuronectes platessa, which spends up to 3 years of its life in coastal regions. This demersal (near bottom dwelling) species potentially may be affected by perturbation in magnetic fields caused by sub-sea cables. It has been shown that plaice transplanted to unfamiliar areas tended to orient towards their capture site giving support that this species uses the magnetic field of the Earth as a navigational tool (Metcalfe et al, 2006). The results of the proposed study may, therefore, have wider relevance to other commercially important species like the plaice. The study will focus on aspects that potentially threaten the utilisation of offshore wind farm energy which is considered an extremely important enabling technology in the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions (Rodmell & Johnson, 2005). The research will require the collaboration of electrical engineers (EE), marine biologists (MB), offshore engineers (OE) and neuroscientists (NS) from both the academic and industry sectors.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,NE/G524387/1,,,,,,,,Newcastle University,,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:15358499,,

If these exotic species were excluded from the analysis, platforms in proximity to each other generally tended to have invertebrate assemblages more similar to each other than to platforms located farther away. Spatial variation in barnacle recruitment onto ceramic plates and mussel growth rate reflected prevailing oceanographic gradients.

We developed movement models based on observed avoidance responses of common eider Somateria mollissima to wind farms to predict, and identify potential measures to reduce, impacts. Flight trajectory data that were collected post-construction of the Danish Nysted offshore wind farm were used to parameterize competing models of bird movements around turbines. The model most closely fitting the observed data incorporated individual variation in the minimum distance at which birds responded to the turbines. We show how such models can contribute to the spatial planning of wind farms by assessing their extent, turbine spacing and configurations on the probability of birds passing between the turbines.

Predator approaches and blenniid activity were compared in low and high surface current events. Results did not support a hypothesis of predation controlling the distribution and abundance of blennies.

However, despite the high numbers of fishes that can reside around offshore platforms, little is known about the comparative ecological performance of fishes living on platforms compared to those inhabiting natural habitats. It would be expected that sites where fishes exhibited better growth, increased reproduction, or greater survival rates would be beneficial to regional fish populations. We determined and compared the birthdate distributions and daily growth rates of 116 young-of-the-year (YOY) blue rockfish (Sebastes mystinus Jordan and Gilbert, 1881) among two platforms and two natural reefs in the Santa Barbara Channel region. We found a significant though modest lunar pattern in birthdates where blue rockfish produced (or successfully recruited) more larvae in the week leading up to the full moon. Mean growth rates were significantly different across sites. At one of the two site pairs (platform-natural reef), YOY rockfish growth rates were significantly higher at the platform habitat; there was no statistical difference in growth rates between fish living at the other site pair.

This may include partial removal (from the surface to 26 m depth) or complete removal of the platform structure. While complete removal would likely eliminate most of the existing fish biomass and associated secondary production, we find that the potential impacts of partial removal would likely be limited on all but one platform off the coast of California. On average 80% of fish biomass and 86% of secondary fish production would be retained after partial removal, with above 90% retention expected for both metrics on many platforms. Partial removal would likely result in the loss of fish biomass and production for species typically found residing in the shallow portions of the platform structure. However, these fishes generally represent a small proportion of the fishes associated with these platforms. More characteristic of platform fauna are the primarily deeper-dwelling rockfishes (genus Sebastes). Shell mounds are biogenic reefs that surround some of these platforms resulting from an accumulation of mollusk shells that have fallen from the shallow areas of the platforms mostly above the depth of partial removal. We found that shell mounds are moderately productive fish habitats, similar to or greater than natural rocky reefs in the region at comparable depths. The complexity and areal extent of these biogenic habitats, and the associated fish biomass and production, will likely be reduced after either partial or complete platform removal. Habitat augmentation by placing the partially removed platform superstructure or some other additional habitat enrichment material (e.g., rock boulders) on the seafloor adjacent to the base of partially removed platforms provides additional options to enhance fish production, potentially mitigating reductions in shell mound habitat.",,,,,,,,,42,0,0,0,28,0,43,,,1932-6203,,,,,,,,,,,"Occidental Coll, Dept Biol, Vantuna Res Grp, Los Angeles, CA 90041 USAUniv Calif Santa Barbara, Inst Marine Sci, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USABur Ocean Energy Management, Pacific Reg, Environm Sci Sect, Camarillo, CA USA",Bur Ocean Energy Management,,,2015-09-23,WOS:000360613800040,26332384,

In the optimization method, the decommissioning strategy means that the foundations can be reused after the retirement of the first generation of wind turbines, and then smaller second generation wind turbines will be installed on the original foundations. The optimization process is based on the Multi-Population Genetic Algorithm (MPGA). A conceptual two-dimensional (2D) wake model is adopted to calculate wind losses caused by wake effect. The Cost of Energy (COE) is regarded as the criteria to judge the effectiveness of this new method. The way to estimate costs will also be introduced in this study. Finally, a case study in Waglan sea area in Hong Kong is analyzed and discussed.

Multivariate model selection suggested that the decline was not related to the environmental factors considered, nor did it mirror wider population trends. Although cause and effect could not be unequivocally established, the theoretical basis of hearing in pinnipeds and previous studies suggested that extreme noise (to 257 dB re 1 mu Pa-pp @ 1 m) generated by pile-driving of turbine bases led to displacement of seals. A lack of full recovery of harbour seal during the study was also linked to their sensitivity to vessel activity and/or rapid colonisation of competing grey seal.

It may be assumed that offshore structures are generally free from the effects of earthquakes. However, even floating structures can be subjected to serious shock by earthquake induced waves which propagate through sea water. This phenomenon is called seaquake, and caused by compressibility of the sea water. The effects of seaquakes acting on the float of offshore wind turbine have to be considered to ensure the safety in earthquakes which occur at the bottom of the sea. In this study, seaquake load acting on the float of wind turbine is simulated by using Boundary Element Method. Helmholtz equation which dominates compressible fluid is solved in the frequency domain. The calculation results in both 2-dimensional and 3-dimensional domains are compared to understand qualitative behavior of seaquake. After understanding the basic characteristics of seaquake loads, the load effects on TLP (Tension Leg Platform) type of offshore wind turbine are discussed.

Given the complexity of the marine environment, a method capable of accommodating spatio-temporal behaviour of specific species and their interrelation with other marine phenomena is an essential prerequisite for investigating whether or not there has been any measurable impact to date.This paper presents a method based on geostatistical simulation to assess whether pre- and post-construction collected bird count data suggest displacement of birds due to the wind farm. The method takes into account spatial autocorrelation in species abundance at various scales, pre- and post-construction differences in environmental conditions and in survey effort and design.We demonstrate that taking these factors into account influences the conclusions about a wind farm's impact on bird life. In particular, incorporating spatial autocorrelation in seabird numbers is an important factor in reducing the risk of wrongly identifying an effect of a wind farm on bird abundance.Synthesis and applications. The development of offshore wind farms is often in conflict with nature conservation interests. Environmental impact assessment and monitoring is essential to protect and manage the marine environment. The method described here will allow scarce data to be utilized effectively as a basis for well-informed environmental decisions.

The current design methodologies based on p-y curves [the American Petroleum Institute (API) method, for instance] have gained a confirmed recognition in designing slender monopiles, such as those used for supporting offshore gas and oil platforms. However, when applied to large-diameter monopiles, these regulation codes failed to properly address the behavior of these extremely stiff structures, which is why many researchers tried to enhance the p-y method performance by suggesting new p-y formulas incorporating monopile properties. The paper reviews the analytical formulas of the p-y curves adopted by the current offshore guidelines and documents in detail the limitations and the shortcomings inherent to their formulations. The latest versions of p-y curves proposed to improve the performance of the Winkler model were also given. To show how well the finite-element (FE) analysis predicts the lateral response of large-diameter monopiles under horizontal loading on one hand, and how inappropriate the models using p-y curves are in studying this crucial problem on the other hand, two Fortran computer programs were considered. The first program, a computer code called NAMPULAL, combines the FE vertical slices method (VSM) and the hyperbolic model to describe the behavior of cohesionless soils. The second program, called Winkler-ROWKSS, is written using the finite-differences method. In the latter, the original and the newly developed p-y curves were implemented. The comparative study was made by considering two case histories. The first case is a monopile embedded in a multilayer sandy soil, which serves as a support foundation to 5-MW National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) wind turbines, and the second case is a monopile supporting OWTs at Horns Rev in the Danish sector of the North Sea. At the first site, the evolution of the monopile head movements with applied loading provided by the different models of beams on nonlinear Winkler foundations (BNWFs) as well as the FEM was examined and compared. However, at the second site, only the monopile lateral displacement profile was studied.",,,,,,,,,23,2,0,0,0,0,24,,,1532-3641,1943-5622,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Saad Dahled Blida, Fac Technol, Dept Civil Engn, Route Soumaa, Blida 09000, Algeria",Univ Saad Dahled Blida,,,2018-09-28,WOS:000444669500002,,

The results were translated into a generalized impact assessment for coastal waters in Sweden, which covers a range of salinity conditions from marine to nearly fresh waters. Hence, the conclusions are potentially applicable to marine planning situations in various aquatic ecosystems. The assessment considered impact with respect to temporal and spatial extent of the pressure, effect within each ecosystem component, and level of certainty. Research on the environmental effects of offshore wind farms has gone through a rapid maturation and learning process, with the bulk of knowledge being developed within the past ten years. The studies showed a high level of consensus with respect to the construction phase, indicating that potential impacts on marine life should be carefully considered in marine spatial planning. Potential impacts during the operational phase were more locally variable, and could be either negative or positive depending on biological conditions as well as prevailing management goals.

The results indicate that ocean beliefs and underlying values have direct and indirect associations with expectations and support for an offshore wind energy project development.

We applied the TSRS approach to the northern Gulf of Mexico using about 26,000 moderate resolution optical/SAR images from eight satellites spanning the period from 1982 to 2017. TSRS detected a total of 9260 (5556) platforms in both Federal and State waters, including 3140 (1803) existing platforms, 5044 (3426) removed platforms, and 1076 (327) status-to-be-determined platforms where the numbers in parentheses represent those from Federal waters. Of these TSRS platforms, 4751 coincide spatially with 5476 (77.68%) of platform records of the Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement (BSEE) platform database; 2846 (387 in Federal waters) are not found in the BSEE platform database but are convincingly supported by data from other sources (including BSEE-pipeline-database, time-series VIIRS nighttime light products, and littoral ground truth images), meaning that 82.04% of the TSRS-derived platforms can be directly/indirectly confirmed. A site specific validation in East Bay using multi-temporal ground-truth aerial images indicates that, for this site, the false negative rate (FNR) is similar to 9.63% and the false positive rate (FPR) is only 4.44%. The detailed beginning/end dates of the TSRS platforms are mostly confirmed by the corresponding Installation/Site-clear dates recorded in the BSEE platform database. Our findings suggest that the TSRS approach is a robust and cost-effective way to assess oil/gas platform status in large regions, and our results here may complement the official database, narrow down locations for future field investigations, and provide critical information for future assessment of the potential impacts of active and decommissioned platforms on the marine environments.",,,,,,,,,30,0,0,0,7,0,30,,,0034-4257,1879-0704,,,,,,,,,,"Nanjing Univ, Dept Geog Informat Sci, Nanjing 210023, Jiangsu, Peoples R ChinaUniv S Florida, Coll Marine Sci, St Petersburg, FL 33701 USANanjing Univ, Int Inst Earth Syst Sci, Nanjing 210023, Jiangsu, Peoples R ChinaJiangsu Ctr Collaborat Innovat Geog Informat Reso, Nanjing 210023, Jiangsu, Peoples R ChinaNanjing Univ, Collaborat Innovat Ctr South China Sea Studies, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R ChinaNanjing Univ, Nanjing 210023, Jiangsu, Peoples R ChinaUniv S Florida, St Petersburg, FL 33701 USA",Jiangsu Ctr Collaborat Innovat Geog Informat Reso,,,2018-04-10,WOS:000428498400005,,

Artificial hard substrate, such as that associated with oil and gas platforms, provides settlement opportunities for species adapted to hard substrates in areas of soft sediment. The contribution of artificial hard substrate and the consequences of its removal (e.g. through decommissioning) to marine connectivity is not clear, yet such information is vital to inform marine spatial planning and future policy decisions on the use and protection of marine resources. This study demonstrates the application of a social network analysis approach to quantify and describe the ecological connectivity, informed by particle tracking model outputs, of hard substrate marine communities in the North Sea. Through comparison of networks with and without artificial hard substrate, and based on hypothetical decommissioning scenarios, this study provides insight into the contribution of artificial hard substrate, and the consequence of decommissioning, to the structure and function of marine community connectivity. This study highlights that artificial hard substrate, despite providing only a small proportion of the total area of hard substrate, increases the geographic extent and connectivity of the hard substrate network, bridging gaps, thereby providing 'stepping stones' between otherwise disconnected areas of natural hard substrate. Compared to the baseline scenario, a decommissioning scenario with full removal of oil and gas platforms results in a nearly 60% reduction in connectivity. Such reduction in connectivity may have negative implications for species' distribution, gene flow and resilience following disturbance or exploitation of marine hard substrate communities. Synthesis and applications. Social network analysis can provide valuable insight into connectivity between marine communities and enable the evaluation of impacts associated with changes to the marine environment. Providing standardized, transparent and robust outputs, such a tool is useful to facilitate understanding across different disciplines, including marine science, marine spatial planning and marine policy. Social network analysis therefore has great potential to address current knowledge gaps with respect to marine connectivity and crucially facilitate assessment of the impacts of changes in offshore substrate as part of the marine spatial planning process, thereby informing policy and marine management decisions.",,,,,,,,,16,0,0,0,6,0,16,,,0021-8901,1365-2664,,,,,,,,,,"CEFAS, Weymouth Lab, Weymouth, EnglandNIOZ Royal Netherlands Inst Sea Res, Dept Coastal Syst, Den Burg, NetherlandsUniv Utrecht, Den Burg, NetherlandsCEFAS, Lowestoft Lab, Lowestoft, Suffolk, EnglandUniv East Anglia, Norwich Res Pk, Sch Environm Sci, Norwich, England",,,,2020-01-24,WOS:000507069800001,,

[2], [3] (in their reliability database), are identified and analysed more in details.Dataset organisationThe dataset is organised in an Excel worksheet, consisting of:sheet 1 - LegendAcronyms and colour coded legend are explained. Additionally the following acronyms are used in the Excel work and throughout this introduction:- WT(s) = Wind Turbine(s)- WF(s) = Wind Farm(s)sheet 2 - EU WFsData from Zhang et al. [1] have been verified and updated by accessing the main information of the wind farms (see link in reference in the section). In particular, for each project, the following information are reported: - WF name, capacity and country - number of WTs - WTs manufacturer/type - type of control, gearbox, generator, and converter - year when WF was online - average distance from shore - current status of the WFsheet 3 - EU WFs (Fully-Grid Connected)The fully-grid connected, and still in operation, wind farms are selected out of the ones listed in sheet 1. In the main table (Range(A1:N83)), the WTs are identified in the four drivetrain types (and type D sub-types), defined by Perez et al. [4] (N2:N83). A table reporting the acronyms for the if cycle on the WT characteristics (speed, gearbox and generator) is reported in cells Range(AH2:AL11).Based on this latter, cells in Range(Q1:AD84) contain if cycles for identifying the share of each drivetrain type on the total installed capacity. The results are plotted in a pie chart, gathering type A and B. Finally, the table in Range(AS1:CA86) wants to verify how much of the actual installed (fully-grid connected) capacity is accounted in this dataset. WindEurope report on offshore wind energy statistics, to the end of 2017 [5], is used as a reference, and the sharing to the total capacity of the several manufacturers and of the top 5 countries and is checked.sheet 4 - Strath.

In total, 336 dab were analysed from five sampling areas in the North Sea, including the German Bight, the Dogger Bank, the Firth of Forth, and two locations close to oil and gas platforms (Ekofisk and Danfield). When considering plasma lysozyme levels, pinocytosis and respiratory burst activity of head kidney leucocytes, a clear gradient could be observed with decreased levels in individuals collected from the Firth of Forth and locations near the oil or gas platforms compared with dab from the Dogger Bank or the German Bight. Individuals with induced EROD activity displayed reduced lysozyme and respiratory burst activities. Lysozyme levels were also reduced in dab with lymphocystis or with nematodes. The data obtained indicate that the assessment of innate immune parameters in a monitoring programme provides supplementary information about immunomodulatory effects associated with the exposure of fish to contaminants.

It is possible that these structures form a system of interconnected reef environments through the planktonic dispersal of the pelagic stages of organisms by ocean currents. Changes to the overall arrangement of hard substrate areas through removal or addition of individual man-made structures will affect the interconnectivity and could impact on the ecosystem. Here, we assessed the connectivity of sectors with oil and gas structures, wind farms, wrecks, and natural hard substrate, using a model that simulates the drift of planktonic stages of seven organisms with sedentary adult stages associated with hard substrate, applied to the period 2001-2010.

Yet, the seabird guilds most likely at risk of cumulative effects have not been identified. Assessments of cumulative effects must first calculate the cumulative exposure of seabirds to areas suitable for offshore wind farms and then estimate how exposure will affect populations. This paper addresses this first need, and quantifies how three different wind farm siting scenarios could cumulatively expose seven seabird foraging guilds. The coastal bottom gleaner guild (sea ducks) would be exposed at similar rates regardless of siting decision, while other coastal guilds would be exposed at a higher rate when projects are built in shallow areas and close to shore rather than in high-wind areas. The pelagic seabird guild would be exposed at high rates when projects are built in high-wind areas. There was no single offshore wind siting scenario that reduced the cumulative exposure for all guilds. Based upon these findings, we identify the foraging guilds most likely to be cumulatively exposed and propose an approach for siting and mitigation that may reduce cumulative exposure for all guilds.",,,,,,,,,11,1,0,0,10,0,15,,,1748-9326,,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Massachusetts, Dept Environm Conservat, 210 Holdsworth Hall, Amherst, MA 01003 USABiodivers Res Inst, 276 Canco Rd, Portland, ME 04103 USA",Biodivers Res Inst,,,2019-08-02,WOS:000475442000002,,

Exposure of northern gannet (Morus bassanus) to multiple wind farms could affect the population because gannets are vulnerable to both displacement and collision. A critical question is whether wind-farm siting decisions can reduce cumulative exposure of gannets. We quantified how 3 different wind-farm siting scenarios would cumulatively expose gannets. Two independent gannet abundance data sets were used to ensure robustness of the analysis: 1) individual tracking data from birds captured in the mid-Atlantic region of the United States from 2012-2015 and 2) relative abundance models developed by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration from surveys conducted from 1978-2014 along the Atlantic Coast of the United States. Our results indicate that for initial development, projects sited close to shore and in shallow areas exposed gannets at the greatest rates; however, no siting scenario effectively avoided exposing gannets because of the birds' broad distribution across the outer continental shelf. These findings suggest that gannets will be cumulatively exposed regardless of siting scenario and management actions should focus on efforts to minimize adverse effects at each wind farm rather than avoiding exposure through siting decisions.

Coastal erosion due to this type of facility is then examined. The main conclusion of this article is that, whilst there are certain opinions claiming the coast is not affected by the presence of this kind of facility since the distance from location to coast and between wind turbine generators themselves is long, the impact must be analysed in each specific case, at least until experience proves otherwise and criteria are adopted in this respect.",,,,,11th International Coastal Symposium (ICS)11th International Coastal Symposium (ICS),"MAY 09-13, 2011MAY 09-13, 2011","Univ Szczecin, Inst Marine & Coastal Sci; Coastal Educ & Res Fdn; Univ Szczecinski (US); Cztowiek Nauka Srodowisko (CNS); ZMGM; Reg Dyrekcja Ochrony Srodowiska; Esri; Springer; Lotos; GA2 Syst; World Sci; Helmholtz-Zentrum Geesthacht; Nfosigm; Urzad Marszalkowski Wojewodztwa Zachodniopomorskiego; Wojewodzki Fundusz Ochrony Srodowiska I Gospodarki Wodnej W GdanskuUniv Szczecin, Inst Marine & Coastal Sci; Coastal Educ & Res Fdn; Univ Szczecinski (US); Cztowiek Nauka Srodowisko (CNS); ZMGM; Reg Dyrekcja Ochrony Srodowiska; Esri; Springer; Lotos; GA2 Syst; World Sci; Helmholtz-Zentrum Geesthacht; Nfosigm; Urzad Marszalkowski Wojewodztwa Zachodniopomorskiego; Wojewodzki Fundusz Ochrony Srodowiska I Gospodarki Wodnej W Gdansku","Szczecin, POLANDSzczecin, POLAND",13,0,0,0,3,0,13,,,0749-0208,1551-5036,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Politecn Madrid, Res Grp Marine Coastal & Port Environm & Other Se, E-28040 Madrid, Spain",,,,2012-05-23,WOS:000302824900134,,

Since no study has examined the distribution of bottlenose dolphins relative to gas platforms, when dolphins were encountered, their distance from the nearest gas platform was estimated and behaviour was assessed. Dolphins were sighted on ca. 36% of survey trips, which varied in duration from 1 to 6h. Group size ranged from 1 to 50 individuals, with no seasonal trend evident in the likelihood of encounter. Dolphin density was estimated to be approximately 80% higher within 750m of gas platforms, relative to densities >750m from platforms, although variability around the estimates was high. From a limited number of behavioural observations, slightly higher frequencies of feeding and milling behaviour were observed closer to gas platforms, whereas dolphins observed further away exhibited higher frequencies of socialising and travelling.

While bats have been observed inside offshore wind farms, their activity at turbine rotor height yet remains unknown. We therefore installed acoustic bat detectors at wind turbines in the Belgian part of the North Sea. Seven detectors were installed on the service platform of the transition piece (16 m above mean sea level) and four were installed on the nacelle of the turbines, in the centre of the rotor swept area (93 m above mean sea level). A total of 151 recordings of call sequences of Pipistrellus nathusii (Nathusius' pipistrelle) were made during 20 nights over an entire autumn migration season (8 August - 30 November 2017). 45 recordings contained more than 10 calls. These were further investigated for behavioural clues. We identified 32 recordings of animals in transit and 10 sequences of animals passing by while simultaneously exploring. Only three detections contained feeding buzzes and/or intense exploratory behaviour. The number of recordings at 93 m were around 10% of the number of recordings made at 16 m. This indicates that the activity of P. nathusii at our study site, measured at that particular altitude is low. Our observations therefore suggest that the collision risk might be lower than what could be expected from low altitude observations.

Both methods recorded a similar number of fish species although with only eight species in common, thus supplying complementary information and a good estimate of the total fish species richness (39) associated with these gas platforms.

Identifying effective conservation strategies, in order to manage or mitigate the negative impacts of human activities, requires a way to first identify and evaluate the impact of activities on ecosystem components. Multicriteria decision analysis (MCDA) techniques such as the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) offer a way to systematically evaluate and integrate stakeholder opinion in order to set priorities and make decisions. With a goal to synthesize current knowledge of the potential impacts of human activity on breeding and non-breeding seabirds in the western North Atlantic Ocean, we present a case study involving the use of AHP to assess sensitivity of species to such hazards as: fisheries bycatch, oiling, light pollution, vessel traffic, marine debris, and offshore wind turbines. Based on responses from ten North Atlantic seabird experts, fisheries bycatch (particularly when involving suspended gill nets) was identified as the greatest risk across a wide range of species, with an overall relative value of 0.47 +/- SE 0.026. Oiling risk was the second most highly ranked (0.26 +/- 0.026, of which 0.214 corresponded with surface oil, 0.044 with oil and gas platform interactions), and was considered to have the greatest potential impact on alcids (Common and Thick-billed Murre, Atlantic Puffin, Razorbill, Dovekie). Offshore wind turbines (0.097 +/- 0.022), marine debris (0.08 +/- 0.016), light pollution (0.058 +/- 0.0077), and traffic (0.042 +/- 0.0053) were considered to be less serious risks for seabirds than fisheries bycatch and oiling.

Based on a survey of local residents, we first identify current CES in the sea and the intangible values associated with them. Seascape and place emerge as useful conceptual bridges linking ecosystem functioning outcomes to key CES values. We then relate this to offshore wind farming, which some residents perceive as a significant threat to certain CES.

While limited, studies discuss local OWF (i.e., within the OWF footprint) impacts on fishes due to sediment resuspension or sedimentation, temperature change, nutrient transport, and substrate availability. These studies largely neglect possible effects further afield and generally conclude that any hydrodynamic impact of OW Fs on fishes cannot be distinguished when compared to natural variability. To further understanding of the cumulative risk from extensive OWF developments requires additional research on OWF-related spillover effects on surrounding ecosystems and on natural oceanographic connectivity.

To examine habitat use and potential mortality from explosive platform removals, fine-scale movements of red snapper were estimated based on acoustic telemetry from March 2017 to July 2018. Study sites in the northern Gulf of Mexico, USA, included one platform off coastal Alabama (30.09 degrees N, 87.88 degrees W) and 2 platforms off Louisiana (28.81 degrees N, 91.97 degrees W; 28.92 degrees N, 93.15 degrees W). Red snapper (n = 59) showed a high affinity for platforms, with most (94%) positions being recorded within 95 m of the platforms. Home range areas were correlated with water temperature and inversely correlated with dissolved oxygen concentrations. During summer and fall, red snapper used larger areas and many fish (54%) emigrated from their platforms but most (83%) returned in <= 3 d. Site fidelity for red snapper was 31% yr(-1) and residency time was 7 mo, but the probability-of-presence at platforms was 70% after 1 yr, indicating the importance of platforms for this species. Overall fishing mortality was high for platforms (F = 0.86, 95% CL = 0.47-1.40), but since the stock is managed on a quota basis this high mortality should have little effect on total stock abundance. Thus, platforms can still provide an important habitat for red snapper, and consideration of area use patterns, fishing mortality and environmental factors can reduce red snapper mortality when scheduling explosive platform removals. As such, the present study indicates that an optimum time for explosive removal would be in late summer after the red snapper fishing season is completed.",,,,,,,,,13,0,0,0,11,0,15,,,0171-8630,1616-1599,,,,,,,,,,"Auburn Univ, Sch Fisheries Aquaculture & Aquat Sci, 8300 Slate Hwy 104, Fairhope, AL 36532 USALGL Ecol Res Associates Inc, Bryant, TX 77802 USA",LGL Ecol Res Associates Inc,,,2021-03-02,WOS:000621226100011,,

Expert judgement is used to link these impacts to changes in vital rates and applied to population models that compare population changes under baseline and construction scenarios over a 25 year period.

In contrast, on far offshore and strictly subtidal locations, such as shipwrecks and rocky reefs, only C. linearis was found. Based on these exploratory observations, we hypothesised that artificial structures that are only subtidal are inhabited exclusively by C. linearis, and never by C. mutica. To test this hypothesis and understand factors driving each species habitat preferences, habitat suitability models were constructed using generalised additive models, based on samples collected in 2013-2015 from offshore gas platforms, buoys, shipwrecks, and rocky reefs and combined with data from other published and unpublished surveys (2001-2014). The models showed that the presence of C. mutica is explained by the availability of intertidal and floating hard substrates, suspended particulate matter density (SPM), mean annual sea surface temperature, salinity, and current velocity. The C. linearis model included subtidal hard substrates, SPM, salinity, temperature, and current velocity. The modelled distributions showed a significant difference, demonstrating that C. linearis habitat preference does not fully overlap with that of C. mutica. Thus, the native and alien Caprella species are likely to be able to co-exist in the North Sea. DATASETCSV containing raw sampling data including date and position, among others.

An improved understanding of the economic, social and environmental impacts of this sector, and how they compare with those of other energy systems, is therefore necessary to support energy policy and planning decisions. The ecosystem services approach provides a more holistic perspective of socio-ecological systems than traditional environmental impact assessment. The approach also makes possible comparisons across disparate ecological communities because it considers the societal implications of ecological impacts rather than remaining focused on specific species or habitats. By reporting outcomes in societal terms, the approach also facilitates communication with decision makers and the evaluation of trade-offs. The impacts of offshore wind development on ecosystem services were assessed through a qualitative process of mapping the ecological and cultural parameters evaluated in 78 empirical studies onto the Common International Classification for Ecosystem Services (CICES) framework. The research demonstrates that a wide range of biophysical variables can be consistently mapped onto the CICES hierarchy, supporting development of the ecosystem service approach from a broad concept into an operational tool for impact assessment. However, to improve confidence in the outcomes, there remains a need for direct measurement of the impacts of offshore wind farms on ecosystem services and for standardised definitions of the assumptions made in linking ecological and cultural change to ecosystem service impacts. The process showed that offshore wind farms have mixed impacts across different ecosystem services, with negative effects on the seascape and the spread of non-native species, and positive effects on Commercial fish and shellfish, potentially of most significance. The work also highlighted the need for a better understanding of long term and population level effects of offshore wind farms on species and habitats, and how these are placed in the context of other pressures on the marine environment.",,,,,,,,,38,0,0,0,9,0,40,,,1364-0321,,,,,,,,,,,"Plymouth Marine Lab, Prospect Pl, Plymouth PL1 3DH, Devon, England",,,,2017-04-01,WOS:000396184900021,,

We used fishery-independent vertical line surveys to evaluate whether gear efficiency and selectivity is similar while assessing reef fish populations at oil and gas platforms, artificial reefs, and natural banks in the western Gulf of Mexico. We conducted 192 vertical line sets with cameras placed on a subset of these deployments to validate any differences in efficiency among habitat types. Red snapper (Lutjanus campechanus) accounted for 93% of the catch. No difference in red snapper CPUE among habitats was detected. When evaluating fish size, 8/0 and 11/0 hooks sampled significantly larger red snapper at natural banks than at artificial habitats. While CPUE was similar among all hooks at artificial habitats, CPUE at natural banks was lower for shallower hooks and increased towards the bottom hooks along the backbone. At all habitats, red snapper TL decreased from shallow to deep hook positions. Simultaneous camera deployments revealed other processes affecting efficiency such as bait removal and depredation. Vermilion snapper (Rhomboplites aurorubens) were effective at removing bait while avoiding capture. Perhaps related to this observation, Red snapper CPUE was negatively correlated with the vermilion snapper video index of abundance. Video confirmed gear saturation was prevalent (70% of deployments), occurring more frequently on artificial habitats. Furthermore, the time fished was effectively shorter at artificial habitats as the number of available baited hooks declined rapidly. These results point towards higher relative abundance at artificial habitats; however, the prevalence of saturation indicates vertical line CPUE may not always be proportional to true abundance, hindering our ability to detect differences at the scale examined in this study. Vertical line surveys should evaluate the prevalence of saturation as inferences regarding relative abundance may be compromised when this information is unknown.",,,,,,,,,16,1,0,0,15,0,17,,,0165-7836,1872-6763,,,,,,,,,,"Texas A&M Univ Corpus Christi, Harte Res Inst Gulf Mexico Studies, 6300 Ocean Dr,Unit 5869, Corpus Christi, TX 78412 USAFlorida Atlantic Univ, Harbor Branch Oceanog Inst, 5600 US 1 North, Ft Pierce, FL 34946 USA",,,,2018-12-28,WOS:000432768000003,,

A System Dynamics (SD) model has been built and corrected iteratively with the participants through the GMB process. The diverse interests within the group led the process toward the design of multifunctional wind-farms with different modalities. The scenario analyses, using the SD model under various policies, including no wind-farm policy, objectively articulates the vision of the local stakeholders. The results of the SD simulations show that the multifunctional wind-farms may have superior economic effects and the larger wind-farms with bird corridors could reduce ecological impact.

In the UK there are statutory needs to monitor seabirds at sea, particularly in light of new offshore areas being designated for conservation and plans for major offshore wind farm developments. However, the extent to which at-sea surveys are capable of detecting changes in abundance and options for improving survey protocols have received little attention. We investigate the power of detecting changes in numbers using at-sea surveys. Using data collected as part of a visual aerial seabird survey programme that covered areas of 'Round 2' offshore wind farm developments in UK waters, we quantify the variability and characterize the statistical properties of count data. By generating random datasets with the same properties as real data, we estimated the power of being able to detect various declines (50, 33, 25, 15 and 10%) and assessed the effects of survey duration and frequency and of spatial scale and variability in bird numbers. The results indicate that the survey design protocols used for the UK 'Round 2' offshore wind farm visual aerial seabird survey programme do not provide adequate means of detecting changes in numbers, even when declines are in excess of 50% and assumptions regarding certainty are relaxed to < 80%. Extending the duration, frequency and spatial extent of surveys would increase the probability of detecting changes, but not to a desirable level (e. g. > 0.8). The primary reason why there is a low probability of being able to detect consistent directional changes is that seabird numbers fluctuate greatly at any given location.

In order to perform a proper continuous monitoring during operation, a fast and reliable solution, applicable on an industrial scale, has been developed. It will be shown that the use of appropriate vibration measurement equipment together with state-of-the art operational modal analysis techniques can provide accurate estimates of natural frequencies, damping ratios, and mode shapes of offshore wind turbines. The identification methods have been automated and their reliability has been improved, so that the system can track small changes in the dynamic behavior of offshore wind turbines. The advanced modal analysis tools used in this application include the poly-reference least squares complex frequency-domain estimator, commercially known as PolyMAX, and the covariance-driven stochastic subspace identification method.

The results indicated that after OWF construction, detritus, phytoplankton, zooplankton, anchovies, and some benthic fish were positively impacted. The increased primary production and detritus resulted in the increased food supply for zooplankton, which made it possible for planktivorous species (particularly anchovies) to be fed. Consequently, the biomass and production of some benthic fish increased, which indicates a potential reef effect. Other groups with decreased biomasses and productions may have been negatively impacted by the OWFs.

Seaweed is considered a promising feedstock for food and feed that could be produced at offshore wind farms. Concerns about risks resulting in liability claims and insurance premiums are often seen as show-stoppers to multi-use at offshore wind farms. In this study, key environmental risks of seaweed cultivation at offshore wind farms, identified through literature review, are characterized based on stakeholder consultation. The current approach to risk governance is evaluated to assess how it can handle the uncertain, complex, and/or ambiguous risks of multi-use. It is concluded that current risk governance for multi-use is poorly equipped to deal with the systemic nature of risks. Risk governance should be a joint effort of governments and private regulators. It can improve if it is based on an adaptive framework for risk assessment that can deal with complex, systemic risks. Furthermore, it should be flexible and inclusive, i.e., open to new incoming information and stakeholder input, and taking into account and communicate about the different stakes and values of the various parties involved. The importance of communication and inclusion must be recognized, which promotes participation of concerned stakeholders.

Using a transdisciplinary research approach, an understanding of the rationalities and interests among the different involved stakeholder groups was explored. Offshore wind energy is high on the political agenda in Germany. The vast spatial requirements however inherit potential user conflicts with competing, and under current legislation excluded users such as fishermen. Solutions for combining sustainable uses of the same ocean space have thus seen increasing interest within the research community in Germany and in Europe over the past years. This paper was inspired by and presents the outcomes of a stakeholder analysis and in particular a stakeholder workshop. Central focus was placed on academics and private as well as public stakeholders engaged in current research efforts of combining offshore wind farms and aquaculture in the German North Sea. The paper identifies the overall acceptance of such a multi-use scenario in society, opportunities and constraints as perceived by the stakeholders, and key research gaps. The results confirm the assumption that there is a clear need, and also willingness on behalf of the policy makers and the research community, to find sustainable, resource- and space-efficient solutions for combined ocean use.

Offshore wind farms appear to be clean, and are supported by governments and NGOs as a way to reduce the use of conventional energy resources and thus decrease greenhouse gas emissions. However, developing infrastructure in marine areas can impact marine ecosystems. European directives ask offshore wind farm developers to carry out an Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) including a mitigation hierarchy, i.e. envisaging measures that would avoid, reduce, and if possible offset significant adverse effects on ecosystems and human activities. This paper reviews EIA reports from seven European countries and is focused on impacts on the open water marine environment. According to the reports, measures have been taken for avoiding and reducing impacts, so there should be no significant negative residual impacts and hence no need of offsets. But the mitigation hierarchy for ecological impacts seems to have been incompletely implemented, because it is unlikely that there are no significant residual impacts.

J,,,,,,,,,Debbie Russell,,EcoSTAR: Ecosystem level importance of STructures as Artificial Reefs,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Awarded Grant,Jun 28 2020,2020,"The North Sea is one of the most industrialised marine environments on the planet, with thousands of man-made structures (MMS) including oil and gas platforms, pipelines, subsea cable routes, and marine renewable energy installations. Much of the infrastructure relating to the oil and gas industry has been in place for decades and is coming to the end of its economic life. In contrast, the marine renewable energy industry is expanding with many windfarms planned for construction in the near future. Current legislation requires that MMS in the North Sea should be removed from the marine environment after their operational lifespan is complete. With the decline of the oil and gas sector, the UK decommissioning operation will cost around £50 billion, with almost half of the financial burden falling on the taxpayer. These forthcoming changes in the North Sea landscape may have a significant impact on marine life. There is mounting evidence that the effects of MMS on the local marine environment are complex, and depend on the age, type, and operational status of the MMS. Once installed, MMS can host artificial reefs supporting diverse communities of marine life. Further, the exclusion of shipping and fishing in the vicinity of many MMS may provide refuges for fish and predators such as sharks, seals or porpoises (de facto Marine Protected Areas). However, the true extent of the effects of MMS on the ecosystem are unclear. To ensure effective decision-making about removal and installation of such structures in the future, there is an urgent need to better understand the impact of MMS on the North Sea ecosystem.EcoSTAR (Ecosystem-level importance of STructures as Artificial Reefs) is a collaborative project combining the expertise of marine ecologists from the Sea Mammal Research Unit (SMRU) at the University of St Andrews and the Centre for Environment, Fisheries and Aquaculture Science (Cefas). EcoSTAR aims to fill in the key knowledge gaps on the impact of MMS across the entire marine ecosystem. This ecosystem-wide approach is critical to fully understand the breadth of possible interactions between MMS and marine species. To achieve this, EcoSTAR will measure impacts of MMS from the bottom of the food chain (the benthic community) all the way to the top (marine mammals). EcoSTAR will 1) improve our understanding of the importance of MMS as habitat for benthic communities such as mussels, anemones and starfish; 2) measure how MMS influence the distribution and movement patterns of marine mammals in the North Sea; 3) determine how many seals and porpoises forage at MMS, and how often, and estimate the associated benefits or costs of MMS to individual animals; and 4) estimate the consumption of fish by seals and porpoises feeding around MMS. Critically, the knowledge gained from this project will be combined with existing data and knowledge of fish, food webs and fisheries, to predict the impacts of MMS on the whole ecosystem using cutting-edge ecosystem models. This will allow the prediction of the impacts of removing old structures (such as oil and gas platforms) and installing new structures (including wind turbines) on the marine ecosystem and on commercial fisheries The findings of EcoSTAR will facilitate the development of environmentally sustainable management strategies for the North Sea as whole, and specifically with regard the addition and removal of MMS.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,NE/T010614/1,,,,,,,,University of St Andrews,,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:15405249,,

The detection distance to wind farms for 3 species of fish representing various hearing capabilities varies between 0.4 and 25 km at wind speeds of 8 to 13 m s(-1). The detection distance depends on the size and number of windmills, the hearing abilities of the fish, background noise level, wind speed, water depth and type of sea bottom. The noise from windmills may decrease the effective range for sound communication of fish; however, it is not known to what extent this decrease affects the behaviour and fitness of fish. Windmill noise does not have any destructive effects upon the hearing abilities of fish, even within distances of a few metres. It is estimated that fish are consistently scared away from windmills only at ranges shorter than about 4 m, and only at high wind speeds (higher than 13 m s(-1)). Thus, the acoustic impact of windmills on fish is restricted to masking communication and orientation signals rather than causing physiological damage or consistent avoidance reactions. These conclusions must be viewed with great caution, however, as the existing data are prone to large uncertainties.

For a water depth less than 20m, monopile and multi-pile substructures (tripod, pentapod) are applied widely in offshore wind farms. Some wind farms in China are located in high seismicity regions, thus, the earthquake load may become the dominant load for offshore wind turbines.This paper deals with the seismic behavior of an offshore wind turbine (OWT) consisting of the NREL 5MW baseline wind turbine, a pentapod substructure and a pile foundation of a real offshore wind turbine in China. A test model of the OWT is designed based on the hydro-elastic similarity. Test cases of different load combinations are performed with the environmental conditions generated by the Joint Earthquake, Wave and Current Simulation System and the Simple Wind Field Generation System at Dalian University of Technology, China, in order to investigate the structural dynamic responses under different load conditions. In the tests, a circular disk is used to model the rotor-nacelle system, and a force gauge is fixed at the center of the disk to measure the wind forces during the tests. A series of accelerometers are arranged along the model tower and the pentapod piles, and strain gauges glued on the substructure members are intended to measure the structural dynamic responses. A finite element model of the complete wind turbine is also established in order to compare the theoretical results with the test data.The hydro-elastic similarity is validated based on the comparison of the measured dynamic characteristics and the results of the prototype modal analysis. The numerical results agree well with the experimental data. Based on the comparisons of the results, the effect of the wind and sea loads on the structural responses subjected to seismic is demonstrated, especially the influence on the global response of the structure. It is seen that the effect of the combined seismic, wind, wave and current load conditions can not be simply superimposed. Hence the interaction effect in the seismic analysis should be considered when the wind, wave and current loads have a non-negligible effect.",,,,,"35th ASME International Conference on Ocean, Offshore and Arctic Engineering35th ASME International Conference on Ocean, Offshore and Arctic Engineering","JUN 19-24, 2016JUN 19-24, 2016","ASME, Ocean Offshore & Arctic Engn DivASME, Ocean Offshore & Arctic Engn Div","Busan, SOUTH KOREABusan, SOUTH KOREA",1,0,0,0,0,0,1,,,,,978-0-7918-4997-2,,,,,,,,,"Dalian Univ Technol, Fac Infrastruct Engn, State Key Lab Costal & Offshore Engn, Dalian, Peoples R ChinaNorwegian Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Marine Technol, Ctr Autonomous Marine Operat & Syst, Trondheim, NorwayPowerchina Huadong Engn Corp Ltd, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, Peoples R China",,,,2017-03-01,WOS:000393090900066,,

These effects were investigated for epibenthos, demersal fish, and benthopelagic fish in the Thorntonbank and Bligh Bank wind farms in the Belgian part of the North Sea. Inside the wind farms, several local and temporal effects were detected, including both temporary construction effects (e.g., decreased densities of dab, ophiuroids and dragonets) as refugium effects (e.g., the presence of relatively large plaice). At the wind farm edges, only few temporary effects were noted, but real edge effects due to changes in fisheries intensity or 'spillover' from the wind farms could not be shown. The observed effects were not consistent between both wind farms, which is not surprising, given the differences in epibenthos and fish communities, sandbank topography, fishing pressure, development stage of the wind farms, and the used foundation types.

Aerial seabird surveys are often conducted so that changes in abundance may be monitored. For example, large-scale offshore wind farms are proposed for UK waters, and surveys are currently being conducted to quantify numbers and distribution ahead of construction. 2. Technological advances mean that strip transect surveys may now be conducted, using digital methods. We address survey design and data analysis issues for such digital surveys, contrasting them with visual aerial line transect surveys. 3. We also explore the relative performances of the methods for estimating the size of a large aggregation of common scoters in Carmarthen Bay, Wales. We found that abundance estimates from two digital methods were closely comparable, while estimates from visual aerial surveys were appreciably lower. 4. Synthesis and applications. Efficient survey methods to quantify abundance and distribution of seabirds are needed, to assess change arising from climate change, or developments such as the construction of large-scale offshore wind farms. The traditional survey methods are visual surveys conducted along transects from ships or aircraft. Digital video and stills surveys can be conducted from aircraft flying sufficiently high to avoid disturbance, while still being able to detect and identify seabirds.

Concerns about risks resulting in liability claims and insurance premiums are often seen as show-stoppers to multi-use at offshore wind farms. In this study, key environmental risks of seaweed cultivation at offshore wind farms, identified through literature review, are characterized based on stakeholder consultation. The current approach to risk governance is evaluated to assess how it can handle the uncertain, complex, and/or ambiguous risks of multi-use. It is concluded that current risk governance for multi-use is poorly equipped to deal with the systemic nature of risks. Risk governance should be a joint effort of governments and private regulators. It can improve if it is based on an adaptive framework for risk assessment that can deal with complex, systemic risks. Furthermore, it should be flexible and inclusive, i.e., open to new incoming information and stakeholder input, and taking into account and communicate about the different stakes and values of the various parties involved.

Monitoring was carried out at both the turbine site and a control site in 2005, 2006 and 2007. Harbour porpoises occurred regularly around the turbine site in all years, but there was some evidence that porpoises did respond to disturbance from installation activities.

The ecological importance of platforms is the subject of debate, but little information exists on the extent to which fish feed on platform-dwelling benthic organisms. We used a camera array to characterize the frequency and duration of incidents in which Sheepshead Archosargus probatocephalus foraged on platform-dwelling benthic organisms. We also characterized abundances and distributions of select platform-dwelling benthic organisms (barnacles, blennies, and stone crabs). Sheepshead foraging was more strongly associated with dissolved oxygen (DO, mg/L; measured at each camera) and time to slack tide (high or low) than other biological (prey densities), physiochemical, locational, or temporal variables. The number of Sheepshead foraging incidents increased by 18.9incidents m( -2) h( -1) (95% confidence interval [CI]=4.6-33.3) when DO increased by 1.0mg/L; foraging incidents increased by 4.5incidents m( -2) h( -1) (95% CI=1.6-7.4) when time to slack tide increased by 1.0h.

The combination of a matrix table displaying the full range of potential displacement and mortality levels together with seasonal potential biological removal (PBR) assessments provides a tool that increases confidence in the conclusions of impact assessments. If unrealistic displacement levels arid/or mortality rates are required to equal or approach seasonal PBRs, this gives an indication of the likeliness of adverse impacts on the assessed population.

A typical example is the unique tradition of Sea Buffalos Working in the Oyster Field, which has been practiced for over a century in Fangyuan Township of Changhua County. The cultural landscape of buffalos and workers cultivating oyster fields has been recognized as a precious cultural heritage by both local and international parties. However, Fangyuan Township is facing a turning point due to the installation of offshore wind turbines. Development-promoting public agencies and the private sectors are both in need of a new vision of communities in which a viable combination of new, green-energy-based industries and traditional, culture-based industries is allowed to take shape. With that in mind, we reviewed several other localities' experience of green-energy development and its effect on the community. We also analyzed how traditional cultural properties have been incorporated into the tourism industry in Fangyuan Township while also investigating the potential impact of the development of offshore wind farms (OWF) on traditional oyster cultivation there. A series of interviews and meetings with key stakeholders were held to examine, from different points of view, the benefits offered to the community by OWF developers and governmental decision-makers.

At each platform, there is a large horizontal beam situated at or near the sea floor. In some instances, shells and sediment have buried this beam and in other instances it is partially or completely exposed. We found that fish species responded in various ways to the amount of exposure of the beam. A few species, such as blackeye goby (Rhinogobiops nicholsii), greenstriped rockfish (Sebastes elongatus), and pink seaperch (Zalembius rosaceus) tended to avoid the beam. However, many species that typically associate with natural rocky outcrops, such as bocaccio (S. paucispinis), cowcod (S. levis), copper (S. caurinus), greenblotched (S. rosenblatti), pinkrose (S. simulator) and vermilion (S. miniatus) rock-fishes, were found most often where the beam was exposed. In particular, a group of species (e.g., bocaccio, cowcod, blue (Sebastes mystinus), and vermilion rockfishes) called here the sheltering habitat guild, lived primarily where the beam was exposed and formed a crevice. This work demonstrates that the presence of sheltering sites is important in determining the species composition of man-made reefs and, likely, natural reefs.

Despite the demonstrated effectiveness of ROVs in studying reef fishes over natural hard-bottom and small artificial reefs, there has been little application of this technology to larger artificial structures (10s of m tall and wide), We explored the utility of ROVs in rapidly characterizing an assemblage of fishes associated with an artificial reef complex in the western Gulf of Mexico (26.9-28.2 degrees N; 95.5-97.0 degrees W) dominated by partially removed and toppled oil and gas platforms. This study reports on an efficient method to sample these structures, where we integrated depth-interval transect (DIT) and continuous roving transect (CRT) protocols to document fish distribution and community structure on 14 artificial reef sites. Consistent with previous hydroacoustic studies, south Texas artificial reefs exhibited a vertically heterogeneous distribution of fishes that varied with structure orientation. These reefs were dominated by economically important lutjanids and carangids, both of which presented sampling challenges due to their patchy distribution around these vast structures. The non-uniform distribution and mobility of these dominant taxa highlight the utility of adopting roving approaches to assess fish communities on these complex structures. We conclude our study with a discussion of important logistical challenges associated with micro-ROV surveys in deepwater habitats, and potential complementary approaches to assist documentation of demersal fishes inhabiting a persistently turbid bottom layer.

Both local marine ecology and political climate play a role in decommissioning offshore oil production platforms. Compared to the relatively supportive political climate in the Gulf of Mexico for rigs-to-reefs programs, conflicting social values among stakeholders in Southern California increases the need for understanding ecological impacts of various decommissioning alternatives (which range from total removal to allowing some or all of platform structure to remain in the ocean). Additional scientific needs in the decommissioning process include further assessment of platform habitat quality, estimation of regional impacts of decommissioning alternatives to marine populations, and determination of biological effects of any residual contaminants. The principal management need is a ranking of environmental priorities (e.g. species-of-interest and marine habitats). Because considerable numbers of economically important species reside near oil platforms, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Fisheries should consider the consequences of decommissioning alternatives in their overall management plans. Management strategies could include designating reefed platforms as marine protected areas. The overarching conclusion from both ecological and political perspectives is that decommissioning decisions should be made on a case-by-case basis. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

The number of offshore wind farms is rapidly increasing as they are a critical part of many countries' renewable energy strategies. Quantifying the likely impacts of these developments on wildlife is a fundamental part of the impact assessments required in many regions before permission for developments is granted. A key concern related to wind turbines is the risk of birds colliding with turbine blades. We present a novel method to generate species-specific flight height distributions which can be used to improve the assessment of collision risk by better reflecting the proportion of in-flight populations at risk of collision.2. Data describing the flight heights of birds from surveys of 32 potential offshore wind farm development sites were combined to estimate continuous distributions for 25 marine bird species. Observations of flying birds assigned to discrete height categories were treated as observations from independent multinomial distributions with a shared underlying continuous distribution. This analysis enables calculation of the uncertainty around the estimates of the proportion of the in-flight population at risk and consideration of different turbine designs.3. The mean r(2) for model fit across species was 085, and for seven of the species, good independent model validation (80% of independent observations within 95% confidence intervals) provides some confidence for use of the results at alternative sites.4. All species exhibited positively skewed flight height distributions.

At sea, obtaining such estimates visually is limited not only by weather conditions but, more importantly, because a high proportion of birds fly at night and at heights above the range of visual observation. We used vertical radar with automated bird-tracking software to overcome these limitations and obtain data on the magnitude, timing and altitude of local bird movements and seasonal migration measured continuously at a Dutch offshore wind farm. An estimated 1.6 million radar echoes representing individual birds or flocks were recorded crossing the wind farm annually at altitudes between 25 and 115m (the rotor-swept zone). The majority of these fluxes consisted of gull species during the day and migrating passerines at night. We demonstrate daily, monthly and seasonal patterns in fluxes at rotor heights and the influence of wind direction on flight intensity.

To gain first insights which effect these substantial changes in habitat structure and diversity might have on faunal stocks settling on hard substrata, we compared the mobile demersal megafauna associated with the common types of wind turbine foundations ('jacket', 'tripod' and 'monopile with scour protections of natural rock') in the southern German Bight, North Sea. Monopiles with scour protection were mostly colonized by typical reef fauna. They were inhabited by an average of about 5000 edible crabs Cancer pagurus (per foundation), which is more than twice as much as found at the foundation types without scour protection. Strong evidence was found that all three foundation types not only function as aggregation sites, but also as nursery grounds for C. pagurus. Assuming equal shares of the three foundation types in future wind farms, we project that about 27% of the local stock of C. pagurus might be produced on site. When, for example, comparing the existing fauna at 1000 ship wrecks and on the autochthonous soft substrate with those which probably will establish at the foundations of 5000 hypothetically realized wind turbines, it becomes clear that the German Bight in the future will provide new artificial reef habitats for another 320% crabs (C. pagurus) and 50% wrasse (Ctenolabrus rupestris) representing substrata-limited mobile demersal hard bottom species.

The UK, for example, has committed to reducing its carbon emissions by 80% by 2050. Suggested ways of reaching such a target are to increase dependency on offshore wind, offshore gas and nuclear. It is not clear, however, how the construction, operation and decommissioning of these energy systems will impact marine ecosystem services, i.e. the services obtained by people from the natural environment such as food provisioning, climate regulation and cultural inspiration. Research on ecosystem service impacts associated with offshore energy technologies is still in its infancy. The objective of this review is to bolster the evidence base by firstly, recording and describing the impacts of energy technologies at the marine ecosystems and human level in a consistent and transparent way; secondly, to translate these ecosystem and human impacts into ecosystem service impacts by using a framework to ensure consistency and comparability. The output of this process will be an objective synthesis of ecosystem service impacts comprehensive enough to cover different types of energy under the same analysis and to assist in informing how the provision of ecosystem services will change under different energy provisioning scenarios.Methods: Relevant studies will be sourced using publication databases and selected using a set of selection criteria including the identification of: (i) relevant subject populations such as marine and coastal species, marine habitat types and the general public; (ii) relevant exposure types including offshore wind farms, offshore oil and gas platforms and offshore structures connected with nuclear; (iii) relevant outcomes including changes in species structure and diversity; changes in benthic, demersal and pelagic habitats; and changes in cultural services.

In addition to the extensive development of wind power on land, currently several European countries have offshore wind farms (OWFs) in operation, as well as proposals to build many more. Considering that seabirds spend more than 90% of their life at sea, it is clear that they may interact with these man-made structures. To date, information on how to measure the impact of OWFs on seabirds is very scarce. In many cases it comes from non-peer reviewed reports made for specific assessment studies, very often carried out without appropriate standard methodologies, that raise questions regarding the level of confidence that they merit. In this paper, we describe the current political framework concerning the possible development of OWFs in Spain. Based on this, we comment on both the relevant variables necessary to assess the impacts of OWFs on birds and the methodologies available to collect those variables in the field, discussing the strengths and weaknesses of each method. We show the importance of collision risk models, vulnerability indexes, cumulative impact assessment and population viability analysis as management tools. Mitigation measures that have the potential to minimise impacts are also summarised.

Wind turbines are multi-physical machines with significant interaction between their subcomponents. This paper will exploit this and present the possibility of identifying and tracking consistently the structural vibration modes of the drivetrain of the instrumented offshore wind turbine by using signals (e.g. acceleration responses) measured on the drivetrain system.

The microplastics in the samples might originate from garments or ropes via wastewater discharge. The abundance of plastic in the water and sediment samples collected from the wind farm area was lower than that in the samples collected from outside the wind farm area. The anthropogenic hydrodynamic effect was the main factor affecting the local distribution of microplastics. The presence of a wind farm could increase the bed shear stress during ebb tide, disturbing the bed sediment, facilitating its initiation and transport, and ultimately increasing the ease of washing away the microplastics adhered to the sediment.

Since only a few studies of the effects on fish or fish communities have so far been made in this context, there are great gaps in the relevant scientific knowledge. The findings have moreover been confined to small installations, and are thus hardly transferable to the much larger projects that are now being proposed. One is thus reduced to leaning on indirect assessments of the possible effects. It may be assumed, on the basis of common biological knowledge, that the the following types of environmental disturbances could occur, and affect the fish community or certain fish species, during the construction and operation of the farms and their eventual dismantling - deterioration of water quality (by sediment or oil spills or through increased turbidity) - changes in habitats - noise and vibration - unusual light and reflections - electromagnetic fields from direct-current cables The three last mentioned physical disturbances act directly on the sense organs of fish and thus affects such vital functions as communication, spawning, migration, and foraging. There may also be synergistic effects, and in addition to the biological ones, some economic consequences in the way of bans on anchoring and fishing.

Key questions in this context are that of appropriate categories for assessing human well-being and how to link different determinants of human well-being to specific ecosystem services supplied in adjacent marine areas. This paper presents the results of a case study that links tangible and intangible ecosystem benefits to a range of material and immaterial factors constituting human well-being. Determinants of human well-being were defined and indicators selected to make these linkages traceable. Ecosystem services were assessed for the offshore environment along the west coast of Schleswig-Holstein, Germany, based on the assumption of strong future development of offshore wind farming and considering the environmental and socio-economic impacts of such developments on the coastal region. This paper illustrates some conceptual problems in linking ecosystem benefits to human well-being. Based on an economic analysis and a questionnaire survey, two examples are presented where an evidence-based link could be demonstrated between an ecosystem service impacted by offshore wind farming and change in human well-being.

In total 41 individuals of Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) were captured, tagged and released in 2010 and 2011 in the C-Power wind farm in the Belgian part of the North Sea, to study their movement behaviour and assess the impacts of offshore wind farms on their movement ecology. This dataset also includes the data of the synchronisation tags present in the study. To calculate exact 2D positions using acoustic telemetry, the time difference of arrival of signals at different receivers is used. Therefore sync tags are needed to account for clock drift in the receivers. Intensive exploitation of the marine environment by mankind can alter the natural habitat of marine organisms drastically. The addition of artificial hard substrates (e.g. offshore wind turbines) to soft-sediment sandy bottoms is a pervasive example of an anthropogenic habitat change. In this study, we assess the influence of offshore wind farms on the spatio-temporal movement ecology of Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua).

Therefore, one commonly adheres to the precautionary principle, which states that one shall take action to avoid potentially damaging impacts on marine ecosystems, even when full scientific certainty is lacking. We implement this principle by means of a statistical power analysis including spatial factors. Implementation is based on geostatistical simulations, accommodating for zero-inflation in species data. We investigate scenarios in which an impact assessment still has to be carried out. Our results show that the environmental conditions at the time of the survey is the most influential factor on power. This is followed by survey effort and species abundance in the reference situation. Spatial dependence in species numbers at local scales affects power, but its effect is smaller for the scenarios investigated. Our findings can be used to improve effectiveness of the economical investment for monitoring surveys. In addition, unnecessary extra survey effort, and related costs, can be avoided when spatial dependence in species abundance is present and no improvement on power is achieved.",,,,,,,,,8,0,0,0,7,2,9,,,1051-0761,1939-5582,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Twente, Dept Water Engn & Management, NL-7500 AE Enschede, NetherlandsUniv Twente, Fac Geoinformat Sci & Earth Observat ITC, NL-7500 AE Enschede, Netherlands",,,,2011-10-01,WOS:000296139200031,22073657,

From a spatial planning perspective, this has not been a straight-forward process, due to substantial spatial conflicts with the traditional users of the sea, especially with fisheries and protected areas. In this article, we examine the availability of offshore space for wind farm deployment, from a transnational perspective, while taking into account different options for the management of the maritime area through four scenarios. We applied a mixed-method approach, combining expert knowledge and document analysis with the spatial visualisation of existing and future maritime spatial claims. Our calculations clearly indicate a low availability of suitable locations for offshore wind in the proximity of the shore and in shallow waters, even when considering its multi-use with fisheries and protected areas. However, the areas within 100 km from shore and with a water depth above -120 m attract greater opportunities for both single use (only offshore wind farms) and multi-use (mainly with fisheries), from an integrated planning perspective. On the other hand, the decrease of energy targets combined with sectoral planning result in clear limitations to suitable areas for offshore wind farms, indicating the necessity to consider areas with a water depth below -120 m and further than 100 km from shore. Therefore, despite the increased costs of maintenance and design adaptation, the multi-use of space can be a solution for more sustainable, stakeholder-engaged and cost-effective options in the energy deployment process.

In this paper, the number of collision victims at Belgian offshore wind farms was estimated with a (theoretical) collision risk model based on technical turbine specifications, bird-related parameters and bird density data of both local seabirds and passerine migrants. Bird density data were gathered by visual censuses and radar registrations. The outcome of the model was extrapolated to future development scenarios in the Belgian part of the North Sea and in the entire North Sea, and then further used for a preliminary assessment of the impact at population level for the species at risk. The results indicate that the cumulative impact of a realistic scenario of 10,000 turbines in the North Sea might have a significant negative effect at population level for lesser and great black-backed gull. We further show that during a single night of intense songbird migration, the number of collision victims among passerine migrants might be in the order of magnitude of several thousands in the entire North Sea.

These habitats can consist of a variety of materials, but in this region are primarily comprised of active and reefed oil and gas platforms. Despite being established for several decades, the fish communities inhabiting these structures remain poorly investigated. Between 2012 and 2013 we assessed fish communities at 15 sites using remotely operated vehicles (ROVs). Fish assemblages were quantified from standing platforms and an array of artificial reef types (Liberty Ships and partially removed or toppled platforms) distributed over the Texas continental shelf. The depth gradient covered by the surveys (30-84 m) and variability in structure density and relief also permitted analyses of the effects of these characteristics on fish richness, diversity, and assemblage composition. ROVs captured a variety of species inhabiting these reefs from large transient piscivores to small herbivorous reef fishes. While structure type and relief were shown to influence species richness and community structure, major trends in species composition were largely explained by the bottom depth where these structures occurred. We observed a shift in fish communities and relatively high diversity at approximately 60 m bottom depth, confirming trends observed in previous studies of standing platforms. This depth was also correlated with some of the largest Red Snapper captured on supplementary vertical longline surveys. Our work indicates that managers of artificial reefing programs (e.g., Rigs-to-Reefs) in the GOM should carefully consider the ambient environmental conditions when designing reef sites. For the Texas continental shelf, reefing materials at a 50-60 m bottom depth can serve a dual purpose of enhancing diving experiences and providing the best potential habitat for relatively large Red Snapper.",,,,,,,,,96,5,0,0,79,0,115,,,1932-6203,,,,,,,,,,,"Texas A&M Univ, Harte Res Inst Gulf Mexico Studies, Corpus Christi, TX USATexas Parks & Wildlife Dept, Artificial Reef Program, Austin, TX 78744 USA",Texas Parks & Wildlife Dept,,,2015-05-08,WOS:000356768100113,25954943,

These substrates are densely colonized by fouling organisms, which may compete for the available resources. While the distribution of some species is restricted to specific parts of the turbine, others occur across depth zones and may therefore face different competitive environments. Here we investigate the trophic niches of seven invertebrate species: three sessile (Diadumene cincta, Metridium senile, and Mytilus edulis), one hemi-sessile (Jassa herdmani) and three mobile species (Ophiothrix fragilis, Necora puber, and Pisidia longicornis) that occur in multiple depth zones. We hypothesized that these species would be trophic generalists, exhibiting trophic plasticity by selecting different resources in different depth zones, to cope with the different competitive environments in which they occur. We analyzed delta13C and delta15N of these species and their potential resources across depth zones. Our results show that most of these invertebrates are indeed trophic generalists which display substantial trophic plasticity, selecting different resources in different zones. Degree of trophic plasticity was not related to mobility of the species. There are two possible explanations for these dietary changes with depth: either consumers switch diet to avoid competition with other (dominant) species, or they benefit from the consumption of a non-limiting resource. Only Diadumene cincta was a trophic specialist that consumed suspended particulate organic matter (SPOM) independent of its zone of occurrence. Altogether, trophic plasticity appears an important mechanism for the co-existence of invertebrate species along the depth gradient of an offshore wind turbine.

Using Taylor's power law coupled with mixed effect models, the spatio-temporal variability of species' distributions can be synthesized in a measure of the aggregation levels of individuals over time and space. Applying the method to a seabird aerial survey in the Ebro Delta, NW Mediterranean Sea, we were able to make an explicit distinction between transitional and feeding areas to define and map the potential impacts of an offshore wind farm project. We use the Ebro Delta study case to discuss the advantages of potential impacts maps over density maps, as well as to illustrate how these potential impact maps can be applied to inform on concern levels, optimal EIA design and monitoring in the assessment of local offshore wind energy projects.

Morphological identification of macrofauna is time-consuming, expensive and dependent on taxonomic expertise. In this study, we evaluated the applicability of using foraminiferal-specific metabarcoding for routine monitoring. Sediment samples were collected along distance gradients from two oil platforms off Taranaki (New Zealand) and their physicochemical properties, foraminiferal environmental DNA/RNA, and macrofaunal composition analyzed. Macrofaunal and foraminiferal assemblages showed similar shifts along impact gradients, but responded differently to environmental perturbations. Macrofauna were affected by hypoxia, whereas sediment grain size appeared to drive shifts in foraminifera. We identified eight foraminiferal molecular operational taxonomic units that have potential to be used as bioindicator taxa. Our results show that metabarcoding represents an effective tool for assessing foraminiferal communities near offshore oil and gas platforms, and that it can be used to complement current monitoring techniques.

Observational studies are needed to improve understanding of faunal assemblages supported by offshore infrastructure and better predict the effect of removal. Here, we present results from visual inspection and physical sampling of a small oil and gas industry structure decommissioned from an oil field in the North East Atlantic. This is supported by observations of similar structures nearby and by photographs of the surrounding seabed from environmental baseline surveys. The structure supported a reasonably high biomass and diversity of invertebrates (>10 kg and >39 macrofaunal and 17 megafaunal species) and fishes (>20 kg biomass and >4 species). The invertebrate megafaunal species present on the structure were a sub-set of the hard substratum fauna observed on surrounding seabed. Porifera were absent from the structure. Biological succession in the first 2 years occurred as follows. Sparse colonies of the hydroid Obelia sp. stet were early colonisers then subsequent development of thick hydroid turf (Obelia sp. stet. and Halecium sp. stet.) supported an invertebrate assemblage (2654 individuals kg wet mass(-1)) dominated by saddle oysters [Pododesmus squama (Gmelin, 1791) and Heteranomia sp. stet.)] and scale worms (Harmothoe spp.). Percentage cover of hydroid turf varied significantly over the structure, with most growth on sections exposed to strongest currents. Commercially important fish species present around the structure included Gadus morhua (Atlantic cod), Pollachius virens (saithe) and Lophius piscatorius (monkfish). Studies of artificial structures such as this provide much needed data to understand their role in the ecology of seafloor habitats and inform environmental decision making on all stages of industry from exploration to decommissioning. We show that the ecological role of the decommissioned three-dimensional structures was to enhance the biomass of a sub-set of epifaunal invertebrates found in the area. This supported diverse associated macrofaunal organisms, providing a food source for motile invertebrates and fishes in an area where background hard substratum can be lost through the impacts of drilling.",,,,,,,,,14,0,0,0,9,0,14,,,,2296-7745,,,,,,,,,,"Natl Oceanog Ctr, Southampton, Hants, EnglandUniv Southampton, Ocean & Earth Sci, Southampton, Hants, EnglandBangor Univ, Sch Ocean Sci, Menai Bridge, Gwynedd, WalesMem Univ, Fisheries & Marine Inst, Sch Ocean Technol, St John, NF, Canada",,,,2019-11-22,WOS:000495729700001,,

Using a simulation approach, it was tested whether a TTS can still be induced under current protective regulations by multiple exposures. The evaluation tool presented here can be easily adjusted for different sound propagation, acoustic signals, or species and enables one to calculate a minimum deterrence distance.

In the present analysis, the additional constraints on wind farm siting of ecosystem services cost, in particular ecological and social services, are explored in an ecosystem-based management (EBM) conceptual framework. An ecological typology of the coastal area is developed on the basis of ecological variables, using spatial multivariate principal component and cluster analyses. Then, the sensitivity of the resulting ecological subregions to wind farm impact is assessed through the construction of ecological services impact indexes. A fishery service index is used to assess the fisheries services constraints. Ecosystem services constraints are combined with the technological cost and the wind resources to provide a wind farm siting index (WiFSI), which can be used as a tool to identify optimal areas for wind farm siting. In the paper, the authors develop the conceptual approach and present its application to the SAMP area as a case study. The technological cost is based on wind turbines with lattice jacket support structures, as currently proposed in Rhode Island waters, and the WiFSI method is used to identify optimal potential wind farm sites in coastal and offshore Rhode Island waters.

GPS tags were deployed on 12 breeding guillemots from Helgoland for 8-26 days during 2016-2017. Most individuals avoided the OWFs, but one individual in each year briefly entered the OWFs on two or three occasions. Using a point process model, we revealed a 63% reduction in the resource selection of the OWF areas compared with the surroundings (lower confidence interval (CI) = 79% reduction, upper CI = 36% reduction). Furthermore, OWF avoidance was increased to 75% when the turbine blades were rotating (lower CI = 93% reduction, upper CI = 11% reduction). Guillemots mainly approached the OWFs from their eastern edge when resting or diving, and rarely approached the areas when commuting. These results provide a detailed description of guillemot reactions to OWFs during the breeding season, and the first comprehensive analysis of OWF effects on this species based on telemetry data. The strong avoidance effect for guillemots during the breeding season indicates the need to consider the presence of OWFs when interpreting future trends in the abundance and breeding success of this species.",,,,,,,,,20,0,0,0,13,0,21,,,0025-3162,1432-1793,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Kiel, Res & Technol Ctr FTZ, Hafentorn 1, D-25761 Busum, GermanyBur Biostat BIONUM, Finkenwerder Norderdeich 15a, D-21129 Hamburg, Germany",Bur Biostat BIONUM,,,2020-07-26,WOS:000556611100004,,

In June 1993 and January 1994, genetic diversity of Harpacticoida (Copepoda) living proximal to operating, offshore platforms in the Gulf of Mexico was estimated to test if platforms are associated with strong selective pressures. Because harpacticoids have short generation times and direct benthic development, they are suitable organisms for examining population responses. Genetic diversity was estimated by comparing restriction fragment length polymorphisms generated from mitochondrial DNA amplified by the polymerase chain reaction on individuals of five species (Cletodes sp., Enhydrosoma pericoense, Normanella sp., Robertsonia sp., and Tachidiella sp.). Populations living at Near regions (stations < 50 m from a platform) had significantly less haplotype diversity than populations of the same species living at Far regions (stations > 3 km from a platform). The levels of haplotype diversity exhibited by the Far populations were similar at three different platforms located hundreds of kilometers apart. The differences in haplotype diversity between Near and Far regions were the result of a higher proportion of dominant haplotypes, and a loss of less common haplotypes. Haplotypic diversity was inversely correlated with a multivariate measurement of levels of sediment contaminants. The pattern of haplotype diversity on the Gulf of Mexico continental shelf seems to consist of a uniform level of haplotype diversity, punctuated by islands of lower diversity around oil and gas platforms. The selective pressures that lead to a loss of genetic diversity may be the result of contaminants, other differences in the physico-chemical environment, or disturbance in general.",,,,,,,,,42,1,0,0,17,0,43,,,0025-3162,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1996-08-01,WOS:A1996VH65800012,,

However, the erection of wind farms on the seabed may have considerable impacts on birds, namely local seabirds as well as waterbirds and terrestrial species that regularly cross the sea during migration or during foraging flights. There are two internationally important areas for seabirds and coastal birds off the German North Sea coast: the Eastern German Bight and the sea stretch seawards off the East Frisian Islands. Important areas along the Baltic coast comprise sea inlets in Mecklenburg-West Pomerania including the Szczecinski lagoon, Pomeranian Bay, as well as large parts of the Bight of Lubeck and Kiel Bay. Every year during migration, tens of millions of birds cross the North Sea and the Baltic Sea on their way from breeding grounds to wintering areas and back. Both seas are part of global flyway systems. The erection of wind facilities offshore can have the following adverse affects on birds: (1) risk of collision with wind turbines; (2) short-term habitat loss during construction; (3) long-term habitat loss due to disturbance by wind turbines including disturbances from sailing activities in connection with maintenance; (4) formation of barriers on migratory routes; and (5) disconnection of ecological units, such as roosting and feeding sites of local birds. To evaluate conflict potentials of individual parameters, we should know the distribution of birds at proposed wind plant locations and details of their behavior, in particular flight altitudes above sea level, perceptibility of wind turbines and species-specific sensitivities. To analyze the latter, elaborate behavioral investigations should be carried out on pilot wind power facilities. Methodological assessment standards and an assessment method for proposed wind farm sites are being developed within the scope of a project funded by the German Federal Environmental Agency. The environ- mental impact studies will comprise three major research complexes: (1) transect studies to analyze distribution and density of seabirds; (2) radar investigations; and (3) visual observations/flight call recordings to detect movements of passage migrants and foraging local birds. They should also include long-term comparative studies before and after installation of a wind farm as well as synchronous investigations in unaffected reference areas (BACI approach). Quality control regulations should be implemented. For a sound assessment of impacts of offshore wind farms on the marine environ- ment, it is vital that all potential construction sites are considered not individually, but as parts of an integral assessment framework, including their cable connections to the network on land, in the North Sea and the Baltic Sea respectively.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,0722-2947,,,,,,,,,,,"Institut fuer Vogelforschung Vogelwarte Helgoland, An der Vogelwarte 21, 26386 Wilhelmshaven, Germany",,,,2003-01-01,ZOOREC:ZOOR13900018175,,

We assessed coral recruitment on platforms possessing adult corals around the FGB. In this preliminary experiment, we used terra cotta plates mounted on racks, deployed on six platforms at depths of 15-27 m for a duration of <= 1 yr in two consecutive years. Data on coral spat taxonomic identification, distribution, and densities were collected. Platform spat densities on plates averaged <1/450 cm(2), a low value when compared with the East-FGB (E-FGB; data from earlier similar experiment), other Caribbean sites, or the Great Barrier Reef. Spat density was not significantly different between platforms, suggesting that distance between the platforms and the E-FGB, a potential larval source, was large enough (>0.6-1.2 km) to permit extensive larval diffusion. Total spat density also did not vary significantly between settlement racks, indicating that settlement at the spatial scale of meters was relatively homogeneous. Only three species of spat were found-Tubastraea coccinea, Madracis decactis, and Montastraea sp.; the taxonomic composition of coral spat varied from those observed earlier on the E-FGB-Agaricia and Porites. The dominant recruits matched the dominant adults on the platforms an unusual situation. Tubastraea and Madracis spat densities, respectively, did not vary significantly between platforms or between racks. Because of low recruitment levels, these artificial reef communities may be considered fragile in comparison to many natural ones because of the time required for recovery in the event of a mass coral mortality. These low recruitment levels, however, when integrated over similar to 30 yr, can result in the successful establishment of adult coral communities on the platforms.",,,,,,,,,2,0,0,0,2,0,2,,,1087-688X,,,,,,,,,,,"Louisiana Univ Marine Consortium, LUMCON, 8124 Highway 56, Chauvin, LA 70344 USA",,,,2015-06-24,BCI:BCI201500468999,,

Although the potential environmental impacts of offshore oil and gas activities are widely recognized, there is limited understanding of their impacts on migratory and resident birds. A literature review identified 24 studies and reports of bird-platform interactions, most being qualitative and half having been peer-reviewed. The most frequently observed effect, for seabirds and landbirds, is attraction and sometimes collisions associated with lights and flares; episodic events have caused the deaths of hundreds or even thousands of birds. Though typically unpredictable, anecdotally, it is known that poor weather, such as fog, precipitation and low cloud cover, can exacerbate the effect of nocturnal attraction to lights, especially when coincidental with bird migrations. Other effects include provision of foraging and roosting opportunities, increased exposure to oil and hazardous environments, increased exposure to predators, or repulsion from feeding sites. Current approaches to monitoring birds at offshore platforms have focused on observer-based methods which can offer species-level bird identification, quantify seasonal patterns of relative abundance and distribution, and document avian mortality events and underlying factors. Observer-based monitoring is time-intensive, limited in spatial and temporal coverage, and suffers without clear protocols and when not conducted by trained, independent observers. These difficulties are exacerbated because deleterious bird-platform interaction is episodic and likely requires the coincidence of multiple factors (e.g., darkness, cloud, fog, rain conditions, occurrence of birds in vicinity). Collectively, these considerations suggest a need to implement supplemental systems for monitoring bird activities around offshore platforms. Instrument-based approaches, such as radar, cameras, acoustic recordings, and telemetry, hold promise for continuous monitoring. Recommendations are provided for a rigorous and comprehensive monitoring approach within an adaptive management framework. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

A concomitant effect is the increase in oxygen consumption through respiration of living biomass and especially through degradation of dead biomass, mainly Mytilus edulis. This leads to impacts on the regional oxygen budget, and local anoxia in the direct vicinity of wind farm piles has been documented in scientific literature. The present study investigates the regional impact of multiple wind farms on oxygen concentration levels and on the appearance of hypoxia. A five-year data sampling with a steel cylinder and fouling plates delivered data for a 3D ecosystem model. The results show that wind farms do not lead to a significant decrease in oxygen on the mesoscale level.

Such ecosystem models allow simulating the possible reef and reserve effects associated to the presence of the farm, and to character the overall changes in the food-web functioning. This holistic view of OWF effects could be replicated on other sites and form the basis of an ecosystem based management of marine renewable energies. However, to use these models for management purpose, they need to be validated. In order to do so, stable isotope ratios of nitrogen were used for determining the accuracy of the effective trophic levels computed in these two models. Results showed that trophic levels estimated by the two models were consistent with the trophic levels estimated by the independent isotopic data.

The general requirements for these systems have been previously worked out by the Research Department for Underwater Acoustics and Marine Geophysics of the Bundeswehr. In this article, the major results of the research project Investigation of Sonar Transponders for Offshore Wind Farms are presented. For theoretical investigations a hybrid approach was implemented using the boundary element method to calculate the source directivity and a three-dimensional ray-tracing algorithm to estimate the transmission loss. The angle-dependence of the sound field as well as the weather-dependence of the transmission loss are compared to experimental results gathered at the offshore wind farm alpha ventus, located 45 km north of the island Borkum. While theoretical and experimental results are in general agreement, the implemented model slightly underestimates scattering at the rough sea surface. It is found that the source level of 200 dB re 1 mu Pa at 1 m is adequate to satisfy the detectability of the warning sequence at distances up to 2 NM (approximate to 3.7 km) within a horizontal sector of +/- 60 degrees if realistic assumptions about signal-processing and noise are made.

The presence of turbine foundations introduces hard substrates into areas previously dominated by soft sediments, implying that artificial reef effects may occur, with potential benefits for fisheries. This review focuses on the possibilities for locating fisheries for two commercially important decapods, the brown crab Cancer pagurus and the European lobster Homarus gammarus, within offshore wind farms.Existing understanding of habitat use by C pagurus and H. gammarus suggests that turbine foundations have the potential to act as artificial reefs, although the responses of these species to noise and electromagnetic fields are poorly understood. Offshore wind farm monitoring programmes provide very limited information, but do suggest that adult C pagurus associate with turbine foundations, which may also serve as nursery areas. There was insufficient deployment and monitoring of rock armouring to draw conclusions about the association of H. gammarus with offshore wind farm foundations. The limited information currently available demonstrates the need for further research into the ecological and socioeconomic issues surrounding fishery co-location potential. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

While ICZM cannot solve all political problems, it meets some planning needs. Recently, integrated approaches have become more and more influential in legislation, but a significant implementation gap exists. To overcome this gap, new modes of coastal governance need to be established (e. g., moving from management of single human activities to management of use patterns, from protection of individual species to protection of ecosystems, or from single scales to multiple scales). The second part of the article describes the integrative approach of the German research project Coastal Futures. Using the DPSIR (drivers, pressure, state, impact, response) framework, scenario storylines were used to describe potential marine use patterns causing different ecological and socio-economic impacts.

Using surface trawls, we monitored prey abundance before and after construction of a 30 turbine offshore wind farm sited close to an internationally important colony of Little terns. Observations confirmed that young-of-the-year clupeids dominated chick diet, which trawl samples suggested were mainly herring. Multivariate modelling indicated a significant reduction in herring abundance from 2004 onwards that could not be explained by environmental factors. Intensely noisy monopile installation during the winter spawning period was suggested to be responsible. Reduced prey abundance corresponded with a significant decline in Little tern foraging success. Unprecedented egg abandonment and lack of chick hatching tentatively suggested a colony-scale response in some years.

This has led to a significant increase in production in recent years, especially offshore wind turbine embedded in shallow waters, such as the recent large scale offshore wind farms in the Northern Europe region. Being at the offshore waters, the wind turbines are subjected to harsh environment. The pile supporting the wind turbine must be reliable and able to withstand such sea condition. It is an important part of the design to study the structural behaviour of the piles under the wave loads.Due to the significant capital cost associated with the fabrication of the large circular cylinders, a new recommended innovative design to overcome such problem is to substitute the circular cylinder with a vertical monopile of octagonal cross-sectional shape. This paper describes the development of an efficient numerical model for structural analysis of wave interaction with octagonal pile using a modified semi analytical Scaled Boundary Finite Element Method (SBFEM). In contrast to the existing solutions obtained using the traditional methods such as the Finite Element Method (FEM) which typically suffer from high computational cost and the Boundary Element Method (BEM) which faces limitation from fundamental equations and problems with singularities.

These floaters need to be located among a range of position by its mooring system, e.g. tension tendon and catenary mooring-line, so as to guarantee structural safety and stability under environmental loads. Catenary mooring-line is increasingly used due to its lower cost and easier installation. Its dynamics coming from structure and fluid flow becomes more obvious with the increase of structural length, which may introduce significant impact on restoring performance of mooring-line. In this study, the non-linearly restoring performance and the hysteresis behavior of mooring-line's stiffness are studied. The nonlinear dynamic model of the mooring-line is established based on the improved FEM simulations. It is found that the restoring stiffness of the catenary mooring-line presents a hysteresis characteristic, principally owing to the damping effect of the catenary dynamics, which gets more obvious with the increase of motion amplitude/frequency. And, the mooring-line dynamics has significant impacts on the tension (related to its restoring stiffness) and displacement response, e.g. the maximum tension amplitude is up to 5.2 times of the quasi-static value if slack happens.",,,,,,,,,7,2,0,0,0,0,9,,,0029-8018,,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Paris Saclay, Lab MSSMat, Cent Supelec, F-91190 Gif Sur Yvette, FranceChinese Acad Sci, Inst Mech, Key Lab Mech Fluid Solid Coupling Syst, Beijing 100190, Peoples R ChinaAVIC Composite Technol Ctr, AVIC Mfg Technol Inst, Beijing 101300, Peoples R ChinaUniv Chinese Acad Sci, Sch Engn Sci, Beijing 100049, Peoples R ChinaBeijing Univ Aeronaut & Astronaut, Sino French Engn Sch, Beijing 100191, Peoples R China",,,,2020-07-07,WOS:000542188700005,,

In this paper, the authors propose the method of site selection for installing a FOWT by quantitative risk assessment, taking account of the spatial relations between the FOWT and surrounding sea-lanes, coastal facilities and ecosystem. Based on the calculation results in the case study of the quantitative risk assessment, the following procedure is recommended: first, extract the area where the risks related to the sea-lane are small enough, and second, select the position within the extracted area with the smallest risk of collision with coastal facilities or ecosystem in case of drift of the FOWT by quantitative evaluation of the risk distribution under the environmental conditions in the area.

Few studies have examined basin-scale variation in Hg accumulation in marine ecosystems, and determining if Hg concentrations in fish tissue vary across marine ecosystems is a key monitoring question. The present study evaluated Hg concentrations in red snapper (Lutjanus campechanus) tissue across three regions of the northern Gulf of Mexico (Alabama, Louisiana, and Texas, USA) and between two habitat types (oil and gas platforms and nonplatforms) within each region. Nitrogen (d15N), carbon (d13C), and sulfur (d34S) stable isotopes were used to investigate ecological differences that may affect Hg concentrations among regions and between habitats. Mercury concentrations in red snapper tissue were positively correlated with fish total length. Regional differences in Hg concentrations were significant, with fish collected from Alabama having the highest concentrations and fish collected from Louisiana having the lowest. No significant difference existed in Hg concentrations between habitats, suggesting that association with platforms may not be a significant factor contributing to red snapper Hg concentrations. While d15N did not differ significantly among the three regions, Texas red snapper were more enriched in d34S and depleted in d13C compared with Alabama and Louisiana red snapper. Although the majority of red snapper collected in the present study had Hg concentrations below safe consumption guidelines, regional differences suggest that spatially explicit monitoring programs may be important for basin-wide assessments.

Since seabirds represent avoidance response to OWFs, risks of collisions between flying seabirds and the turbines may be relatively small. However, based on theoretical assuming of additional energetic costs of such avoidance flights, those potential impact on the body condition are considerable. The wind turbines and those base structures reduce or modify the foraging habitat of the seabirds and potentially alter food availability. While additional mortality and decline of breeding success by collision and the additional energetic costs are theoretically estimated, these estimation may not be so accurate because of lacking of sufficient empirical data and great uncertainties. Further long-term empirical studies and after-construction monitoring are needed. To mitigate the impact of OWFs on the seabirds, avoidance of construction of OWFs at the important foraging area and migratory rout, and adaptive management including turning off turbines during breeding and migrating season are required.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,0285-4376,,,,,,,,,,,"Hokkaido Univ, Grad Sch Fisheries Sci, Sapporo, Hokkaido, Japan",,,,2018-03-01,ZOOREC:ZOOR15403015069,,

How these artificial structures affect fish populations is largely unknown, and there is ongoing debate regarding their value as surrogate habitats for ecologically and economically important reef fish species. Thus, the purpose of this study was to characterize trends in Red Snapper Lutjanus campechanus reproductive potential in the western Gulf at oil and gas platform reefs relative to reproductive potential at natural banks. Red Snapper (n = 1,585) were collected during 2013-2015 from standing platforms, decommissioned platform artificial reefs, and natural banks by using standardized vertical line gear. Comparisons of gonadosomatic index, male : female ratios, batch fecundity, annual fecundity, spawning frequency, and number of spawning-capable individuals indicated that Red Snapper reproductive biology was similar among natural bank, standing platform, and artificial reef habitats. These results suggest that in terms of reproductive output, fish inhabiting artificial reefs are functionally similar to similar-aged fish on natural banks. This work can be used to make informed management decisions and suggests that there are benefits to converting decommissioned platforms into designated artificial reefs. Future studies should consider site-specific characteristics, such as depth, vertical relief, and proximity to other structures, to elucidate how habitat characteristics may influence reproduction, ultimately improving future artificial reef deployments for fisheries enhancement in the western Gulf.",,,,,,,,,16,0,0,0,13,0,18,,,0002-8487,1548-8659,,,,,,,,,,"Texas Pk & Wildlife Dept Coastal Fisheries, Upper Laguna Madre Ecosyst, Nat Resource Ctr, Suite 2500,6300 Ocean Dr,Unit 5845, Corpus Christi, TX 78412 USATexas A&M Univ Corpus Christi, Harte Res Inst Gulf Mexico Studies, 6300 Ocean Dr,Unit 5869, Corpus Christi, TX 78412 USAFlorida Atlantic Univ, Harbor Branch Oceanog Inst, 5600 US-1 North, Ft Pierce, FL 34946 USA",Texas Pk & Wildlife Dept Coastal Fisheries,,,2018-12-28,WOS:000450602900002,,

Machine learning is widely applied in acoustic research to improve the efficiency of audio processing. However, the use of machine learning to analyze marine soundscapes remains limited due to a general lack of human-annotated databases. In this study, we used unsupervised learning to recognize different sound sources underwater. We also quantified the temporal, spatial, and spectral variabilities of long-term underwater recordings collected near Phase I of the Formosa I wind farm. One source separation model was developed to recognize choruses made by fish and snapping shrimp, as well as shipping noise. Another model was developed to identify transient fish calls and echolocation clicks of marine mammals. Models were trained in an unsupervised manner using the periodicity-coded non-negative matrix factorization. After the sound sources were separated, events can be identified using Gaussian mixture models. Our information retrieval techniques facilitate future investigations of the spatiotemporal changes in marine soundscapes and allow to build an annotated database efficiently.

Near-bottom, biological surveys were conducted at a petroleum platform located in 305 m water depth off the coast of Louisiana between 268 m and the seabed. Surveys were performed with a remotely operated vehicle (ROV) and consisted of replicated benthic transects on all four sides of the platform extending 125 m outward from the platform. The fouling community on hard surfaces of the horizontal cross-members and verticals were surveyed using HD video and digital still images. Relative abundances of fishes were estimated using digital still images collected at regular intervals under three illumination regimes: no light, red light, and white light, while the ROV hydraulics were switched off to reduce vehicle noise. Additional surveys of fishes were conducted during day and night at the platform and at two far-field sites located 2 km and 3 km from the platform by monitoring species attracted to buckets containing an olfactory attractant. The results indicated abundant coldwater coral Lophelia pertusa present on the platform and on the surrounding rubble near the platform.

Off California, this decommissioning option would kill large numbers of platform-associated and commercially important groundfishes that inhabit the bases of the platforms, and may potentially affect regional fish populations. Capturing and translocating fishes before removing a platform might mitigate the effects of platform removal. In this study, we acoustically tagged 79 rockfishes and lingcod from three oil platforms in the east Santa Barbara Channel and translocated them to a natural reef inside a state marine reserve at Anacapa Island to determine whether individuals would home back to their platforms of capture, or take up residency at their new location. Movements between natural and platform habitats were monitored over a two-year period. Twenty-five percent of all tagged fishes translocated to a natural reef returned to their home platforms relatively quickly, traveling distances from 11 km to >= 18 km, in 10.5 h to 17 d. Those that did not home took up residency at Anacapa Island, moved to Santa Cruz Island or out of the range of detection. Although a small proportion of fish (25%) homed back to the platforms, a higher proportion (75%) remained at their platforms of release. Those that homed back to their platform of capture did so relatively quickly (avg 15 +/- 31 d). Lingcod had the highest probability of homing back to their platform of capture, typically doing so in < 1 day. These results suggest that fish translocation may be a successful, but costly mitigation strategy for platforms that require full decommissioning and that some species may be more successfully translocated than others.",,,,,,,,,11,0,0,0,11,0,16,,,0038-3872,2162-4534,,,,,,,,,,"Calif State Univ Long Beach, Dept Biol Sci, 1250 Bellflower Blvd, Long Beach, CA 90840 USA",,,,2013-02-22,BCI:BCI201300188586,,

We studied whether harbour porpoise occurrence has been affected by the presence of the Dutch offshore wind farm Egmond aan Zee. This was done by studying acoustic activity of porpoises in the wind farm and in two reference areas using stationary acoustic monitoring (with T-PODs) prior to construction (baseline: June 2003 to June 2004) and during normal operation of the wind farm (operation: April 2007 to April 2009). The results show a strong seasonal pattern, with more activity recorded during winter months. There was also an overall increase in acoustic activity from baseline to operation, in line with a general increase in porpoise abundance in Dutch waters over the last decade. The acoustic activity was significantly higher inside the wind farm than in the reference areas, indicating that the occurrence of porpoises in this area increased as well. The reasons of this apparent preference for the wind farm area are not clear. Two possible causes are discussed: an increased food availability inside the wind farm (reef effect) and/or the absence of vessels in an otherwise heavily trafficked part of the North Sea (sheltering effect).",,,,,,,,,83,1,0,0,64,0,92,,,1748-9326,,,,,,,,,,,"IMARES, Dept Ecosyst, NL-1790 AD Den Burg, NetherlandsAarhus Univ, Natl Environm Res Inst, Dept Arct Environm, DK-4000 Roskilde, DenmarkWageningen Univ, Dept Aquat Ecol & Water Qual Management, NL-6700 DD Wageningen, Netherlands",,,,2011-04-01,WOS:000295326800029,,

These structures have been shown to be important habitats for both settlement and growth for reef fishes. Important information on the biological effects (i.e., loss of biomass and production) of different decommissioning options has not yet been explored in detail. An important step in the assessment of these different decommissioning options is to look at the potential loss of fish production and habitat under the different alternatives. Using the large amount of information available on fish abundances at these structures, we have created a model to estimate the standing stock of fishes and production that would be lost because of both partial (removal from surface to 85 ft) and complete removal (the 2 decommissioning options being considered). Complete removal of a platform will likely eliminate most of its fish biomass; however, this study has shown that for rockfishes, which settle predominantly below 85 feet (26 m) and move deeper as they age, partial removal through topping would leave more than 90% of the fish biomass at the deeper platforms. Modeling of larval dispersal suggests that platforms provide an important opportunity for recruitment of fish larvae and that many larvae produced near the platforms would settle elsewhere in the region. The results presented here indicate that, even if topped, the potential contribution of platform habitat to biological resources (e.g., fish production) in this region is significant.

Platforms provide substrate for sessile organisms such as barnacles and oysters that enhance habitat for stone crabs Menippe spp. and other fouling-associated organisms. In recent years, Louisiana's small nearshore platforms (<15 m) have been subjected to a high rate of removal, but little is known about their relative value as artificial reefs. During 2014, we compared stone crab populations at platforms on and off Ship Shoal in order to evaluate habitat conditions in the two areas. We hypothesized that platforms on the shoal would provide higher quality habitat than those in the surrounding area because the shoal supports higher diversity and abundances of benthic organisms. Stone crab populations were characterized by means of visual counts and by removing subsamples for species identification, sexing, and carapace measurements. Of the 378 stone crabs collected, 368 were Gulf stone crabs M. adina and 10 were Cuban stone crabs M. nodifrons. Stone crabs colonized every platform studied, but densities were higher (mean values: 4.0 crabs/m(2) on the shoal versus 1.8 crabs/m(2) off the shoal), and carapace width at 50% maturity (CW50) was 27.1 mm larger for crabs on than off the shoal. Mean carapace width, size-class distribution, and sex ratio of crabs on and off the shoal were not significantly different. Platforms provided substrate for barnacles, which enhanced the structural complexity of platforms and were observed to be prey for stone crabs. Nevertheless, higher stone crab density and CW50 on the shoal suggested that shoal platforms are better habitat types for stone crabs.",,,,,,,,,7,0,0,0,6,0,7,,,0002-8487,1548-8659,,,,,,,,,,"Louisiana State Univ, Dept Oceanog & Coastal Sci, 1002-Y Energy Coast & Environm Bldg, Baton Rouge, LA 70803 USALouisiana Univ Marine Consortium, 8124 Highway 56, Chauvin, LA 70344 USALouisiana State Univ, Dept Expt Stat, 161 MD Woodin Hall, Baton Rouge, LA 70803 USA",Louisiana Univ Marine Consortium,,,2017-05-10,WOS:000399571200001,,

In this work, underwater visual census techniques were applied to describe spatial and temporal patterns of fish assemblages associated with extractive platforms. Data were collected during three seasons according to the following spatial factors: Location (Adriatic and Ionian Seas), Depth (0-6 m and 12-18 m) and Distance from the platform (external and internal). Both univariate and multivariate analyses showed highly significant differences for each factor assessed in this study, as well as for the interaction among said factors. Results indicated that artificial structures in both the Adriatic and Ionian Seas act as artificial reefs attracting reef-dwelling or partially reef-dwelling species, which are not present far from the platforms in open waters. Results also showed significant differences between Ionian and Adriatic fish assemblages, with a higher mean density of fish and a greater mean number of species in the latter basin. Boops boops, Chromis chromis and several species belonging to the Blennidae family most contributed to these differences. This is likely due to the eutrophication that involves the coast of the northern and central Adriatic, allowing a high production of fish, especially planctivorous. Thanks to the eutrophication, platforms located in this basin are characterized by a greater abundance of fouling organisms which offer a perfect habitat for cryptobenthic species, such as Blennids. Moreover, Thalassoma pavo and Scorpaena maderensis, thermophilic species, were more abundant in the Ionian platforms than in the Adriatic ones thus contributing to the dissimilarities between these two basins. Present results could bear strong implications for the environmental management of drilling and production activities in different basins. Assessing biodiversity in these highly complex contexts is a challenge for the near future, and the existence of a reliable method such as UVC would affect international research in this field.

More specifically we will try to resolve the attraction-ecological trap-production issue for Atlantic cod and pouting at WARs and link the information to opportunities for fisheries activities. From 2009 until 2012 the behavioural ecology of Atlantic cod and pouting was investigated at WARs in the Belgian part of the North Sea (BPNS). Information on length-frequency distribution, diet, community structure and movements were combined to gain insights on the behavioural ecology and to unravel whether production occurs. We demonstrated that specific age groups of Atlantic cod and pouting are seasonally attracted towards the WARs, that they show high site fidelity and feed upon the dominant epifaunal prey species present. Growth was observed throughout the period the fishes were present. Production on a local scale can be assumed. On a regional scale however, no changes were observed yet. Based on the acquired knowledge we judged that no fisheries activities should be allowed inside the offshore wind farms in the BPNS.",,,,,,,,,48,1,0,0,31,0,50,,,0018-8158,1573-5117,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Ghent, Dept Biol, Marine Biol Res Grp, B-9000 Ghent, BelgiumRoyal Belgian Inst Nat Sci, Marine Ecosyst Management Sect, Operat Directorate Nat Environm, B-1200 Brussels, Belgium",,,,2014-03-15,WOS:000330967900009,,

This article presents the results of an open-sea experimental activity on a 1:30 scale model of the OC3-Hywind spar, in parked rotor conditions, carried out at the Natural Ocean Engineering Laboratory (NOEL) of Reggio Calabria (Italy). The aim of the experiment is two-fold. Firstly, it aims to assess the feasibility of low-cost, intermediate-scale, open-sea activities on offshore structures, which are proposed to substitute or complement the traditional indoor activities in ocean basins. Secondly, it provides useful experimental data on damping properties of spar support structures for offshore wind turbines, with respect to heave, roll and pitch degrees of freedom.

It is one of the only viable approaches to making sustainable building materials at scale which also yields multiple marine biodiversity and climate change adaptation benefits.

This modelling approach provides the mean to consider alternative hypotheses about how the ecosystem structure and function affects its dynamics. Alternative models were constructed to address the different hypotheses regarding the behaviour of top predator (whether the top predators will be scared away by the OWF or attracted by the reef effect), impacts of global warming and changes in fisheries activities. Key findings from these analyses are that the OWF construction could lead to an increase in benthos species and fish benthos feeders whatever the perturbation scenario, while the predicted response of top predators was ambiguous across all perturbation scenario.

While all life stages of tiger sharks are known to occur in the Gulf of Mexico (GoM), variability in habitat use and movement patterns over ontogeny have never been quantified in this large marine ecosystem. To address this data gap we fitted 56 tiger sharks with Smart Position and Temperature transmitting tags between 2010 and 2018 and examined seasonal and spatial distribution patterns across the GoM. Additionally, we analyzed overlap of core habitats (i.e., 50% kernel density estimates) among individuals relative to large benthic features (oil and gas platforms, natural banks, bathymetric breaks). Our analyses revealed significant ontogenetic and seasonal differences in distribution patterns as well as across-shelf (i.e., regional) and sex-linked variability in movement rates. Presumably sub-adult and adult sharks achieved significantly higher movement rates and used off-shelf deeper habitats at greater proportions than juvenile sharks, particularly during the fall and winter seasons. Further, female maximum rate of movement was higher than males when accounting for size. Additionally, we found evidence of core regions encompassing the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration designated Habitat Areas of Particular Concern (i.e., shelf-edge banks) during cooler months, particularly by females, as well as 2,504 oil and gas platforms. These data provide a baseline for future assessments of environmental impacts, such as climate variability or oil spills, on tiger shark movements and distribution in the region. Future research may benefit from combining alternative tracking tools, such as acoustic telemetry and genetic approaches, which can facilitate long-term assessment of the species' movement dynamics and better elucidate the ecological significance of the core habitats identified here.",,,,,,,,,22,0,0,0,18,0,26,,,1932-6203,,,,,,,,,,,"Florida Atlantic Univ, Harbor Branch, Oceanog Inst, Ft Pierce, FL 34946 USAMississippi State Univ, Coastal Res & Extens Ctr, Biloxi, MS USAMississippi Alabama Sea Grant, Ocean Springs, MS USAUniv Miami, Rosenstiel Sch Marine & Atmospher Sci, Causeway, Miami, FL 33149 USAUniv Miami, Abess Ctr Ecosyst Sci & Policy, Miami, FL USATexas A&M Univ, Dept Marine Biol, Galveston, TX 77553 USATexas A&M Univ, Dept Wildlife & Fisheries Sci, College Stn, TX 77843 USAMississippi State Univ, Quantitat Ecol & Spatial Technol Lab, Mississippi State, MS 39762 USAMississippi State Univ, Dept Wildlife Fisheries & Aquaculture, Mississippi State, MS 39762 USALouisiana Dept Wildlife & Fisheries, New Orleans, LA USANOAA, Fisheries Southeast Fisheries Sci Ctr, Mississippi Labs, Pascagoula, MS USAOCEARCH, Park City, UT USATexas A&M Univ Corpus Christi, Harte Res Inst Gulf Mexico Studies, Corpus Christi, TX USA",Mississippi Alabama Sea GrantUniv MiamiLouisiana Dept Wildlife & FisheriesOCEARCH,,,2020-09-01,WOS:000560402000005,32667920,

It has been argued that this effect should be considered during decisions over their removal during decommissioning. In the North Sea, leaving such structures in place is prohibited but derogations are allowed for large concrete installations. To assess removal options for one such installation, the Halfweg GBS (gravity-based structure) a concrete platform foundation off the Dutch coast, we studied the resident fouling macrofauna community. The faunal structure, biomass and trophic composition of the Halfweg was then compared with those from the surrounding seabed sediments, other local artificial structures and a natural rocky reef.In total, 65 macrofaunal species were observed on the concrete (52 species), steel legs (32) and surrounding rock dump (44) of Halfweg. Mean Simpson diversity per sample was highest on the rock dump (0.71) but concrete (0.54) and steel (0.60) of the GBS were lower than seabed (0.69). Ten of the species observed on the concrete were not reported on other substrates while 10 of the species were also observed in the surrounding seabed. The GBS structure was numerically dominated by Arthropoda which comprised 98% of the total abundance. Mean ash free dry weight (AFDW) was significantly higher (p < 0.001) on the Halfweg substrates (204 g AFDW per m2) than in the surrounding seabed (65 g AFDW per m(2)). Over 94% of the biomass on Halfweg consisted of the plumose anemone Metridium senile. While common on other reefs, this species was absent from the surrounding seabed. Macrofaunal feeding mechanisms of the concrete and rock dump communities on the GBS were similar to those of nearby sediments, although these differed from those on the Halfweg steel legs. Therefore, the presence of Halfweg alters the local community feeding modes. Multivariate analysis revealed that taxonomic structure of the GBS and other artificial structures significantly differed from that of the sedi-mentary habitats. Low numbers of non-indigenous species on Halfweg indicated that the structure does not act as a stepping stone for species invasions.Our data show that the Halfweg structures significantly increase local biodiversity and biomass. Removal of the concrete and steel legs of the GBS (leaving the rock dump) will significantly reduce local macrofauna biodiversity. The long-term impact on macrofaunal biomass is low. Leaving the complete Halfweg structure in place will result in an enriched local macrofaunal biodiversity and feeding mode diversity.",,,,,,,,,9,0,0,0,5,0,9,,,1385-1101,1873-1414,,,,,,,,,,"Wageningen Marine Res, POB 57, NL-1780 AB Den Helder, NetherlandsWageningen Univ, Aquat Ecol & Water Qual Management Grp, Droevendaalsesteeg 3a, NL-6708 PD Wageningen, NetherlandsBur Waardenburg, POB 365, NL-4100 AJ Culemborg, NetherlandsCtr Environm Fisheries & Aquaculture Sci Cefas, Lowestoft NR33 0HT, Suffolk, England",Bur Waardenburg,,,2020-12-22,WOS:000591362500005,,

The heights of birds' pathways are less than 100m onshore with population rate reaches around 500 birds/hour. This poses as a real problem to wind turbines with typical elevations which is near to the pathway elevation. To overcome this problem, it is suggested either to use turbines having elevations higher than 100 m height, using turbines with elevations between 40-70m or relocating the wind farm offshore at least 10 km away from the Sea shore.

We investigated the spatial and temporal scale of behavioural responses of harbour porpoises Phocoena phocoena to construction noise using passive acoustic monitoring devices (T-PODs) deployed in a gradient sampling design. Porpoise acoustic activity was reduced by 100% during 1 h after pile driving and stayed below normal levels for 24 to 72 h at a distance of 2.6 km from the construction site. This period gradually decreased with increasing distance. A negative effect was detectable out to a mean distance of 17.8 km. At 22 km it was no longer apparent, instead, porpoise activity temporarily increased. Out to a distance of 4.7 km, the recovery time was longer than most pauses between pile driving events. Consequently, porpoise activity and possibly abundance were reduced over the entire 5 mo construction period.

In this research we investigated the residency, site fidelity and habitat use of Atlantic cod on a temporal scale at windmill artificial reefs in the Belgian part of the North Sea. Acoustic telemetry was used and the Vemco VR2W position system was deployed to quantify the movement behaviour. In total, 22 Atlantic cod were tagged and monitored for up to one year. Many fish were present near the artificial reefs during summer and autumn, and demonstrated strong residency and high individual detection rates. When present within the study area, Atlantic cod also showed distinct habitat selectivity. We identified aggregation near the artificial hard substrates of the wind turbines. In addition, a clear seasonal pattern in presence was observed. The high number of fish present in summer and autumn alternated with a period of very low densities during the winter period.

There are seven rooms divided inside the CBF by steel bulkheads, which are arranged in a honeycomb structure. The six peripheral rooms with the skirt have the same proportions while the middle orthohexagonal one is a little larger. With the seven-room structure, the CBF has reasonable motion characteristics and towing reliability during the wet-tow construction process. Through extensive research into the force transfer characteristics of composite structure systems, a composite bucket foundation structure system with a curved transition part has been developed. The large bending moment and horizontal force of the wind turbine tower are transferred to and dispersed into the sea floor soil through a prestressed curved concrete transition section, the top cover of the bucket foundation, the bucket skirts, and the internal steel compartment plates. Particularly, this proposed CBF structure can effectively convert the extremely large bending moment of the turbine tower to limited tensile and compressive stresses within the foundation structure via a transition section.

In all performed cases, the implemented system was able to ensure that the voltage stays within its steady state limits and to reach a stable operation point. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

These substrates are densely colonized by fouling organisms, which may compete for the available resources. While the distribution of some species is restricted to specific parts of the turbine, others occur across depth zones and may therefore face different competitive environments. Here we investigate the trophic niches of seven invertebrate species: three sessile (Diadumene cincta, Metridium senile, and Mytilus edulis), one hemi-sessile (Jassa herdmani) and three mobile species (Ophiothrix fragilis, Necora puber, and Pisidia longicomis) that occur in multiple depth zones. We hypothesized that these species would be trophic generalists, exhibiting trophic plasticity by selecting different resources in different depth zones, to cope with the different competitive environments in which they occur. We analyzed delta C-13 and delta N-15 of these species and their potential resources across depth zones. Our results show that most of these invertebrates are indeed trophic generalists which display substantial trophic plasticity, selecting different resources in different zones. Degree of trophic plasticity was not related to mobility of the species. There are two possible explanations for these dietary changes with depth: either consumers switch diet to avoid competition with other (dominant) species, or they benefit from the consumption of a non-limiting resource. Only Diadumene cincta was a trophic specialist that consumed suspended particulate organic matter (SPOM) independent of its zone of occurrence. Altogether, trophic plasticity appears an important mechanism for the co-existence of invertebrate species along the depth gradient of an offshore wind turbine.",,,,,,,,,18,0,0,0,12,0,19,,,,2296-7745,,,,,,,,,,"Royal Belgian Inst Nat Sci, Operat Directorate Nat Environm Marine Ecol & Man, Brussels, BelgiumUniv Ghent, Dept Biol, Marine Biol Res Grp, Ghent, Belgium",,,,2020-06-16,WOS:000537628000001,,

However, despite its perceived benefits, OWF construction will also lead to direct and indirect impacts on the ecosystem. Nonetheless, surprisingly few studies have sought to combine trophic web modelling tools with the framework of OWF impact assessment. The objective of this study was to develop a holistic and integrated ecosystem approach as a complementary methodology to the traditional OWF environmental impact assessment. To that end, trophic web models coupled with Ecological Network Analysis indices were used to study the structure and functioning of three sedimentary types (sandy gravel, gravelly sand, and medium sand), identified on the proposed site for a new offshore wind farm at Dieppe-Le Treport (Normandy coast). The results from this study demonstrated that the trophic structures are strongly linked to the sedimentary types. The results also highlighted the existence of a maturity gradient moving between the three types of sediment identified. This study underlined the challenge and the need to have detailed biomass data on a maximum of biological compartments to enable an effective OWF impact assessment. We strongly consider that our approach will provide useful and practical information for environmental decision-makers and stakeholders.

Measurements were performed at two different types of wind turbines: a Sinovel 3 MW SL3000 turbine and a Shanghai Electric 3.6 MW W3600 turbine. The two turbines show similar tower vibration characteristics, characterized by a number of tonal components, mainly in the low-frequency domain (30-500 Hz). The peak vibration frequencies changed with the wind speed until the turbine approached its nominal power rating. Spectral analysis of the underwater acoustic data showed that the amplitude spectra had a strong correlation with the spectra of the turbine vibration intensity level, indicating that the measured underwater noise was generated by the tower mechanical vibration.

It was initially observed on one oil platform (GI-93C) near the Mississippi River. Here, we determined whether its populations were spreading and whether there was evidence of rapid expansion. We compared population density data of T. micranthus with those from T. coccinea, a congener which invaded the western Atlantic earlier. Fourteen oil/gas platforms were assessed down to 138 m depth using remotely operated vehicle digital video. Colony den sities in numbers m(-2) were determined for both species, and colony size was measured for T. micranthus. Data were analyzed by platform and for geographic distribution. T. micranthus densities were highest on GI-93C and on GI-116A, SW of the Mississippi River, being significantly higher than on other platforms. Densities declined radially from there. Mean colony size was highest on MC-311A, with colonies generally being > 100 cm(2). This platform is situated at the head of the Mississippi Canyon and may have been the original site of colonization. It also receives blue water instead of turbid, lower salinity water, and this species may grow better under those conditions. T. micranthus size frequency distributions were generally skewed towards 1-200 cm(2) (5 cm diameter) (sometimes > 90% of the population), suggesting that most populations are potentially in an expanding growth phase. T. coccinea densities were high (range: similar to 50 to 300 colonies m(-2)). Its populations were also centered SW of the Mississippi River.

Most of the respondents to our telephone survey claim to support offshore wind energy development, and independent survey data suggest that the observed levels of support may be indicative of the broader population in this region. Overall, we find very little impact of coastal wind turbines on aggregate recreational visitation; loss in annual consumer surplus associated with wide spread wind development in the coastal zone is insignificant at $17 (or about 1.5% of annual consumer surplus). Results suggest that NC local coastal tourists are averse to wind farms in the near-shore zone; average compensating variation for wind farms one mile from the shore is estimated at $55 per household. On average, we find no evidence of aversion to wind farms 4 miles out in the ocean, or for wind farms located in coastal estuaries.

An approach based on copulas was used to generate lumped joint met-ocean data in a location where only marginals (i.e., individual, univariate probability distributions) are known. Empirical copulas were calculated for different stations in the North Sea for pairs of wind speed and wave height variables. These copulas are then combined with marginals from another station to generate lumped data. The generated data is compared with the known lumped joint data, and the difference of two methods is measured. The lumped values are used to estimate fatigue damage based on simple formulas. The results show that the joint behaviour of wind speed and wave height follows a similar pattern around the North Sea. In addition, the mean difference of generated lumped wind speeds based on this technique from lumped wind speeds based on real measurements is less than 5%. The mean difference of the fatigue damage caused by the generated lumped wind speeds relative to lumped wind speeds based on real measurements is less than 5% at two locations, and less than 15% in another location. This suggests that the approach is promising for estimating joint met-ocean data at new locations in the North Sea where only marginals are available, which is of major interest for wind farm planning and design.",,,,,16th Deep Sea Offshore Wind R and D Conference (EERA DeepWind)16th Deep Sea Offshore Wind R and D Conference (EERA DeepWind),"JAN 16-18, 2019JAN 16-18, 2019",NTNU; European Energy Res AllianceNTNU; European Energy Res Alliance,"SINTEF, Trondheim, NORWAYSINTEF, Trondheim, NORWAY",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,1742-6588,1742-6596,*****************,,,,,,,,,"NTNU, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Hogskoleringen 7A, N-7491 Trondheim, Norway",,,,2020-09-08,WOS:000562374000042,,

This paper explores the factors that affect stakeholders' (traditional ocean users, including fishers and aquaculture farmers) acceptance and conducts an empirical analysis to determine the relationship among stakeholders' perceptions and acceptance. A total of 238 respondents completed a survey that was conducted in six coastal counties in western Taiwan. We used principle component analysis and two logistic regression models for the analysis: one model does not consider perception factors, while the other model estimates perception factors. The empirical results reveal that three perception factors related to the benefits of offshore wind farms significantly affect stakeholders' acceptance. Furthermore, the explanatory power, goodness-of-fit, and the predicted probability are greater when perception factors are considered in the logistic model. As a result, stakeholders' perceptions are important factors that influence their acceptance of OWFs along the western coast of Taiwan. According to our findings, recommendations are offered to resolve the user conflicts regarding OWF turbine construction and operation, including (1) communicating effectively and integrating stakeholder participation and (2) offering benefits to ocean users and local communities.

The removal of overlying platforms eliminates this food subsidy, but large shell mounds remain. The distribution, abundance, and population characteristics of mobile macroinvertebrates differed among shell mounds beneath existing offshore oil platforms, shell mounds at the former sites of offshore oil platforms, and soft bottom. Predatory and omnivorous echinoderm and mollusk species were more abundant and generally larger on shell mounds under platforms than on shell mounds without platforms. Omnivorous and deposit feeding echinoderms were the most abundant macroinvertebrate taxa sampled on mound-only sites. The brown rock crab (Cancer antennarius), known to have a strong preference for hard substrate, was significantly more abundant on shell mounds, with or without platforms, than adjacent soft bottom sites. Results suggest that the effects of platform removal differed among benthic species according to trophic level, degree of mobility, and substrate preference.

As these structures are decommissioned, they must be removed; however, some are converted to permanent artificial reefs. Despite the potential effects these artificial habitats may have on marine fisheries, investigations that assess the fish communities inhabiting these structures relative to natural habitats are rare. During fall 2012, we used remotely operated vehicle surveys to compare fish communities between artificial reefs (i.e., reefed platforms; n = 5) and adjacent natural banks (n = 5) in the western GOM. Our surveys successfully documented 79 species representing 28 families. Multivariate analyses suggested that fish communities at artificial reefs were distinct from those at natural banks. Post hoc analyses indicated that the differences were driven by high abundances of transient, midwater pelagics and other gregarious species at artificial reefs. Many fisheries species, like the Red Snapper Lutjanus campechanus, were found in both habitat types, with density at artificial reefs estimated to be nearly eight times greater than at natural banks. Despite lower densities at natural banks, the disproportionately large areas of these habitats resulted in relatively high total abundance estimates-approximately 5% of the 2012 GOM Red Snapper annual catch limit (3.67 million kg [8.08 million lb])-a finding that has significant implications for Red Snapper and artificial reef management in the GOM. Our study suggests that although fish community structure may differ between these two habitats, artificial reefs serve as important habitat for species like Red Snapper by potentially diverting fishing pressure from natural habitats; however, future studies that address species-specific life history traits will be needed to better understand the function and performance of artificial reefs in supporting fisheries productivity.",,,,,,,,,34,0,0,0,28,0,40,,,1942-5120,,,,,,,,,,,"Texas A&M Univ, Harte Res Inst Gulf Mexico Studies, Unit 5869, 6300 Ocean Dr, Corpus Christi, TX 78412 USAFlorida Atlantic Univ, Harbor Branch Oceanog Inst, 5600 US 1 North, Ft Pierce, FL 34946 USA",,,,2018-12-28,WOS:000407996400014,,

The heart of this so-called 'harmonised mandatory control system' is the 'chemical hazard assessment and risk management' (CHARM) model. This model enables the ranking of chemicals on the basis of their intrinsic properties, using a realistic worst-case scenario. To meet the prerequisites of the model (simple and transparent calculation rules), the CHARM model uses a fixed dilution factor, assuming equal and constant dispersion of chemicals around the platform. In reality, however, the chemical follows a three-dimensional dispersion pattern which will change over time. To be able to use the principles of the CHARM model in such a dynamic situation for risk management, a new model has been developed by TNO in cooperation with Dutch Oil (NAM). This model gives a probabilistic estimation of the ecological risk of produced water, based upon a realistic calculation of the fate of components of produced water after discharge from the platform. Spatial and temporal variation in the concentration of chemicals is summarised in frequency distributions. The ecological risk is calculated for aquatic life, benthic Life and the food chain. The model aims to support the selection of cost-effective mitigating measures for risk reduction. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.

Beam trawling has affected macrobenthic assemblages for centuries, especially the fragile and long-lived species. Due to the prohibition of bean trawling in many OWFs, opportunities are being provided to investigate the potential recovery of vulnerable species and the creation of de-facto Marine Protected Areas (MPAs). The soft-substrate macrobenthic community was investigated from 2008 to 2012, before and after the construction of an OWF in the Belgian part of the North Sea, situated on the Bligh Bank. The fishery enclosed area (+/-21 km(2)) within the OWF (No Fishery area) was compared with a surrounding control area (+/-30 km(2)) where regular fishing activities were registered through vessel monitoring system (VMS) data throughout the period 2010-2011. Three years after the exclusion of beam trawl fisheries, subtle changes within the macrobenthic community were observed in the No Fishery area. The benthic mysid shrimp Gastrosaccus spinifer (30 +/- 15 ind m(-2)), tube-building polychaetes Terebellidae sp. (196 +/- 151 ind m(-2)) and the echinoderm Echinocyamus pusillus (73 +/- 71 ind m(-2)), sensitive to trawling activities, showed increased abundances within the No Fishery area. With an expansion of the wind farm concession area to 238 km(2) in the future, the likely increase of dense Terebellidae patches (e.g., Lanice conchilega reefs) within the No Fishery area could create an ecological important large-scale refugium for higher trophic levels. This study creates a baseline for the evaluation of long-term changes due to the fishing impacts and effects related to the presence of OWFs and highlights the importance of executing long-term monitoring programs in combination with targeted research.

In this work, a tapered beam model is proposed to investigate the dynamic response of an offshore wind turbine tower on the monopile foundation assembled with rotating blades in the complex ocean environment. Several environment factors like wind, wave, current, and soil resistance are taken into account. The proposed model is analytically solved with the Galerkin method. Based on the numerical results, the effects of various structure parameters including the taper angle, the height and thickness of the tower, the depth, and the diameter and the cement filler of the monopile on the fundamental natural frequency of the wind turbine tower system are investigated in detail. It is found that the fundamental natural frequency decreases with the increase in the taper angle and the height and thickness of the tower, and increases with the increase in the diameter of the monopile. Moreover, filling cement into the monopile can effectively improve the fundamental natural frequency of the wind turbine tower system, but there is a critical value of the amount of cement maximizing the property of the monopile.

External vibration sources such as aerodynamic, sea wave and seismic loadings can threaten the safety of these energy infrastructures. It is important to evaluate the reliability of offshore wind turbines subjected to external vibration sources. Previous research works on the wind turbine fragility analyses only considered the fragility of the tower by assuming the wind turbine was in the parked condition with the blade mass lumped at the top of the tower. The study of the fragility of the blade which is one of the most important components of a wind turbine has not been reported. In the present study, a detailed three-dimensional (3D) finite element (FE) model of the NREL 5 MW wind turbine is developed in ABAQUS, and the tower and blades are explicitly modelled to realistically estimate the aerodynamic loads and structural behaviours of the wind turbine. The uncertainties of the structural mass, stiffness and damping are taken into account to develop the probabilistic wind-induced demand models for the tower and blades. The dynamic behaviours of the wind turbine subjected to the simultaneous aerodynamic and sea wave loadings are investigated in a probabilistic frame and the fragility curves for both the tower and blades under the parked and operating conditions are derived and discussed.

Within the Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ), the responsibility for the monitoring of marine vertebrates belongs to the Federal Ministry for the Environment, Nature Conservation and Nuclear Safety (BMU) and the Federal Agency for Nature Conservation (BfN). The monitoring of seabirds and marine mammals is performed by means of different line transect methods. The following monitoring techniques have been applied: ship and aircraft observer- based methods as well as airborne digital monitoring methods. So far, most of the vertebrate monitoring in German waters has been performed by means of the airborne observer-based method. The great advantage of this method is that large marine areas can be surveyed in a time and cost-efficient manner. With the expansion of offshore wind farms in the German North Sea and the Baltic, this monitoring method has been banned from offshore wind farm areas due to safety concerns of the low altitudes required to perform them effectively. Aircraft-based digital monitoring methods represent a safe alternative for monitoring tasks in these areas since they can take place from a higher altitude and thus the collision risk with wind turbines can be mitigated. Currently, a range of digital camera systems as well as different image analysis processes are used to monitor seabirds and marine mammals within German offshore wind farm areas. The comparatively new digital monitoring methods are not yet calibrated. A comparative analysis of the different monitoring methods as well as the determination of calibration factors represents an important first step towards comparability of the different methods. This is necessary to ensure a consistent assessment of ecologically important species groups.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Christian Albrechts Univ Kiel CAU, Forschungs & Technol Zentrum FTZ, Busum, D-25761, Germany",,,,2020-01-01,ZOOREC:ZOOR15906033566,,

Offshore wind farms may pose direct risks to seabirds at protected breeding sites. However, changes in food availability may influence foraging behaviour and habitat use during the breeding season or between years. Consequently, seabird-wind farm interactions, and risks posed to populations, may vary over longer time scales, but this has seldom been quantified. We used GPS-telemetry to study the movements of 25 lesser black-backed gulls from the Aide-Ore Special Protection Area (SPA), UK between 2010 and 2012, while birds were associated with their breeding colony. Variation in movements away from the colony, offshore, and in operational, consented and proposed Offshore Wind Farm Areas (OWFAs) was investigated: (1) between years and (2) across the breeding season, addressing: (3) sex-specific, (4) individual and (5) diurnal/nocturnal differences. The extent of overlaps with OWFAs varied between years, being greatest in 2010 (7/10 birds showing connectivity; area overlap: 6.2 +/- 7.1%; time budget overlap: 4.6 +/- 6.2%) and least in 2012. Marine habitats close to the colony were used before breeding. Birds spent little time offshore as incubation commenced, but offshore usage again peaked during the early chick-rearing period, corresponding with use of OWFAs. Individuals differed in their seasonal interactions with OWFAs between years, and males used OWFAs significantly more than females later in the breeding season. This study demonstrates the importance of tracking animals over longer periods, without which impact assessments may incorrectly estimate the magnitude of risks posed to protected populations.

The piles and hard substrate surrounding these piles creates new habitat for species with preference to hard substrates. We studied the impact of this hard substrate on the fish community in a Dutch OWF in the sandy southern North Sea, which had been in operation for five years. Multi-mesh gillnets were placed near the OWF structures on the hard substrate protection revetments and on the sandy bottom in the middle of the farm. The catches indicated attraction of cod, pouting, bullrout and edible and velvet crab, while attraction to the sandy habitat was shown for flatfish and whiting. Further, two species previously not caught in this area, goldsinny wrasse and grey trigger fish, were caught on the hard substrate. In addition a Dual-Frequency Identification Sonar (DIDSON) was used to record transects through the farm to observe individual fish in the water column throughout the farm and very near the OWF structures. High abundances of fish near the structure were observed during some days, while during other days equal distribution of fish in the area was observed. The area around the structures is thus only used temporarily for shelter or feeding. The DIDSON also allowed looking at the aggregation level of the fish. Seasonally the aggregation level differed most likely due to different species occurring in the area. In April, most fish were aggregated in schools, while in summer most observations were individual fish or loose aggregations. The wind farm structures had limited effect on the aggregation level compared to season or weather conditions. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Such foundations require examples of near surface weathering illustrating both glacial and periglacial Quaternary processes as well as lithology and tectonic structure of the Chalk. From the Cenomanian to Early Campanian, the coast of East Yorkshire illustrates hard, high density, glacially eroded chalks similar to those found immediatdy offshore. Higher in the Campanian offshore East Yorkshire, younger, low density chalks, not present onshore, have been found (the Westermost Rough Member). In contrast, north Norfolk and its coastal cliffs provide examples of soft, high porosity, part glacially and part periglacially weathered chalks. Complex sedimentary structures seen in offshore seismic sections are similar to those on the French coast of the Pays de Caux. These coastal sections are compared with results from offshore wind farm ground investigations. Seismic sections illustrate Quaternary channels cutting into the Chalk and a landscape of hills and valleys similar to the onshore Wolds. High resolution 2D digital seismic sections, combined with cored boreholes, provide the evidence for applying the detailed Chalk lithostratigraphy to the offshore southern North Sea and illustrate the relationship between tectonic structure and sedimentation in the Chalk. The map for the offshore extension of Chalk provinces is revised, with Transitional Province lithologies typical of the Chiltern Hills and East Anglia, extending north-eastwards from Norfolk into the Dowsing Fault zone.

However, these data are frequently lacking, making simple algorithms, which require little data, appealing. Because of their simplicity, these algorithms often rely on implicit assumptions, some of which may be quite restrictive. Potential Biological Removal (PBR) is a simple harvest model that estimates the number of additional mortalities that a population can theoretically sustain without causing population extinction. However, PBR relies on a number of implicit assumptions, particularly around density dependence and population trajectory that limit its applicability in many situations. Among several uses, it has been widely employed in Europe in Environmental Impact Assessments (EIA), to examine the acceptability of potential effects of offshore wind farms on marine bird populations. As a case study, we use PBR to estimate the number of additional mortalities that a population with characteristics typical of a seabird population can theoretically sustain. We incorporated this level of additional mortality within Leslie matrix models to test assumptions within the PBR algorithm about density dependence and current population trajectory. Our analyses suggest that the PBR algorithm identifies levels of mortality which cause population declines for most population trajectories and forms of population regulation. Consequently, we recommend that practitioners do not use PBR in an EIA context for offshore wind energy developments. Rather than using simple algorithms that rely on potentially invalid implicit assumptions, we recommend use of Leslie matrix models for assessing the impact of additional mortality on a population, enabling the user to explicitly define assumptions and test their importance.

To address this, an online survey was undertaken with recreational anglers around the UK (n=199). Respondents represented a range of sodo-demographic and angling characteristibs, although male, more frequent and older fishers as well as club members were over-represented compared to a 2012 national survey. One quarter of the respondents had fished around the perimeter of or within an OWF, most on multiple occasions, and 73% of those who had not expressed a willingness to do so in future. Anglers reported both positive and negative effects on catch success when fishing near or within OWFs compared to their experiences of the same site prior to OWF development. Outcomes for individual species were also mixed. Anglers recognised the potential artificial reef effects of OWFs and their role as a safe haven, particularly due to the exclusion of commercial fishers. Negative perceptions included restricted access, harm to marine wildlife, and visual impact.

The results underline the value of large-scale and long-term assessments considering seasonal variation throughout the yearly cycle.

Moreover, the centrifugal stiffness generated by the rotating blades can increase the stiffness and natural frequencies of the blades, which in turn can further affect the structural responses. The lumped mass model, therefore, may lead to inaccurate structural response estimations. On the other hand, monopile, a long hollow steel member inserting into the water and sea bed, is generally designed as the foundation of an offshore wind turbine.

The success of the 'rigs to reefs' programme in the Gulf of Mexico has generated some interest in adopting a similar policy on some scale in the North Sea. How this may be achieved following OSPAR 98/3 is reviewed. Studies on the aggregations of fish species have estimated that less than 1.3% of North Sea saithe stocks and less than 0.25% of North Sea cod stocks are associated with oil and gas structures. There is evidence to suggest that fish associated with platforms grow and taste better than off-platform fish, even though very small elevations in hydrocarbon contamination have been detected. Whole ecosystem-based modelling approaches to fishery management indicate that total protection or regeneration of stocks is achieved only through significant area closures to the fishery. The present area closed to the fishery is already maintaining the North Sea fishery status quo. Converting existing structures into offshore reefs is considered unlikely to increase the present area of fishery exclusion nor improve its productivity, even if it was possible under OSPAR 98/3. There has been some speculation of a reef-dominated exclusion zone, whereby the reefs act as a central attractive feature. Bringing the structures inshore for reef construction may have localised positive socio-economic impacts for coastal communities, but achieves no financial benefit for the production industries and does not remove any long-term liability. Without significant levels of state support, both in the fields of construction and liability replacement, a programme of converting rigs into reefs will be difficult to achieve in the context of the North Sea.",,,,,,,,,14,0,0,0,8,0,14,,,0141-0814,,,,,,,,,,,"Dunstaffnage Marine Res Lab, Scottish Assoc Marine Sci, Oban PA37 1QA, Argyll, ScotlandHeriot Watt Univ, Int Ctr Isl Technol, Stromness KW16 3AW, Orkney, Scotland",,,,2002-06-01,WOS:000223079800009,,

Partial wake shading is considered for wake steering control and full wake shading is considered for induction control. An ambient wind speed of 8m/s is used and a representative sea state is selected. The test cases are defined based on different blade pitch and yaw angles of the upstream turbine. Power generation of the offshore wind farm is studied under different test cases. A decouped analysis approach is used to investigate drivetrain response. Global responses are obtained from FAST.Farm. These loads are used as input of the 10 MW wind turbine drivetrain model for the gears and bearings load response analysis. Results show that both induction and wake steering control lead to a limited increase in power generation of the wind farm.

The two main issues regarding offshore wind farms and birds are disturbance and collision risk. We studied the effect of wind turbines on the flight behaviour of wintering common eiders Somateria mollissima in order to identify the properties that cause disturbance and the factors that may increase their risk of collision.2. The study was conducted at Tuno Knob offshore wind park in the Kattegat, Denmark. We attracted birds though the use of decoys located at increasing distances from the wind park. To discriminate between the potential disturbance effect of the standing towers from that of the revolving rotor blades, wind turbines were switched on or off alternately during 10 experimental trials.3. Common eiders reacted strongly to the presence of wind turbines. The number of flying birds was significantly related to flight corridor location and position of the decoy group. That behavioural reaction was interpreted to be a consequence of their high speed and low-manoeuvrability flight occurring within the vertical height range of the wind turbines. The number of landing birds also reacted to the position of the decoy group in relation to proximity to the turbines, with the greatest effects observed within the wind park. Such avoidance behaviour might decrease use of otherwise suitable habitat.4. The movement and noise of rotors affected neither the number of common eiders flying within corridors nor the number of birds reacting to decoys. This suggests that the avoidance behaviour observed was caused by the presence of the structures themselves and that eiders use vision when avoiding human-made structures.5. Synthesis and applications. This study has demonstrated that common eiders avoid flying close to or into the Tuno Knob wind park. This behaviour may result in a reduction in habitat availability within and around wind parks, and raises concerns about the possible impact of the extensive development of large-scale wind parks in shallow offshore waters, which are the main feeding areas for sea ducks and other marine birds. Our results indicate that the disturbance effect of revolving rotor blades is negligible during daylight hours but highlights the need for studies to be carried out during hours of darkness and conditions of poor visibility (e.g. fog and snow). Until more insight is gained, we recommend caution when planning wind parks in areas of high sea duck densities.",,,,,,,,,87,0,0,0,70,0,108,,,0021-8901,1365-2664,,,,,,,,,,"Natl Environm Res Inst, Dept Coastal Zone Ecol, DK-8410 Ronde, Denmark",,,,2007-06-01,WOS:000246621700006,,

We present one of the first studies to quantify the indirect impact of wind farms on insectivorous bats in tropical hotspots of biodiversity. Bat activity was compared between wind farm sites and control sites, via ultrasound recordings at stationary points. The activity of bent winged bats (Miniopterus sp.) and wattled bats (Chalinolobus sp.) were both significantly lower at wind turbine sites. The result of the study demonstrates a large effect on bat habitat use at wind turbines sites compared to control sites. Bat activity was 20 times higher at control sites compared to wind turbine sites, which suggests that habitat loss is an important impact to consider in wind farm planning We strongly recommend that the loss of the foraging habitat loss is considered in mitigation hierarchy (avoiding, reducing, offsetting) when compensating for negative impacts of wind farms.",,,,,,,,,26,1,0,0,17,0,29,,,0925-8574,1872-6992,,,,,,,,,,"IAC Inst Agron Neo Caledonien, Equipe ARBOREAL Agr Biodiversite & Valorisat, BP 73, Port Laguerre 98890, Paita, New CaledoniaMuseum Natl Hist Nat, Ctr Ecol & Sci Conservat, UMR MNHN CNRS 7204, Paris, FranceStn Biol Marine, Pl Croix, F-29900 Concarneau, France",IAC Inst Agron Neo CaledonienStn Biol Marine,,,2018-03-01,WOS:000424938300007,,

Significant experience with this technology exists in the oil and gas industry, although these platforms are typically located in deeper water with predominantly clay soils. Therefore, research is required to transfer the existing knowledge. This paper discusses a series of centrifuge tests that investigate the installation and the load transfer mechanisms governing the response of suction caissons embedded in dense sand subjected to vertical cyclic loading. The effect of potential loosening of the internal soil plug during suction installation on the inservice foundation performance is evaluated through cone penetration tests inside the caisson following suction installation at different pumping flow rates. In accompanying tests, the load displacement behaviour in response to vertical cyclic loading is investigated, including significant excursions into tension. The results identify the pore fluid behaviour as the key factor affecting the response, with the pumping flow rate applied during installation being less influential.

Amphibalanus reticulatus settlement was greater at 2 than at 7 m and decreased with distance from shore at rates of -2.0 to -86.2 ind. m(-2) d(-1) km(-1), depending on depth and year. A. reticulatus growth rates were greater closer to shore, at 2 vs. 7 m, and in 2016 vs. 2015. Height growth ranged from 0.02 to 0.13 mm d(-1), but width growth was not associated with any variables. A. reticulatus total and tissue weight gains were similar to growth rates and ranged from 0.43-8.17 and 0.13-1.82 mg d(-1), respectively. The ratio of tissue to total weight was greater in 2016 than 2015 and was similar for smaller barnacles, regardless of distance. However, distance had a strong negative effect on this ratio for larger barnacles and peaked at similar to 25 to 30%. Greater barnacle settlement and growth rates in near-shore waters suggest that prolific primary and secondary production translate to increased production of fouling organisms. Moreover, greater barnacle production at 2 than at 7 m depth suggests the vertical dimension of platforms is an important aspect of their ecological value.",,,,,,,,,11,0,0,0,8,0,12,,,0171-8630,1616-1599,,,,,,,,,,"Louisiana State Univ, Dept Oceanog & Coastal Sci, 1002-Y Energy Coast & Environm Bldg, Baton Rouge, LA 70803 USALouisiana Univ Marine Consortium, 8124 Hwy 56, Chauvin, LA 70344 USAFish & Wildlife Res Inst, Florida Fish & Wildlife Conservat Commiss, 100 8th Ave Southeast, St Petersburg, FL 33701 USA",Louisiana Univ Marine Consortium,,,2018-04-16,WOS:000428817200009,,

It considered the prospects that this kind of structure could hold for exploiting wind resources in the windiest sea areas along the coasts of Italy (Sardinia, Sicily, Apulia). A review of the various types of floating structure that have been devised worldwide for wind turbines has made it possible to single out the floating structure that looks most interesting from the technical and economic standpoint. Specifically, the selected structure is of the Tension Leg Platform (TLP) type. It consists of a nearly fully submerged hexagonal platform, which carries a 6 MW wind turbine and is linked to the sea bottom by 6 ties, which assure stability and limited tilting, even under the worst loads induced by wind and sea. The construction and installation phases for this structure have been analysed, and the most effective and economically viable techniques chosen. With a view for avoiding the use of expensive sea craft, the floating structure has been designed in such a way that it can be towed to its site with the wind turbine already standing on it.A preliminary dimensioning of the floating structure has been carried out, along with technical verification of the main structural members. This work has been performed in cooperation with the engineering company TECON, which used, among others, the MOSES computation code by Ultramarine. Attention has also been devoted to the most suitable options for mooring the floating structure to the sea bottom.To assess the behaviour of the floating system under the action of wind and waves, the computational code (BM) has been developed by ERSE. This code takes into account the whole wind turbine + floating platform system, represented by a scheme featuring 8 degrees of freedom. Using this code no anomalous or unexpected behaviours were observed. The costs of building and installing this floating system have been calculated, drawing on experience gained with similar offshore structures in the oil and gas fields. The unique conditions of Italy as regards shipyards, harbours, electrical grid layout etc. have been taken into account.

Coastal populations stand to benefit greatly from reduced costs of offshore wind farms, which are one of the fastest growing and most economical sources of marine renewable energy. A considerable drawback of offshore wind power is the high cost of operations and maintenance (O&M), which can account for 25-50% of total energy production costs. Present-day maintenance procedures, using crew transfer vessels, rely on the significant wave height (H-s) as the limiting factor by which to decide whether or not it is safe to access the offshore turbines. In practice, Hs has to be applied conservatively, thus raising the costs through increased downtime. A method is proposed here with the objective of reducing overall costs through improved analysis of the motion of the crew transfer vessels (CTVs) used to transport repair technicians onto offshore wind turbine structures. CTV motion depends on the hydrodynamic forces incident on the vessel under operating conditions and the effect that the presence of the turbine has on the flow field. A change in the hydrodynamic field caused by the turbine monopile can cause a vessel abutted against the turbine support column to lose frictional contact and slip. Using the open-source computational fluid dynamics software, OpenFOAM, and in situ experimental results, the diffracted surface elevation and a wave kinematics model for the near-wake of a turbine monopile are presented. More accurate estimates of significant wave height and wave kinematics incident on a vessel close to a turbine monopile will facilitate much improved analysis of vessel motions under operational conditions.

Further, wind power plants constitute habitats for a number of organisms, and may locally alter assemblage composition and biomass of invertebrates, algae and fish. In this study, fouling assemblages on offshore wind turbines were compared to adjacent hard substrate. Influences of the structures on the seabed were also investigated. The turbines differed significantly from adjacent boulders in terms of assemblage composition of epibiota and motile invertebrates. Species number and Shannon-Wiener diversity were, also, significantly lower on the wind power plants. It was also indicated that the turbines might have affected assemblages of invertebrates and algae on adjacent boulders. Off shore wind power plant offer atypical substrates for fouling assemblages in terms of orientation, depth range, structure, and surface texture. Some potential ecological implications of the addition of these non-natural habitats for coastal ecology are discussed. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

The risk of seabirds colliding with offshore wind turbines is influenced by flight height, and flight height data usually come from observers on boats, making estimates in daylight in fine weather. GPS tracking provides an alternative and generates flight height information in a range of conditions, but the raw data have associated error. Here, we present a novel analytical solution for accommodating GPS error. We use Bayesian state-space models to describe the flight height distributions and the error in altitude measured by GPS for lesser black-backed gulls and great skuas, tracked throughout the breeding season. We also examine how location and light levels influence flight height. Lesser black-backed gulls flew lower by night than by day, indicating that this species would be less likely to encounter turbine blades at night, when birds' ability to detect and avoid them might be reduced. Gulls flew highest over land and lowest near the coast. For great skuas, no significant relationships were found between flight height, time of day and location. We consider four collision risk windows', corresponding to the airspace swept by rotor blades for different offshore wind turbine designs. We found the highest proportion of birds at risk for a 22-250 m turbine (up to 9% for great skuas and 34% for lesser black-backed gulls) and the lowest for a 30-258m turbine. Our results suggest lesser black-backed gulls are at greater risk of collision than great skuas, especially by day.Synthesis and applications. Our novel modelling approach is an effective way of resolving the error associated with GPS tracking data. We demonstrate its use on GPS measurements of altitude, generating important information on how breeding seabirds use their environment. This approach and the associated data also provide information to improve avian collision risk assessments for offshore wind farms.

J,,,,,,,,,Thomas Wilding,,Improving marine growth estimates using 3D photogrammetry,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Awarded Grant,Jan 01 2018,2018,"Offshore infrastructure, including oil and gas and renewables installations, are rapidly colonised by a diverse range of animals and plants (seaweeds), here referred to as 'marine growth'. The nature and extent of marine growth has both engineering and ecological consequences for the performance and integrity of offshore infrastructure. From an engineering perspective, marine growth changes critical structure characteristics affecting performance at both the operational (e.g. drag and loading forces) and decommissioning phases (e.g. jacket lifting/towing). From an ecological perspective, marine growth is the basis for the 'reef-effect' offered by offshore structures; marine growth provides ecosystem services such as water filtration, food provision and shelter (e.g. for commerical fish species). The scale of offshore energy, and the associated installation and removal of structures, is considerable and includes the commissioning of new wind-farms (up to 50,000 wind-turbines are projected by 2050 in Europe) and decommissioning of oil and gas structures (>20% of North Sea assets to be decommissioned within 10 years). Industry needs to monitor four aspects of the marine growth (MG) on their installations. These aspects are marine growth type (e.g. mussels, coral, anemones) mass, volume and surface roughness. Accurate estimation of these aspects is required in order to (1) inform engineering decisions that account for effects of marine growth, (2) optimise cleaning regimes and planning, (3) inform lifting operations at decommissioning and (4) organise disposal of the marine growth. Marine growth estimates are also required to understand the ecosystem-services offered by offshore structures and thus the environmental consequences of installing and removing infrastructure. This information is also required by regulators and policy-makers as an evidence base to optimise decision-making with respect to consenting offshore activities. Currently, industry employs a simple algorithm to estimate marine growth thickness and mass on their structures. This algorithm frequently results in substantial overestimates (up to a factor of 20) between predicted and reported MG mass. The current poor MG estimates result in a high degree of uncertainty, for example in the equipment necessary to lift a structure, and this uncertainty incurs considerable costs. Our project will build on on-going research to assess the feasibility of generating, and analysing, 3D images derived from video footage obtained using remotely operated vehicles (ROV). We will calibrate the MG volume estimated from the ROV-3D images against different MG categories (seaweed, hard-growth, such as mussels, and soft-growth, such as sponges and anemones). We will then take ROV footage gathered around oil and gas structures that have subsequently been decommissioning, and cleaned, and compare our new MG estimates against those recorded by the decommissioning yard. This feasibility assessment will culminate in the production of best-practice guidelines to industry for optimal methods to generate and use 3D images in assessing MG. The knowledge embedded in end-users organisations, as result of this project, will steer adoption of 3D imaging as a novel marine growth assessment tool.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,NE/R014698/1,,,,,,,,Scottish Association For Marine Science,Scottish Association For Marine Science,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:15342489,,

Thirteen species of scleractinian corals inhabit these structures, and a positive association is known to exist between reef-associated fishes and coral. Here, we studied 22 platforms on the Mississippi River delta, an area devoid of natural reefs. We quantified the abundance of reef-associated fishes on platforms occurring in 19-334 m depths. We recorded 18 reef-associated fish species, most commonly Stegastes leucostictus (Muller and Troschel, 1848), Stegastes partitus (Poey, 1868), Abudefduf saxatilis (Linnaeus, 1758), Abudefduf taurus (Muller and Troschel, 1848), and Chromis multilineata (Guichenot, 1853). In water depths >= 25 m, average fish densities ranged from 1.0 to 15.3 m(-2). No reef-associated fishes were observed on structures in < 25 m water depth. Individual sample densities ranged from 0 to 32 m(-2). Average fish densities peaked on the platforms at depths of 18-36 m. At > 66 m depth, the fish densities dropped to zero. Average coral densities per platform in waters > 30 m deep ranged from 0.4 to 173.0 colonies m(-2). Individual sample densities ranged from 0 to 945.0 colonies m(-2). There was a significant positive correlation between average reef-associated fish density and bottom water depth. There was also a positive correlation between average fish density and average coral density. The data indicated that coral and fish densities were lower in inshore waters. These waters are generally characterized by low salinity, low winter seawater temperatures, high turbidity, and high nutrient levels. Our data showed that the fish community is linked to the coral community, as is known to occur on natural reefs.

Once production ceases, decommissioning options for the platform are assessed. The role that a platform's jacket plays as fish habitat can inform the decommissioning decision. In this study, conducted along the crossbeams of a California platform jacket and using an ROV, we compared estimates of fish diversity and densities determined from a targeted biological survey with those from a replicated structural survey. We found that the water column fish species assemblages characterized by the two methods were similar. By contrast, the two survey methods yielded different species assemblages inhabiting the crossbeam at the platform jacket base. This difference occurred because, at least off California, the platform jacket base species diversity tends to be highest where the bottom crossbeam is undercut, creating sheltering sites for many species. Because the structural method inadequately imaged the seafloor-crossbeam interface, particularly where a gap occurred between crossbeam and seafloor, substantial numbers of fishes were not visible. While we cannot extrapolate from this study to all platforms' worldwide, it is clear that routine platform structural integrity surveys may be a valuable source for opportunistic marine community surveys. Intentional planning of the structural survey to incorporate relatively minor variations (e.g., maintaining fixed ROV distance from the infrastructure and consistent 90 degrees camera angle) coupled with a deliberate consideration of the platform ecology (e.g., positioning the ROV to capture the seafloor-crossbeam interface) can substantially improve the effects on fish assemblage assessments from routine structural surveys without compromising the integrity assessment. We suggest that these biases should be both acknowledged and, understood when using routine structural surveys to inform platform ecology assessment. Additional consideration may be given to structural surveys that incorporate incremental adjustments to provide better data applicability to biological assessments.",,,,,,,,,6,0,0,0,2,0,6,,,1932-6203,,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Inst Marine Sci, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USAExxonMobil Upstream Res Co, Spring, TX USA",,,,2020-12-11,WOS:000592383400009,33170883,

A numerical method is used to investigate Tension Leg Platform (TLP) offshore wind turbine response behavior under a parked condition. This code considers nonlinearities due to changes in the tension of tethers. The off-diagonal components of stiffness, damping and mass matrices are considered to calculate coupling. This code solves the nonlinear equation of motion at each time step. However, in order to validate the data generated by the code, a scaled-down model was fully tested in the marine laboratory. The importance of these series of experiments is due to the fact that this model possesses a unique design and specifications to which no other model can be compared. Measurement of three degrees of freedom under environmental load is the goal of the experiments. Also, the results clearly show that the direction of encountering waves is an extremely important factor. It can be concluded that wind loads can dampen the oscillation of the model and prevent the impact of large loads on the tethers. The results show that the discrepancy between experimental and numerical results, with different degrees of freedom, is sufficiently acceptable. (C) 2014 Sharif University of Technology.

Rotational springs with a stiffness equated to the tangent or secant modulus characterized soil resistance to acentric loads. The procedure was implemented in X-SEA program.

The behaviors of a five MW offshore wind turbine system in South Korea were examined by considering waves, current, wind effects, and marine growth. In a free vibration analysis done with soil stiffness through the API method, the piles were found to bend in their first mode and to twist in the second and third modes, whereas the first three modes using Jeanjean's method were all found to twist. The natural frequencies resulting from Jeanjean's method were higher than those from the API method.

Offshore wind energy sector has been clearly the fastest in its development among other options, and development of new wind farms requires large ocean space. Therefore, there is a need of efficient spatial planning process, including the site selection constrained by technical (wind resource, coastal distance, seafloor) and environmental (impacts) factors and competence of uses. We present a novel approach, using Bayesian Belief Networks (BBN), for an integrated spatially explicit site feasibility identification for offshore wind farms. Our objectives are to: (i) develop a spatially explicit model that integrates the technical, economic, environmental and social dimensions; (ii) operationalize the BBN model; (iii) implement the model at local (Basque Country) and regional (North East Atlantic and Western Mediterranean), and (iv) develop and analyse future scenarios for wind farm installation in a local case study. Results demonstrated a total of 1% (23 km(2)) of moderate feasibility areas in local scaled analysis, compared to 4% of (21,600 km(2)) very high, and 5% (30,000 km(2)) of high feasibility in larger scale analysis. The main challenges were data availability and discretization when trying to expand the model from local to regional level. The use of BBN models to determine the feasibility of offshore wind farm areas has been demonstrated adequate and possible, both at local and regional scales, allowing managers to take management decisions regarding marine spatial planning when including different activities, environmental problems and technological constraints.

Methodological approaches have included surveys by underwater visual censuses around and under oil platforms and along the docking area of rigs at the Port of Las Palmas. Eleven non-native fish species were registered. Paranthias furcifer, Abudefduf hoefleri, Acanthurus bahianus, Acanthurus chirurgus, and Acanthurus coeruleus are first recorded from the Canaries herein. Other three species could not be identified, although they have never been observed in the Canaries. Cephalopholis taeniops, Abudefduf saxatilis, and Acanthurus monroviae had been previously recorded. Native areas of these species coincide with the areas of origin and the scale of oil rigs with destination the Port of Las Palmas. The absence of native species in the censuses at rigs and their presence at rigs docking area, together with the observation of non-native species after the departure of platforms, reject the possibility that these non-native species were already present in the area introduced by another vector. C taeniops, A. hoefleri, A. saxatilis, A. chirurgus, A. coeruleus and A. monroviae are clearly seafarer species. A. bahianus seems to be a potential seafarer species.

In 1986, Louisiana became the first state to create an artificial reef program under the guidance of National Fishing Enhancement Act and authorization of the Louisiana Fishing Enhancement Act. Currently, LARP has created over 83 artificial reef sites using over 120 decommissioned platforms. Operators that donate a platform as an artificial reef can often lower the cost of decommissioning below the cost to bring the platform to shore for disposal. Many factors are involved in the decision to convert a rig into a reef, and subsequently, the cost savings associated with reefing. The purpose of this paper is to describe the regulatory background of LARP, to discuss the nature of the cost savings associated with reef donation, and to derive quantitative relations that predict the donation amount based on characteristics of the structure. The frequency of rig donations as a function of water depth and planning area are provided, and regression models of the donation are developed based on the structure size, water depth, removal method, and proximity of the platform to the permitted reef site. Priorities for future research are also identified. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

The use of Underwater Visual Census (UVC) by SCUBA divers is predominant; however, remotely acquired video data (e.g., cameras systems, remotely operated vehicles (ROVs), submersibles) are becoming more frequently used to acquire community data. Both remote and diver-based surveys are currently used to survey artificial reef habitat in the Northwestern Gulf of Mexico (GOM) and have associated error due to inherent method bias. Because survey methods that most accurately document the occurrence and estimated abundance of several important fisheries species are greatly needed in the GOM, we compared data collected on the same days and sites from both Roving Diver Surveys (RDS) and micro-ROV surveys conducted on reefed oil and gas platforms. The combined datasets identified a total of 56 species from 22 families, and there was no significant difference in measured species richness between a comprehensive 30 min ROV survey and RDS. Five species of federally managed fish in the GOM were more frequently detected by ROV, as were the majority of species in the Lutjanid and Carangid families. However, abundance estimates from RDS surveys were up to an order of magnitude greater. Multivariate analyses indicated that method choice affected community composition, with Lutjanids and Carangids driving the differences. These two fish families in particular are subject to method bias, probably due to inflated abundance estimates with RDS, or alternatively, deflated estimates from ROV. Although our ROV surveys more frequently detected important fisheries species and produced conservative abundance estimates, a further examination of species distributions on these high-relief platform reefs is needed to fully determine the most accurate survey method. In addition, the attraction and/or gear avoidance of certain species to underwater vehicles deserves further investigation.

Excepting the Flower Garden Banks (FGB) and deeper mesophotic banks, no shallow hard substrate has been available offshore since the Holocene. Platforms have facilitated coral geographic expansion in this region. We determined the distribution, abundance, and species diversity patterns on 42 platforms in this region, at <= 37 m depth, along four cross-shelf transects: 1) S-SE from Corpus Christi, Texas; 2) S from Lake Sabine, Texas; 3) S from Terrebonne Bay, Louisiana; and 4) S-SW from Mobile, Alabama. Nine hermatypic, two ahermatypic, and one hydrozoan coral were found: hermatypes-Madracis decactis. Diploria strigosa, Montastraea cavernosa, Porites astreoides, Madracis formosa, Colpophyllia natans, Stephanocoenia intercepta, Stephanocoenia michelinii, and Millepora alcicornis (Hydrozoa); ahermatypes-Tubastraea cocci flea. Oculina diffusa, and Phyllangia americana. Pattern-seeking analyses identified four community types: one with no hermatypic corals (inner and mid-shelf); one high diversity set of platforms, dominated by abundant Madracis decactis, occurring with four other species per platform (outer shelf); and a third dominated by Madracis decactis, in low abundance, co-dominated by D. strigosa and Millepora alcicornis (outer shelf). Species diversity was highest around the Flower Garden Banks. Hermatypic density and D. strigosa (broadcaster) in particular, was maximum around the FGB, extending northwards. Madracis decactis (brooder) densities peaked at the shelf edge, off Terrebonne Bay, Louisiana. Montastraea cavernosa densities were bimodal, peaking near the FGB and east of the Mississippi River. The FGB appear to be the source of hermatypic corals for most platform populations. Differences between the distribution patterns of Madracis decactis and D. strigosa, Montastraea cavernosa, and O. diffusa suggest that the brooder effects longer recruitment distances by averaging larval dispersal over a broad range of hydrographic conditions throughout the year, while the broadcaster utilizes only one set of conditions over the same period. Averaging respective dispersal strategies over decades may have produced the observed disparate distribution patterns. Ahermatypic coral density exceeded hermatypic density by 10,000 fold, peaking south of Terrebonne Bay, Louisiana and Mobile, Alabama, due to T. coccinea. Ahermatypic diversity was highest off Matagorda Island, Texas, decreasing from west to east. Multi-variate pattern-seeking analysis (PATN) identified four ahermatypic community types: one dominated by O. diffusa and T. coccinea in low abundances (shelf-wide distribution); one characterized by the absence of ahermatypic corals (generally near-shore); one heavily dominated by T. coccinea, and also by O. diffusa in low abundances (mid-shelf to shelf edge); and one dominated by T. coccinea, co-dominated by both P. americana and O. diffusa in low abundances (shelf-edge). T. coccinea and P. americana appear to be derived from the southern GOM off Mexico or the Caribbean. Unlike shrinking coral populations in other parts of the world, corals have expanded their range substantially in the northern Gulf of Mexico, in areas previously devoid or near devoid of corals, facilitated by thousands of oil/gas platforms deployed for decades throughout the region.It is also possible that coral populations on these platforms may act as potential larval sources for the FGB in the event of a mass coral mortality there.

Wind farms, both operational and in planning, can be expected to impact negatively on wildlife populations, particularly birds. We propose a novel approach to assess the impacts through the energetic costs of avoidance behaviour for a long-distance, migratory seaduck. Flight trajectories were recorded using surveillance radar at a Danish offshore wind farm with emphasis placed on the 200 000+ migrating common eiders that pass through the area annually. Minimum distance to wind farm and curvature of trajectories were compared pre- and post-construction. Additional costs of the avoidance response were estimated using an avian energetic model. The curvature of eider trajectories was greatest post-construction and within 500 m of the wind farm, with a median curvature significantly greater than pre-construction, suggesting that the birds adjusted their flight paths in the presence of the wind farm. Additional distance travelled as a consequence of the wind farm's presence was ca. 500 m and trivial compared with the total costs of a migration episode of 1400 km. However, construction of further wind farms along the migration route could have cumulative effects on the population, especially when considered in combination with other human actions.",,,,,,,,,97,1,0,0,77,1,124,,,1054-3139,,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Glasgow, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Glasgow G12 8QQ, Lanark, ScotlandUniv Aarhus, Dept Wildlife Ecol & Biodivers, Natl Environm Res Inst, DK-8410 Ronde, DenmarkUniv Stirling, Beta Ctr, Stirling FK9 4NF, Scotland",,,,2009-05-01,WOS:000265096600014,,

Off the US coast, 60% of the offshore wind lies in deep water (greater than 60m) where the development of Floating Offshore Wind Turbine (FOWT) hull technology will likely be required in lieu of fixed bottom technology such as jacket structures. The United States National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) and the offshore wind community commonly refer to 60m as the transition point between fixed bottom structures and floating structures due to economic reasons. Floating wind turbines deployed in the harsh offshore marine environment require the use of materials that are cost-effective, corrosion resistant, require little maintenance and are highly durable. This has led the University of Maine to develop a concrete hull technology called VolturnUS for full-scale 6MW FOWTs. In this work, experimental testing was conducted to verify the performance of the concrete under operational, serviceability, and extreme loading conditions as required by the American Bureau of Shipping Guide for Building and Classing Floating Offshore Wind Turbines. The testing included structural testing sub-components of the hull and served as experimental verification of American Bureau of Shipping (ABS) concrete design methodology which is currently approved and being used to design the first commercial scale FOWTs in the United States. Two 6MW wind turbines supported on VolturnUS concrete hulls will be used for the New England Aqua Ventus I project.

Knowing what species exist on and around the offshore platforms and what environmental variables influence this species assemblage is crucial for a better understanding of the impact of offshore platforms on marine life. Information on this is limited for offshore platforms in the southern North Sea. This study aims to fill this gap in our knowledge and to determine how the composition and the abundance of species assemblages changes with depth and along a distance-from-shore gradient. The species assemblages on five offshore gas platforms in the southern North Sea have been inventoried using Remotely Operated Vehicles inspection footage. A total of 30 taxa were identified. A Generalised Additive Model of the species richness showed a significant non-linear relation with water depth (p = 0.001): from a low richness in shallow waters it increases with depth until 15-20 m, after which richness decreases again. Using PERMANOVA, water depth (p≤0.001), community age (p≤0.001) and the interaction between distance from shore and community age (p≤0.001) showed a significant effect on the species assemblages. Future research should focus on the effect additional environmental variables have on the species assemblages.

We compared adult densities and potential larval production of these species at platforms and natural outcrops in California. Densities of mature bocaccio and cowcod were highly variable among survey sites, but were generally very low at both natural reefs and platforms. However, the mean densities for both species were higher around platforms than at natural reefs. Two of the three platforms (Gail and Hidalgo) that harbored mature bocaccio had larger mature individuals than did any natural reef. Platform Gail had by far the highest densities of both mature bocaccio and cowcod of any natural or human-made habitat and the potential larval production of both species at Platform Gail was much higher than at any other site surveyed. We estimated the removal of Platform Gail would be the equivalent of removing 12.57 ha of average-producing natural habitat in southern California for cowcod or 29.24 ha of average-producing natural habitat for bocaccio.

Inmost areas decommissioning operations will need to be supported by environmental assessment and monitoring, potentially over the life of any structures left in place. This requirement will have a considerable cost for industry and the public. Here we review approaches for the assessment of the primary operating environments associated with decommissioning - namely structures, pipelines, cuttings piles, the general seabed environment and the water column - and show that already available marine autonomous systems (MAS) offer a wide range of solutions for this major monitoring challenge. Data of direct relevance to decommissioning can be collected using acoustic, visual, and oceanographic sensors deployed on MAS. We suggest that there is considerable potential for both cost savings and a substantial improvement in the temporal and spatial resolution of environmental monitoring. We summarise the trade-offs between MAS and current conventional approaches to marine environmental monitoring. MAS have the potential to successfully carry out much of the monitoring associated with decommissioning and to offer viable alternatives where a direct match for the conventional approach is not possible.

Particles of carbonate sands have highly porous grain structures with intra-granular voids. Such porous grain structure results in a much more compressible soil grain than terrigenous (i.e., quartz-based) sands, which have solid grain structure. As a result, calcareous sands exhibit engineering and mechanical characteristics that are different than that of quartzitic sands. While there is a significant amount of experience on the performance of foundation systems on terrigenous sediments, expanding offshore infrastructure construction on carbonate sands brings considerable challenges. This study focuses on micro-scale characterization of carbonate sands as a first step to overcome this challenge. For this purpose, nanoindentation tests were performed on ten different carbonate sand samples. Mechanical properties of carbonate sand grains were determined using nanoindentation techniques. A series of peak loads are applied by the nanoindenter on the grain surface and load-displacement curves are developed to estimate Young's modulus and hardness values of the carbonate sand grains. Modulus and hardness of the carbonate sand grains were considerably lower than those reported for quartzitic sand grains. Test results cumulatively show that modulus and hardness values of carbonate sands are highly dependent on indentation depth. Considerable softening with increasing indentation depth was observed; both the modulus and hardness values of carbonate sand grains show a significant decrease at larger indentation depths. Furthermore, high inter-sample and inter-grain variation of mechanical properties was observed.

Recently, a lot of researchers have carried out on the issue of offshore wind turbine. Because of incapability of most of software programs to simulate gyroscopic effect of rotating rotors, in this articles a significant effort has been made to fabricate and test an offshore wind turbine under different rotor rotation velocities and different heading angle of wind so as to obtain the effects of these parameters on structure responses. Study on the response of a wind turbine under environmental loads has had a notable importance due to the fact that structure behavior can strongly affect procedure of modeling and optimizing wind turbine structures. On the other hand, frequency-domain structural response of a wind turbine can also make engineers be informed about of appropriate mooring system for a special environmental condition. Consequently, it has been observed that increasing the rotor rotation velocity leads the peak of spectrums shift to a higher frequency due to the gyroscopic effect appeared as a damping term, and changing heading angle of wind may lead to a change in heave and pitch amplitudes in the time domain response, and heave, sway and surge motion in frequency response.",,,,,,,,,11,1,0,0,0,0,12,,,1735-1472,1735-2630,,,,,,,,,,"Sharif Univ Technol, Sch Mech Engn, Tehran, IranQUB, Belfast BT9 5AG, Antrim, North Ireland",QUB,,,2018-11-13,WOS:000448672700004,,

J,,,,,,,,,Santana Madabhushi,,Cyclic Behaviour of Monopile Foundations for Offshore Wind Farms,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Awarded Grant,Jun 30 2010,2010,"Offshore wind farms are gaining popularity in the UK due to the current interest in the need for greener energy sources, security of energy supply and to the public's reluctance to have wind farms on-shore. Offshore wind farms often contain hundreds of turbines supported at heights of 30m to 50m. The preferred foundations for these tall structures are large diameter monopiles due to their ease of construction in shallow to medium water depths. These monopiles are subjected to large cyclic, lateral and moment loads in addition to axial loads. It is anticipated that each of these foundations will see many millions of cycles of loading during their design life. In coastal waters around the UK, it is common for these monopiles to pass through shallow layers of soft, poorly consolidated marine clays before entering into stiffer clay/sand strata. One of the biggest concerns with the design of monopiles is their behaviour under very large numbers of cycles of lateral and moment loads. The current design methods rely heavily on stiffness degradation curves for clays available in the literature that were primarily derived for earthquake loading on relatively small diameter piles with relatively small numbers of cycles of loading. Extrapolation of this stiffness deterioration to large diameter piles with large numbers of cycles of loading represents the key risk factor in assessing the performance of offshore wind turbines. Further research is therefore required. The proposed project aims to understand the behaviour of large diameter monopiles driven through clay layers of contrasting stiffness and subjected to cyclic lateral and moment loading. Centrifuge model tests will be conducted taking advantage of recent developments at the Schofield Centre that include a computer-controlled 2-D actuator that can apply both force or displacement controlled cyclic loading to monopiles in-flight. In addition it is possible to carry out in-flight installation of the monopiles to simulate the insertion of these monopiles into the seabed. New equipment will be developed for the in-flight measurement of soil stiffness and dynamic response comparative to the state-of-the-art equipment which is now used in the field. The main outcome of the project will be a better understanding of the response of the monopiles in layered soil systems to large number of loading cycles (lateral and moment loads). The results will be directly compared to the current design practices and guidelines for improved design will be developed. The outcome of this project will allow an accurate estimation of the behaviour of offshore monopile foundations under very large numbers of cycles of loading, thus leading to a confident estimation of the life cycle of the foundation. This is critical in determining the economic viability of an offshore wind farm given that the capital costs are high and the revenue stream is relatively low but continues for the life of the wind farm.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,EP/H013857/1,,,,,,,,University of Cambridge,,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:15398710,,

There are few records of this disease in the northwestern Gulf of Mexico, a region characterized by soft muddy bottoms that are considered poor habitat for the CTX source dinoflagellate Gambierdiscus toxicus. However, the approximately 4000 petroleum production platforms and hundreds of state-sponsored artificial reefs located in the Gulf of Mexico provide hard substrate and often support coral and other components of the tropical benthos. In addition to their role in their resource extraction, these oil production platforms are also popular sites for recreational fishing and sport diving. We examined these platforms as potential substrate for G. toxicus and report a first record of this species in the NW Gulf of Mexico. All the platforms (n = 6) examined harbored the dinoflagellate as an epiphyte on the fouling community, with three finds of G. toxicus associated with the pelagic macroalga, Sargassum. Only minor toxicity (< 0.15 ppb) was noted in two of 20 great barracuda (Sphyraena barracuda) examined. Tagging data suggest trans-Gulf migrations by barracuda are common; thus, we cannot determine if the toxicity was acquired locally or transported in migrating fish.These platforms are a clear example of how human activity has altered the environment in a way that allows expansion of a HA-B population. The rapid increase in production platforms since 1942 has provided novel substrate in a sandy/muddy bottom environment generally considered to be poor habitat for these benthic dinoflagellates. These platforms create a unique habitat in the upper euphotic zone and serve as intersection points for fishermen and potentially toxic fish. Many Gulf of Mexico states have active programs to turn non-producing platforms into artificial reefs. Our results suggest that the use of these platforms as fisheries enhancement structures could have unintended consequences for human health, particularly if projected rising sea-surface temperatures over the next century alter benthic distributions and fish migration patterns. These concerns also extend to mariculture operations around oil production rigs or offshore wind farms, both of which would also add substrate for epibenthic microalgae. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

Evidence from several studies indicates that nematodes can be highly sensitive to changes in the environmental quality. Here, we investigated the response of nematode assemblages to the presence of offshore gas platforms (located in the central Mediterranean Sea) in terms of spatial heterogeneity, structural and functional diversity. Since the effect of the investigated offshore platforms on macrofaunal assemblages were previously assessed by Terlizzi et al. (2008), the study provided also the opportunity to compare the response of different benthic compartments to the same impact related to fossil fuel extraction on marine environments. The platforms had a significant impact on nematode assemblages up to 1000 m distance from the structure. The effects were evident in term of: a) more homogeneous spatial distribution of nematode assemblages, b) increased trophic diversity of deposit feeders and c) changes in life strategies with an increase of opportunistic species in sediments closer to the platforms. Such effects seemed to be related to the dimension of the platform structures, rather than to chemical pollution or changes in food availability. These findings suggest that the platforms exert a physical alteration of the surrounding environment that is reflected by altered structural and functional traits of nematode biodiversity. The use of nematodes for monitoring the effects of the platforms only partially matched with the results obtained using macrofauna, providing further insights on potential outcomes on the functional response of marine assemblages to fossil fuel extraction.

Our examination of marine communities associated with oil platforms in Gabon is the first scientific investigation of these structures and highlights the unique ecosystems associated with them. A number of species previously unknown to Gabonese waters were recorded during our surveys on these platforms. Clear distinctions in benthic communities were observed between older, larger platforms in the north and newer platforms to the south or closer to shore. The former were dominated by a solitary cup coral, Tubastraea sp., whereas the latter were dominated by the barnacle Megabalanus tintinnabulum, but with more diverse benthic assemblages compared to the northerly platforms. Previous work documented the presence of limited zooxanthellated scleractinian corals on natural rocky substrate in Gabon but none were recorded on platforms. Total estimated fish biomass on these platforms exceeded one ton at some locations and was dominated by barracuda (Sphyraena spp.), jacks (Carangids), and rainbow runner (Elagatis bipinnulata). Thirty-four percent of fish species observed on these platforms are new records for Gabon and 6% are new to tropical West Africa. Fish assemblages closely associated with platforms had distinct amphi-Atlantic affinities and platforms likely extend the distribution of these species into coastal West Africa. At least one potential invasive species, the snowflake coral (Carijoa riisei), was observed on the platforms. Oil platforms may act as stepping stones, increasing regional biodiversity and production but they may also be vectors for invasive species. Gabon is a world leader in terrestrial conservation with a network of protected areas covering >10% of the country. Oil exploration and biodiversity conservation currently co-exist in terrestrial and freshwater ecosystems in Gabon. Efforts to increase marine protection in Gabon may benefit by including oil platforms in the marine protected area design process.",,,,,,,,,81,0,0,0,66,0,86,,,1932-6203,,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Hawaii, Dept Biol, Fisheries Ecol Res Lab, Honolulu, HI 96822 USANatl Geog Soc, Pristine Seas, Washington, DC USACSIC, Ctr Estudis Avancats, Blanes, SpainWildlife Conservat Soc, Bronx, NY USA",,,,2014-08-01,WOS:000339819800069,25083704,

Fishing captures were useful for MBES targets' identification by measuring the presence/abundance of nekto-benthic and pelagic species both in the nearby of the structure and in the open sea, while drop camera shootings added evidence of a few species in close proximity to the poles, which were not censused by the other methods.

The undergraduate students will be mentored by graduate students who are themselves working in an interdisciplinary program in offshore wind energy engineering, environmental impacts, and policy. The goal of this REU is to develop well-rounded researchers at multiple levels of education and expertise, who will have the background needed to design wind energy systems that better address not only the considerable engineering challenges, but also the environmental, social, economic, and regulatory challenges. Research projects will span these wind energy challenges, and will include investigating how mooring lines work for floating offshore wind turbines, designing very large turbine blades out of biodegradable materials such as wood, investigating the offshore movements of birds and bats to carefully plan the location and operation of offshore wind farms, and understanding what drives public acceptance and rejection of offshore wind energy in Massachusetts. The project will engage a diverse community of undergraduate students to work on sustainable energy systems, an important global issue, and will encourage students to pursue graduate research in wind energy. The activities will include mentored research and leadership opportunities; technical and professional seminar series; working lunches; fieldwork and REU field trips; and an end-of-program poster session in which students present the results of their research projects.

Generally, policies mandate removal of these structures post-production; however, many enter 'Rigs-to-Reefs' (RTR) programs that convert the rig materials into artificial reefs ('reefing'). Despite the growth of RTR programs worldwide, the functionality of the resulting habitats remains uncertain, particularly due to the lack of comparative studies with natural systems. To address this data gap as it relates to trophic ecology, we compared annual, ontogenetic, and habitat-specific diet and stable isotope signatures (delta C-13 and delta N-1(5)) of adult red snapper Lutjanus campechanus (n = 1585) from relic coralgal natural reefs to those of fish from standing and reefed platforms located in similar depth strata of the northwestern GOM. Stomach content analyses revealed significant effects of year, habitat, and total length on prey composition. Subsequent analyses of stable isotope values by size class identified a non-linear relationship with ontogeny. delta C-13 and delta N-15 values at reefed platforms and natural reefs decreased in the medium size class (401-600 mm total length), whereas fish from standing platforms exhibited more consistent feeding patterns across ontogeny. Annual variability was also observed in delta C-13 and delta N-15 values, with 2013 and 2014 significantly different from 2015. These findings suggest that the trophic impacts of habitat type on reef fishes are more complex than previously considered in the GOM and that reefed platforms provide foraging opportunities more similar to natural reefs than standing platforms.",,,,,,,,,7,0,0,0,7,0,7,,,0171-8630,1616-1599,,,,,,,,,,"Florida Atlantic Univ, Harbor Branch, Oceanog Inst, 5600 US Highway 1 North, Ft Pierce, FL 34946 USATexas A&M Univ, Harte Res Inst Gulf Mexico Studies, 6300 Ocean Dr, Corpus Christi, TX 78412 USA",,,,2020-04-07,WOS:000521737900009,,

One approach to the problem is inviting the local fishermen to the management of the wind farm. It requires higher economic performance of the wind farm than the original fishing activity in the same sea surface area.The proposed concept is the combination of a floating wind turbine and counter-rotating water current turbine. The water current turbine partially cancels the reaction torque of electric generator and provides additional energy production from water current. The rotating axis of the turbine is not fixed in the upright position to reduce the size of supporting structure. Regular maintenance work is only in low altitude on the float.

J,,,,,,,,,"Shen, Lian",,Computation of marine atmospheric boundary layer and nonlinear ocean wavefield for energy for sustainability,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Awarded Grant,Mar 18 2013,2013,"1133700 PI Shen This project is focused on establishing a computational framework for ocean winds and waves that can be applied to renewable energy applications such as an offshore wind farm and a wave power generator. The simulation tool builds on several recent developments in computational fluid dynamics and hydrodynamics, including a high-order spectral method for waves, large-eddy simulation on a wave surface-fitted grid for wind turbulence, and a hybrid multi-fluid simulation for steep and breaking waves. Using high-performance computing on massively parallel computers, the PI plans to resolve the spatial and temporal details of the wave and wind fields and provide valuable information for wind and wave energy applications. The tasks of the project are to: (i) Develop advanced numerical capability for the wavephase-resolving simulation of ocean wave and wind motions. (ii) Use the wind?wave simulation tool to obtain a better understanding of the ocean wind and wave fields as resources for sustainable energy. (iii) Apply the simulation tool to applications in offshore wind farms, and explore the extension to wave energy harvesting. The PI will improve the simulation and prediction capabilities for offshore winds and waves that are particularly useful for the study of offshore renewable energy. The proposed simulation approach, which considers the full coupling between wind turbulence and nonlinear ocean waves and resolves the details of wave phases, is the first of its kind and possesses an advantage over traditional wave-phase-averaging simulation methods. The application to the simulation of marine atmospheric boundary layer with wind turbine arrays will help answer many scientific and engineering questions related to the development of offshore wind farms. The simulations, with the wave phases resolved, will also be valuable for the understanding of nonlinear wave dynamics and will be helpful for the design of wave energy converters. Broader impacts: The topic of this study, sustainable energy from offshore winds and waves, is of great interest to the scientific community as well as the general public. The simulation tool developed in this project will have direct applications in offshore wind and wave energy harvesting. It can be used for the mapping of renewable energy resources, site selection of wind farms, optimization of wind turbine array arrangements, and operation of wind turbines and wave energy devices in various sea environments. Doctoral graduate education will stress multi-disciplinary training with a focus on modeling multiscale and multi-physics problems. Recruiting of domestic graduate students will leverage an existing NSF IGERT project. The IGERT project focuses on the training in scientific modeling and computation for Ph.D. students in their first two years of study. The project will lead to natural continuation for an IGERT trainee for the remaining three years of Ph.D. study. Ongoing outreach to local Baltimore high schools will be actively continued by providing research experiences for high school students, especially under-represented minorities.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,1341062,,,,,,,,University of Minnesota-Twin Cities,,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:13836189,,

To allow a more cost-effective design and prevent the occurrence of unscheduled maintenance, it is highly desirable to mitigate severe fatigue loading conditions and constantly monitor the dynamic behavior that the tower exhibits during operation. This paper sought to understand whether state-of-the-art control techniques for tower load reduction might be coupled with an online time frequency analysis of tower vibrations, in order to extend the ongoing research effort in the area of situation control. Therefore, we performed hydro-aero-elastic simulation for a commercial 5MW offshore wind turbine, for two different sets of wind-sea conditions; simulations were iterated for three alternative control scenarios: baseline control, conventional tower control and advanced tower control. Results showed how the proposed method was able to reduce fatigue loads, without severely impairing pitch actuators, as is the case with classic state-of-the-art tower control methods.

These artificial structures provide a number of ecological functions including habitat provision for epibenthic invertebrates and production of food and refuge for a variety of fish species. To mitigate the loss of habitat when active platforms are decommissioned, Rigs-to-Reefs programs maintain existing communities by removing the upper 26 m of platform structure and converting upper and lower portions into artificial reefs. We examined the epibenthic communities of two standing platforms at 5 m and 30 m depths and three reefed platforms at 30 m depths. A combination of stable isotope and community analysis was used to assess the structure and food web functioning of epibenthic communities among these site-types. Reefed platforms (30 m) supported communities with similar food web structure as 5 m and 30 in standing platform communities. However, community composition in standing platform and reefed platform sites at 30 m differed from those of standing platform sites at 5 m depths. Results indicate that, although loss of shallow water habitat associated with platform reefing may diminish some aspects of biodiversity, reefed platforms support similar fundamental ecological functions as standing platforms in the Gulf of Mexico. Thus, the current reefing practice of removal of the upper 26 m of the structure does not substantially influence the functionality of these systems, and the retained structure maintains beneficial habitat for epibenthic communities.",,,,,,,,,5,0,0,0,5,0,5,,,0079-6611,1873-4472,,,,,,,,,,"Texas A&M Univ Corpus Christi, Dept Life Sci, 6300 Ocean Dr, Corpus Christi, TX 78412 USAUniv La Rochelle, UMR 7266 Littoral Environm & Soc, Inst Littoral & Environm, CNRS, 2 Rue Olympe de Gouges, F-17000 La Rochelle, FranceTexas A&M Univ Corpus Christi, Harte Res Inst Gulf Mexico Studies, 6300 Ocean Dr, Corpus Christi, TX 78412 USA",,,,2018-11-01,WOS:000452943300012,,

The effect of dissolved oxygen (DO) concentration on the density and distribution of fishes at this de facto artificial reef was examined. The techniques used permitted surveys of the entire water column, providing a more accurate reflection of the effect of a highly variable phenomenon (i.e., hypoxia) that may not be measured with traditional fisheries sampling equipment. Hypoxic conditions were observed during two of the five trips to the petroleum platform, South Timbalier 54. When hypoxia was present, fish density was dramatically higher in the strata immediately above the hypoxia. It was difficult to determine the exact impact of hypoxia on target strength (a measure of fish size), as the larger mean target strengths observed in the spring and summer may be due to seasonal factors and not to hypoxia alone. With the exception of the fall 1995 survey (which had significantly higher density and abundance estimates than other surveys), the estimated number of fishes did not vary among any of the sample periods. Even when 32% (15-22 m) of the water column was hypoxic (summer 1996), abundance estimates were slightly higher than in other survey periods without hypoxia (except fall 1995). While hypoxia reduced the availability of the water column to fishes, they concentrated where favorable DO levels were found.

By accounting for specific animal behaviour in the model, it is possible to identify finer-scale patterns of habitat use. Together with spatially explicit data on anthropogenic activities, models can be used to assess human impacts and inform conservation management. This study used observations of breeding behaviour to identify fine-scale breeding habitats of humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae), as well as potential overlap of these habitats with cumulative anthropogenic impacts.Location Eastern Tropical Atlantic, West Africa.Methods Maxent was used to model humpback distribution using pertinent environmental predictors and an integrated dataset of humpback whale occurrences filtered for breeding-specific behaviours. In conjunction with multiple anthropogenic activities, a subsequent cumulative utilization and impact analysis assessed the degree of overlap between predicted breeding habitat and potential anthropogenic impacts.Results Greatest habitat suitability occurred in warm coastal waters of Gabon, and other highly suitable areas occurred off Equatorial Guinea (Bioko Island), Cameroon and Angola. Sea surface temperature and height contributed most to the model. Highest overlap between humpback whales and potential impacts from anthropogenic activities occurred off Gabon, Equatorial Guinea (Bioko Island), Cameroon and Angola. Impacts associated with oil and gas development (where oil and gas platforms serve as an indicator for industry activity) appeared to contribute most to potential cumulative impact.Main Conclusions Depth and sea surface temperature of predicted breeding habitats were consistent with previous studies. However, lesser known characteristics such as sea surface height and wind speed, resulting in potentially more sheltered areas for breeding whales, may also be important in delineating finer-scale habitat suitability. Identified areas of high potential cumulative impact occurred within exclusive economic zones of multiple countries and likely represent the minimum level of impact to humpback whales in the region, highlighting the need for additional research and effective management throughout the area.",,,,,,,,,9,1,0,0,9,0,9,,,1366-9516,1472-4642,,,,,,,,,,"Wildlife Conservat Soc, Ocean Giants Program, Bronx, NY 10460 USAColumbia Univ, Ecol Evolut & Environm Biol Dept, New York, NY USANat Resources Def Council, New York, NY USAUniv Washington, Sch Interdisciplinary Arts & Sci, Bothell, WA USAWildlife Conservat Soc, Global Conservat Program, Bronx, NY USA",Nat Resources Def Council,,,2020-03-10,WOS:000515427700001,,

This results in a key role of offshore wind farms regarding the turnaround in energy policy. In most cases, offshore wind turbines are erected by pile driving leading to a significant noise impact. In consequence, limiting values for emitted underwater noise have been prescribed to avoid a negative influence on marine mammals. To fulfill these requirements, different sound damping systems are currently developed or under investigation. Thereby, the numerical prediction of the resulting sound pressure level is an important tool to prevent cost-intensive offshore tests.As a general approach different numerical modeling techniques are used to study the generated pressure wave, taking into account the near and far field propagation separately. To model the area near the pile of the wind turbine, a detailed finite element approach is used. For the far field propagation, numerically highly effective methods are needed to predict the sound pressure level at large distances of several kilometers from the pile. In a combined model, results of the area close to the pile are transferred to a separate model using wavenumber integration to compute the sound pressure in the far field of the pile.

These focus on sea mammals, seabirds, benthos or demersal fish, but generally ignore any potential effects OWFs may have on the pelagic ecosystem. The only work on the latter has been through modelling analyses, which predict localised impacts like enhanced vertical mixing leading to a decrease in seasonal stratification, as well as shelf-wide changes of tidal amplitudes. Here we provide for the first-time empirical bio-physical data from an OWF. The data were obtained by towing a remotely operated vehicle (TRIAXUS ROW) through two non-operating OWFs in the summer stratified North Sea. The undulating TRIAXUS transects provided high-resolution CTD data accompanied by oxygen and chlorophyll-a measurements. We provide empirical indication that vertical mixing is increased within the OWFs, leading to a doming of the thermocline and a subsequent transport of nutrients into the surface mixed layer (SML). Nutrients were taken up rapidly because underwater photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) enabled net primary production in the entire water column, especially within submesoscale chlorophyll-a pillars that were observed at regular intervals within the OWF regions. Video Plankton Recorder (VPR) images revealed distinct meroplankton distribution patterns in a copepod-dominated plankton community. Hydroacoustic records did not show any OWF effects on the distribution of pelagic fish. The results of a pre-OWF survey show however, that it is difficult to fully separate the anthropogenic impacts from the natural variability. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Coincident with the initiation of the decommissioning of six platforms in the SCB, the goal of this study was to examine how a platform's geographical location plays a role in its potential contribution of larval recruits to natural areas. Using a three-dimensional biophysical model, we quantified the potential connectivity of larvae, particularly relevant to reef fishes, from three offshore platforms to four coastal shelf regions where the majority of rocky settlement habitat occurs in the SCB. The regions cover the shelves of the mainland coast and islands and offshore banks in the southern SCB. The main findings indicate that (1) the potential for larval subsidies from platforms in the southern SCB to populations in the northern SCB are greater than the potential for larval subsidies from platforms in the northern SCB to the southern SCB; (2) there is greater seasonal variability of potential connectivity from platforms to the mainland shelf region of the northern SCB than to the mainland shelf region of the southern SCB or shelves around islands and banks; and (3) there is consistency across years in the relative magnitude of potential connectivity from the platforms to the four shelf regions.

Only C, antennarius individuals recruited onto the platform, primarily into the attached community of Mytilus galloprovincialis and M. californianus at depths of <12 to 15 m. The higher CPUE (catch per unit effort) of C. antennarius beneath the platform, compared with nearby soft bottom stations, suggested that this species remained primarily in the vicinity of the platform. Although C. anthonyi did not recruit at the platform, adult female C. anthonyi were attracted to the platform from surrounding habitat. The higher CPUE of female C. anthonyi beneath the platform, compared with soft bottom stations, suggested that habitat selection is related to reproduction in this species. C. productus and Loxorhynchus grandis were present in low numbers at all benthic stations. The distribution and abundance of these crab species fit into 3 of 4 hypothesized scenarios that described different combinations of recruitment, distribution and abundance of mobile species around oil platforms: (1) 'recruitment/emigration', a platform provides recruitment habitat and individuals that recruit to the platform emigrate at some point to the surrounding environment, (2) 'recruitment/resident', a platform provides recruitment habitat, but individuals remain in the vicinity of the structure (C. antennarius), (3) 'attraction', individuals that recruited elsewhere are attracted to and aggregate at a platform (C. anthonyi), and (4) 'visitor', individuals that recruited elsewhere occur temporarily at the platform without aggregation (C. productus, L. grandis).

The simulation tool builds on several recent developments in computational fluid dynamics and hydrodynamics, including a high-order spectral method for waves, large-eddy simulation on a wave surface-fitted grid for wind turbulence, and a hybrid multi-fluid simulation for steep and breaking waves. Using high-performance computing on massively parallel computers, the PI plans to resolve the spatial and temporal details of the wave and wind fields and provide valuable information for wind and wave energy applications. The tasks of the project are to: (i) Develop advanced numerical capability for the wavephase-resolving simulation of ocean wave and wind motions. (ii) Use the wind?wave simulation tool to obtain a better understanding of the ocean wind and wave fields as resources for sustainable energy. (iii) Apply the simulation tool to applications in offshore wind farms, and explore the extension to wave energy harvesting. The PI will improve the simulation and prediction capabilities for offshore winds and waves that are particularly useful for the study of offshore renewable energy. The proposed simulation approach, which considers the full coupling between wind turbulence and nonlinear ocean waves and resolves the details of wave phases, is the first of its kind and possesses an advantage over traditional wave-phase-averaging simulation methods. The application to the simulation of marine atmospheric boundary layer with wind turbine arrays will help answer many scientific and engineering questions related to the development of offshore wind farms. The simulations, with the wave phases resolved, will also be valuable for the understanding of nonlinear wave dynamics and will be helpful for the design of wave energy converters. Broader impacts: The topic of this study, sustainable energy from offshore winds and waves, is of great interest to the scientific community as well as the general public. The simulation tool developed in this project will have direct applications in offshore wind and wave energy harvesting. It can be used for the mapping of renewable energy resources, site selection of wind farms, optimization of wind turbine array arrangements, and operation of wind turbines and wave energy devices in various sea environments. Doctoral graduate education will stress multi-disciplinary training with a focus on modeling multiscale and multi-physics problems. Recruiting of domestic graduate students will leverage an existing NSF IGERT project. The IGERT project focuses on the training in scientific modeling and computation for Ph.D. students in their first two years of study. The project will lead to natural continuation for an IGERT trainee for the remaining three years of Ph.D. study. Ongoing outreach to local Baltimore high schools will be actively continued by providing research experiences for high school students, especially under-represented minorities.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,1133700,,,,,,,,Johns Hopkins University,,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:13518730,,

In order to do so we consulted previous reports in the literature and also compiled new unpublished information on the distribution of the three species of Tubastraea which have been reported as non indigenous species, both within their native and non-native ranges and also on vectors, and where cryptogenic. We combine these data with historical aspects of marine vectors in order to get insights into how Tubastraea species have successfully spread around the world, established and invaded and where future studies would be best focused. T. coccinea and T. tagusensis are recognized as being highly invasive and are causing significant environmental, economic, and social impacts requiring management actions. The third species, T. micranthus so far only reported outside its native range on oil platforms, may have similar potential for negative impact. The vectors of introduction of Tubastraea may have changed throughout history and the biological invasion of these invasive corals may reflect changing practices, demands and legislation in shipping activities over the years. Today it is clear that these corals are fouling organisms strongly associated with oil and gas platforms worldwide which are thus primary vectors for new introductions.",,,,,,,,,112,1,0,0,101,3,116,,,1387-3547,1573-1464,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Estado Rio de Janeiro, Inst Biol Roberto Alcantara Gomes, Dept Ecol, Lab Ecol Marinha Bent, Rua Sao Francisco Xavier 524,PHLC Sala 220, BR-20550900 Rio De Janeiro, RJ, BrazilOcean Associates, POB 7390, Pago Pago, AS 96799 USALouisiana Univ Marine Consortium LUMCON, 8124 Hwy 56, Chauvin, LA 70344 USASmithsonian Inst, Dept Invertebrate Zool, Natl Museum Nat Hist, Washington, DC 20560 USAUniv Fed Rio de Janeiro, Programa Posgrad Biodiversidade & Biol Evolut, Rio De Janeiro, BrazilUniv Fed Rio de Janeiro, Inst Biol Ilha Fundao, BR-21941913 Rio De Janeiro, RJ, BrazilUniv Sao Paulo, Inst Oceanog, Praca Oceanog,191 Sala 112 Cidade Univ, BR-05508120 Sao Paulo, SP, BrazilUniv Fed Bahia, Lab Ecol Benton, Programa Posgrad Ecol & Biomonitoramento, BR-40170290 Salvador, BA, BrazilUniv Estado Rio de Janeiro, Inst Biol Roberto Alcantara Gomes, Programa Posgrad Ecol & Evolucao, 524 PHLC,Sala 220, BR-20559900 Rio De Janeiro, RJ, BrazilInst Brasileiro Biodiversidade BrBio, Rua Senador Dantas,20-1509 Ctr, BR-20 03120 Rio De Janeiro, RJ, Brazil",Ocean AssociatesLouisiana Univ Marine Consortium LUMCONInst Brasileiro Biodiversidade BrBio,,,2017-01-01,WOS:000392187700020,,

The objectives of the studies were to separate the effects of construction and operation on hard bottom habitats, demersal fish, lobster and crabs, and recreational boating from regional changes in conditions. Study elements included: early engagement with stakeholders (fishermen and boaters), adaptive monitoring based on data and stakeholder feedback, cooperative research with commercial fishermen, use of methods consistent with regional surveys, stratified random sampling within a before-after-control-impact (BACI) design, power analysis (when possible) to determine sample size, and multiple metrics to evaluate fish and fisheries resources. This combination of studies and analytical approaches evaluated multiple mechanisms by which potential effects could be detected. Lessons learned included practical guidance, for example, for collaborating with stakeholders and regional scientists to address concerns through adaptive monitoring, quantifying uncertainty associated with BACI contrasts, and evaluating the duration of a seasonal lobster survey.

The collision risk is often assessed by measuring avian flight heights. Therefore, we measured flight height distributions of 15 seabird taxa, abundant in German offshore waters, with an optical laser rangefinder (n = 2508 measurements). For lesser black-backed gulls, we compared these rangefinder measurements to flight heights recorded by GPS data loggers which were attached to 17 birds during incubation. Both methods have specific advantages and disadvantages. Rangefinder measurements are only possible during the day, and rain or fog prevents successful measurements. Data were negatively biased against low and very high flight heights. Since measuring low-flying birds proved more difficult during application of the method in the field, observers should be instructed to dedicate extra effort to measure low-flying birds. Visual observations of low-flying birds can also help to reduce uncertainty and overcome bias problems. Flight heights ranged from - 3 to 431 m above sea level. Most seabirds (70%) flew below rotor level (30 m), but about 30% (mainly large gulls and cormorants) flew in the rotor-swept area. GPS height measurements show a similar general pattern of flight height distribution as rangefinder measurements. However, this method is restricted to few individuals.

As tidal currents move past the OWF foundation structures they generate a turbulent wake that will contribute to a mixing of the stratified water column. In this study we show that the mixing generated in this way may have a significant impact on the large-scale stratification of the German Bight region of the North Sea. This region is chosen as the focus of this study since the planning of OWFs is particularly widespread. Using a combination of idealised modelling and in situ measurements, we provide order-of-magnitude estimates of two important time scales that are key to understanding the impacts of OWFs: (i) a mixing time scale, describing how long a complete mixing of the stratification takes, and (ii) an advective time scale, quantifying for how long a water parcel is expected to undergo enhanced wind farm mixing. The results are especially sensitive to both the drag coefficient and type of foundation structure, as well as the evolution of the pycnocline under enhanced mixing conditions-both of which are not well known. With these limitations in mind, the results show that OWFs could impact the large-scale stratification, but only when they occupy extensive shelf regions. They are expected to have very little impact on large-scale stratification at the current capacity in the North Sea, but the impact could be significant in future large-scale development scenarios.",,,,,,,,,53,0,0,0,23,0,54,,,1932-6203,,,,,,,,,,,"Helmholtz Zentrum Geesthacht, Inst Coastal Res, Geesthacht, GermanyMIT, Joint Program Oceanog Appl Ocean Sci & Engn, Woods Hole Oceanog Inst, Woods Hole, MA USA",,,,2016-08-11,WOS:000381381100076,27513754,

Our examination of marine communities associated with oil platforms in Gabon is the first scientific investigation of these structures and highlights the unique ecosystems associated with them. A number of species previously unknown to Gabonese waters were recorded during our surveys on these platforms. Clear distinctions in benthic communities were observed between older, larger platforms in the north and newer platforms to the south or closer to shore. The former were dominated by a solitary cup coral, Tubastraea sp., whereas the latter were dominated by the barnacle Megabalanus tintinnabulum, but with more diverse benthic assemblages compared to the northerly platforms. Previous work documented the presence of limited zooxanthellated scleractinian corals on natural rocky substrate in Gabon but none were recorded on platforms. Total estimated fish biomass on these platforms exceeded one ton at some locations and was dominated by barracuda (Sphyraena spp.), jacks (Carangids), and rainbow runner (Elagatis bipinnulata). Thirty-four percent of fish species observed on these platforms are new records for Gabon and 6% are new to tropical West Africa. Fish assemblages closely associated with platforms had distinct amphi-Atlantic affinities and platforms likely extend the distribution of these species into coastal West Africa. At least one potential invasive species, the snowflake coral (Carijoa riisei), was observed on the platforms. Oil platforms may act as stepping stones, increasing regional biodiversity and production but they may also be vectors for invasive species. Gabon is a world leader in terrestrial conservation with a network of protected areas covering >10% of the country. Oil exploration and biodiversity conservation currently co-exist in terrestrial and freshwater ecosystems in Gabon. Efforts to increase marine protection in Gabon may benefit by including oil platforms in the marine protected area design process.

To validate these lab results, an in situ field experiment was carried out on board of a pile driving vessel. Juvenile European sea bass (Dicentrarchus labrax) of 68 and 115 days post hatching were exposed to pile-driving sounds as close as 45 m from the actual pile driving activity.

The removal sites had higher concentrations of many contaminants than reef or control sites, but lower concentrations than platform sites. Reduced meiobenthic abundances and altered Harpacticoida community structure were primarily a function of reef effects, not contaminant effects. The habitat influence is likely a result of complex ecological interactions near platforms.

The steady-state power-wind speed characteristics for the system are derived from a numerical thermofluid model. The latter integrates the hydraulic characteristics of the wind turbine-pump combination and a numerical code to simulate the heat gained/ lost by deep sea water as it flows through a pipeline to shore. The model was applied to a hypothetical megawatt-scale wind turbine installed at a deep offshore low wind site in the vicinity of the Central Mediterranean island of Malta. One year of wind speed and ambient measurements were used in conjunction with marine thermocline data to estimate the time series electricity and thermal energy yields. The total energy yield from the system was found to be significantly higher than that from a conventional offshore wind turbine generator (OWTG) that only produces electricity.

The artificial reef effect is important when constructing, for example, scour protections since it can generate an enhanced habitat. Specifically, artificial structures can create increased heterogeneity in the area important for species diversity and density. Offshore energy installations also have the positive side effect as they are a sanctuary area for trawled organisms. Higher survival of fish and bigger fish is an expected outcome that can contribute to a spillover to outer areas. One negative side effect is that invasive species can find new habitats in artificial reefs and thus influence the native habitats and their associated environment negatively. Different scour protections in offshore wind farms can create new habitats compensating for habitat loss by offshore energy installations. These created habitats differ from the lost habitat in species composition substantially. A positive reef effect is dependent on the nature and the location of the reef and the characteristics of the native populations.

We evaluated the habitat value of petroleum platforms by monitoring the fidelity of red snapper to these structures with acoustic telemetry. In May 2003, 125 red snapper were captured with hook and line at several platforms in a 35-km(2) portion of the South Timbalier oil and gas lease blocks, 50 km south of Port Fourchon, Louisiana. Following anaesthetization with MS-222, an individually coded acoustic pinger was surgically implanted into the peritoneal cavity of each specimen. After a short recovery period fish were released at five platforms in the study area. Presence of individual snapper was recorded with omnidirectional acoustic receivers attached to eight platforms. Red snapper exhibited little movement among platforms in the study area; however, logistic regression showed a high initial fidelity to release location which subsequently decreased over time. Therefore, site fidelity was estimated to be high in the short-term, but much lower in the long-term. However, study results were confounded by tag detection issues that may have resulted in long-term site fidelity being underestimated.

Monopiles are often used as a foundation concept for offshore windmill turbines. In this study, coupled dynamic equations with the u - P formulation for low-frequency load are considered for an offshore wind turbine monopile foundation, to present the response in terms of pore water pressure (PWP), stress and strain distribution in an elastic porous medium at regions around the monopile foundation. Different stress recovery techniques based on the Zienkeiwicz-Zhu (ZZ) error estimator namely, super-convergent patch recovery (SPR), weighted super-convergent patch recovery (WSPR), and L-2-projection techniques are also investigated to recover the stresses at nodal points in the finite element method. To estimate errors in the time domain when performing transient simulations, three recovery processes are used with different meshes. The convergence of the dynamic problem is also studied. The results are verified with findings in the literature, revealing that the time period of effective stresses follows the applied load frequency. In conclusion, the history of the shear stress can have an important effect on the shear stress distribution, making it asymmetric in the time domain. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

It has been argued that this effect should be considered during decisions over their removal during decommissioning. In the North Sea, leaving such structures in place is prohibited but derogations are allowed for large concrete installations. To assess removal options for one such installation, the Halfweg GBS (gravity-based structure) a concrete platform foundation off the Dutch coast, we studied the resident fouling macrofauna community. The faunal structure, biomass and trophic composition of the Halfweg was then compared with those from the surrounding seabed sediments, other local artificial structures and a natural rocky reef. In total, 65 macrofaunal species were observed on the concrete (52 species), steel legs (32) and surrounding rock dump (44) of Halfweg. Mean Simpson diversity per sample was highest on the rock dump (0.71) but concrete (0.54) and steel (0.60) of the GBS were lower than seabed (0.69). Ten of the species observed on the concrete were not reported on other substrates while 10 of the species were also observed in the surrounding seabed. The GBS structure was numerically dominated by Arthropoda which comprised 98% of the total abundance. Mean ash free dry weight (AFDW) was significantly higher (p<0.001) on the Halfweg substrates (204 g AFDW per m2) than in the surrounding seabed (65 g AFDW per m2). Over 94% of the biomass on Halfweg consisted of the plumose anemone Metridium senile. While common on other reefs, this species was absent from the surrounding seabed. Macrofaunal feeding mechanisms of the concrete and rock dump communities on the GBS were similar to those of nearby sediments, although these differed from those on the Halfweg steel legs. Therefore, the presence of Halfweg alters the local community feeding modes. Multivariate analysis revealed that taxonomic structure of the GBS and other artificial structures significantly differed from that of the sedimentary habitats. Low numbers of non-indigenous species on Halfweg indicated that the structure does not act as a stepping stone for species invasions. Our data show that the Halfweg structures significantly increase local biodiversity and biomass. Removal of the concrete and steel legs of the GBS (leaving the rock dump) will significantly reduce local macrofauna biodiversity. The long-term impact on macrofaunal biomass is low. Leaving the complete Halfweg structure in place will result in an enriched local macrofaunal biodiversity and feeding mode diversity.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Wageningen Marine Research,,,,2023-04-06,PPRN:10678487,,

We consider such scenarios as probabilistic processes and analyze complex vessel trajectories using machine learning to model common patterns.

These parameters are crucial to minimize the O&M costs and to extend the lifetime of offshore wind turbine structures.For monopile foundations, scouring and reduction in foundation integrity over time are especially problematic because they reduce the fundamental structural resonance of the support structure, aligning that resonance frequency more closely to the lower frequencies. Since both the broadband wave energy and the rotating frequency of the turbine are contained in this low frequency band, the lower natural frequency can create resonant behavior increasing fatigue damage. Continuous monitoring of the effect of scour on the dynamics of the wind turbine will help to optimize the maintenance activities on the scour protection system.To allow proper continuous monitoring during operation, reliable state-of-the-art operational modal analysis techniques should be used.

Linear mixed models based on damped cylindrical spreading were used to analyze the data. The model's random effects coefficients represented useful information about variability in the acoustic propagation conditions. The received sound levels were dependent on the angle between pile and seabed, strike energy, and pile penetration (PP). Deeper PPs increased sound levels in a frequency dependent manner. The estimated area around the piles where auditory injury and disturbance to marine life could occur were not circular and changed by up to an order of magnitude between the lowest and highest sound level cases.

In recent years, their natural environment is being intensively altered by the construction of offshore wind farms in many coastal areas. These constructions form artificial reefs influencing local biodiversity and ecosystem functioning. It has been demonstrated that Atlantic cod is present in the vicinity of these constructions. However, empirical data concerning the diel activity and feeding behaviour of Atlantic cod in the vicinity of these artificial reefs is lacking. Atlantic cod has a flexible diel activity cycle linked to spatio-temporal variations in food availability and predation risk. In this study we integrated acoustic telemetry with stomach content analysis to quantify diel activity and evaluate diel feeding patterns at a windmill artificial reef (WAR) in the Belgian part of the North Sea. Atlantic cod exhibited crepuscular movements related to feeding activity; a 12 h cycle was found and the highest catch rates and stomach fullness were recorded close to sunset and sunrise. It is suggested that the observed diel movement pattern is related to the prey species community and to predation pressure. Foraging at low ambient light levels (i.e. at dusk and dawn) probably causes a trade-off between foraging success and reducing predation pressure. Fish did not leave the area in-between feeding periods. Hence other benefits (i.e. shelter against currents and predators) besides food availability stimulate the aggregation behaviour at the WARS.

Risk for population impacts may exist to soaring migrants such as raptors with K-strategic life-history characteristics. Soaring migrants display strong dependence on thermals and updrafts and an affinity to land areas and islands during their migration, a behaviour that creates corridors where raptors move across narrowstraits and sounds and are attracted to islands. Several migration corridors for soaring birds overlap with the development regions for marine wind farms in NW Europe. However, no empirical data have yet been available on avoidance or attraction rates and behavioural reactions of soaring migrants to marine wind farms. Based on a post-construction monitoring study, we show that all raptor species displayed a significant attraction behaviour towards a wind farm. The modified migratory behaviour was also significantly different from the behaviour at nearby reference sites. The attraction was inversely related to distance to the wind farm and was primarily recorded during periods of adverse wind conditions.

For tackling noise, vibration, and harshness (NVH) issues and validating complex simulation models, it is of high interest to continuously track the vibration levels and the evolution of the modal parameters (resonance frequencies, damping ratios, mode shapes) of the fundamental modes of the turbine. Wind turbines are multi-physical machines with significant interaction between their subcomponents.

Rockfishes of about five species dominated the deeper parts of the platforms, reefs, and shipwrecks, while YOY blacksmith, Chromis punctipinnis (Cooper, 1863), were most characteristic of the shallow portions of platforms. Over the course of the study, we observed large fluctuations in the recruitment success of fishes; recruitment of rockfishes was particularly successful in 2010, while particularly poor for blacksmith in the same year. This interannual pattern was observed throughout our study sites.

Recent decades have seen the successful replication of this effect using artificial reef structures, particularly those created in the Gulf of Mexico using redundant oil and gas platforms. Recognising the success elsewhere has led to a consideration of the potential of this approach in North Sea waters, exemplified by a feasibility study for establishing an artificial reef in the Moray Firth (Scotland, UK). The Moray Firth is an area of outstanding biological importance which, like other Scottish estuaries, is under increasing threat from the pressure of industry, shipping and recreational activities. A necessary first step towards proper conservation and management of natural resources is the collation of detailed knowledge of the marine and coastal characteristics of the Firth. Most of the existing relevant data on the Moray Firth is in map or tabular form. As a contribution to the systematic collection of environmental data in a computer compatible form, data on prioritized themes were input to a geographical information system (GIS) as a series of computerized baseline datasets. From this GIS it is possible to practise rational planning of environmental resources, based on objective criteria. It is also possible to model and evaluate the likely impact of a proposed development. A recent example was concerned with the feasibility of constructing a steel 'artificial reef from 'materials of opportunity', using decommissioned platforms from the oil and gas industry in the North Sea. The results obtained by applying established conventional empirical procedures for site selection were compared with the results of a rigorous GIS-based approach, to identify optimal locations far the possible siting of an 'artificial reef.

To that end, it may be advisable to initially relocate the shipping lanes for the benefit of the whales prior to selecting wind energy areas.

CPUE was site (platform) specific, indicating that epifauna responded to the unique physical and chemical characteristics of each platform. The frequency of significant near-field/far-field differences declined with increasing depth as did the frequency of significant seasonal and time-of-collection differences in size and CPUE, suggesting that platforms affect adjacent community structure more strongly in shallow water and that seasonality and behavior patterns may be important promoters of this effect. Significant differences occurred no less frequently in the most mobile species (penaeid shrimp) than in the much less mobile starfish and scallops. Accordingly, discrete populations of mobile epifauna maintain their coherence for significant periods, which permits differential effects produced by nearness to platforms to be expressed in some of the most mobile invertebrates on the shelf.",,,,,,,,,13,0,0,0,11,0,17,,,0706-652X,,,,,,,,,,,"TEXAS DEPT HLTH,ENVIRONM HLTH SERV,BACLIFF,TX 77518",,,,1996-11-01,WOS:A1996WK89800018,,

Arguello, California. A pilot study was conducted to examine the distribution and abundance of rockfishes around Hidalgo (by scuba and by ROV photosurveys) and at eight adjacent natural reefs (by ROV photosurveys). To test for differences in fish assemblages among reefs using factorial ANOVA, the natural reefs were classified according to two levels each of three factors: ''low'' (0.2-0.5 m) versus ''high'' (>1 m) relief height; ''nearfield'' (<3 km from Hidalgo) versus ''farfield'' (>3 km from Hidalgo) proximity to the platform; and ''shallow'' (113-160 m) versus ''deep'' (195-213 m) reef depth. Fishes were also tagged over natural reefs with breakaway hook tags. Surveys and tagging studies were conducted from July to October 1990. During surveys in July and August, large numbers of young-of-the year (YOY) rockfishes (primarily Sebastes entomelas, S. flavidus and S. hopkinsi) were found in the surface and midwaters around Hidalgo. At the base of the platform, 1+ yr rockfishes (mainly S. entomelas and S. flavidus) were very abundant. When the platform was resurveyed in October, following the first gale of the year, nearly all the YOY rockfishes had disappeared, though the If yr fishes were still abundant at the platform's base. While the ultimate fate of the YOY rockfishes is not known, our preliminary data suggest the hypothesis that Platform Hidalgo acts as a producer of fish biomass by providing recruitment habitat for pelagic larvae to settle and grow before dispersing as small juveniles. Both multivariate cluster analysis and univariate ANOVA show that the rockfish assemblage around Hidalgo is different in species composition and abundance from those over the natural reefs, although several species co-occur at the platform and the reefs. Three-way factorial ANOVA (without replication) suggests that among the natural reefs there are no statistically significant differences (at P less than or equal to 0.05) in abundances of rockfish populations or in diversity of rockfish assemblages due to the effect of relief height, depth, or proximity to the platform. However, pattern-recognition techniques (cluster analysis) reveal distinct groupings of these fauna that are related foremost to reef depth, followed by proximity to the platform and finally relief height. Fish density differed significantly (P less than or equal to 0.05) between sampling times at selected sites. We propose that the factor relief height be dropped in subsequent definitive studies of these offshore reef assemblages. By doing so, the effects of remaining factors, including possible platform effects, on the distribution and abundances of these fishes can be tested with a more powerful replicated factorial design. Sampling also should be conducted on a number of occasions to examine patterns and sources of natural temporal variability.",,,,,,,,,25,0,0,0,12,0,26,,,0007-4977,,,,,,,,,,,"ARTHUR D LITTLE INC,EARTH & MARINE SCI,CAMBRIDGE,MA 02140MARINE RES SPECIALISTS,VENTURA,CA 93001",ARTHUR D LITTLE INCMARINE RES SPECIALISTS,,,1994-09-01,WOS:A1994QB58400065,,

Environmental assessments for oil and gas projects in the region predict insignificant adverse effects on marine birds from oil spills, incineration in platform flares and collisions. Limited baseline data on seasonal occupancies and a failure to quantify the nature and extent of marine bird attraction to platforms and related mortality undermines these assessments. We conducted 22 surveys to offshore platforms on the Grand Bank during 1999-2003 to measure avian associations with platforms and to determine the level of monitoring needed to assess the risks to marine birds. We document seasonal shifts in marine bird occurrences and higher densities of auks (fall) and shearwaters (summer) around platforms relative to surrounding areas. The limited temporal and spatial coverage of our surveys is more robust than existing industry monitoring efforts, yet it is still inadequate to quantify the scale of marine bird associations with platforms or their associated mortality risks. Systematic observations by independent biologists on vessels and platforms are needed to generate reliable assessments of risks to marine birds. Instead, the regulatory body for offshore oil and gas in eastern Canada (Canada - Newfoundland and Labrador Offshore Petroleum Board; C-NLOPB) supports industry self-reporting as the accepted form of environmental monitoring. Conflicting responsibilities of oil and gas regulatory agencies for both energy development and environmental monitoring are major barriers to transparency, unbiased scientific inquiry and adequate environmental protection. Similar conflicts with the oil and gas regulatory body in the United States, the former Minerals and Management Service (MMS) were identified by the U.S. President as a major contributor to the Deepwater Horizon disaster in the Gulf of Mexico. The MMS has since been restructured into the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, (BOEM) with separate departments responsible for drilling leases and the regulation of drilling activities. Similar restructuring of the oil and gas regulatory bodies in Canada is needed for better public information, scientific investigation and environmental protection in the offshore.

It focuses on the vibration levels and resonant frequencies of the fundamental modes of the support structure. These parameters are crucial to minimize the O&M costs and to extend the lifetime of offshore wind turbine structures.For monopile foundations, scouring and reduction in foundation integrity over time are especially problematic because they reduce the fundamental structural resonance of the support structure, aligning that resonance frequency more closely to the lower frequencies. Since both the broadband wave energy and the rotating frequency of the turbine are contained in this low frequency band, the lower natural frequency can create resonant behavior increasing fatigue damage. Continuous monitoring of the effect of scour on the dynamics of the wind turbine will help to optimize the maintenance activities on the scour protection system.To allow proper continuous monitoring during operation, reliable state-of-the-art operational modal analysis techniques should be used.

The European Union has launched an ambitious program to increase the contribution of energy production from wind turbines; the aim set for the year 2020 is that wind power should account for 31% of EU's current target regarding 20% reductions of carbon dioxide. This policy is favored by the fact that wind energy production cost is nowadays competitive in many cases to the cost of electricity produced from conventional non-renewable sources. However, there is a conflict concerning public attitudes: although the public in general is in favor of renewable energy sources including wind, there is usually very strong opposition by local people living in neighboring areas of wind farm developments that is attitudes toward wind power are to a large extent different from attitudes toward wind farms. It is also interesting that negative public opinion is rather high during the planning stage and significantly lower during the implementation stage. In addition, there are impacts on landscape aesthetic, human health as well as ecological impact on the flora and fauna, although compared to environmental impact from conventional energy sources, the environmental impact caused by wind turbines is relatively minor. Recent developments of offshore wind farms seemed to avoid people's negative attitudes and soften public resistance and hostility against wind power energy but these expectations were rather optimistic. Opposition due to seascape aesthetic spoiling is as strong even for the marine environment. The impact on marine life and particularly on sea mammals due to noise and vibrations need to be further investigated. Existing activities such as navigation, fishing and recreational activities should not be hindered during site selection and planning. In the present work public attitudes and impacts on human health as well as impacts on landscape and ecosystem level, both terrestrial and marine, are reviewed and discussed.",,,,,,,,,16,0,0,0,3,0,16,,,1790-7632,,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Aegean, Dept Marine Sci, Mitilini 81100, Greece",,,,2014-06-11,WOS:000336107200018,,

This is particularly true in the marine environment where many existing activities (e.g. fishing, aggregates, MPAs, climate change) impact the environment and newer developments (e.g. offshore wind farms) are being integrated into the overall anthropogenic footprint of effects on the environment. There is currently poor baseline information and a fragmented approach to CE assessment, which leads to highly uncertain analysis and increased environmental risk. Marine policy and legislation has clearly identified CE and potential interactions with climate change among the strategic priorities for the future. This projects aims to bring together evidence from existing and new laboratory studies of multiple stressors on benthic organisms and the communities they are part of and field based assessments of benthic communities under different environmental impact within a recently developed CE framework. To achieve the aim the project sets out a sequence of research activities for the proposed PhD student which includes joining an existing internationally experienced laboratory team studying effects on benthic communities of multiple stressors (relating to cliamte change) and adding their own elements identified through the conceptual framework. There will also be a complimentary study that will contrast benthic community data from two very different human activities: aggregate extraction and offshore wind farm developments. Cefas will train the student and provide access to aggregate data and CU and the Belgian partner (Royal Belgian Institute of Natural Sciences) will deal with offshore wind farms and the effects on the benthos. Bringing together the two different data studies will allow the student to determine the linkages between the studies in the context of the framework, thereby providing an evidence-based approach to developing a realistic CE assessment framework for application by marine environment related decision makers.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,NE/L009668/1,,,,,,,,Cranfield University,,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:15350488,,

We applied spatial eigenfunction analysis to disentangle effects of anthropogenic drivers from environmental factors on species assembly in the Faroe-Shetland Channel (FSC), in the northeast Atlantic. We found that the species assembly considered here was structured at both small and large spatial scales. Specifically, substrate types, distance to oil wells and pipelines, the presence of objects and demersal fishing (both static and mobile) appeared significant in explaining large spatial scale species assembly structures. Conversely, temperature and variance in temperature shaped the species community across smaller spatial scales. Mobile scavenger species were found in areas impacted by demersal fishing.

With the upcoming era of decommissioning of oil and gas structures, it is timely to assess the usefulness of this footage for researching these communities. We used ROV inspection footage to characterize the sessile invertebrates and fishes associated with the Goodwyn Alpha Production Platform (GWA) on the North West Shelf of Australia between depths of 10 and 125 m during 2006 and 2008. Depth was a major driver of invertebrate assemblages, most likely due to specific requirements such as light, and differences between years were most likely from the physical detachment of species by cyclones and internal waves. Phototrophic species were mostly limited to the upper 50 m of the platform, including the hard coral Pocillopora sp. and the soft corals Nephthea sp. and Scleronephthya sp. In contrast, heterotrophic species including sponges, anemones, bryozoans, hydroids, bivalves such as Lopha folium and the hard coral Tubastrea spp., were distributed across all depths. We observed 1791 fish from at least 10 families and 19 species, including commercial species such as crimson seaperch (Lutjanus erythropterus), red emperor (L. sebae), saddle-tailed seaperch (L. malabaricus), mangrove jack (L. argentimaculatus) and trevally (Caranx spp.). Fish density increased significantly with depth during 2008, from a mean of 23 fish/50 m2 between 10 and 25 m to 3373 fish/50 m2 at 125 m, where small unidentified baitfish were abundant. The highest densities of commercial species occurred between 25 and 75 m depth, suggesting that mid-depth platform sections had high habitat value, a consideration when selecting decommissioning options. The greatest difficulties using the video were the poor lighting and resolution that inhibited our ability to identify sessile species with high taxonomic precision. However, the footage was useful for evaluating high-level biodiversity of the platform, understanding how fish and invertebrate communities changed with depth and comprehending the dynamic nature of the invertebrate community over time. Understanding the habitat value of structures will be necessary for making environmentally sound decommissioning decisions in the future.

It is essential to understand the degrees to which platforms support fish over time to indicate whether biological requirements (e.g., shelter, diet, reproduction) are being met. To determine the ecological importance of platforms as fish habitat, the site fidelity and depth/habitat use of adult cabezon, Scorpaenichthys marmoratus (Ayres, 1854), grass rockfish, Sebastes rastrelliger (Jordan and Gilbert, 1880), kelp rockfish, Sebastes atrovirens (Jordan and Gilbert, 1880), and California sheephead, Semicossyphus pulcher (Ayres, 1854) were investigated at platforms Edith (50 m bottom depth) and Eureka (212 m). A total of 63 fish were acoustically tagged and monitored for up to 578 d. Sixty-three percent of individuals were still present at platforms at the end of the study (long-term site fidelity), with 55 individuals detected a mean of 66.9% (SD 36.0%) of their total days at liberty (daily site fidelity). All species displayed a shift in seasonal depth use. The shallowest horizontal level, consisting of various horizontal beams at platform Edith (15 m depth) and Eureka (17 m), was the most utilized habitat by grass rockfish, kelp rockfish, and California sheephead. Cabezon at platform Eureka utilized depths (21-31 m) unassociated with horizontal levels, while at platform Edith they primarily utilized the second horizontal level (30 m).

Multiple instances of the FAST floating wind turbine simulator are coupled modularly to the MoorDyn mooring system simulator to achieve a coupled simulation of a full shared-mooring floating wind farm. The model is demonstrated on a square shaped four-turbine shared mooring farm configuration in the presence of irregular waves and turbulent winds. Results show reasonable behaviour of the platform motions, with surge displacements under wind and wave loading that reflect the complex restoring properties of the shared mooring arrangement. Varying phase relationships in the platforms' motions arising from their spatial offsets in the sea state show that the shared mooring lines will see different excitation at either end. Fluctuations in the mooring line tensions bear out this fact, and also show the importance of line dynamics in these shared mooring arrangements.

In this paper it is shown that numerical tools used to reproduce the wave-induced loads on offshore wind turbines are often based on overly simplistic mathematical models, which lead to important inaccuracies in the assessment of the system response. The study investigates the effects of nonlinear waves on the structural response of a bottom-supported offshore wind turbine. The main concern addresses the different behavior of the system when the turbine is in parked condition or when the turbine is in power production. In the parked configuration, the nonlinear wave kinematics used in the Morison equation causes dangerous effects in terms of internal stresses and resonant vibrations of the dynamical system. They are entirely missed when a linear wave kinematics is used. When the turbine is in power production the global damping increases dramatically due to the aeroelastic interaction of the rotor. Significant growth of the system response still occurs due to the nonlinear wave forcing; however, the resonant vibrations are completely damped out. A simple quantification of the equivalent linear damping ratio, modeling the first fore-aft mode of the tower as a 1-DOF linear damped mass-spring system, permits a rough estimation of the contribution to the global damping of the aeroelastic effects. During power production the system exhibits ten-time larger damping capabilities with respect to the parked condition. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Accurate soil-structure interaction models are in essence very expensive in terms of computing time and therefore, not directly applicable to transient calculations of wind energy converters. In this work, the incorporation of dynamic soil properties is addressed. The basic model, previously developed by the authors, is based on a linearized approach using stiffness and mass matrices representing the soil-structure interaction. This approach already leads to significant reductions of the eigenfrequencies compared to clamped boundary conditions which are still commonly used. Here, the basic approach is enhanced by two aspects. Firstly, different numerical soil models, based on nonlinear springs, to calculate the matrices are compared to experimental results for embedded piles at conditions similar to the North Sea. Comparisons of numerically and experimentally determined eigenfrequencies of the piles show that nonlinear spring models are only suitable for dynamic analyses to a limited extent. Secondly, a piecewise defined response surface, which enables a linearization of the nonlinear soil behavior at different approximated operating points, is introduced. This approximation proves to be sufficiently accurate in the current setting. By analyzing two full offshore wind turbine examples in time domain, a monopile substructure and a jacket substructure anchored by piles, further shifts of the eigenfrequencies, being caused by the load dependent mechanical properties of the soil, are determined by considering the operating point.

Here we document the prevalence and performance of Kittiwakes breeding on offshore oil rigs on the Norwegian shelf and compare their reproductive output with parallel data from the nearest Kittiwake colonies monitored on the Norwegian coast. At least six (10%) of the 63 rigs addressed in the study were reported to have breeding Kittiwakes, four of which had a total of 1,164 breeding pairs in 2019. One of these offshore colonies was situated in the Barents Sea, the other five in the Norwegian Sea. Overall the Kittiwakes breeding on oil rigs had a moderate to high productivity, ranging on average between 0.61-1.07 large chicks per nest. This was higher than the productivity in most (but not all) colonies on man-made structures on the coast in the same period, and much higher than that in natural breeding habitats. The differences in Kittiwake productivity between offshore and coastal habitats are likely related to parallel differences in food availability and exposure to predators, but this warrants further study.

Therefore, the CFST columns in corrosive environment lose their excellent mechanical performances and safety as the thicknesses of steel tubes decrease due to corrosion. This has recently led to the introduction of the concrete-filled stainless steel tubular (CFSST) columns, which benefit from the stainless steel as a superior metallic corrosion resistant material. Accordingly, CFSST short columns have recently attracted the scientific community. However, circular CFSST slender columns have received very little attention. Currently, this paper provides a nonlinear finite element (FE) inelastic analysis for the axially-loaded circular CFSST slender columns to substitute the lack in their behaviour; especially when the relative cheap lean duplex stainless steel material (EN 1.4162) is utilised. The FE models are firstly validated by using the available test results in literature. This validation stage is, then, followed by a parametric analysis to explore the fundamental behaviour of such columns considering the most important factors. The paper divides the slender columns into intermediate length and long columns based on the type of the overall buckling that takes place, and then the behavioural differences between both types are clearly addressed. The obtained FE axial strengths are additionally compared with those predicted by the European (EC4) and American (AISC) specifications. Based on these comparisons, a formula, based on Eurocode 4, is suggested for the routine compressive design practice of these columns, which is found to fit well with the axial strengths of current slender columns which utilise the lean duplex stainless steel material.",,,,,,,,,15,1,0,0,0,0,16,,,0951-8339,1873-4170,,,,,,,,,,"Southwest Petr Univ, Sch Civil Engn & Architecture, Chengdu 610500, Sichuan, Peoples R ChinaTanta Univ, Fac Engn, Dept Struct Engn, Tanta, EgyptUniv Western Australia, Fac Engn Comp & Math, Sch Civil Environm & Min Engn, Nedlands, WA, Australia",,,,2020-05-11,WOS:000528602100010,,

In this research study the behavior of electrical discharges for wind turbines that might be located in the nearshore regions along the East Coast of China and Sea of Japan were characterized using a physics-based model that accounted for a total of eleven different geometrical and lightning parameters. Utilizing the electrical potential field predicted using this model it was then possible to estimate the frequency of lightning strikes and the distribution of electrical loads utilizing established semi-empirical relationships and available data. The total number of annual lightning strikes on an offshore wind turbine was found to vary with hub elevation, extent of cloud cover, season and geographical location. The annual lightning strike rate on a wind turbine along the nearshore region on the Sea of Japan during the winter season was shown to be moderately larger compared to the lightning strike frequency on a turbine structure on the East Coast of China. Short duration electrical discharges, represented using marginal probability functions, were found to vary with season and geographical location, exhibiting trends consistent with the distribution of the electrical peak current. It was demonstrated that electrical discharges of moderately long duration typically occur in the winter months on the East Coast of China and the summer season along the Sea of Japan. In contrast, severe electrical discharges are typical of summer thunderstorms on the East Coast of China and winter frontal storm systems along the West Coast of Japan. The electrical charge and specific energy dissipated during lightning discharges on an offshore wind turbine was found to vary stochastically, with severe electrical discharges corresponding to large electrical currents of long duration.

Furthermore, little information is available from fish collected on large natural reefs, such as those on the continental shelf edge, thought to be the historical center of abundance. Previous research indicates that little nutrition is derived directly from artificial reefs; rather the majority of prey comes from surrounding soft bottom habitat. The goal of this study was to determine if there are differences in the feeding ecology of red snapper between standing oil and gas platforms, toppled platforms designated as artificial reefs, and natural reefs on the continental shelf edge, using a combination of gut content and stable isotope analyses. Results indicate that fish dominated diets at all three sites, but that differences exist in the contribution of major prey items by percentage dry weight among habitats. Red snapper collected from standing platforms consumed primarily fish, squid, and shrimp, while greater amounts of crabs, shrimp, and other crustaceans were consumed at toppled platforms.

Designed artificial reef systems are similar, albeit smaller, modified habitats designed to accommodate fish assemblages. We compared fish production at a large designed reef to reported production at oil platforms. Given the focus in artificial reef research on distinguishing between new and aggregated fish production, we used a different approach to that of Claisse et al. (Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 111: 15462-15467, 2014) to calculate production, based on a steady-state assumption. This assumption simplifies the analysis and distinguishes 'local production', 'new production', and 'biomass flux'. Comparing biomass flux with standing stock biomass enables a new approach to address the production versus attraction debate, by revealing how much biomass is exposed to fishing compared to how much has local production. The local fish production at this artificial reef was 384 g m(-2) year(-1), which is within the 105887 g m(-2) year(-1) range reported by Claisse et al., although our study included visitor species not included by Claisse et al. We estimate that the fish production new to the ecosystem may only be 4-5 % of the local production, due to the large abundance of visitor species on this reef. The annual flux of biomass across this reef was very large, similar to 380 times greater than the standing stock biomass, meaning that this reef is vulnerable to overexploitation from fishing. Our results show that like oil platforms, designed artificial reefs can be very productive marine habitats, but may not greatly increase the net fish production in a system. The method detailed here will allow similar studies to be done relatively simply at other marine habitats, including fish aggregation devices.",,,,,,,,,57,1,0,0,52,0,62,,,0025-3162,1432-1793,,,,,,,,,,"Univ New South Wales, Evolut & Ecol Res Ctr, Sydney, NSW 2052, AustraliaUniv New South Wales, Sch Biol Earth & Environm Sci, Sydney, NSW 2052, AustraliaSydney Inst Marine Sci, Chowder Bay Rd, Mosman, NSW 2088, AustraliaNSW Dept Primary Ind, Port Stephens Fisheries Inst, Taylors Beach Rd, Taylors Beach, NSW 2316, Australia",,,,2016-09-01,WOS:000382753200008,,

However, most studies of migration in this region involve sampling onshore locations during the day, potentially underrepresenting the diversity and abundance of migrants passing the region. We evaluated a potential solution to this problem by recording the flight calls of passing migrants from an oil platform located southeast of the Alabama coast in the Gulf of Mexico. We detected 2762 calls during 30 nights from 9 September to 2 November 1999, and were able to identify 2329 calls to species. Flight calls by nine species of birds represented 23% of all identified calls. The greatest number of calls during one night (1017 calls) and during a 1-h period (257 calls) were recorded on 10 September. The greatest number of calls was recorded 8 h after sunset, with a secondary peak 2 h after sunset. The peak prior to sunrise may indicate the formation of flocks at dawn, and the peak after sunset may have been caused by the first wave of migrants reaching the platform. However, call counts varied extensively, with 98% of all calls recorded during 13 nights and 40% on a single night, possibly resulting from hourly and nightly differences in bird numbers aloft, atmospheric conditions, and artificial lighting conditions. Although recording on oil platforms can be difficult because of mechanical, wind, and wave noise, our results suggest great potential for describing the species composition of passing vocal migrants and the temporal patterns of flight-calling behavior if quiet recording locations can be found. Moreover, flight call monitoring could be a critically important tool for bird conservation in this region, given recent proposals to develop wind power and the potential bird mortality associated with such developments.",,,,,,,,,34,0,2,0,34,1,43,,,0273-8570,1557-9263,,,,,,,,,,"Clemson Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Clemson, SC 29631 USALouisiana State Univ, Sch Coast & Environm, Baton Rouge, LA 70803 USA",,,,2007-09-01,WOS:000249179900006,,

Offshore wind energy developments have the potential to impact on birds by displacing individuals from feeding areas etc., and also through collision of birds in flight with the rotating turbine blades and through barrier effects increasing the energetic costs associated with transit between locations. These interactions are most often discussed in the context of seabird populations at breeding colony Special Protection Areas (SPAs). However, there is also potential to interact with a wide range of species that migrate to and from the UK. These include seabirds, wildfowl, waders, passerines and raptors. The primary concern in relation to these species is of collision with turbine blades. The established modelling approach to estimating collision risk employed in environmental assessment of wind farms (the Band model) was developed by Band in 2000, updated in 2007 and has since been updated for use in the marine environment (Band 2012). For seabirds this now includes flight height distributions to further refine collision estimates. For this study, UK seabird and non-seabird species populations potentially at risk from collision with turbines at Scottish offshore wind farm sites were shortlisted, proportions of the populations likely to pass the wind farm sites estimated and collision risk modelling performed. Wind farms out-with Scottish waters are not considered, neither are the impacts of displacement and barrier effects, nor are in-combination effects with 'wet' renewables and other activities, nor impacts on populations outside of migration periods. In total modelling was carried out for 27 species of seabirds and 38 non-seabird species. For seabirds, modelling sensitivity analysis was performed by assuming different migratory corridors and distributions within those corridors and species specific flying height distributions. It was not possible to apply a similar approach for non-seabird species, as their migration routes are typically less well known. A number of assumptions were made in the analyses, including on migratory routes and bird distributions within those routes, flight heights and turbine avoidance rates (98% was used for all species). In addition, where contemporary population estimates were not available the analyses made use of historic population counts. The resulting outputs are sensitive to those assumptions and for most species improvements in the reliability of the estimates presented will require efforts to improve understanding of migration routes and avoidance rates. Seabird collision mortality estimates were dependent on the proximity of passage routes to shore and the distribution (even or asymmetrical) of birds across the migration corridors. Collision mortality estimates were assessed in relation to an indicative threshold value of 1% of the passage population.Modelling estimates for two seabird species - great black-backed gull and herring gull, had collision mortalities of over 1% of the migrant populations (the latter were derived using the flight height collision model 'Option 3'). When the Option 1 collision model was applied six species had maximum total collision estimates which exceeded 1% of the passage populations: cormorant; common gull; lesser black backed gull; herring gull; great black-backed gull and common tern (derived using the far offshore coastal strip and uniform flight distribution). It should be noted that the 1% value has been used as an indicative threshold to guide interpretation and does not have a specific biological basis. Notwithstanding the assumptions, risks and caveats outlined above, this report's primary value will be informing large-scale indicative strategic assessments. Overall, birds on migration through Scottish waters are not considered to be at risk of significant levels of additional mortality, due to collisions with Scottish offshore wind farms. Possible exceptions are large gulls, cormorant and common tern.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,2043-7722,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2015-10-29,ZOOREC:ZOOR15111071475,,

Eggs, larvae, and post-settlement juveniles typically show high rates of natural mortality. For example, of the 60 million eggs produced annually by a 10-year-old female, only about 450 would survive to 5 cm, the size at which they enter the shrimp fishery. Changes in abundance by size and age appear to be consistent with density dependence in survival rate from ages 0 to 1 and likely ages 0 to 2. Red snapper are attracted to structure or reef habitat at all ages, but larger, older fish also occur over open habitat once they have reached a size that renders them largely invulnerable to predation. Artificial reefs comprise a small fraction of the overall high-relief reef habitat, but harbor a large fraction of the present-day age 2 red snapper populations. Prior to the proliferation of artificial reefs in the northern Gulf, age 2 red snapper may have historically occurred mainly over open-bottom, sand-mud benthic habitat where natural and shrimp trawl bycatch mortality was high. Age 2 fish dominate red snapper populations at artificial reefs, whereas the age composition of red snapper at natural reefs usually show older ages are dominant. The present day red snapper fishery is heavily dependent on catches at artificial reefs. Evidence is presented that suggests red snapper production in the northern Gulf likely has been increased by the establishment of significant numbers of artificial reefs.",,,,,,,,,140,3,0,0,120,0,204,,,1064-1262,1547-6553,,,,,,,,,,"LGL Ecological Res Associates Inc, Bryan, TX 77801 USAAuburn Univ, Dept Fisheries & Allied Aquacultures, Auburn, AL 36849 USAGazey Res, Victoria, BC, Canada",LGL Ecological Res Associates IncGazey Res,,,2009-01-01,WOS:000263995500002,,

The Finnish power industry has made plans for building around 6,000 MW of offshore wind power in coastal areas, mainly targeting areas with a water depth of less than 20 metres. The reali- sation of these plans will mean that at least 1,500 units will be established along the coast in several wind parks. Information on the effects of wind power on fauna in the Baltic Sea is sparse. Wind power is relatively new in other sea areas, too, and experience of its effect on fish, birds and mam- mals limited to a short period. The effect of a single tower may prove easier to predict, but assessment of one or more large wind parks along a length of coast presents greater difficulty. Building wind power in a sea area causes several changes in the environment, some of which carry long-term effects. Dredging during building causes deterioration of water qual- ity and increasing sedimentation in the surroundings. Construction noise may reach levels that can harm living creatures in the immediate vicinity. Noise may also travel far in the water column, during the operational as well as the construction phase. Electromagnetic radiation may affect fish behaviour, e.g. the orientation of migration. As the bulk of offshore wind power is currently planned for areas with a water depth of less than 10 metres [long dash] i.e. often productive habitats important for several fish, bird and mammal species as spawning, nursery or feeding areas [long dash] the effects should be known before initiat- ing the building of large wind parks. Inventories of the nature values of these areas are still far from complete. Preference should be given to areas of deeper water or dry land for the location of wind power units, at least until the harmful effects on fish, sea birds and sea mammals have been properly evaluated.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,1796-8887,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2011-05-25,ZOOREC:ZOOR14706042766,,

Although existing leases require complete removal of all platforms and associated infrastructure, the underlying laws and regulations have changed in recent years to allow a number of alternative uses after decommissioning. In particular, AB 2503, signed into law in September 2010, provides for a rigs-to-reefs program that allows the state to accept ownership of decommissioned platforms in federal waters. Decisions about whether to remove platforms completely or leave them in place as artificial reefs will depend in part on the relative cost of the 2 options. In this study, we describe the design and use of a mathematical decision model that provides detailed cost estimates of complete and partial removal (to 85 feet below the water line) for California's offshore platforms. The model, PLATFORM, is loaded with Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement (BSEE) and Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) costs for complete removal, along with costs for partial removal calculated for this study and estimates of the uncertainty associated with decommissioning cost estimates. PLATFORM allows users to define a wide range of decommissioning and costing scenarios (e.g., number of platforms, choice of heavy lift vessel, shell mound removal, reef enhancement). As a benchmark cost, complete removal of all 27 offshore platforms, grouped into the 7 decommissioning projects defined by the most recent federal cost estimates produced in 2010, would cost an estimated $1.09 billion, whereas partial removal of these platforms, grouped into the same set of projects, would cost $478 million, with avoided costs of $616 million (with minor rounding).

An oil and gas platform typically operates on an island (stand-alone system) and the power demand is covered by two or more gas turbines. In order to improve the plant performance, a bottoming cycle unit can be added to the gas turbine topping module, thus constituting a combined cycle plant. This paper aims at developing and testing the numerical model simulating the part-load and dynamic behavior of a novel power system, composed of two gas turbines and a combined gas turbine coupled with an air bottoming cycle plant. The case study is the Draugen offshore oil and gas platform, located in the North Sea, Norway. The normal electricity demand is 19 MW, currently covered by two gas turbines generating each 50% of the power demand, while the third turbine is on stand-by. During oil export operations the power demand increases up to 25 MW. The model of the new power plant proposed in this work is developed in the Modelica language using basic components acquired from ThermoPower, a library for power plant modelling. The dynamic model of the gas turbine and the air bottoming cycle turbogenerator includes dynamic equations for the combustion chamber, the shell-and-tube recuperator and the turbine shafts. Turbines are modelled by the Stodola equation and by a correlation between the isentropic efficiency and the non-dimensional flow coefficient. Compressors are modelled using quasi steady-state conditions by scaling the maps of axial compressors employing a similar design point. The recuperator, which recovers the exhaust heat from the gas turbine, is modelled using correlations relating the heat transfer coefficient and the pressure drop at part-load with the mass flow rate. Thermodynamic variables and dynamic metrics, such as the rise time and the frequency undershooting/ overshooting, are predicted. Considering a load ramp of 0.5 MW/s, an undershooting of 4.9% and an overshooting of 3.0% are estimated. The rise time is approximately 30 s. Moreover, findings suggest that decreasing the core weight of the recuperator leads to limiting the frequency fluctuations, thus minimizing the risk of failure of the power system.",,,,,12th ASME Biennial Conference on Engineering Systems Design and Analysis (ESDA2014)12th ASME Biennial Conference on Engineering Systems Design and Analysis (ESDA2014),"JUN 25-27, 2014JUN 25-27, 2014",ASMEASME,"Copenhagen, DENMARKCopenhagen, DENMARK",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,978-0-7918-4584-4,,,,,,,,,"Univ Padua, Dept Ind Engn, Padua, ItalyTech Univ Denmark, Dept Mech Engn, DK-2800 Lyngby, Denmark",,,,2015-10-07,WOS:000361405700036,,

A total of 89 % of recorded fixes were below 20 m above sea level, indicating an overlap between foraging flights and the rotor area of most operating wind turbines. The gulls flew lower over the sea than over land, and lower at night than during the day. Straight commuting flights were higher than tortuous flights, when the gulls were supposed to be foraging. Outbound and inbound flights occurred at similar heights, and flight height was unaffected by wind.

For most of these chemicals, environmental toxicity and safety thresholds in marine ecosystems have not been fully investigated as yet. In this work, a numerical-ecotoxicological approach is proposed to assess the potential environmental risk associated with the discharge of five oilfield production chemicals (deoiler, scale inhibitor, corrosion inhibitor, catalyst, dehydrating agent) from a platform in the southern Adriatic Sea (Mediterranean Sea). Their concentrations in the seawater are numerically predicted, under different seasonal conditions, starting from the real concentrations used during the production process.

The purpose of our study was to measure the avoidance rates of Tasmanian wedge-tailed eagles (Aquila audax fleayi) and white-bellied sea-eagles (Haliaeetus leucogaster) using a new method, and to examine factors affecting these rates. We conducted eagle surveys at the Musselroe Wind Farm (undeveloped and used as a control); Studland Bay Wind Farm during commissioning and operational stages; and Bluff Point Wind Farm during the operational stage, all in northern Tasmania, Australia. Observers documented flight tracks and behavior of eagles over 875 days during the period 2006-2008. Both species demonstrated a distinct avoidance of the turbines, preferring to fly midway between them. Avoidance rates were 81%-97%, and differed significantly between species and sites, with white-bellied sea-eagles avoiding at a higher rate than wedge-tailed eagles. Eagles at Bluff Point had a higher avoidance rate than those at Studland Bay, even though the sites were only 3 km apart. Both species altered their avoidance rates in response to stages in the wind-farm development, but only the wedge-tailed eagle altered its rate in response to weather conditions, demonstrating a higher avoidance rate during wet and windy conditions. Our study found that the interaction of eagles and wind turbines is complex, which highlights the need for further study of avoidance rates in species at different sites.

While summer hypoxia typically affects the bottom 3.0 m of the water column, platforms span from the bottom to above the surface and provide hard substrate in oxygenated waters overlaying hypoxia. However, little is known about the effects of hypoxia on organisms living at these platforms. We compared diets of Sheepshead Archosargus probatocephalus and Gulf stone crabs Menippe adina during early and late summer at platforms with mild (shoal platforms) and intense hypoxia (seaward platforms) using a combination of stable isotopes (delta C-13 and delta N-15) and gut contents analyses. We hypothesized that diets at seaward platforms would shift from bottom to platform-dwelling prey during late summer when hypoxia had fully developed and decimated benthic communities, but no such effect was found. Barnacles (Balanidae) were the most common prey found in Sheepshead guts for all samples collected (64.1% of gut contents). Sheepshead gut contents showed high predation of mantis shrimp (Squillidae; 35.2% of gut contents) soon after the formation of hypoxia at seaward platforms, likely reflecting Sheepshead exploiting benthic prey that were vulnerable because of hypoxia. These findings indicate that hypoxia affected the behavior of mantis shrimp in a way that altered their availability for Sheepshead associated with platforms. Comparisons of Sheepshead and stone crab isotope values (delta C-13 and delta N-15) to those of their potential prey and basal sources suggested a high dependence on barnacles (proxy for water column particulate organic matter) and filamentous algae throughout the summer. However, comparisons of isotope values in early and late summer indicated no apparent effect of hypoxia. High contributions of barnacles to Sheepshead diet showed that platform-dwelling prey were an important resource for Sheepshead.",,,,,,,,,10,0,0,0,7,0,10,,,0002-8487,1548-8659,,,,,,,,,,"Louisiana State Univ, Dept Oceanog & Coastal Sci, 1002-Y Energy Coast & Environm Bldg, Baton Rouge, LA 70803 USALouisiana Univ Marine Consortium, 8124 Highway 56, Chauvin, LA 70344 USAFlorida Fish & Wildlife Conservat Commiss, Fish & Wildlife Res Inst, 100 8th Ave Southeast, St Petersburg, FL 33701 USA",Louisiana Univ Marine Consortium,,,2019-04-05,WOS:000461869200005,,

Hydralab+ which is funded by the EU's Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation Programme brings together facilities and researchers in experimental hydraulic and hydrodynamics.The research project aims to improve the design of scour protection around offshore wind turbine monopiles, as well as future-proofing them against the impacts of climate change. PROTEUS, which stands for the 'PRotection of Offshore wind Turbine monopilEs against Scouring' will facilitate the conducting of a series of large scale experiments over a seven week period in the FFF flume at HR Wallingford's UK physical modelling facilities.Partners involved in PROTEUS are: Department of Civil Engineering at Ghent University, HR Wallingford (UK), the Ludwig-Franzius Institute for Hydraulic, Estuarine and Coastal Engineering at the University of Hannover, the Faculty of Engineering at the University of Porto, the Geotechnics division of the Belgian Department of Mobility and Public Works, and International Marine and Dredging Consultants (IMDC nv).",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Universiteit Gent, Belgium",Universiteit Gent,,,2020-04-08,DRCI:DATA2020035017945007,,

In view of expanding this zoning outside its limit of the test area and filling gaps in ecological zones, an effort to model those ecological zones using marine landscape or abiotic features was carried out. This study tests the accuracy of selected machine learning algorithmic models, decision tree, and random forest, for relating marine landscapes features to ecological sub-regions. Both models show to be good predictive tools with accuracy after cross validation of the order of 5-3%. Key abiotic variables to provide an accurate model were investigated. The study demonstrates the importance of the distance to coast, the sediment characteristics (fraction of clay, median size of the sediments), the hydrodynamic features, in particular not only tidal current/drag force, but also wave drag force, and finally the oceanographic characteristics such as stratification and sea surface temperature to built a good predictive model.

A total of 83 platforms, including deep-water, toppled, Rigs-to-Reefs structures, were surveyed in the northern Gulf of Mexico between 2000 and 2009, from Matagorda Island, Texas to Mobile, Alabama, USA, between the depths of 7 and 37 m, by SCUBA divers. Five platforms were surveyed by Remotely Operated Vehicle (ROV) to depths of up to 117 m. T. micranthus was found on only one platform - Grand Isle 93 (GI-93), off Port Fourchon, Louisiana, near the Mississippi River mouth, at the cross-roads of two major safety fairways/shipping lanes transited by large international commercial ships. The introduction appears to be recent, probably derived from the ballast water or hull of a vessel from the Indo-Pacific. If the growth and reproductive rates of T. micranthus, both sexual and asexual, are similar to those of T. coccinea, this species could dominate this region like its congener. It is not known whether this species is an opportunist/pioneer species, like T. coccinea, a trait protecting benthic communities from its dominance.

A 267-turbine wind farm was constructed within the core wintering area of the redhead on a private ranch along the western coast of the Laguna Madre, in 2010. Our objective was to investigate the effects of this wind farm on the habitat and potential displacement of redheads and their use of coastal ponds along the lower Texas coast. We conducted weekly aerial surveys to monitor coastal pond use by wintering redheads from mid-October through mid-March during pre-construction (2000-2003) and post-construction (2012-2014) of the wind farm. Pond availability and Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI) within the wind farm were significantly correlated during pre-construction (n=16, R-2=0.53, P=0.035) and post-construction (n=11, R-2=0.64, P=0.003). However, the number of ponds available at each PDSI level within the wind farm decreased during post-construction (paired t=3.2, n=5, P=0.033). The average number of redheads detected per survey on coastal ponds within the wind farm decreased by 77% from pre-construction to post-construction. Redhead abundance on ponds across the entire Laguna Madre increased by an average of 3.26 times between pre-construction and post-construction, partly due to increases in the continental redhead population. It appears that the wind farm has altered the use of coastal ponds by redheads during winter. Future wind farm placement along the lower Texas coast should consider coastal pond distribution and the dynamics of redhead use between coastal ponds and foraging areas in the Laguna Madre. (c) 2018 The Wildlife Society.We found that a wind farm constructed along the lower Texas coast has negatively affected redheads through reduced coastal pond availability and disturbance displacement.

The fishing sector, in the Alboran Sea, is economically and culturally one of the most important and relies on overexploited target species such as European hake (Merlucius merlucius). Here we identified and quantified the impact of human pressures on the capacity of marine habitats to support the provision of food as an important ecosystem service. We modelled the spatial distribution of nursery areas of European hake in the Alboran Sea, using General Additive Models (GAM) and overlaid those with European Nature Information System (EUNIS) habitats. A sensitivity analysis of hake nursery areas to cumulative human impacts identified the Bay of Malaga as the most sensitive area with trawling frequencies up to 60 times higher than the habitats recovery time. Further, we identified an increased conflict potential among human activities such as trawling and extraction with the presence of Marine Protected Areas (MPAs), which provide MPAs a high vulnerability similar to that found in unprotected areas. Future scenarios considering the increase of renewable energy and alternative food production show conflicts between aquaculture and MPAs as well as offshore wind farms and offshore shipping. Hence, our results show strong arguments for an integrated spatial management approach, including benthic trawling. We also suggest restricting trawling activities inside MPAs to safeguard the habitats capacity to support ecosystem services. Our spatially explicit assessment framework is transparent and transferable to other Mediterranean regions.

Within this study, different spatial co-location scenarios for the coupling of offshore aquacultures and wind farms are evaluated in order to support efficient and sustainable marine spatial management strategies. A Geographic Information System (GIS) and multi-criteria evaluation (MCE) techniques were combined to index suitable co-sites in the German exclusive economic zone of the North Sea. The MCE was based on criteria such as temperature, salinity or oxygen. In total, 13 possible aquaculture candidates (seaweed, bivalves, fish and crustaceans) were selected for the scenario configuration. The GIS modelling framework proved to be powerful in defining potential co-location sites. The aquaculture candidate oarweed (Laminaria digitata) revealed the highest suitability scores at 10-20 m depth from April to June, followed by haddock (Melanogrammus aeglefinus) at 20-30 m depth and dulse (Palmaria palmata) and Sea belt (Saccharina latissima) at 0-10 m depth between April and June. In summary, results showed several wind farms were de facto suitable sites for aquaculture since they exhibited high suitability scores for Integrated Multi-Trophic Aquaculture (IMTA) systems combining fish species, bivalves and seaweeds. The present results illustrate how synergies may be realised between competing needs of both offshore wind energy and offshore IMTA in the German EEZ of the North Sea.

Based on Fifth-Order Stokes wave theory a user-defined function is developed and used for wave numerical modeling, and a numerical wave tank with different bottom slopes is developed. The effects of different types of breaking waves, such as spilling and plunging waves, on the wave run-up, pressure distribution and horizontal wave force of a large diameter monopile are investigated. Different numerical and analytical methods for calculating the wave breaking loads are used and their results are compared with the relevant results of the developed computational fluid dynamics model and their respective scopes of application are discussed.

The intensity of interactions occurring between the breaking waves and the monopile foundation depends mainly on the form of wave breaking involved and its relationship to wave steepness is weak.

Sources include (but are not limited to) pleasure boating, fishing, the shipping of goods, offshore exploration for oil and gas, dredging, construction of bridges, harbors, oil and gas platforms, wind farms and other renewable energy devices, and the use of sonar by commercial and military vessels. There are very substantial gaps in our understanding of the effects of these sounds, especially for fishes and invertebrates. Currently, it is almost impossible to come to clear conclusions on the nature and levels of man-made sound that have potential to cause effects upon these animals. In order to develop a better understanding of effects of man-made sound, this paper identifies the most critical information needs and data gaps on the effects of various sounds on fishes, fisheries, and invertebrates resulting from the use of sound-generating devices. It highlights the major issues and discusses the information currently available on each of the information needs and data gaps. The paper then identifies the critical questions concerning the effects of man-made sounds on aquatic life for which answers are not readily available and articulates the types of information needed to fulfill each of these drivers for information-the key information gaps.

One solution is to apply factor-mediated vulnerability assessment which combines (i) information on species ecological traits and conservation status organized in a matrix of so-called vulnerability factors, (ii) a conceptual model of how these factors affect species vulnerability, and (iii) data on the spatial distribution and abundance of each species issued from at-sea surveys. Such factor-mediated vulnerability assessment was originally introduced in the seabird-wind farm context by Garthe and Huppop (2004. Scaling possible adverse effects of marine wind farms on seabirds: developing and applying a vulnerability index. Journal of Applied Ecology, 41: 724734) and has since then been expanded to many case studies. However, the mathematical formulations that were proposed at that time are overly simplistic and may overlook critical components of the impact assessment. Our study briefly reviews the original approach and highlights its hidden assumptions and associated interpretation problems, for example, the overestimation of disturbance pressure to the detriment of collision, or the very high contribution of log abundances in vulnerability maps. Then, we propose a revised framework that solves these issues and permits easy transposition to other community-pressure case studies. To illustrate the usefulness and generality of the revised framework, we apply it to two case studies, one concerning the vulnerability assessment of a seabird community to offshore wind farms in the Bay of Biscay, and another focusing on the vulnerability assessment of the benthic megafauna community to trawling pressure in the Barents Sea.",,,,,,,,,21,0,0,0,14,0,21,,,1054-3139,1095-9289,,,,,,,,,,"IMR, N-9294 Tromso, NorwayNorwegian Inst Nat Res NINA, N-7485 Trondheim, NorwaySLU, Inst Coastal Res, S-74242 Oregrund, SwedenUniv Barcelona, Inst Res Biodivers IRBio, E-08028 Barcelona, SpainUniv Barcelona, Dept Biol Anim, E-08028 Barcelona, SpainCSIC, Museo Nacl Ciencias Nat, E-28006 Madrid, SpainCNRS, F-79360 Villiers En Bois, France",,,,2015-07-08,WOS:000356233800021,,

This paper brings together the current practice in terms of engineering methods used for the determination of loads acting on the structure and the numerical methods used for the investigation of the structural behaviour of the GC. With respect to hydrodynamic loads on monopile wind turbines, the popular linear wave theory along with the Morison equation can be used to model normal sea states, whereas higher-order wave models are necessary to investigate severe events such as wave breaking. In terms of wind loads, blade element momentum proves to be advantageous with respect to computational cost and ease of implementation in simulation tools.

The effects of date, year, length, and depth of submersion were investigated by replacing sets of ceramic tiles with new tiles at frequencies of 2, 4, 6, 12, and 24 months at three depths (6, 12, and 18 in) over a period of 24 months. The effects of existing colonists and depth were explored in a second experiment by removing selected early colonists from ceramic tiles deployed at the same three depths over a period of 12 months. More than 40 invertebrate taxa from seven phyla colonized the tiles. Colonial tunicates and encrusting bryozoans appeared early in the successional sequence (similar to 2 months), in cover ranging from < 5% to 80% and from < 5% to 55%, respectively. Tubiculous amphipods, barnacles, and sponges could also appear early, but in low cover (< 20%). Composition of the assemblage changed over time with barnacles, sponges, and mussels becoming the principal space holders on tiles submerged for 24 months. When potential competitors were removed monthly, variation in the cover of dominant taxa (i.e., bryozoans, amphipods, barnacles) was maintained to 12 months, suggesting that other factors, such as larval availability or post-settlement mortality, were responsible for these patterns. Development of this assemblage appeared to fit a pattern of early succession that was largely predictable in terms of the composition and sequence of occurrence of dominant taxa, but variable in rate of development, depending on date of submersion, year, and depth.

One method for identifying the impacts of offshore wind farms (OWFs) on human welfare is through the assessment and valuation of ecosystem services. Using an ecosystem services approach, this paper reviews the impacts of OWFs on the ecosystem services delivered by marine environments. During the construction phase, supporting services such as reduced energy capture and nutrient cycling are changed due to the introduction of hard substrate and the reduction in soft sediment habitat at turbine bases. This may lead to changes in all other ecosystem services, both negative and positive. Quantifying these changes, however, is a challenge partly due to data limitations and a lack of clear understanding of the impacts of OWFs on the marine ecosystems. Scientific effort needs to quantitatively explore the impacts of OWFs on ecosystem functionality and the gathering of data that enables the assessment of changes to ecosystem services. Data needed to better quantify and value the impacts of OWFs on ecosystem services are suggested. The development of methods which integrate socioeconomic valuation of ecosystem services into the evaluation of renewable energy devices compliments efforts in assessing the environmental impacts and should enable a holistic assessment of the impact of renewable energy production and greenhouse gas mitigation technologies on the U.

Significant differences are observed in the location of the maxima. High-resolution ENVISAT ASAR measurements provide very detailed information on small-scale atmospheric features, which seem to not be captured well by the analyzed numerical models, in particular, in coastal areas.

Juvenile Atlantic cod were exposed intermittently over a period of 14 weeks to 0, 100 or 200 ppm of PW effluent from various oil and gas installations in Atlantic Canada, including the Sea Rose and Terra Nova floating production, storage and offloading vessels (FPSO), and the Venture and Thebaud gas production platforms. Three times weekly the fish were fed and then exposed to PW. PAH exposure was measured by induction of cytochrome P-450 (CYP1A) as indicated by EROD activity. Growth and food consumption were monitored. At the end of the exposure there were no significant effects of PW observed on EROD activity. Significant effects on specific growth rate (SGR) were seen in fish exposed to 200 ppm Sea Rose PW (P< 0.05) and 100 ppm Thebaud PW (P< 0.005) but there was no observed dose response. The results suggest that intermittent exposure to environmentally relevant concentrations of PW from some oil and gas platforms can affect growth.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,0706-6457,,,,,,,,,,,"Fisheries & Oceans Canada, St Andrews Biol Stn, 531 Brandy Cove Rd, St Andrews, NB, E5B 2L9, Canada",,,,2014-01-01,ZOOREC:ZOOR15312075517,,

This study uses a combination of Measure-Correlate-Predict (MCP) techniques in conjunction with commercial Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) software. MCP routines were conducted between an inland reference wind measurement station possessing a long-term wind speed and direction time series and the shorter-term 80 metre wind mast's database; with the latter assuming the role of candidate site. A procedure was followed to generate a long-term wind climatology at the candidate site. This climatology was subsequently used to calibrate CFD flow modelling software to generate a wind resources map within a coastal environment of an island archipelago in the central Mediterranean region.,,,,,,,,,5,0,0,0,0,0,5,,,0309-524X,2048-402X,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Malta, Inst Sustainable Energy, MXK-1531 Triq Il Barrakki, Marsaxlokk, MaltaUniv Malta, Dept Mech Engn, MSD-2080 Msida, Malta",,,,2013-06-01,WOS:000210798300004,,

Visual monitoring of harbour porpoises was conducted prior to as well as during construction and operation by means of 15 aerial line transect distance sampling surveys, from 2008 to 2010. Static acoustic monitoring (SAM) with echolocation click loggers at 12 positions was performed additionally from 2008 to 2011.

Lowest densities were documented during the construction period in 2009. The spatial distribution pattern recorded on two aerial surveys three weeks before and exactly during pile-driving points towards a strong avoidance response within 20 km distance of the noise source. Generalized additive modelling of SAM data showed a negative impact of pile-driving on relative porpoise detection rates at eight positions at distances less than 10.8 km. Increased detection rates were found at two positions at 25 and 50 km distance suggesting that porpoises were displaced towards these positions. A pile-driving related behavioural reaction could thus be detected using SAM at a much larger distance than a pure avoidance radius would suggest. The first waiting time (interval between porpoise detections of at least 10 min), after piling started, increased with longer piling durations. A gradient in avoidance, a gradual fading of the avoidance reaction with increasing distance from the piling site, is hence most probably a product of an incomplete displacement during shorter piling events.",,,,,,,,,139,1,0,0,114,0,145,,,1748-9326,,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Vet Med Hannover, Inst Terr & Aquat Wildlife Res, D-25761 Busum, GermanyGerman Oceanog Museum, D-18439 Stralsund, Germany",German Oceanog Museum,,,2013-08-07,WOS:000321425100049,,

Both species showed a distinct reaction to wind-turbine noise. Surfacings in harbour seals were recorded at larger distances from the sound source (median = 284 vs 239 in during controls; p = 0.008, Kolmogorov-Smirnov test) and closest approaches increased from a median of 120 to 182 m (p < 0.001) in harbour porpoises. Furthermore, the number of time intervals during which porpoise echolocation clicks were detected increased by a factor of 2 when the sound source was active (19.6% of all 1 min intervals as opposed to 8.4% of all intervals during controls; p < 0.001).

Here, we use eDNA metabarcoding to survey marine biodiversity in the vicinity of the three offshore gas platforms in North Adriatic Sea (Italy). We isolated eDNA from 576 water and sediment samples collected at 32 sampling sites situated along four axes at increasing distances from the gas platforms.

The most significant community change along the distance gradient was obtained with the 18S V1V2 marker targeting benthic eukaryotes, even though other markers showed similar trends, but to a lesser extent. These results were congruent with the AMBI index inferred from the eDNA sequences assigned to benthic macrofauna.

A comparative assessment was made of the non-financial (especially environmental) outcomes of the different scenarios, with the reference scenario being to leave all structures in situ, while other scenarios envisaged leaving them on the seabed or removing them to shore for recycling and disposal. The costs of each scenario, when compared with the reference scenario, give an implicit valuation of the non-financial outcomes (e.g. environmental improvements), should that scenario be adopted by society. The paper concludes that it is not clear that the removal of the topsides and jackets of large steel structures to shore, as currently required by regulations, is environmentally justified; that concrete structures should certainly be left in place; and that leaving footings, cuttings and pipelines in place, with subsequent monitoring, would also be justified unless very large values were placed by society on a clear seabed and trawling access.

A baseline survey from March 2002 (prior to construction) was combined with surveys conducted in March 2004 (short-term effects) and March 2010 (long-term effects) plus an additional survey in September 2009. Sandeels were collected using a modified scallop dredge and sediment samples using a van Veen grab. The results from an analysis on all species combined revealed a positive short-term effect on the densities of both juveniles and adults, which was consistent with a reduction in the fraction of silt+clay. In the long term, a negative effect on juveniles was found; however, this effect was neither consistent with the additional survey in 2009 nor the silt+clay fraction.

While underwater noise levels were shown to be harmful for the marine biology, the propagation of airborne piling noise over sea has not been studied in detail before. In this study, detailed numerical calculations have been performed with the Green's Function Parabolic Equation (GFPE) method to estimate noise levels up to a distance of 10 km. Measured noise emission levels during piling of pinpiles for a jacket-foundation wind turbine were assessed and used together with combinations of the sea surface state and idealized vertical sound speed profiles (downwind sound propagation). Effective impedances were found and used to represent non-flat sea surfaces at low-wind sea states 2, 3, and 4. Calculations show that scattering by a rough sea surface, which decreases sound pressure levels, exceeds refractive effects, which increase sound pressure levels under downwind conditions. This suggests that the presence of wind, even when blowing downwind to potential receivers, is beneficial to increase the attenuation of piling sound over the sea. A fully flat sea surface therefore represents a worst-case scenario.

To this end, a coupled two-dimensional idealized numerical model of the ocean and sediment layers, forced by an idealized offshore wind turbine wake is used. The turbine wake impacts the ocean surface and for strong wind and water layer thickness higher than 20 m, large scale eddies of the size comparable to the wake thickness are generated, leading to a turbulent dynamics in the ocean.The turbulence in the ocean is controlled by the shallow wake parameter S. The turbulent ocean dynamics is numerically integrated using time dependent simulations at fine horizontal resolution (1 m). From these simulations, eddy coefficients parametrizating the turbulent fluxes are proposed to be used in larger-scale (RANS) models. The ocean dynamics and the parameter values depend mainly on S. The ocean dynamics is laminar (S > 7.10(-2)), has a localized (7.10-2 < 7.10(-2)) or domain wide turbulent (S < 3.10(-2)) behavior. In the first two cases, changes in seabed elevation are around a few millimeters per month. For the third case, averaged over several days, changes decreases to a few tenths of millimeters per month.

Yet, only limited quantitative data on the physiological impact of impulsive sounds on (juvenile) fishes during pile driving of offshore wind farm foundations are available. Our current knowledge on fish injury and mortality due to pile driving is mainly based on laboratory experiments, in which high-intensity pile driving sounds are generated inside acoustic chambers. To validate these lab results, an in situ field experiment was carried out on board of a pile driving vessel. Juvenile European sea bass (Dicentrarchus labrax) of 68 and 115 days post hatching were exposed to pile-driving sounds as close as 45 m from the actual pile driving activity. Fish were exposed to strikes with a sound exposure level between 181 and 188 dB re 1 Pa2.s. The number of strikes ranged from 1739 to 3067, resulting in a cumulative sound exposure level between 215 and 222 dB re 1 Pa2.s. Control treatments consisted of fish not exposed to pile driving sounds. No differences in immediate mortality were found between exposed and control fish groups. Also no differences were noted in the delayed mortality up to 14 days after exposure between both groups. Our in situ experiments largely confirm the mortality results of the lab experiments found in other studies.",,,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2016-05-16,DRCI:DATA2016057008392963,,

One of the major challenges is their sensitivity to wave-induced vessel and crane tip motions, which can cause the impact of lifted components like blades and nacelle with nearby structures. The impact loads on fibre composite wind turbine blades are critical as several complex damage modes, capable of affecting the structural integrity, are developed. Planning of such installation tasks therefore requires response-based operational limits that consider impact loads on the blade along with their damage quantification. The research area considering the impact behaviour of the lifted blade is novel, and thus, the paper identifies vessel, blade and lifting parameters that determine impact/contact scenarios. Furthermore, for a case in which a lifted blade with its leading edge impacts the tower, a numerical modelling technique is presented in Abaqus/Explicit, and a comprehensive damage assessment of the blade and an investigation of the impact dynamics and energy evolution are performed. Sensitivity studies for two distinct blade designs and two different impact locations are considered. The results show that 7-20% of the impact energy is absorbed as damage in the blade, whereas the majority dissipates as rigid-body motions of the blade after the impact. The findings of the study highlight the requirement for advanced installation equipment, such as active tugger lines, to prevent successive impacts of wind turbine blades during installation.",,,,,,,,,21,1,0,0,0,0,21,,,0029-8018,,,,,,,,,,,"Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol NTNU, Dept Marine Technol, Trondheim, NorwayNTNU, Ctr Marine Operat Virtual Environm SFI MOVE, Trondheim, NorwayNTNU, Dept Mech & Ind Engn, Trondheim, NorwayNTNU, Ctr Autonomous Marine Operat & Syst SFF AMOS, Trondheim, Norway",,,,2019-02-27,WOS:000458591300011,,

Offshore areas arc being increasingly examined, as recent studies have identified possible conflicts of offshore wind farms and certain bat species.In our test, we included two automated identification programs that have not yet been tested in other studies, and a reference dataset from a different geographical region (Western-Europe) with a different species composition compared to other studies. Our data hence add to the knowledge base needed for an appropriate assessment of the reliability of analytical software.In general, Batldent (77% correct species identifications) and Kaleidoscope (71%) seem to be relatively reliable while the performance of BatExplorer (31%) is relatively poor. SonoChiro correctly identified 65% of the sequences to species level.

While the first offshore wind turbines were simply onshore turbines with wet feet, developments in turbines take account more and more of the special conditions and requirements for offshore application. This chapter addresses developments and trends in choice of concept and scale in practice and provides the theoretical background and rationale for these developments.After introducing offshore wind energy, the differences between the onshore and offshore environments are discussed. Aspects that are relevant to wind energy are surface conditions, wind climate, air conditions, the biological environment and the societal environment. To effectively deal with these differences, research has to provide new knowledge about the application of wind turbines in this new environment and designers have to adopt this knowledge in their design process. This is discussed through observations of the first steps offshore and the response of the research community.One of the most evident developments of wind turbines for offshore application is their growth in size. Although upscaling has been a long-term trend for onshore wind turbines, the desire and need for continued increase in turbine scale is now driven by their use offshore. Most multi-MW turbines are even developed specifically for this purpose. Therefore, technical issues of upscaling are discussed more in depth. These issues include changes in physical properties, such as forces and energy yield, as well as changes in components.Both upscaling of turbines and the offshore environment have resulted in conceptual changes in wind turbines. Such changes are treated for blades, bearing systems, gearboxes, generators, bedplates and control. Examples are given of multi-MW turbines that are developed for offshore application to illustrate the trends in conceptual design.Finally, ideas about future developments are reviewed.

We hypothesised that the presence of gas platforms is associated with higher organic matter (OM) contents and we tested the null hypothesis by which benthic trophic conditions do not vary significantly among gas structures with different architectural characteristics. To test these hypotheses, we investigated sedimentary OM contents and biochemical composition at increasing distance from two distinct structures: one subsea well-site and one four-leg platform (FLP). We found that sediments surrounding the structures were characterised by similar OM contents, but different biochemical compositions, and that sedimentary OM compositional change with increasing distance from the structure is confirmed only at the FLP. These results suggest that: (i) benthic eutrophication is not consistent among different structures; (ii) OM biochemical composition changes are more evident than those in OM quantity; and (iii) the effect, wherever present, disappears at a very narrow distance from the platform. As biochemical composition of OM reflects food availability for benthic organisms, our results suggest that the enrichment of macrozoobenthic communities around these structures could be the consequence of increased nutritional quality of resources.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,0275-7540,1029-0370,,,,,,,,,,"CNR, Inst Marine Sci CNR ISMAR, Ancona, ItalyUniv Politecn Marche, Dipartimento Sci Vita & Ambiente, Ancona, ItalyUniv Cagliari, Dipartimento Sci Vita & Ambiente, Cagliari, Italy",,,,2017-01-01,WOS:000392971400005,,

Since several terrestrial studies indicate that raptors are especially susceptible to wind turbine related mortality, a Spatial Planning Tool is needed so that wind farms can be sited, in an optimal way, to minimize risk of collisions. Here we use measurements of body mass, wingspan and wing area of eight European raptor species, to calculate their Best Glide Ratio (BGR). The BGR was used to construct a linear equation, which, by the use of initial take-off altitude, could be used to calculate a Theoretical Maximum Distance (TMD) from the coast, attained by these soaring-gliding raptor species. If the nearest turbine, of future marine wind farms, is placed farther away from the coast than the estimated TMD, the collision risk between the turbine blades and these gliding raptors will be minimized. The tool was demonstrated in a case study at the Rodsand II wind farm in Denmark. Data on raptor migration altitude were gathered by radar. From the TMD attained by registered soaring-gliding raptors in the area, we concluded that the Rodsand II wind farm is not sited ideally, from an ornithological point of view, as potentially all three registered species are at risk of gliding through the area swept by the turbine rotor blades, and thereby at risk of colliding with the wind turbines.",,,,,,,,,9,0,0,0,6,0,10,,,0364-152X,1432-1009,,,,,,,,,,"Aarhus Univ, Dept Biol, DK-8000 Aarhus, DenmarkAarhus Univ, Dept Wildlife Ecol & Biodivers, Natl Environm Res Inst, DK-8410 Ronde, Denmark",,,,2010-11-01,WOS:000283360300013,20711780,

Substantially more fishes, and higher densities, were observed at Holly (17,533, 636 per 100 m(-2), respectively) than at A (1,185, 171 per 100 m(2)). Although there were similarities, the dominant species at the two plat-forms were distinct. Rockfishes (genus Sebastes), particularly Sebastes hopkinsi, dominated the Holly assemblage, while the damselfish, Chromis punctipinnis, was the most abundant at A. Overall, at both platforms, there was no statistical difference between fish densities at conductors and at crossbeams and fish densities were higher at both conductors and crossbeams when compared to those in blue water. The species assemblage among three habitats were similar, although there were two survey occasions where no fish were observed in blue water.

Seven 5 km long transects were sampled using a towed camera sled with a downward-facing digital camera that captured images at 5 frames∙s-1s. Additional small-mesh beam trawling was also conducted at selected locations complementary for species identification.. Image data were analyzed using two image selection methods, random and systematic (i.e. video frames were selected at various intervals). For both methods, estimates of community diversity (Hills N2) stabilized with sample sizes ranging from 316 to 398 frames. Our results allowed us to define distinct epibenthic communities and bottom habitats that are associated with offshore wind energy sites and to develop a sampling technique for digital images that can be applied to other research programs.

However, as the installation of wind farms rises, so will the need for decommissioning and analysis of the environmental impacts associated with decommissioning. This paper investigates how Environmental Impacts Assessments (EIA) identify, estimate and manage potential impacts of decommissioning. EIAs from 12 onshore and offshore windfarms consented between 2009 and 2014 in England and Scotland were analysed and compared. Attributes of these windfarms' Environmental Statements (ES) were scored under six categories: decommissioning in EIA stages, definitions of decommissioning, amount of analysis, depth of analysis, impacts identified, and proactive planning. Onshore windfarms generally tended to investigate the impacts of decommissioning less than offshore windfarms, even those which gained consent in the same year. The investigation of the impact of decommissioning improved for windfarms consented in the latter years of the study period. Across the ESs there was a lack of analysis of potential impacts from decommissioning in their own right: not simply as a reversal of the construction process. The impacts of different end of life scenarios were not analysed in any of the ESs studied. There is evidence to suggest the presence of windfarms, especially offshore, could in some cases be environmentally beneficial for certain species. However, the ecological impact of removing offshore structures at the end of life is unknown and is currently not investigated nor predicted in EIAs. Understanding the potential implications of full or partial removal of marine structures, or alternatives to decommissioning, could ensure that appropriate mitigation is considered at an early stage by both developer and consenting authority. That being said, it is also important to update the assessment of potential impacts over the life of the project as more information on the environment is gathered and end of life plans develop.",,,,,,,,,19,1,0,0,2,1,20,,,0195-9255,1873-6432,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Strathclyde, Technol & Innovat Ctr, Level 4,99 George St, Glasgow G1 1RD, Lanark, ScotlandUniv Strathclyde, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Level 5,James Weir 8 Bldg 75 Montrose St, Glasgow G1 1XJ, Lanark, Scotland",,,,2020-06-11,WOS:000536130100013,,

Key findings The genus Tubastraea (Order Scleractinia, Family Dendrophylliidae) (known as sun corals) presents compounds with pharmacological value. The introduction of these azooxanthellate hard corals into Brazil, initially in Rio de Janeiro state, occurred through their fouling of oil and gas platforms from the Campos oil Basin. The two invasive species have successfully expanded along the Brazilian coast and threaten endemic species and biodiversity. The HPLC-MS and GC-MS data suggest the presence of aplysinopsin analogues (alkaloids). Anti-inflammatory activity was observed in all samples tested in in-vivo assays, especially in T. coccinea. The ethyl acetate fraction from this sample was more effective in in-vitro assays for anti-inflammatory activity. Depending on the concentration, this fraction showed cytotoxic responses.

As the industry begins to decommission its offshore structures, this information will be critical for avoiding duplication of effort in data collection and ensuring best environmental management of offshore activities. This paper summarises the outcomes of a Blue Growth Data Challenge Workshop held in 2017 with participants from: the oil and gas industry; the key UK regulatory and management bodies for oil and gas decommissioning; open access data facilitators; and academic and research institutes. Here, environmental data collection and archiving by oil and gas operators in the North Sea are described, alongside how this compares to other offshore industries; what the barriers and opportunities surrounding environmental data sharing are; and how wider data sharing from offshore industries could be achieved. Five primary barriers to data sharing were identified: 1) Incentives, 2) Risk Perception, 3) Working Cultures, 4) Financial Models, and 5) Data Ownership.

The development of offshore wind farms in the area would provide hard substrata for the settlement of sessile benthos. Since the seafloor of the Adriatic is predominantly sedimentary this may alter the larval connectivity of benthic populations in the region. Here, we simulated the release of larvae from benthic populations along the coasts of the Adriatic Sea using coupled bio-physical models and investigated the effect of pelagic larval duration on dispersal. Our model simulations show that currents typically carry particles from east to west across the Adriatic, whereas particles released along western coasts tend to remain there with the Puglia coast of Italy acting as a sink for larvae from benthic populations. We identify areas of high connectivity, as well as areas that are much more isolated, and discuss how these results can be used to inform marine spatial planning and the licensing of offshore marine renewable energy developments.

The early recruitment and succession of the epibenthic communities were sampled once a month for the first 5 months and then again after 1 year. Further, the fish assemblages associated with the pillars were sampled and compared to natural areas. The main epibenthic species groups, in terms of coverage, differed between the two materials at five out of six sampling occasions. Dominant organisms on steel pillars were the barnacle Balanus improvisus, the calcareous tubeworm Pomatoceros triqueter and the tunicate Ciona intestinalis. On the concrete pillars, the hydroid Laomedea sp. and the tunicates Corella parallelogramma and Ascidiella spp. dominated. However, there was no different in coverage at different heights on the pillars or in biomass and species abundance at different directions (north-east or south-west) 5 months after submergence. Fish showed overall higher abundances and species numbers on the pillars (but no difference between steel and concrete) compared to the surrounding soft bottom habitats but not compared to natural vertical rock walls. Two species were attracted to the pillars, indicating a reef effect; Gobiusculus flavescens and Ctenolabrus rupestris.

This study aims to develop a time-dependant corrosion wastage model for aging subsea gas pipeline. The empirical model is formulated by applying the effect of exposure time to probability density distribution parameters using the 3-Parameter Weibull distribution function. The developed empirical model will give simplification on the prediction of the pit depth of a gas pipeline at any given age by manipulating the scale, shape and location parameter of the probability density distribution with respect to time.

Here we report on contrasting characteristics of three sea-breeze types on five coastlines around the southern North Sea from an 11 year model-simulated climatology. We present and test an identification method which distinguishes sea-breeze types which can, in principle, be adapted for other coastlines around the world. The coherence of the composite results for each type demonstrates that the method is very effective in resolving and distinguishing characteristics and features. Some features, such as jets and calm zones, are shown to influence offshore wind farm development areas, including the sites of the proposed wind farms up to 200 km offshore. A large variability in sea-breeze frequency between neighbouring coastlines of up to a factor of 3 is revealed. Additionally, there is a strong association between sea-breeze type on one coastline and that which may form coincidentally on another nearby. This association can be as high as 86% between, for example, the North Norfolk and East Norfolk coasts. We show, through associations between sea-breeze events on coastlines with contrasting orientations, that each coastline can be important for influencing the wind climate of another. Furthermore, we highlight that each sea-breeze type needs separate consideration in wind power resource assessment and that future larger turbines will be more sensitive to sea-breeze impacts.",,,,,,,,,40,0,0,0,3,0,46,,,0035-9009,1477-870X,,,,,,,,,,"Univ E Anglia, Sch Environm Sci, Norwich NR4 7TJ, Norfolk, EnglandUniv E Anglia, Sch Environm Sci, Weatherquest Ltd, Norwich NR4 7TJ, Norfolk, England",,,,2015-09-16,WOS:000360203800026,,

An acoustic deterrence device (seal scarer) was used to protect porpoises from hearing loss and bubble curtains were used to attenuate the pile-driving noise. Porpoise occurrence, quantified by echolocation signals, decreased when the seal scarer was engaged, during pile driving and up to 5 h after pile driving stopped. This effect extended out to 12 km, less than the 18-25 km reported from other pile drivings performed without bubble curtains. The bubble curtains thus effectively reduced the temporary habitat loss and risk of hearing loss. The 2 bubble curtains each attenuated the noise by between 7 and 10 dB, when used separately, and 12 dB when used together. Attenuation was most pronounced above 1 kHz, where the pile-driving noise at larger distances was comparable to or lower than ambient noise. This suggests that noise regulation should be based on frequency-weighted sound levels in addition to broadband levels, to assure that mitigation measures are effective in reducing impact on animals and not only in fulfilling legal requirements. The strong reaction to the seal scarer raises concern that it may surpass the reactions to the pile-driving noise itself, when operating with bubble curtains, and calls for a re-evaluation of the specifications of seal scarer sounds.",,,,,,,,,47,0,0,0,32,0,48,,,0171-8630,1616-1599,,,,,,,,,,"Aarhus Univ, Dept Biosci, Frederiksborgvej 399, DK-4000 Roskilde, DenmarkGerman Oceanog Museum, Katharinenberg 14-20, D-18439 Stralsund, GermanyBioConsult SH GmbH & Co KG, Schobuller Str 36, D-25813 Husum, Germany",German Oceanog MuseumBioConsult SH GmbH & Co KG,,,2017-09-29,WOS:000419091500014,,

Results show that the turbine wake has an impact on both, the ocean and the sediment layers. The turbine wake impacts the ocean surface and generates instabilities or vortex streets for some parameter values. Shallow ocean layers (typically below 15m) are laminar. When water depth is higher, large scale instabilities are generated, leading to a turbulent dynamic in the ocean layer. The size of the generated vortices in the ocean increases with water depth and decreases with the quadratic-law bottom friction coefficient. Considering the morphodynamics three cases are observed, depending on whether the ocean dynamics is laminar (i), has a localized (ii) or domain wide (iii) turbulent behavior. In the first case, changes in seabed elevation are around a few millimeters per month. Results are similar for the localized turbulence case with small spatial variations. For the domain wide turbulence case (iii), instantaneous seabed changes are of the order of a few millimeters per month, whereas the transport averaged over several days decreases to a few tenths of millimeter per month. This behavior is easily explained by the oscillating local velocity which transports sediments back and forth. The above emphasizes that the water depth is a key parameter for the coupled atmosphere-ocean-sediment system around wind turbines. Furthermore, considering the ocean velocity in the atmospheric forcing at the ocean surface leads to a decrease of 4 % of the power lost by friction at the atmosphere-ocean interface. Ocean dynamics could thus have a non-negligible feedback on the wind power available for the turbines and its variability.",,,,,36th IAHR World Congress36th IAHR World Congress,"JUN 28-JUL 03, 2015JUN 28-JUL 03, 2015","Int Assoc Hydro Environm Engn & Res; Boskalis; Van Oord; UNESCO IHE; Delft Univ Technol; Deltares; Minist Infrastructure & Environm, Rijkswaterstaat; Royal HaskoningDHV; ARCADIS; WItteveen Bos; AANDERAA; Prince Sultan Bin Abulaziz Int Prize WaterInt Assoc Hydro Environm Engn & Res; Boskalis; Van Oord; UNESCO IHE; Delft Univ Technol; Deltares; Minist Infrastructure & Environm, Rijkswaterstaat; Royal HaskoningDHV; ARCADIS; WItteveen Bos; AANDERAA; Prince Sultan Bin Abulaziz Int Prize Water","Delft, NETHERLANDSDelft, NETHERLANDS",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,978-90-824846-0-1,,,,,,,,,"LEGI Domaine Univ, BP 53, F-38041 Grenoble 9, France",LEGI Domaine Univ,,,2015-01-01,WOS:000398996201057,,

Despite the lack of study of natural reefs and banks in the Gulf, these areas are believed to be the historical centers of Red Snapper abundance. This study sampled Red Snapper from habitats that include reefs located more than 125 km offshore, making them difficult to reach for routine sampling. The results indicate significant differences in Red Snapper reproductive biology between females collected on adjacent artificial and natural habitats. Annual fecundity estimates were almost 20-fold higher in fish collected from natural habitats.

Fully coupled aero-hydro-servo-elastic numerical models of FOWT-SFFC, with and without nets, are constructed to probe the nonlinear time-domain stochastic response. The first-order potential flow model with quadratic drag forces is employed to calculate the hydrodynamic loading on the foundation. The effects of nets on the damping ratios of 6 degree-of-freedom motions and on their displacement response amplitude operators (RAOs) are respectively investigated in numerical decay tests and monochromatic regular waves. The results show that the nets help to increase the damping level for the whole system and reduce motion RAOs when wave periods are around the natural periods of motions, while nets play insignificant role in motions when wave periods are far away from motion natural periods. The dynamic performances of FOWT-SFFC with and without nets under random ocean waves, the combined random wind and random waves as well as current are comprehensively compared and discussed. The simulation results indicate that in wind-sea dominated conditions, the nets tend to slightly increase the dynamic responses of FOWT-SFFC, especially the components corresponding to natural periods. Nonetheless, under sea states that comprise both wind-sea waves and swell, nets help to reduce the dynamic responses of FOWT-SFFC by introducing additional damping.",,,,,,,,,23,2,0,0,1,0,25,,,0219-4554,1793-6764,,,,,,,,,,"Tsinghua Univ, Dept Civil Engn, Beijing 100084, Peoples R ChinaTsinghua Univ, Shenzhen Int Grad Sch, Div Ocean Sci & Technol, Shenzhen 518055, Peoples R ChinaPOWERCHINA Huadong Engn Corp Ltd, Hangzhou 310014, Peoples R ChinaKey Lab Far Shore Wind Power Technol Zhejiang Pro, Hangzhou 310014, Peoples R China",Key Lab Far Shore Wind Power Technol Zhejiang Pro,,,2020-06-11,WOS:000531730400015,,

This study provides an assessment of Alaska's offshore wind resource, the first such assessment for Alaska, using a 14-year, high-resolution simulation from a numerical weather prediction and regional climate model. This is the longest-known high-resolution model data set to be used in a wind resource assessment. Widespread areas with relatively shallow ocean depth and high long-term average 100-m wind speeds and estimated net capacity factors over 50% were found, including a small area near Alaska's population centers and the largest transmission grid that, if even partially developed, could provide the bulk of the state's energy needs. The regional climate simulations were validated against available radiosonde and surface wind observations to provide the confidence of the model-based assessment.

Whether there is a statistical significant correspondence between the environmental measurements and the biological changes is tested after quantifying the biological changes by using the community disturbance index (CDI). Finally, the environmental variables that are most strongly associated with the biological changes are identified, and it is proposed that these are strong candidates as the pollutants responsible for the biological changes observed.

The structural assessment of the wind turbine supporting structure accounts for the interaction between various loads and response effects. The primary concern related to the possibility that structural components are subjected to high level of cyclic stresses compared to the yield point of the material is in respect to ageing structures or when the stress concentration factor exceeds a high level or both. The aging of structures involves an interaction between corrosion, fatigue and plastic deformations. Damage accumulation is much higher and occurs at a faster rate if the structural components are subjected to high level of cycle fatigue load. The presence of abnormal waves in the open ocean lead to low cycle fatigue, which is characterized by a high level of amplitude and low frequency plastic strains. Thus, an interaction between low cycle fatigue damage and remaining strength is considered for identifying the safety of offshore wind turbine supporting structures.",,,,,16th International Congress of the International-Maritime-Association-of-the-Mediterranean (IMAM) - Towards Green Marine Technology and Transport16th International Congress of the International-Maritime-Association-of-the-Mediterranean (IMAM) - Towards Green Marine Technology and Transport,"SEP 21-24, 2015SEP 21-24, 2015",Int Maritime Assoc MediterraneanInt Maritime Assoc Mediterranean,"Pula, CROATIAPula, CROATIA",6,1,0,0,0,0,6,,,,,978-1-138-02887-6; 978-1-315-64349-6,,,,,,,,,"Univ Lisbon, Ctr Marine Technol & Ocean Engn CENTEC, Inst Super Tecn, Lisbon, Portugal",,,,2015-01-01,WOS:000505749600034,,

Slower maturation rates ( among fish <= 6 years old), lower GSI values and decreased spawning frequency were observed, and were especially pronounced in the northwestern Gulf. Furthermore, an Index of Reproductive Importance showed that young fish (ages 2-7) are contributing far less to the spawning stock in recent years, while older fish (> 8 years) are contributing more, when compared to fish from the same age groups sampled in the previous decade. Coincident with these changes in reproductive output, fishing pressure has steadily declined gulf-wide, and spawning stock biomass and spawning potential ratio have increased. Thus, it is possible that the age structure of the red snapper stock is becoming less truncated, or that reproductive effort observed is due to the temporary influence of recent strong year classes produced in 2004 and 2006 as they begin to reach full reproductive potential. If the latter is true, careful documentation of the stock's reproductive dynamics during a time of population growth provides new understanding at the meta-population spatial and decadal temporal scales. In contrast, if the former is true, a truncated age structure due to overharvest can limit the productivity of the Gulf red snapper stock. In addition, we have learned that red snapper females in the northwestern Gulf collected on natural reefs and banks have much higher reproductive output than those on artificial reefs in the form of standing and toppled oil and gas platforms, thus making the need to know the relative abundance of females found on these disparate habitats an important next step toward better-understanding factors impacting the reproductive dynamics of this species.",,,,,,,,,22,1,0,0,21,0,25,,,1932-6203,,,,,,,,,,,"Louisiana State Univ, Dept Oceanog & Coastal Sci, Baton Rouge, LA 70803 USAUniv S Alabama, Dept Marine Sci, Mobile, AL 36688 USATexas A&M Corpus Christi, Dept Life Sci, Corpus Christi, TX 78412 USA",,,,2017-03-29,WOS:000399174600003,28355239,

The S. spinulosa reefs were identified in the acoustic data as areas of distinct irregular texturing. Maps created using acoustic data were validated using quantitative measures of reef quality, namely tube density (as a proxy for the density of live S. spinulosa), percentage cover of S. spinulosa structures (both living and dead) and associated macrofauna derived from seabed images taken across the development site. Statistically significant differences were observed in all physical measures of S. spinulosa as well the number (S) and diversity (H') of associated species, derived from seabed images classified according to the presence or absence of reef, validating the use of high resolution sidescan sonar to map these important biogenic habitats. High precision mapping in the early stages allowed for the micro-siting of wind turbines in a way that caused minimal damage to S. spinulosa reefs during construction. These habitats have since recovered and expanded in extent. The surveys undertaken at the Thanet Offshore Windfarm site demonstrate the importance of repeat mapping for this emerging industry, allowing habitat enhancement to be attributed to the development whilst preventing background habitat degradation from being wrongly attributed to the development.

The codes verified herein account for the coupled dynamic systems including the wind inflow, aerodynamics, elasticity and controls of the turbine, along with the incident waves, sea current, hydrodynamics and foundation dynamics of the support structure.A large set of time series simulation results such as turbine operational characteristics, external conditions, and load and displacement outputs was compared and interpreted. Load cases were defined and run with increasing complexity to trace back differences in simulation results to the underlying error sources. This led to a deeper understanding of the underlying physical systems. In four subsequent phasesdealing with a 5-MW turbine on a monopile with a fixed foundation, a monopile with a flexible foundation, a tripod and a floating spar buoythe latest support structure developments in the offshore wind energy industry are covered, and an adaptation of the codes to those developments was initiated.The comparisons, in general, agreed quite well. Differences existed among the predictions were traced back to differences in the model fidelity, aerodynamic implementation, hydrodynamic load discretization and numerical difficulties within the codes. The comparisons resulted in a more thorough understanding of the modeling techniques and better knowledge of when various approximations are not valid. More importantly, the lessons learned from this exercise have been used to further develop and improve the codes of the participants and increase the confidence in the codes' accuracy and the correctness of the results, hence improving the standard of offshore wind turbine modeling and simulation.One purpose of this paper is to summarize the lessons learned and present results that code developers can compare to.

Despite that no measurements are included, the large number of participants and thein generalvery fine level of agreement indicate high trustworthy results within the physical assumptions of the codes and the simulation cases chosen.

Surveys of predefined areas using aerial or boat-based transect surveys may not allow adequate assessment of the relative importance of different areas to birds. Individual-based satellite or radio-telemetry can be effective in identifying foraging ranges and preferred areas, but may not be suitable for some species. We developed a method to determine the foraging movements of breeding terns (Sterna spp.) by visually tracking individuals using a rigid-hulled inflatable boat (RHIB). Sandwich Terns (S. sandvicensis), Common Terns (S. hirundo), and Arctic Terns (S. paradisaea) were tracked from colonies in Norfolk and Anglesey, United Kingdom, from 2006 to 2008. The proportion of complete (from and to colony) trips varied from 29-60% among species, years, and colonies. Individual Sandwich Terns were tracked for periods up to 126 min over distances up to 72 km and as far as 54 km from the breeding colony, further than Arctic (up to 57 km and 29 km from the colony) and Common (to 29 km and < 9 km from the colony) terns. Mean values were much smaller. Multivariate modeling of Sandwich Tern foraging trips indicated that flight speeds > 50 km/hr coupled with greater distances from shore (> 25 km) significantly reduced the likelihood of tracking a bird for an entire foraging trip. Use of different boats that differ in speed and performance may alleviate such issues. Visual tracking allowed us to collect data on foraging behavior, flight height, and prey capture rates, and also permitted comparisons between species. Our results indicate that visual tracking may be an effective means of determining the foraging movements and at-sea behavior of a variety of short-ranging, day-active seabirds.",,,,,,,,,26,0,0,0,27,0,31,,,0273-8570,,,,,,,,,,,"ECON Ecol Consultancy Ltd, Norwich NR4 7UH, Norfolk, England",ECON Ecol Consultancy Ltd,,,2011-03-20,WOS:000287670700008,,

Bird mortality has been documented due to impact on the structure, oiling and incineration by the flare. The environmental circumstances for offshore hydrocarbon development in North-west Atlantic are unique because of the harsh climate, cold waters and because enormous seabird concentrations inhabit and move through the Grand Banks in autumn (storm-petrels, Oceanodroma spp), winter (dovekies, Alle alle, murres, Uria spp), spring and summer (shearwaters, Puffinus spp). Many species are planktivorous and attracted to artificial tight sources. Most of the seabirds in the region are long-distance migrants, and hydrocarbon development in the North-west Atlantic could affect both regional and global breeding populations. Regulators need to take responsibility for these circumstances. It is essential to implement comprehensive, independent arm's length monitoring of potential avian impacts of offshore hydrocarbon platforms in the North-west Atlantic. This should include quantifying and determining the nature, timing and extent of bird mortality caused by these structures. Based on existing evidence of potential impacts of offshore hydrocarbon platforms on seabirds, it is difficult to understand why this has not been, and is not being, systematically implemented.

Risk for population impacts may exist to soaring migrants such as raptors with K-strategic life-history characteristics. Soaring migrants display strong dependence on thermals and updrafts and an affinity to land areas and islands during their migration, a behaviour that creates corridors where raptors move across narrow straits and sounds and are attracted to islands. Several migration corridors for soaring birds overlap with the development regions for marine wind farms in NW Europe. However, no empirical data have yet been available on avoidance or attraction rates and behavioural reactions of soaring migrants to marine wind farms. Based on a post-construction monitoring study, we show that all raptor species displayed a significant attraction behaviour towards a wind farm. The modified migratory behaviour was also significantly different from the behaviour at nearby reference sites. The attraction was inversely related to distance to the wind farm and was primarily recorded during periods of adverse wind conditions. The attraction behaviour suggests that migrating raptor species are far more at risk of colliding with wind turbines at sea than hitherto assessed.

Then, the effects of the frequency dependent hydrodynamic coefficients and the axial Froude-Krylov force on slender members are clarified by the free decay tests and water tank tests with regular and irregular waves. Finally, the dynamic behavior of mooring system on the fairlead tension is investigated by using quasi-static and dynamic models, respectively.

Based on Fifth-Order Stokes wave theory a user-defined function is developed and used for wave numerical modeling, and a numerical wave tank with different bottom slopes is developed. The effects of different types of breaking waves, such as spilling and plunging waves, on the wave run-up, pressure distribution and horizontal wave force of a large diameter monopile are investigated. Different numerical and analytical methods for calculating the wave breaking loads are used and their results are compared with the relevant results of the developed computational fluid dynamics model and their respective scopes of application are discussed. With an increase in wave height, the change in the hydrodynamic performance of breaking waves observed through the transition from plunging to spilling waves is explored. The intensity of interactions occurring between the breaking waves and the monopile foundation depends mainly on the form of wave breaking involved and its relationship to wave steepness is weak. Analytical methods for calculating the breaking wave loads are preservative especially for plunging breaking wave loads.

There is a rapid increase in the number of wind farms at suitable sites all over the country. Some of the key sites with optimal wind velocities are the plateaus on the Western Ghats - a global hotspot of biological diversity. The rocky plateaus on the Western Ghats are terrestrial habitat islands facing extreme micro-environmental conditions; however, scanty information is available on the ecology of these plateaus. We undertook a two-year study to assess the impact of wind farms on birds. We also documented the avian diversity at Bhambarwadi Plateau, northern Western Ghats, India. To the best of our knowledge this is the first such study in India. We recorded 89 avian species on the plateau, 27 of which flew in the risk area swept by the rotor blades, and hence are potentially at risk of collision. The collision index (the number of bird collisions with wind turbines over a period of one year assuming that the birds do not take any avoidance measure) for these species were estimated. We also identified species at risk from collision with transformers and wind-masts, and at risk from electrocution. Reduction in avian activity in the study area was evident with progress of wind farm erection. Despite the small footprint of an individual wind turbine, the associated infrastructure development causes wider habitat modification and destruction resulting in a displacement effect. Therefore, wind farm erections in strategic locations such as biodiversity hotspots should be subject to prior site based strategic environmental assessments (SEA) as well as environmental impact assessment (EIA) studies.",,,,,,,,,8,0,0,0,12,0,14,,,0974-7893,0974-7907,,,,,,,,,,"Ela Fdn, C-9,Bhosale Pk,Sahakarnagar 2, Pune 411009, Maharashtra, India",,,,2013-03-29,BCI:BCI201300269368,,

Although density-dependent regulation of population growth is thought to be relatively widespread in nature, density-independent models are often used to project the population response to drivers of change. Such models are often considered to provide a maximum estimate of mortality and therefore offer a precautionary approach to impact assessment. However, this perception assumes that density dependence operates as compensatory (negative density dependence), and overlooks that other forms of density dependence, such as depensation (positive density dependence), would generate a contrasting population response.2. Currently, there is debate about including density-dependent mechanisms in models that assess the impact of offshore wind farms on marine bird populations. Density dependence is considered poorly understood for this group of species. Consequently, it is either excluded from assessments, or incorporated in a compensatory form that has little empirical validation.3. We reviewed the evidence for compensatory and depensatory regulation of 31 marine bird species, and conducted a meta-analysis to examine the functional shape of density-dependent population growth. The evidence was also evaluated in relation to established species-specific indices of wind farm vulnerability in order to assess whether compensatory mechanisms are likely to offset losses associated with collision or displacement.4. Compensatory regulation was reported across all of the demographic processes and focal groups considered, and was attributed to a variety of causal mechanisms. The strength of compensatory population growth appeared consistent between colonies; however, the regulation of productivity was highly context-dependent with a similar number of studies reporting compensatory, depensatory and insignificant effects. Depensation was consistently attributed to increased rates of predation at lower population densities.5. Synthesis and applications. We conclude that among marine bird species with high vulnerability to wind farms, compensatory regulation is unlikely to offset large and sustained losses from the breeding population. In addition, depensation has the potential to accelerate population declines and generate local or regional extinctions, especially in smaller colonial species. Consequently, density-independent models will not offer a consistently precautionary approach for assessing the potential impact of wind farms on marine bird populations. Instead, assessments should examine the potential population response using a range of density-dependent structures.",,,,,,,,,20,0,0,0,16,0,21,,,0021-8901,1365-2664,,,,,,,,,,"British Trust Ornithol, Thetford IP24 2PU, Norfolk, EnglandJoint Nat Conservat Comm, Inverdee House,Baxter St, Aberdeen AB11 9QA, Scotland",Joint Nat Conservat Comm,,,2017-10-01,WOS:000410678700013,,

Both in situ datasets revealed that the SPM plumes were generated at the turbine piles, consistent with aerial and space-borne imagery. The SPM plumes are well aligned with the tidal current direction in the wake of the monopiles, concentrations being estimated to reach up to 5 times that of the background concentration of about 3 mg/l. It is suggested that the epifaunal communities colonizing the monopile surface and the protective rock collar at the base play a key role as source of the suspended matter recorded in the plumes. The organisms filter and trap fine SPM from the water column, resulting in predominant accumulation of SPM, including detritus and (pseudo-) faeces, at the base of the piles. When tidal currents exceed a certain velocity, fine particles in the near-bed fluff layer are re-suspended and transported downstream in the wake of the piles.",,,,,,,,,33,0,0,0,15,0,34,,,0276-0460,1432-1157,,,,,,,,,,"Royal Belgian Inst Nat Sci, Operat Directorate Nat Environm, B-1200 Brussels, Belgium",,,,2015-08-01,WOS:000357662500001,,

This article describes the results of an investigation into the zooplankton community and the main environmental factors affecting that community based on data obtained from three cruises in May, August, and November of 2015 in the area of the Longyuan OWF in Rudong, China. This study analyzed the spatiotemporal distribution of zooplankton, including data obtained before the construction of the wind farm, to assess any postconstruction change in the zooplankton community. Data from the zooplankton community were analyzed using canonical correlation analysis, redundancy analysis, and multiple regression analysis. The analysis indicates that the presence of the wind turbine foundations reduced the quantity of the macrozooplankton significantly (the percentage of change was 96.87% in the autumn, and 26.70% in the spring), and reduced the biomass slightly in autumn (the percentage of change was -58.20%) or increased the biomass in the spring (the percentage of change was 75.77%). However, the quantity of the microzooplankton significantly increased (the percentage of change was 542.76% in the spring) or decreased slightly (the percentage of change was -86.25% in the autumn). The water also showed a postconstruction trend toward eutrophication in this study area. The data also showed that water temperature, dissolved oxygen, suspended matter concentration, and pH were the most important factors influencing the zooplankton community. The suspended-matter concentration had opposite effects on the macrozooplankton and microzooplankton, suggesting that the postconstruction zooplankton community might show a trend toward miniaturization.",,,,,,,,,8,1,0,0,5,0,10,,,0749-0208,1551-5036,,,,,,,,,,"Nanjing Univ, Sch Geog & Oceanog Sci, Nanjing 210023, Jiangsu, Peoples R ChinaNanjing Univ, Minist Educ, Key Lab Coastal & Isl Dev, Nanjing 210023, Jiangsu, Peoples R ChinaMarine Fisheries Res Inst Jiangsu Prov, Nantong 226007, Peoples R ChinaOcean Univ China, Sch Chem & Chem Engn, Qingdao 266100, Peoples R China",Marine Fisheries Res Inst Jiangsu Prov,,,2018-07-24,WOS:000438448400007,,

It is assumed the response with a return period of T years occurs during a sea-state with a shorter or equal return period. This provides good extreme response estimates for structures with a response behaviour monotonically increasing with the severity of the sea-state. For an offshore wind turbine, the power production stops at a certain wind speed to reduce wear, changing the dynamics of the system dramatically, from wind to wave load dominated. Also, there is a non-negligible probability for the turbine being unable to operate although the wind speeds would suggest so, due to e.g. grid- or mechanical failure. Therefore, the original contour-line method for extreme response estimation is not applicable without some modifications to account for changing dynamics. In the present work, it is suggested to treat the operational and non-operational conditions as two sub-populations and estimate the T-year response in each population by a standard contour-line method.

Research and development activity under the programme commenced in April 2010 and is expected to be completed during 2015.What will it deliver?The participants have come together to address the technology challenges facing the offshore wind sector. For example the programme will make use of pioneering hydraulic drive technology, developed in the UK, to produce an innovative drive train system designed for application in a high power offshore wind turbine, specifically in the Mitsubishi SeaAngel™ class of wind turbine under development. Many elements of offshore wind farm design will be researched from the perspective of reducing the cost of energy, including; capital cost, reliability, availability, electrical generation and grid compliance, transport and installation, substructure design and installation, operation and maintenance, and health and safety.Why is it unique?Technical collaboration between leading members of the value chain at such an early stage is unusual. By collaborating with their combined experience and expertise, the consortium will be better equipped to make more effective design decisions. This will contribute to a better understanding and management of the interfaces and specific challenges in offshore wind power. It will also improve efficiency within all areas of the value chain, from design development to through-life operation and therefore provide a contribution to reducing the overall cost of energy.How will it benefit the UK?The UK is the largest offshore wind market in the world and is keen to become a world leader in offshore wind technology. It is intended that the programme will boost confidence to the market and help the industry and Government deliver the vision for offshore wind namely; competitively priced renewable energy and wider economic and environmental benefits. The Programme will enhance the ability of the UK to deliver ‘Round 3’ offshore wind farm developments as well as making a contribution towards the development of the emerging UK offshore wind supply chain. The Programme will help prove the viability of offshore wind and enhance the position of the United Kingdom as a centre of excellence for offshore wind.What are the specific research areas?The Efficient Offshore Wind Programme comprises a number of projects:Hydraulic Digital Displacement® drive train development:• Artemis Intelligent Power, since 2010 a group company of MPSE, is working with Mitsubishi engineers to create a digitally controlled, highly responsive hydraulic wind turbine transmission. The hydraulic transmission obviates the need to use traditional gearbox and frequency converter. As these two items are often the source of faults in a wind turbine, substituting them is intended to improve reliability, maintainability and ultimately reduce the cost of energy.• Wind, and particularly offshore wind, is an application area where the legendary robustness of hydraulic transmissions is desirable, however it has to date been rejected for this application primarily due to its low part-load efficiency. Digital Displacement® Technology was created to address this deficiency; the Efficient Offshore Wind Programme provides an exciting opportunity to scale up this technology to the demanding high power and performance levels of offshore wind.• With its infinitely variable transmission ratio, a Digital Displacement® transmission can be coupled with the varying low-speed wind-turbine rotor to one or more high constant-speed, medium voltage, wound-rotor, synchronous generators. These are the same kind of machines that are used in conventional power stations where they are renowned for their ability to provide network support and for their graceful behaviour during transient network faults.• Digital Displacement® machines have a fully modular construction which offers the opportunity that if necessary almost all components can be swapped out from within the wind turbine nacelle. This is an important advantage in offshore wind-turbines where it is essential to carry out maintenance without costly support from crane barges or jack-up vessels. The high degree of integration between the electronic and mechanical components of Digital Displacement® machines will provide inbuilt performance and condition monitoring. This is particularly important in offshore wind where a very long design life is sought, service intervals are infrequent and technician access may not be possible for weeks at a time.Supply chain development and risk mitigation• In the development of novel technology it is vitally important that the supply chain is engaged at an early stage so that it understands the requirements of the new technology, and is able to deliver the required innovation whilst balancing quality improvement and cost reduction challenges as the project develops and moves into the exploitation stage.• The consortium partners all share the Government's desire to see the localisation of the supply chain and will work through this programme to engage with the industry. Contributing towards a strong local supply chain is one of the key ways in which the UK can attract the wider economic benefits of offshore wind, whilst also helping to enhance its viability.• A further element of the project will investigate ways of reducing the number of interfaces between equipment from different suppliers and to increase standardisation across the value chain, through collaboration between the consortium partners at this early stage.• In the development of new technology it is critical to understand how it can be exploited and brought to the market. A key barrier to the deployment of new technology is its perceived risk in the eyes of the finance and insurance communities. Through early engagement with finance and insurance stakeholders this work package will help to reduce barriers to the deployment of new technology both through better understanding of the associated risks and through the development of risk mitigation strategies that reduce the associated insurance premium.Optimised substructure design• The substructure is affixed to the seabed and provides structural support to the wind turbine tower, as well as providing an interface route to the subsea cable connection. It must be capable of handling the loads imparted by the sea and weather conditions and from the wind turbine. In addition it is subject to the harsh marine environment, presenting material erosion and corrosion challenges during operational life.• The aim of this project is to develop an optimised substructure and transition piece concept for supporting large offshore wind turbines, suitable for low cost bulk manufacture and installation.• The end design will be adaptable to a range of water depths and sea-bed conditions through the utilisation of bespoke design codes that address both engineering and regulatory requirements, for example end of life decommissioning.Transport and installation, cable connection• This project will develop a viable range of concepts for electrical power connection from the wind turbine. This work will include the development of new methodologies for the sea bed installation of cable arrays, cable pull-in techniques, cable protection and connection.• In addition, this project will develop and document a range of competitive solutions for land-based logistics at the port and water-based logistics for transport and installation of Mitsubishi SeaAngel™ class wind turbines. These will be developed to fulfil Round 3 requirements such as medium volume production, representative distance from shore, wave height and water depth.Operation and maintenance, health and safety• To achieve an offshore wind farm design life of over twenty years, a sophisticated approach to operations and maintenance is required. The partners will seek to develop an integrated operations and maintenance strategy by drawing on their combined experience, particularly that derived from the oil and gas sector.• Within the Efficient Offshore Wind Programme, the operations and maintenance philosophy will be developed at an early stage in the design process. In this way it is intended that design decisions can be made in consideration of maintenance requirements to deliver enhanced operational efficiency.• The learning outcomes from the offshore oil and gas industry will be built upon in the development of operations and maintenance procedures. Health and safety risk identification, assessment and mitigation shall be carried out to validate all procedures to ensure that safety of operation and maintenance activity is prioritised.• Optimal component replacement strategies for key components on the offshore wind turbine will be developed with particular consideration to health and safety. These replacement strategies will, where possible be verified at an onshore demonstration site in the UK and if required further refined.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,110063,,,,,,,,"Mitsubishi Hitachi Power Systems Europe, Ltd.","Mitsubishi Hitachi Power Systems Europe, Ltd.",,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:15325588,,

The results show that the concentrations of these elements are highest near the platforms. The results of Enrichment Factor (EF) and Potential Ecological Risk Index (PERI) also reveal significantly higher enrichment around the platforms, which imply that the offshore petroleum production was the cause of the unusual distribution and severe enrichment of these elements in the study area.

The present work addresses this issue to propose environmental management measures connected to the utilization of fishery resources. Offshore and inshore surveys were carried out along the Saudi Gulf waters using trawl and beach-seine nets, respectively. Data relative to only fish (offshore) and fish and invertebrates (inshore) were collected concurrently with several factors: density of oil and gas facilities (offshore), distance to the nearest coastal platform (inshore), oceanographic variables, and habitat characteristics. Results of offshore surveys indicated higher fish density-both total and of fishery resources-in locations with a higher number of oil and gas facilities within a 5 km radius, whereas biomass density was not significantly different. Hence, oil and gas facilities seem to serve as nursery areas for small fish. For inshore communities, more species and diversity were found in stations closer to coastal oil and gas facilities. In addition, among the five coastal embayments sampled, those with more oil and gas facilities had more species. The findings of the present work support the hypothesis of a positive net ecological role of oil and gas platforms of the Saudi Arabian Gulf, with the implication that this effect could be extended to improve the sustainability of important fishery resources.",,,,,,,,,26,0,0,0,25,0,27,,,1054-3139,1095-9289,,,,,,,,,,"King Fahd Univ Petr & Minerals, Marine Studies Sect, Ctr Environm & Water, Res Inst, Dhahran 31261, Eastern Provinc, Saudi ArabiaAZTI Tecnalia, Marine Res Div, Pasaia 20110, SpainSaudi Aramco, Environm Protect Dept, Dhahran, Saudi Arabia",,,,2015-09-01,WOS:000368251600022,,

Of particular interest are the massive accumulations of rubble formed by shear or compression in the ice cover, which consolidate to form sea ice ridges that can be hazards to such structures. These are common ice features in Arctic and sub Arctic environments and as a result often govern the design loads for ships, coastal and offshore structures operating in these environments. In addition, ridge keels can scour the seafloor in relatively shallow waters posing a threat to pipelines and other subsea facilities. It is not clear what load an ice rubble feature can exert on a given structure and how it will deform. It will depend on a number of parameters including the age of the feature, its composition and structure, and its strength and failure behaviour. This paper will examine the mechanical properties of ice rubble over multiple scales. The paper will begin at the one block level, describing how ice block properties vary over time, before advancing to look at the bonding/sintering processes that occur between two ice blocks and eventually the processes that take place between multiple ice blocks (i.e., ice rubble) and large scale sea ice ridges.

In the marine environment there are multitude factors that influence the rate and severity of corrosion mechanisms. Marine environments are recognized to be very corrosive for mild and low alloy steels. The corrosion phenomenon it is a constant and continuous problem, often difficult to eliminate completely. Corrosion induced structural failures continue problem in many marine structures such as ship, platform oil rigs, offshore wind farm or port facilities. Sea water it is a complex chemical system which can be influenced by various factors. These include the concentration and access of dissolved oxygen, salinity, concentration of minor ions, biological activity or pollutants. Other factors which influence the rate and severity of corrosion mechanism are temperature, nutrient level, water velocity and depth. The prevention would be more practical and achievable than complete elimination. From an engineering point of view the major interest in corrosion is the kinetics or rate of corrosion process. The principal aim for studying the kinetics of corrosion reactions are to develop empirical relationship that permit the prediction of corrosion rate under conditions that are different from those originally employed and to determine the mechanism of the overall process of degradation. In this research work it is investigated comparatively the corrosion resistance of uncoated naval steel, naval steel coated with polymeric primer and naval steel coated with polymeric primer and epoxy paint layer. All samples have been subjected to corrosion in sea water collected from Black Sea.

During the transportation, the platform is semi-submersible and self-stabilized because it has a relatively large water plane area. Therefore, it can be wet-towed out together with the wind turbine from the quayside to the offshore installation site. During the operation phase, the platform is submerged with a relatively small water plane area, which improves its hydrodynamic performance. Hence, this STLP wind turbine requires low transportation and installation cost. It can also achieve a potentially good dynamic behavior during the operation phase. In this paper, the stability of the STLP wind turbine during the transportation phase is first assessed without considering the mooring lines. The results show that the STLP wind turbine has a good stability to ensure a safe wet towing. The dynamic responses of the slip wind turbine during the operation phase are then studied with emphasis on the effect of second-order wave loads, wind-wave misalignment and water depth. Based on fully coupled time domain simulations, it is found that the effect of second-order wave loads on the dynamics of the SUP wind turbine is slightly larger in an extreme sea state than that in a moderate sea state. The standard deviations of the surge, sway, roll and pitch motions and the tower base bending moment are dependent on the wind-wave misalignment, while those of the heave and yaw motions, the blade root bending moment are not. In addition, a larger water depth leads to larger standard deviations of the platform motions and a smaller standard deviation of the tower base bending moment. The effect of water depth on the blade root and tower top bending moments is negligible.",,,,,,,,,38,8,0,0,1,0,46,,,0029-8018,,,,,,,,,,,"Tianjin Univ, State Key Lab Hydraul Engn Simulat & Safety, Tianjin 300072, Peoples R ChinaTianjin Univ, Minist Educ, Key Lab Coast Civil Struct Safety, Tianjin 300072, Peoples R ChinaTianjin Univ, Sch Civil Engn, Tianjin 300072, Peoples R ChinaNTNU, Dept Marine Technol, Trondheim, Norway",,,,2017-03-08,WOS:000393241300006,,

J,,,,,,,,,,,The MPSE SeaAngel Programme: Project 1 Digital Displacement Transmission Design and Validation,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Awarded Grant,Mar 31 2010,2010,"Efficient Offshore Wind ProgrammeWhat is the Efficient Offshore Wind Programme?The Efficient Offshore Wind programme (EOW) is a collaborative research and development programme led by Mitsubishi Power Systems Europe with partners SSE, Technip Offshore Wind and Wood Group Renewables. Research and development activity under the programme commenced in April 2010 and is expected to be completed during 2015.What will it deliver?The participants have come together to address the technology challenges facing the offshore wind sector. For example the programme will make use of pioneering hydraulic drive technology, developed in the UK, to produce an innovative drive train system designed for application in a high power offshore wind turbine, specifically in the Mitsubishi SeaAngel™ class of wind turbine under development. Many elements of offshore wind farm design will be researched from the perspective of reducing the cost of energy, including; capital cost, reliability, availability, electrical generation and grid compliance, transport and installation, substructure design and installation, operation and maintenance, and health and safety.Why is it unique?Technical collaboration between leading members of the value chain at such an early stage is unusual. By collaborating with their combined experience and expertise, the consortium will be better equipped to make more effective design decisions. This will contribute to a better understanding and management of the interfaces and specific challenges in offshore wind power. It will also improve efficiency within all areas of the value chain, from design development to through-life operation and therefore provide a contribution to reducing the overall cost of energy.How will it benefit the UK?The UK is the largest offshore wind market in the world and is keen to become a world leader in offshore wind technology. It is intended that the programme will boost confidence to the market and help the industry and Government deliver the vision for offshore wind namely; competitively priced renewable energy and wider economic and environmental benefits. The Programme will enhance the ability of the UK to deliver ‘Round 3’ offshore wind farm developments as well as making a contribution towards the development of the emerging UK offshore wind supply chain. The Programme will help prove the viability of offshore wind and enhance the position of the United Kingdom as a centre of excellence for offshore wind.What are the specific research areas?The Efficient Offshore Wind Programme comprises a number of projects:Hydraulic Digital Displacement® drive train development:• Artemis Intelligent Power, since 2010 a group company of MPSE, is working with Mitsubishi engineers to create a digitally controlled, highly responsive hydraulic wind turbine transmission. The hydraulic transmission obviates the need to use traditional gearbox and frequency converter. As these two items are often the source of faults in a wind turbine, substituting them is intended to improve reliability, maintainability and ultimately reduce the cost of energy.• Wind, and particularly offshore wind, is an application area where the legendary robustness of hydraulic transmissions is desirable, however it has to date been rejected for this application primarily due to its low part-load efficiency. Digital Displacement® Technology was created to address this deficiency; the Efficient Offshore Wind Programme provides an exciting opportunity to scale up this technology to the demanding high power and performance levels of offshore wind.• With its infinitely variable transmission ratio, a Digital Displacement® transmission can be coupled with the varying low-speed wind-turbine rotor to one or more high constant-speed, medium voltage, wound-rotor, synchronous generators. These are the same kind of machines that are used in conventional power stations where they are renowned for their ability to provide network support and for their graceful behaviour during transient network faults.• Digital Displacement® machines have a fully modular construction which offers the opportunity that if necessary almost all components can be swapped out from within the wind turbine nacelle. This is an important advantage in offshore wind-turbines where it is essential to carry out maintenance without costly support from crane barges or jack-up vessels. The high degree of integration between the electronic and mechanical components of Digital Displacement® machines will provide inbuilt performance and condition monitoring. This is particularly important in offshore wind where a very long design life is sought, service intervals are infrequent and technician access may not be possible for weeks at a time.Supply chain development and risk mitigation• In the development of novel technology it is vitally important that the supply chain is engaged at an early stage so that it understands the requirements of the new technology, and is able to deliver the required innovation whilst balancing quality improvement and cost reduction challenges as the project develops and moves into the exploitation stage.• The consortium partners all share the Government's desire to see the localisation of the supply chain and will work through this programme to engage with the industry. Contributing towards a strong local supply chain is one of the key ways in which the UK can attract the wider economic benefits of offshore wind, whilst also helping to enhance its viability.• A further element of the project will investigate ways of reducing the number of interfaces between equipment from different suppliers and to increase standardisation across the value chain, through collaboration between the consortium partners at this early stage.• In the development of new technology it is critical to understand how it can be exploited and brought to the market. A key barrier to the deployment of new technology is its perceived risk in the eyes of the finance and insurance communities. Through early engagement with finance and insurance stakeholders this work package will help to reduce barriers to the deployment of new technology both through better understanding of the associated risks and through the development of risk mitigation strategies that reduce the associated insurance premium.Optimised substructure design• The substructure is affixed to the seabed and provides structural support to the wind turbine tower, as well as providing an interface route to the subsea cable connection. It must be capable of handling the loads imparted by the sea and weather conditions and from the wind turbine. In addition it is subject to the harsh marine environment, presenting material erosion and corrosion challenges during operational life.• The aim of this project is to develop an optimised substructure and transition piece concept for supporting large offshore wind turbines, suitable for low cost bulk manufacture and installation.• The end design will be adaptable to a range of water depths and sea-bed conditions through the utilisation of bespoke design codes that address both engineering and regulatory requirements, for example end of life decommissioning.Transport and installation, cable connection• This project will develop a viable range of concepts for electrical power connection from the wind turbine. This work will include the development of new methodologies for the sea bed installation of cable arrays, cable pull-in techniques, cable protection and connection.• In addition, this project will develop and document a range of competitive solutions for land-based logistics at the port and water-based logistics for transport and installation of Mitsubishi SeaAngel™ class wind turbines. These will be developed to fulfil Round 3 requirements such as medium volume production, representative distance from shore, wave height and water depth.Operation and maintenance, health and safety• To achieve an offshore wind farm design life of over twenty years, a sophisticated approach to operations and maintenance is required. The partners will seek to develop an integrated operations and maintenance strategy by drawing on their combined experience, particularly that derived from the oil and gas sector.• Within the Efficient Offshore Wind Programme, the operations and maintenance philosophy will be developed at an early stage in the design process. In this way it is intended that design decisions can be made in consideration of maintenance requirements to deliver enhanced operational efficiency.• The learning outcomes from the offshore oil and gas industry will be built upon in the development of operations and maintenance procedures. Health and safety risk identification, assessment and mitigation shall be carried out to validate all procedures to ensure that safety of operation and maintenance activity is prioritised.• Optimal component replacement strategies for key components on the offshore wind turbine will be developed with particular consideration to health and safety. These replacement strategies will, where possible be verified at an onshore demonstration site in the UK and if required further refined.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,110061,,,,,,,,"Mitsubishi Hitachi Power Systems Europe, Ltd.","Mitsubishi Hitachi Power Systems Europe, Ltd.",,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:15371013,,

In this research, we propose a design of an innovative sustainable production system by utilizing the 3rd generation biomass in the environment of floating production storage and offloading (FPSO). Existing biomass production systems depend on the solar energy and they cannot continue producing biomass at night. Electricity produced from offshore wind farms also need an efficient way to store the energy through energy storage system (ESS) or deliver it real-time through power grid, both requiring heavy investment of capital. Thus, we design an offshore grid structure harnessing LED lights to supply the necessary light energy, by using the electricity produced from the wind farm, resulting in the maximized production of biomass and efficient use of wind farm energy. The final design integrates the biomass production system enhanced by LED lights with a wind power generation.

Although current technology has been based mainly on land-based wind turbine designs, more turbines are being designed specifically for offshore applications. New standards have been developed to address the unique design environment imposed by loading from both turbulent wind and ocean wave forces acting on the blades, rotor nacelle assembly (RNA), and support structure. The rapid growth of offshore wind applications has presented new challenges to wind turbine engineers.

Fatigue crack propagation behaviour in this test programme is evaluated through fatigue tests on six compact tension test specimens in air and in laboratory simulated seawater under free corrosion condition. Fatigue crack lengths were monitored by back face strain (BFS), DCPD and ACPD. A regression model was derived through the BFS method to express strain values as a function of crack length to width ratio. The effectiveness of BFS method is particularly demonstrated in the simulated marine environment. Within the range of test frequencies, crack growth rates in simulated seawater when compared to the equivalent air test revealed environmental reduction factors of 2 and 4 at lower and higher values of stress intensity factors respectively.

The paper first introduces the formulation of the second order wave radiation-diffraction solver, designed for calculating the wave-floater interaction. Then, the solver of the mooring dynamics, based on a non-linear Finite Element Method (FEM) approach, is presented. Next, the procedure developed for coupling the floater dynamics model with the mooring model is described. Some validation examples of the developed models, and comparisons among different mooring approaches, are presented. Finally, a study of the OC3 floating wind turbine concept is performed to analyze the influence of the mooring model in the dynamics of the platform and the tension in the mooring lines. The work comes to the conclusion that the coupling of a dynamic mooring model along with a second-order wave radiation-diffraction solver can offer realistic predictions of the floating wind turbine performance.

Major contributors to this are the current push for offshore renewable energy sources, which are thought of as environmentally friendly sources of power, as well as the continued demand for petroleum. Human disturbances, including the noise almost ubiquitously associated with human activity, are likely to increase the incidence, magnitude, and duration of adverse effects on marine life, including stress responses. Stress responses have the potential to induce fitness consequences for individuals, which add to more obvious directed takes (e.g., hunting or fishing) to increase the overall population-level impact. To meet the requirements of marine spatial planning and ecosystem-based management, many efforts are ongoing to quantify the cumulative impacts of all human actions on marine species or populations. Meanwhile, regulators face the challenge of managing these accumulating and interacting impacts with limited scientific guidance. We believe there is scientific support for capping the level of impact for (at a minimum) populations in decline or with unknown statuses. This cap on impact can be facilitated through implementation of regular application cycles for project authorization or improved programmatic and aggregated impact assessments that simultaneously consider multiple projects. Cross-company collaborations and a better incorporation of uncertainty into decision making could also help limit, if not reduce, cumulative impacts of multiple human activities. These simple management steps may also form the basis of a rudimentary form of marine spatial planning and could be used in support of future ecosystem-based management efforts.",,,,,,,,,22,0,0,0,18,0,22,,,0888-8892,1523-1739,,,,,,,,,,"George Mason Univ, Dept Environm Sci & Policy, Fairfax, VA 22030 USAAarhus Univ, Dept Biosci, DK-4000 Roskilde, Denmark",,,,2015-04-15,WOS:000351353400004,25439093,

The collision numbers varied from 0 to 125 birds per wind turbine per year. The mean number in 2002 was 24, 35 and 18 birds per wind turbine per year. It is important to know that the mentioned numbers of victims have to be regarded as a strict minimum. The number of collisions on the three studied locations seems to be dependent on the number of passing birds, and in less degree with the size of the wind turbine. Most of the victims were abundant present birds like gulls, ducks and pigeons but we also found rarer species as Grey Heron, Peregrine Falcon, Redshank, Common Tern, Little Tern and Stonechat. The calculated collision chance at rotor height varied between 1 on 12.000 and 1 on 600 passing birds. Most resting or foraging waterfowl species held a distance of 150-300 m from the wind turbines. At one location in the port of Zeebrugge we saw that most gulls and terns, flying between the breeding colonies and feeding areas at sea, crossed the line of wind turbines in a normal way. Therefore, in contrast to the situation with seasonal migration of many species and local migration of waterfowl, during the breeding season the wind turbine line was no barrier jar these birds. However, this study also demonstrates that area's with many local migrations of birds can have a relatively high number of collision victims. The impact on seasonal migrating birds is still unclear, and more research is urgently needed certainly concerning the collision factor.",,,,,,,,,8,1,0,0,8,0,11,,,1379-8863,,,,,,,,,,,"Instituut voor Natuurbehoud, Wetenschappelijke Instelling van de Vlaamse Gemeenschap, Kliniekstraat 25, 1070 Brussel, Belgium",,,,2003-01-01,ZOOREC:ZOOR14103019075,,

Using an energetic modelling approach, we examine the effects of wind farms as barriers to movement on seabirds of differing morphology. Additional costs, expressed in relation to typical daily energetic expenditures, were highest per unit flight for seabirds with high wing loadings, such as cormorants. Taking species-specific differences into account, costs were relatively higher in terns, due to the high daily frequency of foraging flights. For all species, costs of extra flight to avoid a wind farm appear much less than those imposed by low food abundance or adverse weather, although such costs will be additive to these. We conclude that adopting a species-specific approach is essential when assessing the impacts of wind farms on breeding seabird populations, to fully anticipate the effects of avoidance flights.

The zone of influence of water-based drilling fluids as determined by sediment barium concentration was larger (2 to 20 km) than for synthetic-based fluids (200 to 2000 m). The zone of biological effects on benthic community diversity and abundance ranged from 100 to 1000 m for both water and synthetic fluids. Effects include changes in benthic species diversity, abundance and alterations to community structure. Functional changes included a loss of suspension-feeding species and increases in deposit feeders and polychaetes.

However, the performance assessment of offshore wind turbine (OWT) structure is a challenging task due to the combined wind-wave loading and difficulties in reproducing such loading conditions in laboratory. Real-time hybrid simulation (RTHS), combining physical testing and numerical simulation in real-time, offers a new venue to study the structural behavior of OWTs. It overcomes the scaling incompatibilities in OWT scaled model testing by replacing the rotor components with an actuation system, driven by an aerodynamic simulation tool running in real-time. In this study, a RTHS framework for monopile OWTs is proposed. A set of sensitivity analyses is carried out to evaluate the feasibility of this RTHS framework and determine possible tolerances on its design. By simulating different scaling laws and possible error contributors (delays and noises) in the proposed framework, the sensitivity of the OWT responses to these parameters are quantified. An example using a National Renewable Energy Lab (NREL) 5-MW reference OWT system at 1:25 scale is simulated in this study to demonstrate the proposed RTHS framework and sensitivity analyses. Three different scaling laws are considered. The sensitivity results show that the delays in the RTHS framework significantly impact the performance on the response evaluation, higher than the impact of noises.

Offshore wind power generating facilities are becoming more common in the marine environment and alter the characteristics of the fisheries in the surrounding area. Floating wind turbines can act as fish aggregating devices (FAD), thereby increasing the catchability for some species. Many marine recreational fisheries are open access without effort restrictions; therefore, control of total harvest is difficult. Creating a limited entry recreational fishery and excluding commercial fishing from the area surrounding offshore wind turbines may aid in controlling total harvest and may benefit several important stakeholder groups: (1) recreational and commercial fishermen in terms of higher recreational catch rates and potentially higher overall yield, (2) fisheries managers in terms of more precise control of recreational fisheries harvest, and (3) owners of offshore wind power facilities in terms of reduced risk of damage to infrastructure due to fishing activity.

We reproduce the initial PFW-seawater mixing process by means of the UM3 model applied to offshore natural gas platforms currently active in the Northern Adriatic Sea (Mediterranean Sea). Chemical analyses lead to the identification of a chemical tracer (diethylene glycol) which enables us to follow the fate of PFWs into receiving waters. The numerical simulations are realized in different seasonal conditions using both measured oceanographic data and tracer concentrations. The numerical results show the spatial and temporal plume development in different stratification and ambient current conditions. The analytical approach measures concentrations of the diethylene glycol at a maximum sampling distance of 25 m.

We conducted belt transects at various depths in the midwater and around the bottoms of each platform using the research submersible Delta. The bottom depths of these platforms ranged from 49 to 224 m and the midwater beams ranged from 21 to 196 m. We found that there were several distinct differences in the fish assemblages living in the midwater and bottom habitats around all of the platforms. Both midwater and bottom assemblages were dominated by rockfishes. Platform midwaters were dominated by young-of-the-year (YOY) or juveniles up to two years old. Rockfishes larger than about 18 cm total length were rarely seen in the midwater. The fish assemblages around the bottoms of the platforms were dominated by larger individuals, primarily subadults or adults. Density of all fishes was similar between the bottoms and midwater of any given platform. However, the total biomass was much greater on the bottoms, owing to larger fish living there. There was a consistently greater number of species on the bottom than in the midwater of each platform, likely because of a larger variety of habitat types on the bottom. The fish assemblages also differed among platforms. We found significantly higher densities of young-of-the-year rockfishes around platforms north of Pt.

Accessibility is important in determining whether an invasive species can be controlled/eradicated. In the marine environment, depth limits accessibility. We assessed the depth distribution of T. micranthus and T. coccinea on 15 oil/gas platforms using remotely operated vehicles (ROVs). Pooled data indicated that T. micranthus extends to 138 m and probably deeper, while T. coccinea is generally limited to <=78 m. Average depths for T. micranthus were shallower west of the Mississippi River, in its plume, and deeper towards the east. Tubastraea coccinea exhibited a similar geographic depth-distribution pattern, but shallower and subtler. Broad geographic patterns were similar whether using density or percent-cover data for analysis. When considering individual platforms, T. micranthus often reached the bottom and sometimes occurred at depths >=138 m. Tubastraea coccinea were limited to shallow waters on all platforms. Detailed depth distribution patterns varied significantly between analyses using density and percent-cover data, with density probably indicating colonization rates, and percent-cover colony growth. Depth limitation by T. coccinea may be associated with food availability rather than light since it is azooxanthellate.

The mooring chains are connected to the floating foundation below the water level through fairleads and chain-stoppers. The corrosive marine environment and the cyclic loading make the mooring connection prone to corrosion pitting and fatigue crack initiation and propagation from the pits, particularly in the weld zones. In this study, a finite element analysis of the crack growth from corrosion pits has been performed and the results are presented in order to provide an estimate of the extent of damage after the crack is detected. A Python script have been developed which generates the pit profiles based on a non-uniform random distribution of pit dimensions. 3D pits and elliptical cracks are embedded at critical points of weldment on the mooring point and analysed using ABAQUS XFEM. The Walker's model has been applied in the model to examine the effect of realistic R ratios in floating structures on pitting corrosion fatigue crack propagation along with direct cyclic solver.

We review the Danish and European experience of offshore (i.e. marine) windfarms and the effects and impacts which we consider they may have on birds, primarily through barriers to movement, displacement from ideal feeding distributions and collision mortality. We use case studies to demonstrate examples of displacement effects among species such as Red-throated Diver Gavia stellata, Common Scoter Melanitta nigra and Long-tailed Duck Clangula hyemalis but are unable to determine their causes or whether these patterns have population level impacts, assessment of which remains a major challenge. There is accumulating evidence for widespread avoidance of offshore turbines by large-bodied birds at macro-, meso- and micro-scales, but we accept that our knowledge for smaller bird species is less adequate. We conclude that careful siting during the planning phase can avoid a multitude of potential conflicts with avian populations and that despite generally inadequate post-construction monitoring (especially during periods of unusual weather), experience shows low levels of collision rates, especially among long-lived large-bodied bird species considered most at risk. We lack any understanding of the impacts of barrier effects and displacement from favoured feeding areas, but on a single project basis, these impacts to date are considered insignificant at the population level because of the relatively small numbers of birds so affected. Based on experiences from multiple single site studies, it is essential that site specific impact assessments continue to be undertaken to establish the potential effects and impacts of each project development. However, we also urge a more strategic national and international approach to identification, assessment and selection process for sites for potential future development of offshore windfarms. Despite low-level impacts on an individual windfarm basis, cumulative impacts of multiple offshore windfarm development (especially spanning the length of population flyways) have yet to be adequately determined. Developing effective mechanisms to deliver such assessments remains an urgent requirement for the immediate future.",,,,,,,,,14,1,0,0,7,0,16,,,0011-6394,2246-2309,,,,,,,,,,"Aarhus Univ, Dept Biosci, Grenavej 14, DK-8410 Ronde, Denmark",,,,2020-06-25,BCI:BCI202000543452,,

Rigid beam element simulates large cylindrical spar hull and catenary mooring lines are configured by hybrid beam elements. Nonlinear finite element analysis is performed under extreme wave loading at severe deep sea. Morison's equation has been used to calculate the wave forces. Spar responses and mooring line tensions have been evaluated. Though the maximum mooring line tensions are larger at severe sea-state, it becomes regular after one hour of wave loading. The response time histories in surge, heave, pitch and the maximum mooring tension gradually decreases even after attaining steady state. It is because of damping due to heavier and longer mooring lines in coupled spar-mooring system under deep water conditions. The relatively lesser values of response time histories in surge, heave, pitch and the maximum mooring tension under extreme wave loading shows the suitability of a spar platform for deep water harsh and uncertain environmental conditions.",,,,,,,,,13,0,0,0,0,0,14,,,1392-3730,1822-3605,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Malaya, Dept Civil Engn, Kuala Lumpur, MalaysiaIndian Inst Technol Delhi, Dept Appl Mech, Delhi, IndiaUniv Teknol PETRONAS, Dept Civil Engn, Perak, Malaysia",,,,2014-02-05,WOS:000329441900007,,

Expanding coastal infrastructure has led to concerns that increasing artificial habitat will facilitate the spread of non-native species overall and to natural ecosystems. In the Santa Barbara Channel (SBC), California, USA, the non-native bryozoan Watersipora subatra (Ortmann, 1890) has previously been reported only in harbors and on offshore oil platforms. To assess the distribution and potential for spread of W. subatra between coastal infrastructure and natural habitat in the SBC, we surveyed 61 open coastal sites, including natural and artificial habitat, and evaluated the potential dispersal connectivity of W. subatra larvae from harbors and oil platforms to natural reefs using survey results and three-dimensional biophysical modeling. We discovered that this bryozoan has invaded natural reefs in the region. W. subatra was present on approximately 50% of the oil platforms and mainland reef sites, but only 17% of offshore island reef sites. Modeling indicated high potential connectivity from one harbor to the closest reef with W. subatra, 4-5 km distant from the harbor mouth, but dispersal to the more distant sites would likely require intermediate stepping stone sites or anthropogenic transport of spawning adults. Populations on offshore platforms, in contrast, were virtually unconnected to reef sites through ocean circulation. The survey data indicated potential opportunities to manage current and future invasions through the control of larval sources. In particular, manual removal of small isolated populations on reefs at the northern Channel Islands would reduce this source of larvae to uninvaded areas. Consideration of potential connectivity in the placement of mariculture infrastructure along the coast with respect to harbors and other sources of non-native propagules could also help to reduce the potential for stepwise spread of non-natives to natural reef habitat.",,,,,,,,,6,0,0,0,4,0,6,,,1798-6540,1818-5487,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Marine Sci Inst, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USAUniv Calif Santa Barbara, Earth Res Inst, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USABur Ocean Energy Management, Camarillo, CA USA",Bur Ocean Energy Management,,,2020-01-27,WOS:000507576000004,,

As a first indication of the possible effects of this large scale habitat creation on faunal stocks settling on hard substrata, we compared selected taxa of the mobile demersal megafauna (decapods and fish) associated with the foundation of an offshore research platform (a wind-power foundation equivalent) with those of five shipwrecks and different areas of soft bottoms in the southern German Bight, North Sea. When comparing the amount of approximately 5000 planned wind-power foundations (covering 5.1 x 10(6) m(2) of bottom area) with the existing number of at least 1000 shipwrecks (covering 1.2 x 10(6) m(2) of bottom area), it becomes clear that the southern North Sea will provide about 4.3 times more available artificial hard substratum habitats than currently available. With regard to the fauna found on shipwrecks, on soft substrata and on the investigated wind-power foundation, we predict that the amount of added hard substrata will allow the stocks of substrata-limited mobile demersal hard bottom species to increase by 25-165% in that area. The fauna found at the offshore platform foundations is very similar to that at shipwrecks. Megafauna abundances at the foundations, however, are lower compared to those at the highly fractured wrecks and are irregularly scattered over the foundations. The upper regions of the platform construction (5 and 15 m depth) were only sparsely colonized by mobile fauna, the anchorages, however, more densely. The faunal assemblages from the shipwrecks and the foundations, respectively, as well as from the soft bottoms clearly differed from each other. We predict that new wind-power foundations will support the spread of hard bottom fauna into soft bottom areas with low wreck densities. (c) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Although the stock is now showing signs of recovery, management could benefit from a better understanding of regional or even habitat-level differences in stock demographics, as these dynamics ultimately determine overall stock productivity. From 2012 to 2014, we used a fishery-independent vertical line survey to assess Red Snapper relative abundance, size and age structure, and growth parameters at standing oil and gas platforms, decommissioned platform artificial reefs, and natural banks in the western GOM. We captured 1,170 Red Snapper ranging from 275 to 855 mm TL. Vertical line CPUE data showed no differences among the three habitat types. Ages determined for 1,143 individuals ranged from 2 to 30 years; however, most (90%) were younger than age 8. Size and age frequencies revealed that natural banks supported a greater proportion of large and relatively old fish compared to standing platforms or artificial reefs, although this difference was heavily influenced by a single bank that had significantly larger and older Red Snapper than other sites. Mean age was not significantly different among habitat types. Among a suite of growth models fitted to size-at-age data, the logistic model provided the best fit and suggested that fish from artificial reefs reached larger sizes at age than fish from either standing platforms or natural banks. Our study provides the first estimates of habitat-specific growth parameters for Red Snapper in the western GOM, and this information can benefit future stock assessments. This study also highlights the potential benefits of artificial reefs to Red Snapper and indicates that all habitats could contribute similarly to stock productivity on a per-unit-area basis.",,,,,,,,,12,0,0,0,9,0,15,,,0002-8487,1548-8659,,,,,,,,,,"Texas A&M Univ Corpus Christi, Harte Res Inst Gulf Mexico Studies, 6300 Ocean Dr, Corpus Christi, TX 78412 USAFlorida Atlantic Univ, Harbor Branch Oceanog Inst, 5600 US 1 North, Ft Pierce, FL 34946 USATexas Parks & Wildlife Dept, Artificial Reef Program, 4200 Smith Sch Rd, Austin, TX 78744 USA",Texas Parks & Wildlife Dept,,,2018-12-28,WOS:000403848200016,,

This article focuses on the methodologies used to assess both the ecological losses resulting from a development project and the ecological gains generated by an offset measure. The originality of this article is to propose a standardized, operational approach regardless of the development project and the ecosystem impacted that (i) enhances avoidance and reduction efforts and (ii) assesses biodiversity offset needs based on data available in Environmental Impact Assessments (EIAs). The proposed hybrid method combines a multi-criteria analysis of the state of the environment, inspired by the Unified Mitigation Assessment Method (UMAM), and a more accurate assessment at indicator level inspired by Habitat Equivalency Analysis (HEA). The steps of the method, from the selection of biophysical indicators to offset sizing, are described and are then applied to two EIA case studies: one related to a port extension and the other to an offshore wind farm.

This transition increases the need for models able to assess the performance at suitable offshore locations. A simplified model is proposed that computes the dynamic response of FOWT to different met-ocean conditions and calculates the energy production considering the behavior of the structure as well as the downtime of the turbine due to exceeding operating limits. The model is validated against FAST and applied to three offshore sites. The motions response and hub acceleration are largest for West of Barra followed by Gulf of Maine and Costa Brava. The energy generation is also the highest at West of Barra, where a capacity factor of 75% is reached. A comparison between the energy generation of a bottom-fixed and FOWT indicates a difference of less than 1% for all sites. Finally, a sensitivity analysis of hub acceleration and platform pitch limits studies the impact on the capacity factor and downtime. The model can be useful for feasibility or pre-engineering studies and can be of interest for both investigators and developers of offshore wind projects. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

The measured annual IP was 123 +/- 86 gC m(-2) year(-1) (338 +/- 235 mgC m(-2) day(-1)), and its seasonal variations can be described with a left-skewed normal distribution curve. The average seasonal IP values from the highest to the lowest were summer (664 +/- 270 mgC m(-2) day(-1)), autumn (350 +/- 118 mgC m(-2) day(-1)), spring (202 +/- 110 mgC m(-2) day(-1)), and winter (137 +/- 68 mgC m(-2) day(-1)). The lowest IP was during the nutrient-rich winter because it had a short insolation duration, low incident photosynthetic active radiation (PAR) and low light transmission (shallow euphotic zone depth) due to strong vertical mixing. In contrast to the winter, the highest IP was during the nutrient-depleted summer, which had a long insolation duration, high incident PAR and high light transmission (deeper euphotic zone depth). In addition, the heterotrophic nutrients from upwelling in the south might also support the highest IP in summer. As three primary water masses exist in the Taiwan Strait and three of them have different characteristics, different mixing ratios of water masses may cause different chemical and hydrographic conditions, which leads to different levels of Chl a concentrations and primary production. It is worth to mention that offshore wind farm (OWF) construction in the Changyun Rise (CYR) of the Taiwan Strait is on-going. As primary production is the foundation for a marine ecosystem and supports the food web and fish stock, the results of this research can not only be used as the baseline for evaluating the OWF impact on the marine ecosystem but also be used for assessing their influence on fishery resources.",,,,,,,,,22,0,0,0,8,0,22,,,,2296-7745,,,,,,,,,,"Natl Taiwan Ocean Univ, Inst Marine Environm & Ecol, Keelung, TaiwanNatl Taiwan Ocean Univ, Dept Environm Biol & Fisheries Sci, Keelung, TaiwanNatl Taiwan Ocean Univ, Ctr Excellence Oceans, Keelung, Taiwan",,,,2020-02-27,WOS:000513491700001,,

Based on generalized additive modelling analyses, we describe a clear gradient in the decline of porpoise detections after piling, depending on noise level and distance to piling. Declines were found at sound levels exceeding 143 dB re 1 mu Pa(2)s (the sound exposure level exceeded during 5 % of piling time, SEL05) and up to 17 km from piling. When only considering piling events with NMS, the maximum effect distance was 14 km. Compared to 24-48 h before piling, porpoise detections declined more strongly during unmitigated piling events at all distances: at 10-15 km declines were around 50% during piling without NMS, but only 17 % when NMS were applied. Within the vicinity (up to about 2 km) of the construction site, porpoise detections declined several hours before the start of piling and were reduced for about 1-2 d after piling, while at the maximum effect distance, avoidance was only found during the hours of piling. The application of first generation NMS thus reduced the effect range of pile driving and led to a lower decline of porpoise detections over all distances. However, NMS were still under development and did not always work with equal efficiency.

We use qualitative mathematical modeling, which allows to quickly analyze the structure and dynamics of a system without including quantitative data, and therefore to compare alternative system structures based on different understandings of how the system works. By including similar number of system variables in the two subsystems, we balanced the complexity between them. Our analyses show that this complexity is important in order to predict indirect and sometimes counterintuitive effects. We also highlight some conceptually important questions concerning social compensations during developmental projects in general, and wind farms in particular. Our results suggest that the more project holders get involved in various manner in the local socio-ecological system, the more society will benefit as a whole. Increased involvement through e.g. new projects or job-opportunities around the windfarm has the capacity to offset the negative effects of the windfarm on the local community. These benefits are enhanced when there is an overall acceptance and appropriation of the project.

To resolve the attraction-production debate in suddenly altered ecosystems (cf. wind farms), the possible consequences of attraction should be assessed; thereby bearing in mind that ecological traps may arise. In this paper we investigated whether the wind farms in the Belgian part of the North Sea act as ecological traps for pouting and Atlantic cod. Length-at-age, condition and diet composition of fish present at the windmill artificial reefs was compared to local and regional sandy areas.Fish data from the period 2009-2012 were evaluated. Mainly I- and II-group Atlantic cod were present around the WARs; while the 0- and I-group dominated for pouting. For Atlantic cod, no differences in length were observed between sites, indicating that fitness was comparable at the WARs and in sandy areas. No significant differences in condition index were observed for pouting. At the WARs, they were slightly larger and stomach fullness was enhanced compared to the surrounding sandy areas. Also diet differed considerably among the sites. The outcome of the proxies indicate that fitness of pouting was slightly enhanced compared to the surrounding sandy areas. No evidence was obtained supporting the hypothesis that the WARs act as an ecological trap for Atlantic cod and pouting. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

It is known that a diverse and complex ecosystem of attached organisms develops on submerged structures which supports a localized food web that could not exist without them. However, our lack of detailed information makes modelling of system response to decommissioning very tentative. Ideally, we should use the best possible scientific information to reach a consensus as to whether the blanket removal of MMS (excepting derogations) is the most environmentally supportable option. The evidence available to-date shows both benefits and some risk in leaving MMS in place and this needs to be examined without preconception. On the UKCS, MMS as artificial habitats are not considered under the Habitats Directive, irrespective of the value or rarity of the species present.

Fish densities ranged from 0 to 10.5 fish.m(-3) during monthly sampling trips from January 1991 to May 1992. Density and target strength were spatially and temporally variable. Target strengths varied significantly with side of the platform, month, and east and north current vectors. Density varied significantly with platform side, month, east current vector, and depth. Density and target strength did not change over 24 h periods or with water temperature. Fish densities were highest adjacent to the platform and decreased significantly beyond 16 m. Approximately 1990 - 28 100 fish were associated with the platform depending on the month. A total of 19 species were observed at the platform, with Chaetodipterus faber, Caranx fusus, Seriola dumerili, Balistes capriscus, Lutjanus campechanus, and Archosargus probatocephalus constituting 97% of observed fishes. Based on our results, we conclude that the fishes associated with a petroleum platform conform with the open nonequilibrium hypothesis proposed for fishes in coral reef habitats.",,,,,,,,,86,0,1,0,64,3,112,,,0706-652X,1205-7533,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1997-05-01,WOS:A1997XF49600022,,

The uncertainties in the design were then justified by the limited field experience and in the review of the standards and recommendations existing at that time. Fundamentally, an analysis was made of the ratio between useful life and the probability of failure, the wave theories to be used, the hydrodynamics of Morison, Froude-Krylov and diffraction domains, together with the scouring phenomena processes and consequent protection of structural items.Using the knowledge gained during these three years, the research work herein presented covers further reflections such as the nonlinearity in wave mechanics, its effects on orbital seabed velocities, variation in the behaviour of the Keulegan-Carpenter number (KC), impact on scour in the KC-6 equation, the analysis of statistics of forces applied to load combinations in structures at depths in excess of fifty metres, taking giant steps in offshore engineering and leaving behind classical maritime engineering techniques.

In contrast to conventional point-to-point interconnectors, the extension creates a meshed submarine grid (MSG) which includes an interconnector and wind farm collectors to the countries using the same equipment. Denmark East as part of the Nordic system and 50Hertz as part of the synchronous Continental European grid are asynchronous to each other, which makes a frequency transformation necessary. The interconnection will be realised by a high-voltage direct current (HVDC) back-to-back (BtB) converter in voltage source converter technology located at the German end of the interconnector. The BtB and the entire HVAC MSG between Denmark and Germany will be controlled by a so-called master controller for interconnector operation (MIO). The KF CGS will integrate offshore wind power generation, increase the security of supply and enhance integration of regionally produced renewable energy. This study describes the overall infrastructure of the KF CGS and the MIO functions. A model-based evaluation of those shows the behaviour of the HVAC/HVDC MSG in normal operation and in the case of contingencies.",,,,,,,,,10,0,0,0,0,0,10,,,1752-1416,1752-1424,,,,,,,,,,"50Hertz Transmiss GmbH, Heidestr 2, Berlin, GermanyENERGINET, Tonne Kjaersvej 65, Fredericia, DenmarkTech Univ Ilmenau, Power Syst Grp, Gustav Kirchhoffstr 1, Ilmenau, Germany",50Hertz Transmiss GmbHENERGINET,,,2018-10-11,WOS:000445629700009,,
