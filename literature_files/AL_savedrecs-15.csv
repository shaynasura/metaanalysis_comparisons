Such calculations require details of conditions Near the Source of Plume (NSP); (i.e. the plume/jet velocity and radius near the source), which inspired the present work. Determining NSP conditions for gas plumes are far more complex than that for oil plumes due to the substantial density difference between gas and water. To calculate NSP conditions, modeling the early stage of the plume is important. A novel method of modeling the early stage of an underwater gas release is presented here. Major impact of the present work is to define the correct NSP conditions for underwater gas releases, which is not possible with available methods as those techniques are not based on the physics of flow region near the source of the plume/jet. We introduce super Gaussian profiles to model the density and velocity variations of the early stages of plume, coupled with the laws of fluid mechanics to define profile parameters. This new approach, models the velocity profile variation from near uniform, across the section at the release point to Gaussian some distance away. The comparisons show that experimental data agrees well with the computations.",,,,,,,,,7,1,0,0,0,0,8,,,1671-9433,1993-5048,,,,,,,,,,"Clarkson Univ, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Potsdam, NY 13699 USA",,,,2017-11-19,WOS:000414187400008,,

In 1988, a deepened Statfjord producer well (3/9a-N21) detected gas in the underlying Triassic, but testing was not possible at that time. The 3/10b-2 exploration well, drilled in 1992 to the east of the field, tested gas at low rates from a poor quality Triassic reservoir section. In 1995 well 3/9a-N33, a deviated wen, was drilled from the Alwyn platform to evaluate the productivity of the deep Triassic. This well penetrated 770 m of Upper Lunde section, which was tested at 1.3 x 10(6) m 3 per day of gas plus 4400 STB per day of condensate.The Alwyn trap comprises a westerly dipping fault panel structure. Erosion over the crest of the tilted panel and the eastern-facing scarp slope by the Base Cretaceous Unconformity (BCU) truncates the Jurassic section down to the Upper Triassic. Sealing of the Triassic Main accumulation is by uppermost Triassic shales of the overlying Statfjord Formation and by Cretaceous mudrocks onlapping onto the BCU. Hydrocarbon charging of the Triassic Upper Lunde sandstones is from mature Late Jurassic Kimmeridge Clay source rocks that are juxtaposed against the reservoir along parts of the eastern frontal fault of the Alwyn panel.The Upper Lunde (of Carnian to Rhaetian age) is a low net:gross reservoir section up to 800 m thick. The sediments are of semi-arid fluvial, floodplain and lacustrine origins, with the best reservoirs occurring in fluvial channel sandstones. The Late Triassic comprises four informal zones from A (top seal), through B and C to D reservoirs, above the Middle Lunde shale. The Triassic reservoir fluids are gas-condensate in the B and C units with an intraformational seal at the C-D boundary, beneath which lies volatile oil in the D unit.A total of eight further Triassic production wells were added to the Alwyn North Field by the end of 2001, as the development plan for Triassic Main progressed.

As an application of the methodology presented for this purpose, a real case study, the Solway Firth estuary in the UK, has been modelled by means of MIKE21. An idealised model of the estuary has been used to identify the trends in extractable energy and impacts on tidal range for different farm densities and contrasted with a fully detailed model. A spring tide and a coastal flooding scenario have been considered for the detailed model as well as different densities and configurations of the tidal farms. For the densest arrays the extractable energy tends to a limit and the impacts on tidal range become relevant, although they are still lower than the ones resulting from tidal range schemes with similar installed capacities. It has been found that the effects on water levels are not linearly proportional to the increase of the farm density but they seem more closely related to the energy dissipated by the farms. The results of the changes on high and low tide levels over the estuary and time-series at specific locations have been analysed for the detailed models. When comparing between different layouts, changes during low tide levels are slightly higher for the parallel arrays. It can also be concluded that flood risk levels could be potentially reduced in the shoreline whereas some of the intertidal areas and their habitats could disappear as a consequence of significant water level rise at low tides.

These mangroves constitute both natural stands (e.g. Kadolkele) and woodlots planted, protected and managed by fishermen (e.g. Wedikanda) to extract twigs and branches to construct brush parks, a traditional method of fishing in this estuary. Both types of mangrove stands support high species richness and structural diversity, indicating planted mangrove areas have reached a semi-natural state. Allometric relationships were used to calculate biomass increment. Differences in litterfall, above and below ground biomass increment and net primary productivity (NPP) of the two types of mangrove areas were statistically insignificant, thus indicating that they are structurally and functionally comparable. Average rate of mangrove litterfall in Negombo estuary was 802 +/- 25g m(-2)y(-1). The average above ground biomass increment was 1213 +/- 95 gm(-2)y(-1) and below ground increment was 267 +/- 18 gm(-2)y(-1), thus the average NPP of these mangroves was 2282 +/- 125 g m(-2)y(-1). NPP showed a decreasing trend from water towards land, in line with plant density and leaf area index. A statistically significant relationship was found between vegetation structure (represented by complexity index), NPP and rate of organic carbon accumulation in mangroves. Potential carbon accumulation capacity of mangroves of Negombo estuary was estimated to be approximately 12 t ha(-1)y(-1), which is equivalent to the amount of carbon emitted as CO2 through combustion of 19,357 L of diesel or 22,212 L of gasoline in motor vehicles. Potential atmospheric carbon removal capacity of Negombo estuarine mangroves (350 ha in extent) therefore was estimated to be 4143 t y(-1), which is equivalent to removal of CO2 emitted through combustion of 6,779,000 L of diesel or 7,779,000 L of gasoline within a year.

This trend is now spreading throughout the world.The LNG bunkering methods currently in use are truck-to-ship (TTS), ship-to-ship (STS) and pipeline-to-ship (PTS). This paper describes a study conducted to identify potential risks associated with LNG bunkering with particular emphasis on the fuel-supplying side. A series of parametric analyses were also carried out to identify the sensitivity to some parameters with the aid of a purpose-built computer program, Integrated Quantitative Risk Assessment (IQRA). Through the parametric analyses, general relationships between the risk and various parameters could be established from which the importance of the selected parameters might be evaluated.This paper also proposes a new approach of establishing realistic safety exclusion zones in LNG bunkering process. Research findings demonstrate that the implied hypothesis that the current practice of the probabilistic risk assessment focused on the population-independent analysis only is somewhat inadequate when applied to determining the safety exclusion zones as showing that the extent of safety exclusion zones tends to be set up unpractically wide. Instead, the proposed approach designed with the combination of population-dependant and independent analyses is proven to be useful in determining the zones more realistically. It may form a basis on which more useful safety-related standards and regulations on LNG bunkering can be built.",,,,,,,,,25,0,0,0,0,0,25,,,0029-8018,,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Strathclyde, Dept Naval Architecture Ocean & Marine Engn, 100 Montrose St, Glasgow G4 0LZ, Lanark, ScotlandKorean Resister Shipping, 36 Myeongji Ocean City 9 Ro, Busan, South KoreaZhejiang Univ, 1 Zheda Rd, Zhoushan 316021, Zhejiang, Peoples R China",Korean Resister Shipping,,,2018-12-28,WOS:000428489800011,,

This argument assumes that insect herbivory in the understorey is sufficiently intense as to select for storage; however, understoreys might be less attractive to insect herbivores than canopy gaps, because of low resource availability and - at temperate latitudes - low temperatures. Although empirical studies show that shade-tolerant species in tropical forests do allocate more photosynthate to storage than their light-demanding associates, the same pattern has not been consistently observed in temperate forests. Does this reflect a latitudinal trend in the relative activity of insect herbivory in gap versus understorey environments? To date there has been no global review of the effect of light environment on insect herbivory in forests. We postulated that if temperature is the primary factor limiting insect herbivory, the effect of gaps on rates of insect herbivory should be more evident in temperate than in tropical forests; due to low growing season temperatures in the oceanic temperate forests of the Southern Hemisphere, the effect of gaps on insect herbivory rates should in turn be stronger there than in the more continental temperate climates of the Northern Hemisphere. We examined global patterns of insect herbivory in gaps versus understories through meta-analysis of 87 conspecific comparisons of leaf damage in contrasting light environments. Overall, insect herbivory in gaps was significantly higher than in the understorey; insect herbivory was 50% higher in gaps than in understoreys of tropical forests but did not differ significantly between gaps and understories in temperate forests of either hemisphere. Results are consistent with the idea that low resource availability - and not temperature - limits insect herbivore activity in forest understoreys, especially in the tropics, and suggest the selective influence of insect herbivory on late-successional tree species may have been over-estimated.",,,,,,,,,12,0,0,0,10,0,12,,,0030-1299,1600-0706,,,,,,,,,,"CIEP, Moraleda 16, Coyhaique, ChileUniv Waikato, Environm Res Inst, Hamilton, New Zealand",CIEP,,,2018-04-16,WOS:000429006200001,,

To accurately capture the recoil dynamics of a deep-water riser in an emergency disconnect scenario, researchers typically focus on modelling the influential subsystems (e.g., the tensioner, the mud discharge and seawater refilling process) which can be solved in the preprocessing, and then the determined parameters are transmitted into an existing global riser analysis software. Distinctively, the current study devotes efforts into the coupling effects resulting from that the suspended riser reacts the platform heave motion via the tensioner system in the course of recoil and the discharging fluid column follows the oscillation of the riser in the mud discharge process. Four simulation models are established based on lumped mass method employing different formulas for the top boundary condition of the riser and the discharging flow acceleration. It demonstrates that the coupling effects discussed above can significantly affect the recoil behavior during the transition phase from initial disconnect to the final hang-off state.

Published global catalogues show that diffuse seismicity of moderate magnitude (events up to 5.6 mb) can be associated with the Northern flank of the Galicia Margin, with a roughly E-W distribution. However, event locations in this area are poorly constrained due to the inappropriate geometry of permanent seismic networks. We collected and analyzed new data from a dense deployment of 10 OB S around the wreck site and from a network of 12 land stations at the NW corner of Iberia. During a 7 months operation period, the land network permitted location of 120 events with magnitudes ranging from 1.6 to 4.8, more than 30% of which were not reported by the Spanish permanent array, confirming the existence of a moderate seismicity in this area. Five new focal solutions have been obtained for events on-land, providing additional information about the active faults in the region. The OBS network ran for I month and allowed the location of three earthquakes of magnitude <= 2.5 near the sinking site. Four more events have been identified, with just a rough determination of their epicenters based on polarization of the P-wave arrivals. Besides these earthquakes, the OBS data recorded numerous seismic events of different types. They include: i) groups of very short and regularly spaced pulses that can be explained as acoustic calls generated by finback whales; ii) a large number of short-duration seismic events (2-3 s long) identified only at individual OBS; iii) local intense monochromatic signals lasting for up to 4 h that can be described as harmonic tremors. These last two types of seismic events might be related to hydrothermal activity within the uppermost sediments and deserve additional studies to appropriately establish the seismic hazard of this area.

Oil giants such as Amoco and Exxon/Mobil have each installed an electrical power capacity of 3 GW, and Texaco operates currently 2.5 GW with the next 5 GW under construction.The trend favours implementation of the zero-emission stack downward and grave-in-the-cradle concepts, in situations where oil wells, refinery and power plant form one complex. Hereby the power plant consumes residual oil, petroleum coke or coal, light fractions are sold as transport fuel, with simultaneous power generation together with congeneration of heat for district heating and liquid carbon dioxide (CO2). The latter is injected into depleted or obsolete oil wells to increase oil extraction from the usual 40% to about 80% of OOIP. CO2 dissolves into the viscous oil forming a supercritical fluid which is easily extracted. Subsequently CO2 is separated from the crude oil and is reinjected for permanent subterranean disposal, therefore avoiding emission to the atmosphere. The only stack of the power plant is thus directed downwards, conducting liquid CO2.Enhancement of oil recovery from productive wells by CO2 injection is widely used in the U.S.A., but not in Europe. At present only Norsk Hydro is involved in such a project. Norway is pioneering in the practice of massive CO2 injection (Utsira, about 4 years, 1 million tCO(2) annual sequestering at a depth of 1 km). The setting in Europe is no worse than in the USA with an extractable oil amount of about 300 million t, with perhaps more offshore. The great challenge for the power industry is the replacement of about 100 GW decommissioned nuclear power plants, resulting from the anticipated fall-off in the period 2010-2020. The only visible option is fuel-fired zero-emission power plant.This paper is aimed at describing one of the best zero-emission power plant cycles, called quasicombined, comprised of an air separation unit, combustion of gasified fuel in a mixture of oxygen and recirculated CO2, medium and high pressure turbines on CO2, a recuperator and a multistaged intercooled CO2 compressor. Cycle node points and graphs of efficiency versus turbine inlet temperatures are included. Some recommended regimes for CO2 injection, including a delay before extraction for better oil dissolution are also described.Considering an attainable efficiency of 50% and contemporary prices of gasoline and electricity, the broad economics of the convergence on zero-emission basis look encouraging, especially for Europe with strict environment regulations, dense population, many depleted wells and great power demand.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,0342-5622,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2000-06-01,WOS:000088317000001,,

Failure mechanisms, i.e., sequences of events which may lead to failure, are nowadays more likely to happen. Therefore, it is important to develop reliable numerical tools that can be used in the design stages or during service-life to assess the structural integrity of pipes under specific operational conditions.This work presents a methodology to develop simple finite element models capable to reproduce the behavior of structural layers of flexible pipes under hydrostatic pressure up to the onset of collapse. The models use beam elements and include contact between layers, nonlinear kinematics and material behavior. Different configurations were analyzed: carcass-only, and carcass plus pressure armor with dry and wet annular. The dependability of the numerical models is assessed in light of experimental tests on flexible pipes with 4 and 8 inch nominal internal diameters. Relevant geometric parameters and material properties of each specimen were measured and subsequently used in the models to reproduce the physical experiments. The metallic inner carcass and pressure armor layer manufacturing processes cause a high degree of stress-induced material anisotropy. Due to the inherent difficulty to determine the non-homogeneous elastic-plastic material behavior of the wires' cross-sections, a novel alternative method was used to estimate their average stress-strain curves up to moderate strains (2%).Good correlation was obtained between experimental and numerical results.

One of the major issues facing many developing countries is the need for better utilization and protection of their natural resources. In the world's industrialized nations remote sensing and GIS technologies are used in many applications that include, but not limited to, natural resources management and protection, environmental monitoring, agriculture, geology, hydrology and water resource management, disaster management, urban planning, monitoring spread of infectious diseases, and marine studies. These nations have made heavy investment in building and deploying space assets to monitor earth resources. However, very little has been done to promote the leveraging of this investment in technology by developing countries. There are far reaching benefits to these emerging economies through the exploitation of this technology. Not only could they be forewarned about natural disasters to minimize loss of life and property, but, they could use it to enhance their country's critical food supply and water resources and even develop an effective natural resource exploitation (e.g. oil and gas) capability. These capabilities will allow developing countries to become more self-reliant and less dependent on other countries and international aid agencies.Remote sensing and GIS technologies can be transferred to developing countries for implementation of large-scale and national GIS systems. Such systems will integrate advanced computing platforms, high-speed networks, high performance image processing and GIS products, sophisticated data capturing devices, state-of-the-art product generation equipment, and robust archival and dissemination elements. A variety of remotely sensed data (multi-temporal, spatial, and spectral resolution), geospatial, and in-situ data will be integrated to generate value-added products, extract thematic/spatial features, and derive information to support operational governmental applications and decision-makingWhen fully implemented, a national GIs system will revolutionize public and private sector practices through modernization of records and computerization of services. This technological revolution will significantly contribute to the continual economic and technological advancement. Through such a system, government officials will be provided with reliable, accurate, current data and automated tools to make informed decisions, formulate sound polices, and implement sensible short-term and long-term plans to properly allocate and manage resources. As a result, citizens of developing countries will realize higher standards of living and a wide-range of socioeconomic benefits.",,,,,IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium (IGARSS 2002)/24th Canadian Symposium on Remote SensingIEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium (IGARSS 2002)/24th Canadian Symposium on Remote Sensing,"JUN 24-28, 2002JUN 24-28, 2002","IEEE; IEEE, Geosci & Remote Sensing Soc; Canadian Remote Sensing Soc; Univ Waterloo; Natl Resouces Candad; Canadian Space Agcy; Environm Canada; Natl Aeronaut & Space Adm; Natl Ocean & Atmospher Adm; Off Naval Res; Natl Space Dev Agcy Japan; Natl Polar-Orbit Environm Satellite Syst; Ball Aerosp & Technol; Int Union Radio SciIEEE; IEEE, Geosci & Remote Sensing Soc; Canadian Remote Sensing Soc; Univ Waterloo; Natl Resouces Candad; Canadian Space Agcy; Environm Canada; Natl Aeronaut & Space Adm; Natl Ocean & Atmospher Adm; Off Naval Res; Natl Space Dev Agcy Japan; Natl Polar-Orbit Environm Satellite Syst; Ball Aerosp & Technol; Int Union Radio Sci","TORONTO, CANADATORONTO, CANADA",5,0,0,0,0,0,6,,,,,0-7803-7536-X,,,,,,,,,,,,,2002-01-01,WOS:000179116800745,,

The nitrogen single expander process is simple owing to its single-phase operation, and it employs high occupational safety and environment-friendly refrigerants. However, this process has low energy efficiency. Recent advancements in expansion devices show the possibility of handling two-phase refrigerant flow in an economical and simple manner. Accordingly, this paper proposes two-phase expansion using an innovative binary mixed refrigerant (MR) composed of ethane and nitrogen (C2N). Furthermore, a propane-precooling refrigeration cycle is also implemented and evaluated to analyze greater potential benefits of ethane-nitrogen refrigerant with two-phase expansion. To assess the technical and commercial feasibility of the proposed liquefaction process, energy, exergy, and economic (3E) analysis is performed. Using the C2N two-phase expander LNG process, 47.83% energy can be saved with 55.25% exergy destruction minimization and 24.12% total annualized costs (TAC) savings as compared to previously published nitrogen single expander process. Whereas, the C-3-precooled C2N process gives higher energy savings i.e., 52.45% but low TAC savings i.e., 1.6% as compared to nitrogen single expander LNG process. Considering TAC savings, the C2N process (without propane-precooling) can be a promising candidate for offshore applications. (c) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

It provides a hindsight evaluation of the measures taken to achieve the authority's goal of only accepting essential development which would not put at risk the traditional economic activities and social patterns of the Shetland community.

The conventional AHC technology, however, focuses only on compensating the vessel motion. The cable compliance, which is significant in deep water handling, is usually neglected. As a result, it is difficult to achieve the desired motion control accuracy, in particular as the disturbance is injected other than ship heaving. In this paper, a new type of AHC scheme, Actively Damped Heave Compensation (ADHC) control, is presented. The novelty of this work is, in addition to the vessel motion, the cable dynamics has also been taken into account and compensated.

The analysis of variance for nutrient concentration, nutrient storage, or nutrients extracted in both the litter layer and top 10 cm of mineral soil showed no significant differences among sites or seasons for any nutrient; only differences among forest ages will be discussed. Concentrations of N, P, Mg, Mn, and Cu in forest litter did not differ by forest age, but concentrations of K, Ca, and B were significantly higher in old-growth forest litter than in the litter of second- or young-growth forests. In mineral soil, the concentrations of all nutrients were statistically equal for all forest ages.

To meet such huge energy demands a complicated and vast network of offshore and onshore production and distribution pipelines is necessary. Pipelines connect areas that are relatively rich in resources with areas that are demand-hungry but poor in resources. They play a central role in providing to the energy needs of businesses and public, forming the veins and arteries of the Oil and Gas industry. These pipelines are susceptible to damage, both internal and external based on the type of product in the pipeline and the environment in the vicinity of the pipeline i.e. offshore or onshore. The damage to the pipeline needs to be identified and the significance of the damage clearly defined. The inline inspection (ILI) tools help to identify the damage and record the extent and type of damage. Inability to prioritize the damaged areas and carry out necessary intervention to at least curtail the damage may occasionally lead to calamitous consequences. One such example is of a 30-inch Liquid pipeline failure that occurred in Michigan on July 25, 2010. The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) reported that the corrosion fatigue cracks that grew and coalesced from corrosion defects resulted in the rupture and prolonged release from the 30-inch oil pipeline [2].

The basic approach is to focus on the incremental risk that would occur if the PT were run from a DP vessel as opposed to a fixed structure. The analysis is structured around two basic groups of risk: those specifically associated with DP vessel disconnection decisions and activities (all of which are seasonal), and those occurring during normal operation of the DP vessel. In the case of disconnection caused by hazards such as severe weather ice, equipment or reference system malfunction, or human/operating error, a large variety of event sequences is assumed, each resulting in different consequences and risks. These are formulated for each analysis outcome in terms of loss of life, release of chemicals into the environment, and damage and loss of assets and equipment, as well as overall failure cost. It is shown that the QRA provides a very useful basis for optimal decision making with respect to the feasibility, the planning, and the risk/benefit of deep-water production testing from a DP vessel.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,0892-7219,,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Calgary, Dept Civil Engn, Calgary, AB T2N 1N4, CanadaEnCana Corp, Calgary, AB T2P 2S5, CanadaBlade Energy Partners, Frisco, TX 75034 USA",EnCana CorpBlade Energy Partners,,,2005-02-01,WOS:000228628600007,,

Our tests have shown that the sensor can withstand exposure to increased total pressures (up to 350 psi) and provide a stable signal response proportional to dissolved CO2 concentrations in an aqueous solution. This is the first implementation of a distributed optical sensor, which is sensitive to dissolved CO2 concentration or partial pressure of CO2 and also exhibits feasibility to commercially produce lengths relevant for actual reservoir monitoring. In addition, first promising results from high-pressure experiments suggest that the sensor has potential for eventually being used in long-term installations for measuring dissolved CO2 concentrations at different reservoir depths. With regard to carbon sequestration, these first high-pressure experiments represent a first step in the development of a new fibre optic sensor system that can eventually be employed to continuously monitor the reservoir and overlying rock layers for CO2 leaks, quantify the extend of the potential leak and help to take informed decisions regarding remediation and further leak-containment measures.

In order to improve the separation effect, the influence of swing on removing CO2 from offshore natural gas by the adsorption was studied systematically by experiment and simulation. Firstly, the adsorption experiment was carried out under the quiescent condition, single direction swing with a frequency of 0.12 Hz, bidirectional coupling swing with a frequency of 0.12 Hz and quiescent condition with a tilting angle of 20 degrees by the swing experiment platform. The results indicated that the swing of the adsorber can reduce the adsorption purification effect, and which is not caused by the decrease of the adsorbent performance. Then, the adsorption purification model was established and the validity of the model was verified by experiments. Finally, the effects of tilting angle and L/D ratio of the porous zone, inlet flow rate of the mixture gas, particle diameter of adsorbent, and gas inlet distribution of the adsorber on adsorption purification under the quiescent and swing conditions were studied in detail. The results showed that decreasing the tilting angle of the porous zone and inlet flow rate of the mixture gas, or increasing the L/D ratio of the porous zone, the particle diameter of the adsorbent and the inlet amounts of the adsorber can reduce the adverse effect of swing on purification of natural gas. It is of great significance to improve the effect of adsorption purification of natural gas under swing condition by changing the adsorption conditions and structure of the adsorber.

Alumina-functionalized sorbents were prepared by incipient wetness impregnation achieving K2CO3 loadings from 3.6 to 14.1% wt. Carbonation tests were performed in a fixed-bed column at temperatures between 60 and 105 degrees C, as those typically occurring at the outlet of a scrubber and/or a waste heat recovery unit, with a model diesel engine exhaust (5% vol. CO2, 5% vol. H2O, balance N-2). According to the carbonate loading, the sorbents may reach conversion degrees of carbonate up to 90% and overall capture capacity up to 0.66 mol kg(-1) sorbent. Experimental data showed higher conversion degree and capture capacity compared with unsupported K2CO3, which is affected by significant intraparticle diffusion limitations. Steam regeneration tests performed in a fixed-bed column on the sorbent with 3.6% wt K2CO3 loading revealed that a temperature of 120 degrees C assures almost complete recovery of captured CO2 while preserving the sorbent carbonation degree for 10 consecutive carbonation/regeneration cycles. The preliminary design of a temperature swing carbonation/regeneration unit for on-board ship installation was performed for the reference case study of a passenger ship equipped with a 4.35 MW marine engine fueled with marine gas oil and with a commercial seawater scrubber for SO2 removal.

However, an impact of this variability on deep ocean properties has not been detected. Here we use a data-constrained ocean circulation model and observed long-term mean distributions of dissolved oxygen and the nutrient phosphate to show that there is a threefold variation across latitudes in the amount of dissolved oxygen consumed per unit of phosphate released during organic matter respiration. This pattern of remineralization ratios is shown to significantly modify the extent and distribution of low-oxygen water masses in the interior ocean. We also find that ocean biomes with distinct light and nutrient availability are characterized by different regional stoichiometries.

In this study, a novel advanced oxidation process based on plasma operated in the gas-liquid interface was used to rapidly decompose PAM, and multiple methods including viscometry, flow field-flow fractionation multi-angle light scattering, UV-visible spectroscopy, and attenuated total reflectance Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy were used to characterize the changes of PAM. Under a discharge voltage of 25 kV and pH 7.0, the PAM concentration decreased from 100 to 0 mg/L within 20 min and the total organic carbon (TOC) decreased from 49.57 to 1.23 mg/L within 240 min, following zero-order reaction kinetics. Even in the presence of background TOC as high as 152.2 mg/L, complete removal of PAM (100 mg/L) was also achieved within 30 min. The biodegradability of PAM improved following plasma treatment for 120 min. Active species (such as O-3 and H2O2) were produced in the plasma. Hydroxyl radical was demonstrated to play an important role in the degradation of PAM due to the inhibitory effect observed after the addition of an center dot OH scavenger, Na2CO3. Meanwhile, the release of ammonia and nitrate nitrogen confirmed the cleavage of the acylamino group. The results of this study demonstrated that plasma, with its high efficiency and chemical-free features, is a promising technology for the rapid removal of PAM.

In addition several chemical companies often store and transport large quantities of CO2 and this may also represent a hazard. There is a need to model potential loss of containment scenarios for risk assessment and design purposes for such installations. It is observed that several models used in quantitative risk analyses and hazard assessment studies are not able to take into account modelling of the thermodynamics of CO2 in case of accidental releases from dense or supercritical conditions. Statoil together with DNV therefore initiated a project to further improve the Phast code for modelling of CO2 releases. The work and methodology derived in this project have mainly been developed by Det Norske Veritas (DNV), but with significant co-operation and input by Statoil.The consequence modelling package Phast examines the progress of a potential incident from the initial release to the far-field dispersion including the modelling of rainout and subsequent vaporisation. The original Phast 6.54 models allow the released chemical to occur only in the vapour and liquid phases. The new Phast 6.6 models were extended to also allow for the occurrence of fluid to solid transition in case of CO2 releases. This applies both for the post-expansion state in the discharge model, as well as for the thermodynamic calculations by the dispersion model. Here it is assumed that no solid deposition occurs on the ground. The current paper documents work regarding modelling by Phast 6.6 of discharge and atmospheric dispersion of carbon dioxide, including a detailed sensitivity analysis for a wide range of scenarios (base cases) including high-pressure cold releases (liquid storage) and high-pressure supercritical releases (vapour storage) from vessels, short pipes or long pipes. The objectives of this work were to examine the effect of input parameters on key output data, to ensure robustness of the models, and to identify further model improvements where deemed to be necessary.

In this study, we wanted to determine whether soil microbial communities were significantly different in early successional mitigated wetlands (< 10 years) (ES) compared to late successional bottomland hardwood forest wetlands (LS) due to differences in soil properties, such as carbon quality and storage and water-holding capacity. Carbon storage in litter and soil was 1.5 times greater in LS wetlands than ES wetlands. Soil water-holding capacity was significantly greater in LS wetlands and was related to soil organic C content (r(2)=0.87, p-value=0.0007). Gravimetric water content was a moderately strong predictor of microbial respiration (r(2)=0.55-0.61, p-value=0.001-0.0004) and microbial biomass (r(2)=0.70, p-value=0.0019). Anaerobic microbial groups were enriched in soils from LS wetlands in both the dry and wet seasons, which suggested that LS soils were wetter for longer periods of the year than ES soils. The capacity of these wetlands to support anaerobic microbial processes depends on soil water retention characteristics, which were dictated by organic matter content.

Stress associated to reactive oxygen species formation was assessed on digestive glands and gills as the enzymatic antioxidant activity of catalase (CAT), superoxide dismutase (SOD), and glutathione S-transferase (GST) and as the concentrations of lipidsoluble (alpha-tocopherol and beta-carotene) and the water-soluble antioxidants (reduced and oxidized glutathione (GSH and GSSG)). Gills and digestive glands of those animals located in the inner areas of Algeciras Bay showed higher CAT activity values than those located in the outer areas. As a general pattern, we observed higher antioxidant activities and concentrations in digestive glands that in gills, suggesting the possibility that pollutants are mainly being incorporated by limpets through the food.

To manage the risk, operators commonly use aids to support decision making in the establishment of a maintenance and inspection strategy. Risk-based inspection (RBI) analysis is widely used in the offshore industry as a means to justify the inspection strategy adopted.The RBI analysis is a decision-making technique that enables asset managers to identify the risk related to failure of their most critical systems and components, with an effect on safety, environmental, and business-related issues. Risk is a measure of possible loss or injury, and is expressed as the combination of the incident probability and its consequences. A component may have several associated risk levels, depending on the different consequences of failure and the different probabilities of those failures occurring.Microbiologically influenced corrosion (MIC) is a degradation mechanism that has received increased attention from corrosion engineers and asset operators in the past decades. In this paper, the most recent models that have been developed to assess the impact of MIC on asset integrity will be presented and discussed.From a risk perspective, the current models do not satisfactorily assess MIC, and the models lack a proper view of the MIC threat. Therefore, a review of known parameters that affect MIC is presented. The mapping and identification of parameters are based on the review of past models and an extensive up-to-date literature study.The parameters are discussed and subsequently combined in a novel procedure that allows the assessment of MIC in an RBI analysis. The procedure is subdivided into one screening step and a detailed assessment, which fits the recommended approach to assess risk in an RBI analysis. To illustrate the practical application of the developed procedure, a field case is presented.",,,,,,,,,8,0,0,0,0,0,8,,,1930-1855,1930-1863,,,,,,,,,,"VIA Univ Coll, Ctr Appl Res & Dev Bldg Energy & Environm, Horsens, DenmarkOst Riv AS, Slemmestad, Buskerud, NorwayDNV GL, Oslo, Norway",VIA Univ CollOst Riv AS,,,2018-06-28,WOS:000435210400012,,

In this article, we present a very brief analysis of our continuous three-month (January-March 2005) monitoring and recording of aftershock data following the main earthquake to show how this endeavor reduced public panic and constituted an important ingredient to a disaster management program for the Andaman-Nicobar region. Monitoring was conducted using six short-period three-component temporary digital seismograph stations set up in different parts of the Andaman and Nicobar islands. Our findings demonstrate that 1) there was no aftershock gap zone as recorded by the far-distant seismographic network, hence negating the possibility of immediate strong quakes in the Andaman and Nicobar islands; 2) there was no strong shaking at full moon (26 January 2005) due to tidal stresses, although the rate of aftershock activity increased by about 31% from the events of the preceding day; 3) there is a north-south trending 850 x 350-km(2) rupture area beneath the Andaman and Nicobar islands; and 4) eruptions of mud at the Baratang volcanic zone and lavas at the Barren volcanic zone occurred because of strong shaking due to the mainshock and a series of afiershock clusters within 100 km of the individual volcanic zones. These eruptions may continue for a couple of years, until the aftershock sequence ceases. We show that this new dataset from the local seismographic network constituted an important factor in reassuring the coastal people and islanders about imminent dangers from future earthquakes and tsunamis, and we propose geochemical tests of the erupted mud samples from the Baratang volcanic zone, with geophysical exploration followed by drilling, to ascertain the presence of oil and gas reserves and the phenomenon of gas seepage under the land and sea in the Middle Andaman region of India.",,,,,,,,,18,0,0,0,2,0,21,,,0895-0695,1938-2057,,,,,,,,,,"Geol Survey India, Cent Geophys Div, Kolkata 700016, W Bengal, IndiaGeol Survey India, Div Geophys, Eastern Reg Off, Tashkent 700095, Uzbekistan",Geol Survey India,,,2007-11-01,WOS:000251022400004,,

Fines migration, sand production, and additional damages caused by precipitation are some of the common concerns related to sandstone treatments. Furthermore, the complexities of sandstone formations require a mixture of acids and loadings of several additives. The environmentally friendly chelating agent glutamic acid N,N-diacetic acid (GLDA) was used successfully to stimulate deep gas wells in carbonate reservoirs. It was tested extensively in the laboratory to stimulate sandstone cores with various mineralogies. Significant permeability improvements were reported in previous papers over a wide range of conditions. In this paper, the result of the first field application is evaluated with a fluid based on this chelating agent to acidize an offshore, sour oil well in a sandstone reservoir.The field treatment included pumping a preflush of xylene to remove oil residues and any possible asphaltene deposited in the wellbore region, followed by the main stage that contained 25 wt% GLDA, a corrosion inhibitor, and a water-wetting surfactant. The treatment fluids were displaced into the formation by pumping diesel. The treatment fluids were allowed to soak for 6 hours, then the well was put into production, and samples of flowback fluids were collected. The concentrations of key cations were determined using inductively coupled plasma, and the chelant concentration was measured using a titration method with ferric chloride solutions.Corrosion tests conducted on low-carbon-steel tubulars indicated that this chelant has low corrosion rates under bottomhole conditions. No corrosion-inhibitor intensifier was needed. The treatment was applied in the field without encountering any operational problems. A significant gain in oil production was achieved without causing sand production, or fines migration. Analysis of flowback samples confirmed the ability of the chelating-agent solution to dissolve various types of carbonates, oxides, and sulphides, while keeping the dissolved species in solution without causing unwanted precipitation. Unlike previous treatments conducted on this well, where 15 wt% hydrochloric acid (HCl) or 13.5 wt%/1.5 wt% HCl/hydrofluoric acid (HF) acids were used, the concentrations of iron and manganese in the flowback samples were negligible, confirming the low corrosion rates of well tubulars when using GLDA solutions.",,,,,,,,,9,0,0,0,0,0,9,,,0021-9487,2156-4663,,,,,,,,,,"Texas A&M Univ, Petr Engn, College Stn, TX 77843 USAAkzoNobel, Deventer, NetherlandsAkzoNobel, Oil & Gas, Deventer, NetherlandsAkzoNobel, Oilfield Chem, Deventer, Netherlands",AkzoNobelAkzoNobelAkzoNobel,,,2015-09-01,WOS:000364556900005,,

However, the spatial patterns and major controls of soil C concentration and C density in coastal wetlands remain poorly known. We measured soil total C concentration up to one meter depth and assessed environmental and biological factors influencing soil C input and decomposition processes across various geomorphologic settings and mangrove forest types at Dongzhai Bay, China. Structural equation modeling (SEM) was used to determine the causal pathways of influencing factors on soil C concentration. We found that the variation pattern of soil C concentration across geomorphologic settings and forest types was mirrored by soil properties. From 68 to 94% (varying with soil depth) variations of soil C concentration were explained by the inter-related influencing factors included in SEM. In the upper 60 cm soil layers, soil moisture was the most important factor affecting soil C concentration. In the 60-100 cm subsoil zone, the proportion of finer soil particles was the primary control of soil C concentration variation. In contrast, aboveground biomass and nearness of sampling site to the open water, which affect autochthonous and allochthonous C inputs, had relatively weak effects on soil C concentration compared to soil properties, which affect C decomposition. Soil C concentration was a good predictor of soil C density at all soil depths. The results suggest that top-and subsoil C concentrations in mangroves are subjected to different environmental controls, but taken together, mangrove soil C storage may be primarily controlled by soil property-mediated C decomposition rate. Subsoil C deserves more attention since it may respond differently to environmental changes than the better-known topsoil C.

The objective of this proposal is to acquire a Field Spectroscopy Environmental Analysis System to enable collection of highly perishable data on the Deepwater Horizon oil spill. More specifically, the instrument will be used to take in-situ measurements of the spectral response of oil spill and vegetation under stress between 350 nm and 2500 nm. The need for collecting these field samples is urgent due to the rapid evolution of spatial distribution and physical-chemical composition of leaked oil as it begins interacting with the environment and oil collection efforts. The transient and dynamic nature of such a large-scale disaster calls for both immediate and continuous efforts in data collection, benchmarking, and quantitative analysis for monitoring, assessment, and management of the impact of this and future spills. The new instrument will enable the team to take time-sensitive, in-situ measurements of solar reflectance of oil spill in various physical forms (e.g. sheen, patch, tar balls) at various sites (e.g. deep water, shallow water, marshes, and beaches) while recording their geospatial locations. In conjunction with hyperspectral images acquired by satellites and/or aircraft, the team will be able to pursue potentially transformative research in 1) seeking a spectral-spatial solution for achieving more accurate oil distribution mapping in open water; 2) estimating oil slick thickness based on its spectrum and water conditions; 3) assessing the quantity of tar balls onshore using spectral un-mixing to support clean-up activities; and 4) detecting the presence of oil in complex, environmentally sensitive ecosystems. Environmental toxicologists on the team will use the instrument to perform spectral analysis of ecosystems stressed by crude oil. The acquisition of this instrument will significantly enhance the capabilities of the Computer Vision and Image Analysis Laboratory (CVIAL) at Texas Tech University to enable hands-on research experience for graduate and undergraduate students in imaging spectroscopy and hyperspectral remote sensing with broad applications in disaster response, environmental monitoring, and national defense.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,1058444,,,,,,,,Texas Tech University,,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:14053010,,

This sedimentary package is characterised by broad synclines aftemating with NE-SW trending anticlines, and is affected by numerous NE-SW, NW-SE and E-W striking faults. Oligo-Miocene sandstones constitute the most important potential reservoir rocks in the region.The distribution of subsurface temperatures in the Cap Bon basin reflects local groundwater circulation patterns and correlates with the location of known oil and gas fields. The results of geothermal studies could therefore prove useful in the search for new hydrocarbon resources in the region. Subsurface temperatures were measured in deep oil exploration and shallow water wells. Local geothermal gradients range from 25 to 35 degrees C/km, showing higher values in the Korbous and Zennia areas, which correspond to zones of groundwater discharge and convergence in the Oligo-Miocene aquifer system, respectively.Analysis of thermo-hydraulic and geochemical data relative to the thermal springs in the Korbous region along the Mediterranean coast has made a useful contribution to geothermal prospecting for potential deep reservoirs. Positive geothermal gradient anomalies correspond to areas of ascending thermal waters (i.e. discharge areas), whereas negative anomalies indicate areas of infiltrating colder meteoric waters (i.e. recharge areas).

They led to a rapid development of international seaborne trade and an increase in the number of global vessels. Air pollution from these ships is of great concerns and regulations are currently enforced since May 2005 by the International Maritime Organization to limit such pollution. In this study, we will first review the current global energy demand and its driving forces over next decades, second evaluate the existing alternative fuels that can be used as a bunker fuel to reach sustainability with relatively small changes in the existing marine propulsion options and finally focus on near-term solution, which has the potential for large-scale use. The different alternative fuels were compared in terms of several parameters such as availability, renewability, safety, cost, performance, economy and compliance with emission regulations. This comparison revealed that liquefied natural gas could be considered as the future replacement to the current marine bunker fuel. This conclusion has been further verified by comparing diesel engine with different powers when using both heavy fuel oil and liquefied natural gas. The engines were compared against fuel consumption, cost saving as well as emissions. Liquefied natural gas has proved to be better than heavy fuel oil due to fuel cost reduction by about 31% per year and decrease in emissions of SOx, NOx, CO2 and particulate matter by about 98%, 86%, 11% and 96%, respectively.

This work presents the preliminary design and performance assessment of an innovative type of CAES, based on underwater storage volumes (UW-CAES) and intended for installation in the proximity of deep water seas or lakes. The UW-CAES works with constant hydrostatic pressure storage and variable volumes. The proposed system is adiabatic, not using any fuel to increase the air temperature before expansion; a sufficient TIT is instead obtained through a thermal energy storage system which recovers the compression heat. The system includes (i) a set of turbomachines (modular multi -stage compressor, with partial intercooling; expansion turbine); (ii) a thermal energy storage (TES) system with different temperature levels designed to recover a large fraction of the compression heat, allowing the subsequent heating of air prior to the expansion phase; (iii) an underwater modular compressed air storage, conceived as a network of rigid but open tanks lying on the seabed and allowing a variable-volume and constant pressure operation. The compressor operates at variable loads, following an oscillating renewable power input, according to strategies oriented to improve the overall system dispatchability; the expander can be designed to work either at full load, thanks to the stability of the air flow rate and of the TIT guaranteed by the thermal storage, or at variable load. The paper first discusses in detail the sizing and off-design characterization of the overall system; it is then simulated a case study where the UW-CAES is coupled to a wind farm for peak shaving and dispatchability enhancement, evaluating the impact of a realistic power input on performances and plant flexibility. Although the assessment shall be considered preliminary, it is shown that round trip efficiency in the range of 75% - 80% can be obtained depending on the compressor section configuration; making the UW-CAES a promising technology compared to electrochemical and pumped-hydro storage systems. The technology is also applied to perform peak-shaving of the electricity production from a wind park; annual simulations considering part load operation result in global round trip efficiency around 75% with a 10 to 15% reduction in the average unplanned energy injection in the electric grid.

The study was carried out in altered areas where the management of jucara fruits was introduced at 'Serra do Mar' State Park-SP state, Brazil and its surroundings, including the phytophysiognomies Montane and Submontane Atlantic Forest. To represent all the different situations in which management is practiced, eight areas were selected and each one was allocated in a plot of 10 x 100 m divided into subplots of 10 x 10 m, in which all individuals trees were inventoried (trees, jucaras, banana trees and ferns) with DBH (diameter at breast height)> 4.8 cm.

Statistics suggest that one of the hotspots of abandoned cropland is located in the drylands of the Aral Sea Basin (ASB), which covers parts of post-Soviet Central Asia, Afghanistan and Iran. To date, the exact spatial and temporal extents of abandoned cropland remain unclear, which hampers land-use planning. Abandoned land is a potentially valuable resource for alternative land uses. Here, we mapped the abandoned cropland in the drylands of the ASB with a time series of the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) from 2003-2016. To overcome the restricted ability of a single classifier to accurately map land-use classes across large areas and agro-environmental gradients, stratum-specific classifiers were calibrated and classification results were fused based on a locally weighted decision fusion approach. Next, the agro-ecological suitability of abandoned cropland areas was evaluated. The stratum-specific classification approach yielded an overall accuracy of 0.879, which was significantly more accurate ( < 0.05) than a global classification without stratification, which had an accuracy of 0.811. In 2016, the classification results showed that 13% (1.15 Mha) of the observed irrigated cropland in the ASB was idle (abandoned). Cropland abandonment occurred mostly in the Amudarya and Syrdarya downstream regions and was associated with degraded land and areas prone to water stress. Despite the almost twofold population growth and increasing food demand in the ASB area from 1990 to 2016, abandoned cropland was also located in areas with high suitability for farming. The map of abandoned cropland areas provides a novel basis for assessing the causes leading to abandoned cropland in the ASB. This contributes to assessing the suitability of abandoned cropland for food or bioenergy production, carbon storage, or assessing the environmental trade-offs and social constraints of recultivation.",,,,,,,,,60,2,1,0,17,0,63,,,,2072-4292,,,,,,,,,,"Int Ctr Agr Res Dry Areas ICARDA, Cairo 11431, EgyptMapTailor Geospatial Consulting, D-53113 Bonn, GermanyUniv Copenhagen, Dept Geosci & Nat Resource Management IGN, DK-1165 Copenhagen, DenmarkLeibniz Inst Agr Dev Transit Econ IAMO, D-06120 Halle, Saale, GermanyKazan Fed Univ, Inst Environm Sci, Kazan 420008, RussiaCatholic Univ Louvain, Earth & Life Inst Environm, 2 Croix Sud, B-1348 Louvain La Neuve, BelgiumCSIRO Agr & Food, 306 Carmody Rd, St Lucia, Qld 4067, AustraliaRhein Friedrich Wilhelms Univ, Dept Geog, D-53113 Bonn, Germany",MapTailor Geospatial Consulting,,,2018-12-28,WOS:000427542100006,,

Against the backdrop of the progressive externalization of European borders, the Libyan coast has become a hecatomb for young Malian migrant 'adventurers'. In 2015, around 360 young people from the region of Kayes, in the Southwest of Mali, lost their lives. Under the pressure of civil society associations, the government of Mali decreed days of National Mourning in memory of the shipwrecked. Simultaneously the transnational network Afrique-Europe-Interact in collaboration with representatives of the city of Kita, organized a politically ritualized ceremony to carry out sacrifices honoring the deaths. Based on an ethnography of this mourning ceremony, the article shows how civil society actors denounce the appropriation of the tragic events by a state that expels its citizens incapable to develop and the European Union that kills by externalizing borders. A short media analysis of the government's celebration serves as a contrast to the civil society engagement. Through these competing memorial strategies, the article presents the antagonistic but overlapping positionings between the public authorities with their northern partners condemning irregular migration, and the bereaved populations and the civil society considering migration as a normal strategy for a better life and cultural heritage. Our analysis reveals that the celebration of the International Migrants Day and the National Day of Mourning have led to the construction of alternative discourses on 'irregular' migration that call to account externalization and neoliberal policies and the risk-taking attitude of migrants in migratory tragedies embedded in very localized mourning practices.",,,,,,,,,5,0,0,0,0,2,8,,,,2214-594X,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Lettres & Sci Humaines Bamako ULSHB, Inst Super Format & Rech Appl ISFRA, Dept Sociol & Anthropol, Campus Kabala,BP 3637, Bamako, MaliBielefeld Univ, Bielefeld Grad Sch Hist & Sociol BGHS, Univ Str 25, D-33615 Bielefeld, Germany",Univ Lettres & Sci Humaines Bamako ULSHB,,,2020-01-22,WOS:000701899100001,,

The location and latitudinal range of the ITCZ in this basin is inseparably tied to ENSO dynamics and to the strength of the equatorial upwelling, which affect global climate through various mechanisms such as ENSO teleconnections. Moreover, anomalous tropical rainfall patterns due to ITCZ shifts can impact the ocean's thermohaline circulation through control of surface salinity, and alter moisture and ecosystem balance over land triggering climate feedbacks via land-vegetation and biogeochemical processes (e.g. methane emissions and carbon storage). The proponents propose a study to investigate variability in this system in the orbital frequency band, encompassing the interval 0-250,000 years BP, which includes glacial stages 2, 6 and 8, and interglacial stages 1, 5 and 7. This is sufficiently long to discern glacial-interglacial (G-I) (100 ky) variability in addition to precession and obliquity forcing (19-23 ky, and 41 ky).

The creation of vehicle trails on the tundra from seismic exploration for on has accelerated in the past decade, and the cumulative impact represents a geographic footprint that covers a greater extent of Alaska's North Slope tundra than all other direct human impacts combined. Seismic exploration for on and gas was conducted on the coastal plain of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, Alaska, USA, in the winters of 1984 and 1985.

Paired permanent vegetation plots (disturbed VS. reference) were monitored six times from 1984 to 2002. Data were collected on percent vegetative cover by plant species and on soil and ground ice characteristics. We developed Bayesian hierarchical models, with temporally and spatially autocorrelated errors, to analyze the effects of vegetation type and initial disturbance levels on recovery patterns of the different plant growth forms as well as soil thaw depth. Plant community composition was altered on the trails by species-specific responses to initial disturbance and subsequent changes in Substrate. Long-term changes included increased cover of graminoids and decreased cover of evergreen shrubs and mosses. Trails With low levels of initial disturbance usually improved well over time, whereas those with medium to high levels of initial disturbance recovered Slowly. Trails On ice-poor, gravel substrates of riparian areas recovered better than those on ice-rich loamy soils of the uplands, even alter severe initial damage.

When we consider offshore oil production platforms, wells that require gas-lift technology to yield oil production from low pressure oil reservoirs can become unstable under some conditions. This undesirable phenomenon is usually called slugging flow, and can be identified by an oscillatory behavior of the downhole pressure measurement. Given the importance of this measurement and the unreliability of the related sensor, this work aims at designing data-driven soft-sensors for downhole pressure estimation in two contexts: one for speeding up first-principle model simulation of a vertical riser model; and another for estimating the downhole pressure using real-world data from an oil well from Petrobras based only on topside platform measurements. Both tasks are tackled by employing Echo State Networks (ESN) as an efficient technique for training Recurrent Neural Networks. We show that a single ESN is capable of robustly modeling both the slugging flow behavior and a steady state based only on a square wave input signal representing the production choke opening in the vertical riser. Besides, we compare the performance of a standard network to the performance of a multiple timescale hierarchical architecture in the second task and show that the latter architecture performs better in modeling both large irregular transients and more commonly occurring small oscillations.

Not only GNSS systems like GPS or the future Galileo can enhance maritime navigation either in open sea, inland waterways and harbour entrances and approaches; but positioning based on GNSS technology can be used for a wide range of maritime applications. These include, but are not limited to: traffic management, traffic surveillance, search and rescue, fishing, marine engineering, oceanography, port operations, and oil and gas exploitation.Some GNSS-based technologies are being promoted at international level such as the e-Navigation initiative from the International Maritime Organization (IMO), as well as the Vessel Monitoring System (VMS) used by fishing authorities, or the Automatic Identification System (AIS).Satellite Based Augmentation Systems (SBAS) such as EGNOS in Europe, WAAS in North America, MSAS in Japan and GAGAN in India can enhance core GNSS constellation's performances, with special focus on accuracy, availability, continuity and integrity. In particular, the integrity feature has been traditionally associated to Safety-of-Life applications, mainly for aviation. However, in the recent years integrity has also been identified as an added value for many other GNSS application fields given that it increases safety and can be used for certified services.On the other hand, not only many GNSS devices installed on leisure vessels already integrate SBAS corrections but also SBAS information can be integrated in already existing maritime systems and aids to navigation infrastructure such as in AIS and DGNSS, therefore, making the maritime sector one of the relevant fields for the SBAS adoption.In this context, GMV has developed magicVRS as an example of how GNSS technology can enhance maritime navigation. This tool takes as input SBAS corrections which are translated into differential corrections that will be redirected to an AIS base station and then broadcast to a GNSS device on-board. These SBAS corrections can be received either from the internet using ESA's SISNeT protocol or from a devoted receiver connected to magicVRS.To demonstrate the performance benefits derived from this tool, a series of maritime trials have been launched in the Guadalquivir River (Spain) and in Cape Town (South Africa) using two types of SBAS data:nominal SBAS messages were obtained in Spain from EGNOS through EDAS service (Spain).the SBAS messages were coming from the SBAS testbed deployed in South Africa within the SBAS Africa project led by AVANTI.Both trials took advantage of the large GMV experience in developing SBAS algorithms through magicSBAS tool so magicVRS was fed with SBAS messages produced by magicSBAS in real-time, broadcasting optimized information for being applied to maritime applications.magicSBAS is an SBAS demonstrator that collects multi-constellation GNSS data (measurements and ephemeris) from a regional network of reference stations, computes satellite orbits and clocks corrections and ionospheric and integrity information in accordance with ICAO SARPS standards. In previous papers presented at ION-GNSS it has been demonstrated how GMV's low latitude ionospheric algorithms can enhance SBAS performance on Equatorial regions [1]. During the last year, internal research has been performed at GMV to provide improved accuracy and integrity performances for maritime applications, and these improved algorithms were used in the maritime trials in Europe and Africa, whose results are summarized in this paper. magicSBAS can also be complemented with magicGNSS suite, in particular to magicODTS to provide precise orbit determination and time synchronization of GNSS satellites that enhances even more the SBAS corrections assessment.The SBAS-Africa project, led by AVANTI, in partnership with GMV, NSL, Pildo Labs, TAS UK, the South African National Space Agency (SANSA), Ghana Council for Scientific and Industrial Research and the Agency for Aerial Navigation Safety in Africa and Madagascar (ASECNA), delivered a live SBAS signal in space serving the southern part of the African continent. The system generates SBAS messages using GMV's magicSBAS tool suite with input data from a network of GPS ground monitoring stations developed by NSL which are deployed across South Africa and neighbouring countries. The messages are broadcast via the ARTEMIS GEO satellite originally an ESA EGNOS satellite now owned by Avanti. The system provides an immediate improvement of GPS accuracy having far-reaching benefits across a range of user communities and applications, such as precision agriculture or general aviation.The paper will analyse the combined use of magicSBAS improved algorithms for maritime applications and magicODTS to determine the accuracy and integrity improvement derived from the use of these algorithms, and how this improvement could positively impact achieved performance in maritime applications. The results of these maritime trials in Europe and Africa and the comparison of the different technologies will also be provided in this paper as well as a presentation of the benefits of using enhanced GNSS systems for maritime navigation.",,,,,29th International Technical Meeting of The-Satellite-Division-of-the-Institute-of-Navigation (ION GNSS+)29th International Technical Meeting of The-Satellite-Division-of-the-Institute-of-Navigation (ION GNSS+),"SEP 12-16, 2016SEP 12-16, 2016","Inst Navigat, Satellite DivInst Navigat, Satellite Div","Portland, ORPortland, OR",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,2331-5911,2331-5954,*****************,,,,,,,,,"GMV, Tres Cantos, SpainAVANTI Commun, Melksham, EnglandKongsberg Seatex, Trondheim, NorwayEuropean Space Agcy, F-75738 Paris 15, France",GMVAVANTI CommunKongsberg Seatex,,,2017-02-08,WOS:000391479503039,,

Some of these resources would be either uneconomical if extracted using conventional overbalanced drilling due to increased drilling problems and prolonged non-productive time, or too risky to adopt underbalanced drilling technique. Seeking new ways to reduce drilling cost and minimize risks has led to the development of managed pressure drilling techniques. Managed pressure drilling methods address the drawbacks of conventional overbalanced and underbalanced drilling techniques. As managed pressure drilling techniques are evolving, there are many unanswered questions related to safety and operating pressure regime. This study investigates the safety and operational issues of constant bottom-hole pressure drilling technique which is used in managed pressure drilling compared to conventional overbalanced drilling. The study first uses bow-tie models to map safety challenges and operating pressure regimes in constant bottom-hole pressure drilling technique. Due to the difficulties in modeling dependencies and updating the belief on the operational data, the bow-ties are mapped into Bayesian networks. The Bayesian networks are thoroughly analyzed to assess the safety critical elements of constant bottom-hole pressure drilling techniques and their safe operating pressure regime.

There is an increasing tendency to implement S-shaped risers for offshore platforms operating in deep waters or harsh environments. However, a generic S shape may cause a terrain-induced, severe slugging under certain practical operational/geometrical conditions and flow rates. This phenomenon leads to unstable and intermittent slug flows creating fluctuations of pressure, fluid fraction and velocity components. In this paper, the flow pattern characteristics and formation process of a severe slugging in an S-shaped rigid riser transporting the liquid-gas flows are studied using 3-D computational fluid dynamics simulations based on a finite volume method.

These assets have a design life and are susceptible to damage from various factors during its operation. Operators should have in place a comprehensive Emergency Pipeline Repair System (EPRS). The EPRS should entail rigorous measures to minimize loss of production, the potential consequences of catastrophes and adverse effects on environment in case of an unforeseen event such as pipeline rupture or spill. The system should ensure swift response to restore the mechanical integrity of a damaged section whilst maintaining high HSE standards and minimizing the production shutdown-time duration. Accidental damages call for remedial response actions on an emergency basis. Considering short lengths of pipeline to be replaced, tow technique can offer an effective alternative to the time consuming and expensive conventional pipe-lay barge operations.An installation method constituting the tow technique is proposed as a part of EPRS to replace damaged section of an operational pipeline. The paper discusses the applicable scenarios, the installation criteria and operational constraints involved in entire set of activities based on the study undertaken. The scenario analyzed involves launching a prefabricated pipe string offshore, towing and lay down at repair location. The pipe string is launched from an onshore facility by means of a lead tug, facilitated by rollers placed at designed intervals. The onerous task of pulling the pipe strings through long stretches of shallow water depths emphasizes the need of neutrally buoyant or slight positively buoyant pipe strings. Placing roller supports for the entire stretch is likely to pose several practical and economic constraints. The pipe string is towed to the intended offshore repair location with the assistance of a trailing tug. The pipe strings are laid down at the intended location in a controlled manner by means of winches and sequential release of buoys.Numerical models of the system for towing and laydown operations are developed and related investigations are undertaken to evaluate the installation parameters, supplementary buoyancy requirements and to assess the criticality at various stages of installation. Further, the limiting weather criteria to carry out the operation are established based on the wave and current imposed hydrodynamic loadings on the strings and several governing parameters.

PW refers to any fossil water that is brought to the surface along with crude oil or natural gas. It is a complex mixture of dispersed oil, dissolved organic compounds, suspended solids, production chemicals, heavy metals, and natural radioactive minerals. PW is difficult to handle/treat and represents the largest volume of waste associated with the oil and gas industry. It can have different potential impacts on offshore or onshore environments depending on where it is discharged. Therefore, the development of effective treatment technologies for PW is essential from both ecological and economic standpoints. The first stage of any treatment process for PW consists of a significant reduction in the level of dispersed hydrocarbons and suspended solids. In a second and often in a third stage, the oil and total carbon (TC) content is reduced by hydrocyclones and by micro-and ultrafiltration using membrane technologies. Due to legal requirements, final oil contents below 10 ppm are required in some regions before PW disposal to the environment. CHFMs represent a new generation in the development of inorganic membranes by offering the advantages of one membrane consisting of both inorganic material and hollow fiber geometry. In this study, the effect of cross-flow velocity on the CHFM performance at a low trans-membrane pressure of 0.5 bar, as well as the permeate quantity and quality, was investigated in terms of fouling behavior and efficiency of oil and TC removal. In the filtration system presented here, using ceramic hollow fiber ultrafiltration (UF) membranes with a d(90) pore diameter of 40 nm, the removal of oil and TC from samples of tank dewatering produced water and oily model systems, was successfully demonstrated with a remarkable decontamination efficiency of >99.5% (oil) and 61-94% (TC), respectively.",,,,,Conference on Desalination for the Environment - Clean Water and EnergyConference on Desalination for the Environment - Clean Water and Energy,"MAY 11-15, 2014MAY 11-15, 2014",,"Limassol, CYPRUSLimassol, CYPRUS",20,0,0,0,5,0,20,,,1944-3994,1944-3986,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Appl Sci Mittelhessen, Inst Bioproc Engn & Membrane Technol, Giessen, GermanyEhc Memtec UG, Giessen, GermanyMANN HUMMEL GmbH, Ludwigsburg, GermanyKansas State Univ, Dept Chem Engn, Manhattan, KS 66506 USA",Univ Appl Sci MittelhessenEhc Memtec UGMANN HUMMEL GmbH,,,2015-01-01,WOS:000363456300010,,

The resulting risk is evaluated from four different perspectives. Bayesian networks enable large amounts of information about causalities to be integrated and utilized in probabilistic inference.

The world's dependence on unsustainable fossil fuels (almost 90%), and the increasing population demand new sources of energy for sustainable human activities. Algae, and particularly microalgae have nowadays become of enormous importance as a new potential source of feedstock for renewable bioenergy production. As photosynthetic microorganisms, microalgae may potentially be produced as carbon neutral and can be produced on non-arable land and cultured in marine and wastewater effluents. Furthermore, microalgae can be used to produce a range of products such as protein-rich animal feed in aquaculture, high-value products, viz, polyunsaturated fatty acids, bioactive and functional pigments and natural dyes, health foods, cosmetics, and pharmaceuticals. In this chapter, an update of the advances in microalgal biotechnology is presented as a new biomass for the potential development of biofuels, and as a realistic source of highly valuable molecules of industrial interest. The potential to harness endogenous carbon storage compounds, triacylglyceride (TAGs) and starch, as products of photosynthesis, including the photoproduction of hydrogen, can contribute to diversify the sources and yields of feedstocks for biofuel production. Even if the production of microalgae for biofuels is highly promissory and clearly has potential for contributing to environmental, social, and economic sustainability, presently this alternative is unsustainable. Definitely, the combination of biofuel production by microalgal biotechnology with co-products may contribute to the sustainability of biofuels, a condition with null or less impact on natural resources and biodiversity. The integration of all the components of the uses of microalgae, i.e., high-value compounds, aquaculture, and bioremediation coupled to the production of biofuels will play an important role in the near future to make the production of biofuels from microalgae sustainable.

The F-P framework included two key deterministic parameters, and , that, respectively, reflected the spatial origin attributes of sources and the time history of eroded material delivered to and collected at the watershed outlet. However, the deterministic treatment of and is limited to cases with well-defined spatial partitioning of sources, high sediment delivery, and relatively short travel times with little variability in transport within the watershed. For event-based studies in intensively managed landscapes, this may be inadequate since landscape heterogeneity results in variabilities in source contributions, their pathways, delivery times, and storage within the watershed.

To evaluate the effects of the treatments of and on source partitioning, both frameworks are applied to the South Amana Subwatershed (SASW) in the U.S. midwest.

To provide an accurate and concise representation of the riser's dynamic behavior, the flexible marine riser with vessel dynamics is described by a distributed parameter system with a partial differential equation (PDE) and four ordinary differential equations (ODEs). Boundary control is proposed at the top boundary of the riser based on Lyapunov's direct method to regulate the riser's vibration. Adaptive control is designed when the system parametric uncertainty exists. With the proposed robust adaptive boundary control, uniform boundedness under the ocean current disturbance can be achieved. The proposed control is implementable with actual instrumentation since all the required signals in the control can be measured by sensors or calculated by a backward difference algorithm. The state of the system is proven to converge to a small neighborhood of zero by appropriately choosing design parameters.

Water is used by the oil industry for ice road construction and maintenance, drilling and facility operations, and potable water supplies. The coastal plain between Teshekpuk Lake, in the National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska (NPR-A) and the Colville River has numerous shallow lakes, but further south in the northern foothills of the Brooks Range, and east to the Canning River, lakes are fewer. While many oil and gas lease sales have been conducted, or are proposed, access to the leases may be limited because of the lack of available water for ice road construction. Ice roads are the main means by which exploration is conducted in the Arctic, putting a stress on freshwater bodies that do not freeze to the lakebed in winter. Lakes that do not freeze to the lakebed also serve as overwintering habitat for fish. The purpose of this paper is to report on the potential distribution of water bodies that may provide overwinter water in selected areas from Teshekpuk Lake to the Canning River. The project used synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery to search for the presence of water in lakes in March 2006. In the Kuparuk and Canning SAR images, 52 and 61% of lakes were frozen to their beds by March 2006, accounting for 49 and 57% of the lake area in these study regions. Conversely, only 2% of the lakes in the Teshekpuk region were frozen to the bottom by March 2006. Unfrozen water was more available because of deeper and more numerous lakes in the Teshekpuk Lake region (west) than in the Canning River area (east). While only specific SAR tiles were analyzed herein, the method will be a useful tool for land managers who seek to evaluate the potential for ice road construction across the Arctic.",,,,,,,,,16,1,0,0,8,0,18,,,1093-474X,1752-1688,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Alaska Fairbanks, Inst No Engn, Fairbanks, AK 99775 USAUniv Alaska Fairbanks, Water & Environm Res Ctr, Fairbanks, AK 99775 USAGeowatersheds Sci, Fairbanks, AK 99775 USA",Geowatersheds Sci,,,2008-04-01,WOS:000254741500002,,

Ocean observations from the period 1981-2011 will be assimilated into ROMS, in conjunction with the best available estimates of ocean surface forcing and open boundary conditions. The goals of this research project are: (1) To perform retrospective analyses of the ocean circulation during the last 3 decades; (2) Use the analyses to document and understand changes in spring-summer stratification and how these changes, along with variations in wind-stress and wind-stress curl, influence upwelling intensity and upwelling source water depth; (3) Identify the dominant space-time modes of circulation variability on intraseasonal-to-interannual and decadal timescales and how these modes are related to climate modes such as the Pacific decadal Oscillation and North Pacific Gyre Oscillation; (4) Quantify the impact on the analyses of the in situ and satellite observing networks; (5) Make the circulation analyses available via a data server to the community at large for scientific and marine resource management applications. Intellectual merit This research will yield the first analyses of the California Current System circulation generated by a regional ocean model forced by the best available ocean surface fluxes from regional atmospheric models. Also, this assimilative ocean model is unique in that it provides formal estimates of the expected error in the analyses, and provides a quantitative assessment of the impact of each individual observation on any aspect of the resulting circulation estimates. Analysis error estimates are critically important for establishing confidence in the analyses, and observation impact and observation sensitivity studies can be used in the future to design optimal observing arrays. A by-product of the proposed analyses are fields of surface forcing and open boundary condition corrections that provide information about potential errors in these fields and errors in the model. The investigators are a uniquely qualified and experienced team of ocean modelers, all with considerable experience in both modeling the CCS and 4D-Var data assimilation, and the lead investigator is one of the lead developers of the ROMS 4D-Var system. Broader impacts The proposed retrospective ocean analyses are significant for a number of reasons: (i) They can be used to quantify variability on weekly to decadal timescales, and trends in the dominant circulation features, particularly in subsurface regions that are not well observed; (ii) They provide complete realizations of the circulation at high temporal resolution on the full grid of the model that are largely free of the sampling and aliasing issues that often plague observations; (iii) They can be used to test hypotheses about ocean dynamics, climate variability, and climate change. The resulting analyses will form a valuable community resource in the form of a data archive that can be used for numerous applications, including: process studies of the CCS; input for driving offline ecosystem and individual based models; a source of open boundary conditions for higher resolution models nested within the native ROMS CCS grid; and initial conditions for the development of ocean hindcasting/forecasting systems, to name but a few. This project will also provide training for a graduate student and post-doctoral researchers in advanced 4D-Var data assimilation methods, since it is important that we continue to train the next generation of ocean data assimilators. The proposed research will also use the adjoint of 4D-Var which is an original and transformative aspect of this work. This project will also complement the NSF Ocean Observatories Initiative, and will support synthesis activities, development of user products, and array assessment within the U.S. Integrated Ocean Observing Systems along the U.S. west coast.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,1061434,,,,,,,,University of California-Santa Cruz,,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:14014617,,

This paper proposes an approach for linking a highly detailed storyline with multiple, diverse models. This approach is illustrated through a cross-scale study of the UK power system transition until 2050. The storyline, called Central Coordination, is linked with insights from six power system models and two appraisal techniques. First, the storyline is 'translated' into harmonised assumptions on power system targets for the models. Then, a new concept called the landscape of models is introduced. This landscape helps to map the key fields of expertise of individual models, including their temporal, spatial and disciplinary foci. The storyline is then assessed based on the cross-scale modelling results. While the storyline is important for transmitting information about governance and the choices of key actors, many targets aspired in it are inconsistent with modelling results. The storyline overestimates demand reduction levels, uptake of marine renewables and irreplaceability of carbon capture and storage. It underestimates the supply-demand balancing challenge, the need for back-up capacity and the role of nuclear power and interconnectors with Europe. Thus, iteratively linking storylines and models is key. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

Respecting UNESCO's Convention on the Protection of the Underwater Cultural Heritage'' principles, the UAPs were classified for the first time in 2005 and are unique in the Portuguese context. Due to the autonomy that this ultraperipheral European Region has in terms of cultural heritage management, this structure arises from a specific law in 2005 formulated by initiative of the Azores Regional Government. At the same time, the archipelago's marine biodiversity richness has become one of the most attractive elements for tourism in the islands.The main goal of this paper is to reflect on these two important identity elements of the Azores: on a cultural and environmental level. We try to understand if there is any interaction and symbiotic relation between the UPAs and their growing biodiversity due to the classification. For this purpose, the Angra UAP in Terceira and Dori UAP in S. Miguel will be presented.In both cases, the cultural element was mandatory for the classification and protection of the sites. This first attempt to combine marine biota data together with archaeological data proposes to create a precedent. In fact, the empirical perception of archaeologists, biologists and divers who visit the parks is that the biodiversity has increased with the protection measures. However, we need elements that are more accurate in order to define that.The main goal of this paper is to identify the marine species present in Angra for the first time. It will also create a reference for future evaluation regarding the symbiotic relation between the two UAP dimensions.

Therefore, there is need to grow or add to the existing reserves through searching wider and drilling deeper across the onshore sector of the Niger Delta Basin, which is the focus of this work. Although, there has been several hydrocarbon prospectivity studies in the Onshore Niger Delta Basin, most of these studies were conducted on individual fields, except where adjacent fields belonged to the same operator. This has provided limited information on stratigraphic intervals, structural features and reservoir zones continuity across several fields. This study is aimed at interpreting recently acquired within the Coastal Swamp Depobelt of the Niger Delta, long-cable regional 3D seismic data over nine producing fields, and data from twenty-five wells, using sequence stratigraphic, structural and reservoir exploration tools, thus providing a regional scale interpretation and information that will unravel new prospective zones across these fields primarily based on amplitude supported structural plays. Results from stratigraphic studies, show the occurrence of regional extensive chrono/sequence stratigraphic surfaces such as maximum flooding surfaces (7.4-12.8 Ma) and sequence boundaries (8.5-13.1 Ma) that depict sediment packages deposited during the Middle-Miocene through Upper Miocene age. Well log sequence stratigraphic and reservoir correlation studies reveal that depositional sequences, bounded by these surfaces, comprise reservoir and non-reservoir packages within their systems tracts. Reservoir architectural studies show sands of lowstand, transgressive, and highstand systems tracts that make up the reservoir units, are relatively thick, laterally continuous and quite extensive across the area. Interpreted seismic sections unravelled the influence of structure on stratigraphy as sediment packages show variable thicknesses across faults. This was linked to syndepositional deformation associated with sediment deposition within the basin. Mapped reservoir tops at intermediate and deeper intervals reveal the dominance of fault-dependent closures. In addition, root mean square amplitude extraction done on these maps, unravelled eight structurally controlled regional hydrocarbon prospects and eight leads with booming amplitude responses that are conformable to structures. Overall, this study has shown that there exist hydrocarbon prospective zones that cut across several fields at deeper depths that are yet to be drilled, which could contribute to the Niger Delta Basin's existing reserve base.",,,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,,,1464-343X,1879-1956,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Nigeria, Dept Geol, Nsukka, Enugu State, NigeriaShell Petr Dev Co, Port Harcourt, Rivers State, Nigeria",,,,2020-04-30,WOS:000526109500024,,

Simultaneously produced water and maturity of producing fields are increasing gradually, which creates a major challenge for E&P companies. Economically it is very important to isolate reservoir compartments with a high water cut, to guarantee maximum oil production and an effective utilization of processing facilities. Having all reservoir compartments on the nearby level of produced water would require opening isolated sections to increase daily production. Additionally oil and gas prices play a major role in reopening isolated pay zones. This was carried out in two wells within the Mittelplate oilfield, North Sea. The Mittelplate oil field is located within a highly sensitive environmental area in northern Germany. To be precise, it is a protected landscape for migratory birds (Wadden Sea, UNESCO World Natural Heritage Site Enclaves).Production of Dieksand (as part of Mittelplate oilfield) extended reach wells started 2001/02, after three years of production. Permanent bridge plugs were installed to isolate lower reservoir compartments, due to increased water cut. Milling those permanent bridge plugs, at a measured depth of nearly 8000 m (26,240 ft), was executed in 2014. Those specific well bores are extended reach wells, with a total measured depth of nearly 9000 m (29,520 ft). To provide a circulation, upper compartments were killed. Killing producing zones without damaging the reservoir was one of the major targets. After some eight years of production sand deposition was an additional challenge in both wells, resulting in higher operational torques. Hence the cleaning operation had to be customized to counter mentioned torque challenges.Research confirmed that those were the first two bridge plugs worldwide to be milled out in extended reach wells, within a horizontal section of 82 deviation, at nearly 8000 m (26,240 ft) measured depth. Both heavy workover operations were a major success and supplemented a notable oil production to the Holstein operational district.

The risk management output will provide operators a real time risk status and pre-warnings of possible deviations in the system. This framework is developed to support the decision-making process of the operators with providing failure probability of alternative decision scenarios, and it can be applied to any other engineering system and operation.In order to validate the effectiveness of the framework, DP drilling operations are considered as a case study.

In contrast, the uppermost part of the Silurian deposits becomes progressively coarser and fluvial in response to the progradation of the North African Akakus deltaic system, during regional sea level fall and uplifting of the region. These progradational deposits exhibit well-preserved trace fossils with moderate to high degree of bioturbation, such as Skolithos or the so-called Tigillites pipe-rock, Cruziana isp., Rusophycus isp., Monocraterion isp., and Syringomorpha.& para;& para;The SIL-1 MS is bounded by a post-glacial latest Hirnantian unconformity on the basal (SB1), as confirmed by the moderately diverse early Silurian graptolite faunas, and by the Caledonian unconformity on the top (SB7). Each of the three formations of SIL-1 MS reveals two major 3rd-order progradational sequences, commonly delineated by discontinuity surfaces (in ascending order, SB1 to SB7), and in turn, these six sequences (i.e. Si-1 to Si-6) are subdivided into at least ten shorter-term cycles. The regional extent of each unconformity is directly linked to significant fades changes and to inflection points on the global sea level curve. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

The heritage tourism at the site of the ship USAT Liberty in the small fishing village of Tulamben on the northeast coast of Bali Island plays a significant role in the lives of the local people who live nearby, who actively participate in the site's management. Design/methodology/approach This study assessed the management of the site by the local community by means of formal interviews with major stakeholders, informal conversations, and observations in the field. Findings Although it lacks any direct historical connection with the local community, the reuse of the shipwreck as a tourist asset has motivated the community to participate in the conservation of the site and sustain its values. This article argues that the case of the USAT Liberty demonstrates that the management of heritage sites can be effectively sustained using bottom-up approaches. Originality/value The USAT Liberty case study provides insights and practical recommendations that could be valuable for other cultural heritage sites in implementing management with a bottom-up approach.

Using input-output techniques and a derived Resource Flow Classification System, both the physical trade balance (PTB) and pollution trade balance (UTB) associated with fossil resource use are computed. The PTB shows that between 1968 and the early 1980's the UK is presented as a net importer of direct fossil resource flows. Between 1984 and 2000, the UK is identified as a net exporter of direct fossil resources. These trends are primarily explained by the UK's discovery and commercial production of North Sea oil and gas fields in the late 1970s. on the other hand, the UTB shows that over the whole period the indirect used flows attributable to the UK's exports are higher than those attributable to its imports. These findings suggest that the UK did not create pollution havens abroad from the use of fossil resources between 1968 and 2000. However, it is noticeable in both cases that from 1995 the UK's position as a net exporter has been decreasing considerably. Maturing North Sea oil and gas fields set against increasing demands for fossil fuels and imported goods is signalling a return to the UK's pre-1984 dependence on direct imported fossil resources and the possible creation of pollution havens abroad. Knowledge of these trends contributes to the evidence base for the UK's changing import and export structure and the potential environmental repercussions at home and abroad. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

The analytical methods involved the use of deuterated analogues of the toxins to account for losses of analytes during recovery by steam distillation and determination by cryogenic GC-MS selected ion monitoring of molecular ions, Although the organisms were impacted by oil, the concentrations of total determinants in dead razor shells collected just after tbe oil spill were below the tissue effective concentrations for 50% reduction in filtering activity (TEC(50)) for mussels (the most valid toxicological data available for comparative purposes). A portion of the unresolved monoaromatic hydrocarbons of Gullfaks crude would probably add to the burden of toxins, but this was not measured in this study, The distribution of aromatic hydrocarbons in the organisms (phenanthrenes > naphthalenes > toluene) was the reverse of that in the oil and correlates with the expected bioconcentration behaviour of hydrophobic organics whereby less water soluble compounds with higher octanol-water partition coefficients are concentrated. Concentrations of naphthalene to methylphenanthrenes in limpets collected in January at the time of the spill from sites close to the wreck were wen below the TEC(50) values for mussels but comparison with the lower concentrations in limpets from a more remote site in Shetland indicated that the oil had impacted organisms near to tbe spill, consistent with intertidal survey data. Comparison with limited literature data for limpets and more extensive data for mussels also supported this conclusion, as did the identification of the oil residues in the limpets by biomarker fingerprinting. As with the razor shells, bioconcentration of the more hydrophobic compounds was observed. Concentrations in Shetland limpets generally decreased with increasing distance from the spill site.Concentrations of aromatic hydrocarbons decreased with time after the spill, such that by July concentrations were at what can reasonably be assumed to be background levels, comparable to the concentrations found at all times in the more remote site, Concentrations in a limited number of samples collected 15 months after the spill, following a further winter of storms in which sediment-sorbed oil could have been reintroduced to the limpets, showed no Increase.

After the Prestige petroleum tanker sank off northern Spain in 2002 and the Deepwater Horizon oil rig catastrophe in 2009, subjects involved in environmental decontamination showed signs of ongoing or residual lung disease up to 5 y after the exposure.OBJECTIVES: We aimed at investigating mechanisms driving persistent respiratory disease by developing an animal model of inhalational exposure to fuel oil-derived VOCs.METHODS: Female Wistar and Brown Norway (BN) rats and C57BL mice were exposed to VOCs produced from fuel oil mimicking the Prestige spill. Exposed animals inhaled the VOCs 2 h daily, 5 d per week, for 3 wk. Airway responsiveness to mcthacholine (MCh) was assessed, and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) and lung tissues were analyzed after the exposure and following a 2-wk washout.RESULTS: Consistent with data from human studies, both strains of rats that inhaled fuel oil-derived VOCs developed airway hyperresponsiveness that persisted after the washout period, in the absence of detectable inflammation in any lung compartment. Histopathology and quantitative morphology revealed the development of peripherally distributed pulmonary emphysema, which persisted after the washout period, associated with increased alveolar septal cell apoptosis, microvascular endothelial damage of the lung parenchyma, and inhibited expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF).DISCUSSION: In this rat model, fuel oil VOCs inhalation elicited alveolar septal cell apoptosis, likely due to DNA damage. In turn, the development of a peculiar pulmonary emphysema pattern altered lung mechanics and caused persistent noninflammatory airway hyperresponsiveness. Such findings suggest to us that humans might also respond to VOCs through physiopathological pathways different from those chiefly involved in typical cigarette smoke-driven emphysema in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). If so, this study could form the basis for a novel disease mechanism for lasting respiratory disease following inhalational exposure to catastrophic fuel oil spills.",,,,,,,,,12,1,0,0,11,0,13,,,0091-6765,1552-9924,,,,,,,,,,"Complexo Hosp Univ, Resp Res Unit, La Coruna, SpainInst Invest Biomed A Coruna, La Coruna, SpainHosp Santa Creu & Sant Pau, Resp Dept, Barcelona, SpainBiomed Res Inst IIb St Pau, Barcelona, Spain",Biomed Res Inst IIb St Pau,,,2020-03-24,WOS:000518589800001,32074461,

The Middle to Upper Triassic rocks of the Schei Point Group (e.g. Murray Harbour and Hoyle Bay formations) contain a mixture of Types I and II organic matter (Tasmanales marine algae, amorphous fluorescing bituminite). These source rocks are within the oil generation zone and have HI values up to 600 mg HC/g Corg. The younger source rocks of the Lower Jurassic Jameson Bay and the Upper Jurassic Ringnes formations contain mainly gas-prone Type II/III organic matter and are marginally mature. Vitrinite reflectance profiles suggest an effective geothermal gradient essentially similar to the present-day gradient (20 to 30 degrees C/km). Maturation gradients are low, ranging from 0.125 to 0.185 log%Ro/km, increases in subsidence rate in the Early Cretaceous suggest that the actual heat flow history was variable and has probably diminished from that time. The high deposition rates of the Christopher Formation shales coincide with the main phase of rifting in Aptian-Albian times. Uplift and increased sediment supply in the Maastrichtian resulted in a new sedimentary and tectonic regime, which culminated in the final phase of the Eurekan Orogeny. Burial history models indicate that hydrocarbon generation in the Schei Point Group took place during rifting in Early Cretaceous, long before any Eurekan deformation.

Microbial mats sampled in a slightly polluted environment were exposed to contaminated water of a retention basin of an oil refinery. The responses of the microbial mats differed according to season. In spring 2012, strong inhibition of both oxygen production and respiration was observed relative to the control, with rates representing less than 5% of the control after 72 h of incubation. A decrease of microbial activities was followed by a decrease of the coupling between autotrophs and heterotrophs. In contrast, in autumn 2012, no significant changes for oxygen production and respiration were observed and the coupling between autotrophs and heterotrophs was not altered. The differences observed between the spring and autumn mats might be explained by the maturity of the microbial mat with dominance of heterotrophic bacteria in spring, and diatoms and cyanobacteria in autumn, as well as by the differences in the chemical composition of the complex mixture of PAHs and metals.

During close-to-port manoeuvres, propelling the ship in power-take-in (PTI) mode and generating the electric power by auxiliary engines rather than the main engine will reduce the local NOx and HC (hydrocarbons) emissions significantly. Sailing the ship on LNG will reduce the fuel consumption, CO2 and NOx emissions notably while producing higher HC emissions than traditional fuels.

The layers have a thickness of several mm to a maximum of 3-4 cm and can be defined as a clay-rich regional horizons extending for over 500 km. XRD showed that two principal clay minerals were predominant, namely a kaolinite group minerals, (kaolinite-rich) and a mixed-layer illite-smectite (WS) similar to that found in K-bentonite. Total organic matter in the luminescent layers is much lower than that in the enclosing BSF clayey-silty siliceous sediments above and below as shown by pyrolytic analyses. Evidence is presented that the luminescent characteristic of the argillites is related to their clay mineralogy, specifically to their content of kaolin minerals, although a contribution from nitrogenous organic matter cannot be entirely discounted. In some ways the luminescent argillites can be compared with bentonites associated with ash transformations or with tonsteins in coal beds, which are also derived from volcanic ash falls and contain highly crystalline kaolinite. However, tonsteins originate at or near land surface whereas the argillites were apparently formed in the deep ocean. But just as tonsteins can be used for detailed stratigraphic studies and are valuable in the context of coal exploration, so may the luminescent argillites prove to be significant both stratigraphically and in the search for economic hydrocarbon deposits, bearing in mind that their clay mineralogy may be sensitive to temperature and depth of burial and related to their placement in the oil and gas window.",,,,,,,,,12,3,3,0,0,0,15,,,0264-8172,1873-4073,,,,,,,,,,"Tomsk Polytech Univ, Tomsk, RussiaJames Hutton Inst, Dundee, ScotlandTomsk State Univ, Tomsk, RussiaUniv Leeds, Sch Chem & Proc Engn, Leeds, W Yorkshire, EnglandRAS, Inst Geol Ore Deposits Petrog Mineral & Geochem, IGEM, Moscow, RussiaLomonosov Moscow State Univ, Moscow, RussiaUniv Durham, Dept Phys, Durham, EnglandRAS, OGRI, Moscow, Russia",,,,2019-02-21,WOS:000458221100024,,

The effects of different injection rate shapes on the combustion and emission characteristics were studied to explore the appropriate gas injection rate shapes for a low-speed HPDI natural gas marine engine. A single-cylinder model was established and the CFD model was validated against experimental data from the literature; then, the combustion and emission characteristics of five different injection rate shapes were analyzed. The results showed that the peak values of in-cylinder pressure and heat release rate profiles of the triangle shape were highest due to the highest maximum injection rate, which occurred in a phase close to the top dead center. The shorter combustion duration of the triangle shape led to higher indicated mean effective pressure (IMEP) and NOx emissions compared with other shapes. The higher initial injection rates of the rectangle and slope shapes had a negative effect on the ignition delay periods of pilot fuel, which resulted in lower in-cylinder temperature and NOx emissions. However, due to the lower in-cylinder temperature, the engine power output was also lower. Otherwise, soot, unburned hydrocarbon (UHC), and CO emissions and indicated specific fuel consumption (ISFC) increased for both rectangle and slope shapes.

A correct approach starts from the preliminary phases of a project, with the selection of the most appropriate material in relation to the nature of the corrosive fluids and expected degradation mechanisms (i.e. general corrosion, localized or mesa corrosion and pitting). The construction phases include measures that allow meeting welding requirements and safe guarding the integrity of the line-pipe. The operation shall account for the control of process parameters and transported fluid composition.In the upcoming future offshore pipeline and field development projects, challenging operating conditions in deep/ultra-deep waters means that increasingly careful considerations on the effect of metal loss: corrosion leading to local loss of material may cause a potential pipeline failure under the additional effect of functional and environmental loads, in particular the high external pressure and applied bending moment. The assessment of the structural integrity depends on the type and accuracy of available measurements. In presence of corrosion patterns and accordingly to existing standards (DNV RP-F101, ASME B31G, API 579, BS 7910) the assessment might be unduly conservative; further the presence of important combined loads is not fully covered by standard assessment format.The use of ELM numerical lab can help the evaluation of the residual strength and deformation capacity of the pipeline affected by corrosion, leading to a quite-deterministic characterization of pipeline strength capacity at design stage and in operation. Several studies (both theoretical and experimental) available in the open literature faced this issue and their findings support the proposed analysis methodology. Recently full scale tests have been conducted by the relevant Oil & Gas industry companies (such as Statoil and ENI) and the obtained results have been used for the BE Model calibration and validation of corroded pipelines.

The samples are often well constrained stratigraphically and normally free from organic drilling fluid contamination. The focus of this study is the results obtained on one of the Ocean Drilling Program's (ODP) legs - Leg 159, which was located along the Equatorial portion of the West African margin, a region of considerable hydrocarbon exploration interest. Four drilling sites were included in Leg 159 along the continental margins of Cote d'Ivorie and Ghana. Drilling at these sites recovered sediments of Albian to Pleistocene age. Prior studies revealed the presence of a number of organic-rich zones capable of yielding significant quantities of hydrocarbons within both the Cretaceous and Tertiary sections. These intervals could act as hydrocarbon sources, if suitable maturity levels were obtained. Both oil and gas would be expected as their primary products. A shore-based study which focused on Site 959 and to a lesser degree Site 962 provided an opportunity to expand upon the original dataset and to further characterize the organic matter. Detailed characterization of the bitumen fractions from Site 959, provided not only information on the geochemical character of these specific sediments, but permitted them to be placed into a more regional context by comparing them to oils from the Equatorial portion of the West African margin. These data reveal a similarity, but not necessarily a genetic relationship, between the Cretaceous sediments and the majority of the Cote d'Ivoire oils. The Paleogene extracts display similar geochemical attributes as the deepwater oils from the Niger Delta. Although this study is not attempting to establish a definitive correlation, the data suggest a Tertiary source rock system for the deepwater Niger Delta, where deposition occurred under oxic to sub-oxic conditions. This contrasts with the Cote d'Ivoire where a Cretaceous source was effective and was deposited under sub-oxic to anoxic conditions. The absence of evidence for an effective deepwater Niger Delta Cretaceous source rock could be either a result of poor timing or the lack of migration pathways to the Miocene and younger reservoirs. The limited number of Tertiary-derived oils along the Cote d'Ivoire margin could be a result of the lack of sufficient overburden. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

Sound geochemical analyses and maturation modeling are essential elements for successful exploration and development, Oil has been produced in minor quantities from an Oligocene sill in the Mancos Shale within the sag, and major oil and gas production occurs from stratigraphically equivalent rocks in the San Juan basin to the southwest and in the Denver basin to the northeast.The objectives of this study were to identify potential source rocks, assess thermal maturity, and determine hydrocarbon-source bed relationships, Source rocks are present in the San Juan sag in the upper and lower Mancos Shale (including the Niobrara Member), which consists of about 666 m (2184 ft) of marine shale with from 0.5 to 3.1 wt % organic carbon. Pyrolysis yields (S-1 + S-2 2000-6000 ppm) and solvent extraction yields (1000-4000 ppm) indicate that some intervals within the Mancos hale are good potential source rocks for oil, containing type II organic matter, according to Rock-Eval pyrolysis assay. Oils produced from the San Juan sag and adjacent part of the San juan basin are geochemically similar to rock extracts obtained from these potential source rock intervals.Based on reconstruction of the geologic history of the basin integrated with models of organic maturation, we conclude that most of the source rock maturation occurred in the Oligocene and Miocene, Little to no maturation took place during Laramide subsidence of the basin, when the Animas and Blanco Basin formations were deposited, The timing of maturation is unlike that of most Laramide basins in the Rocky Mountain region, where maturation occurred as a result of Paleocene and Eocene basin fill, The present geothermal gradient in the San Juan sag is slightly higher (average 3.5 degrees C/100 m; 1.9 degrees F/100 ft) than the regional average for southern Rocky Mountain basins; however, although the sag contains intrusives and a volcanic cover, the gradient is significantly lower than that reported for parts of the adjacent San Juan basin (4.7 degrees C/100 m; 2.6 degrees F/100 ft). Burial depth appears to be a more important controlling factor in the thermal history of the source rocks than local variations in the geothermal gradient due to volcanic activity, Interestingly, the thick overburden of volcanic rocks appears to have provided the necessary burial depth for maturation.",,,,,,,,,21,3,0,0,1,0,26,,,0149-1423,,,,,,,,,,,"US GEOL SURVEY,DENVER FED CTR,DENVER,CO 80225PLATTE RIVER ASSOCIATES INC,DENVER,CO 80234",PLATTE RIVER ASSOCIATES INC,,,1997-07-01,WOS:A1997XL43600007,,

The overall objective of this investigation is to estimate the organic hydrocarbons in shallow sandy aquifers, released from continuous major point-source of pollution over a long period of time (91 years ago). This oil refinery contamination resulted mainly in the improper disposal of hydrocarbons and produced water releases caused by equipment failures, vandalism, and accidents that caused direct groundwater pollution or discharge into the gulf. In order to determine the fate of hydrocarbons, detailed field investigations were made to provide intensive deep profile information. Eight composite randomly sediment samples from a test plot were selected for demonstration. The tested plot was 50 m long x 50 m wide x 70 cm deep. Sediment samples were collected using an American auger around the point 29A degrees 57' 33aEuro(3) N and 32A degrees 30' 40aEuro(3) E in 2012 and covered an area of 2,500 m(2) which represents nearly 1/15 of total plant area (the total area of the plant is approximately 3.250 km(2)).

PW is generated in large amounts and has a complex composition, containing various toxic organic and inorganic compounds. PW is currently treated in conventional trains that include phase separators, decanters, cyclones and coarse filters in order to comply with existing regulation for discharge. These treatment trains do not achieve more restrictive limitations related to the reuse of the effluent (reinjection into extraction wells) or other beneficial uses (e.g., irrigation). Therefore, and to prevent environmental pollution, further polishing processes need to be carried out. Characterization of the PW to determine major constituents is the first step to select the optimum treatment for PW, coupled with environmental factors, economic considerations, and local regulatory framework. This review tries to provide an overview of different treatments that are being applied to polish this type of effluents. These technologies include membranes, physical, biological, thermal or chemical treatments, where special emphasis has been made on advanced oxidation processes due to the advantages offered by these processes. Commercial treatments, based on the combination, modification and improvement of simpler treatments, were also discussed. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

In-stream tidal power, a type of marine hydrokinetic (MHK) energy uses tidal currents to generate electricity and is one example of developing a renewable energy industry. Effects and impacts on fishes in areas of tidal power development are a consideration, and presently there are many unanswered questions in this field of research. Knowledge of how fish use these areas before and after device installation is essential to informing regulators for decision-making. We attempted a Before-After-Control-Impact (BACI) study design to compare an index of fish density near and away from an MHK tidal energy device deployed in Cobscook Bay, Maine. The index was mean volume backscattering strength (S-v) obtained from 24-hour stationary, down-looking hydroacoustic surveys. Data were collected several times per year at an impact site within 50-75 m of a device and at a control site approximately 1.6 km away, both before and after turbine installation in August 2012. Fish density was lowest in March surveys and highest in May surveys at both sites. One of four comparisons (August 2011/before vs. 2012/after) indicated an interaction of fish density with turbine installation. Operational status of the installed turbine and on-water activity disturbances (e.g., industry vessel and diving activities) varied at the impact site and possibly influenced results. Lower fish densities were observed during installation and maintenance periods than during normal device operation. The effects of construction activities must be separated from the effects of a deployed device to effectively implement a statistically rigorous assessment that could separate the effects of these different activities.

CO2 emissions from biomass conversion processes can also be captured. If that is done, biomass energy with CO2 capture and storage (BECS) would become a technology that removes CO2 from the atmosphere and at the same time deliver CO2-neutral energy carriers (heat, electricity or hydrogen) to society. Here we present estimates of the costs and conversion efficiency of electricity, hydrogen and heat generation from fossil fuels and biomass with CO2 capture and storage. We then insert these technology characteristics into a global energy and transportation model (GET 5.0), and calculate costs of stabilizing atmospheric CO2 concentration at 350 and 450 ppm. We find that carbon capture and storage technologies applied to fossil fuels have the potential to reduce the cost of meeting the 350 ppm stabilisation targets by 50% compared to a case where these technologies are not available and by 80% when BECS is allowed. For the 450 ppm scenario, the reduction in costs is 40 and 42%, respectively. Thus, the difference in costs between cases where BECS technologies are allowed and where they are not is marginal for the 450 ppm stabilization target. It is for very low stabilization targets that negative emissions become warranted, and this makes BECS more valuable than in cases with higher stabilization targets. Systematic and stochastic sensitivity analysis is performed. Finally, BECS opens up the possibility to remove CO2 from the atmosphere. But this option should not be seen as an argument in favour of doing nothing about the climate problem now and then switching on this technology if climate change turns out to be a significant problem. It is not likely that BECS can be initiated sufficiently rapidly at a sufficient scale to follow this path to avoiding abrupt and serious climate changes if that would happen.",,,,,,,,,249,2,0,0,52,1,271,,,0165-0009,1573-1480,,,,,,,,,,"Chalmers Univ Technol, Dept Phys Resource Theory, SE-41296 Gothenburg, SwedenPrinceton Univ, Princeton Environm Inst, Princeton, NJ 08540 USAInt Inst Appl Syst Anal, A-2361 Laxenburg, Austria",,,,2006-01-01,WOS:000237646500004,,

When umbilicals are exposed to tension and bending, tension will be imposed in the individual elements. The magnitude of tension is governed by the overall tension and bending and also by the lay angles, placement in the cross section and the friction forces between the elements.Some friction coefficients may be found in literature, but not all material combinations, and not for the conditions inside an umbilical.A project was therefore initiated with the aim of developing a friction testing device capable of determining friction coefficients between all elements in environments that are representative for the conditions within an umbilical, i.e.: at various temperatures; in sinusoidal movements, like the bending movements in an umbilical; at representative contact pressures, speeds and temperatures; in various environments, like air and seawater; without crumpling soft elements like synthetic tapes.",,,,,"31st ASME International Conference on Ocean, Offshore and Arctic Engineering31st ASME International Conference on Ocean, Offshore and Arctic Engineering","JUL 01-06, 2012JUL 01-06, 2012","Petrobras; ASME, Ocean Offshore & Arct Engn DivPetrobras; ASME, Ocean Offshore & Arct Engn Div","Rio de Janeiro, BRAZILRio de Janeiro, BRAZIL",3,0,0,0,0,0,3,,,,,978-0-7918-4490-8,,,,,,,,,"Nexans Norway AS, N-1751 Halden, Norway",,,,2013-11-05,WOS:000324565500009,,

Initial drainage networks formed within structurally defined valleys, and early deposition occurred in localized alluvial to shallow-marine depositional systems. Base-level-controlled depositional cycles aggraded the valleys; thus, as valleys aggraded, they buried interfluves and coalesced forming broad alluvial and coastal plains.Three to seven bedsets of variable net-to-gross content constitute a genetic cycle. Depositional cycles varied locally, as nine and eight cycles separated by decimeter- to multi-meter-thick mudstones are defined at Verknechonskoye and Yaraktinskoye, respectively. Within one genetic cycle, facies associations grade basinward from alluvial (channel-bar, channel-fill, floodplain, playa, and crevasse-splay) to shallow marine (sabkha, tidal-flat, estuarine-channel, and poorly developed shoreface). Coarse-grained lithofacies are typically arranged in decimeter- to meter-scale bedsets with sharp to scoured bases. Bedsets commonly, but not always, show an upward decrease in grain size, bed thickness, and scale of sedimentary structure. Typically, medium-grained sandstones exhibit low-angle cross bedding and are gradationally overlain by fine-grained sandstones exhibiting scour-and-fill, cuspate-ripple lamination, climbing-ripple lamination, and parallel lamination. Clay clasts and small pebbles are accessories. Interbedded mudstones, siltstones, and sandstones show ripple cross bedding, wavy to lenticular bedding, abundant soft-sediment deformation (e.g., shear, fluid-escape, slump features), and slickensides. Thin-bedded sandstones are micaceous and contain granule-size mud chips. Some mudstones exhibit crinkled to parallel laminae indicative of algal growth. Sandstone fills mudcracks. Interbedded green and black mudstones, plus pyrite and siderite cements, indicate alternating redox conditions. Alluvial facies have patchy quartz, anhydrite, and carbonate cements. Marine-influenced facies show early and well-developed quartz cement as well as abundant halite. Gypsum and halite dissolution formed secondary pores. Calculated estimates of fluvial-channel dimensions and sinuosities indicate that despite the lack of vegetation, fluvial channels in the Yarakta Horizon were shallow and relatively narrow, moderately sinuous, and exhibited varying degrees of mud-prone overbank deposition.Recognition and correlation of flooding surfaces and channel diastems bounding genetically related strata identified multiple stratigraphic compartments in each field. Porosity loss at chronostratigraphic boundaries accounts for complex water, oil, and gas contacts. Economic field development is hampered by locally varying reservoir quality and sandstone continuity caused by its channelized and onlapping stratigraphy and diagenesis. Reservoir simulation of varying geostatistical models demonstrate that differing porosity-distribution methods had little effect on estimates of in-place hydrocarbon volumes. Model differences in porosity and permeability distribution and lithofacies connectivity show large variations in recovery factor and productivity/injectivity.",,,,,,,,,2,0,0,0,0,0,2,,,1527-1404,1938-3681,,,,,,,,,,"DeGolyer & MacNaughton, 5001 Spring Valley Rd,Suite 800, East Dallas, TX 75244 USAStanford Univ, Dept Geol Sci, 450 Serra Mall, Stanford, CA 94305 USA",DeGolyer & MacNaughton,,,2020-02-28,WOS:000512929300004,,

The aim of this study was to develop a plant-wide control structure or strategy that can sustain the economic efficiency of the MSMR process. The NGL recovery and liquefaction units were integrated in the MSMR process to provide a compact plant structure with an efficient operation. Steady-state optimality analysis was intensively conducted in a rigorous dynamic simulation environment to determine the correct variable to sustain the economic efficiency of MSMR process. The results showed that the flow rate ratio of heavy and light mixed refrigerant (HK/LK ratio) is a promising self-optimizing controlled variable. Controlling this variable can sustain the MSMR optimality, even when the process is operated under off-design operating conditions or in the presence of disturbances. Based on the control structure tests, the control configuration with the HK/LK ratio loop showed excellent performance, maintaining the process stability against a range of disturbances. The proposed approach can also be applied to any cryogenic liquefaction technology for determining a possible optimizing controlled variable. (C) 2013 The Institution of Chemical Engineers.

The area covered by the permission allocated to the Hellenic Mission by the SCA of Egypt extends for 14 km east of the promontory of Silsileh (ancient Cape Lochias) to the peninsula of Montazah (ancient Small Taposiris). The survey focused on five sites that were detected by preliminary dives and with the use of a side-scan sonar device. Site # 1, at Chatby, revealed an important number of architectural elements made of granite, each weighing several tons. It is obvious that the archaeologists-divers are working on part of the submerged Royal Quarters where among other buildings there was in Ptolemaic times a palace, a sanctuary of Isis and the Mausoleum of Cleopatra. Site # 2, at Chatby, has revealed in the shallows human-made structures which have not yet been identified. This coastal zone is in the vicinity of the Martyrium of St. Mark. In Site 9 3, at lbrahimieh, at 9 to 12 metres' depth and at 560 metres' distance from the coast, a reef has been located with 58 stone-anchors of different types and sizes. Some are of the known variety of the three-hole composite anchors, while others can be classified as fishing tackles. This can be considered as one of the most important underwater archaeological sites with stone-anchors, because of the density and the diversity of the finds. On that same reef, a very large lead stock, weighing some 300 kg, with the lead assembly collar of a gigantic anchor was found. This is datable to the 1(st) century BC - 1(st) century AD. In the shallows of lbrahimieh, where is situated Site # 4, a very extended stone quarry, today submerged, has been discovered. It is believed that the stones used to build the ancient walls of Alexandria, which were bordering this location, were extracted from that quarry. A number of schist tombs were also located within the cavities resulting from stone extraction. Site # 5, at Sporting, revealed at only 3 metres' depth a very large complex of rectangular and semi-circular structures, which are submerged today and the use of which is still to be investigated.

While flexible risers are subjected to the same random environmental loads, probabilistic methods have yet to be applied in any meaningful way to the common limit states examined by the design community.Flexible riser systems offer operators a robust method of producing oil and gas fields in harsh environments. Systems are currently designed using a mixture of local and international standards such that they can withstand conditions with a sufficient margin of safety. Extreme dynamic analyses using proprietary finite element analysis (FEA) codes are performed using a deterministic load case matrix to define the extreme loading on the riser system. The loads are used to iterate the riser configuration / cross-section design to a fit-for-purpose solution and to define ancillary equipment, such as bend stiffeners, bend stiffener connectors, buoyancy modules and riser clamps.Individual load cases (LC) are defined by combining a number of parameters in order to represent different weather events and associated vessel responses in certain operating and accidental conditions, known as engineering events. LC matrices are then defined based on all combinations of weather and engineering events. However, the likelihood of the weather event or the engineering event occurring is currently not assessed.In the existing deterministic approach, all cases are run through the FEA model to validate the design criteria. However, increases in computing power have allowed load case matrices to expand by orders of magnitude as more variables and environmental conditions are considered. This has resulted in a large increase in engineering costs and capital expenditure through potentially over-designed solutions.This paper will demonstrate a new probabilistic screening assessment for developing a LC matrix for the dynamic analysis of flexible risers. Specifically, the combined wave and current loads on the flexible riser system in service are examined to determine the probability of occurrence of the weather event. ISO 13628-2 [1] currently states that load cases with a frequency of 1 in 10,000 years are non-credible for design purpose and can be ignored. The field metocean data including directional sea states and likelihoods are used to confirm which weather events meet this criteria, screening out those which are non-credible. This screening reduces significantly the number of load combinations while validating a fit for purpose design. The correlation of environmental loads generated by wind, wave and currents is a complex topic, nevertheless, it is incorporated conservatively in the screening method developed in this study.An example is shown for the West-of-Shetland quadrant, where the methodology is applied to a designed riser system. The screening methodology shows 70% of the load cases have non-credible probabilities of occurrence of less than 2.0E-03 over 20 years (lower than one in 10,000 year annual frequency). The example also shows that the load cases which governed the design present a lower probability of occurrence than specified by the industry standards. The methodology removes complexity from the engineering system which could be directly converted into manufacturing and installation cost-savings.",,,,,"36th ASME International Conference on Ocean, Offshore and Arctic Engineering36th ASME International Conference on Ocean, Offshore and Arctic Engineering","JUN 25-30, 2017JUN 25-30, 2017","ASME, Ocean Offshore & Arctic Engn DivASME, Ocean Offshore & Arctic Engn Div","Trondheim, NORWAYTrondheim, NORWAY",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,978-0-7918-5769-4,,,,,,,,,"Genesis, Aberdeen, ScotlandTechnipFMC, Rueil Malmaison, FranceTechnipFMC, Aberdeen, Scotland",GenesisTechnipFMCTechnipFMC,,,2017-12-27,WOS:000417224900013,,

In the initial phase of the risk assessment, the effect of various scenario parameters on the annual probability of gas explosion was quantified via a MATLAB code. For calculating the gas explosion frequency, the hydrocarbon leak frequencies and the ignition probabilities were derived from the HCR (HydroCarbon Release) database from the Health & Safety Executive (HSE, UK), and the IP (Ignition Probability) report from UKOOA (UK Offshore Operators Association), respectively. The MATLAB code has the algorithm to cope with the varying design practice in either Front End Engineering Design phase or detailed design phase. User-definable parameter setup and spreadsheet data input provide the user with the flexibility in selecting relevant level of elaboration for such design parameters as the leak size distribution, the hydrocarbon composition, etc. These features of the code enable controlling the number of explosion scenarios without any parameter range remaining unaccounted for. The present MATLAB code has been applied to generate hydrocarbon leak scenarios and corresponding explosion probability for the topside process modules of a specific oil Floating Production, Storage and Offloading. Varying the number of cases for each parameter leads to the variation of the number of explosion scenarios selected, which are either 48 or 24 in the particular case. For each explosion scenario, the gas leak and explosion simulation was carried out using the FLame Acceleration Simulator (FLACS) commercial S/W package, giving rise to the annual probability of exceedance for the explosion overpressure. Discussion of the influence of explosion scenario selection method on the change of the overpressure exceedance curves is made.

With increasing effects of climate change and finite fossil fuels, clean renewable energy must be utilised. Both wind and solar technologies are mature enough to be cost competitive, however, marine energy (tidal and wave technologies) - specifically tidal - is presently at the pre-commercial stage1. Tidal power is both energy dense and predictable, though it is spatially limited, relative geographic constrictions are required.One major challenge for tidal power progression at present is the lack of knowledge of tidal flow at high energy sites, this contributes to over engineering TECs which directly correspond to large expenses in both construction and levelised cost of energy (LCOE) - price of electricity is not sufficient to generate returns on investments2 . TECs currently replicate the wind industry, though operation conditions are dissimilar. Factors such as: boundary layer, bathymetry, coastline geometries and additional complications are experienced through the interaction between wave and currents throughout the water column.Site characterisations (required before deployment of TEC) utilise Acoustic Doppler Current Profilers (ADCPs), these devices collect data corresponding to tidal flow, direction and turbulence factors, different variations allow for longer ranges and depths with differing resolutions to be analysed. ADCPs are the most practical and economical instruments for obtaining instantaneous velocity profile measurements3. These data sets are expensive to acquire and only provide information from a single location. They are typically used to calibrate and validate wide-region numerical models which can provide more site-wide information.ADCPs come with uncertainties such as: random error; calibration; resolution error; device placement & orientation; temperature sensor and data acquisition. Currently, standards exist for determining uncertainties in calibrated instruments and measured results, these are part of the technical specification IEC 62600-200:20134, power performance assessment (PPA). These are largely based on the wind standard IEC 61400-12 PPA5, and there is a need to demonstrate the suitability of these specifically to tidal energy.The project will be carried out in collaboration with an industrial partner, EMEC and external relationships may be formed with developers throughout the project. Three universities will provide supervision (Edinburgh, Strathclyde and Exeter). The focus is to develop the IEC 62600-200 PPA in relation to uncertainty of results for the power curve. Real-time data processing of instruments will be analysed, exploring solutions to issues found with battery power or cable connection.

The observer consists of a copy of the plant plus output injection terms where the gain is computed analytically in terms of the Bessel function of the first kind.

Thereby the interest in the research of Paleozoic deposits and weathering profile oil is topical both in the context of their genesis verifying and the stocks growing of the already exploited areas. The molecular composition of eight samples of Paleozoic oil was studied in details: Gerasimovskaya (Well 18), Kalinovaya (Wells 10 and 21), Urmanskaya (Wells 10 and 11), North Ostaninskaya (Well 5), Maloichskaya (Well 6), Palyanovskaya (Well 10). The sampling interval is 2818-3130 m. Hydrocarbons (HC) extraction was carried out using adsorption chromatography with aluminum of IV-th activity level. Hexane was used as a solvent. The detailed analysis of the component composition was released using Thermo Scientific magnetic chromatography-mass spectrometer DFS. Normal alkanes dominate among aliphatic hydrocarbons. The composition of alkanes in the studied oil samples shows a widespread development of phytoplankton in the water column and reducing conditions during source rock deposition. The relative abundance of alkylbenzenes in the hexane fraction of the studied samples varies from 1.58% in the North Ostaninskaya to 6.42% in Kalinovaya (Well 10). Compounds with one alkylsubstituent, mono-, di-, and trimethylalkylbenzenes (TMAB) were also identified. TMAB, arilisoprenoids with the alkyl chain from C6 to C11 long having an isoprenoid structure, were fixed in different concentrations in most samples, except the North Ostaninskaya and Urmanskaya (Well 11). All investigated samples of Paleozoic oil are characterized by low content of C17 homologue in TMAB distribution. Its low abundance is connected with the isoprenoid chain structure of arilisoprenoid biological precursors -aromatic carotenoids of isorenieraten and beta-isorenieraten. The presence of arilisoprenoids in oil proves that the organic matter accumulation took place in the photic zone of the euxinic basin. According to the data on steranes and hopanes composition the organic matter was deposited in an open and shallow sea with normal salinity. The thermal maturity of the studied oil samples is confirmed by the steranes, hopanes, sekohopanes and n-alkanes composition. Thereby, the current study of Paleozoic oil biomarkers from the southeast of Western Siberia gives a possibility to conclude that the accumulation of the organic matter which produced a big part of oil took place in the littoral protoxidic conditions with normal salinity. Sea algae had the main impact in the organic matter formation. According to the steranes, hopanes, sekogopanes and n-alkanes composition the studied oil samples are thermally mature.",,,,,,,,,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,,,1561-7793,1561-803X,,,,,,,,,,"SB RAS, Inst Petr Chem, Tomsk, Russia",,,,2014-05-01,WOS:000420996800032,,

The controller for the heave disturbance attenuation consists of three cascaded parts. First, a nonlinear inversion element is applied to invert nonlinearity of choke. Second, an adaptive compensator is designed based on internal model, and certainty equivalence principles for asymptotic rejection of time-varying heave disturbance. Third, an output feedback controller is synthesized for providing stability and improving transient performance of closed-loop system. Robust stability of closed-loop system is analyzed using edge theorem. Simulation results of the combined adaptive output regulator are presented, which show satisfactory set-point tracking and attenuation of the heave disturbance.

Many developed nations have long-standing programmes to eradicate tuberculosis in livestock, principally cattle. As disease prevalence in cattle decreases these efforts are sometimes impeded by passage of M.bovis from wildlife to cattle. In epidemiological terms, disease can persist in some wildlife species, creating disease reservoirs, if the basic reproduction rate (R-0) and critical community size (CCS) thresholds are achieved. Recognized wildlife reservoir hosts of M.bovis include the brushtail possum (Trichosurus vulpecula) in New Zealand, European badger (Meles meles) in Great Britain and Ireland, African buffalo (Syncerus caffer) in South Africa, wild boar (Sus scrofa) in the Iberian Peninsula and white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) in Michigan, USA. The epidemiological concepts of R-0 and CCS are related to more tangible disease/pathogen characteristics such as prevalence, pathogen-induced pathology, host behaviour and ecology. An understanding of both epidemiological and disease/pathogen characteristics is necessary to identify wildlife reservoirs of M.bovis. In some cases, there is a single wildlife reservoir host involved in transmission of M.bovis to cattle. Complexity increases, however, in multihost systems where multiple potential reservoir hosts exist. Bovine tuberculosis eradication efforts require elimination of M.bovis transmission between wildlife reservoirs and cattle. For successful eradication identification of true wildlife reservoirs is critical, as disease control efforts are most effective when directed towards true reservoirs.",,,,,,,,,109,1,0,0,73,1,120,,,1865-1674,1865-1682,,,,,,,,,,"ARS, Bacterial Dis Livestock Res Unit, Natl Anim Dis Ctr, USDA, Ames, IA 50010 USA",,,,2013-11-01,WOS:000326333600002,24171844,

Such information could help to direct land management for the purpose of carbon sequestration. Soils were sampled under different land covers and at different topographic positions on the mostly forested 14,000 ha Oak Ridge Reservation in Tennessee, USA. Most of the soil carbon stock, to a 40-cm soil depth, was found to reside in the surface 20 cm of mineral soil. Surface soil carbon and nitrogen stocks were partitioned into particulate ( greater than or equal to 53 mum) and mineral-associated organic matter (< 53 μm). Generally, soils under pasture had greater nitrogen availability, greater carbon and nitrogen stocks, and lower C: N ratios than soils under transitional vegetation and forests. The effects of topography were usually secondary to those of land cover. Because of greater soil carbon stocks, and greater allocation of soil carbon to mineral-associated organic matter (a long-term pool), we conclude that soil carbon sequestration, but not necessarily total ecosystem carbon storage, is greater under pastures than under forests. The implications of landscape-level variation in soil carbon and nitrogen for carbon sequestration are discussed at several different levels: (1) nitrogen limitations to soil carbon storage; (2) controls on soil carbon turnover as a result of litter chemistry and soil carbon partitioning; (3) residual effects of past land use history; and (4) statistical limitations to the quantification of soil carbon stocks.",,,,,,,,,46,1,0,0,31,0,52,,,0886-6236,,,,,,,,,,,"Oak Ridge Natl Lab, Div Environm Sci, Oak Ridge, TN 37831 USA",,,,2002-12-05,WOS:000181062500004,,

The diesel route comprises of a shift from heavy fuel oil to marine gas oil and then a gradual shift to biodiesel, whereas the gas route comprises of a shift to liquefied natural gas and then a gradual shift to liquefied biogas. The two routes are assessed in a case study for the ferry traffic between the Swedish mainland and the island Gotland. Life cycle assessment (LCA) is used to evaluate the environmental performance with the functional unit chosen to be one year of ro-pax ferry service, including both passenger and goods transportation. The gas route is indicated to have better overall environmental performance than the diesel route. Furthermore, use of biofuels is illustrated as one possible measure to decrease the global warming impact from shipping, but to the expense of greater environmental impact for some other impact categories. As an example, the global warming potential (GWP(100)) was shown to decrease with the use of biofuels in this study, while the eutrophication potential and the primary energy use increased.

Here, a combination of chemical fingerprinting of surface oils, tissue residue analysis, and biological effects measures was used to explore the relationship between spilled oil and biological impact following the grounding of the MSC Napoli container ship in Lyme Bay, England in January 2007. Initially, oil contamination remained restricted to a surface slick in the vicinity of the wreck, and there was no chemical evidence to link biological impairment of animals (the common limpet, Patella Niigata) on the shore adjacent to the oil spill. Secondary oil contamination associated with salvage activities in July 2007 was also assessed. Chemical analyses of aliphatic hydrocarbons and terpanes in shell swabs taken from limpet shells provided an unequivocal match with the fuel oil carried by the ship. Corresponding chemical analysis of limpet tissues revealed increased concentrations of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) dominated by phenanthrene and Cl to C3 phenanthrenes with smaller contributions from heavier molecular weight PAL-Is. Concurrent ecotoxicological tests indicated impairment of cellular viability (p < 0.001). reduced immune function (p < 0.001). and damage to DNA (Comet assay, p < 0.001) in these animals, whereas antioxidant defenses were elevated relative to un-oiled animals.

Considering the chemotaxis of bacteria, they migrate towards a better way to survive. However, the information concerning the chemotactic biosorption of microorganism is severely limited thus far. Therefore, chemotactic biosorption a novel way of sorption was put forward. The equation was defined as: A (chemotactic) (biosorption) = A (extracellular biosorption) - A (passive extracellular biosorption) + E (intracellular). Effects of controlling parameters like pollutant, fertilizer, sediments and surfactant on bacterial chemotactic sorption capacity of tetradecane, hexadecane, phenanthrene or pyrene were described in detail. The results showed bacterial chemotactic biosorption would be promoted under the conditions of low pollutant concentration, high sediment concentration and fertilizer. However, Tween 80 would promote the sorption of pollutants onto bacterial cells depending on the concentration of surfactant. Correlational analyses were conducted with the biodegradation rate and the concentration (mg/g) of hydrocarbons measured in the biomass. We concluded there existed great correlation between them. Biodegradation rate were all linearly correlated with the concentration (mg/g) of hydrocarbons measured in the biomass in all respects with tetradecane (R-2 = 0.9873), hexadecane (R-2 = 0.9705), phenanthrene (R-2 = 0.9098) and pyrene (R-2 = 0.9424).

Projections of POC export can also be quantified using an alternative physiologically-based approach, the Metabolic Theory of Ecology (MTE). MTE employs an activation energy (E-a) describing organismal metabolic sensitivity to temperature change, but does not consider changes in ocean chemistry or physics. Many ESMs incorporate temperature dependent functions, where rates (e.g., respiration) scale with temperature. Temperature sensitivity describes how temperature dependence varies across metabolic rates or species. ESMs acknowledge temperature sensitivity between rates (e.g., between heterotrophic and autotropic processes), but due to a lack of empirical data cannot parameterize for variation within rates, such as differences within species or biogeochemical provinces. Here we investigate how varying temperature sensitivity affects heterotrophic microbial respiration and hence future POC export. Using satellite-derived data and ESM temperature projections we applied microbial MTE, with varying temperature sensitivity, to estimates of global POC export. In line with observations from polar regions and the deep ocean we imposed an elevated temperature sensitivity (E-a = 1.0 eV) to cooler regions; firstly to the Southern Ocean (south of 40 degrees S) and secondly where temperature at 100 m depth < 13 degrees C. Elsewhere in both these scenarios Ea was set to 0.7 eV (moderate sensitivity/classic MTE). Imposing high temperature sensitivity in cool regions resulted in projected declines in export of 17 +/- 1% (< 40 degrees S) and 23 +/- 1% (< 13 degrees C) by 2100 relative to the present day. Hence varying microbial temperature sensitivity resulted in at least 2-fold greater declines in POC export than suggested by classic MTE derived in this study (12 +/- 1%, E-a = 0.7 eV globally) or ESMs (1-12%). The sparse observational data currently available suggests metabolic temperature sensitivity of organisms likely differs depending on the oceanic province they reside in. We advocate temperature sensitivity to be incorporated in biogeochemical models to improve projections of future carbon export, which could be currently underestimating the change in future POC export.",,,,,,,,,15,0,0,0,11,0,15,,,2296-701X,,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Tasmania, Inst Marine & Antarctic Studies, Hobart, Tas, AustraliaNatl Oceanog Ctr, Southampton, Hants, EnglandUniv Tasmania, Antarctic Climate & Ecosyst CRC, Hobart, Tas, Australia",,,,2019-05-27,WOS:000467376200002,,

This paper proposes the idea of implementing an Integrated Energy System (IES) with UHS and other hydrogen related technologies, called Hydrogen Penetrated Energy System (HPES), and presents an intelligent planning procedure applicable to the HPES. Depleted oil/gas fields and salt caverns are selected as the study objects to explore the ability of UHS to achieve seasonal peak shaving, facilitate the renewable energy, and improve the energy system efficiency. Firstly, three regions in China are analysed in terms of geological conditions, resource endowment and load characteristics, to illustrate the feasibility of building a HPES in each of the analysed region. A two-stage planning method for the HPES is proposed and a detailed UHS model is established where the process of cushion gas accumulation is emulated and the influence of the diurnal temperature range is considered. Comprehensive case studies are subsequently carried out for typical cities or regions in Eastern, Northern and North-eastern China and the results demonstrate that the HPES can lower the cost, improve the energy efficiency and reduce the level of carbon dioxide emission to some extent. A lateral comparison also shows that the combination of salt cavern UHS and offshore wind power has a broad application prospect in the east coast of China, and the investment in the HPES scheme for Jintan can be recovered within 8 to 9 years. In addition, compared with the benchmark scheme without UHS and large penetration of renewables, the HPES scheme for Jintan can improve the primary energy efficiency by 22.26% and 27.75% in the first decade and second decade, reduce the carbon dioxide emission by more than 96%, and consume an average level of 95.85% of the offshore wind power.

This paper examines VT and CP data for tonnes of cane per hectare (TCH) and sugar content (CCS). Data, analysed by REML, included 107 VTs and 54 CP mill years for 9 varieties from the mill districts of Mulgrave, Babinda, and Tully for harvest years 1982-99. Important consistencies included high TCH of Q152, high CCS of Q117 and Q120, and low CCS of H56-752. Significant anomalies existed with respect to TCH for Q113, Q117, Q120, Q122, Q138, and H56-752 and to CCS for Q113 and Q124. Investigation of these anomalies was assisted by access to independent REML analyses of CP data for 65692 individual Tully cane blocks from 1988 to 1999 and by the knowledge of persons familiar with the preferential uses of varieties by farmers. Minor anomalies were due to limited year or mill area data. Q124 TCH was deemed to be decreased and its CCS increased by severe disease in Babinda CP in the extremely wet 1998 and 1999 seasons. Other serious anomalies have credible but unsubstantiated explanations. The most convincing, for Q113, Q117, Q138, and H56-752, are that these varieties were deployed unevenly with regard to late season harvesting, predominant use or avoidance on high fertility soils, or use confined to low fertility sandy soils, respectively. Uneven deployment results in confounding of these effects in the varietal CP statistics at mill area level. It is concluded that VTs cannot be enhanced to anticipate or evaluate most effects of uneven deployment. They give adequate predictions of relative CP performance for varieties deployed evenly across confounding influences.

The present scenario comprehends offshore processing of high flow rate of high-pressure natural gas with 68%mol carbon dioxide, which results from oil production and behaves as a dense supercritical fluid. The processing goals with this fluid comprise: [A] water dew-point adjustment; [B] hydrocarbon dew-point adjustment; [C] decarbonation of a small part to 20%mol carbon dioxide fuel-gas for power production; and [D] compression/pumping of the remaining fluid enriched with carbon dioxide from decarbonation for enhanced oil recovery. For these tasks the industry considers traditional well established processes such as molecular-sieves adsorption for water dew-point adjustment, Joule-Thompson expansion for hydrocarbon dew-point adjustment and membrane-permeation for carbon dioxide removal. However, conventional technologies can become cumbersome in such awkward conditions. Thus, unconventional solutions are sought for reliability, lower equipment size/weight, and better power consumption, emissions and environmental sustainability. Recently, supersonic separators have been analyzed in proof-of-concept researches for natural gas processing. In this regard, this work quantitatively proves that goals [A],[B],[C] are achievable using only supersonic separators, attaining 33% higher net value, 40% greater oil production, 10% lower investment and economic leverage to reach lower carbon emission relatively to conventional counterparts.

We present a methodology for evaluating the sustainability of a region's electric generation portfolio, using multi-criteria decision analysis. Our framework focuses on long-term capacity planning for resource adequacy and sustainability. We used a regional electricity model and pay close attention to controversies involving offshore wind, natural gas pipelines, and the retirement of nuclear plants. We evaluate a set of generation portfolios under nine illustrative stakeholder preference scenarios across seven sustainability metrics. We find that under many stakeholder preferences, increasing offshore wind from 1.6 to 10 GW and eliminating oil generation scores well. If stakeholders are concerned about the full range of sustainability metrics - including costs, climate change, pollution, land-use, jobs, and safety alongside water conservation and nuclear concerns - then the most sustainable solution is to increase nuclear (to 9.2 GW from 3.5) alongside wind, and back them up with base levels of natural gas and hydro (18.7 and 3.3 GW respectively).",,,,,,,,,29,0,0,0,2,0,29,,,0306-2619,1872-9118,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Massachusetts Amherst, Amherst, MA 01003 USA",,,,2019-07-09,WOS:000470045800052,,
J,,,,,,,,,,,Using cold adapted photobionts to improve photosynthesis in economically important organisms,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Awarded Grant,Sep 22 2019,2019,"It is predicted that global population numbers will rise to 9.6 billion by the year 2050 (Bradshaw and Brook, 2014). This coupled with the rise of average global temperatures and climatic change poses a significant risk to global food security. Current agricultural practices in many parts of the world are archaic demonstrating the potential for optimisation; preventing significant deforestation and increasing water use efficiency. One solution for optimisation can be through the application of genetic engineering.An area of plant biochemistry that has been highlighted as a significant bottle neck in plant productivity and therefore in need of optimisation, is the activity of Rubisco. This is the enzyme that acts as the primary catalyst for CO2 fixation in photosynthetic organisms. As a result Rubisco is the most abundant protein on earth with 5kg of Rubisco for every human (Phillips and Milo, 2009). However it is both inefficient in terms of catalytic rate and specificity. It evolved in a CO2 rich atmosphere 3.5 billion years ago, where specificity was not a requirement (Bracher et al., 2017). This was proceeded by two great oxygenation events in earth's history which necessitated the rapidevolution of Rubisco, increasing specificity for CO2 relative to O2 (Erb and Zarzycki, 2018). None the less, specificity remains an inefficiency in Rubisco action as the enzyme will frequently catalyse the binding of oxygen with RuBP. This leads to the formation of 3-phosphoglycerate (3-PGA) and 2-phosphoglycolate (2-PG) of which 2-PG is toxic to the plant. Therefore it must undergo a highly energetic metabolic process through the chloroplast, peroxisomes and mitochondria to recycle RuBP from 2-PG. Alternatively binding of CO2 with RuBP, catalysed by Rubisco, results in the formation of two 3-PGA molecules; products that can be used to synthesise further sugars for growth (Bracher et al., 2017). The two components of Rubisco kinetics are often interlinked leading to a trade-off between specificity and catalytic rate with an increase in one negatively impacting the other.In contrast, within high latitude marine environments concentrations of CO2 increase relative to O2 due to differing absorption kinetics. This coupled with the presence of a carbon capture mechanism (CCM), found in many marine photoautotrophs is hypothesised to remove the stringent requirement for Rubisco specificity. This in turn would give rise to higher than expected catalytic rates at low temperatures (catalytic rate falls exponentially with decreasing temperature) (Feller and Gerday, 2003). Therefore investigating this relatively understudied clade of cold adapted marine organisms, largely consisting of algae species, may give rise to potentially novel and beneficial variations of Rubisco. A concept that can be bioengineered into economically important crops. This will be achieved primarily through the following steps:1. Collection and CultureThis study will initially require the culturing of psychrophilic algal strains obtained from culture banks and raw glacial samples. 2. SequencingThis will be followed by the subsequent sequencing of the Rubisco genes to determine the degree of genetic variation of the algal Rubisco from other temperate organisms.3. Kinetic assaysSequencing will be performed in conjunction with kinetic assays and high throughput Rubisco quantification. This should elucidate to the evolutionary mechanism that allows polar algal populations to assimilate carbon efficiently.4. UpscaleAlgal bioreactors are a constituent part of industry. Psychrophilic algae have great potential for biotechnological application, with enzymes being active at low temperatures. Therefore the final step of the study is to optimise media and hardware to culture biologically interesting strains on a large scale.

This mitigation alternative includes the capture of CO2, its transportation to the location of use and injection. The fermentation of ethanol produces a high concentration stream of CO2 and therefore has a low cost of capture. The technical feasibility analysis demonstrates the potential to use approximately 80% of the CO2 that is emitted by the distilleries. The abatement costs vary with the costs of dehydration, compression and injection of CO2 and with the type of investor in the CO2-EOR infrastructure, which could be an oil company or a set of distilleries. When an oil company invests in the EOR infrastructure, the average abatement cost is approximately US$ 200 per tonne of CO2. When distilleries are the investors, the average abatement cost is approximately US$ 350 per tonne of CO2. This disparity is because the revenue from selling the oil that is produced by EOR is much higher than the revenue from selling the CO2 at the wellhead. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

For reasons of prestige and financial profit, state control was kept over the convoys sent in this direction, yet enough room was left for private trading initiative as well. Thanks to the experience gained and for the purpose of facilitating the sailing itself, a whole set of cartographic products and portolan charts with descriptions of shores, harbours, anchorages, and sea characteristics were developed. The principal feature of those maps was that they did not include the shores southward of the Canary Islands, Cape Bojador, and the north shores of Scandinavia. Pietro Querini's voyage was described in two reports written by the surviving crew members. Their sailing ship set on the voyage from Crete on 30 April 1431, freighted with barrels of malmsey wine and other goods. The crew numbered around fifty seamen, among whom there were two Croatians one from Zadar, and the other from Sibenik. During the voyage, the ship passed the Gibraltar and was wrecked near Cadiz. The damage to the steering wheel decided the ship's further fate. After repair, the wind directed them to the Canary Islands, which caused fear among the crew. This was in line with the belief that all ships that sail behind Capes Non and Bojador would suffer a wreck. They however managed to return and, after passing Cape Finisterre, arrived to the Channel. They were caught in a sequence of storms, which destroyed their steering wheel and sails, and consequently arrived to a position approximately 1,000 km westward of Ireland. After leaving the ship, they embarked two smaller boats. One of them carried Querini and another 44 seamen; they set to the northeast under strong wind and the Gulf Stream. The majority died of cold, hunger and thirst, while only thirteen of them managed on 5 January 1432 - to disembark on Sancloy in the Lofoten Islands (in the north of Norway). The islanders of Rost rescued them and offered them hospitality, so that they recovered. The eleven men who had survived (the two from Zadar and Sibenik with them) set off on a journey home. They crossed Norway and Sweden on foot up to the harbour of Lodose. Ivan VI Frankopan, who was in service of King Erik VII at that time, offered them hospitality on the way. Querini and Croatian seamen continued to sail to England, and later to Flanders. They arrived in Venice on 12 October 1432. Though shipwrecks were rather frequent in that period, none of the other cases attracted as much attention as the case of Querini. It is interesting due to the fact that the ship had reached the ultimate borders of the world as known at that time the Canary Islands in the south, and the Lofoten Islands in the north; the voyage crossed 14,100 km in total. Additionally, as a result thereof, certain data were entered into cartographic products of later dates - for instance into the Mappamondo by friar Mauro of 1459. The seamen who survived were the first South Europeans who ate codfish. For us, it is of interest that two seamen from Croatian lands took part in the voyage and managed to survive all the hardships.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,1330-0474,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2017-03-22,WOS:000393939000002,,

Type A is characterized by intertidal slopes of time-constant steepness which advance/recede parallel to themselves in response to changing wave conditions. Type B is characterized by slopes of time-varying steepness which intersect at a given point in the intertidal area. This finding has a direct influence on the definition of oil depth. Type A pattern exhibits oil burial along the entire intertidal area following decreasing wave energy, while the type B pattern combines burial in high intertidal and exhumation in mid and/or low intertidal zones, depending on the position of the intersection point.

Furthermore, wired networks require a connection to some central, powered entity which is only available in a boat or on-shore. This is not ideal for deep- ocean or prolonged underwater operations. Wireless acoustics are suitable for low-bandwidth applications, but they are not able to form large networks as the channel capacity is relatively limited.

Decreasing the flow rate results in higher hydrate saturation, lower brine saturation, a smaller affected volume, and larger average pressure differentials across the sample. We interpret that the longer execution times at lower flow rates allow for additional methane transport and hydrate formation at the hydrate-brine interface. As a result, the hydrate skin is thicker at lower flow rates and thus is capable of sustaining larger pressure differentials. In several experiments, we stop brine flow and supply methane gas to the sample for an additional 800 hrs. During this period, hydrate continues to form, pressure differentials develop, and the bulk density changes within the affected volume. We interpret that there is gas present in the sample that is disconnected from the gas source. Hydrate forms around the disconnected gas due to methane transport through the skin that surrounds it, causing the internal gas pressure to decline and leading to inward collapse and net volume decrease. This lowers the brine pressure and creates a differential pressure across the sample that induces gas flow. This study indicates that lower gas flow rates through the hydrate stability zone can produce very high saturations of hydrate but require a larger differential pressure to sustain flow. Ultimately, this process is an alternative mechanism for sustained upward gas flow and hydrate formation far above the base of the hydrate stability zone.",,,,,,,,,12,0,0,0,0,0,12,,,2169-9313,2169-9356,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Texas Austin, Jackson Sch Geosci, Inst Geophys, Austin, TX 78712 USAUniv Texas Austin, Jackson Sch Geosci, Dept Geol Sci, Austin, TX 78712 USAUniv Texas Austin, Petr & Geosyst Engn, Austin, TX 78712 USA",,,,2018-10-16,WOS:000446170700007,,

This monitoring system is intended to provide real-time stereographic imagery in the near- field (< 10 m) of tidal turbines proposed for deployment in Admiralty Inlet, Puget Sound, Washington. Postdeployment observations will provide the necessary information about the frequency and type of interactions between marine animals and the turbine. A method for optimizing the stereo camera arrangement is given, along with a quantitative assessment of the system's ability to measure and track targets in three-dimensional space. Optical camera effectiveness is qualitatively evaluated under realistic field conditions to determine the range within which detection, discrimination, and classification of targets is possible. These field evaluations inform optimal system placement relative to the turbine rotor. Tests suggest that the stereographic cameras will likely be able to discriminate and classify targets at ranges up to 3.5 m and detect targets at ranges up to, and potentially beyond, 4.5 m. Future system testing will include the use of an imaging sonar (acoustical camera) to evaluate behavioral disturbances associated with artificial lighting.

In this study, we compared the toxicity of water accommodated fractions (WAFs) of naturally weathered crude oils, source oil, and source oil with dispersant mixtures and their effects on developing sheepshead minnow and zebrafish. Although a freshwater fish, zebrafish has been used as a model for marine oil spills owing to the molecular and genetic tools available and their amenability to lab care. Our study not only aimed to determine the effect of crude oil on early life stages of these two fish species, but also aimed to determine whether dissolved crude oil constituents were similar in fresh and saltwater, and if freshwater fish might be a suitable model to study marine spills. Weathering and dispersant had similar effects on WAF composition in both fresh and saltwater, except that the saltwater source oil + dispersant WAF had markedly higher PAH levels than the freshwater equivalent. WAF exposure differentially affected survival, as the LC50 values in %WAF for the zebrafish and sheepshead minnow exposures were 44.9% WAF (95% confidence interval (C.I.) 42.1-47.9) and 16.8% WAF (95% C.I. 13.7-20.5); respectively. Exposure increased heart rate of zebrafish embryos, whereas in sheepshead, source oil exposure had the opposite effect. WAF exposure altered mRNA expression of biotransformation makers, vitellogenin and neurodevelopment genes in both species. Muscle deformations were only found in oil-exposed zebrafish. This is one of the most comprehensive studies to date on crude oil toxicity, and highlights the species-specific differences in cardiotoxicity, estrogenic effects, biotransformation enzyme induction and potential neurotoxicity of crude oil exposure.

Owing to soil consolidation during the jack-up operational period and the intervening period before reinstallation, the interaction between a new spudcan installation and an existing footprint is complex and time dependent. This paper presents a series of drum centrifuge model tests to investigate the changes in the shear strength of soils beneath and adjacent to a spudcan footprint in normally and overconsolidated clays. The changes with time after two different jack-up operational periods are presented. The results reveal that the soil beneath a footprint generally loses some strength initially, owing to soil remoulding, but it subsequently regains its strength with time as it reconsolidates. The soil remoulding and subsequent strength gain are found to be more significant in normally consolidated clay than in overconsolidated clay. A longer jack-up operational period has an effect of strengthening the underlying soil below the spudcan in both clays. The vertical load, induced horizontal load and moment on a spudcan during its reinstallation into an existing footprint at different times after footprint formation are studied. Compared with the load for installing a spudcan for the first time, the load required to reinstall the same spudcan to the same depth is smaller in normally consolidated clay if the elapsed time between footprint formation and spudcan reinstallation is relatively short. The required load for spudcan reinstallation subsequently increases with footprint elapsed time. For overconsolidated clay, the load required for spudcan reinstallation is always smaller than that for initial spudcan installation, irrespective of the time between installations. The effects of original in situ soil strength, changes in soil strength with time and footprint elapsed time on the interaction between spudcan and footprint are examined.",,,,,,,,,36,4,0,0,0,0,38,,,0016-8505,1751-7656,,,,,,,,,,"Subsea 7 AS, Randaberg, NorwayNatl Univ Singapore, Ctr Offshore Res & Engn, Singapore 117548, SingaporeUniv Western Australia, Ctr Offshore Fdn Syst, Crawley, WA, Australia",Subsea 7 AS,,,2012-05-16,WOS:000303354500003,,

The TOEs and fractions were examined by gas chromatography (GC), GC-mass spectrometry (GC-MS), two dimensional GC-MS (GC x GC-MS) and liquid chromatography with high-resolution spectrometry (LC-HRMS) techniques.Low molecular weight aromatics, phenols and other common petroleum-derived hydrocarbons were characterized and quantified in the TOEs and fractions. In addition, a range of more uncommon polar and apolar constituents, including those likely derived from production chemicals, such as trithiolane, imidazolines and quaternary amine compounds (so-called 'quats'), were tentatively identified, using GC x GC-MS and LC-HRMS.The acute toxicity of the TOEs and subfractions was investigated using early life stages of the marine copepod Acartia tonsa. Toxicity varied significantly for different PW TOEs and subfractions. For some PWs, the toxicity was attributed mainly to the 'polar' components, while that of other PWs was associated mainly with the 'apolar' components. Importantly, the observed toxicity could not be explained by the presence of the commonly reported compounds only.Although, due to the vast chemical complexity even of the sub-fractions of the PW extracts, specific compounds driving the observed toxicity could be not be elucidated in this study, the proposed approach may suggest a way forward for future revisions of monitoring regimes for PW discharges.

The deliberate discharge by Iraqi soldiers of 6.3 million barrels of crude oil during the 1991 war against Kuwait in this region was an extreme act of environmental terrorism is an example to show that this region is at risk of pollution (Williams, 1991). The Arvanroud River, which is the biggest river discharges into the Persian Gulf, is the only navigable river located at the northwestern extremity of the Gulf. Many tanker ships transfer huge amount of oil from this river everyday.To study the contaminant dispersion from Arvandroud River into the Persian Gulf, a three-dimensional hydrodynamic model (COHERENS) has been employed.

In order to evaluate the potential of on-site identification, an assemblage of 13 ceramic shards recently excavated from the medieval port site of Qalhdt (Omani coast) assigned to Vietnamese and/or southern Chinese productions by using stylistic/visual criteria has been qualitatively analysed with a portable X-ray fluorescence instrument and a transportable Raman spectrometer and compared with data recorded on a large variety of reference shards excavated from different kiln places of the Hong River bank, Central Viet Nam, and from the Cu Lao Cham shipwreck. In the glaze/body, the zirconium, rubidium and titanium contents allow distinguishing between Vietnamese and Chinese ancient/modern productions. The potassium vs. calcium glaze content is also very efficient for the differentiation between the Chinese and Vietnamese origins. Measurements confirm 80% of the assignments based on eyes examination. The manganese, Rare Earth and cobalt content also contribute to identify the production places.

AMD discharges offer generally high sulfate concentrations, especially from the bituminous coal region of Pennsylvania; unconventional Marcellus shale gas wells generally yield HFFF enriched in alkaline earth metals such as Sr and Ba, known to cause scaling issues in oil and gas (O&G) production. Mixing the two waters can precipitate HFFF-Ba and -Sr with AMD-SO4, therefore removing them from solution.

Total removal efficiencies of Ba + Sr + SO4 and the proportion of Ba and Sr in BaxSr1-xSO4 depended upon the Ba/Sr ratio in the initial HFFF. A geochemical model was calibrated from batch reactor data and used to identify optimum AMD-HFFF mixing ratios that maximize total removal efficiencies (Ba + Sr + SO4) for reuse in O&G development.

Thermodynamic exploration has been investigated regarding minimum separation work and second-law efficiency at various concentrations in the air. The influence of concentration, adsorption temperature, desorption temperature and desorption pressure on the energy efficiency has also been evaluated. Results show that the minimum separation work for the level of 400 ppm is approximately 20 kJ/mol.

In this paper, the impact of the EU Emission Trading Scheme (EU ETS) for CO2 combined with sulfur dioxide (SO2) and nitrogen oxides (NOx) emission trading mechanism on power technology choice was studied using Market Allocation (MARKAL) model of Polish power system. Poland can contribute to achieving ambitious EU CO2 emission reduction goals to 2050 by switching to diversified electricity mix of low-carbon coal technologies with CCS, and carbon free options e.g. nuclear, biomass IGCC, wind onshore and offshore. This 'low-carbon' mix can be achieved only at high emission allowance prices, stimulated by the introduction of Market Stability Reserve to EU ETS and successive decrease in EU CO2 emission cap. At high emission allowance prices, Poland's CO2 emissions from ETS-participating electricity generating plants are expected to decrease in 2010-2050 period by 96-99%, depending on the projected electricity consumption. Model results prove that SO2/NOx, emission trading scheme, envisaged in Poland, is not effective, in view. of Industrial Emission Directive implementation, and should be reconsidered.

The processes involving CO2 capture and storage (CCS) are gaining attention as an alternative for reducing CO2 concentration in the ambient air. However, these technologies are considered as short-term solutions, as there are still concerns about the environmental sustainability of these processes. A promising technology could be the biological capture of CO2 using microalgae due to its unmatched advantages over higher plants and ocean fertilization. Microalgae are phototrophic microorganisms with simple nutritional requirements, and comprising the major primary producers on this planet. Specific pathways include autotrophic production via both open pond or closed photobioreactor (PBR) systems. Photosynthetic efficiency of microalgae ranged from 10-20 % in comparison with 1-2 % of most terrestrial plants. Some algal species, during their exponential growth, can double their biomass in periods as short as 3.5 hours. Moreover, advantage of being tolerant of high concentration of CO2 (flue gas), low light intensity requirements, environmentally sustainable, and co-producing added value products put these as the favoured organisms. Advantages of microalgae in comparison with other sequestration methodologies are discussed, which includes the cultivation systems, the key process parameters, wastewater treatment, harvesting and the novel bio-products produced by microalgal biomass.",,,,,,,,,124,2,0,0,64,0,132,,,1381-2386,1573-1596,,,,,,,,,,"Panjab Univ, Dept Bot, Lab Algal Biol & Divers, Chandigarh 160014, India",,,,2013-02-05,WOS:000312784900006,,

In turn, the cycling of iron in aquatic systems can influence the fate of nutrients, alter primary productivity, enhance accumulation of trace metals and induce fractionation of rare earth elements (REE). In this study we examine a reach of a pristine oligotrophic alpine stream bracketing a 30 year-old landslide and explore the consequences of landslide-induced Fe mobilisation for aqueous geochemistry and the composition of benthic stream cobble biofilm Elevated Fe2+ and Mn in landslide zone stream waters reflect inputs of circumneutral groundwater from the landslide debris-zone floodplain. Geochemical characteristics are consistent with reductive dissolution being a primary mechanism of Fe2+ and Mn mobilisation. Stream cobble biofilm in the landslide zone is significantly (P < 0.01) enriched in poorly crystalline Fe(III) (similar to 10-400 times background) and Mn (similar to 15-150 times background) (1 M HC1 extractable; Fe(III)(Ab)). While the landslide zone accounts for less than similar to 9% of the total stream length, we estimate it is responsible for approximately 60-80% of the stream's benthic biofilm load of poorly crystalline Fe(III) and Mn. Biofilm Fe(III) precipitates are comprised mainly of ferrihydrite, lepidocrocite and an organic-Fe species, while precipitate samples collected proximal to hyporheic seeps contain abundant sheath structures characteristic of the neutrophilic Fe(II)-oxidising bacteria Leptothrix spp. Stream-cobble Fe(III)-rich biofilm is accumulating PO43-(similar to 3-30 times background) and behaving as a preferential substrate for photosynthetic periphyton, with benthic PO, chlorophyll a, organic carbonim and total N all significantly positively correlated with Fe(III)Ab and significantly elevated within the landslide zone (P <0.01). P K-edge XANES indicates P is associated with both ferric and Ca-phosphate minerals, while SEM-EDX elemental mapping of Fe(III) precipitates reveal strong spatial associations between P, Ca and Fe. Cobble Fe(III)-rich biofilm is also sorbing and accumulating multiple trace metals and REE. Within the landslide zone there are significant (P < 0.01) enrichments (up to similar to 10-100 times background) for most trace metals examined here and metals display significant positive linear correlations with Fe(III)(Ab) on a log transformed basis. Stream cobble biofilm also exhibits distinct REE fractionation along the flow path, with light REE (La, Ce, Nd, Pr) preferentially partitioning to the Fe(III) and Mn-rich biofilm within the landslide zone. Accumulation of PO43- and trace metals in this relatively environmentally labile form may have implications for their bioavailability and downstream transport, but further research is required to assess possible ecological consequences. This study demonstrates the potential for large alpine landslides to encourage reach-scale circumneutral Fe mobilisation in adjacent streams, thereby shaping multiple aspects of benthic stream geochemistry for many years after the landslide event itself.

The extensive tropical forest of Papua New Guinea (PNG) is a target for such efforts and yet local carbon estimates are few. Previous estimates, based on models of neotropical vegetation applied to PNG forest plots, did not consider such factors as the unique species composition of New Guinea vegetation, local variation in forest biomass, or the contribution of small trees. We analysed all trees >1cm in diameter at breast height (DBH) in Melanesia's largest forest plot (Wanang) to assess local spatial variation and the role of small trees in carbon storage. Above-ground living biomass (AGLB) of trees averaged 210.72 Mgha(-1) at Wanang. Carbon storage at Wanang was somewhat lower than in other lowland tropical forests, whereas local variation among 1-ha subplots and the contribution of small trees to total AGLB were substantially higher. We speculate that these differences may be attributed to the dynamics of Wanang forest where erosion of a recently uplifted and unstable terrain appears to be a major source of natural disturbance. These findings emphasize the need for locally calibrated forest carbon estimates if accurate landscape level valuation and monetization of carbon is to be achieved.

OSRAM generates oil spill trajectories using meteorological and hydrological data input from either actual physical measurements or estimates generated from other hydrological models. OSRAM and many other models produce output matrices of average, maximum and minimum contact probabilities to specific landfall or target segments (columns) from oil spills at specific points (rows). Analysts and managers are often interested in identifying geographic areas or groups of facilities that pose similar risks to specific targets or groups of targets if a spill occurred. Unfortunately, due to the potentially large matrix generated by many spill models, this question is difficult to answer without the use of data reduction and visualization methods. In our study we utilized a multivariate statistical method called cluster analysis to group areas of similar risk based on potential distribution of landfall target trajectory probabilities. We also utilized ArcView(TM) GIS to display spill launch point groupings. The combination of GIS and multivariate statistical techniques in the post-processing of trajectory model output is a powerful tool for identifying and delineating areas of similar risk from multiple spill sources. We strongly encourage modelers, statistical and GIS software programmers to closely collaborate to produce a more seamless integration of these technologies and approaches to analyzing data. They are complimentary methods that strengthen the overall assessment of spill risks. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V.

As an alternative to the fastidious cutting and weighing measurement approach, we explored a non-destructive terrestrial laser scanning approach to estimate the aboveground biomass of large mangroves (diameters reaching up to 125 cm). Because of buttresses in large trees, we propose a pixel-based analysis of the composite 2D flattened images, obtained from the successive thin segments of stem point-cloud data to estimate wood volume.

Statistically significant (at the 953 confidence level, corresponding uncertainties in parentheses) increasing trends of 0.017 (0.01) x 10(15) and 0.015 (0.006) x 10(15) molecules cm(-2) year(-1) over 2004-2015 were found for Bakken (USA) and Athabasca (Canada), two areas having recently experienced fast expansion in the oil industry. This rapid change has implications for emission inventories, which are updated less frequently. No significant trend was found for the North Sea (Europe), where oil production has been declining since the 1990s. For northern Russia, the trend was just under the 95% significance threshold at 0.0057 (0.006) x 10(15) molecules cm(-2) year This raises an interesting inconsistency as prior studies have suggested that, in contrast to the continued, albeit slow, expansion of Russian oil/gas production, gas flaring in Russia has decreased in recent years. However, only a fraction of oil fields in Russia were covered in our analysis. Satellite aerosol optical depth (AOD) data revealed similar tendencies, albeit at a weaker level of statistical significance, due to the longer lifetime of aerosols and contributions from other sources. This study demonstrates that synergetic use of data from multiple satellite sensors can provide valuable information on pollutant emission sources that is otherwise difficult to acquire.

In the Gulf Region, this issue is especially complex due to harsh-arid environments and increasing anthropogenic input of pollutants from the energy industry. The emergence of nations rich in oil and gas, such as Qatar, but poor in water resources requires new and dynamic systems and plans for managing limited water resources in times of extreme growth, such plans are discussed in this paper. The State of Qatar's average annual evaporation rate is 30 times more than precipitation and the country depends on desalinated water to meet 99 % of its municipal water needs. Additionally, increasing population growth coupled with tremendous urbanization and industrialization add more stress to the existing renewable water resources, and newly produced water, namely desalted seawater and treated wastewater. Absence of water tariff and a water pricing system along with a lack of conservation awareness places Qatar as one of the highest water consuming countries in the world. Municipal water consumption per capita per day reached 500 L/ca.d for the year 2013. Dumping of sea to build new cities and construct towers makes the area very susceptible to salt water instruction, a phenomenon that does not only affect the groundwater aquifer system but also the construction materials and building deformations. Currently, Qatar uses the most advanced technologies for treating wastewater; however, the pure treated wastewater is not considered a viable water resource and is not used in areas of critical water demand such as agriculture and landscaping. Social, religious, and local marketing views limit the current use of treated wastewater. Integrated water and wastewater management strategies are absent and the national players of the two sectors -water and wastewater-are different. Current plans for integrated water resources management (IWRM) cannot answer the basic questions, what to manage and in which scale; is it the brackish and unused groundwater or the desalinated water from the existing technologies, the supply or the demand or all? This paper tries to highlight some facts related to Qatar's water situation as an arid Gulf State and introduces potential ideas for IWRM. The critical aspects of IWRM discussed herein are relevant to a number of nations in the global community dealing with issues of extreme water insecurity.",,,,,,,,,35,0,0,0,10,0,40,,,0920-4741,1573-1650,,,,,,,,,,"Qatar Fdn, Qatar Environm & Energy Res Inst, Doha, Qatar",,,,2014-08-01,WOS:000338651100005,,

Additionally, changes in soil carbon storage will influence carbon accounting schemes that may play a role in climate change mitigation programs. We applied a digital soil mapping approach to examine and map (at 100-m resolution) potential changes in three important soil properties - soil organic carbon (SOC), pH and sum-of-bases (common macro-nutrients) - resulting from projected climate change over south-eastern Australia until similar to 2070. Four global climate models were downscaled with three regional models to give 12 climate models, which were used to derive changes for the three properties across the province, at 0-30 and 30-100 cm depth intervals. The SOC stocks were projected to decline over the province, while pH and sum-of-bases were projected to increase; however, the extent of change varied throughout the province and with different climate models. The average changes primarily reflected the complex interplay of changing temperatures and rainfall throughout the province. The changes were also influenced by the operating environmental conditions, with a uniform pattern of change particularly demonstrated for SOC over 36 combinations of current climate, parent material and land use. For example, the mean decline of SOC predicted for the upper depth interval was 15.6 Mg ha(-1) for wet-mafic-native vegetation regimes but only 3.1 Mg ha(-1) for dry-highly siliceous-cropping regimes.

Our new method was tested using multiple real samples and was compared with the BaSO4 precipitation method. The results based on the LSC were 30% higher than the precipitation method, which is attributed to the self-absorption of alpha particles in the BaSO4 precipitate.

Initial laboratory results indicated the efficacy of an adapted consortium in terms of degradation of petroleum hydrocarbons, with complete degradation of the contaminants occurring after 21 days. Microbial counts confirmed a bacterial increase during the degradation and an ecotoxicological assessment using Brassica rapa confirmed a reduction in the toxicity of the treated soil. In field studies for example, initial processed petroleum hydrocarbon concentrations of 26,240; 622,657; and 978,399 mg kg(-1) in 250 tonnes of soil were degraded to <1000 mg kg(-1) in 9,12 and 17 weeks, respectively following the bioaugmentation treatment. A 100% germination rate of Brassica rapa was also observed in the field for all the treated soil batches except for soils further contaminated with oil tank bottom sludge. Moreover, further total petroleum hydrocarbons (TPH) analysis performed 3 years after the treatment confirmed that their concentrations have remained low (7-35 mg kg(-1)) all over the site.

A considerable part of soil carbon is protected from microbial attack by a range of physical and chemical mechanisms and is not sensitive to landuse change. We analyzed the soils data base for Sumatra (Indonesia) developed by the Center for Soil and Agroclimate Research (CSAR) to estimate effects of landuse on soil C content. Sumatra has a considerable diversity of soils ranging from those of recent origin in the highlands, to older sedimentary and heavily leached soils in the pediment peneplain and large areas of wetland soils along the coast. Feat soils (Histosols) and other wetland soils (Aquic and Fluvic suborders) contain the greatest soil C reserves, followed by young volcanic soils (Andisols). Agricultural use of these soils can have a disproportionately large effect on C release to the atmosphere. On the major part of the upland soils the difference in (top) soil C content between natural forest and agricultural land is in the range 0.5-1.0% C, equivalent to a change in total C stock of 10-20 Mg ha(-1). These results agree with data collected in S. Sumatra in the 1930s. C-org of forest soils is related to soil pH, and is lowest in the pH range 5.0-6.0. Wetland conditions, lower pH, higher altititude (lower temperature) and higher clay and silt content all contributed to higher soil C contents in a multiple regression analysis of the whole data set. Existing models and data sets are insufficient to predict changes in soil C contents under various landuse practices. Carbon isotope studies, and especially the delta(13)C method may be used to study the effects of landuse change, especially when the vegetation was changed from one dominated by C3 plants (most forest species) to one dominated by grasses and crops with a C4 photosynthetic pathway. Results from Brazil documented a gradual decline of organic matter originating from the forest system and its partial replacement by organic matter derived from inputs of sugarcane during the first fifty years of cultivation. Forest conversion to well managed grasslands may lend to an increased soil C storage, after an initial decline. The consequences of erosion on losses of soil C depend on the scale at which these losses are considered, because of sedimentation processes. When net erosion losses are not expressed per unit area, but per length scale to the power 1.6, erosion losses appear to be largely independent of scale. The 'fractal dimension of erosion' (on average around 1.6) probably is a landscape characteristic and estimates of its value are needed for extrapolation. Better understanding of soil C deposition sites is needed to evaluate overall erosion effects and test whether or not erosion can contribute to net C sequestration.

Photographs were enhanced using geometric correction, and the shoreline and beach width were extracted using a wet/dry line. Decadal changes were statistically analyzed using the Digital Shoreline Analysis System, 4.3 (DSAS). The sediment budget of the watershed was calculated using the Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE) and a correlation analysis was then conducted against beach width. The impact of typhoon Thelma which occurred in 1987 was strongly observed, and its occurrence prevented any clear trends in shoreline changes from being observed between 1948 and 2017, although a dike constructed on northern part of the beach caused strong deposition in transect 1 from 2009. In addition, the beach width was found to be relatively narrow at the both end of the beach and in the center where a small stream flows. The annual rate of change in beach width was 0.31 m in the northern part, 0.23 m in the central part, and 0.25 m in the southern part meaning sedimentation. The sediment budget of the watershed was positively correlated with beach width; and this result highlights the importance of proficient watershed management with respect to beach management. It was evident that the artificial structure constructed in the middle part of the beach had an influence on sediment transport, and changes related to the typhoon were evident; these results indicate that shoreline changes are affected by various factors, including the human impact on the watershed and natural conditions, and it is thus necessary to use a spatially integrated management approach that involves all these factors.",,,,,3rd International Water Safety Symposium (IWSS)3rd International Water Safety Symposium (IWSS),"JUN 19-23, 2018JUN 19-23, 2018",,"Incheon, SOUTH KOREAIncheon, SOUTH KOREA",2,0,0,0,1,0,2,,,0749-0208,1551-5036,,,,,,,,,,"Seoul Natl Univ, Zero Land Space Creat Grp BK21plus 4, Seoul, South KoreaKorea Maritime Inst, Busan, South Korea",,,,2019-10-04,WOS:000485724400064,,

Geological uncertainties, high pressure flammable fluids in the presence of ignition sources, complicated structural layouts, limited response time allowance, difficulty of control and communication are some of the critical factors that pose clear threats toward safe operations and may result in high consequence events, e.g., blowouts. Developing well specified risk indicators is difficult due to such highly correlated factors and multifaceted operations. Leading indicators, which are able to identify critical events that could lead to high consequence events, have proven to be an effective tool that can help the operators in their decision making to react earlier to an event and to reduce the risk of an incident. Most of the research dedicated to leading and lagging indicators are applicable to the petrochemical industry, and there is not yet an agreement on a definition and classification of leading indicators for drilling related blowouts. This paper discusses the approaches of different organizations and institutes on leading indicators characterization and development. The drilling industry is compared with the aviation industry to identify potential elements for developing a comprehensive leading indicators framework. A workable definition of leading indicators is proposed considering the intricacy of offshore operations. Leading indicators are broadly categorized into two classes which are further segmented into different groups.

These activities were split in two steps for each site: structural modeling and property modeling.The data available at the time of the building of the static models consisted of the following: 241 2D seismic lines across the entire Turceni area, 58 wells with some associated logs, of which notably -16 in Zone 1, of which 9 are deep wells (crossing the entire Sarmatian sequence) and 44 in Zone 5, of which 16 are deep wells. Some of these wells are shallow wells according with the TD and according with the bottom hole formation (they drilled only the upper part of the Sarmatian). All the others are deep wells, they have drilled almost the entire Sarmatian sequence, some of them found the Tertiary base. In the 'wells with logs' groups there are 16 deep wells and 28 shallow wells in Zone 5, 9 deep wells and 7 shallow wells in Zone 1 respectively. Using the logs, geological markers from the wells and all the geological information from the bibliography, technical reports and other sources, the Sarmatian deposits have been divided into several layers (Sa2, Sa3, Sa4, Sa5, Sa5a, Sa6, Sa7, Sa8), each of them characterized by different characteristics as can be seen on the wells correlations.The seismic lines have been acquired and processed according with the different technologies according with the available methods from the time when they have been acquired. In the area there are seismic lines acquired from 1973 till 2005. Some of the old seismic data have been reprocessed later on but due to the quality of the raw data the quality of the processed seismic lines did not improve too much. The Sarmatian deposits are characterized by parallel, horizontal seismic horizons with good continuity and variable amplitude according with lithological and fluid content changes.The faults are developed on different seismic lines but was very difficult to correlate from a line to another and in such a way to define if it is a fault with major importance and extension or is very local ones. Some of faults are developed only in the tertiary sequences that means that these are formed by gravitational processes done by differential compaction of lithological columns with different thickness which in general decrease in net slip in the upper part. Such kind of faults have a local development and because they affected an unconsolidated or poor consolidate geological formations they are close faults and not create an open space and in general these faults are formed above the uplifted blocks or a prominent high of the relief.Most of these wells have lithological marker information (well tops) and resistivity logs (including SP). However these logs have not been made available. One well has a GR log, 2 wells have a sonic log, 2 wells have a neutron log; 7 wells have checkshot information. While the seismic coverage appears sufficient to build a structural model with a reasonable level of detail for this stage, it is evident that the scarcity of petrophysical information is likely to affect the reliability of the property models. The static model from zone 1and zone 5 have been created using: fault modeling, pillar gridding, make horizons, make zones, layering, facies calculation, scale up well logs, facies modeling, properties modeling.The facies modeling, reflects the knowledge of the depositional environment of the site. The regional (depositional) facies respects the assumptions of the source rock and sedimentation direction; the methods chosen to model the lithofacies (newfacies), conditioned to each of depositional facies types defined above, appear adequate for the environment.distribution of petrophysical properties (porosity and permeability) has been modeled separately for each facies type (petrophysical model conditioned to facies model). This is the recommended way to capture the lithological variations previously modeled.The source for these properties is normally the corresponding upscaled well logs. However, this is apparently not the case for the static models reviewed here: only the minimum and maximum values for each facies type were input in the petrophysical modeling process.Using the static model created for the two zones, 1 and 5, two injection areas have been selected for CO2 injection. The selection of these CO2 injection areas took in consideration the lithological content of geological formations from Sarmatian deposits, depth of the reservoirs, the existence of a proper seal rocks above the reservoirs.

However, increasing fuel costs and regulatory pressure such as the restrictions placed on sulphur content have increased interest in the use of alternative fuels. A number of alternative fuels have been identified and may be viable for use within the maritime sector including straight vegetable oil (SVO) as an alternative to HFO in low speed engines, biodiesel to replace MDO/MGO in low to medium speed engines and bio-liquefied natural gas (bio-LNG) in gas engines using LNG. The potential sources of biomass feedstocks, conversion pathways and technologies are identified. The key parameters limiting their potential application are examined, in particular, availability, technological development, technical integration, and operational consequences.

Preceding the stranding event, large volumes of cold freshwater entered the nGOM due to unusually large snowmelt on the adjacent watershed, providing a third potential stressor. We consider the possibility that this extreme cold and freshwater event contributed to the pattern of perinatal dolphin strandings along the nGOM coast. During the 4-month period starting January 2011, 186 bottlenose dolphins, including 46% perinatal calves (nearly double the percentage for the same time period from 2003-2010) washed ashore from Louisiana to western Florida. Comparison of the frequency distribution of strandings to flow rates and water temperature at a monitoring buoy outside Mobile Bay, Alabama (the 4th largest freshwater drainage in the U. S.) and along the nGOM coast showed that dolphin strandings peaked in Julian weeks 5, 8, and 12 (February and March), following water temperature minima by 2-3 weeks. If dolphin condition was already poor due to depleted food resources, bacterial infection, or other factors, it is plausible that the spring freshet contributed to the timing and location of the unique stranding event in early 2011. These data provide strong observational evidence to assess links between the timing of the DWHOS, other local environmental stressors, and mortality of a top local predator. Targeted analyses of tissues from stranded dolphins will be essential to define a cause of death, and our findings highlight the importance of considering environmental data along with biological samples to interpret stranding patterns during and after an unusual mortality event.",,,,,,,,,53,0,0,0,45,0,64,,,1932-6203,,,,,,,,,,,"Dauphin Isl Sea Lab, Univ Programs, Dauphin Isl, AL USAUniv S Alabama, Dept Marine Sci, Mobile, AL 36688 USAUniv So Mississippi, Dept Marine Sci, Stennis Space Ctr, MS USAUniv Cent Florida, Dept Biol, Orlando, FL 32816 USA",,,,2012-07-18,WOS:000306548900084,22815950,

Starting production activities in these areas without any facility-especially pipelines-is a challenge because the investment necessary is high, particularly when the first area to be produced is a gas block. The financial feasibility of a small- or medium-sized gas field with very low condensate production is extremely delicate because this kind of project usually demands high initial investments, particularly with topside facilities, platform structures, and pipelines.The financial scenario worsens as the first investment must consider not only the area to be put into production, but also other potential areas nearby with exploration still under way. To foresee fluid composition and all flow-parameter scenarios is a complex but necessary exercise to reduce risk and keep the operating expenditure (OPEX) as low as possible.One of the aims of this paper is to show one experience in the design of offshore gas fields in the shallow waters of Espirito Santo, Brazil, where pipeline-corrosion management and integrity strongly affected the capital expenditure (CAPEX) and OPEX factors because the flow-rate capacity was overdesigned to transport future production from adjacent fields.This paper discusses some of the newer issues related to the CO2-corrosion-risk-assessment and -integrity strategies. The paper also briefly discusses some current key issues regarding the ultradeepwater fields related to areas of uncertainties caused by internal corrosion, such as pipelines operating under supercritical flow and steel catenary risers operating within a corrosion-fatigue environment.",,,,,2004 Offshore Technology Conference2004 Offshore Technology Conference,"MAY 03-06, 2004MAY 03-06, 2004",,"Houston, TXHouston, TX",2,0,0,0,0,0,2,,,1064-668X,,,,,,,,,,,"Petrobras E&P UN Espirito Santo, Gas Prod & Proc Asset, Salvador, BA, BrazilPetrobras R&D CENPES, Res Ctr, Mat Equipment & Corros Technol Dept, Rio De Janeiro, BrazilPetrobras R&D CENPES, Campos Basin Business Unit, Rio De Janeiro, BrazilPetrobras E&P UN Espirito Santo, Espirito Santo Business E&P Unit, Salvador, BA, Brazil",Petrobras E&P UN Espirito SantoPetrobras R&D CENPESPetrobras E&P UN Espirito Santo,,,2005-11-01,WOS:000233503100007,,

In 2011, above-average rainfall led to significant vegetation growth and a 'greening' of inland Australia. During the period 2008-2012, we measured aboveground growth rates, biomass accumulation and C sequestration by river red gums (Eucalyptus camaldulensis), a commonly occurring tree species in riparian and floodplain ecosystems in semi-arid inland Australia. We measured trees representing the full range of ages, stand densities, canopy conditions and landscape positions. Our data suggest that river red gums can grow up to 6 cm (diameter at 1.3 m aboveground) per year, with most trees growing at a rate of <3 cm per year and sequestering on average, just over 2.5 t Cha(-1)yr(-1) in aboveground woody biomass during high-rainfall and flood conditions. In general, trees in riparian zones grew faster than trees on the floodplain and trees in dense stands grew more slowly than widely-spaced trees. Sites with high aboveground woody biomass at the start of the study had the highest growth and C sequestration rates, indicating that those sites had not reached their C carrying capacity. Healthy crown condition was associated with faster growth in trunk diameter. While stem increment decreased with tree size, C sequestration increased in aboveground woody biomass, illustrating the importance of mature and old-growth trees as C sinks. This study highlights the contribution of semi-arid riparian woodlands for sequestering large amounts of C in aboveground woody biomass during above-average rainfall periods and the need to factor this important sink into global C budgets.

The poor economy does not allow the import of fossil fuels, particularly oil, on a large scale. Moreover, too much reliance on imported oil is critical from energy security point of view. A large fraction of the population lives in remote areas and is still waiting to be connected to the national electricity grid. To help these remote communities in particular, and to overcome energy shortages in general, Pakistan needs to develop its indigenous energy resources like hydropower, solar and wind. More than 1000 km long coastline in south and some places in northern mountainous areas provide an excellent resource of wind energy. This vast potential can be exploited to produce electricity on both community and wind farm scales. Applications other than electricity production, such as water pumping, also have vast applications. This article discusses the past, the present and the future of wind energy use in Pakistan. The efforts for the utilization of wind energy in the country are presented as well, along with barriers to its development. It is concluded that the potential exists, but significant efforts are needed to effectively make use of this cheap renewable energy source. (C) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

The efficacy of eight organic formulations was assessed by mass loss, potentiodynamic polarization, linear polarization resistance and electrochemical impedance. CNSL and R were characterized by FTIR, H-1 NMR and TGA. The mass loss tests (298-353 K) revealed maximum efficiency of 99.47%, which was confirmed by electrochemical measurements. The formulations acted as mixed inhibitors. Molecular adsorption probably occurs through the oxygens and pi electrons of the aromatic rings in agreement with DFT results.

Also, many platforms are reaching the end of their design lives. Ensuring riser integrity is one of the most important issues for platform safety and service-life extension. Currently, monitoring sensors are deployed on risers, and structural evaluation methods are utilized to examine riser integrity. However, there are some limitations to the structural evaluation methods. Furthermore, platform operators continue to seek for more direct and cost-effective riser monitoring method due to the low price of oil.

Disturbances have highly diverse impacts on forest carbon dynamics, making them a challenge to quantify and report. Time since disturbance is a key intermediate determinant that aids the assessment of disturbance-driven carbon emissions and removals legacies. We propose a new methodology of quantifying time since disturbance and carbon flux across forested landscapes in the Pacific Northwest (PNW) at a fine scale (30 m) by combining remote sensing (RS)-based disturbance year, disturbance type, and above-ground biomass with forest inventory data. When a recent disturbance is detected, time since disturbance can be directly determined by combining three RS-derived disturbance products, or time since the last stand clearing can be inferred from a RS-derived 30m biomass map and field inventory-derived species-specific biomass accumulation curves. Net ecosystem productivity (NEP) is further mapped based on carbon stock and flux trajectories derived from the Carnegie-Ames-Stanford Approach (CASA) model in our prior work that described how NEP changes with time following harvest, fire, or bark beetle disturbances of varying severity. Uncertainties from biomass map and forest inventory data were propagated by probabilistic sampling to provide a statistical distribution of stand age and NEP for each forest pixel. We mapped mean, standard deviation, and statistical distribution of stand age and NEP at 30m in the PNW region. Our map indicated a net ecosystem productivity of 5.9 Tg C yr(-1) for forestlands circa 2010 in the study area, with net uptake in relatively mature (>24 years old) forests (13.6 Tg C yr(-1)) overwhelming net negative NEP from tracts that had recent harvests (-6.4 TgC yr(-1)), fires (-0.5 TgC yr(-1)), and bark beetle outbreaks (-0.8 TgC yr(-1)). The approach will be applied to forestlands in other regions of the conterminous US to advance a more comprehensive monitoring, mapping, and reporting of the carbon consequences of forest change across the US.",,,,,,,,,14,0,0,0,7,0,17,,,1726-4170,1726-4189,,,,,,,,,,"Clark Univ, Grad Sch Geog, Worcester, MA 01610 USAUniv Maryland, Dept Geog Sci, College Pk, MD 20742 USA",,,,2016-12-28,WOS:000388715400002,,

In general, concentrations (0.1 to 43.2 mu g l(-1), mean 4.8 mu g l(-1), Chrysene equivalents) were higher in summer. Concentrations of total aliphatic hydrocarbons were from 17.2 to 2326.5 mu g l(-1) (mean 543.3 mu g l(-1)). The major component was the unresolved complex mixture (UCM), comprising from 78% to 97% of the total aliphatic hydrocarbons. Total PAH concentrations varied from 89 mu g l(-1) to 294 mu g l(-1) (mean 179 mu g l(-1)). The most contaminated sites were the marina of San Giusto and the municipal harbor of Piran.Different evaluation indeces were applied to determine the origin of hydrocarbons. The prevailing origin of aliphatic hydrocarbons is petrogenic, with the significant contribution of the biogenic at some sites. The results presented indicate the fresh inputs of hydrocarbons, which are subject to intense degradation processes. The PAH group profile showed the predominance of 2-3 ring PAHs. PAHs were of mixed origin with more pronounced petrogenic origin, presumably due to oil spills from ships and boats. The presence of a relatively high content of perylene in seawater is an indication of its terrestrial input.According to the presented results and compared to results from different areas worldwide, the seawater in the Gulf of Trieste can still be considered slightly to moderately polluted with PAHs.",,,,,,,,,10,0,0,0,9,0,10,,,0025-326X,1879-3363,,,,,,,,,,"Skofije 23, Skofije 6281, SloveniaNatl Inst Biol, Marine Biol Stn Piran, Piran 6330, Slovenia",,,,2019-07-24,WOS:000474319500013,31232282,

This structuring implied an assumption that genotype x region interactions are important relative to genotype x environment interactions within regions, but this had not been tested. A research project was initiated in 1997 to help address this issue and the implications arising for breeding programs. It was found that genotype x region interactions were small relative to genotype main effects and GE interactions within regions for both cane yield and CCS. This is consistent with trials from different regions generally having genetic correlations that were not much less (average 75% and 85% for cane yield and CCS respectively) than correlations between trials within the same region. In general, these results support a move toward a more integrated breeding program in Australia. More specifically, this should involve data analysis methodology that takes account of genetic correlations between regions for different traits (cane yield, CCS) and whereby results from all regions are combined and clone performance is predicted for all regions. Clones with highest predicted value for regions different to those in which field trial testing has already occurred should be directly included in final assessment trials in those new regions. This procedure would contrast to the practice used in the past of placing such clones back into single row plots before deciding on advancement to final assessment trials or not.

This is more significant specifically in off-shore oil and gas platforms where releasing hydrocarbons could cause irreversible damages to both environment and personnel. An important instrument device which can provide safety for process equipment in oil and gas fields is safety relief valve. Correct sizing procedure of such devices depends strongly on physical properties of fluid and relieving condition. The present study revolved around applying thermodynamic concepts and modeling to throw some light on the behavior of trapped fluid exposed to fire in order to evaluate precise temperature and fluid properties at relieving condition. Peng Robinson equation of state together with a three phase flash has been utilized to handle the calculation. Effect of different design parameters has been evaluated for three distinct categories of fluids namely natural gas, gas-condensate mixture, and gas-oil mixtures. These parameters encompass of operating temperature, operating pressure, Difference of Operating and Design Pressure, gas and oil specific gravities, gas-oil ratio, and water cut. The study depicted that American Petroleum Institute practice number 521 which suggests an ideal gas assumption fails to provide reliable predictions as it significantly overestimate the relieving temperature. Moreover, black oil correlations were also used for the relief temperature estimation of gas-oil-water mixtures. Comparison with HYSYS results as a prominent engineering software proved that black oil models are reliable tools to predict relief temperature. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

The initial production of hydrocarbons (gas or oil) and the resulting pressure depletion as well as associated reduction in horizontal stresses (e.g., fracture gradient) narrow the operational drilling mud weight window, which could exacerbate wellbore instabilities while infill drilling. Well completions (casing, liners, etc.) may experience solids flowback to the injector wells when injection is interrupted due to CO2 supply or during required system maintenance. CO2 injection alters the pressure and temperature in the near wellbore region, which could cause fault reactivation or thermal fracturing. In addition, the injection pressure may exceed the maximum sustainable storage pressure, and cause fracturing and fault reactivation within the reservoirs or bounding formations. A systematic approach has been developed for geomechanical assessments for CO2 storage in depleted reservoirs. The approach requires a robust field geomechanical model with its components derived from drilling and production data as well as from wireline logs of historical wells. This approach is described in detail in this paper together with a recent study on a depleted gas field in the North Sea considered for CO2 sequestration. The particular case study shows that there is a limitation on maximum allowable well inclinations, 45A degrees if aligning with the maximum horizontal stress direction and 65A degrees if aligning with the minimum horizontal stress direction, beyond which wellbore failure would become critical while drilling. Evaluation of sanding risks indicates no sand control installations would be needed for injector wells. Fracturing and faulting assessments confirm that the fracturing pressure of caprock is significantly higher than the planned CO2 injection and storage pressures for an ideal case, in which the total field horizontal stresses increase with the reservoir re-pressurization in a manner opposite to their reduction with the reservoir depletion. However, as the most pessimistic case of assuming the total horizontal stresses staying the same over the CO2 injection, faulting could be reactivated on a fault with the least favorable geometry once the reservoir pressure reaches approximately 7.7 MPa. In addition, the initial CO2 injection could lead to a high risk that a fault with a cohesion of less than 5.1 MPa could be activated due to the significant effect of reduced temperature on the field stresses around the injection site.",,,,,,,,,9,1,0,0,2,0,10,,,0723-2632,1434-453X,,,,,,,,,,"Baker Hughes GMI Geomech Serv, Kuala Lumpur, MalaysiaBaker Hughes GMI Geomech Serv, Perth, WA, Australia",Baker Hughes GMI Geomech ServBaker Hughes GMI Geomech Serv,,,2013-05-15,WOS:000317685000006,,

CO2 concentration impacts the thermal properties of the atmosphere, performing as a so called “greenhouse gas” to impact climate. Changes in atmospheric concentrations also equilibrate with and change ocean chemistry.One mechanism proposed and being deployed in early projects to reduce atmospheric emission of CO2 from large stationary sources such as power plants and carbon-intensive industries is known as carbon capture and storage (CCS). Facilities capture the CO2 from stacks or vents prior to emission to the atmosphere and concentrate it by separation of the CO2 from other gases and by compression. The resulting “dense phase” CO2 is transported to be injected into selected and permitted porous rock units in the deep subsurface for storage. Storage units selected must be shown to be below and hydrologically separated from potable water and provide assurance that the storage is effective. Demonstration of effective storage requires collection of characterization data and construction of numerical models showing that the natural environment can accept the volume of fluid planned and effectively isolate (sequester) it from returning to the atmosphere and from negatively impacting any other resource. This process changes the dynamic from a transfer of carbon geologically in the earth as fossil fuels, and released by combustion to the atmosphere and ocean, to a closed loop system where the carbon is returned to storage in the earth, stabilizing the atmosphere and ocean.Sedimentary rocks commonly provide suitable environments for geologic storage. Porous and permeable rock layers allow fluids to move along them. In the near surface, porous and permeable rocks host groundwater resources. These are protected from injection in the United States by underground injection control (UIC) programs. Similar rock systems in the deeper subsurface locally serve as reservoirs in which oil and gas has naturally accumulated, been stored over geologic time, and from which these fluids can be produced. In addition, injection of resources such as natural gas for storage or hazardous and non-hazardous liquid into porous and permeable sedimentary rocks is a common practice. Interbedded with permeable rocks are fine grained or tightly cemented rock types such as shale, mudrock, tight limestone, anhydrite, or salt. These units are laterally extensive and greatly retard vertical migration of fluids. Low permeability units above the injection zone are known as seals or caprocks, sequences of them are called confining systems.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,150124; R834384,,,,,,,,THE UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS AT AUSTIN,,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:13496275,,

The concentrations of PAHs in the inland lakes were in the upper part of the PAHs levels in aquatic environments from remote and background regions across the globe. The composition profiles of PAHs indicated that PAHs in the inland lakes were derived mainly from local oil spills, which was corroborated by a large number of fuel spillage reports from ship and plane crash incidents in Antarctica during recent years. Clearly, local human activities, rather than long-range transport, are the dominant sources of PAH contamination to the inland lakes.

High reliability and integrity for continuous operation of these systems is crucial to ensure constant supply of hydrocarbon to the onshore processing facility and eventually to market. When such a system is exposed to a series of complex environmental loadings, it is often difficult to predict the response path, in-situ condition and therefore the system's ability to withstand subsequent future loading scenarios.In order to continue to operate the pipeline after a significant environmental event, an overall approach needs to be developed to (a) Understand the system loading and the associated integrity, (b) Develop a series of criteria staging the sequence of actions following an event that will verify the pipeline integrity and (c) Ensure that the integrity management solution is simple and easy to understand so that it can be implemented consistently.For a complex loading scenario, one of the main challenges is the ability to predict the controlling parameter(s) that drives the global integrity of these systems. In such scenarios, the presence of numerous parameters makes the technical modeling and prediction tasks arduous. To address such scenarios, first and foremost, it is crucial to understand the baseline environment data and other associated critical design input elements. If the design environmental baseline has transformed (due to large events e.g. storms etc.) from its original condition; it modifies the dynamics of the system. To address this problem, a thorough modeling and assessment of the in-situ condition is essential. Further, a robust calibration method is required to predict the future response path and therefore expected pipeline condition.The study further compares the planned integrity management solutions to the field data to validate the efficiency of the predicted scenarios. By the inclusion of real field-data feedback to the modeling method, balanced integrity solutions can be achieved and the ability to quantify the risks is made more practical and actionable.",,,,,"34th ASME International Conference on Ocean, Offshore and Arctic Engineering (OMAE2015)34th ASME International Conference on Ocean, Offshore and Arctic Engineering (OMAE2015)","MAY 31-JUN 05, 2015MAY 31-JUN 05, 2015","Amer Soc Mech Engn, Ocean Offshore & Arct Engn DivAmer Soc Mech Engn, Ocean Offshore & Arct Engn Div","St John's, CANADASt John's, CANADA",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,978-0-7918-5651-2,,,,,,,,,"INTECSEA, Houston, TX USA",INTECSEA,,,2016-06-15,WOS:000375807600007,,

Environmental factors such as temperature and precipitation vary greatly with elevation. Hence, it is expected that the carbon storage by CWD varies with elevation. However, few studies have examined the abundance of CWD along elevations. Therefore, we investigated the abundance and decay classes of CWD, aboveground biomass (AGB) and aboveground net primary production (ANPP) of living trees along an elevational gradient (1600-2800 m above sea level) in subalpine coniferous forests, central Japan. AGB, ANPP and CWD decreased with increasing elevation. AGB at 2800 m was about 10% of that at 1600 m a.s.l. On the other hand, CWD at 2800 m was only 2.2% of that at 1600 m a.s.l. Thus, the ratio of CWD to AGB was lower at higher elevations. The relative frequency of small CWD increased with elevation. In addition, smaller CWD tended to decay less. The lower ratio of CWD mass to AGB at higher elevations was probably caused by smaller CWD because small CWD rapidly disappears via the high decomposition rate due to its high ratio of surface area to volume. Therefore, this study suggests that the importance of CWD relative to AGB for carbon storage decreases with elevation in subalpine forests.

More importantly, the proposed method enables the recovery of missing real data based on fusion data from other normal sensors and multivariate Autoregressive Moving Average (ARMA) model. The method is applied to a hawsers' CM system in a Floating Production, Storage and Offloading (FPSO) oil offloading system. The numerical results illustrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed method in realizing CM resilience for such complex and critical systems.

This change has generally been viewed as land degradation, due to shrub-induced declines in pastoral productivity. As a consequence, widespread management treatments to reduce shrub density have been applied in many pastoral areas. These treatments, however, often do not have long-term positive benefits for forage production. Alternative uses for shrub-encroached lands have received little consideration, but a recent move towards economic incentives for carbon (C) storage could lead to financially viable alternative land management strategies. We examined changes in above- and belowground C storage following 20 years of factorial land management treatments (grazing/no grazing and shrub removal/no removal) in an Australian semi-arid woodland. Disturbance by shrub removal (root ploughing) and/or livestock grazing significantly reduced the amount of soil organic carbon (SOC). The most disturbed treatment (grazed and ploughed) contained the least SOC (15.30 Mg C ha(-1)) while protection from grazing and shrub removal led to the greatest SOC (28.49 Mg C ha(-1)). Declines in SOC in shrub removal treatments (with and without grazing) were compensated, in part, by enhanced aboveground C accumulation, derived mainly from woody plants. Destocking currently grazed shrublands for two decades resulted in a net C accretion, over 20 years, in the order of 6.5 Mg ha(-1), almost entirely through increasing belowground C. At the current price for C in Australia, the economic benefit for C accumulation from removing livestock grazing would be similar to the economic benefit of grazing. The results suggest that C farming in this semi-arid woodland system may offer an economically viable alternative management strategy to grazing, although uncertainties in future climate, C credit value, and assessment protocols present hurdles for implementing alternative management aimed at C farming.

The measurements indicate that 99% of the measurements taken prior to capping the well were 32-, 510-, 360-, and 77-fold lower than the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration's Permissible Exposure Limits (PELs) for BTEX, respectively. BTEX measurements did not decrease appreciably during the three months after the well was capped. Moreover, the magnitudes of these data were similar to measurements from ships not involved in oil slick remediation, suggesting that the BTEX measurements were primarily due to engine exhaust rather than the oil slick. To supplement the data analysis, two modeling approaches were employed to estimate airborne BTEX concentrations under a variety of conditions (e.g., oil slick thickness, wind velocity).

The 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil spill allowed us to compare Brown Pelican (Pelecanus occidentalis) demographics during pre- and post-spill years. We banded 1114 pelicans on Louisiana barrier islands from 2007 to 2009, tracked their distribution via band re-sighting surveys from 2008 to 2011, and conducted age-structure surveys. Across Louisiana coastal islands in 2011, we detected 7% of pelicans that had been oiled during the 2010 spill and released following rehabilitation. Similarly, 6% of pelicans (not oiled) banded at the same release site in 2007 were observed across coastal islands 1 yr after banding. We observed variation in proportions of pelicans that were 1, 2, and 3 or more years old among years (2008-2011) and across islands, but little variation could readily be assigned to spill-related mortality. These Brown Pelican demographic trends one year following the Deepwater Horizon oil spill are contrary to other assessments of the impacts of oil contamination on marine birds. However, additional research is required to evaluate potential long-term population trends.RESUMEN Las tendencias demograficas del Pelicano pardo, antes y despues del derrame de petroleo Deepwater Horizon Los derrames de petroleo en el mar pueden tener amplios y efectos perjudiciales sobre las aves acuaticas en las zonas costeras, pero frecuentemente los conjuntos de datos que se refieren al tiempo antes del derrame no estan disponibles para hacer comparaciones demograficas con el periodo que sigue el derrame. En el 2010, el derrame de petroleo Deepwater Horizon nos ha permitido comparar la demografia del Pelicano pardo (Pelecanus occidentalis) durante los anos, antes y despues, del derrame. Entre el 2007 al 2009, colocamos anillos en 1114 pelicanos en las islas de barrera en Luisiana. Luego hemos rastreado la distribucion de estos pelicanos a traves de re-estudios de avistamiento desde el 2008 al 2011, y realizamos encuestas demograficas sobre la estructura de la edad. En las islas costeras de Luisiana en el 2011, detectamos el 7% de pelicanos que habian sido empetrolados durante el derrame en el 2010, pero que fueron llevados a rehabilitacion y liberados cuando terminaron su recuperacion. Del mismo modo, el 6% de los pelicanos (no empetrolados) que fueron anillados en el mismo lugar de liberacion (en el 2007) fueron observados en las islas costeras, un ano despues de ser anillados. Observamos variaciones en los porcentajes de pelicanos que tenian uno, dos, tres o mas anos de edad, entre los anos (2008 - 2011) y a traves de las islas. Poca variacion podria ser asignada a la mortalidad relacionada con el derrame de petroleo. Estos estudios demograficos sobre el Pelicano pardo, hechos un ano despues del derrame de petroleo Deepwater Horizon, son contrarias a otras evaluaciones sobre los impactos de la contaminacion de petroleo sobre las aves marinas.

In this work, Xanthan Gum (XG) was used as an environmentally friendly additive in oil dispersant formulation to enhance the stability and biodegradation of dispersed crude oil droplets. When XG was used together with chemical dispersant 9500A, the dispersion effectiveness of crude oil in artificial sea water (ASW) and the oil droplet stability were both greatly enhanced. In the presence of XG, lower concentration of 9500A was needed to achieve the effective dispersion and stabilization. In addition to the enhancement of dispersion and stabilization, it was found that the biodegradation rate of crude oil by bacteria was dramatically enhanced when a mixture of 9500A and XG was used as a dispersant. Because of the low environmental impact of XG, this would be a potential way to formulate the dispersant with lower toxicity. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

This work allows improvements in global stewardship, hazard mitigation, and more sustaiable resource management.In recent years the development of very powerful x-ray imaging techniques allows us to see inside our samples without destroying them; meaning we understand the internal structures of rocks, soils, ice, plants, animals and man-made materials better than ever before. However, the most cutting edge systems allow us to collect images in just fractions of a second and allow us to put experimental equipment inside the imaging equipment. This means that with the right experimental equipment we could improve our understanding of the processes themselves: by watching them happen. Imaging our geological samples under the relevant geological conditions could help us answer some of the outstanding challenges in earth and environmental research: working at high temperatures we could capture how bubbles drive volcanic eruptions; using pressurised fluid cells we could look at how corals adapt to changing ocean conditions; by imaging while we compress rocks under very high loads we could improve our understanding of fracture propagation during earthquakes; by working at low temperatures we could identify the processes controlling glacier movement or greenhouse gas release from melting permafrost, by imaging soil during wetting and drying we can understand how structure controls nutrient supply and drought resistance in plants; and if we combine pressure and temperature and deformation we can investigate how best to identify, extract and manage critical subsurface resources such as oil, gas, water, metals, minerals, and heat. This proposal will deliver the GeoX suite of experimental apparatus to do just that; allowing earth and environmental researchers to gain new insight and understanding into how the planet works. The GeoX suite includes aparatus that lets us heat and cool our samples, lets us deform them till the break, lets us inject fluids into them or extract fluids from them, or do all of these thindgs at the same time. This means we can investigate almost every environment we are interested in. The reserach done using the GeoX suite could ultimately help us improve our food and energy security, move towards a low carbon and low waste economy, reduce the impact of pollution in soils and sediments, preserve fragile ecosystems and environments, mitigate the effects of climate change, build more sustainable cities, and improve our ability to forecast and manage the risks and effects of natural events such as extreme weather, volcanic eruptions and earthquakes.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,NE/T00908X/1,,,,,,,,University of Strathclyde,,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:15327289,,

The recorded water levels needed for relative elevation analysis are also often lacking. This paper presents a new approach for hindcasting intertidal marsh-top elevations (HIME) to resolve ecogeomorphic change, even in a young, rapidly changing fluvial delta setting, at sub-decadal temporal resolution and at the spatial resolution of widely available optical remote sensing imagery (e.g., 30 m Landsat). The HIME method first calculates: (i) the probability of land exposure in a set of historical imagery from a user-defined discrete timespan (e.g., months or years); (ii) the probability of water level non-exceedance from water level records, which need not be complete nor coincident with the imagery; and (iii) the systematic variation in local mean water level with distance along the primary hydraulic gradient. The HIME method then combines these inputs to estimate a marsh-top elevation map for each historical timespan of interest. The method was developed, validated, applied, and results analyzed to investigate time-lapse evolution of the Wax Lake Delta in Louisiana, USA, every three years, over two decades (1993-2013). The hindcast maps of delta island extents and elevations evidenced ecogeomorphic system self-organization around four stable attractors, or elevation platforms, at about -0.3 m (subtidal), 0.2 m, 0.4 m, and 0.9 m (supratidal) NAVD88. The HIME results also yielded a time series of net subaerial sediment accumulation, and specific locations and magnitudes of gains and losses, at scales from 30 m to delta-wide (similar to 100 km(3)) and 6 to 21 years. Average subaerial net sediment accumulation at the Wax Lake Delta (WLD) was estimated as 0.6 cm/yr during the study period. Finally, multiple linear regression models were successfully trained on the HIME elevation maps to model evolving delta island morphologies based on simple geometric factors, such as distance down-delta and position on a delta island; the models also successfully reproduced an average delta topset slope of 1.4 cm. Overall, this study's development and application of the HIME method added detailed insights to recent, transient ecogeomorphological change at the WLD, and demonstrated the potential of the new approach for accurately reconstructing past intertidal topographies and dynamic change.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,2072-4292,,,,,,,,,,"Princeton Hydro, Ringoes, NJ 08551 USAWashington State Univ, Sch Environm, Vancouver, WA 98686 USAUniv Texas Austin, Dept Geol Sci, Austin, TX 78712 USA",Princeton Hydro,,,2020-05-01,WOS:000543394000164,,

A well-defined fault-fracture mesh petroleum play usually contains three basic elements, an oil source network at the base, a transient storage for migrating hydrocarbons in the middle, and a petroleum accumulation network at the top. The oil source network provides fairways for hydrocarbons generated in a deep source to migrate vertically upward to shallow strata, often consisting of primary faults and fracture zones and/or regional unconformities in direct contact with mature petroleum source beds, and secondary faults intercepting lenticular fluvial sandstones. The transient storages for migrating hydrocarbons include the thick, porous, mat or sheet-like sandstones deposited under the fluvial, braided stream setting and occurring over relatively large geographic areas. These sandstones serve as temporary storage spaces, through which deep-sourced petroleum fluids migrate further, either laterally or vertically into shallower reservoirs. The upper petroleum accumulation network provides suitable habitats for oil and gas accumulation, comprising structural, lithologic, stratigraphic and combination traps. The Jiyang Superdepression of the Bohai Bay Basin hosts several excellent examples of the fault-fracture mesh petroleum play, where hydrocarbons in the Neogene reservoirs were derived either directly from Eocene-Oligocene source rocks, or from the redistribution of pre-existing oil accumulations in the deeper reservoirs. Reactivation of basement-involved faults and regional unconformities provided conduits for channeling the pre-Neogene hydrocarbons into the shallow strata. The magnitudes and frequencies of the faulting activities and their relative timings to those of peak oil generation and expulsion were critical factors for controlling the quantities of hydrocarbons transmitted to the Neogene strata. The thick sandstones and conglomerates in the lower Guantao Formation acted as excellent transient storages for the deep sourced oils, which were then trapped to form accumulations in the shallow structural, lithologic, stratigraphic and combination traps of the Guantao (Ng)-Minhuazhen (Nm) formations. With the recent discovery of several giant oilfields in the shallow Neogene reservoirs both onshore and offshore Bohai Bay Basin, the proposed 'fault-fracture mesh petroleum play' concept helps the exploration geologists to modify and clarify long held traditional concepts of petroleum play types in this basin, and expand upon the new exploration horizons of the shallow subtle petroleum traps.

By reducing BOM oxidation degradation at high ambient temperature [3-4], reliability of the sensor is maintained. For this study, the TV (test vehicle, Figure 1) consist of an Alumina (Al2O3) substrate casing which houses all the active components and is hermetically sealed with a Silicon (Si) die that acts as an IR filter. Laser and seam welding are common method of performing hermetic sealing but they suffer from low throughput issues. An investigative benchmark of various hermetic sealing methods and materials will be discussed in great details, targeting Alumina (Al2O3) to Silicon (Si) interfaces sealing. Both sealing surfaces have no metallization. Materials such as high temperature low outgassing adhesive, glass frit paste and ceramic paste will be applied on the TV via dispensing or screen printing method and their corresponding hermeticity performance of the sealing interface will be investigated.

This paper sets out to review natural disturbances and their effects in forests in Australia, and to determine whether or not the effects of management of forests for all of their benefits can be contained within the known effects of natural disturbance.The history and evolutionary significance of fire in Australia is reviewed, and the differing fire ecologies of two representative species, Eucalyptus regnans in the south-east (which is killed by fire and regenerates prolifically from seed after fire) and Eucalyptus marginata in the south-west (which survives all but the most severe fires and regenerates from both shoots and seeds) are outlined. The development of E. regnans following stand-replacing fire can be defined as highly resilient (returning quickly to the pre-disturbance state) and that of E. marginata as resistant (difficult to move from the pre-disturbance state).The topic of forest management in relation to disturbance is discussed within the context of forests of mountain ash (Eucalyptus regnans), the world's tallest flowering plant, in south-eastern Australia. These forests in their natural state are essentially even-aged or at the most include two to three age-classes, the result of regeneration following stand-replacing bushfires. They produce timber of high value, and cuffent land planning and management prescriptions allow for about one-half of the forest area to be managed for timber production on a sustained-yield basis. The silvicultural system is clear-felling, followed by burning to give stand-replacing conditions. Mountain ash regenerating from this system is one of the fastest growing tree species in the world and at its best has a volume increment of 50 m3 ha-1 year-1 and net primary production of 35 t ha-1 year-1 over the first 10 years. There is no definitive evidence of a loss of diversity of plant species in timber production forests. The greatest problem is to manage land for timber production and for the diversity of fauna which depend on nesting hollows in large dead or living trees. However, all of the species found in older forests can be found in regrowth forests which have been burned or logged over the past 50 years and which include large dead or living trees with nesting hollows.Them has been speculation that harvesting mountain ash forests by clearfelling and regenerating them following slash-burning will lead to a loss of nutrients and a consequent loss of productivity. Nutrient cycling in mountain ash is shown to be resilient to disturbance. Rapid uptake of nutrients by the regenerating forest, immobilization of nutrients by microorganisms, and increased rates of nitrogen fixation are processes which lead to the conservation of nutrients following stand-replacing fires. There is no evidence of productivity decline following bushfire or timber harvesting.Another concern about forest harvesting is that there will be a reduction in carbon storage. The break-even point for E. regnans plantations yielding short-lived products (e.g. paper) is 3 7 years and for E. regnans forests grown for sawn timber, 60 years. Harvesting forests on rotations of 80-120 years will therefore result in an increase in carbon storage; however, it would take several rotations to restore carbon storage equivalent to that of old-age forest.Much of the literature on disturbance illustrates the difficulties of dealing with traditional and sometimes deeply entrenched concepts of how plant communities develop and the nature of the end-state of development. Development of mountain ash forest fits within Egler's model of initial floristic composition; there is no stable and self-perpetuating end-point, the climax is probably no more than the state where species change is immeasurably slow, and maximum diversity and productivity are maintained by random periodic disturbance. Does this set of conclusions provide the basis for management of the forest? The management of diversity in heath is discussed as an example; the issue is less contentious than in forests since no commercial product is harvested. Coastal heath on soils of poor fertility in Victoria also follows the model of initial floristic composition; diversity and productivity are maintained by fire, decreasing markedly within 20-50 years of disturbance. Management can use fire to maintain a mosaic of regenerated heathland to accommodate the range of responses of fauna and flora to disturbance, thereby maximizing diversity.The solution of maintaining diversity through an intermediate level of disturbance is well-established in the ecological literature; through disturbance, an equilibrium is never reached and higher diversity is maintained. In the managed forest, management dictates the disturbance regime (frequency, size and intensity) which must be fined to the attributes, or life histories, of the organisms to be managed.This paper presents the view that timber harvesting in Australian forests is ecologically sustainable and that the effects of management can be contained within the framework of those caused by natural disturbance. Given that each plot in the forest differs from all other plots and that none is at steady state, a solution for the management of diversity is to use the whole of the forest estate (parks, stream reserves, catchment reserves, old-age forest, forests of different ages resulting from past fires and logging) so that diversity of the estate, rather than diversity of each plot, is maximized.",,,,,,,,,140,0,0,0,72,0,144,,,0378-1127,1872-7042,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1994-02-01,WOS:A1994MY56500011,,

A 30-y time-series of very high resolution false colour aerial photographs was studied for eight saltmarsh sites in the Westerschelde estuary (southwest Netherlands). Detailed maps of vegetation cover were produced for each year, based on a supervised classification, and changes in vegetation cover were analysed in a geographical information system.The results of the vegetation change maps and complementary series of topographic surveys have shown evidence of saltmarsh cycles, but without spatial synchrony in these cycles for the Westerschelde. For each saltmarsh, a different status of net erosion or accretion was found. Within each saltmarsh, there were both areas with vegetation loss and with vegetation expansion in each period. Most saltmarshes showed a simultaneous expansion of Spartina anglica by tussock growth, and a lateral retreat of the saltmarsh plateau through undercutting of a cliff at the edge of this plateau, resulting in saltmarsh rejuvenation. The rate of lateral retreat of the saltmarsh plateau decreased with the establishment of pioneer vegetation in front of the cliff (probably through dissipation of wave and tidal energy caused by the friction associated with the pioneer vegetation), and was generally not related to the frequency of high magnitude tides and high magnitude onshore winds. For the saltmarsh site that showed severe lateral erosion, a relationship with the mudflat topography was found, with lateral retreat of the saltmarsh plateau being compensated by an increase in mudflat elevation, eventually slowing down the erosion rate, and facilitating the subsequent expansion of pioneer vegetation in front of the cliff.The study demonstrates the significance of intrinsic processes in saltmarsh development, and the necessity to consider the local feedback mechanisms between plant growth, morphology and hydrodynamics of both the saltmarsh and the mudflat, when assessing the status of saltmarshes. It also shows the importance of assessing the changes in saltmarsh area in a spatial context, rather than looking at changes in total area of saltmarsh vegetation. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Recent analyses found a large C uptake anomaly in 2011 in arid and semiarid regions of the southern hemisphere. Consequently, we compared C and water fluxes of two distinct woody ecosystems (a Mulga (Acacia) woodland and a Corymbia savanna) between August 2012 and August 2014 in semiarid central Australia, demonstrating that the 2011 anomaly was short-lived in both ecosystems. The Mulga woodland was approximately C neutral but with periods of significant uptake within both years. The extreme drought tolerance of Acacia is presumed to have contributed to this. By contrast, the Corymbia savanna was a very large net C source (130 and 200 g C m(-2) yr(-1) in average and below average rainfall years, respectively), which is likely to have been a consequence of the degradation of standing, senescent biomass that was a legacy of high productivity during the 2011 anomaly. The magnitude and temporal patterns in ecosystem water-use efficiencies (WUE), derived from eddy covariance data, differed across the two sites, which may reflect differences in the relative contributions of respiration to net C fluxes across the two ecosystems. In contrast, differences in leaf-scale measures of WUE, derived from C-13 stable isotope analyses, were apparent at small spatial scales and may reflect the different rooting strategies of Corymbia and Acacia trees within the Corymbia savanna. Restrictions on root growth and infiltration by a siliceous hardpan located below Acacia, whether in the Mulga woodland or in small Mulga patches of the Corymbia savanna, impedes drainage of water to depth, thereby producing a reservoir for soil moisture storage under Acacia while acting as a barrier to access of groundwater by Corymbia trees in Mulga patches, but not in the open Corymbia savanna.

The validation of complex numerical models through scale model experimental testing is restricted by the physical limits of the test facilities. It is not feasible to install the equivalent full length mooring lines and riser systems and select an appropriate scale model for reducing the uncertainties in the experimental test programme for deepwater and ultra-deepwater conditions. The combination of an appropriate scale FPSO model with a suitable level of equivalent effect reduced depth using a hybrid passive truncated experimental methodology for the mooring lines and risers is a practical approach.Following recent discoveries, FPSO has been proposed for a portion of the planned development in the southern Gulf of Mexico (GOM) in water depth ranging from 1000 to 2000 m. Based on a scale model and a hybrid passive truncated experimental method for mooring lines and risers, this paper investigates the global response of an FPSO, as well as the dynamics of mooring lines and risers in the context of prevailing environmental conditions for field development in a specific deepwater location in GOM. The experiments revealed that the main horizontal motion response of the FPSO (surge) under non-collinear loading condition is almost two-times that of the collinear loading condition. The mooring lines in the non-collinear condition are more sensitive to the dynamic response and risers appear to have an important influence on the low frequency damping.",,,,,,,,,17,1,0,0,2,0,17,,,0029-8018,,,,,,,,,,,"Newcastle Univ, Sch Marine Sci & Technol, Newcastle Upon Tyne NE1 7RU, Tyne & Wear, EnglandShanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Shanghai 200240, Peoples R ChinaPEP, Marina Nacl 329C, Cd Mexico 11300, Mexico",PEP,,,2017-03-08,WOS:000393241300045,,

Therefore, the characterization of the natural fracture network originated from the complex multi-tectonic events of this area remains challenging. This contribution presents a 4D innovative approach for improving the geomechanics-based assessment of fault-related fractures in such exigent environment. The workflow consists of several steps to reduce uncertainties in the fractured reservoir modeling, both in estimating (i) the paleo-geometry of the main structures using 3D reconstruction techniques and (ii), the paleo-tectonic stresses using fracture-based stress inversion technology, both steps being essential to comprehensive geomechanical simulations through geological time.This acute fractured reservoir characterization workflow was therefore applied in a field development plan in the Malay Basin, offshore Malaysia. Well data analysis, refined seismic interpretations, 2D/3D structural restorations and paleo-stress inversions were integrated to manage uncertainties in the discrete fracture simulation. The model reveals evidences of two successive tectonic events: a Paleogene extension with a normal-slip fault regime (sigma(H) = > N66 degrees) and a Neogene contraction with a strike-slip fault regime (sigma(H) = > N174 degrees). This tectonic inversion is associated with a redirection of the far field stress, as well asthe location and orientation of the natural fracture network during its growth. The proposed workflow improves the understanding of the fractured reservoir characterization greatly and is of help to appraise future development plans better.",,,,,,,,,14,1,0,0,0,0,15,,,0264-8172,1873-4073,,,,,,,,,,"Schlumberger, Montpellier, FrancePETRONAS, Kuala Lumpur, MalaysiaSchlumberger, Aachen, GermanySchlumberger Boston, Boston, MA USAYouWol Montpellier, Montpellier, France",PETRONASSchlumbergerSchlumberger BostonYouWol Montpellier,,,2019-06-14,WOS:000469896400014,,

Positive hydraulic fracture stimulation results, along with the presence of many untested, off-structure stratigraphic traps, indicate there is a large potential for future tight gas development in the basin.Extracting value from these complex set of reservoirs needs the use of state of the art technologies. Many companies have recognized that this theme requires the Asset Team project management methodology wherein geologists, geophysicists, engineers, log analysts, and other professionals come together to combine their skills and insight to better understand, measure and predict reservoir properties in low permeability reservoirs and to use that information in resource evaluation, reservoir characterization and management.This manuscript describes how such a multidisciplinary asset team approach was used to determine the petrography, reservoir and petrophysical properties of the tight gas reservoirs in the Thrace Basin Turkey. Geological details and detailed core studies were integrated into petrophysical analyses, along with mud logs to identify the unconventional pay zones for executing hydraulic fracture stimulation in the area. As a result, stimulations were designed to avoid frequent interlaced water-bearing sand stringers and resulted in numerous successful recompletions of the existing wells, drilling of vertical and horizontal wells with increasing recoverable reserve by over 40 Billion Standard Cubic Feet (BCF) in proved reserves during a 2 year project.

Following the Deepwater Horizon oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico, concerns were raised that PAH-degrading V. parahaemolyticus could increase in abundance, leading to elevated risks of disease derived from shellfish consumption. To assess this possibility, we examined responses to naphthalene and phenanthrene of 17 coastal Louisiana environmental V. parahaemolyticus isolates representing five distinct genotypes. Isolates were obtained immediately after the spill began and after oil had reached the Louisiana coast. None of the isolates grew on or oxidized either substrate and a naphthalene degradation product, 1-naphthol, substantially inhibited growth of some isolates. The use of PAH by V. parahaemolyticus is unusual, and an increase in human health risks due to stimulation of V. parahaemolyticus growth by oil-derived PAH under in situ conditions appears unlikely.

Here we show that a decline of 0.20.1PgC yr(-1) in fire emissions during 2008-2014 relative to 2001-2007 also induced an additional carbon sink enhancement of 0.4 +/- 0.2PgC yr(-1) attributable to carbon cycle feedbacks, amounting to a combined sink increase comparable to the 0.6PgC yr(-1) budget imbalance.

Recent studies have suggested that anaerobic decay levels of wood in landfills are low, although knowledge of the decay of individual wood species is limited. The objective of this study was to establish the extent of carbon loss for wood species of commercial importance in Australia including radiata pine, blackbutt, spotted gum and mountain ash. Experiments were conducted under laboratory conditions designed to simulate optimal anaerobic biodegradation in a landfill. Bacterial degradation, identified by both light microscopy and electron microscopy, occurred to a varying degree in mountain ash and spotted gum wood. Fungal decay was not observed in any wood samples. Mountain ash, the species with the highest methane yield (20.9 mL CH4/g) also had the highest holocellulose content and the lowest acid-insoluble lignin and extractive content. As the decay levels for untreated radiata pine were very low, it was not possible to determine whether impregnation of radiata pine with chemical preservatives had any impact on decay. Carbon losses estimated from gas generation were below 5% for all species tested. Carbon losses as estimated by gas generation were lower than those derived by mass balance in most reactors, suggesting that mass loss does not necessarily equate to carbon emissions. There was no statistical difference between decay of blackbutt derived from plantation and older, natural forests. Addition of paper as an easily digestible feedstock did not increase carbon loss for the two wood species tested and the presence of radiata pine had an inhibitory effect on copy paper decay. Although differences between some of the wood types were found to be statistically significant, these differences were detected for wood with carbon losses that did not exceed 5%. The suggested factor for carbon loss for wood in landfills in Australia is 1.4%. This study confirms that disposal of wood in landfills in Australia results in long-term storage of carbon, with only minimal conversion of carbon to gaseous end products. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

The sandstones form a major gas condensate reservoir stratigraphically trapped against the Fladen Ground Spur. Although the first-order architecture is a simple northwards-thinning wedge, the lower part of the reservoir has a high degree of internal heterogeneity. The presence of thick debrites interleaved with or replacing sandstone units suggests that large-scale remobilisation has significantly impacted the sandstone distribution. This paper aims to reconstruct the style, geometry and history of the remobilisation over a 20 km(2), densely drilled area of the Britannia Field, focussing on the lower reservoir interval where remobilisation is thought to be prevalent. The study is based on documentation of approximately 2000 ft (610 m) of high quality core from 11 wells, together with wireline data from an additional 26 wells. Two main phases of remobilisation are recognised, each associated with excision surfaces removing up to 45 m of previously deposited stratigraphy. These surfaces are overlain by debrites that can be an order of magnitude thinner than the inferred excision depths, so that up to 40 m of differential topography was created as a consequence of the remobilisation. Subsequent sandstone intervals are shown to heal this differential topography, giving rise to a simple layer-like, large-scale architecture despite the complex internal remobilisation-induced heterogeneity. Remobilisation has thus affected the sand-body geometry both by removing previously deposited sand intervals and by controlling the thickness distribution of subsequent sandstones. Integration of the model with data from uncored wells shows that spatial variability may in some areas occur on distances smaller than current core-spacing (450 m), diminishing the geometric predictive value of the model in these areas. The fully mixed nature of the debrites is interpreted to indicate efficient transformation of the remobilised mass into a debris flow, controlling the highly evacuated morphology of the failure area. This link between morphology and process is used to characterise the Britannia remobilisation morphotype and place it into existing mass wasting classifications. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Petroleum activity in these areas is challenging due to harsh weather conditions, darkness, ice, large distances and lack of infrastructure. The politically controversial nature of Arctic oil and gas exploitation makes improvements in oil spill response a necessary condition to receive a license to operate for the oil industry. This paper analyzes the characteristics and development of the Norwegian oil spill response systems in the light of the northwards expansion of the petroleum industry. It addresses the Norwegian case from a pan-Arctic perspective, and looks at the different scales at which emergency response networks are organized. The preparedness theme turns out to be a meeting point for environmental and business interests and provides opportunities for innovation and economic development. Despite ongoing developments and improvements, the paper discusses the challenges ahead in Arctic oil spill preparedness. These should be addressed from a local, state and international level simultaneously, involving public institutions, private companies, and public-private constellations. While implementation takes place at the national and local level, the Arctic Council has a potentially important role in harmonizing standards and regulations across Arctic countries.

Rural decline is defined as comprising loss of rural youth, reduced human capital and increasing rural poverty. Since the start of the current century, the unconventional natural gas industry has been expanding around the world, often in close proximity to pre-existing agricultural communities. The social impacts of this new industry represent a growing area of interest in rural studies. We contribute to this new research area through a case study of coal seam gas (CSG) development in Queensland, Australia, comparing regions where gas development occurred between 2001 and 2011 against a control group of similar regions without gas development. The study eliminated the influence of non-resident workforces by analysing census data based on place of usual residence as well as place of enumeration. A key finding of the study is that regions with CSG development have experienced a growing youth share of the population and, of particular note, a growing female youth share of the population. CSG regions had a higher proportion of youth with university degrees and advanced technical training compared to other rural regions. Poverty reduction was also observed in some specific CSG regions. The extensive spatial footprint of unconventional gas and increased female rural youth populations indicate a diversion from traditional boomtown social impacts observed in previous energy booms. Taken together, the results show signs of mitigating and reversing rural community decline. (C) 2014 CSIRO.

Sabella D10 is a 1 MW tidal turbine fully submerged and laid on the seabed with a horizontal axis and 6 blades. It is the first French tidal turbine producing electricity and connected to the electrical network. As tidal turbines are emerging technologies, the demonstration of the power performance in real conditions is vital for designers. Currently, few full scale prototypes have been tested at sea and even less have been integrated into the electricity grid. Due to this context, the standard IEC62600-200 Electricity producing tidal energy converter-power performance assessment has been applied only on a limited number of turbines and, as a consequence, industrials have a limited feedback on the use of the IEC62600-200.The aim of this paper is to detail the IEC62600-200 requirements for the power performance assessment, and the application case on the tidal turbine Sabella D10. The technical specification IEC62600-200 was issued in 2013 and describes the procedure for the power perfonuance assessment of the tidal converters. This technical specification gives requirements for the site and test conditions, the measurement procedures and their exploitation to obtain the power curves. Finally, the reporting foituat of the results, is detailed to provide a complete document to the certification body. In the framework of the project Sabella D10, funded by ADEME, the power curves of the tidal turbine prototype D10 of Sabella have been established in cooperation with Sabella and Bureau Veritas according to IEC62600-200. They worked together for the interpretation of the technical specification, the exploitation of the measurements and the presentation of the results.The global procedure of IEC has been followed however some adaptations have been made to take into account the Sabella D10 specifics and site characteristics. Indeed, the Sabella D10 project started before the IEC62600-200 publication and some requirements have not been anticipated at the beginning of the project. The first objective of this analysis is to challenge the IEC methodology with an analysis of a real set of production data and to demonstrate the applicability of the technical specification. Additionally, the assumptions and the deviation with the IEC will be presented and some improvements of the standard will be proposed in conclusion.",,,,,"35th ASME International Conference on Ocean, Offshore and Arctic Engineering35th ASME International Conference on Ocean, Offshore and Arctic Engineering","JUN 19-24, 2016JUN 19-24, 2016","ASME, Ocean Offshore & Arctic Engn DivASME, Ocean Offshore & Arctic Engn Div","Busan, SOUTH KOREABusan, SOUTH KOREA",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,978-0-7918-4997-2,,,,,,,,,"Bur Veritas, Marine & Offshore Div, Nantes, FranceSabella, Quimper, France",Bur VeritasSabella,,,2017-03-01,WOS:000393090900030,,

After mid-Jurassic collision of the Siberian and Chinese cratons. a latitudinal system of post-collision troughs developed along the Mongol-Okhotsk suture (the Uda, Torom basins and others), filled with terrigenous coal-bearing molasse.The dispersion of Pangea. creation of oceans during the Late Jurassic are correlated to the emergence of the East Asian submeridional rift system with volcano-terrigenous coal-bearing deposits (the Amur-Zeya basin). At that time, to the east there existed an Andean-type continental margin. Foreland (Upper Bureya, Partizansk, and Razdolny) and flexural (Sangjiang-Middle Amur) basins were formed along the margin of the rigid massifs during the Late Jurassic to Berriasian.During the Valanginian-mid-Albian an oblique subduction of the Izanagi plate beneath the Asian continent occurred, producing a transform margin type, considerable sinistral strike slip displacements, and formation of pull-apart basins filled with turbidites (the Sangjiang-Middle Amur basin).The Aptian is characterized by plate reorganization and formation of epioceanic island arcs, fore-arc and back-arc basins in Sakhalin and the Sikhote-Alin (the Alchan and Sangjiang-Middle Amur basins), filled with volcanoclastics.During the mid-Albian a series of terranes accreted to the Asian continental margin. By the end of the Albian, the East Asian marginal volcanic belt began to form due to the subduction of the Kula plate beneath the Asian continent. During the Cenomanian-Coniacian shallow marine coarse clastics accumulated in the fore-arc basins, which were followed by continental deposits in the Santonian-Campanian. From the Coniacian to the Maastrichtian, a thermal subsidence started in rift basins, and continental oil-bearing clastics accumulated (the Amur-Zeya basin).Widespread elevation and denudation were dominant during the Maastrichtian. This is evidenced by thick sediments accumulated in the Western Sakhalin fore-arc basin.During the Cenozoic, an extensive rift belt rmade up of a system of grabens, which were filled with lacustrine-alluvial coal-and oil-bearing deposits, developed along the East Asian margin.

An optimization problem was mathematically formulated to provide the optimal thrust allocation by introducing the corresponding design variables, objective function, and constraints. A hybrid optimization algorithm consisting of a genetic algorithm and a sequential quadratic programming (SQP) algorithm was selected and used to solve this problem.

To address the societal aspects of the low-carbon energy transition, we need to appreciate that our future depends on protecting the Earth's atmosphere. By reviewing the discovery of the greenhouse gas effect over the last 200 years, we establish the essential motivation for changing human behaviour with regard to energy use. From this basis, we consider the challenge of how to achieve this energy transition or, more specifically, how to overcome the dissonances related to societal acceptance, economic hurdles and lack of progress with deployment of low-carbon energy options. The last decade has seen a significant growth in the renewable energy and natural gas sectors: however, CCS has made limited progress.

The objectives of this work were to investigate the response of biomass C and soil organic carbon (SOC) densities to the age of these forest plantations and to determine their contribution to the C sources/sink within these regional forest ecosystems. In this project three different species of plants, Caragana korshinskii Kom., Hippophae rhamnoides and Prunus davidiana (Carr.) Franch, were studied by selecting 3 plantation areas where each plant had grown for 9-years and 3 separate plantation areas where each plant had grown for 26-years. All three of these species Were widely planted in the case study area. A total of 54 quadrants (2 m x 2 m) were randomly selected in 18 plots (3 plots for each species x 3 species x 2 stand ages) from these plantations for measuring the above and below-ground biomass as well as the biomass C concentration and density of the three species. A bucket auger was used to collect soil samples from 0 to 100 cm soil depth to determine the SOC concentration and density in each plot. Biomass density, biomass C and SOC increased with growth between 9 and 26 years for all three plant species. The biomass densities for P. davidiana, C. korshinskii and H. rhamnoides increased from 27.3 +/- 7.5 to 49.9 +/- 11.9 Mg ha(-1), 16.6 +/- 3.8 to 39.0 +/- 18.2 MgC ha(-1), and 14.4 +/- 4.4 to 23.7 +/- 5.7 Mg ha(-1), respectively. The biomass C for P. davidiana, C. korshinskii and H. rhamnoides also increased during this time from 9.5 +/- 2.6 to 18.7 +/- 4.1 Mg ha(-1), 6.2 +/- 1.1 to 14.6 +/- 6.6 Mg ha(-1), and 6.2 +/- 1.9 to 8.5 +/- 2.0 Mg ha(-1), respectively. Similarly, the SOC for P. davidiana, C. korshinskii and H. rhamnoides during this time increased from 114.1 +/- 13.9 to 185.4 +/- 21.2 Mg ha(-1), 80.0 +/- 9.0 to 93.3 +/- 10.7 Mg ha(-1), and 62.4 +/- 3.5 to 81.6 +/- 15.4 Mg ha(-1), respectively. Significant differences (P < 0.05) were found for the biomass C and SOC densities between the 9- and 26-year old plantations, demonstrating that biomass production continued to significantly impact the SOC storage with increasing age of the forest plantations investigated. This work suggested that both the stored biomass C and SOC in these plantations did not decrease during the growth period from 9- to 26-years.

Inland and coastal wetlands (specifically boreal, temperate and tropical peatlands; tundra; floodplains; freshwater marshes; saltmarshes; and mangroves) are among the most efficient natural long-term carbon sinks. Yet, they also release methane (CH4) that can offset the carbon they sequester. Here, we conducted a meta-analysis on wetland carbon dynamics to (i) determine their impact on climate using different metrics and time horizons, (ii) investigate the cost-effectiveness of wetland restoration for climate change mitigation, and (iii) discuss their suitability for inclusion in climate policy as negative emission technologies. Depending on metrics, a wetland can simultaneously be a net carbon sink (i.e. boreal and temperate peatlands net ecosystem carbon budget = -28.1 +/- 19.13 gC m(-2) y(-1)) but have a net warming effect on climate at the 100 years time-scale (i.e. boreal and temperate peatland sustained global warming potential = 298.2 +/- 100.6 gCO(2) eq(-1) m(-2) y(-1)). This situation creates ambivalence regarding the effect of wetlands on global temperature. Moreover, our review reveals high heterogeneity among the (limited number of) studies that document wetland carbon budgets. We demonstrate that most coastal and inland wetlands have a net cooling effect as of today. This is explained by the limited CH4 emissions that undisturbed coastal wetlands produce, and the long-term carbon sequestration performed by older inland wetlands as opposed to the short lifetime of CH4 in the atmosphere. Analysis of wetland restoration costs relative to the amount of carbon they can sequester revealed that restoration is more cost-effective in coastal wetlands such as mangroves (US$1800 ton C-1) compared with inland wetlands (US$4200-49 200 ton C-1). We advise that for inland wetlands, priority should be given to conservation rather than restoration; while for coastal wetlands, both conservation and restoration may be effective techniques for climate change mitigation.",,,,,,,,,71,0,0,0,36,0,74,,,2042-8898,2042-8901,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Quebec Montreal Geotop, Montreal, PQ, CanadaUniv Sydney, Sydney Southeast Asia Ctr, Sydney, NSW, AustraliaMonash Univ, Sch Social Sci, Clayton, Vic, AustraliaNatl Univ Singapore, Dept Geog, Singapore, Singapore",Univ Quebec Montreal Geotop,,,2020-10-06,WOS:000562794000001,32832065,

This study addresses the effect of Corexit on oil biodegradation by alkane and/or aromatic degrading bacterial culture in artificial seawater at different dispersant to oil ratios (DORs). Our results show that dispersant addition did not enhance oil biodegradation. At DOR 1:20, biodegradation was inhibited, especially when only the alkane degrading culture was present. With a combination of cultures, this inhibition was overcome after 10 days. This indicates that initial inhibition of oil biodegradation can be overcome when different bacteria are present in the environment. We conclude that the observed inhibition is related to the enhanced dissolution of aromatic compounds into the water, inhibiting the alkane degrading bacteria. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Reliable model testing in deep water basins requires the controlled modeling of current and wave in time and space to achieve a well-defined offshore environment. Current generation is considered to be one of the key challenges for the design and construction of a physical deep water test basin. Apart from the physical setup, a virtual numerical wave basin is an integral part of the whole facility. Among others, accurate representation of current generation is an indispensable component of the numerical package in order to achieve an accurate numerical simulation of wave and current. In OpenFOAM, the density is not considered in turbulence formulations for two phase flow (Jacobsen, 2012 and Harrif, 2013) where free surface is considered. Thus excessive diffusion of turbulence takes place over the interface, which results in poor results of velocity profiles and turbulence quantities for current generation. In this paper, standard k - epsilon, realizable k - epsilon and SST k - omega turbulence models have been correctly formulated by taking into account the effect of density according to the references (Jones and Launder, 1972; Shih et al., 1994; Hellsten, 1997) and implemented in OpenFOAM two phase flow solver. The velocity profile and turbulence quantities have been calculated and validated against the data by Klopman (1994) using the modified turbulence models. The validation reveals that correctly formulated k - epsilon, realizable k - epsilon and SST k - omega turbulence models yield better agreement, as compared to the existing models in OpenFOAM, with experimental data in terms of current profile and turbulence quantities. The numerical model is then applied to simulate the generation of a three-layer current system. The turbulence intensity and shear velocity profile are presented.",,,,,"34th ASME International Conference on Ocean, Offshore and Arctic Engineering (OMAE2015)34th ASME International Conference on Ocean, Offshore and Arctic Engineering (OMAE2015)","MAY 31-JUN 05, 2015MAY 31-JUN 05, 2015","Amer Soc Mech Engn, Ocean Offshore & Arct Engn DivAmer Soc Mech Engn, Ocean Offshore & Arct Engn Div","St John's, CANADASt John's, CANADA",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,978-0-7918-5649-9,,,,,,,,,"Lloyds Register Global Technol Ctr, 1 Fusionopolis Way,Connexis North Tower 17-14, Singapore 138632, SingaporeASTAR, Inst High Performance Comp, Singapore 138632, SingaporeNatl Univ Singapore, Dept Mech Engn, Singapore 117575, Singapore",Lloyds Register Global Technol Ctr,,,2016-08-03,WOS:000379707000014,,

This comparison shows that the decrease of the atmospheric CO2 concentration is accompanied by a carbon transfer from the continental biosphere to the oceanic deep waters. At the glacial maximum this transfer is estimated to be about 500 GtC (1 GtC=10(15) g of carbon) equivalent to 25% of the carbon storage of the biosphere. It occurs mainly in the high latitudes of the Southern Hemisphere by incorporation of CO2 into particulate matter during photosynthesis. It is shown that the mean oceanic productivity does not increase with a supplementary supply of ions such as phosphate (PO43-) or nitrate (NO3-) but that the intensity of the thermohaline circulation is certainly reduced. As the warming up of the oceans and the melting of the ice-sheet begin carbon transfer takes place to restore the continental biosphere.Another carbon transfer of a much more important intensity is also at work in the sea shore environment. Its intensity could be sufficient to renew the entire carbon of the continental biospheric, atmospheric and oceanic reservoirs in a length of time comparable to a glacial cycle. This fact shows the importance of studying the deposition of carbon in oceanic zones which are uncovered with drops in sea level. At the present time data on the coastal environment in relation to the global carbon cycle are very scarce and warrants more research in this area.",,,,,,,,,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,,,0169-8095,1873-2895,,,,,,,,,,"CNRS 354, Lab Aerol, Unite Rech Associee, F-31062 Toulouse, France",,,,1993-12-01,WOS:000208525700006,,

A methodology for calibrating tonal click detectors in small tanks consisting of the determination of the horizontal directivity pattern and detection thresholds including a transfer function is presented. Two approaches were tested to determine detection thresholds by (a) determining the 50% detection threshold and (b) fitting a linear regression model to the recorded relative amplitudes. The tests were carried out on C-PODs (Cetacean PODs, tonal click detectors), the most commonly used instrument for SAM in Europe. Directivity and threshold were tested between 60 and 150 kHz. Directivity showed a maximum variation of 8.5 dB in the horizontal plane. Sensitivity is highest between 80 and 130 kHz and linear (+/-3 dB) in this frequency range for most of the instruments tested.

In Houston, five 500-year floods have hit in the last five years according to current Federal Emergency Management Agency's (FEMA) flood risk designations. Every government from local to federal is challenged with building cities and communities resilient to changing environmental circumstances. This project investigates how local engineers, developers, industry representatives, and public officials involved in infrastructure development navigate these changing conditions in the development of flood mitigation plans. In addition to providing funding for the training of a graduate student in anthropology in the methods of empirical, scientific data collection and analysis, the project would enhance scientific understanding by broadly disseminating its findings to organizations invested in developing more effective methods for communicating science and the scientific method in disaster and flood mitigation planning. The research project investigates environmental impact and response at a central node in the oil and gas industry, Houston, Texas. The major metropolitan city and its industrial infrastructure is uniquely vulnerable to sea level rise, coastal erosion, and increasingly devastating storms. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) measures current sea level rise at the mouth of the Houston Ship Channel as higher than almost anywhere else in the world. The research will include twelve months of ethnographic fieldwork (including participant-observation and semi-structured interviews as well as mapping exercises) in Houston examining public and private sector stakeholders roles in flood infrastructure planning. As threats of intensified flooding loom, how do these stakeholders negotiate entangled fears of social, economic, and environmental disasters? Through qualitative and spatial analysis of ethnographic and archival evidence of flood infrastructure preparations, this research explores the dichotomy between symbolism and expertise where scientific knowledge, public narrative, and vested interest may influence sharply different approaches in infrastructural planning. This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,1947411,,,,,,,,Stanford University,,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:15127484,,

However, these recoveries are not only difficult and expensive, but also require the development of new technologies and materials that can meet stringent requirements regarding operation in sub-surface environment. The emergence of expandable tubular in the late 1990s has opened a new avenue for oil and gas wells design and remediation processes. However, these tubular go through large expansion in diameter at kilometers depths in onshore and offshore wells. This alters the post expansion mechanical and microstructural properties of the tubular that may lead to premature failure during operation. The idea of understanding such variations revolve around complex mechanisms occurring at micro level including multiphase microstructure, grains sizes and morphology, and crystallographic orientations. Initial grains morphology and distribution of phases, and the subsequent changes due to the expansion process lead to significant variations in material properties at macro level. Optical micrographs showed that the expandable tubular material is composed of fine grained microstructure of ferrite phase with some traces of martensite and plate-like structures. Induced martensite results from the phase transformation of metastable austenite induced by thermomechanical processing applied during the manufacturing stage. A reasonable presence of martensite phase in the tubular material enhances its structural integrity, collapse and burst strengths, as well as provides a safeguard against possible mechanical failures such as buckling. On the other hand, the ferrite phase is a soft phase and its presence improves the formability of the tubular resulting in higher expansion ratio. It was also observed that the grains size is affected by the tubular expansion. The presence of elongated grains in the microstructure is due to the excessive deformation as well as the crystallographic reorientation of grains due to the course of tubular expansion. However, no strong texture has been found in the expanded tubular material, which may be attributed to the complex nature of loadings induced during the expansion process. In order to understand the influence of tubular expansion process on mechanical properties of tubular, samples from un-expanded and expanded sections of the tubular (expanded at 16%, 20% and 24% of the tubular original inner diameter) are investigated using standard mechanical testing procedures. Mechanical testing results revealed an increase in yield strength, ultimate tensile strength and hardness, whereas ductility and impact toughness tend to decrease. Fracture surface analysis of fractured tensile samples has also been done using scanning electron microscope (SEM). At lower expansion ratio, fracture surface micrographs revealed a predominantly ductile nature of failure with clusters of fine microscopic dimples intermingled with voids. However, at higher expansion ratio, the test specimens revealed a mixed mode of failure with both brittle and ductile features.",,,,,ASME International Mechanical Engineering Congress and Exposition (IMECE2015)ASME International Mechanical Engineering Congress and Exposition (IMECE2015),"NOV 13-19, 2015NOV 13-19, 2015",ASMEASME,"Houston, TXHouston, TX",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,978-0-7918-5752-6,,,,,,,,,"Sultan Qaboos Univ, Coll Engn, Muscat, Oman",,,,2016-09-02,WOS:000379791500035,,

The population of Matsu totals 11,196 and is chiefly concentrated on Nangan and Beigan. From 1971 to 2000, Matsu built five oil-fired power plants with a total installed capacity of 47 MW. However, the emissions and noise generated by the oil-fired power plant has caused damage to Matsu's environment, and the cost of fuel is high due to the long-distance shipping from Taiwan. Developing renewable energy in Matsu has therefore been a fervent topic for the Taiwan government, and tidal power is considered to be of the highest priority due to Matsu's large tidal range (4.29 m in average) and its semidiurnal tide. Moreover, the islands of Nangan and Beigan are composed of granite and have natural harbors, rendering them ideal places for coastal engineering of tidal power plants. This paper begins with a renewable energy reserves assessment in Matsu to determine the amount of tidal energy. Next, a tidal turbine type of the lowest cost is chosen, and then its dynamic characteristic, performance, and related design are analyzed.

In general, a decrease of microbial community richness and diversity in petroleum mining was observed, as measured by operational taxonomic unit (OTU) numbers, alpha (Chao1 and Shannon indices), and beta (principal coordinate analysis) diversity. Microbial community structure was strongly affected by environmental factors at the phylum and genus levels. At the phylum level, virgin field and wellhead were dominated by Proteobacteria, while the storage tank had higher presence of Firmicutes (29.3-66.9%). Specifically, the wellhead displayed a lower presentence of Proteobacteria (48.6-53.4.0%) and a higher presence of Firmicutes (24.4-29.6%) than the virgin field. At the genus level, the predominant genera were Ochrobactrum and Acinetobacter in the virgin field, Lactococcus and Pseudomonas in the wellhead, and Prauseria and Bacillus in the storage tank. Our study revealed that the microbial community structure was strongly affected by the surrounding environmental factors, such as temperature, oxygen content, salinity, and pH, which could be altered because of the oil production. It was observed that the various microbiomes produced surfactants, transforming the biohazard and degrading hydro-carbon.

A methodology based on DMSP (Defense Meteorological Satellite Program) nighttime light data combined with regional gas flaring volumes from National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's National Centers for Environmental Information (NOAA-NCEI) has been developed to estimate flaring emissions. This method is validated in Nigeria where individual field company data are available. The spatial distribution of CO2, CH4, NMVOCs, CO, OC, BC, SO2 and NOx is derived for the African continent for the period 1995-2010.A range of the emissions due to flaring is estimated based on the range of emission factors (EFs) for each chemical species. An average decrease in CO2 emissions of about 30% is found over Africa from 1995 to 2010, with Nigeria being the largest contributor to this reduction (up to 50%). Changes in the spatial distribution with time indicate local increases, particularly at offshore platforms, which are attributed to a lack of regulations as well as aging infrastructures in oil and gas fields.Comparisons with current inventories reveal differences in the location and magnitude of point source emissions. For chemical compounds such as NMVOCs and CH4, the ECLIPSE and EDGAR country-level values are considerably higher than the highest flaring emission estimated in this study for 2005. For species such as CO, OC, BC, SO2 and NOx the emissions provided by the ECLIPSE and EDGAR inventories are generally within the same order of magnitude as the average values found in this study, with the exception of OC, BC and SO2 in which EDGAR provides much lower emissions. These discrepancies are likely due to either differences in the methodologies used to estimate the emissions, in the values of the emission factors considered, or in the definition of flaring sector. Our current estimations suggest that BC, CH4 and CO2 flaring emissions in Africa account for 1-15% (on average 7%), 0.5-8% (on average 2%) and 8-13% (on average 11%) of African total anthropogenic emissions, respectively. The contribution of flaring to African anthropogenic emissions varies widely among countries. For example, in Nigeria the average emissions due to flaring are estimated to be as high as 18% for BC, 10% for CH4 and 50% for CO2, which is significantly greater than the continental average and highlights the importance of emissions in flaring areas.",,,,,,,,,17,0,0,0,2,0,17,,,1352-2310,1873-2844,,,,,,,,,,"Meteo France, Ctr Natl Rech Meteorol, Toulouse, FranceUniv Toulouse, CNRS, Lab Aerol, Toulouse, FranceUniv Felix Houphouet Boigny, Lab Phys Atmosphere, Abidjan, Cote IvoireUniv Sorbonne, CNRS, Lab Atmospheres Milieux Observat Spatiales, Paris, FranceNOAA, Earth Syst Res Lab, Div Chem Sci, Boulder, CO USACooperat Inst Res Environm Sci, Boulder, CO USANOAA, Earth Observat Grp, Natl Ctr Environm Informat, Boulder, CO USA",Cooperat Inst Res Environm Sci,,,2019-02-05,WOS:000456639900039,,

Centuries of drainage and logging have substantially altered the hydrology of the GDS, negatively affecting its ecosystem structure and function. To restore a seasonally flooded, saturated hydrologic regime to portions of the swamp, adjustable water control structures (WCS) were installed at strategic locations within existing drainage ditches. The objective of this study was to determine if the installation of the WCSs significantly altered the hydropatterns of two target restoration areas, resulting in hydrologic conditions comparable to nearby reference sites with desired forest communities. The water table (WT) was monitored for three years prior to WCS installation (pre-WCS) and three years after WCS installation (post-WCS). Comparison of WT data from the pre and post-WCS periods, using jurisdictional wetland criteria and empirical cumulative distribution functions (ECDFs), indicated increased saturated conditions within the target restoration areas following installation of the WCS. Paired Before-After Control-Impact (BACIP) statistical analysis revealed the WCS installation had a significant positive impact on WT levels in the target restoration areas relative to the reference sites.

The design lifetime of the flare was fifteen years; however, it manifested immature failure resulting in a reduction of its lifetime to ten years. The flare is composed of different parts where the upper flare body and wind deflector showed failure while other components were still healthy. The material used for the aforementioned failed parts was Incoloy 800H, which is a highly corrosion and high-temperature resistant steel alloy. The material was rolled up and welded together with different welding joints. The root cause of failure was identified by using chemical analysis and microstructural and mechanical characterizations. For the mechanical characterization, an optical microscope (OM) and scanning electron microscope (SEM) equipped with energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) analyses were used for the specimen extracted from the failed part in order to ensure that the material mentioned by the manufacturer demonstrated the same metallurgical properties. For the mechanical characterization, two sets of specimens were used, one close to the failure region and the other far from the failure area. The chemical analysis revealed that the material was truthfully Incoloy 800H. The mechanical examination results showed a significant reduction of mechanical properties, i.e., the ultimate tensile strength (UTS) and microhardness dropped by 44% and 41% for samples close and far from the failure regions, respectively. Careful examination of the failed parts indicated that failure mostly took place in the vicinity of the welds, in particular near the joints. Improper joint designs, as well as a number of joints being designed in tiny areas, worsened the harmful effect of the heat-affected zone (HAZ), resulting in crack nucleation in the HAZ regions. The effect of welding in a combination of harsh service conditions of flare caused further crack extension where they merged, resulting in final immature failure.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,1996-1944,,,,,,,,,,"Qatar Univ, Dept Mech & Ind Engn, Coll Engn, Doha 2713, Qatar",,,,2020-09-21,WOS:000567110100001,32756526,

Extensive grazing lands that have the potential to develop substantial woody biomass are one obvious candidate for such activities. However, such activities need to consider the possible impacts on existing grazing and the possible impacts of continuing CO2 buildup in the atmosphere and resultant climate change. We used simulation models to investigate these issues in the mulga (Acacia aneura) woodlands of southwest Queensland. The simulation results suggest that this system can be managed to act as either a net source or a net sink of greenhouse gases under current climate and CO2 and under a range of global change scenarios. The key component in determining source or sink status is the management of the woody mulga. The most effective means of permanently increasing carbon stores and hence reducing net emissions is to exclude both burning and grazing. There are combinations of management regimes, such as excluding fire with light grazing, which, on average, allows productive grazing but transient carbon storage. The effects of increased CO2 on ecosystem carbon stores were unexpected. Carbon stores increased (7-17%) with doubling Of CO2 only in those simulations where burning did not occur, but decreased when burnt. This occurred because the substantial increases in grass growth with doubling of CO2 (34-56%) enabled more fires, killing off the establishing cohorts needed to ensure continued carbon accumulation. On average, the doubling of atmospheric CO2 concentration increased grass growth by 44%, which is identical with mean literature values, suggesting that this result may be applicable in other ecosystems where fire has a similar function. A sensitivity analysis of the CO2 response of mulga showed only minor impacts. We discuss additional uncertainties and shortcomings. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Six seagrass meadows located within and near the eutrophic Kingston Harbour were investigated from October 1995 to June 1996 to determine the effects of increased eutrophication on seagrass population dynamics. The stations were sited at Fort Augusta, Old Coal Wharf (eutrophic, harbor sites), Hellshire coast (mesotrophic) and Port Royal Cays (oligotrophic). Aerial productivity, leaf turnover rate, leaf area, shoot density and total biomass of Thalassia testudinum were assessed during the period. In addition, the water quality at all the sites was monitored, using phytoplankton biomass as the primary index of water quality. These data were supplemented with water temperature, salinity, dissolved oxygen content, nutrients (nitrates + nitrites and phosphates), and light extinction coefficient data at these sites. Although there were no significant differences in labile nutrient data at the six sites, the significant difference in phytoplankton biomass confirmed previous observations of a range of water qualities. Water quality ranged from the eutrophic Kingston Harbour (>2.0 mg m(-3) chl a), to mesotrophic Hellshire Bays (0.57 +/- 0.02 mg m(-3) chl a), and the oligotrophic Port Royal Cays (0.21 +/- 0.01 mg m(-3) chl a).

Along with these well-documented changes, annual precipitation and the depth of winter snow pack also appear to be increasing along the Peninsula. These rapid changes in climate provide a unique opportunity to examine the effects of climate change on terrestrial ecosystems. Building on past work that focused on the impacts of warming and UVB on the performance of terrestrial vascular plants on the Peninsula, this project will examine how climate change alters nutrient (carbon and nitrogen) pools and cycling among plants, litter and soils in vascular-plant dominated communities, with the overall goal of predicting long-term effects on plant primary productivity. Two complementary approaches will be employed: experimental manipulation of the climate of plant communities and examining patterns in plant communities along environmental transects that represent long-term climatic gradients. In the first approach, shorter-term system responses to climate change will be examined by manipulating temperature, water availability, and UVB exposure of vascular-plant microcosms over three growing seasons. Scientists will assess how these manipulations influence plant growth and primary productivity, carbon dioxide fluxes, litter quality and decomposition, pools and turnover rates of C and N, and the structure of soil microbial and arthropod communities. These realistic environmental manipulations will allow for an accurate assessment of the effects of different future warming scenarios, as well as the effects of solar UVB. In the second approach, longer-term responses to warming will be evaluated by measuring pools of carbon and nitrogen in plants, litter and soils in plant communities along transects that represent gradients of long-term temperature regime. Analyzing the results from short-term warming manipulations in the context of patterns found along these gradients will make it possible to develop a conceptual model of warming impacts over longer time scales. The broader impacts of this project include: (1) Recruiting and training underrepresented, undergraduate students. (2) The dissemination of findings to the general public. (3) Contributing to society at large by improving our understanding of how climate change impacts plant productivity and ecosystem carbon storage. These impacts are societal concerns because they relate to crop production, as well as whether ecosystem responses to climate change will mitigate or promote continued buildups of greenhouse gases.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,230579,,,,,,,,Arizona State University,,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:13672698,,

If the data is obtained through experiments, it will consume a huge amount of money, manpower and time, and there is no suitable experiment to perform an accurate simulation. The method in this paper completely solves this problem. The method proposed in this paper can not only obtain accurate reliability and availability, but also evaluate the impact of uncertain events on system reliability during equipment operation.In production environments, failure data of a complex system are difficult to obtain due to the high cost of experiments; furthermore, using a single model to analyze risk, reliability, availability and uncertainty is a big challenge. Based on the fault tree, fuzzy comprehensive evaluation and Markov method, this paper proposed a fuzzy Markov method that takes the full advantages of the three methods and makes the analysis of risk, reliability, availability and uncertainty all in one. This method uses the fault tree and fuzzy theory to preprocess the input failure data to improve the reliability of the input failure data, and then input the preprocessed failure data into the Markov model; after that iterate and adjust the model when uncertainty events occur, until the data of all events have been processed by the model and the updated model obtained, which best reflects the system state. The wellhead connector of a subsea production system was used as a case study to demonstrate the above method. The obtained reliability index (mean time to failure) of the connector is basically consistent with the failure statistical data from the offshore and onshore reliability database, which verified the accuracy of the proposed method.",,,,,,,,,12,0,0,0,0,0,12,,,,2076-3417,,,,,,,,,,"Harbin Engn Univ, Coll Mech & Elect Engn, Harbin 150001, Peoples R ChinaOffshore Oil Engn CO LTD, Tianjin 300450, Peoples R ChinaCNOOC Res Inst CO LTD, Beijing 100028, Peoples R China",Offshore Oil Engn CO LTDCNOOC Res Inst CO LTD,,,2020-11-20,WOS:000586520600001,,

PCR-based detection and quantification of anammox bacteria are an easy, essential, and widely accessible technique used ubiquitously for studying them in many environmental niches. In this article, we make a summary on practical applications of 16S rRNA and functional gene PCR primers, including hydrazine dehydrogenase (Hzo), nitrite reductase (NirS), hydrazine synthase (Hzs), and cytochrome c biogenesis proteins (Ccs) in detection of them. PCR primer performances in both practical applications and tests in silico are also presented for comparison. For detecting general and specific anammox bacterial groups, selection of appropriate PCR primers for different environmental samples and practical application guidance on choice of appropriate primer pairs for different purposes are also offered.

The study is based on a large set of conodont samples obtained from 69 sections and outcrops. In the Ahnet Basin, the Middle and Upper Devonian rocks at the surface show a uniform thermal maturity level characterized by the CAI values of 2, which suggests maximum burial temperatures about 50 degrees C. In contrast, the Carboniferous exposures yield a wide range of CAI values from 1 to 3.5. Besides, the general tendency in maturity decreases upward in the sequence, there are anomalies related to heating by small local magmatic bodies. In the Mouydir Basin, the CAI values in the Middle and Upper Devonian outcrops range from 2 to 3.5. The pattern indicates that the majority of Middle Devonian rocks have experienced burial temperatures of about 120 degrees C, while thermal maturation of the Upper Devonian strata is clearly lower, with maximum heating temperatures about 50 degrees C at the edges of the basin. The observed thermal maturity has been mostly achieved during Late Carboniferous time, prior to the Variscan inversion, and only locally during the Mesozoic. It is a product of loading by Carboniferous overburden succession of which part is now removed, approx. 200-1300 m in the Ahnet Basin and up to 1200 m in the Mouydir Basin. The analysis of palaeotemperatures suggests an average geothermal gradient of 30 degrees C/km during Carboniferous time in the Ahnet-Mouydir area. In terms of hydrocarbon exploration the studied Devonian succession is predominantly mature for oil and gas. In contrary, the Carboniferous rocks are immature. Higher maturities are likely to occur in the subsurface. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

It includes the UK's main steel production centre; two oil refineries; two major chemicals clusters; and biofuel, cement, lime and glass manufacturers. It is part of the Energy Estuary, which includes the largest offshore windfarm underconstruction in the world; several existing and planned gas-fired power stations; and the UK's largest biomass power station - offering the potential for blue and green hydrogen production and BECCS. The UK's largest ports complex and the UK's largest Enterprise Zone underpin the area's potential for further industrial growth.The Humber benefits from the UK's most geologically understood site for potential CO2 storage under the North Sea; the deepest UK salt deposits, ideal for hydrogen storage, already utilised for onshore gas storage; and significant natural sequestration potential around the Humber Estuary.The Humber emits more CO2 than any other industrial cluster (30% more than the next largest), whilst the area is highly vulnerable to climate change through flood risk. A quarter of Humber GVA and 1 in 10 jobs depend on theseindustries, making safeguarding their competitiveness imperative.Clean growth, including achieving net zero by 2040, is therefore at the centre of the Humber's Local Industrial Strategy which is due for publication shortly.Developing HIDR is identified as a critical early action.HIDR will enable large industrial emitters, low carbon infrastructure providers and other stakeholders to develop a shared approach to achieving net zero by 2040. This will break down the UK's biggest industrial decarbonisationopportunity into manageable parts, align it with wider local clean growth plans and build consensus around the actions required. This coordinated approach will reduce the barriers to developing and connecting to low carbon infrastructure, enable the Humber to engage effectively together withGovernment on business and regulatory models, and maximise local business and community benefits from the transition.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,134007,,,,,,,,Hull City Council,Hull City Council,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:15360143,,

To protect seabirds, a rapid removal of oil is crucial and in situ burning could be an efficient method. In the present work exposure effects of oil and burn residue in different doses was studied on seabird feathers from legally hunted Common eider (Somateria mollissima) by examining changes in total weight of the feather and damages on the microstructure (Amalgamation Index) of the feathers before and after exposure. The results of the experiments indicate that burn residues from in situ burning of an oil spill have similar or larger fouling and damaging effects on seabird feathers, as compared to fresh oil.

The productivity study in this paper presents an investigation of the effect of resource configurations on on-site measures during a scaffolding operation on an actual liquefied natural gas (LNG) plant construction, which, in turn, aims for the continuous improvement of relevant worker performance. The discussion details the quantified effect of different scaffold logistics: (1)scaffolding types, (2)scaffolding dimensions, and (3)material resource types. For instance, the system scaffolding as one of the material resource types shows less time spent than the conventional scaffolding's performance (95.1-85.2=9.9min/m2) during the erection phase.

We tested for site and treatment effects on the relationships between stem, above-ground (stem, branches, foliage) and total (aboveground + roots) biomass production versus intercepted light (light use efficiency, LUE). We also estimated the additional carbon stored as a result of treatment. The sites were located in Australia (Pinus radiata), Brazil (Eucalyptus grandis x urophylla), France (Pinus pinaster), the United States in Georgia and North Carolina (Pinus taeda) and Hawaii (Eucalyptus saligna), Portugal (Eucalyptus globulus), South Africa (E. grandis), and Sweden (Picea abies). We hypothesized that site, treatment and their interaction would significantly affect LUE; however, we rejected our hypothesis because stem, aboveground and total LUE were not affected by site or treatment. The stem, aboveground and total LUE values were 1.21, 1.51, and 0.85 g MJ(-1), respectively. The total LUE value was lower than that for stem and aboveground LUE because a different population was used for the analysis (only five of the nine sites had total production data), and the total LUE relationship had a zero intercept whereas the stem and aboveground LUE relationships had a negative intercept. The average amount of additional carbon that would be stored by the irrigation, fertilization, and fertilization plus irrigation treatments was 3.9, 6.8 and 13.4 Mg CO2 equivalents ha(-1) yr(-1), respectively. These additional carbon storage estimates, based on these research studies with annual nutrient and water applications, were similar to results obtained in operational settings with less intensive nutrient applications.

After cultivated with 50 mg/L of each PAH, strain P14 removed 43% Phe, 34% Pyr and 30% BaP in 30 d. Four different hydroxyphenanthrene products derived from Phe by strain P14 (1,2,3,4-hydroxyphenanthrene) were detected using SPME-GC-MS. Strain P14 also was capable of degrading mineral oil with n-alkanes of C17 to C21 carbon chain length. Compared with glucose-grown cells. PAHs-grown cells had decreased contents of shorter-chain length fatty acids (<= C16:0), increased contents of C18:0. Me-C19:0 and disappeared odd-number carbon chain fatty acids. The contents of unsaturated C19:1, Me-C19:0 increased and C18:0 decreased in mineral oil-grown cells. At the same time, the strain P14 tended to float when cultivated in mineral oil-supplemented liquid medium. The degradation capability of P14 to alkane and PAHs and its floating characteristics will be very helpful for future's application in oil-spill bioremediation. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Reclaiming this water for beneficial use is thought to be one of the most practical solutions that can solve both environmental and water shortage problems. The feasibility of this practice depends on the ability to remove its chemical content to the levels that meets the appropriate standards. Organic compounds are probably the most difficult fraction to handle. In this paper, the discrete organic compounds and non-volatile, macromolecular organic compounds (i.e., natural organic matter-NOM) of three produced water samples from the Osage-Skiatook Environmental Research site were characterized. Two of the three produced waters had very little contribution from NOM, while one of the samples had about 23% NOM contribution to its organic matrix pool. Fluorescent spectrophotometric scans provided little differentiation among the organic quality of the produced water, while pyrolysis-GC/MS showed that the NOM characteristics of the three produced waters were distinct. Specifically, the overall halogenated content and aromaticity of the NOM were found to be possible qualifiers that distinguish produced water from the coalbed methane well from produced water from the oil well. And the specific chemical fragments that are linked to polysaccharide sources were found to be potential identifiers that distinguish produced water from the newer oil well from produced water from the older oil well. These identifiers were, however, only suggested for this preliminary study. More samples must be included to build a substantial database on produced water NOM to confirm and identify more markers.

Based on high and highest spatial resolution satellite imagery covering nearly four decades, we employed manual feature digitization as well as rate-of-change statistics automatically derived with the Digital Shoreline Analyses System (DSAS) and present oil-industry-induced river bed changes and related coastal dynamics manifested via land erosion or accretion, and thus overall changes in the appearance of the Yellow River Delta. Over the past 37 years large re-diversions led to net erosion areas with over 13 km of shoreline retreat, and net accretion areas with over 21 km of shoreline advance. The satellite data furthermore enabled an assessment of oil pump development in the delta for the past two decades, indicating a strong expansion of oil extraction activities even in two of the delta's protected nature reserves, taking place at times and locations that indicate noncompliance with national regulations. Overall, the study proves the power of satellite imagery to quantify changes in the coastal zone, and to detect industry related activities; including the monitoring of compliance to restricting regulations. It is especially the freely accessible Landsat archives, granting four decades of monitoring, which are of immeasurable value to depict the regions dynamics. With Landsat 8 already in orbit and with the up-coming launch of the Sentinel-2 satellite, the monitoring concept presented here can be continued into the future. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Consequently, the main objectives of this paper are evaluation of pore pressure and fracture gradients as well as identification of the geo-pressured zones (over-pressured) in the subsurface sedimentary section.The pore pressure and fracture gradients were evaluated using well logging data namely density, resistivity, gamma-ray and sonic logs obtained from offshore wells in Badri Field. The overburden (overburden stress) was calculated using Amoco overburden equation, while sonic and resistivity logs were used for pore pressure and fracture gradient calculations using Eaton's method.The results of this study revealed that: 1) integration of direct and indirect method can lead to adequate and accurate pore pressure modeling; 2) pore pressure regime shows over-pressured, normal pressure and subnormal horizons; 3) over-pressured zones was detected in the base of Zeit Formation, South Gharib Formation, Hammam Faraun Member and Kareem Formation, pore pressure were 10.3, 10.5, 9.3 and 9.6 ppg equivalent density in arrange; 4) Reservoirs of Hammam Faraun Member and Kareem Formation indicated Sub-normal pressure zones where pore pressure values are varying from 5.5 to 6.2 ppg for Hammam Faraun reservoir and from 5.2 to 8 ppg in Kareem Formation in equivalent density; 5) Normal pressure regime was detected in the upper part of Zeit Formation and Feiran, Sidri and Baba members, where pore pressure value was recorded as 8.7 ppg; 6) Best fitting parameter for Eaton resistivity and sonic logs are 0.9 and 1.65 respectively while for Amoco overburden empirical equations, the Amoco exponent best fit is 0.85 where the mud line density is 2.15 g/cm3.

Several methods, including thin section observations, total organic carbon (TOC) analysis, X-ray diffraction analysis, quantitative evaluations of minerals by scanning electron microscopy, major and trace-element analyses, and field emission-scanning electron microscopy, are used to investigate the effect of sedimentary environment on the type and distribution of shale lithofacies. Our research indicates that 36 types of shale lithofacies can be classified based on the TOC content, mineral composition, and sedimentary structure, of which five types are identified in the study area. The Es-3(l) shale has a high calcareousmineral content (average of 49.64%), low clay and siliceous minerals contents (averages of 19.54% and 19.02%, respectively), a high TOC content (average of 3.00 wt%), and well-developed horizontal bedding. The sedimentary environment during the deposition of the Es-3(l) shale in the Zhanhua Sag had a warm and moist climate, limited provenance, saline water, and strong reducibility. The sedimentary environment in the early stage had a drier climate, more limited provenance, higher salinity, and stronger reducibility than that in the later stage. Shale lithofacies can reflect a certain sedimentary environment and depositional process; similarly, a depositional environment controls the type and distribution of shale lithofacies.

Perturbations in atmospheric CO2 and in its isotopic ratios (delta C-13, Delta C-14) are removed by different processes acting on different timescales. We investigate these differences on timescales of up to 100 000 years in pulse-release experiments with the Bern3D-LPX Earth system model of intermediate complexity and by analytical solutions from a box model. On timescales from years to many centuries, the atmospheric perturbations in CO2 and delta(CO2)-C-13 are reduced by air-sea gas exchange, physical transport from the surface to the deep ocean, and by the land biosphere. Isotopic perturbations are initially removed much faster from the atmosphere than perturbations in CO2 as explained by aquatic carbonate chemistry. On multi-millennial timescales, the CO2 perturbation is removed by carbonate compensation and silicate rock weathering. In contrast, the delta C-13 perturbation is removed by the relentless flux of organic and calcium carbonate particles buried in sediments. The associated removal rate is significantly modified by spatial delta C-13 gradients within the ocean, influencing the isotopic perturbation of the burial flux. Space-time variations in ocean delta C-13 perturbations are captured by principal components and empirical orthogonal functions. Analytical impulse response functions for atmospheric CO2 and delta(CO2)-C-13 are provided.Results suggest that changes in terrestrial carbon storage were not the sole cause for the abrupt, centennial-scale CO2 and delta(CO2)-C-13 variations recorded in ice during Heinrich stadials HS1 and HS4, though model and data uncertainties prevent a firm conclusion. The delta C-13 offset between the Penultimate Glacial Maximum and Last Glacial Maximum reconstructed for the ocean and atmosphere is most likely caused by imbalances between weathering, volcanism, and burial fluxes.

Here we use a marine carbon cycle model to investigate the effects of one CDR technique: the open ocean dissolution of the iron-containing mineral olivine. We analyse the maximum CDR potential of an annual dissolution of 3 Pg olivine during the 21st century and focus on the role of the micronutrient iron for the biological carbon pump. Distributing the products of olivine dissolution (bicarbonate, silicic acid, iron) uniformly in the global surface ocean has a maximum CDR potential of 0.57. gC/g-olivine mainly due to the alkalinisation of the ocean, with a significant contribution from the fertilisation of phytoplankton with silicic acid and iron. The part of the CDR caused by ocean fertilisation is not permanent, while the CO2 sequestered by alkalinisation would be stored in the ocean as long as alkalinity is not removed from the system. For high CO2 emission scenarios the CDR potential due to the alkalinity input becomes more efficient over time with increasing ocean acidification. The alkalinity-induced CDR potential scales linearly with the amount of olivine, while the iron-induced CDR saturates at 113 PgC per century (on average similar to 1.1 PgC. yr(-1)) for an iron input rate of 2.3. Tg. Fe. yr(-1) (1% of the iron contained in 3 Pg olivine). The additional iron-related CO2 uptake occurs in the Southern Ocean and in the iron-limited regions of the Pacific.

They will focus on synthesizing multiple datasets (in situ oceanographic data, coastal salmon survival data, and indices of climate or environmental status) to learn how changes in water masses, currents, stratification, nutrient concentrations, etc., respond to climate forcing and in turn affect primary production and salmon survival. The four specific objectives of the study are (1) to relate the changing in situ physical and chemical ocean conditions observed during the major climate events of 1997-2003 to primary production and salmon survival, (2) to determine whether in situ physical and chemical ocean conditions, primary production, and salmon survival in the upwelling domains north and south of Cape Blanco have similar interannual variability, (3) to determine whether seasonal averages and interannual variability of ocean conditions in the northern California Current system during the 1997-2003 epoch system were significantly different from earlier epochs for which historical data are available and (4) to relate commonly used indices of ocean conditions to local in situ measures which directly affect primary production and advection and to search for improved indices and measures. This synthesis of interdisciplinary oceanographic data with salmon survival and climate indices will advance intellectual understanding of critical processes in coastal upwelling ecosystems and improve understanding of the dynamic processes that contribute to statistical correlations between salmon survival and climate indices. This study will have broad impacts on the future of ecosystem monitoring and management in the Northeast Pacific, and on future research in other coastal upwelling regions. Identifying a few in situ measures or parameters that are critical for primary production and for salmon smolt survival would make it feasible and efficient to use coastal observing stations to monitor the health of the upwelling ecosystem.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,434810,,,,,,,,Oregon State University,,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:13750253,,

There is a lack of readily applicable examples of how regrowth of forests and woodlands can be integrated with existing grazing production systems and provide soil-protection and water-retention benefits. A system of integrated vegetation bands (IVB) was applied to patchy regrowth of acacia and eucalypt vegetation in a grazed landscape of southern Queensland, Australia. Across a 39.8-ha catchment with 3-5% slope, regrowth of scattered native vegetation (18.4 ha) was surveyed and diameter at breast height and height for all woody plants were recorded. The IVB (6.3 ha) were then marked out as 25-m-wide bands set 100m apart and offset at similar to 2-3% gradient to the contour line, retaining the densest/largest regrowth where possible. The data on diameter at breast height and height were analysed using allometric equations to compare aboveground biomass in the original regrowth condition ('Original') to that retained in the installed IVB ('IVB-Riparian'). Estimates of aboveground biomass were calculated for the Original and IVB-Riparian and compared with three other potential regrowth-vegetation management 'treatments' in a desktop-modelling study. The models were designated as: (1) 'Original'; (2) 'Broad' (broad-scale cleared with only a few large trees along a creek retained)'; (3) 'Big Trees' (only large trees >40 cm diameter at breast height retained); (4) 'Riparian-IVB (bands of vegetation); and (5) 'Riparian-IVB-Big Trees' (large trees together with 'IVB-Riparian'). In the non-forested area of the catchment, 'Riparian-IVB-Big Trees' (301 t), 'Big Trees' (249 t) and 'Riparian-IVB' (200 t) had the highest aboveground biomass retained, whereas 'Broad' resulted in the most pasture area (similar to 33 ha) followed by 'Riparian-IVB' (similar to 26 ha). The 'Riparian-IVB' treatment had the highest tree density within the vegetation bands and more than half (53%) of the original woody biomass in regrowth was retained on just under a quarter (23%) of the land area minimising the impact on the area of pasture/grazing land.

The integration of remote sensing and modeling thus produces spatially explicit information on carbon storage and flux.

The Coast Range study area was predominately private land managed for timber production, whereas the West Cascades study area was predominantly public land that was less productive but experienced little harvesting in the 1990s. In the Coast Range area, 17% of the land base was harvested between 1991 and 2000. Much of the area was in relatively young, productive-age classes that simulations indicate are a carbon sink.

We studied dissolved organic matter production and chemistry from organic soil horizons across a 4.1 My old well-constrained chronosequence in Hawaii. Controlled soil column irrigation and leaching experiments were conducted on field moist organic soil horizons to quantify microbial activity, DOM production and chemistry. Both microbial activity (defined as CO2 production per unit substrate C) and DOM production were found to be lowest in the youngest (0.3 ky) and oldest (4.1 My) sites of the chronosequence, where nutrients (N and P respectively) were most limiting. By contrast, DOM production and microbial activity was greatest at the intermediate-aged (20-350 ky) sites where nutrients were least limiting, unrelated to the mass of organic matter found in the organic horizons. While differences in production rates were found, C-13 NMR spectroscopic results indicated that there was a convergence of chemistry from the solid to the dissolved phase at all sites. In particular, all DOM samples were found to have a high proportion of aromatic acids. With supporting data from a diverse range of ecosystems, we postulate that chemical homogenization of DOM relative to source material is a common feature of many ecosystems due to two microbially mediated processes: (1) similar extracellular enzymatic oxidation conferring solubility to a subset of degradation products; and (2) the rapid selective consumption of the more labile organic compounds in the soil solution.",,,,,,,,,7,0,0,0,6,0,9,,,0168-2563,,,,,,,,,,,"CSIRO, Div Land & Water, Glen Osmond, SA 5064, AustraliaUniv Calif Santa Cruz, Dept Earth & Planetary Sci, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA",,,,2013-05-22,WOS:000317863300016,,

This study documents the geometry, architectural association and paleogeographic occurrence of co-genetic debrite-turbidite beds in the Carboniferous Ross Sandstone with the goal of reducing uncertainty in the interpretation of subsurface data in similarly shaped basins where oil and gas is produced.The Ross Sandstone of western Ireland was deposited in a structurally confined submarine basin. Two outcrops contain co-genetic debrite-turbidite beds: Ballybunnion and Inishcorker. Both of the exposures contain strata deposited on the margin of the basin. An integrated dataset was used to characterize the stratigraphy of the Ballybunnion exposure. The exposure is divided into lower, middle, and upper units. The lower unit contains laminated shale with phosphate nodules, structureless siltstone, convolute bedding/slumps, locally contorted shale, and siltstone turbidites. The middle unit contains co-genetic debrite-turbidite beds, siltstone turbidites, and structureless siltstone. Each co-genetic debrite-turbidite bed contains evidence that fluid turbulence and matrix strength operated alternately and possibly simultaneously during deposition by a single sediment-gravity-flow event. The upper unit contains thin-bedded sandy turbidites, amalgamated sandy turbidites, siltstone turbidites, structureless siltstone, and laminated shale. A similar vertical facies pattern is found at Inishcorker.Co-genetic debrite-turbidite beds are only found at the basin-margin. We interpret these distinct beds to have originated as sand-rich, fully turbulent flows that eroded muddy strata on the slope as well as interbedded sandstone and mudstone in axial positions of the basin floor forming channels and associated megaflute erosional surfaces. This erosion caused the axially dispersing flows to laterally evolve to silt- and clay-rich flows suspended by both fluid turbulence and matrix strength due to a relative increase in clay proportions and associated turbulence suppression. The flows were efficient enough to bypass the basin center/floor, physically disconnecting their deposits from coeval lobes, resulting in deposition of co-genetic debrite-turbidite beds on the basin margin. The record of these bypassing flows in axial positions of the basin is erosional surfaces draped by thin siltstone beds with organic debris. A detailed cross-section through the Ross Sandstone reveals a wedge of low net-to-gross, poor reservoir-quality strata that physically separates sandy, basin-floor strata from the basin margin. The wedge of strata is referred to as the transition zone. The transition zone is composed of co-genetic debrite-turbidite beds, structureless siltstone, slumps, locally contorted shale, and laminated shale. Using data from the Ross Sandstone, two equations are defined that predict the size and shape of the transition zone. The equations use three variables (thickness of basin-margin strata, thickness of coeval strata on the basin floor, and angle of the basin margin) to solve for width (w) and trajectory of the basinward side of the low net-to-gross wedge (beta). Beta is not a time line, but a facies boundary that separates sandy basin floor strata from silty basin-margin strata. The transition zone is interpreted to exist on lateral and distal margins of the structurally confined basin.Seismic examples from Gulf of Mexico minibasins reveal a wedge of low continuity, low amplitude seismic facies adjacent to the basin margin. Strata in this wedge are interpreted as transition-zone sediments, similar to those in the Ross Sandstone. Besides defining the size and shape of the transition zone, the variables w and beta define two important drilling parameters. The variable w corresponds to the minimum distance a well bore should be positioned from the lateral basin margin to intersect sandy strata, and beta corresponds to the deviation (from horizontal) of the well bore to follow the interface between sandy and low net-to-gross strata. Calculations reveal that w and beta are related to the relative amount of draping, condensed strata on the margin and the angle of the basin margin. Basins with shallowly dipping margins and relatively high proportions of draping, clay-rich strata have wider transition zones compared to basins with steeply dipping margins with little draping strata. These concepts can reduce uncertainty when interpreting subsurface data in other structurally confined basins including those in Gulf of Mexico, offshore West Africa, and Brunei.

The most difficulty of exploring oil in this region is the depth where the equipment is installed and the production lines must be safe for such activities. Full understanding of the dynamics of the behavior of this equipment is vital to the success of offshore production and operation due to environmental problems that can occur in an accident and a large amount of economic and human resources involved. The phenomenon of the vortex induced vibration (VIV) is complex and involves an interaction between hydrodynamic forces and the response of the structure. The force and displacement can be determined through experimental tests or the complete numerical simulation of the interaction between the structure and fluid. DNV-GL has recently published a guideline about the design of a subsea jumper [1], but it is still needed many studies and experiments to improve the evaluation of VIV in rigid subsea jumpers in the oil industry. The main objective of the present work is to investigate VIV phenomenon in a jumper exposed to uniform flow and verb its oscillation in the flow direction, which called inline VIV (VIVx).

In the case of offshore environments, these constraints can be avoided if a horizontal antenna is towed close to the seabed, which maximises the electromagnetic energy transferred from the overburden to the reservoir and nanofluids in the reservoir. In this research, a new enhanced antenna is used with iron oxide (Fe2O3) and zinc oxide (ZnO) nanofluids for oil recovery applications at the laboratory scale. In the antenna study, it was observed that the curve antenna with magnetic feeders gave a 1978% increase in the magnetic field signal strength compared to the case without magnetic feeders. The curve antenna with magnetic feeders produced a 473% increase in the electric field signal strength compared to the case without magnetic feeders. Iron oxide (Fe2O3) nanoparticles were prepared by the sol-gel method. The iron oxide (Fe2O3) nanoparticle sizes were in the range of 30.27-37.60 nm. FESEM and HRTEM images show that the samples have good crystallinity and that the grain size increased as temperature increased. Iron oxide (Fe2O3) samples sintered at 500 degrees C showed a high initial permeability and Q-factor and a low loss factor compared to samples sintered at 500 degrees C. The sample had a very high initial permeability and a low loss at low frequencies; therefore, it was suitable for the preparation of the nanofluid and oil recovery applications. Oil recovery through the usage of 0.1% (w/w) iron oxide (Fe2O3) nanofluid with an EM field generated from the curve antenna with magnetic feeders was 33.45 % of OOIP (original oil in place). In a similar case where 0.1 % (w/w) zinc oxide (ZnO) nanofluid with an EM field was used, 22.46 % of OOIP was recovered. These results imply that injecting 0.1% w/w iron oxide nanofluid coupled to the curve antenna with magnetic feeders has potential for oil recovery for improved water flooding systems because the high magnetic flux density that acts on the nanoparticles is proportional to the magnetic field strength.",,,,,,,,,20,1,0,0,1,0,22,,,1662-5250,1661-9897,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Teknol PETRONAS, Fundamental & Appl Sci Dept, Tronoh 31750, Perak, MalaysiaUniv Teknol PETRONAS, Dept Elect & Elect Engn, Tronoh 31750, Perak, Malaysia",,,,2014-03-05,WOS:000330816600014,,

It is thus important that the chemicals used have low or no environmental effects. To check this, standard ecotoxicity and biodegradability tests for a marine environment were performed on more than 40 amines, including both solvents already in use for CO2-removal and new promising chemicals. The results form a database for environmental risk assessment of common absorption solvents and will be used to correlate chemical structure of the solvents to degradation and toxicity data for use in solvent screening. Some of the solvents used for carbon capture, have been shown to have low biodegradability. The tertiary amines which have been tested do not degrade easily, while the amino acids tested both have low toxicity and degrade easily. The fate estimation model EPI Suite (TM) [US EPA, Washington DC, USA] has also been used to estimate the biodegradation and toxicity of the chemicals.

This paper proposes a renewable energy model based on national targets 'decomposed' into regional targets that incorporate technological processes and environmental conditions at the individual project level. At the project level, resource potential is allocated into individual projects based on the current technological level. The available resources and renewable energy generation of each project changes as the technology evolves and the environmental conditions change over time. The model can be adjusted according to actual needs of each region; thus policymakers can establish the respective targets for power, heating, oil and gas as well as renewable energy based on the regional context. Overall, the total national target can be decomposed into regional targets and technological targets. This paper proposes long-term regional development targets for renewable energy based on the total supply curve for renewable energy in different periods. Fujian province will be applied as an example to validate the target decomposition model of renewable energy targets of various regions and technologies in China. The model projected that the economic capacity of renewable energy generation in Fujian province for dam hydropower, offshore wind power, onshore wind power, photovoltaic power and waste incineration power is expected to reach 4748 MW, 4036 MW, 3581 MW, 2663 MW and 766 MW, respectively by 2025. The research result could have wider implications such as achieving GHG emissions reductions targets, addressing environmental concerns, providing high tech jobs within the region and contributing to energy security at the local and national level.

In this paper, six block copolymers of ethylene oxide and propylene oxide were prepared by using N,N-dimethylethanolamine (DMEA) as the acceptor (DMEA-mnp and DMEA-mnpq, n:m:p:q represented the weight ratio of different blocks). Most of DMEA products could perform well for treating OWPF, especially DMEA1231. Their performances were mainly affected by temperature. The reason of increasing oil removal performance of DMEA1231 with temperature was the decrease of interfacial dilational modulus (epsilon) with increasing temperature. When temperature raised up to 55 degrees C, the epsilon of DMEA1231 had the minimum (1.5lmN/m). Therefore, the OiW had the minimum (90mg/l). Because DMEA1231 had the best performance, its flocculation kinetics was studied systemically. The results showed that the optimum condition for DMEA1231 was as follows: dosage was 300mg/l, temperature was 55 degrees C, stirring speed was 200rpm and stirring time was 5min. At last, the offshore oil field test was carried out to check the DMEA1231 performance. The result showed that at the optimum condition, DMEA1231 could perform as well as the cationic polymer. The most important thing was that flocs of DMEA1231 were not viscous and floated on the surface of the water. The results obtained by this paper provide a good choice for the treatment of OWPF in offshore oilfield to avoid the formation of viscous flocs.

The burning of fossil fuels for energy and resultant carbon emissions are global concerns: The world needs ever increasing energy supplies to sustain economic growth and development. But energy resources are under pressure and carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from today's energy use already threaten our climate. What options do we have for switching to a cleaner and more efficient energy future? (IEA 2008). The basic choice is between action and delay, and forest management is among the set of options that have the capacity to provide stabilization wedges and solve the climate problem for the next half-century (Pacala & Socolow 2004).Wood bioenergy is a proven, cost-effective technology for producing homegrown, reliable baseload energy (O'Laughlin, in press). In 2007 wood provided 1.8 percent of the energy consumed in the United States (EIA 2009). Wood bioenergy use is generally higher in states with extensive forest resources and a substantial forest products business sector, like Idaho, where 4.7 percent of the energy consumed is from wood (Idaho Legislature 2007). Forest products manufacturing mill residues are the low hanging fruit for wood bioenergy, as they have already been transported out of the woods, but almost all mill residues are already used to make energy (Nicholls and others 2008).Forest health thinnings and logging residues are a potential source of feedstocks for wood bioenergy, whether for space heating with thermal energy, electric biopower, or liquid biofuels. The benefits of producing thermal energy and biopower from wood can be substantial; e.g., the University of Idaho (2008) saves on average $1.5 million per year burning wood residues from local sawmills instead of natural gas, and Fuels for Schools projects save $1.8 million per year in fuel costs. These thermal heating solutions are the most efficient use of wood bioenergy and widely used in some European countries (see Richter and others 2009).Using forest residues (thinnings and logging slash) for bioenergy is an opportunity to restore forest health, wildfire resiliency, and wildlife habitat. Silvicultural operations to improve forest conditions can help revitalize rural economies while providing renewable energy feedstocks (Cloughesy & Lord 2006). In addition to this triple win (IFPC 2009; OFRI 2009), forests play a key role in the global carbon cycle by capturing, storing, and cycling carbon (EPA 2009a, see also California Forest Foundation 2009). Forests in the conterminous U.S. sequestered, on average, 162 million metric tons of carbon per year during 1990-2005 (Woodbury and others 2007). This is sufficient to offset at least 10 percent of all U.S. carbon dioxide emissions (data from EPA 2009b). However, from 2002-2006 wildfires in the conterminous U.S. emitted, on an annual average, 59 million metric tons of carbon as CO2 and two million metric tons as particulate matter (Wiedinmyer & Neff 2007).Considerations for safe storage of carbon on, in, or deep under the soil create roles for forestry (Read 2009). Five types of carbon reservoirs are preferable to storing carbon in the atmosphere, and only the last item does not have an obvious role for forestry: 1) new forestry plantations; 2) new timber structures and other durable wood products from harvested wood; 3) underground wood burial, perhaps in abandoned mines; 4) biochar storage in soil reservoirs with co-produced bio-oil; and 5) carbon capture and storage in deep geological strata or as bicarbonates in the ocean or insoluble carbonates on land in played-out coal mines. In addition, the mortality, and removals he said, Momentum has shifted from conflict and neglect to a recognition that there's actually a gorilla in the room. He opined that with 190 million acres of forests needing treatment, much more than the current level of four to five million acres per year nationwide needs to be accomplished (Crandall 2006). While serving as Chief of the U.S. Forest Service, Dale Bosworth described the situation as unsustainable: We have some 73 million acres of national forest land at risk from wildland fires that could compromise human safety and ecosystem integrity.... The situation is simply not sustainable not socially, not economically, not ecologically (Bosworth 2003).Idaho and Montana face forest health and wildfire risks from overstocked forests. Together the two states have 7 million acres of forests in the high-risk Fire Regime Condition Class (FRCC) 3 category and another 10.5 million acres in FRCC 2 (Schmidt and others 2002). Federal land managers are reducing fuels on an average of 250,000 acres per year (Healthy Forests and Rangelands 2009). At that rate it would take 28 years to treat just the FRCC 3 lands, at which time vegetation would have grown back and retreatment would be necessary to maintain fuel reduction benefits. Forest managers, stakeholders, and policy-makers need to consider whether passively waiting for the inevitable wildfire to burn is better that actively managing fuels, and whether piling and burning biomass onsite is preferable to moving it offsite and burning it in boilers that produce bioenergy. The State of Oregon subsidizes biomass removal for energy production at $10 per green ton (ODE 2007). A similar program failed to pass the Montana legislature in 2009 (O'Laughlin, in press).In conclusion, wood bioenergy opportunities are substantial and sustainable. Many communities are interested in installing wood bioenergy facilities to reduce costs to heat public buildings and provide local jobs. In addition, the uncompensated social benefits of reduced wildfire suppression costs, plus the avoided costs of site rehabilitation and carbon emissions, exceed the value of bioenergy and create a rationale for subsidizing hazardous fuel treatments. The implementation question in the forestry sector is whether the subsidy should be in the form of timber from the forest or cash payments from the public treasury and taxpayers' pockets. In the short term hazardous fuel reduction provides a triple win: improved forest conditions, renewable energy feedstocks, and revitalized rural communities. The reduction of carbon emissions from burning wood in a boiler instead of in the woods is a substantial bonus. The long-term payoff from wood bioenergy will be enhanced energy security.",,,,,National Silviculture Workshop on Integrated Management of Carbon Sequestration and Biomass Utilization Opportunities in a Changing ClimateNational Silviculture Workshop on Integrated Management of Carbon Sequestration and Biomass Utilization Opportunities in a Changing Climate,"June 15 -18, 2009June 15 -18, 2009",,"Boise, ID, USABoise, ID, USA",1,0,0,0,1,0,1,,,1945-0672(print),,*****************(S),,,,,,,,,"Univ Idaho, Coll Nat Resources, Moscow, ID 83843 USA",,,,2009-01-01,BCI:BCI202000379421,,

In this realm, this paper presents an ex ante evaluation of shifting transit vehicles fleet from the current practice of gasoline fuel into natural gas fuel. The evaluation is done through probabilistic cost benefit analysis (CBA). The various options and scenarios for this shift is established taking into consideration the type of natural gas fuel, type of deployment, and stages of deployment. Costs associated with each scenario are estimated and include costs of required infrastructure and refueling stations, capital cost for vehicles, NG converters, fuel costs, life cycle vehicle operating costs and emissions. Expected benefits include direct user savings, emissions reductions, and health benefits. Scenarios of the effects of fuel price fluctuations will be addressed within the CBA analysis using the probabilistic approach. A Monte Carlo simulation will be applied to capture the variability and sensitivity of each of the input parameters, in specific the economic parameters, the interest rate and inflation rate.

The 2011 National Oil Spill Commission investigation identified a range of operational behaviours and underlying safety management problems that were causal to the mishap. Yet, to date these have not been systematically considered within a human factors framework. To achieve this, we draw upon two applied psychology domains that are highly influential within safety research. First, we apply non-technical skills (NTS) (social and cognitive skills that underpin safe performance in complex work environments) theorem to understand operational activities in the lead-up and occurrence of the well blowout. NTS research is used to develop interventions for training and observing safety behaviours (e.g. decision-making, teamwork). Second, we apply safety culture theory to understand how the organisational and industry environment shaped the management of risk. Safety culture research is used to understand and change the socio-technical constraints and enablers of safety activity in high-risk workplaces. Finally, to integrate these perspectives, we take a systems-thinking perspective to understand the mishap. A common critique of accident narratives is their failure to systematically consider how the components of an incident interact together to escalate risk. From a systems-thinking perspective, understanding the interactions leading to the DH mishap is crucial for ensuring interventions are effective in preventing future mishaps. We develop an accident model that captures the various interactions and system factors leading to the blowout.",,,,,,,,,53,0,0,0,1,1,61,,,1366-9877,1466-4461,,,,,,,,,,"London Sch Econ, Inst Social Psychol, London WC2A 2AE, EnglandNatl Univ Ireland, Dept Gen Practice, Galway, Ireland",,,,2014-01-22,WOS:000328464300008,,

Due to the tectonic uplift in Himalayan period, the target shale formation is characterized by shallow burial depth and abundant fractures. The Lower Silurian Longmaxi shale was deposited under deep and shallow continental shelf environments with abundant pyrites and graptolite fossils. The lithology of the formation includes black carbonaceous shale, calcareous shale, and siliceous shale. The thickness of the shale varies greatly from 40 to 200m from southeast to northwest with obvious zonation. Total organic carbon (TOC) content ranges from 1.0 to 4.0% and decreases upward in the formation owing to the change of sedimentary facies. The organic matter reaches dry gas zone. Porosity ranges from 0.5 to 7.9%, and the permeability is measured in the microdarcy to nanodarcy range. Abundant fragile minerals exist in the shales which benefit the hydraulic stimulation. Isothermal adsorption tests show that the sorption gas content in place of the Longmaxi shale ranges from 1.0 to 4.5 m(3)/t and the gas content in place reaches the standard of commercial exploitation. Factors impacting gas-bearing characteristics were analyzed using a mathematical statistic method, which demonstrates that TOC is the most important factor, especially to the sorption gas content.

Carbon concentrations generally decreased, and soil density increased, with soil depth to 50 cm, and were an order of magnitude greater in clay loam soils under native forests of Eucalyptus regnans than in sandy soils under plantations of Pinus radiata.In E. regnans stands, concentrations of soil carbon increased with stand age, but due to a corresponding decrease in soil density there was no trend in carbon content with stand age, with the exception of microbial biomass C, which increased. In P. radiata stands, concentrations of water-soluble C and K2SO4-extractable C increased with stand age, whereas there was no trend in concentrations of the other carbon indices, and for none of the indices of soil C was there a significant trend in carbon content with stand age.Microbial C was less than 4% of total C, and water-soluble C and K2SO4-extractable C less than 1%.

The impact of mangrove deforestation on carbon emissions has been reported on a global scale; however, uncertainty remains at subnational scales due to geographical variability and field data limitations. We present an assessment of blue carbon storage at five mangrove sites across West Papua Province, Indonesia, a region that supports 10% of the world's mangrove area. The sites are representative of contrasting hydrogeomorphic settings and also capture change over a 25-years LULCC chronosequence. Field-based assessments were conducted across 255 plots covering undisturbed and LULCC-affected mangroves (0-, 5-, 10-, 15- and 25-year-old post-harvest or regenerating forests as well as 15-year-old aquaculture ponds). Undisturbed mangroves stored total ecosystem carbon stocks of 182-2,730 (mean +/- SD: 1,087 +/- 584) Mg C/ha, with the large variation driven by hydrogeomorphic settings. The highest carbon stocks were found in estuarine interior (EI) mangroves, followed by open coast interior, open coast fringe and EI forests. Forest harvesting did not significantly affect soil carbon stocks, despite an elevated dead wood density relative to undisturbed forests, but it did remove nearly all live biomass. Aquaculture conversion removed 60% of soil carbon stock and 85% of live biomass carbon stock, relative to reference sites. By contrast, mangroves left to regenerate for more than 25 years reached the same level of biomass carbon compared to undisturbed forests, with annual biomass accumulation rates of 3.6 +/- 1.1 Mg C ha(-1) year(-1). This study shows that hydrogeomorphic setting controls natural dynamics of mangrove blue carbon stocks, while long-term land-use changes affect carbon loss and gain to a substantial degree. Therefore, current land-based climate policies must incorporate landscape and land-use characteristics, and their related carbon management consequences, for more effective emissions reduction targets and restoration outcomes.",,,,,,,,,67,1,0,0,39,0,70,,,1354-1013,1365-2486,,,,,,,,,,"Charles Darwin Univ, Res Inst Environm & Livelihoods, Casuarina, NT 0810, AustraliaCtr Int Forestry Res, Bogor, IndonesiaNatl Univ Singapore, Dept Geog, Singapore, SingaporeGreen Forest Prod & Tech Pte Ltd, Res Dept, Singapore, SingaporeGriffith Univ, Australian Rivers Inst Coast & Estuaries, Gold Coast, Qld, AustraliaUniv Papua, Fac Agr, Manokwari, IndonesiaMinist Marine Affairs & Fisheries, Inst Marine Res & Observat, Perancak, Bali, IndonesiaUniv Papua, Fac Forestry, Manokwari, IndonesiaUniv Papua, Fac Fisheries, Manokwari, IndonesiaConservat Int Indonesia, Jakarta, IndonesiaIndonesian Inst Sci LIPI, Res Ctr Biol, Cibinong, IndonesiaProv Govt Papua Barat, Res & Dev Agcy, Manokwari, IndonesiaRoyal Bot Gardens, Richmond, Surrey, EnglandUniv Edinburgh, Sch Geosci, Changing Oceans Grp, Edinburgh, Midlothian, ScotlandUniv Cambridge, Dept Zool, Cambridge, EnglandConservat Int, Arlington, VA USAUniv Queensland, Sch Biol Sci, St Lucia, Qld, AustraliaIPB Univ, Dept Geophys & Meteorol, Bogor, IndonesiaWorld Resources Inst Indonesia, Jakarta 12170, Indonesia",Green Forest Prod & Tech Pte LtdProv Govt Papua BaratWorld Resources Inst Indonesia,,,2020-03-24,WOS:000521080500001,32112604,

Studies have revealed variable impacts of oil toxicity on the environment and exposed populations. The revelation gained much international attention in 2011 with the release of Environmental Assessment of Ogoniland report by the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP). This has up scaled local and international pressures for urgent clean-up and restoration of degraded bio-resource rich environments of the Niger Delta, starting from Ogoniland. Previous remediation attempts in the area had failed due to erroneous operational conclusions (such as conclusions by oil industry operators that the Niger Delta soil is covered by a layer of clay and as such oil percolation remains within the top soil and makes remediation by enhanced natural attenuation (RENA) suitable for the region) and the adoption of incompatible and ineffective approaches (i.e. RENA) for the complex and dynamic environments. Perennial conflicts, poor regulatory oversights and incoherent standards are also challenges. Following UNEP recommendations, the Federal Government of Nigeria recently commissioned the clean-up and remediation of Ogoniland project; it would be novel and trend setting. While UNEP outlined some measures of contaminated land remediation, no specific approach was identified to be most effective for the Niger Delta region. Resolving the technical dilemma and identified social impediments is the key success driver of the above project. In this paper, we reviewed the socio-economic and ecological impacts of contaminated land in the Niger Delta region and the global state-of-the-art remediation approaches. We use coastal environment clean-up case studies to demonstrate the effectiveness of bioremediation (sometimes in combination with other technologies) for remediating most of the polluted sites in the Niger Delta. Bioremediation should primarily be the preferred option considering its low greenhouse gas and environmental footprints, and low-cost burden on the weak and overstretched economy of Nigeria.

Volume of the container was reduced and standardized, the neck became visibly smaller, and the rim less pronounced. The handles became massive, elongated and protruded above the rim. Throughout the Middle Ages the production was in continual decline, until it completely disappeared in the 14th century. In the Western and Central Mediterranean it is almost impossible to trace the development of amphorae from as early as the 8th century. Nonetheless, several exceptions have been found in the Eastern Adriatic, along with similar examples from the Peloponnese and Southern Apulia, indicating that amphorae had not entirely vanished from the market and were still being used in certain areas and trade routes as late as the 13th and the 14th century.In the course of a 2006 archaeological survey in Central Dalmatia, off the islet of Marara, a larger concentration of amphorae fragments was discovered, at 8-10 m below sea level. Nearly all of these fragments belonged to a type of small-sized amphora with an elongated ovoid body and a small bulge at the bottom. Massive strap handles are placed high above the rim and the surface is covered with more or less pronounced horizontal ribs, characteristic of the clay containers in the medieval period. This form of amphora is almost impossible to find in the Eastern Adriatic. Nevertheless, a similar example was discovered in the collection of the Franciscan Monastery in the island of Krapanj. Only a small fragment of the bottom is missing from the amphora, which allowed an estimate to be made of the dimensions of the amphorae from Merara. They were 39-40 cm high and 18 cm wide in diameter. An unaccentuated rim is 5 cm wide in diameter, with handles slanting upwards and then sharply bending to the shoulders of the vessel. Since no exact data exist as to the location or the context in which the amphora from Krapanj was found, a possibility of it originating from a shipwreck off Merara should not be dismissed. In the chronological division of medieval Byzantine amphorae, Ch. Bakirtzis classifies this type as Type 7, the final type, after which the amphorae intended for trading and transportation ceased to be produced. Bakirtzis dates them to the 13th/14th, based on an analogy with amphorae that were discovered during a renovation of the Church of the Virgin Hodegetria (Aphendiko) in Mistra, not far from Sparta. It is possible to trace such amphorae across other sites in the Peloponnese, Corinth and on the Agios Stephanos site in the south of the peninsula, where they had been found together with coins and archaic majolica from Italian workshops and therefore dated to the first half of the 14th century. A similar amphora was found during a survey of the coastal area off SE Apulia, on the site of Torre dell'Orso. Although medieval ceramics furnaces that were used for producing local, mostly Apulian types of amphorae, have been found in the area, an analysis of the clay of the amphora from Torre dell'Orso and a comparison with raw material from local clay deposits, indicated that the origin of its production should be looked for elsewhere. As the amphora is similar in appearance to those from Merara and the Peloponnese, and in terms of the composition of the clay to those from the Agios Stephanos site, there is a possibility that it was produced somewhere in the Peloponnese. Throughout the Peloponnese marly clay was used in the production of pottery. It is rich in limestone, with an addition of finely crushed quartz sand and iron oxide. The raw material of the amphorae from Merara and Torre dell'Orso had nearly the same characteristics. That alone certainly does not establish the origin of their production, but offers guidelines for further research. Many amphorae from the Peloponnese were found in the context of Italian majolica of the 13th and 14th century, which testifies to an active trade exchange that existed between the Byzantine provinces and the south of Apulia. Neighboring Dalmatia was part of this sea trade route, as evidenced by the amphorae from Merara and similar examples from the Shallows of Lucnjak. The Shallows of Lucnjak near the island of Korcula was examined in the 2011 survey of the underwater off Dubrovnik.Amongst a substantial amount of material dating from the Antiquity and Late Antiquity, three fragments of amphorae were discovered, similar to the type from Merara, along with a body of a larger pear-shaped amphora. Amphorae of this type can be traced along the coasts of the Black Sea and the Marble Sea and across almost the entire Mediterranean. The characteristic pear-shaped body with a narrow elongated neck and the handles placed high is densely furrowed with a comb-like object. The amphora is 63 cm tall, and the widest part is 30 cm wide in diameter. Based on the chronological division of Byzantine amphorae from the territory of Turkey, N. Gunsenin classified them as Type 3 and dated them to the 12th and 13th century. Ch. Bakirtzis categorized them as Type 5 and dated them to the same period. The remaining fragments of medieval amphorae from the Shallows of Lucnjak match the form and characteristics of the amphorae from Merara. Within the same context, five clay recipients containing grayish sediment were also found. A similar type of flammable clay projectiles was used in the Byzantine Empire since the 8th century. Sediment analysis showed that the recipients contained a 91.31% calcium carbonate and further suggested that they were filed with quicklime. The use of flammable weapons in the form of hand projectiles had spread during the Early Middle Ages throughout the Mediterranean and certainly continued into the 12th and the 13th centuries. It is therefore possible that the recipients from the Shallows of Lucnjak, found in the context of amphorae dated to the 13th or 14th century, represent a variety of this medieval type of weaponry.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,,0,0,0,,,1847-9464,1848-6681,,,,,,,,,,"Hrvatski Restauratorski Zavod Odjel Podvodnu Arhe, Cvijete Zuzor 43, Zagreb, Croatia",Hrvatski Restauratorski Zavod Odjel Podvodnu Arhe,,,2012-01-01,WOS:000422242300011,,

In addition, the increased complexity, safety requirements, and space required for LNG installation increase the capital cost. This article uses a systems engineering approach to clarify the technical aspects of LNG-fuelled systems, their potential implementation costs, and the expertise and training required to operate them safely. Ship owners can use such an approach to aid decision-making and trade-off analyses. Naval architects may also benefit from better information management.

The condition and performance of existing systems operated beyond their originally intended design life are controlled through maintenance. For new systems there is the option to simultaneously develop the design and the maintenance processes for best effect when a longer life expectancy is planned. This paper reports a combined Petri net and Bayesian network approach to investigate the effects of design and maintenance features on the system performance. The method has a number of features which overcome limitations in traditionally used system performance modelling techniques, such as fault tree analysis, and also enhances the modelling capabilities. Significantly, for the assessment of aging systems, the new method avoids the need to assume a constant failure rate over the lifetime duration. In addition the assumption of independence between component failures events is no longer required. In comparison with the commonly applied system modelling techniques, this new methodology also has the capability to represent the maintenance process in far greater detail and as such options for: inspection and testing, servicing, reactive repair and component replacement based on condition, age or use can all be included. In considering system design options, levels of redundancy and diversity along with the component types selected can be investigated. All of the options for the design and maintenance can be incorporated into a single integrated Petri net and Bayesian network model and turned on and off as required to predict the effects of any combination of options selected. In addition this model has the ability to evaluate different system failure modes.The integrated Petri-net and Bayesian network approach is demonstrated through application to a remote un-manned wellhead platform from the oil and gas industry.",,,,,,,,,17,0,0,0,0,0,18,,,0951-8320,1879-0836,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Nottingham, Nottingham, England",,,,2017-05-10,WOS:000399632100009,,

However, wireless propagation in an all-metal environment with ducting and sealed doors between compartments is difficult to model, and the operating machinery further complicates wireless network planning. This makes it necessary to characterize the performance of the physical wireless links in the actual operating environments. However, little has been reported in the literature on methodologies for measuring the full range of physical link quality indicators. In this paper, we present a methodology for doing this that we have verified by the deployment of a 2.4GHz network of 18 nodes in three different all-metal scenarios: a cluster of freight containers, a full-sized shore-based working ship's engine room training facility, and an operational ship's engine room. The output variables included the key link quality indicators of packet delivery ratio (PDR), RSSI, and LQI for every possible link, as well as the performance of every node. We believe that this is the first time that this full range of physical link quality indicators has been measured in this type of application environment. We found that in all three scenarios the network performed with over 90% PDR average. However, as the scenarios become more complex, the communications become more unpredictable, yielding a wider transition zone, indicating that although a WSN could operate in these scenarios under different conditions, a pre-deployment practical study is essential for each new scenario.",,,,,,,,,4,0,0,0,0,0,4,,,1022-0038,1572-8196,,,,,,,,,,"Cork Inst Technol, Nimbus Ctr, Cork, Ireland",,,,2019-03-12,WOS:000459509300022,,

This conflicts with geological studies which have been interpreted to indicate minor displacement. The inability to reconcile these interpretations has precluded understanding the tectonic development of the Cordillera, and has cast doubt on global paleogeographic reconstructions which rely upon paleomagnetic studies. I demonstrate that Alaska and Yukon are divisible into a series of geological belts, including the northerly east-west-trending Arctic Alaska, the central southwest-trending Ruby, the southerly east-trending Dillinger and the southeast-trending Yukon-Tanana belt. Each belt is characterized by four regularly arranged rock sequences; (1) a Paleozoic continental margin strata, (2) a Devonian-Mississippian arc assemblage, (3) an ophiolite, and (4) an Early to mid-Cretaceous arc. These correlations greatly simplify the terrane nomenclature of the northern Cordillera and provide a basis for a new palinspastic reconstruction of the Cordillera. Continuity of the belts can be demonstrated through connecting oroclines, and facing a structural vergence directions vary in a consistent and predictable fashion indicating that the belts previously formed part of a linear ribbon continent. This ribbon continent, referred to here as SAYBIA, originally extended south from eastern Siberia and was similar to 8000 km long. Northward translation in response to coupling with the Kula plate was accommodated by buckling (oroclinal orogeny) of SAYBIA, much like a derailing train, with scissored 'cars' forming much of Alaska. Oroclinal orogeny makes consistent interpretations of available geological and paleomagnetic data in the Cordillera, provides a means for the rapid construction of continent, and may have been an important process involved in the construction of ancient continental nuclei.

While stakeholders usually agree on general policy objectives, the best course of action for achieving them is often unclear. Forest DSS can support the assessment of alternative forest policy frameworks with respect to their impact on multiple variables of interest for stakeholders and decision makers, yet, these tools are often underutilised.In January 2016 a new land use order policy for the Great Bear Rainforest (GBR) in Canada, the largest coastal temperate rainforest in the world, was legally established. The GBR order aims to support ecosystem-based management and legally binding objectives to ensure the long term health of this unique area. This new policy framework will lead to a dramatic decrease in timber harvest levels. We developed 5 alternative forest management scenarios with a less abrupt decline in harvest levels, including carbon sequestration as an option to economically buffer the expected declines in yield. We modelled the development of the forest resources in the area under each scenario over a timeframe of 350 years. In doing so we were able to show how the use of computer based DSS is able to assist policy making by providing a comprehensive assessment of consequences associated with the alternatives, to ensure that long term targets are met.Our results show that currently, the GBR stores around 1.73 Bt carbon, a number that will increase to 1.84 Bt under the GBR order. While it is possible to increase carbon storage by up to 8% when lowering overall timber harvest by 36% over a timeframe of 350 years, naturally, those scenarios with a less dramatic decline in timber harvest were related to an overall lower level of carbon stocks. Combined approaches though, which allow balancing timber harvests with ecosystem integrity, are a powerful alternative to a dramatic and abrupt decrease in harvest levels. The success of combined approaches does heavily depend on timber and carbon markets though. With notoriously cyclical markets the long term economy related to the implementation of the new GBR order remains uncertain when looking at carbon and timber markets only, strongly suggesting to rely on diversification and the creation of added value products.",,,,,,,,,2,0,0,0,1,0,2,,,1389-9341,1872-7050,,,,,,,,,,"Univ British Columbia, Dept Forest Resources Management, 2424 Main Mall, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z4, CanadaUniv British Columbia, Sauder Sch Business, 2053 Main Mall, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z2, Canada",,,,2019-05-27,WOS:000466849300015,,

We use the GLOCO model, a global carbon cycle model with eight terrestrial biomes that are described mechanistically in detail in terms of the biological processes that involve carbon and nitrogen cycling and the effect of temperature on these processes. GLOCO also considers low-latitude and high-latitude oceans, each divided further into a surface layer and several deeper layers, with an explicit description of biogeochemical processes occurring in each layer, and exchanges among ocean reservoirs and the atmosphere. GLOCO is used to study the transient response of actual vegetation, which is more realistic than looking at equilibrium conditions of potential vegetation.Using estimates of land suitable for restoration in woodlands, grasslands, and deserts, as well as estimates of the rate at which restoration can proceed, we estimate that carbon storage in these biomes can range up to 0.8 billion tons of carbon per year (Gt C/yr), for a combination of land management strategies, This corresponds to a reduction in atmospheric buildup of 0.5 Ct C/yr, which represents up to 15% of the average annual atmospheric carbon buildup in the next century, 3.5 Gt C/yr, assuming the IPCC 92d scenario.

It has also been a requirement of ourpotential customers, including Fugro Airborne Surveys and Sander Geophysics (the largestand second largest geophysical survey companies in the world) and oil, gas and miningexploration and production companies.We propose to investigate the nature of the global market and the financial and technicalfeasibility of developing an airborne collision detection sensor, based on the use of alightweight marine RADAR unit. The shortcoming we have identified with the sole relianceon stereo vision for use in airborne collision detection is associated with the detection ofaircraft flying out of the sun. The US Federal Aviation Authority has allowed the use of amarine RADAR unit in the national airspace, so removing some of the concerns about the useof this type of low-power RADAR unit in a terrestrial application.Our aim, should the market analysis be positive, would be to develop and use this system onUA that fly beyond line of sight, to enable the aircraft to detect and avoid airborne objects,such as other aircraft, balloons and parachutists.Once proven, it was suggested by Cliff Whittaker at the Civil Aviation Authority, this sensorcould find wider application on light aircraft, so contributing to the safety of air travel andenabling us to build up a world leading export business in this area in the U.K.Another benefit will be environmental, since UA use less fuel than their manned counterpartsper kilometre travelled",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,700298,,,,,,,,Barnard Microsystems Limited,Barnard Microsystems Limited,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:15403889,,

J,,,,,,,,,Pietro Goglio; Adrian Williams,,Harmonising and UPgrading GREENhouse gas removal (GGR) consequential Life Cycle Assessment (UP-green-LCA),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Awarded Grant,Jun 20 2017,2017,"GGR topic-specific project proposal. To achieve the UK targets for cutting greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, a steady reduction of 3% should be achieved and maintained every year by the whole UK economy. This is the requirement for UK in order to achieve the potential target of 1.5 degrees C of global warming. Different techniques (e.g. land management and use change, ocean fertilisation, bioenergy with carbon capture and storage, biochar, direct air capture) have been proposed to remove GHG; but their implementation can have large and unforeseen effects considering all the impacts across the economy. Some techniques such as afforestation, bioenergy, carbon capture and storage could potentially have large land use change and affect the food chains. Methodological approaches, such life cycle assessment (LCA), have been widely adopted to assess different greenhouse gas removal techniques (GGRT). LCA allows to account for all the impacts from raw material extraction, production, transport, use and waste disposal of a production systems, product or service. In particular consequential LCA approaches have been used to assess the consequences of the various applications of greenhouse gas removal techniques. However consequential LCA is largely based on assumptions and large uncertainties are bound to this approach. Further there is no consensus on the LCA methodology to assess GGRT, let alone the results, and a fair comparison of the efficacy and cost of the different GGRT is required to have an accurate assessment of the benefits of GGRT. This research proposal is an attempt in reducing the lack of consistency and increase accuracy and robustness of the impacts of alternative GGRT. The main aim of this project is to harmonise the various LCA approaches to assess GGRT, including biochar application, biomass carbon storage, land management change, ocean fertilisation and direct air capture. The project also aims to systematically test and assess the uncertainties related to the application of the consequential LCA to GGRT to improve consequential LCA approaches for greenhouse gas removal. The new approaches are compared with other consortia and research projects targeted to greenhouse gas removal techniques and will be used in a consequential LCA of specific case studies for each greenhouse gas removal group.The methodology adopted consists in a systematic review across economic sectors and focuses on the specific methods of analysing consequential impacts and uncertainties in the analyses (e.g. assumptions about economic responses). Selected case studies will be used to test the current approaches to identify and rank the importance of the various sources of uncertainties (and other strengths and weaknesses) related to consequential LCA. This will be combined with a series of workshops with other researchers and key advisers involved in assessing GGRT to harmonise the developed approaches. The advisors will form an advisory panel and will represent areas of the economy, policy and third sector organisations that would be affected by large scale implementation of GGRT. This will feed into an upgrading process of current consequential LCA methods with the aim of making the assessment of GGRT more robust and more accurate to achieve a real and substantial reduction of global warming (at least 1-10 Gt of CO2eq per year worldwide).",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,NE/P019668/1,,,,,,,,Cranfield UniversityCranfield University,,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:15388050,,

Successful mitigation of microbial corrosion requires a complete characterization of the microbial community present in the system. This paper deals with the extensive microbial analysis and study of performance of biocide formulations for different water types in an oilfield. RESULTS Water, solid and coupon samples were collected at various points in the production system and analyzed for total microbial numbers by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) and microbial diversity using next-generation sequencing (NGS). A high-throughput multi-well system was used to screen eight different biocide formulations at various dosage levels. A pipeline simulator reactor was developed and used to represent field conditions such as temperature, flow and shear rates. The tests showed that the dominant microbial species causing corrosion were sulfate-reducing Desulfovibrio spp. in seawater and brackish water systems and acid-producing fermentative Halanaerobium spp. in effluent water. The results showed that different biocide treatment strategies have to be adopted for treating different water types. Biocide formulations containing ADBAC and THPS + surfactant showed the most promising results for seawater, whereas biocide formulations of ADBAC and THPS + glutaraldehyde performed better for brackish and effluent waters. CONCLUSION The study has shown that molecular methods such as qPCR and NGS provide better and accurate evaluation of the microbial community in the field compared with conventional growth-based methods, leading to optimized mitigation strategies.

All three dispersants, i.e. Corexit EC9500A, Corexit EC9527A and SPC 1000, promoted the photolysis rate of 9,10-DMA, following the order of Corexit EC9500A > Corexit EC9527A > SPC 1000. The photodegradation rate was well interpreted by a two-stage, first-order kinetic law with a faster initial photolysis rate in the presence of the dispersants. Span 80, Tween 85 and kerosene were found as the key dispersant components, of which Span 80 and Tween 85 promoted the photodegradation by boosting absorbance of solar irradiation while kerosene by dispersing more PAHs in the upper layer of the water column. Dissolved oxygen (DO) inhibited photolysis of anthracene regardless of dispersant resulting'from quenching the excited states of the PAH, while DO facilitated photolysis of 9,10-DMA due to the formation singlet oxygen (102) radicals in the presence of oil dispersants. The other ROS, i.e. center dot O-2(-) and center dot OH, played a negligible role on the photodegradation of anthracene and 9,10-DMA. Fluorescence analysis showed that more anthracene was associated with dispersant than 9,10-DMA, which favored the direct transfer of energy to anthracene, while energy is more likely transferred to oxygen to form O-1(2) in the case of 9,10-DMA. Direct photolysis dominated the photodegradation of anthracene and 9,10-DMA. Both direct ionization of anthracene and the electron transfer from excited 9,10-DMA to oxygen can lead to formation of the corresponding PAH radical cations. Overall, the oil dispersants accelerated the photolysis rates of the PAHs without altering the degradation pathway. The findings are useful for understanding photochemical weathering of dispersed oil components in the environment. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

J,,,,,,,,,Paul Seakins,,Atmospheric Oxidation of Amines Relevant for Carbon Capture and Storage,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Awarded Grant,Aug 31 2011,2011,"Post combustion CO2 capture from flue gas streams by amine based species will form a major component of the strategy for CO2 mitigation in the short and medium term. The wide spread uptake of this technology necessary to make a significant impact will require the production of many thousands of tonnes of amines with consequent atmospheric release either in small but still significant amounts during production, transport, use, recycling and disposal or in larger amounts following accidental release or plant failure. Very little is known about the atmospheric lifetimes or degradation products of even simple amines or the more complex amines that have been proposed for carbon capture (e.g. monoethanolamine - MEA). The overall objective of this project is to fill this gap in our knowledge on the gas phase oxidation of amines. The very limited studies that have taken place to date show that both gas phase and heterogeneous oxidation is important. The focus of this project is gas phase chemistry, but we have colleagues in Leeds and collaborators in the University of Oslo who are experts on the heterogeneous process, so that there will be a good flow of information between the two communities. The first component of the project is the measure the rate coefficients for the reaction of a variety of amines with important atmospheric oxidants such as the OH, NO3 and Cl radicals and ozone (O3). These rate coefficients will be measured under isolated conditions, focusing on just this first step in the amine oxidation process. The measurements will be performed using techniques such as laser flash photolysis and laser induced fluorescence. The resulting rate coefficients will allow us to calculate the atmospheric lifetimes of the amines and hence the spatial spread of any pollution. The second component of the project will be to determine the chemical mechanism for the production of first and subsequent generation products for selected important amines such as MEA. This will be achieved both by determining the position of the initial radical attack on the amine (i.e. for a simple amine such as CH3NH2, what fraction of the H atoms abstracted comes from the CH3 or NH2 groups?) and by observing the concentrations of the stable products, primarily by IR spectroscopy. Amine oxidation following attack at the RNHR group to form NR2 radicals has the potential to form highly toxic nitrosamines following reaction of NR2 with NO. By determining the rate coefficients for NR2 formed from selected important amines, with NO and O2, the third component of the project will asses the potential for nitrosamine formation. The final component of the project is to combine the above information and incorporate into a comprehensive chemical model of the atmosphere - the Master Chemical Mechanism, MCM - to assess the potential for amines to contribute to ozone production (air quality and climate change implications) and other atmospheric issues. The project will involve interactions with industrial groups and legislative organisations. Whilst the primary focus is on amines from carbon capture, amines are produced from a variety of sources - e.g. marine environment, so the project has wider applications and potential.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,NE/I013474/1,,,,,,,,University of Leeds,,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:15369328,,

While research literature frames projects as temporary organizations, megaprojects have long initiation and delivery phases, lasting years sometimes decades, and deliver capital assets that are used for decades or centuries. Instead of short-duration activity within a fixed organizational context, these projects involve multiple temporalities, combining more and less temporary forms of organizing in the process of enactment. Using an example of a long-term infrastructural megaproject, a wind-farm, to illustrate the phenomenon, we contribute by articulating different temporalities associated with the delivery project, life-cycle; stakeholder organizations that set up the project; and special purpose vehicles through which it is delivered. Implications of these temporalities for project management research and practice are discussed with reference to understandings of risk and knowledge. We argue that focus on long-term projects and their multiple temporalities opens up new ways of thinking about projects as temporary organizations. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. APM and IPMA.

However, these savannas are subject to frequent and extensive fire. Fire regimes are likely to affect the productivity and carbon sequestration potential of savannas, through effects on both biomass and carbon emissions. The carbon sequestration potential has been estimated for some savanna sites by quantifying carbon storage in biomass and soil pools, and the fluxes to these pools. Using different techniques, previous work in these savannas has indicated that net ecosystem productivity [NEP, net primary productivity (NPP) less heterotrophic respiration] was about -3 t C ha(-1) y(-1) (i.e. a carbon sink). However, the impacts of fire were not accounted for in these calculations. Estimates of NEP have been combined with remotely-sensed estimates of area burnt and associated emissions for a an extensive area of mesic savanna in Arnhem Land, NT, Australia. Combining NEP estimates with precise fire data provides an estimate of net biome productivity (NBP), a production index that includes carbon loss through disturbance ( fire), and is thus a more realistic indicator of sequestration rate from this biome. This preliminary analysis suggests that NBP is approximately-1 t C ha(-1) y(-1) (i.e. a carbon sink). A reduction in the annual area burnt is likely to increase the sink size.

Six types of source rocks could be distinguished within the three depositional environments of the sequence stratigraphic framework: (1) deep lake mudstones and shale deposited in the lacustrine deep-water facies, (2) shallow lake mudstones and carbonaceous mudstones occurring in the shallow lake environment, and (3) deltaic-front mudstones and prodeltaic mudstones developed in the deltaic facies. Deep lake mudstones/shale, which mainly occurred in the SSQ1-TST (transgressive systems tract), SSQ2-TST and LV Formation, are considered organic-rich source rocks with oil-prone generative potential. The shallow lake mudstones and deltaic mudstones were predominantly distributed in the tectonic slope and marginal areas of the Agadem Block within the lowstand systems tract and high stand systems tract of the SSQ1 and SSQ2. Nevertheless, geochemical results indicated that the deltaic mudstones are good gas-prone source rocks but the shallow lake mudstones were classified as poor potential source rocks. The variance in organic matter accumulation and preservation conditions within different depositional facies and the fluctuation of relative lake level are the controlling factors for the occurrence and distribution of high-quality source rocks. The effective Paleogene source kitchen is limitedly distributed around the depocenter of the Dinga Depression within a small scale, and therefore exploration for oil and gas resources from the Paleogene source kitchen should focus on the eastern Dinga fault-step zone adjacent to the depocenter of the Dinga Depression.",,,,,,,,,10,2,2,0,0,0,12,,,0144-5987,2048-4054,,,,,,,,,,"Minist Nat Resources, MNR Key Lab Marine Mineral Resource, Guangzhou Marine Geol Survey, Guangzhou, Peoples R ChinaChina Univ Petr, State Key Lab Petr Resources & Prospecting, Beijing, Peoples R ChinaYangtze Univ, Coll Resources & Environm, Key Lab Explorat Technol Oil & Gas Resources, Minist Educ, Wuhan, Peoples R ChinaPetroChina, Res Inst Petr Explorat & Dev, Beijing, Peoples R China",,,,2020-04-14,WOS:000523007900001,,

Oil fate and transport calculations of the model are significantly impacted by the droplet size distribution. Accuracy of the model predictions heavily depend on how well the model can calculate or represent oil droplet sizes. However, in early oil spill models, the importance of oil droplet size calculation has been overlooked and they used simple empirical formulas. In recent decades, there have been some significant improvements in understanding of oil droplet size calculations. Both experimental studies as well as numerical studies have been contributed to improve oil droplet size calculations. The traditional equilibrium models have been improved while droplet dynamics models provided a different dimension to the oil DSD calculations. Thus, at this stage it is important to review the existing studies and methods of oil droplet size calculation. The objective of this paper is to review the development of oil droplet size calculation in ocean oil spill models highlighting the recent improvements. Furthermore, this paper discusses the capabilities and limitations of different approaches in calculating oil droplet size distribution in both underwater and surface oil spill models and discuss their applicability to different situations. This study will provide a good guideline for future oil spill model developments to improve the oil droplet size calculations.",,,,,,,,,32,0,0,0,8,0,34,,,0025-326X,1879-3363,,,,,,,,,,"Clarkson Univ, Potsdam, NY 13699 USAClarkson Univ, Dept Civil & Envr Engn, Potsdam, NY 13699 USAUniv Notre Dame, Notre Dame, IN 46556 USA",,,,2018-10-01,WOS:000448094200079,30301091,

This event has been extensively studied in the eastern and central Northern Calcareous Alps (NCA), where the global stratotype section and point for the base of the Jurassic is outcropping. We present one of the first combined bio-, litho- and carbonate carbon isotope stratigraphic study across the T-J boundary from the western NCA, focusing on the shallow-water marine carbonate successions Loruns and Steinernes Meer. An almost complete T-J succession with the Upper Triassic Kossen Formation, the T-J Schattwald beds and the Lower Jurassic Loruns oolite is preserved in the Loruns section, whereas a stratigraphic hiatus at the T-J boundary is observed in the Steinernes Meer section. The carbonate carbon isotope record of Loruns shows the characteristic T-J carbon isotope evolution with a short initial negative carbon isotope excursion (CIE) in the lower Schattwald beds, which is separated from the following and longer main negative CIE in the Loruns oolite by a positive excursion in the upper Schattwald beds. The synchroneity of the initial and main CIE with the last occurrence of Triassic fauna and the first appearance of Jurassic ammonites suggests placing the T-J boundary at the base of the Loruns oolite. The Steinernes Meer section records only the main negative CIE in the Loruns oolite due to emersion and/or no sedimentation between the Upper Triassic Kossen Formation and the Lower Jurassic Loruns oolite, caused by regression and synsedimentary tectonics. This study provides new evidence in support the hypothesis that the latest Rhaetian decrease and the Hettangian recovery of the carbonate production coinciding with the initial and main CIE, respectively, can be interpreted as evidence of acidification of the Tethys ocean due to elevated atmospheric CO2 concentrations, probably caused by voluminous volcanic gas emissions.",,,,,,,,,18,2,0,0,7,0,19,,,1661-8726,1661-8734,,,,,,,,,,"ETH, Dept Earth Sci, CH-8092 Zurich, SwitzerlandUniv Zurich, Palaeontol Inst & Museum, CH-8006 Zurich, Switzerland",,,,2016-01-06,WOS:000366637700004,,

Within these legislations exists elements of risk assessment and risk-based corrective action. Despite this progress, we argue that contaminated land management approaches in Nigeria need further development to be able to integrate new scientific information, and to address environmental, economic, and social values. By comparison, advanced contaminated land regimes in the United Kingdom (UK), the Netherlands, Australia, New Zealand, and the United States of America (USA) apply a number of integrative approaches (e.g. sustainability appraisal, liability regime, funding mechanisms, technology demonstration) that enable them to meet the environmental, economic, and social needs of their populations. In comparison, Nigerian governance lacks many of these mechanisms and management of contaminated land is ad hoc. In this paper we propose an integrated risk assessment framework for Nigeria that incorporates the principles of sustainability and stakeholder engagement into the decision-making processes for contaminated land risk assessment and risk management. The integrated approach relies on transparency to promote acceptance and build trust in institutions, and uses stakeholder engagement to address data deficiencies. We conclude this paper with a roadmap for how Nigeria might implement such an integrative approach into their existing contaminated land regulatory system, as well as identify a series of policy priorities that should be addressed.

The petrophysical results of Belayim formation were presented in the form of 3D slicing models to exhibit the variation of these parameters in the different directions. Cross plots of Kareem formation were done using neutron, density and sonic logs which is directly influenced by the matrix composition. By using two or three porosity logs reading we determined the porosity and evaluated the matrix characteristics of Kareem formation as it is considered as a good reservoir for oil and gas and mainly composed of sand stone.

The results showed that the hydrophobicity, particle sizes and specific surface of minerals played an important role in DMA formation. Appropriate hydrophobicity of minerals can enhance the formation of DMA. The surface property of minerals can also influence the shape of DMA. Spherical mineral-oil aggregates were frequently formed with hydrophilic minerals while irregular shaped DMA were observed with hydrophobic minerals. The sizes of DMA also increased when the minerals changed from hydrophilic to hydrophobic. The effects of dispersant and mixing energy were also carefully studied. The results showed that dispersant were a dominant factor. When dispersant was applied, effects of other factors became minimal. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

This paper analyzes and compares the energetics of several desalination technologies at the high salinities and diverse compositions commonly encountered in produced water from shale formations to guide technology selection and to inform further system development. Produced water properties are modeled using Pitzer's equations, and emphasis is placed on how these properties drive differences in system thermodynamics at salinities significantly above the oceanic range. Models of mechanical vapor compression, multi-effect distillation, forward osmosis, humidification-dehumidification, membrane distillation, and a hypothetical high pressure reverse osmosis system show that for a fixed brine salinity, evaporative system energetics tend to be less sensitive to changes in feed salinity. Consequently, second law efficiencies of evaporative systems tend to be higher when treating typical produced waters to near-saturation than when treating seawater. In addition, if realized for high-salinity produced waters, reverse osmosis has the potential to achieve very high efficiencies. The results suggest a different energetic paradigm in comparing membrane and evaporative systems for high salinity wastewater treatment than has been commonly accepted for lower salinity water.

Produced water is the largest volume waste stream in the exploration and production processes of oil and gas. During onshore oil recovery, the petroleum hydrocarbon /water mixture is processed through various separation units where the water extract is either discharged into above ground storage facilities, or re-injected into a subsurface formation as a permanent disposal /secondary recovery process. In offshore or coastal oil recovery operations, produced water is either discharged through shore side outfalls or coastal rim releases (within 4 miles from shore). In many cases, current disposal practices such as these have caused severe environmental petroleum hydrocarbon contamination to surface, ground and coastal waterways. Therefore, a research project was conducted to evaluate the performance of a field (continuous-flow) activated sludge treatment system for removing petroleum hydrocarbons from Southwestern US oilfield generated produced water. Petroleum hydrocarbon removal efficiencies were determined using gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) and total petroleum hydrocarbon (TPH) analysis.

Commonly, PID-controllers are deployed to maintain the operating conditions that minimize fouling, but the design of the controllers is rarely highlighted. The interaction between the deployed controllers can cause undesired performance and even instability. In this study, the relative gain array method was used to find the set of control pairings that minimized the interaction between the control loops. Experimental results showed that by accounting for cross couplings in the design phase of the control system, the controllers performance in terms of reference tracking can be improved significantly. By improving the reference tracking and disturbance rejection capabilities of the filtration system, the selected operating point which minimizes fouling growth, can be maintained consistently subject to disturbances in terms of varying feed flow rate. Better tracking of the operating point can reduce membrane resistance, and consequently reducing the operating cost. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Especially, Tidal energy conversion system is a means of maintaining environment naturally. Tidal current generation is a form to produce electricity by installing rotors, generators to convert a horizontal flow generated by tidal current into rotating movement. According to rotor direction, a tidal current turbine is largely distinguished between horizontal and vertical axis shape. Power capacity depends on the section size crossing a rotor and tidal current speed. We therefore investigated three dimensional flow analysis and performance evaluation using commercial ANSYS-CFX code for an 100kW class horizontal axis turbine for low water level. Then We also studied three dimensional flow characteristics of a rotating rotor and blade surface streamlines around a rotor. As a result, We found that torque increased with TSR, the maximum torque occurred at TSR 3.77 and torque decreased even though TSR increased.

The results obtained allow determining a sustainability fingerprint of the alternative fuel systems considered and a performance ranking.

The N2O5 uptake coefficient has been the subject of numerous laboratory studies; however, only a few studies have determined the uptake coefficient from ambient measurements, and none has been focused on winter conditions, when the portion of NOx removed by N2O5 uptake is the largest. In this work, N2O5 uptake coefficients are determined from ambient wintertime measurements of N2O5 and related species at the Boulder Atmospheric Observatory in Weld County, CO, a location that is highly impacted by urban pollution from Denver, as well as emissions from agricultural activities and oil and gas extraction. A box model is used to analyze the nocturnal nitrate radical chemistry and predict the N2O5 concentration. The uptake coefficient in the model is iterated until the predicted N2O5 concentration matches the measured concentration. The results suggest that during winter, the most important influence that might suppress N2O5 uptake is aerosol nitrate but that this effect does not suppress uptake coefficients enough to limit the rate of NOx loss through N2O5 hydrolysis. N2O5 hydrolysis was found to dominate the nocturnal chemistry during this study consuming similar to 80% of nocturnal gas phase nitrate radical production. Typically, less than 15% of the total nitrate radical production remained in the form of nocturnal species at sunrise when they are photolyzed and reform NO2.",,,,,,,,,80,6,0,0,16,0,91,,,2169-897X,2169-8996,,,,,,,,,,"NOAA, Earth Syst Res Lab, Boulder, CO 80305 USAUniv Colorado, Cooperat Inst Res Environm Sci, Boulder, CO 80309 USAUniv Washington, Dept Atmospher Sci, Seattle, WA 98195 USAUniv Washington, Dept Chem, Seattle, WA 98195 USAMem Univ Newfoundland, Dept Chem, St John, NF A1B 3X7, CanadaUniv Calif Riverside, Dept Environm Sci, Riverside, CA 92521 USAUniv Calif Irvine, Sch Phys Sci, Dept Earth Syst Sci, Irvine, CA USAAbant Izzet Baysal Univ, Dept Environm Engn, Bolu, TurkeyAppalachian State Univ, Dept Chem, Boone, NC 28608 USAUniv New Hampshire, Earth Syst Res Ctr, Durham, NH 03824 USA",,,,2013-08-27,WOS:000324933900040,,

Increases in salinity and phosphorus (P) accompanying saltwater intrusion into these freshwater, P-limited wetlands are expected to alter biogeochemical cycles along with the structure and function of plant and algal communities. Calcareous periphyton is a characteristic feature of karstic wetlands and plays a central role in trophic dynamics, carbon storage, and nutrient cycling. Periphyton is extremely sensitive to water quality and quantity, but the effects of saltwater intrusion on these microbial mats remain to be understood. We conducted an ex situ mesocosm experiment to test the independent and combined effects of elevated salinity and P on the productivity, nutrient content, and diatom composition of calcareous periphyton from the Florida Everglades. We measured periphyton total carbon, nitrogen, and P concentrations and used settlement plates to measure periphyton accumulation rates and diatom species composition. The light and dark bottle method was used to measure periphyton productivity and respiration. We found that exposure to similar to 1 g P center dot m(-2)center dot yr(-1) significantly increased periphyton mat total P concentrations, but had no effect on any other response variable. Mats exposed to elevated salinity (similar to 22 kg salt center dot m(-2)center dot yr(-1)) had significantly lower total carbon and tended to have lower biomass and reduced productivity and respiration rates; however, mats exposed to salinity and P simultaneously had greater gross and net productivity. We found strong diatom species dissimilarity between fresh- and saltwater-treated periphyton, while P additions only elicited compositional changes in periphyton also treated with saltwater. This study contributes to our understanding of how the ecologically important calcareous periphyton mats unique to karstic, freshwater wetlands respond to increased salinity and P caused saltwater intrusion and provides a guide to diatom indicator taxa for these two important environmental drivers.",,,,,,,,,2,0,0,0,1,0,2,,,1051-0761,1939-5582,,,,,,,,,,"Florida Int Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Miami, FL 33199 USAFlorida Int Univ, Southeast Environm Res Ctr, Miami, FL 33199 USA",,,,2020-03-03,WOS:000514013300001,31872508,

Once such models have been developed, the potential exists to use pulse response functions to characterize their behaviour. However, the application of response functions based on a pulse increase in atmospheric CO2 to characterize oceanic uptake, the conventional technique, does not yield a very accurate result due to nonlinearities in the aquatic carbon chemistry. Here, we propose the use of an ocean mixed-layer pulse response function that characterizes the surface to deep ocean mixing in combination with a separate equation describing air-sea exchange. The use of a mixed-layer pulse response function avoids the problem arising from the nonlinearities of the carbon chemistry and gives therefore more accurate results. The response function is also valid for tracers other than carbon. We found that tracer uptake of the HILDA and Box-Diffusion model can be represented exactly by the new method. For the Princeton 3-D model, we find that the agreement between the complete model and its pulse substitute is better than 4% for the cumulative uptake of anthropogenic carbon for the period 1765 to 2300 applying the IPCC stabilisation scenarios S450 and S750 and better than 2% for the simulated inventory and surface concentration of bomb-produced radiocarbon. By contrast, the use of atmospheric response functions gives deviations up to 73% for the cumulative CO2 uptake as calculated with the Princeton 3-D model. We introduce the use of a decay response function for calculating the potential carbon storage on land as a substitute for terrestrial biosphere models that describe the overturning of assimilated carbon. This, in combination with an equation describing the net primary productivity permits us to exactly characterize simple biosphere models. As the time scales of biospheric overturning are one key aspect to determine the amount of anthropogenic carbon which might be sequestered by the biosphere, we suggest that decay response functions should be used as a simple and standardized measure to compare different models and to improve understanding of their behaviour.

This raised the question of the short- and long-term health risks for the future bathers related to the toxicity of the remaining oil polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). This risk assessment study was conducted to help health authorities plan risk management policies and inform the public. Thirty-six beaches were selected, representing a sample of the most frequently encountered topographic and beach usage situations; seven control beaches, unspoiled by ERIKA, were also investigated. Samples of water and sand were taken from each site, as well as from the surface of rocks. The 16 PAHs selected by the U.S. EPA were quantified in each environment. Several scenarios of exposure were contemplated: (1) a child between 2 and 4 years accidentally ingesting a small ball of fuel, (2) a child daily exposed throughout his holiday-time stay, (3) an adult (including a pregnant woman) spending his/her holidays on the coast, (4) an adult working on the beach, (5) and an adult practicing water sports. Among the available and significant toxicological values, the most conservative ones were selected for computing risks.The sand and water, after decontamination, were slightly polluted (respectively, 7.8 mug/kg and 23.3 ng/l of total 16 PAHs), with values similar to those found in the control beaches. By contrast, the rocky areas in some places were still highly polluted (up to 23 mg/kg on the surface layer).No lethal risk was found for a young child who had accidentally ingested a small ball of fuel. The life-long excess risks for skin cancer and for all other cancers were about 10(-5) in scenarios including contact with the polluted rocks. In all other cases, excess risks were considerably lower. The hazard quotient for teratogenic effects was very small, except in scenarios where pregnant women would walk among rocks containing high pollution levels.In conclusion, exposure was mainly associated with polluted water among children, and with spoiled rocks for adults. Despite uncertainties, mainly dealing with the prediction of long-term risks following a short-term exposure, this study showed that beaches where pollution was no longer visible after decontamination did not entail any significant health risks and could be opened to the public.",,,,,,,,,10,0,0,0,8,0,12,,,0272-4332,,,,,,,,,,,"Inst Veille Sanitaire, F-94415 St Maurice, FranceInst Natl Environm & Ris Ind, F-60550 Verneuil En Halatte, France",,,,2003-12-01,WOS:000187527700007,14641894,

Hazards arising from scale formation and subsequent deposition include production system throughput reduction and eventually blockage. Among various types of scales, carbonates are among the most frequently observed scales in oilfield operations. Similar to many natural and industrial processes, co-precipitation of multiple scales can commonly be observed in oilfield operations. Although extensive research efforts have been made in the domain of understanding the thermodynamics of scale formation, there are limited studies to investigate the kinetic aspect of scale formation, particularly the kinetics of co-precipitation of multiple scales. In this study, the kinetic characteristics of CaCO3/BaCO3 co-precipitation have been experimentally investigated at representative oilfield conditions of 80 degrees C and 1 M NaCl condition. The focus was given to the investigation of the impact of different brine chemistry conditions such as mineral saturation level and Ca to Ba molar ratio. The experimental results suggest that CaCO3 saturation level, substrate material and molar ratio can impact the nature and morphology of the carbonate scales formed. An elevation of CaCO3 saturation index from 0.6 to 2 will change the formed carbonate solids from calcite to aragonite. In addition, at a Ca:Ba molar ratio of 1:15 with an excessive aqueous Ba species available, Ba species can partition into CaCO3 crystal lattice to distort CaCO3 lattice, resulting in almost 2-fold increase in aqueous Ca concentration.

Under N-limitation, many microalgae species change their carbon storage patterns in favor of neutral lipids (NLs) mainly in the form of triacylglycerol (TAG), but fatty acids in polar lipids (PL) are nutritionally more available for fish than those esterified into NLs. In the present study, the effect of N-limitation on the lipid content and fatty acid profiles in different lipid classes of Phaeodactylum tricomutum, lsochrysis aft galbana clone T-Iso, Rhodomonas baltica, and Nannochloropsis oceanica were investigated. The microalgae cells were cultivated by two different methods, batch and semi-continuous culture, to create strong and moderate N-limitation, and this in turn will significantly affect the biomass and lipid productivity. All four species accumulated lipids mainly in the form of TAG, in response to strong nitrogen limitation. N. oceanica, however, accumulated 51% of the dry weight as lipid in moderate nitrogen limitation and up to 87% of the fatty acid was in TAG. lsochrysis aff. galbana clone T-Iso was the only species where the fraction of polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUPA), especially the fraction of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), increased with increasing nitrogen limitation. Total lipid productivity showed no increase in batch culture although stronger nitrogen limitation led to lipid accumulation. P tricomutum had the highest eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) content, while N. oceanica showed the highest EPA productivity due to the high content of lipid. The highest DHA productivity was found in Isochiysis aff. galbana clone T-Iso from moderate N-limitation, mainly due to the high biomass productivity. Based on the results from the current study, N. oceanica and T-Iso are two promising microalgae strains ass long-term sustainable sources of n-3 long chain -PUFAs under moderate N-limitation. As shown in the present study, increased lipid content in microalgal cells due to strong N-limitation induction may not increase the lipid productivity because biomass production is usually reduced. Therefore, a combination of approaches such as metabolic engineering, conditioning and selection may be needed to further increase the n-3 LC-PUFA productivity without substantial loss of biomass.",,,,,,,,,71,0,0,0,45,2,75,,,,2296-7745,,,,,,,,,,"Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol NTNU, Dept Biol, Trondheim, NorwayNorwegian Univ Sci & Technol NTNU, Dept Biotechnol & Food Sci, Trondheim, NorwaySINTEF Ocean, Trondheim, NorwayBioMar AS, Trondheim, Norway",BioMar AS,,,2019-04-10,WOS:000462713400001,,

Following field observations in a recent macrotidal environment, the Mont-Saint-Michel Bay, and in an ancient formation, the Miocene marine molasse of the subalpine foreland basin of Digne, vertical records of the different tidal cycles (of neap/spring, of high spring/low spring and of equinox/solstice) have been demonstrated and characterised.

Fossil fuels will continue to contribute a large fraction of energy production in the near and intermediate future, making carbon capture and storage an important part of the solution. System studies show that oxy-combustion can play an important role in capturing CO2 efficiently when applied to power systems, because its efficiency and electricity prices are competitive with other low carbon energy. Gas-phase oxy-combustion, diluted with CO to control the flame temperature, utilizes conventional off-the-shelve technology. However, the combustion process exhibits characteristics different than those of air combustion because of the chemical activity of CO2, which impacts the combustor design. We summarize these characteristics. It also suffers from an energy penalty associated air separation. Alternative oxygen production technologies includes ion-transport membranes, and chemical looping using metal oxides as oxygen carriers. These technologies, while still under development, can couple oxygen separation and combustion in one process, i.e., process intensification. While an extensive knowledge base exists for gas phase oxy-combustion, these alternative technologies that rely on surface and electrochemical processes are still in their early stages. We review some fundamentals related to defect chemistry, surface and electrochemical reaction models, and their coupling with internal diffusion and external heat and mass transport, the associated rate-limiting steps and how they impact reactor design and performance. The discussion is used to explain the choice of oxygen carriers for chemical looping, and different reactor designs are summarized. Recent progress in material synthesis and chemistry show promising trends especially using perovskites, mixed oxides and dual-phase materials, and asymmetric structures for membranes and oxygen carriers. ITMs and CLC are dual-use technologies as they lend themselves naturally to water and CO2 splitting and the production of fuels and chemicals, but different materials and reactors are needed. They also present opportunities to integrate/hybridize fossil fuel systems with alternative energy sources for power and fuel production. (C) 2018 The Combustion Institute. Published by Elsevier Inc.

It also will interact with pre-existing stressors such as native vegetation clearing, altered natural disturbance regimes and invasive species - all of which already have major negative effects on biota in Australia. Strategies to reduce climate change impacts on Australian biodiversity include a mixture of mitigation and adaptation actions (sensu Millar et al., 2007) such as: (1) significantly reducing greenhouse gas emissions, (2) ensuring bio-diverse carbon capture, (3) better tackling pre-existing stressors on biodiversity, (4) better preparing for the effects of major natural disturbances, (5) significantly improving off-reserve conservation efforts including fostering appropriate connectivity, and (6) enhancing the existing reserve system by making it more comprehensive, adequate and representative. The first strategy above demands a global response otherwise major mitigation attempts in Australia that are not paralleled elsewhere around the world will have little effect on climate change and, in turn, contribute little to enhanced biodiversity conservation. Strategies 2-6 demand multi-scaled responses, particularly at a regional level, given the major regional differences in direct climate change impacts and their interactions with pre-existing regional stressors. Well developed multi-scaled conservation plans to implement these strategies currently do not exist, nor do appropriate institutional arrangements and capacities.

On 19 January 1996, the North Cape oil tanker caught fire and grounded on the coast of Rhode Island resulting in the spill of 828,000 gal (3134 metric tonnes) of home heating oil. It resulted in the estimated death of nearly 2300 birds, including a projected 402 common loons (Gavia immer) and 12 red-throated loons (Gavia stellata). Based on existing demographic data, a resource equivalency analysis (REA) calculated that the total loss, as measured through dead adults and their foregone young over their expected lifetimes, was 2920 discounted loon-years. To generate compensatory loon years, it was initially estimated that 25 common loon nests would need protection from development for 100 years. Following a $3 million settlement with the parties responsible for the spill, we conducted surveys to identify the highest quality breeding loon habitat for protection. Monitoring efforts included 184 loon territories from 2000 to 2009, representing 866 loon territory-years on 70 lakes in four regions of Maine. To evaluate restoration effectiveness, an updated REA was conducted using productivity data collected from these surveys. Results from the updated REA indicated that were these site-specific data available when the REA was originally generated, 70 nests would have been required to offset the lost loon-years - this project permitted the protection of 119 nests. Future REAs should incorporate site specific productivity data whenever possible to most accurately scale restoration to injury. Ranking lake habitat quality further optimizes restoration effectiveness. Our results indicate breeding success was highest on 24-81 ha lakes and that emphasizing protection of lakes with loon territories in this size class is optimal. Our results demonstrate a need for site-specific restoration plans to achieve the greatest restoration benefits. (c) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

However, so far this technique has not been widely exploited in other coastal applications, such as underwater archaeology. Submerged settlements and shipwrecks are often located in water depths where the application of multispectral satellite data is feasible. This could lead to more efficient field work practices thus enabling more optimal allocations of costs and labour during archaeological excavations. This study explores the contribution of processed satellite bathymetry maps to the recording of two archaeological coastal sites: a submerged prehistoric settlement in Greece and a shipwreck of a modern cargo vessel in Italy. The results indicate that even though the accuracy of satellite derived bathymetry is high, the level of detail (spatial resolution) is not sufficient to fully replace field-based measurements. However, the use of satellite data complements the existing techniques and can help to place the archaeological sites within a broader spatial context as well as to efficiently monitor the deterioration of a site due to natural causes or human activity, which inevitably leads to risk management. When the study of larger objects is involved (for example First World War shipwrecks) the potential of using satellite data in underwater archaeological studies becomes more promising.",,,,,,,,,9,0,0,0,2,0,10,,,2300-6560,,,,,,,,,,,"European Space Agcy, ESA Ctr Earth Observat ESRIN, Via Galileo Galilei,Casella Postale 64, I-00044 Rome, ItalyDHI GRAS, Agern Alle 5, DK-2970 Horsholm, DenmarkHIMA, Saripolou 9st, Athens 10682, GreeceReg Siciliana, Dipartimento Beni Culturali & Identita Siciliana, Via Lungarini 9, I-90133 Palermo, ItalyCodevintec Italiana Srl, Via Labus 13, I-20147 Milan, Italy",HIMAReg SicilianaCodevintec Italiana Srl,,,2017-07-17,WOS:000404614100018,,

In addition to concerns about risks to water quantity and quality, in Canada, shale gas development has highlighted how the Crown (federal and provincial governments) continues to struggle in its approach to honor, respect, and uphold Nation-to-Nation relationships with Indigenous peoples. But moving beyond the criticism, we argue that these circumstances have provided a renewed opportunity to explore alternative governance approaches. Existing water governance challenges are exacerbated by historical injustices generated by resource management approaches that have exposed Indigenous nations to disproportionate environmental risks. Furthermore, the inadequacy of current water governance approaches to recognizing Indigenous rights, self-determination, ways of knowing, and values has been well established in literature relating to environmental governance and Indigenous peoples. Given these circumstances, if water is allocated to hydraulic fracturing in Canada with continued disregard for Indigenous rights and risks, we contend that this only further intensifies unjust environmental and cultural harm to Indigenous peoples. In the quest for solutions, we discuss the challenges to alternative models (co-management, collaborative governance, and impact benefit agreements) that are frequently cited in environment-Indigenous literature. We conclude with recommendations to address the unresolved challenges inherent in these governance models, in the interest of improving water decision-making.

To extract useful information contained in the bit signal, a new extraction method based on empirical mode decomposition (EMD) is presented. In the signal processing, EMD is used to decompose the original drill bit vibration signal into the intrinsic mode functions (IMFs). By analyzing kurtosis and energy spectrum of the IMFs, the first five IMFs are found that contain the characteristic of the drill bit, and the specific frequency band of the bit vibration is determined after power spectrum analyzing. When the drill bit is approaching to the adjacent well, the reconstruction bit signal after band-pass filter changes significantly and agrees well with the on-site situation.",,,,,International Conference on Control Engineering and Communication Technology (ICCECT)International Conference on Control Engineering and Communication Technology (ICCECT),"DEC 07-09, 2012DEC 07-09, 2012",IEEE Comp SocIEEE Comp Soc,"Shenyang, PEOPLES R CHINAShenyang, PEOPLES R CHINA",1,0,0,0,0,0,1,,,,,978-1-4673-4499-9; 978-0-7695-4881-4,,,,,,,,,"China Univ Petr, Dept Petr Engn, Qingdao, Peoples R ChinaChina Natl Offshore Oil Corp, Res Ctr CNOOC, Beijing, Peoples R China",,,,2013-05-07,WOS:000316387300106,,

This study adopts a novel approach to assess the potential of these energy resources, in which information from multiple climatic indicators is coupled with socioeconomic drivers of energy development. Specifically, based on a daily dataset of the National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) Climate Forecast System Reanalysis (CFSR), three climate indicators were employed to characterize the frequency, intensity and duration of solar radiation and wind speed. Then, we introduced a new overall assessment index (OAI) based on these three climatic indicators to explore the best localities from a climatic perspective-for generating solar and wind energies. The validity of the recommended sites was discussed in the context of important physiographic, environmental, and socioeconomic constraints (e.g. population density, urban settlements, distance to water bodies, transportation network, etc.). Results demonstrate that both solar radiation and wind can be seen as promising and substantial alternative sources of fossil fuel resources in Oman, with almost 3.2% and 4.4% of the Omani territory being valid for a sustainable use of wind and solar radiation, respectively. The most recommended sites for wind generation are located mainly along Al-Jazir and Duqum coasts of southeastern Oman, where a promising wind energy center can be constructed. The best localities for the development of hybrid solar radiation generation centers are likely to be placed in Sohar and Thumrayt, where solar intensity approaches 8.1 kWh/m(2), with a high frequency of occurrence throughout the year. In contrast, Oman showed low potential to generate tidal power, mainly due to a low tidal range (<2 m) along the majority of the Omani coastline. This study provides a solid base for national and local decision makers in Oman for a reliable assessment, monitoring, and sustainable exploitation of clean and renewable energy resources, especially with high population growth, accelerated urbanization, and rapid economic growth over the past few decades, which can pose more challenges to future energy demand in this country.

These processes are critical in the case of the British Petroleum spill in the Gulf Coast since the identification of risks promises to have ramifications for multiple social actors, as well as the health status and long-term resilience of communities in the area. Qualitative interviews, ethnographic observations, and video data were collected with local social movement organizations, grassroots groups, spill workers, fisherman, local residents, scientists, and government representatives within five months of the spill. Findings suggest that crowdsourcing is a new form of citizen science reflecting a transition from lay mapping to an online data gathering system that allows a broader range of participation and the detection of a broader range of impacts. Outcomes of this research promise to help demonstrate and theorize how citizen science relates to risk assessment processes and affects disaster recovery and long-term response.",,,,,,,,,59,0,0,0,16,0,67,,,1708-3087,,,,,,,,,,,"George Washington Univ, Washington, DC 20052 USA",,,,2012-01-01,WOS:000313417400050,,

This paper surveyed the soil organic carbon (SOC) stock estimates and sequestration potentials from 20 regions in the world (New Zealand, Chile, South Africa, Australia, Tanzania, Indonesia, Kenya, Nigeria, India, China Taiwan, South Korea, China Mainland, United States of America, France, Canada, Belgium, England & Wales, Ireland, Scotland, and Russia). We asked whether the 4 per mille initiative is feasible for the region. The outcomes highlight region specific efforts and scopes for soil carbon sequestration. Reported soil C sequestration rates globally show that under best management practices, 4 per mille or even higher sequestration rates can be accomplished. High C sequestration rates (up to 10 per mille) can be achieved for soils with low initial SOC stock (topsoil less than 30 t C ha(-1)), and at the first twenty years after implementation of best management practices. In addition, areas which have reached equilibrium will not be able to further increase their sequestration. We found that most studies on SOC sequestration only consider topsoil (up to 0.3 m depth), as it is considered to be most affected by management techniques. The 4 per mille number was based on a blanket calculation of the whole global soil profile C stock, however the potential to increase SOC is mostly on managed agricultural lands. If we consider 4 per mille in the top 1m of global agricultural soils, SOC sequestration is between 2-3 Gt C year(-1) which effectively offset 20-35% of global anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions. As a strategy for climate change mitigation, soil carbon sequestration buys time over the next ten to twenty years while other effective sequestration and low carbon technologies become viable. The challenge for croppihg farmers is to find disruptive technologies that will further improve soil condition and deliver increased soil carbon. Progress in 4 per mille requires collaboration and communication between scientists, farmers, policy makers, and marketeers. (C) 2017 The Authors.

This technique utilizes frequency-receiver-shot (f-x-y) prediction filters to estimate the noise. The predicted filters can be applied in the f-x domain to remove noisy frequencies in seismic records. We have performed this exercise on a multi-channel seismic reflection dataset and the results indicate that noise from different sources has been successfully eliminated from the recorded datasets.

Two LR-75s and a 300 kHz Workhorse Sentinel ADCP (WHS-300) were deployed by ROV for three 1-month intervals in bottom tripods at 2000m depth approximately 65m away from the wellhead of an oil exploration rig. The ADCPs were oriented so that none of their acoustic beams intersected the rig's vertical riser. Single-ping ensembles were collected every 30 seconds in beam coordinates. The LR-75s were operated in Wideband and Narrowband mode, and with 32m and 16m bin lengths. Intercomparison current meters deployed on a 500m tall subsurface mooring about I km away included 5 Nortek AquaDopps, an Aanderaa RCM-11, and a 1200 kHz ADCP. Most of the instruments worked and gave apparently valid data, although significant differences in instrument performance were observed. Currents were nearly homogeneous in the vertical from approximately 100mab to 360mab, while frequency-dependent bottom intensification was observed below 100mab.A method of frequency-dependent intercomparison based on low-pass-filtered velocities was developed to improve the consistency of analysis results. This was necessary because the low current speeds (typically <10 cm/s) were near the noise threshold of the instruments, and because the vertical current shear was frequency-dependent.The density of acoustic scatterers was inferred from the AquaDopp current meters to be only slightly higher than that of deep Sargasso Sea water, and decreased with distance away from the sea floor. Despite the low density of scatterers, the LR-75 ADCPs gave apparently valid data out to a range of more than 350m above bottom, as evidenced by a gradient of Echo Amplitude and high Correlation Magnitude. However, LR-75 velocities were found to be significantly low-biased in all bins, out to the farthest measured range. The speed deficit ranged from nearly 100% in bins close to the ADCP, to more than 10% in bins several hundred meters away. The low bias error is inferred to be due to backscattering or reverberation of side lobe signals from the riser. The acoustic beam pattern of the 4-beam LR-75 is such that side lobe energy may be returned from a nearby vertical object, such as a riser, over many bins. The side lobe reflections or reverberations, although weak, are correlated with the transmitted signal but have zero Doppler shift When such correlated noise is mixed with the weak backscatter signal from scatterers; in the main beams, the ADCP reports a low-biased speed.Temporary removal of the oil rig's riser provided an opportunity to directly confirm the importance of side lobe interference. In the absence of the riser, LR-75 velocities were not low-biased compared to a reference current meter at comparable depth, whereas they were significantly low-biased immediately prior to removal of the riser.These results suggest that users of the LR-75 in a deep, low scattering environment where vertical non-moving objects are present should carefully consider these error sources and utilize ADCP bean configurations (such as disabling one beam) that minimize the strength of side lobe echoes in the other three beams and permit unbiased current measurements.",,,,,9th Working Conference on Current Measurement Technology9th Working Conference on Current Measurement Technology,"MAR 17-19, 2008MAR 17-19, 2008","IEEE Ocean Engn Soc, Current Measurement Technol CommIEEE Ocean Engn Soc, Current Measurement Technol Comm","Charleston, SCCharleston, SC",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,1085-7990,,978-1-4244-1485-7,,,,,,,,,"Woods Hole Grp Inc, E Falmouth, MA 02536 USA",Woods Hole Grp Inc,,,2008-01-01,WOS:000254888100014,,

A number of such models have been developed in ESR Technology's National NDT Centre (NNDTC) in the UK, at Iowa State University, in the USA and at other institutions. Such models allow better planning of POD trials, can generate POD estimates in their own right and enable the sensitivity to individual parameters to be assessed. The.); are also a Valuable training and set-up aid.Different methods are discussed that have evolved to take account of human error and environmental factors (HF) in the use of POD data front trials or model estimates. These methods arc, discussed in the context of the multiparameter POD and human reliability model developed in the European-American reliability workshops. Progress oil validation of these methods is discussed.These approaches are discussed and a number of specific examples are given. These include: (i) use of empirical human factor data such as from the PISC III or PANI III trials; (ii) use of models and simulators developed for ESA and HOIS to carry out simulated POD trials ('spot the flaw'); (iii) comparison of POD data from automated and manual inspections; and (iv) all axle simulator model which allows real crack indications to be added to A-scans from axles.

Life cycle assessment (LCA) methodology was used in this study to evaluate the impacts associated with CO2 capture from a natural gas combined cycle power plant, by using a scientific approach of process design and sizing of important unit operations. The environmental assessment was conducted for 90% and 80% CO2 capture efficiencies, using conventional monoethanolamine (MEA) and advanced solvent (KS-1), at various CO2 compression configurations. The results show a major reduction in greenhouse gas emission (GHG) for both capture efficiencies. For the 90% CO2 capture efficiency with conventional MEA, a reduction of 76% in GHG emission was achieved for the entire compression configuration. The 80% CO2 capture efficiency with conventional MEA, on the other hand, showed a 65% reduction in GHG emission. Using the KS-1 solvent resulted in a 78% reduction in GHG emission due to reduction in energy required for CO2 regeneration. However, the assessment shows that CO2 capture operations has led to an increase in other environmental impacts such as human toxicity potential, abiotic depletion, marine eutrophication potential, fresh water aquatic ecotoxicity, marine aquatic ecotoxicity, acidification, terrestrial ecotoxicity and photochemical oxidant formation potential. These impacts are mainly due to the additional energy required for the CO2 capture, infrastructures and chemical solvent used. The advantage of using the novel solvent (KS-1) is clear at 90% CO2 capture compared to the conventional MEA solvent. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

In addition to strong internal tide generation, steps and ridges give rise to the possibility of shadowing, wherein near-inertial energy is prevented from reaching depths beneath a characteristic intersecting the ridge top. A combination of two moored profilers and a long-range acoustic Doppler current profiler (ADCP) yielded velocity and shear measurements from 100 to 3640 m (60 m above bottom) and isopycnal depth, strain, and overturn-inferred turbulence dissipation rate from 1000 to 3640 m. Sampling intervals (20 min in the upper 1000 m and 1.5 h below that) were fast enough to minimize aliasing of higher-frequency internal-wave motions. The 67-day-long record is easily sufficient to isolate NIW and IT via bandpass filtering and to capture low-frequency variability in all quantities.No near-inertial shadowing was observed. Instead, energetic near-inertial waves were observed at all depths, radiating both upward and downward. A strong upward internal tide beam, showing a pronounced spring neap cycle, was also seen near the expected depth. Case studies of each of these are presented in depth and isopycnal-following coordinates. Except for immediately above the bottom and in the beam, where IT kinetic energy shows marked peaks, kinetic energy in the two bands is within a factor of 2 of each other. However, because of the redder NIW vertical wavenumber spectrum, NIW shear exceeded IT shear at all depths by a factor of 2-4. Dissipation rate was strongly enhanced in the bottom 1000 m and in the depth range of the internal tide beam. However, except for very near the bottom and possibly in one NIW event, no clear phase relationship was observed between dissipation rate and wave shear or strain, suggesting that turbulence occurs through a cascade process rather than by direct breaking at most locations.",,,,,,,,,63,2,0,0,9,0,72,,,0022-3670,1520-0485,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Washington, Appl Phys Lab, Seattle, WA 98105 USA",,,,2010-12-01,WOS:000286362800005,,

For this, it is required that the economy be researched towards its involvement in both emission inducement and abatement globally. The author adopts ecological footprint and offshored economic activities as proxies to both environment and foreign direct investment (FDI) in ascertainment of Turkish involvement in global emission and decarbonization. Structural break analysis, autoregressive distributed lag-bound testing, and Granger causality were utilized for the effective analysis of the offshore implication of environmental performance in Turkey. The author's findings are as follows: a positive relationship between economic performance (GDP per capita) and ecological footprint, hence giving credence to growth-induced pollution. Also, a positive relationship is established among foreign offshored economic activities (FDI), energy use, and ecological footprint which shows that both energy use and foreign offshored economic activities are positively related to the ecology which established unfavorable impact on the environment. This supports the pollution haven hypothesis (PHH) which is among the theoretical backgrounds of this study. Among the findings established in this study is from Granger causality method which supports the pollution haven hypothesis. They are as follows: a feedback causal transmission between FDI and the ecological footprint, and a one-way causal relationship passing from energy use to ecological footprint. With these findings, it can be said that the environmental implication of foreign offshored economic activities in Turkey is unfavorable. Policy implication of Turkey should be towards moderation of economic growth and the activities of foreign investors for sustainable energy, environment, and growth.",,,,,,,,,23,0,1,0,11,0,24,,,0944-1344,1614-7499,,,,,,,,,,"Istanbul Gelisim Univ, Fac Econ Adm & Social Sci, Istanbul, Turkey",,,,2020-07-16,WOS:000545065300005,32617824,

The project has involved multidisciplinary research by archaeologists, oceanographers, chemists and geoscientists and, apart from the valuable data it has yielded, particularly on the operation of the Dutch East India Company (VOC), it has served as a training ground for students in underwater excavation and has provided the opportunity of applying techniques that are unique to maritime archaeology, namely, the use of video images to record three-dimensional spatial relations of artefacts underwater and of a Geographic Information System for recording and interpreting data.It is also hoped that the project will generate an appreciation of the value of our underwater maritime heritage and thus go further towards protecting it from exploitation by salvors than legislation under the National Monuments Amendment Act has succeeded in doing.Shortage of funds threatens the continuation of the project, however, and the implementation of further phases, placing the Oosterland in its broader context and involving research into the origins of excavated artefacts, the demand for oriental products in seventeenth-century Europe, the complexity of inter-Asiatic trade and the intercontinental economic, political and social influence of VOC merchants, may not be possible unless reliable sources of funding are secured.",,,,,,,,,7,0,0,0,1,1,8,,,0038-2353,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1992-02-01,WOS:A1992HH80200010,,

The increase in the direct uses of CO2 and its conversion into potential chemical commodities is very important as it directly contributes to the mitigation of CO2 related global warming problem. The method being followed at present in several countries to reduce the CO2 associated global warming is capturing of CO2 at its major outlets using monoethanolamine based solution absorption technique followed by storing it in safe places such as, oceans, depleted coal seams, etc., (i.e., carbon dioxide capturing and storing in safe places, CCS process). This is called as CO2 sequestration. Although, the CCS process is the most understood and immediate option to mitigate the global warming problem, it is considerably expensive and has become a burden for those countries, which are practicing this process. The other alternative and most beneficial way of mitigating this global warming problem is to convert the captured CO2 into certain value added bulk chemicals instead of disposing it. Conversion of CO2 into methanol has been identified as one of such cost effective ways of mitigating global warming problem. Further, if H-2 is produced from exclusively water using only solar energy instead of any fossil fuel based energy, and is used to convert CO2 into methanol there are three major benefits: i) it contributes greatly to the global warming mitigation problem, ii) it greatly saves fossil fuels as methanol production from CO2 could be an excellent sustainable and renewable energy resource, and iii) as on today, there is no better process than this to store energy in a more convenient and highly usable form of high energy density liquid fuel. Not only methanol, several other potential chemicals and value added chemical intermediates can be produced from CO2. In this article, i) synthesis of several commodity chemicals including poly and cyclic-carbonates, sodium carbonate and dimethyl carbonate, carbamates, urea, vicinal diamines, 2-arylsuccinic acids, dimethyl ether, methanol, various hydrocarbons, acetic acid, formaldehyde, formic acid, lower alkanes, etc., from CO2, ii) the several direct uses of CO2, and iii) the importance of producing methanol from CO2 using exclusively solar energy are presented, discussed and summarized by citing all the relevant and important references.",,,,,,,,,17,0,0,0,1,0,19,,,0255-5476,,*****************,,,,,,,,,"Int Adv Res Ctr Powder Met & New Mat ARCI, Ctr Photoelectrochem PEC Cells, Hyderabad 500005, Andhra Pradesh, India",,,,2013-11-14,WOS:000325904100002,,

The PDG is installed in a remote undersea environment, which makes expensive the maintenance in case of fault. For this reason, PDG measurements are frequently unavailable. To overcome this limitation, the PDG pressure can be estimated using other available measurements. The estimation is not a simple task since, depending on process operational conditions, the multiphase flow might present limit cycles. In this work, Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) are proposed as potential techniques for the PDG pressure estimation. The comparison of the results shows that ANN returns precise estimation for a short-time window after the failure, but fails when a different process operating condition is applied, while EKF returns good estimation in all the cases.

To investigate this further two different scenarios were modelled. In the first, a single water production well was used to draw CO2 along the strike of an open aquifer with a regional dip. Large rates of water production (5-10 times the volume of injected CO2) were required to achieve only small displacements of the CO2 plume. The second scenario investigated to what extent an induced hydraulic gradient might spill CO2 already stored in a structural trap. Here the effects were more pronounced with over 90% of the CO2 being spilled at a water cycling rate of 10 Mt per year (corresponding to a hydraulic gradient of 1.28 bar/km). The modelling was tested by the real case at Sleipner where CO2 migration in the Utsira Sand is potentially impacted by water production at the nearby Volve field.

IMO limited marine fuel sulphur content in both Sulphur Emission Control Areas (SECAs) and Nitrogen Oxide Emission Control Areas (NECAs) to 0.1% (wt. %) by 2015, and to 0.5% globally by 2020. It is anticipated that the newly implemented IMO regulations will help to mitigate negative impact of ship emissions on public health and environment. IMO regulations require significant changes to refineries to increase the production of low sulphur fuels through a shift to distillates, use of novel deep desulphurization techniques, or fuel blending. Changes to the refinery processes can bring forth increases in greenhouse gas emissions and high capital investments. Alternative fuels will need to meet the required reduction of air pollutants and greenhouse gas emissions in coastal areas. Alternative marine fuels consisting of liquefied nature gas (LNG) and biofuel may be suitable fuels to meet both targets. These two fuels are predicted to account for 50% of shipping energy demand by 2050, while the remainder will still be supplied by conventional heavy fuel oil (HFO)/marine gas oil (MGO). Switching to low sulphur fuels as a results of the new IMO regulations has led to measureable reductions in ship emissions generally.

The aim of this paper was to evaluate growth, total sEPS production, and nutrient removal by the diatom Phaeodactylum tricornutum grown on POME under a range of experimental conditions (temperature, salinity, supplementation of extra nutrients). Phaeodactylum tricornutum was found to grow well on a range of POME concentrations, with 30% POME as optimum concentration. Nitrate and urea addition enhanced both growth rate and final biomass, whereas phosphate significantly stimulated growth only at low temperature. Box-Behnken response surface methodology revealed that interactions between temperature and salinity, and between temperature and urea influenced sEPS production. The highest total sEPS (140 mg L-1) concentration was recorded at 25 degrees C, 2.6% salinity, and 100 mg L-1 urea addition.

In order to replace fossil-based polymers, photoautotrophically produced polyhydroxybutryrates (PHBs), which are intracellular carbon storage products of nutrient-deprived microorganisms, seem to be a promising, biobased and biodegradable alternative. Although laboratory and pilot scale experiments have already been performed, no economic evaluation has been carried out so far. Consequently, valid claims on PHB production costs and the influence of different parameters, such as intracellular PHB-content, choice of cultivation system or location, cannot be made. In this study potential demonstration plants, equipped with different photoautotrophic cultivation systems and located at two sites, were designed to identify key parameters for a successful economic realization and implementation. Material and energy balances were determined to reveal specific PHB production costs for four different scenarios. Raw material and operating supply costs, expenditures for plant construction and operation as well as product amounts were determined using literature data for specified results from laboratory and pilot scale experiments. The lowest calculated PHB production price (24 (sic) kg(-1)) accomplished in a thin-layer-system plant located in Southern Europe with 60% PHB-content of the produced biomass is significantly higher than the current market price of heterotrophically produced PHB. The most important cost factors in all scenarios are cultivation and harvesting costs accounting for 62 to 72% of the total specific production costs, followed by maintenance costs with a cost share of 11 to 14%. Therefore, the choice of a suitable cultivation system is the key driving factor for an economic PHB-production due to the currently high investment costs for photosynthetic biomass production systems.

However, forests store the most carbon when they remain undisturbed and are allowed to grow to maturity, whereas using wood for bioenergy requires wood removal from forests, which reduces on-site carbon storage. Hence, it is difficult to manage a forest simultaneously for maximum carbon storage and supplying fuelwood.For developing optimal strategies for the use of vegetation sinks, it is necessary to consider the feedbacks via the inherent natural adjustments in the global carbon cycle. Increased atmospheric CO2 currently provides a driving force for carbon uptake by natural carbon reservoirs, such as the world's oceans. When carbon is removed from the atmosphere and stored in biomass, it lowers the concentration gradient between the atmosphere and these other reservoirs. This reduces the subsequent inherent rate Of CO2 removal from the atmosphere. This means that transferring a quantity Of CO2 from the atmosphere to a biomass pool lowers the atmospheric concentration the most immediately after the initial removal, but subsequently, the atmospheric concentration trends back towards the values without biospheric removal.The optimal timing for the use of vegetation sinks therefore depends on a number of factors: the length of time over which forest growth can be maintained, whether biomass is used for energy generation and on the nature of the most detrimental aspects of climate-change impacts. Climate-change impacts related to-the instantaneous effect of temperature are mitigated less by vegetation sinks than impacts that act via the cumulative effect of increased temperature. It also means that short-term carbon storage in temporary sinks is not generally beneficial in mitigating climate change. Crown Copyright (C) 2002 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.

Because it represents a prospective alternative energy source, it is necessary to use the energy return on investment method to evaluate production efficiency. The results show that the average standard energy return on investment is 0.74, the energy return on investment within the boundary from wellhead to processing is 0.58. and the energy return on investment within the boundary from well to utilization is 0.56. The negative net energy suggests that natural gas hydrate is not presently a favourable choice to replace conventional energy sources; thus, the large-scale development of natural gas hydrate requires further technological development. Sensitivity analysis shows that to acquire a strong positive energy return on investment, technological developments must be accompanied by simultaneous increases in ultimate gas recovery and the gas-to-water ratio. Moreover, the choice of proper production methods has an important influence on energy return on investment and should be based on the knowledge of physical properties gained through sufficient geological surveys.

Motivated by Brazil's large territory and population size, wide-ranging geographic features, and economic and social issues, we intend to solve problems related to security and environment. This INCT will address some of these challenges by proposing novel networked robotic systems for underwater maintenance, automobile and cargo transportation grow crops, remote inspection and actuation, and surveillance. Oil extraction in the pre-salt layer, located 250Km from the coast and more than 2 km deep in the ocean, has demanded specific solutions in terms of logistics, maintenance in deep waters, remote operations of platforms, and national security. Urban mobility has been faced with an expressive growing in the number of automobiles in the last years, the Brazilian car fleet is now the 4th in the world, car manufacturers and robotics researchers have been interested in partial or full automation of vehicles navigation systems. In terms of Amazon rainforest and Agriculture, Brazil has the important and complementary objectives in terms of preservation and to increase crop productivity. Advances in communication, computing, and embedded control technologies allow the application of networked systems to large environmental monitoring and coordination of multiple mobile agents for exploration and manipulation. The latest advances in systems theory and emerging information technology to enable the design and implementation of distributed networks for observation, mobility, and manipulation provide the fundamental scope of actual problems we intend to solve. Specifically, this proposal will consider autonomous navigation of aerial vehicles in low altitude to deal, for instance, with power transmission line and gas pipe inspection to alleviate the pilot's workload and with motion planning strategies for aggressive landing of an actual cargo transportation helicopter in a mobile platform; robotic systems based on lighter-than-air vehicles for environmental monitoring, surveillance and communication applied to the Amazon region.

However, due to high oil viscosity and significant formation heterogeneity, it is necessary to further improve the displacement effectiveness of polymer flooding in heavy oil reservoirs in the service life of offshore platforms. In this paper, the effects of the water/oil mobility ratio in heavy oil reservoirs and the dimensionless oil productivity index on polymer flooding effectiveness were studied utilizing relative permeability curves. The results showed that when the water saturation was less than the value, where the water/oil mobility ratio was equal to 1, polymer flooding could effectively control the increase of fractional water flow, which meant that the upper limit of water/oil ratio suitable for polymer flooding should be the value when the water/oil mobility ratio was equal to 1. Mean while, by injecting a certain volume of water to create water channels in the reservoir, the polymer flooding would be the most effective in improving sweep efficiency, and lower the fractional flow of water to the value corresponding to Delta J(max). Considering the service life of the platform and the polymer mobility control capacity, the best polymer injection timing for heavy oil reservoirs was optimized. It has been tested for reservoirs with crude oil viscosity of 123 and 70 mPa s, the optimum polymer flooding effectiveness could be obtained when the polymer floods were initiated at the time when the fractional flow of water were 10 % and 25 %, respectively. The injection timing range for polymer flooding was also theoretically analyzed for the Bohai Oil Field utilizing relative permeability curves, which provided methods for improving polymer flooding effectiveness.",,,,,,,,,16,4,0,0,1,0,18,,,1672-5107,1995-8226,,,,,,,,,,"State Key Lab Offshore Oil Exploitat, Beijing 100027, Peoples R ChinaSouthwest Petr Univ, State Key Lab Oil & Gas Reservoir Geol & Exploita, Chengdu 610500, Sichuan, Peoples R ChinaPetroChina Southwest Oil & Gas Field Co, Res Inst Explorat & Dev, Chengdu 610041, Sichuan, Peoples R China",State Key Lab Offshore Oil Exploitat,,,2015-04-29,WOS:000352492500008,,

Water samples collected in July through December 2010 were subjected to definitive acute testing with both species. In A. bahia tests, total PAH concentrations for OWD exposures ranged from non-detect to 23.0 mu g L-1, while WAF exposures ranged from non-detect to 1.88 mu g L-1. Mortality was >20% in five OWD exposures with A. bahia and three of the WAF definitive tests. Total PAH concentrations were lower for M. belyllina tests, ranging from non-detect to 0.64 mu g L-1 and non-detect to 0.17 mu g L-1 for OWD and WAF exposures, respectively.

Effects on fishing success have been noted in a few studies indicating potential for temporary displacement of at least some fish populations. However (and as also indicated by other researchers) displacement through scaring of fish for a number of hours or a day should not, in perspective, pose a major problem. Adults, juveniles and eggs may also suffer immediate mortality within a few meters of a sound source. However it is sub lethal effects which are most difficult to deal with and serious physiological and anatomical damage may also be occurring at much greater depths in the field leading to a variety of injurious effects. There is virtually no information in this area and it needs to be addressed if only for assurance.Lobster is one of the most commercially important species in Atlantic Canada and it is important to have some knowledge on whether seismic poses a threat to lobster populations, and now more so, given recent interests for expanding seismic surveys in such areas, as the lobster rich and more shallow waters of the Gulf of St. Lawrence. Some pilot studies have now been carried out in the laboratory and field investigating the potential for effects of seismic on lobster health. The basic thrust of the studies was to explore for changes in various biological endpoints and identify those (if any) which might then require further assessment in a more comprehensive manner. A number of endpoints were assessed in animals exposed to a 'low level exposure -202 dB peak-to-peak and a high level exposure -227 dB peak-to-peak. The endpoints included (a) lobster survival (b) food consumption (c) turnover rate (d) serum protein (e) serum enzymes and (f) serum calcium. A small histopathological study was also carried out on lobsters from 1 of the 5 trials. Observations were often made over a period of a few days to several months.Exposure of lobster to very high as well as low sound levels had no effects on delayed mortality or damage to mechanosensory systems associated with animal equilibrium and posture, as assessed by turnover rates. There was also no evidence for loss of legs or other appendages. However sub-lethal effects were observed with respect to feeding and serum biochemistry with effects sometimes being observed weeks to months after exposure. A histochernical change was also noted in the hepatopancreas of animals exposed 4 months previously, which may be linked to organ 'stress'. These initial studies were meant to be exploratory in nature and caution is warranted about over interpretation. However, they do point to the need for more comprehensive studies regarding the potential for seismic surveys to affect lobster. Studies on moulting and effects on egg development and animal behavior are recommended. Such studies can be carried out in a cost effective manner through laboratory and small scale field experiments as used in the pilot investigations reported here.The difficulties in most instances of resolving seismic mediated impacts through studies on fish populations, short of major or catastrophic impacts, is also briefly discussed.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,0706-6457,,,,,,,,,,,"Fisheries and Oceans Canada, Sci Branch, POB 5667, St Johns, NF A1C 5X1, Canada",,,,2007-01-01,ZOOREC:ZOOR14309058459,,

J,,,,,,,,,"Peteet, Dorothy",,Collaborative Research: Long-term carbon storage shifts in high-latitude peatlands with paleoclimate change: Linking peatland modeling with paleoecology and paleohydrology,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Awarded Grant,Sep 01 2010,2010,"This is an iterative data-model investigation of the relationship between paleoclimate and long-term carbon accumulation from Alaskan arctic peatland archives. The hypothesis is that climate controls carbon storage in peatlands through shifts in temperature and moisture related processes of production and decomposition. Use of an existing set of peatland cores from two arctic regions from the late-glacial to the Holocene offers a variety of climate scenarios to examine carbon sequestration. For example, the group hypothesizes that warm, dry intervals result in peatland carbon storage decline, while cool, wet climates result in increased carbon sequestration. Using new tools, including compound-specific isotope and biomarker analysis, and existing traditional paleoclimate proxies such as pollen, macrofossils, and bryophytes, the researchers will produce detailed climate and hydrological reconstructions, and high resolution AMS-14C dating, C and bulk density measurements will provide carbon accumulation rates from the late-glacial to the present and enable the team to test their carbon sequestration-climate hypotheses using a newly-developed mechanistic peatland accumulation model. As high latitudes warm and arctic and subarctic peatlands provide positive and negative carbon feedbacks to the climate system, it is important to add the paleo-perspective to our understanding of magnitude and temporal and spatial scales. This research will couple detailed analysis of changes in paleoecology/paleoclimate (through bryophyte, compound-specific isotope analysis, pollen, and macrofossil analysis) in high latitude peatlands over the last glacial-interglacial cycle with quantification of carbon sequestration in different environments (i.e., wet vs. drier muskegs). These paleo-peatland histories will provide long-term carbon sequestration records, which can be used for comparisons with paleoclimate reconstructions from the same sediments, as well as ice cores, marine records, and lake stratigraphy. The independent paleoclimate data will be utilized by the new Holocene Peatland Model to simulate coupled carbon and water dynamics of northern peatlands at an annual time step over time scales of decades to millennia. The model-simulated carbon accumulation record can be then compared with the peatland histories, and differences evaluated in terms of plant composition, productivity, and decomposition. This iterative model-data research will provide long-term empirical information necessary to evaluate the role of the hydrological cycle in future wetland carbon cycling, and the past importance of climate and vegetation in sequestering carbon over millennia. The selected sites for new sampling include peatlands of Alaska?s North Slope at Toolik Lake where an extensive ecological database exists as well as the arctic foothills of the western Mesa site. AMS 14C ages, as well as Pb-210 and Cs-137, will be used in conjunction with C and bulk density to determine carbon accumulation for each site. Analysis of bryophyte and isotopes/biomarkers will provide defined moisture regimes as well as possible water chemistry changes due to volcanic ash deposition in these sites. Of particular interest are climatic intervals such as the Bolling-Allerod/Younger Dryas, the early Holocene, the Preboreal and 8200-yr events, mid-Holocene, the Neoglacial, Little Ice Age, and the last 50 years. This project will involve at least 4 undergraduate theses and one postdoc. The PI has a well-documented record of mentoring undergraduates and advising graduate students in field and lab-based programs, with many of her former advisees publishing their results in peer-reviewed journals. Students will have an opportunity to present results at the local, state, and national levels.

J,,,,,,,,,"Frolking, Steve",,Collaborative Research: Long-term carbon storage shifts in high-latitude peatlands with paleoclimate change: Linking peatland modeling with paleoecology and paleohydrology,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Awarded Grant,Sep 01 2010,2010,"This is an iterative data-model investigation of the relationship between paleoclimate and long-term carbon accumulation from Alaskan arctic peatland archives. The hypothesis is that climate controls carbon storage in peatlands through shifts in temperature and moisture related processes of production and decomposition. Use of an existing set of peatland cores from two arctic regions from the late-glacial to the Holocene offers a variety of climate scenarios to examine carbon sequestration. For example, the group hypothesizes that warm, dry intervals result in peatland carbon storage decline, while cool, wet climates result in increased carbon sequestration. Using new tools, including compound-specific isotope and biomarker analysis, and existing traditional paleoclimate proxies such as pollen, macrofossils, and bryophytes, the researchers will produce detailed climate and hydrological reconstructions, and high resolution AMS-14C dating, C and bulk density measurements will provide carbon accumulation rates from the late-glacial to the present and enable the team to test their carbon sequestration-climate hypotheses using a newly-developed mechanistic peatland accumulation model. As high latitudes warm and arctic and subarctic peatlands provide positive and negative carbon feedbacks to the climate system, it is important to add the paleo-perspective to our understanding of magnitude and temporal and spatial scales. This research will couple detailed analysis of changes in paleoecology/paleoclimate (through bryophyte, compound-specific isotope analysis, pollen, and macrofossil analysis) in high latitude peatlands over the last glacial-interglacial cycle with quantification of carbon sequestration in different environments (i.e., wet vs. drier muskegs). These paleo-peatland histories will provide long-term carbon sequestration records, which can be used for comparisons with paleoclimate reconstructions from the same sediments, as well as ice cores, marine records, and lake stratigraphy. The independent paleoclimate data will be utilized by the new Holocene Peatland Model to simulate coupled carbon and water dynamics of northern peatlands at an annual time step over time scales of decades to millennia. The model-simulated carbon accumulation record can be then compared with the peatland histories, and differences evaluated in terms of plant composition, productivity, and decomposition. This iterative model-data research will provide long-term empirical information necessary to evaluate the role of the hydrological cycle in future wetland carbon cycling, and the past importance of climate and vegetation in sequestering carbon over millennia. The selected sites for new sampling include peatlands of Alaska?s North Slope at Toolik Lake where an extensive ecological database exists as well as the arctic foothills of the western Mesa site. AMS 14C ages, as well as Pb-210 and Cs-137, will be used in conjunction with C and bulk density to determine carbon accumulation for each site. Analysis of bryophyte and isotopes/biomarkers will provide defined moisture regimes as well as possible water chemistry changes due to volcanic ash deposition in these sites. Of particular interest are climatic intervals such as the Bolling-Allerod/Younger Dryas, the early Holocene, the Preboreal and 8200-yr events, mid-Holocene, the Neoglacial, Little Ice Age, and the last 50 years. This project will involve at least 4 undergraduate theses and one postdoc. The PI has a well-documented record of mentoring undergraduates and advising graduate students in field and lab-based programs, with many of her former advisees publishing their results in peer-reviewed journals. Students will have an opportunity to present results at the local, state, and national levels. The group will continue its long leadership in science programs training high school students and teachers at NASA/GISS summer program for minorities and Columbia University?s Department of Earth and Environmental Science graduate and undergraduate students, as well as local outreach to museums and public programs. They intend to engage a K-12 teacher in their field and lab research in the Lamont Doherty Earth Observatory VAST (Visiting Arctic/subarctic Summer Teacher) program for far-ranging impact. Additionally, their analyses can be utilized for the Columbia University courses the PI teaches on Wetlands and Climate Change, Terrestrial Paleoclimate, as well as seminars in Plant Ecology and Paleoecology, and in courses the UNH PI teaches (Biogeochemistry and Environmental Modeling). The results and conclusions of this work will have implications for arctic climate policy, ecosystem management, and education.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,1021300,,,,,,,,University of New Hampshire,,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:13664246,,

Indonesian peatlands are subject to much greater anthropogenic activity than Peru's, including drainage, logging, agricultural conversion, and burning, resulting in high greenhouse gas and particulate emissions. To derive insights from the Indonesian experience, we explored patterns of impact in the two countries, and compared their predisposing factors. Impacts differ greatly among Indonesian regions and the Peruvian Amazon in the following order: Sumatra > Kalimantan > Papua > Peru. All impacts, except fire, are positively related to population density. Factors enhancing Indonesian peatlands' susceptibility to disturbance include peat doming that facilitates drainage, coastal location, high local population, road access, government policies permitting peatland use, lack of enforcement of protections, and dry seasons that favor extensive burning. The main factors that could reduce peatland degradation in Peru compared with Indonesia are geographic isolation from coastal population centers, more compact peatland geomorphology, lower population and road density, more peatlands in protected areas, different land tenure policies, and different climatic drivers of fire; whereas factors that could enhance peatland degradation include oil and gas development, road expansion in peatland areas, and an absence of government policies explicitly protecting peatlands. We conclude that current peatland integrity in Peru arises from a confluence of factors that has slowed development, with no absolute barriers protecting Peruvian peatlands from a similar fate to Indonesia's.

Unlike vertical wells, horizontal wells can extend several thousand feet into the formation. Reservoir heterogeneity and the length of the horizontal leg can make acid placement and diversion very difficult. In addition, the low drawdown encountered in horizontal wells results in longer times to lift the spent acid from the well, especially in tight formations.To achieve better acid diversion in horizontal wells drilled in carbonate reservoirs, a viscoelastic-surfactant-based system was used. The components of this new system are HCl and a visco-elastic surfactant. The acid dissolves calcite and dolomite minerals and produces calcium and magnesium chlorides. The increase in pH forces the surfactant molecules to form rod-shaped micelles. The produced chloride salts further stabilize these structures, especially at high temperatures. The rod-shaped micelles will significantly increase the viscosity of the acid, diverting the acid into tight, unstimulated, or severely damaged zones.More than 100 wells with openhole (OH) completions were successfully stimulated in two offshore oil fields in Saudi Arabia by use of the new acid system. With a water zone 30 ft away from these OH sections in one of the fields, growth of any dominant wormhole into these sections could increase water production. The wells that used the new treating fluid produced an average of 1,600 BOPD more than conventionally treated wells, with no indication of water production. Field results [pre- and post-oil and -water production rates and flowing wellhead pressure (FWHP)] demonstrate the effectiveness of the new acid system to matrix acidize long horizontal wells with OH completions. The simplicity of the system makes it the fluid of choice, especially in offshore and sour environments. The absence of metallic crosslinkers in this system eliminates problems associated with sulfide precipitation in sour wells.",,,,,2004 SPE International Symposium and Exhibition on Formation Damage Control2004 SPE International Symposium and Exhibition on Formation Damage Control,"FEB 18-20, 2004FEB 18-20, 2004",Soc Petr EngineersSoc Petr Engineers,"Lafayette, LALafayette, LA",16,1,0,0,0,0,19,,,1930-1855,1930-1863,,,,,,,,,,"Saudi Aramco, Stimulat Res & Technol Team, Dhahran, Saudi ArabiaUniv Alberta, Edmonton, AB T6G 2M7, CanadaSaudi Aramco, Khursaniyah Dev Dept, Dhahran, Saudi Arabia",,,,2006-08-01,WOS:000240451400002,,

The timing of the spill coincided with the spawning season of Crassostrea virginica. Consequently, gametes released in the water were likely exposed to oil and dispersant. This study aimed to (i) evaluate the cellular effects of acute exposure of spermatozoa and oocytes to surface slick oil, dispersed mechanically (HEWAF) and chemically (CEWAF), using flow-cytometric (FCM) analyses, and (ii) determine whether the observed cellular effects relate to impairments of fertilization and embryogenesis of gametes exposed to the same concentrations of CEWAF and HEWAF. Following a 30-min exposure, the number of spermatozoa and their viability were reduced due to a physical action of oil droplets (HEWAF) and a toxic action of CEWAF respectively. Additionally, reactive oxygen species (ROS) production in exposed oocytes tended to increase with increasing oil concentrations suggesting that exposure to dispersed oil resulted in an oxidative stress. The decrease in fertilization success (1-h), larval survival (24-h) and increase in abnormalities (6-h and 24-h) may be partly related to altered cellular characteristics. FCM assays are a good predictor of sublethal effects especially on fertilization success. These data suggest that oil/dispersant are cytotoxic to gametes, which may affect negatively the reproduction success and early development of oysters. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

We used a range of carbon sequestration values to measure carbon stock (T CO2e ha-1) in 2016 (start of modeling), 2030, 2060, and 2100. We chose these time points because they are commonly used in coastal planning horizons. We also measured carbon sequestration (T CO2e ha-1) between these time points. We estimated the net present value (USD) of carbon sequestration (removal of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere) as an ecosystem service at 2030, 2060, and 2100. We used two metrics of valuation: (1) price of one metric ton of carbon on the California Carbon Exchange (assuming the cost of carbon remained stable over the analysis period), (2) the Social Cost of Carbon, or the cost of societal damages from each additional ton of carbon in the atmosphere. We generated raster layers for each carbon modeling output using the InVEST Coastal Blue Carbon Model from the Natural Capital Project. For each location, time horizon, and high/low estimate, we created one raster for each of the four carbon metrics described above. We listed these output rasters in a CSV spreadsheet with details on which modeling scenario they correspond to and their file paths. All rasters were originally projected in NAD_1983_Albers using ArcMap. We modeled several alternative scenarios for the future of tidal marshes. For all three case study locations, we projected the values of carbon metrics if the marsh extent were to remain stable across the modeling period. This was referred to as the No Change scenario. For Humboldt Bay, we modeled the restoration of McDaniel Slough (McDaniel Slough Restoration scenario).

In addition, hydrocarbons have several potential uses. This paper formulates an optimization model that assists the government in these challenges. Given an initial estimated reserve volume and hydrocarbon price, the model determines values for both the PSC's key parameters and the allocation of the government share into different uses to generate the maximum benefit to the state while providing an acceptable rate of return for the IOC. The model is applied to Lebanon. We find that an optimal PSC for Lebanon involves no royalty for all reasonable values of potential reserves, and a high cost recovery and profit share for low reserve volumes.

Nonetheless, the organic chemistry of both P. oceanica plant materials, as well as the environmental and diagenetic effects on the composition of its detritus, is poorly understood. We analyzed plant organs of P. oceanica and the coarse organic matter from a mat core spanning 750 yrs using pyrolysis techniques (PY-GC-MS and THM-GC-MS) to improve our understanding of their molecular properties and their preservation upon mat development. It appeared that leaf sheaths, roots and the outer parts of rhizomes were composed predominantly of phenolic constituents based on p-hydroxybenzoic acid (p-HBA), which is atypical for vascular plants, in addition to carbohydrates and lignin. The inner rhizome and leaf blades had a different composition, with predominance of carbohydrates. The seagrass detritus in the mat was composed mainly of p-HBA phenolic material and carbohydrates, confirming earlier studies showing that the coarse detritus in the mat originates largely from Posidonia sheath, root and rhizome debris. The intermolecular arrangement of the p-HBA remains unclear, as they seem to correspond to ester-bound phenols yet their persistence in the mat attributes them a refractory nature. Variations in molecular composition within the mat are probably associated with diagenetic alteration of P. oceanica detritus, such as the decomposition of minor amounts of fatty acids, chlorophyll and syringyl lignin, and selective preservation of p-HBA relative to carbohydrates. This work lays the foundations for a molecular understanding of carbon storage within the mats and the environmental changes recorded therein. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

The high health risks of non-communicable diseases and relevant comorbidities in Africa, particularly in contaminated areas like e-waste and crude oil and gas exploration areas and for high consumers of food commodity groupings which are most critical for PAH exposure, are exacerbated by dietary exposure due to unsafe practices in commonly consumed foods, like those street vended.In February 2016, 20 commonly consumed street foods were purchased directly from vendors at major bus stops in Benin City and Umunede in Nigeria. The concentration of 16 priority PAHs was determined. The dietary intake of B[a]P, aPAH, PAH4, PAH8, and aB(a)P-eq was estimated for children, peripubertal children/adolescent, and adult using the total diet study (TDS) method. Among the analyzed PAHs, there was a predominance of chrysene (17.42 mu g/kg). Roasted yam (14.15 mu g/kg) and fried fish (1.40 mu g/kg) had the highest levels of aPAH and B[a]P, respectively. The mean concentration of B[a]P, aPAH, PAH4, PAH8, and aB(a)P-eq ranged from 0.65-1.40 mu g/kg, 0.20-14.15 mu g/kg, 0.43-5.22 mu g/kg, 0.13-7.88 mu g/kg, and 0.002-2.123 mu g/kg, respectively. The mean concentration of B[a]P and PAH4 reported in this study was below the maximum allowable levels of 5 and 12 mu g/kg for adults and above the maximum levels for young children set at 1.0 mu g/kg for both B[a]P and PAH4 in food. The estimated dietary intake of B[a]P, aPAH, PAH4, PAH8, and aB(a)P-eq for adult, adolescent, and children was 0.56, 0.37, and 0.31 mu g/day; 17.6, 10.7, and 8.81 mu g/day; 5.78, 4.01, and 3.26 mu g/day; 9.22, 6.19, and 5.09 mu g/day; and 1.72, 0.97, and 0.82 mu g/day, respectively.Street foods represent one important source of PAHs. The exposure occurring through street food compounds with that from home-made foods, environmental pollution, and lifestyle (tobacco smoke) is making up an aggregate daily exposure in the general population.The incremental lifetime cancer risk for adults and children from the consumption of street food was 7.6 x 10(-8) and 2.1 x 10(-8), respectively. Along with initiatives to manage environmental contamination and promote healthier lifestyle, people should be empowered on healthy cooking practices and safe food cookery environments.",,,,,,,,,16,0,0,0,10,0,16,,,0944-1344,1614-7499,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Port Harcourt, Fac Pharm, Dept Expt Pharmacol & Toxicol, Port Harcourt, Rivers State, NigeriaNnamdi Azikiwe Univ, Fac Sci, Dept Chem, Awka, Anambra State, NigeriaIst Super Sanita, Dept Cardiovasc Dysmetab & Aging Associated Dis, Via Giano della Bella 34, I-00162 Rome, Italy",Nnamdi Azikiwe Univ,,,2018-03-09,WOS:000425971700046,29218577,

The answer to these questions is significant as it dictates the reliability of the carbon stock estimate and estimation cost, and can guide the design of efficient urban green infrastructure. This study aims to assess the carbon storage capacities of plants, their biophysical parameters important to the carbon stock by plant type, and the influence of parameter thresholds on carbon estimate and sampling load. In total, 1,681 woody plants were surveyed in 20 plots in Auckland parks and reserves. Trees (51%), shrubs (22%), and ferns (27%) co-existed spatially, and stored 115.30, 2.05, and 5.94 Mg C, respectively, at a ratio of 19.4:0.3:1. On average, a tree, shrub, and fern/palm stored 138.09 +/- 333.7, 5.59 +/- 6.0, and 13.36 +/- 15.5 kg C per plant. The top five carbon-contributing tree species were exotic pines (29.1%), kauri (9.8%), rimu (3.8%), kahikatea (2.9%), and matai (2.1%). Matai should be the choice in revegetation projects to maximise carbon stock given its unparalleled carbon contribution index (17.2). Stem length was totally ineffective in indicating plant carbon, followed by canopy area. Diameter at breast height (DBH) was a better indicator of tree and shrub carbon. Total vegetation carbon would be underestimated by 3.7% if a DBH threshold of >= 10 cm were adopted for trees, and >= 14 cm for shrubs and ferns, all causing the carbon stock of the respective plant type to be underestimated by about 1.60 Mg C. However, these thresholds would reduce the overall sampling load by 47.2%. The established relationship between DBH and cumulative carbon allows calibration of the estimated carbon in accordance with the DBH threshold adopted in sampling different plants. Whether the amount of calibration still holds true in other types of urban plants requires further study.",,,,,,,,,4,0,0,0,3,0,4,,,1618-8667,1610-8167,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Auckland, Sch Environm, Auckland, New Zealand",,,,2020-12-08,WOS:000591909200011,,

Typically, shallower water fields are highly congested with manmade infrastructure, as well as a significant marine life presence, which can pose a problem for drilling operations in harsh environments. Conventional catenary rig systems, composed of wire and/or chain fair well in these water depths, but require significant grounded length. However, taut systems (synthetic or wire rope) require little contact with the seafloor, but often do not produce the desired survivability.The increased survivability of conventional catenaries in shallower waters is attributed to the stiffness of the mooring system. Taut systems are stiffer than catenary systems that contain similar components (ie. all wire and chain, or steel and polyester). However, the deeper the water, the longer the overall mooring line lengths, which causes the mooring system stiffnesses to converge as mooring line weight becomes the dominant factor. Similarly, the less total mooring component length in the system, the closer the systems come in total weight, causing the difference in system stiffnesses to be the dominant factor. The ideal mooring system for shallower water depths should include the positives of using a steel catenary and a polyester taut system, while reducing the negatives of each system.MODUline (R) Polyester Rope has similar strength to weight ratios as conventional polyester mooring rope, but provides significant increases in elasticity. Preliminary data for linear mooring stiffness comparisons of MODUline (R) Polyester Rope with typical polyester rope of similar break strength is shown in Table 1. Typically, MODU offsets from environmental loading are dominated by mean loads. As shown in Table 1, the mean stiffness of MODUline (R) Polyester Rope is comparable to that of traditional polyester rope, which indicates comparable vessel offsets under the same environmental loading conditions. However, wave frequency stiffnesses are significantly different between the two ropes, signifying a drastic decrease in dynamic tensions on mooring equipment attached to MODUline (R) Polyester Rope over conventional polyester rope. This elasticity, when introduced to a taut polyester mooring system, can dramatically improve system survivability, while maintaining a smaller subsea footprint.[GRAPHICS]This study will examine the benefits of various lengths of MODUline(R) Polyester inserts into taut mooring lines to determine the overall impact on survivability and operability of a moored MODU in a wave-dominant environment. This will be accomplished through the utilization of the ANSYS AQWA software suite to examine a generic MODU hull at 1,000-ft and 3,000-ft water depths, with varying lengths of MODUline(R) Polyester and conventional polyester in taut mooring systems at each water depth. Diffraction and radiation analyses of the hydrostatic MODU hull will be performed at each water depth to obtain vessel hydrostatic properties, depth-specific RAO's, and wave drift force coefficients. The metocean parameters for a region of the North Sea around the Shetland Islands will be used for the limit-state operational and survival analyses. Nonlinear stiffness data will be incorporated into the mooring analyses to more accurately gauge MODU passive offsets at each return period. All of the mooring systems will have high initial horizontal fairlead tensions for greater station keeping during drilling operations. The ANSYS AQWA analysis will consist of a 6-degree of freedom frequency domain coupled motion mooring analysis, accounting for vessel motions, mooring line dynamics, and their interactions.All results from this study will be post-processed to portray the comparisons between each polyester rope type at each water depth.",,,,,Washington State Conference and Trade Center (WSCTC)Washington State Conference and Trade Center (WSCTC),"SEP 20-23, 2010SEP 20-23, 2010",IEEE; Marine Technol; OESIEEE; Marine Technol; OES,"Seattle, WASeattle, WA",1,0,0,0,0,0,1,,,0197-7385,,978-1-4244-4333-8,,,,,,,,,"Delmar Syst Inc, 2424 Wilcrest Dr,Suite 225, Houston, TX 77042 USALankhorst Euronete Rope SA, PL-4490 Povoa De Varzim, Portugal",Delmar Syst IncLankhorst Euronete Rope SA,,,2010-01-01,WOS:000287539100095,,

However, evidence for indirect effects of forest fragmentation on above - and belowground carbon pools through changes in forest biodiversity is scarce. Here we focus on understanding the relative importance of taxonomic and functional diversity and tree cover to explain above- and below-ground carbon stocks in coastal dune forest fragments. We surveyed tree species composition and structure in six coastal forest patches varying in size from 215 to 13350 ha, in Kwa-Zulu Natal, South Africa. For each fragment, we estimated carbon stocks of two pools, aboveground biomass (AGC) and soil organic carbon (SOC). We used structural equation models to test if and to what extent the effects of forest fragmentation on AGC and SOC were mediated by tree cover and taxonomic and functional diversity. Our results showed that forest fragmentation directly reduced AGC, but increased SOC. In contrast, forest fragmentation indirectly, through decreasing functional diversity, increased AGC, but decreased SOC. Small patches therefore had few tree species that were functional similar and had high AGC, but low SOC, which led to a negative relationship between species richness and AGC. Tree cover was not affected by fragmentation, and had a direct positive effect on AGC but not on SOC. Our results suggest that forest fragmentation simultaneously affect multiple processes which directly and indirectly affects carbon stocks of different pools. Fragmentation may trigger a process of biotic homogenization, in which a few species are positively related with carbon storage above-, but not below ground.",,,,,,,,,19,0,0,0,15,0,19,,,0378-1127,1872-7042,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Pretoria, Conservat Ecol Res Unit, ZA-0028 Pretoria, South AfricaNewcastle Univ, Sch Biol, Newcastle NE1 7RU, Tyne & Wear, England",,,,2018-01-01,WOS:000418214300020,,
J,,,,,,,,,Mike Clare,,New field-scale calibration for turbidity current impact modelling,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Awarded Grant,Nov 01 2016,2016,"Subsea infrastructure networks underpin our daily lives, providing critical global communication links and supporting our demand for energy supplies. These strategically important networks are vulnerable to fast-moving seafloor flows of sediment, known as turbidity currents. Such flows have previously broken important subsea cable connections; leading to £Ms in lost financial trading and repair costs. The seafloor cable network transfers >95% of all global communications traffic. The International Cable Protection Committee (represented by partner Carter) has a vested interest in understanding the risk of turbidity currents, but there is a paucity of direct field measurements of turbidity currents. Thus, numerical models are largely based on scaled down experimental studies. Here, we show how the first deep-ocean high resolution measurements of turbidity currents can enable improved understanding of the risk posed, through calibration of numerical models for impact analysis. This will directly benefit partners Chevron and Shell, who are responsible for ensuring safe operation of multi-£M seafloor oil and gas pipelines worldwide. Loss of hydrocarbons to the environment can have severe environmental and reputational implications; hence minimising the risk of a pipe rupture is important. Improvements to modelling will be immediately taken up by partner HR Wallingford, who advise a wide range of owners and stakeholders on hazard assessment for seafloor infrastructure. We aim to address the following questions: [1] How can emerging direct monitoring technology lead to a step-change in assessment of turbidity current risk to offshore infrastructure? Until recently, there were no direct measurements of turbidity currents due to the difficulties in deployment in remote and challenging subsea environments. New advances in technology have enabled the first measurements of velocity and concentration in deep-ocean turbidity currents. Techniques developed for, and lessons learned from, the monitoring of flows at a number of sites will be transferred to industry partners. This first aim is thus to help improve how industry assesses turbidity current hazards by using the first ever direct measurements. [2] How appropriate are existing models and how should they be revised based on new field-scale calibrations? As no comparable datasets exist, this new direct monitoring provides a unique opportunity to validate, test and refine numerical models of turbidity current. We will first assess how appropriate existing flows employed by industry are at recreating real flow behaviour. We will then run variants of a depth-resolved model developed by Dorrell. The aim is to provide a modelling approach that is acceptable in terms of computational cost, and that can recreate observations from direct monitoring. Specific guidance will be provided to the partners on how models should be developed to assess impact of turbidity currents on seafloor infrastructure. [3] What impact do real-world turbidity currents have on seafloor infrastructure? We will then quantify turbidity current impact on a range of seafloor infrastructure. This is novel because it will involve the application of new models based on the first deep-sea direct monitoring data. The analysis will transform industry understanding of impacts and mitigation strategies. Deliverables will include: (i) Report outlining industry best practice for turbidity current hazard assessment; (ii) New numerical modelling approach outlined in a workshop; (iii) Summary report detailing the modelled impacts of real-world turbidity currents on a range of seafloor infrastructure, and guidance for design, mitigation measures and future data acquisition strategies.

The efficiency of biostimulation (BS, fertilizer addition) and bioaugmentation (BA, inoculation of pre-stimulated indigenous hydrocarbon-degrading microorganisms plus fertilizer) compared to natural attenuation was tested during a 180-day experimental period. The effect of BA was evident after 60 days (degradation of hydrocarbons reached 80%). BS efficacy was revealed only after 120 days. Microorganisms and nutrients added at the top of the sand column were able to reach the buried oil layer and contributed to faster oil elimination, an important feature for effective bioremediation treatments. Therefore, autochthonous BA with suitable nutritive conditions results in faster oil-biodegradation, appears to be a cost-effective methodology for buried oil remediation and contributes to the recovery of oil-impacted areas.

The technique can offer significant reductions in the cost of archaeological survey and in the enhancement of survey results and is of particular value therefore to archaeologists working in contract-led context, which in many areas accounts for the majority of archaeological work (up to 80% in Scotland for example). Recent advances in multi-image photogrammetric software have resulted in highly automated workflows and significantly reduced the burden of technical knowledge required to produce survey results of an acceptable standard. Although the majority of multi-image photogrammetry surveys are still undertaken in an academic context the technique is increasingly being used by a far wider proportion of heritage professionals, many of whom are not first and foremost specialists in photogrammetry. The adoption of such highly automated workflows presents certain risks with regard to accuracy and reliability of results as noted by Remondino et al. (2012, 52). However the enormous potential of the technique for rapid and accurate survey and for reduced costs cannot be ignored and the challenge we face is to ensure that the highly automated workflows adopted by archaeologists in contract-led contexts are robust and reliable and underpinned by guidance and knowledge exchange. This paper is not intended as a comprehensive technical review of the technical aspects of the technique or of its development but instead focusses on highlighting its potential as a practical everyday tool for archaeological practitioners to apply in two of the main types of contract-led archaeological work, rapid survey and community engagement. A non-technical overview of the technique is given followed by case studies illustrating how the technique has been applied successfully in a non-academic contract-led and community engagement context. These surveys have been undertaken with very limited budgets for both survey and post-processing of data and typically with very limited time frames. In each case study, use of multi-image photogrammetry has allowed for better, faster and more cost-effective results than would otherwise have been possible. Case studies include a survey of an Iron Age fort, a rapid survey of exposed segments of an intertidal wreck, both commissioned for heritage management purposes and a community survey of a 17th century gravestone undertaken by children under the age of 16. Finally the obstacles to wider adoption in the contract-led sector are discussed and it is argued that a concerted approach is required to create and disseminate simple and reliable workflows.

A recent study detected a widespread decline in forest photosynthetic capacity over the Congo Basin and attributed this large-scale decline, at least partially, to this drying trend. Persistent drought in the region could alter the Congolese forest composition and structure in a manner that might favor the spread of drought tolerant species and thus impact biodiversity, carbon storage, and the global water cycle. Understanding the nature and cause of this drought and assessing its impacts on the forests are of significant societal, environmental, and economic importance. Understanding of climatic variability in the Congo basin is greatly hindered by a lack of observations and resources due to political, economic and historical factors. Under this project, a combination of observational and modeling studies will be undertaken to investigate the nature and cause of the Congo rainfall variability in the 20th century. The role of global sea surface temperatures will be examined.

The organic matter input, depositional environment conditions and petroleum generation potential from the Saar Formation shales were investigated using geochemical and organic petrological methods.The shales of the Saar Formation contain total organic carbon of 0.5-3.5 wt percent. The geochemical analysis of the organic matter indicated that these shales have fair to very good hydrocarbon source potential. The kerogen of the organic matter is dominated by Type II/III and Type III, referring to both oil- and gas-prone source rocks. The biomarker and bulk carbon isotope analyses of the organic matter suggested that the kerogens were constituted from a combination of marine and high land plant organic matter, and were preserved under suboxic depositional conditions.The geochemical and petrographic analyses of the shales (e.g., vitrinite reflectance (VRo), pyrolysis Tmax and biomarker maturity ratios) lead to the conclusion that the shales are generally immature to very early mature, particularly in shallower locations where the thermal alteration level of the organic matter is not strong enough to generate petroleum. Therefore, this work suggests that the mature source shale intervals of the Saar Formation existed in the deeper parts of the basin could reach a good maturity level that can produce potential hydrocarbons.

A recent study detected a widespread decline in forest photosynthetic capacity over the Congo Basin and attributed this large-scale decline, at least partially, to this drying trend. Persistent drought in the region could alter the Congolese forest composition and structure in a manner that might favor the spread of drought tolerant species and thus impact biodiversity, carbon storage, and the global water cycle. Understanding the nature and cause of this drought and assessing its impacts on the forests are of significant societal, environmental, and economic importance. Understanding of climatic variability in the Congo basin is greatly hindered by a lack of observations and resources due to political, economic and historical factors. Under this project, a combination of observational and modeling studies will be undertaken to investigate the nature and cause of the Congo rainfall variability in the 20th century. The role of global sea surface temperatures will be examined. For the observational component, observations and reanalysis data will be utilized to identify major patterns and drivers of the variability.

As new technologies emerge to remove oil from such discharges, the question remains as to the effect that the water soluble fraction of contaminants present in PW may have on the biota surrounding the areas of discharge. We investigated the effects of 8 weeks of intermittent exposure to environmentally relevant concentrations (100 or 1000 mg/L) of the aqueous fraction of PW (AFPW) on growth parameters, food consumption, respiratory burst activity of head kidney leukocytes (RB), activity of antioxidant enzymes and mRNA expression of immune- and detoxification-related genes of Atlantic cod. No significant effects of AFPW were seen on growth parameters, food consumption and/or RB. Furthermore, the activity of antioxidant enzymes and the expression of CYP1A, GST and UGT were not impacted by AFPW treatment. The mRNA expression of some immune related genes was affected in a similar manner as what has been described in Atlantic cod exposed to full PW suggesting that short chain soluble compounds present in PW might be responsible for its immunomodulatory effect. Traditionally used biomarkers of toxicant exposure such as phase I (CYP1A) and phase II (GST, UGT) genes do not seem to be reliable indicators of exposure to AFPW. This study confirms the fact that some immune related genes are affected by soluble components of PW and that further investigation on potential increased disease susceptibility is warranted.

As they are vulnerable to changes in temperature and precipitation, a rapidly changing environment endangers peatlands and their carbon storage potential. Understanding the mechanisms of peatland carbon accumulation from studying past developments may, therefore, help to assess the future role of tropical peatlands. Using a multi-proxy palaeoecological approach, a peat core taken from the Sungai Buluh peatland in Central Sumatra has been analyzed for its pollen and spore, macro charcoal and biogeochemical composition. The result suggests that peat and C accumulation rates were driven mainly by sea level change, river water level, climatic variability and anthropogenic activities. It is also suggested that peat C accumulation in Sungai Buluh is correlated to the abundance of Freycinetia, Myrtaceae, Calophyllum, Stemonuraceae, Fiats and Euphorbiaceae. Sungai Buluh has reasonable potential for being a future global tropical peat C sinks. However, considering the impact of rapid global climate change in addition to land-use change following rapid economic growth in Indonesia, such potential may be lost. Taking advantage of available palaeoecological records and advances made in Quaternary studies, some considerations for management practice such as identification of priority taxa and conservation sites are suggested.

In this paper, we first define a sea region of target detection and formulate a clustered topology of MSR-WSN. Second, we employ the sensor nodes of MSR-WSN to track the collective radio signal emitted by the mobile target. Each node firstly transmits the preprocessed perceived data to the cluster head node. Next, the data fusion center (DFC) collects a local decision of cluster head node through a binary hypothesis test and works out an accurate global decision. This paper emphasizes at designing both local and global data fusion rules based on the likelihood of ratio test statistics using a Neyman-Pearson lemma and Bayesian approach. One major stumbling block in the ocean lies in a complex and changing communication environment. There is a need for the DFC to develop a fusion rule of carrying out a dependable target detection to screen out the side effect of wave shadow. To address the concern, we propose a novel mobile target detection algorithm (NMTDA) based on information theory. The main idea is to dynamically calculate an adaptive decision threshold using both Kullback-Leibler divergence (KLD) and a global optimal decision statistics to enforce the accuracy of target detection. In addition, KLD is adopted to quantify the strength of wave shadow effect and tune Correct Detection/Flase Alarm probabilities of target detection. To conserve the overall MSR-WSN energy, DFC selects clusters with the maximum predictive information gain for MSR before next round search. Extensive simulation results demonstrate that our proposed mobile target detection algorithm works well in maritime search and rescue scenario.",,,,,,,,,14,4,0,0,1,0,17,,,0140-3664,1873-703X,,,,,,,,,,"Shanghai Maritime Univ, Merchant Marine Coll, Shanghai, Peoples R ChinaUniv Cent Florida, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, Orlando, FL 32816 USAUniv Calif Davis, Dept Comp Sci, Davis, CA 95616 USAHainan Normal Univ, Network & Data Ctr, Haikou, Hainan, Peoples R China",,,,2019-03-28,WOS:000461404100005,,

Understanding and managing the effects of this disruption on atmospheric composition and global climate are likely to be amongst the most pressing issues of the 21st century. However, the present-day carbon cycle is still poorly understood. One remarkable feature is that an increasing amount of atmospheric carbon dioxide appears to be being absorbed by terrestrial vegetation.I review the recent evidence for the magnitude and spatial distribution of this 'terrestrial carbon sink', drawing on current research on the global atmospheric distribution and transport of carbon dioxide, oxygen and their isotopes; direct measurement Of CO2 fluxes above various biomes; and inventories of forest biomass and composition. I review the likely causes of these carbon sinks and sources and their implications for the ecology and stability of these biomes.Finally, I examine prospects and key issues over coming decades. Within a few years, satellite measurements of atmospheric CO2 and forest biomass, coupled with 'real-time' biosphere-atmosphere models, will revolutionize our understanding of the terrestrial carbon cycle. Controlling deforestation and managing forests has the potential to play a significant but limited part in reaching the goal of stabilizing atmospheric CO2 concentrations.

This paper aims to present the recent research works regarding NETs, focusing the research findings achieved by academic groups and projects. Besides several advantages, NETs present high operational cost and its scale-up should be tested to know the real effect on climate change mitigation.

Traditionally, topsides are lifted onto the substructure (e.g. jacket) using heavy lift crane vessels. However, the 'lift' method of installation is constrained by the availability of a limited number of heavy lift vessels in the region, with high day rates. As an alternative to modular installation with light crane vessels, float-over installation enables installation of a single pre-commissioned integrated deck, minimizing offshore hook-up time and cost. Further, float-over method is particularly suited to shallow water depth locations, remote locations (with no access to crane vessels). In a float-over installation, the deck is transported on a cargo barge to the pre-installed substructure location. The barge is guided into the jacket slot and positioned so that the stabbing cone on each leg is aligned with the corresponding jacket leg. The barge is then ballasted down (aided by the falling tide) so that the topside load is transferred from the barge to the jacket. Once the load is transferred and sufficient clearance is achieved between the deck structure and barge support structure, the barge is withdrawn from the slot. The transfer of load is the crucial step of a float-over installation and should occur in a controlled manner under the dynamic influence of environmental forces. This smooth load transfer is achieved using LMU's. LMU's are customized leg and deck mating units, used to dampen the impact loads generated during the mating process. They consist of steel structures with elastomer elements and are designed to perform three primary functions, absorb shocks, limit hammering onto the structures and provide defined stiffness between deck and sub-structure. The objective of this paper is to outline the design philosophy of a LMU and address the behavior of the LMU under the combination of vertical and horizontal loads during the mating process. The paper also recommends guidelines on the selection of elastomer stiffness based on load-displacement relationship. The LMU is analysed in ABAQUS, a commercially available finite element (FE) analysis package considering a non-linear time-domain analysis. The results from the FE analysis are compared with the qualification tests for the elastomer and LMU assembly performed on-site to establish correlation.",,,,,"32nd ASME International Conference on Ocean, Offshore and Arctic Engineering32nd ASME International Conference on Ocean, Offshore and Arctic Engineering","JUN 09-14, 2013JUN 09-14, 2013","ASME, Ocean Offshore & Arctic Engn DivASME, Ocean Offshore & Arctic Engn Div","Nantes, FRANCENantes, FRANCE",2,0,0,0,0,0,2,,,,,978-0-7918-5531-7,,,,,,,,,"McDermott Middle East Inc, Dubai, U Arab Emirates",McDermott Middle East Inc,,,2013-01-01,WOS:000360417600037,,

Outcrop mapping indicates the presence of m-scale offset faults (i.e. below the resolution of the existing seismic data) and igneous intrusions, both of which may act as impermeable structural discontinuities. Igneous intrusions are also imaged using regional geophysical data sets (2D seismic, magnetic). However, their orientation and dimension are poorly constrained by the present data set.

Theme parks are visited by thousands of people worldwide and the rides are becoming more adventurous by demand. This places a greater strain on the material being used. Fracture mechanics analysis is being carried out to determine the critical defect size that can be allowed to exist. From a customer satisfaction point of view, the rides must be available when the theme park is open, which in some cases is all year. This means inspection techniques have to be used which are non-invasive but which can reliably detect even the smaller defects required to be detected. Bridges are even greater people-carriers, rail and road, and are often coated and have difficult access. Interest has been recently aroused in the structural integrity of high-rise buildings constructed with low-toughness weld metal. The majority of buildings constructed in the West Coast of America have used this material and several, especially in the California area, have been subject to seismic shocks. Tests carried out have shown that these shocks would be greater than those applied during the toughness tests which produced low values. This has led to the belief that some of these buildings will have defects present in their welded joints. The problem that now exists is one of inspection and determining if defects of a significant nature are present. The Alternating Current Field Measurement technique has been used successfully to inspect through coatings and, with rope access techniques, can be applied to these public safety applications.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,,0,0,0,,,1354-2575,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1997-12-01,WOS:A1997YJ85500014,,

Metabolic processes are a function of temperature, such that warming sea temperatures should increase microbial respiration, potentially reducing POC export. To investigate this in the Southern Ocean, we measured microbial oxygen consumption of large particles over a 10 degrees C temperature range (summer maximum +8 degrees C) to then estimate the decrease in export by 2100. Our results showed that POC-normalised respiration increased with warming. We estimate that POC export (scaled to primary production) could decrease by 17 +/- 7 % (SE) by 2100, using projected regional warming (+1.9 degrees C) from the IPCC RCP 8.5 ('business-as-usual' scenario) for our subAntarctic site. Increased microbial respiration is one of many processes that will be altered by future climate change, which could all modify carbon storage in the future. Our estimate of the potential decline in carbon sequestration is within previous estimates from lab and field experiments, but higher than simple mechanistic models. To explore our results further, we used the metabolic theory of ecology (MTE) to determine the activation energy of microbial respiration, which was 0.9 eV. This is higher than classical MTE (0.6-0.7 eV), suggesting that sub-Antarctic microbes are particularly sensitive to temperature change. Such regional characteristics in the response of organisms to increased temperatures should be accounted for in large-scale or global model analyses to ensure that the results do not underestimate microbial responses to warming.",,,,,,,,,14,0,0,0,9,0,16,,,0948-3055,1616-1564,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Tasmania, Inst Marine & Antarctic Studies, 20 Castray Esplanade, Battery Point, Tas 7004, AustraliaUniv Tasmania, Antarctic Climate & Ecosyst CRC, 20 Castray Esplanade, Battery Point, Tas 7004, Australia",,,,2019-01-10,WOS:000454321300001,,

In this paper, we measured CO2 and the brine interfacial tension using the pendant-drop method at a temperature of 285-300 K and pressure of 3-9 MPa. The brine was composed of Na+, K+, Ca2+, and Mg2+ cations with different molalities. The experimental results indicate that interfacial tension increased with temperature and salinity but decreased with pressure until it reached a plateau. At the same temperature and pressure, the plateau value increased with increasing brine salinity for all types of brines used in this work. Moreover, the plateau exists whenever the CO2 is liquid. The interfacial tension between CO2 and brine with bivalent cations is larger than that between CO2 and monovalent brines. Finally, we established an empirical equation based on the relationship between interfacial tension and temperature, pressure, and salt molality grounded on experimental data, which allows the evaluation of CO2-brine interfacial tension values with a mean deviation of +/- 4 mN.m(-1).

Among the different metals contained in the fuel spill, V and Ni are particularly of interest since they appear at relatively high concentration in the original fuel. Biomonitoring of V and Ni using wild mussels (Mytilus edulis) collected along the Galician Coast (NW Iberian Peninsula) has been performed. Ultrasound-assisted extraction of V and Ni from dried mussel tissues using probe sonication allowed a fast solid-liquid extraction thus facilitating sample preparation from large sample batches used for biomonitoring. V and Ni were determined in shellfish caught in the Galician littoral and tar balls from the Prestige spill by electrothermal-atomic absorption spectrometry and inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectrometry, respectively. A Plackett-Burman saturated design was applied for screening optimization of variables influencing the ultrasound-assisted extraction of V and Ni from shellfish. Efficient extraction of both metals was obtained from slurries prepared in 2 mL capacity sample vials (10 mg sample with a particle size less than 100 mu m) using a 3% (v/v) HNO3 diluent and subjected to probe sonication (3 min; 30% vibrational amplitude of the probe). The method was successfully validated by means of three certified reference materials: NRCC-TORT-2 Lobster hepatopancreas, NIST-SRM 1566b Oyster tissue and NIST-SRM 2977 Mussel tissue. The detection limit (LOD) of V and Ni in the marine biological tissues, calculated according to the 3 sigma criterion, were 0.24 mu g g(-1) and 0.15 mu g g(-1) for V and Ni, respectively. V and Ni concentrations in M. edulis were in the range 1.7-4.8 and 0.8-2.8 mu g g(-1), respectively. Whilst no significant variations in Ni contents were observed in regard to reference values, an important increase in V concentration is observed at some sampling points, thereby indicating bioaccumulation.

A comprehensive gas analysis programme was installed as an integrated part of field development in order to monitor gas composition, distribution and origin in the reservoirs and overburden pre- production start-up. Isotube OUT and isotube IN gas samples were collected. The isotube IN data show that some gas is recycled, including alkenes representing contamination from the degradation of mud additives; but concentrations are minor, and do not seem to affect the isotope values derived from the C-2 and C-3 isotube OUT gases significantly. C-13-enriched methane derived from drill-bit metamorphism is recorded in the isotube IN gas, but likewise in low concentrations. Gas data were also acquired from a Continuous Isotope Logging Tool (CILT) which measures real-time gas concentrations and isotope values of C-1-C-3 each foot through the entire drilled section. The CILT thus provides a continuous trend of methane isotope values versus depth, and this trend is useful in identifying changes in gas composition. However, concerns related to CILT include: (i) C-1-C-3 stable carbon isotope detection limits for isotube OUT gas analyses are considerable lower than for CILT; due to the lower isotube gas concentrations required for measurement of C-3 isotopes, isotubes are able to map a shallower vertical thermogenic gas migration front in the overburden. (ii) Discrepancies between isotube OUT and CILT isotope values may be significant and cannot be assigned to analytical uncertainty; by contrast, test gas and isotube OUT isotope values are comparable. Hence, CILT isotope values from specific depths cannot stand in isolation but must be complemented by isotube OUT isotope measurements. Gas in the Pentland reservoir is the most coaly in composition due to self-sourcing from the Pentland coals. The coals are the primary source rock for the gas encountered in the entire reservoir interval at Culzean, but the underlying Joanne sandstones contain contributions from highly mature marine shales in the Kimmeridge Clay Formation and/or Heather Formation. The Lower Cretaceous seal on top of the Pentland reservoir is relatively tight but some minor migration/leakage of thermogenic gas into the overburden is recorded by the detection of C-3 isotopes. Thermogenic gas also occurs in high porosity intervals in the Upper Cretaceous succession but this gas is interpreted to have migrated laterally in porous carrier beds and did not enter these intervals at the well locations.",,,,,,,,,13,0,0,0,0,0,15,,,0141-6421,1747-5457,,,,,,,,,,"Total Upstream Danmark AS, Explorat, GTS CPH, Copenhagen, DenmarkCulzean Field Dev Project, Total E&P UK Ltd, Aberdeen, Scotland",Total Upstream Danmark AS,,,2019-10-04,WOS:000486176000005,,

However, for MPD operations the instrumentation is typically more extensive compared to conventional drilling. Despite this, any influx of formation fluids (commonly known as a kick) during MPD operations is typically handled by conventional well control methods, at least if the kick is estimated to be larger than a threshold value. Conventional well control procedures rely on manual control of the blow out preventer, pumps, and choke valves and do not capitalize on the benefits from the instrumentation level associated with MPD.This paper investigates two alternative well control procedures specially adapted to backpressure MPD: the dynamic shut-in (DSI) procedure and the automatic kick control (AKC) procedure. Both methods capitalize on improvements in Pressure While Drilling (PWD) technology. A commercially available PWD tool buffers high-resolution pressure measurements, which can be used in an automated well control procedure. By using backpressure MPD, the choke valve opening is tuned automatically using a feedback-feedforward control method.The two procedures are evaluated using a high fidelity well flow model and cases from a North Sea drilling operation are simulated. The results show that using AKC procedure reduces the time needed to establish control of the well compared to DSI procedure.

Simply, the main aim of winterisation is to provide the crew and equipment units with a range of normal environmental and working conditions through, for instance, insulating equipment units, installing heat tracers, enclosing working areas, providing the crew with adequate clothing, etc.There are, however, some concerns about the efficiency of such winterisation measures and potential changes in operation risk level, of which the changes in plant downtime, production loss, and plant maintainability are the focus of present study. The issue of complex effects of winterisation measures on maintainability analysis of O&G plants operating in the Arctic offshore has gained little attention in the literature. In this study, different aspects of winterisation from the viewpoint of equipment maintainability are discussed. Further, a mathematical framework for maintainability analysis of equipment units subjected to winterisation measures is proposed. The impact of winterisation-related downtimes on plant downtime is analysed as well by employing a Monte Carlo system simulation technique.

Its seismic risks have caused considerable concerns. This paper studies paleoearthquakes along this fault by analyzing and correlating bore-hole cores obtained from triple-tube coring, incorporating experience acquired from trenching. As a result, a model for identifying earthquake-derived colluvium by sediment-core analysis is proposed. Triple-tube coring technique is useful to collect continuous undisturbed soil core near the Nankou-Sunhe Fault. By identifying fault-scarp colluviums, determining cumulative displacement, and analysing stratum thickening on the hanging wall, we are able to establish a preliminary paleoearthquake sequence consisting of 13 surface-rupturing events since 60 ka. The seismic history can be divided into three periods based on different recurrence intervals. Between 60 and 40 ka, three earthquakes occurred with recurrence interval of similar to 10 ka. From 40 to 25 ka, there were six earthquakes with the recurrence interval of about 2.5 ka. In the last 25 ka, four earthquakes have taken place with the recurrence interval varying considerably. The recurrence interval between the last three events is similar to 5 ka. Smaller recurrence intervals correspond to stages of faster fault slip. The coseismic displacement of a single event is 0.8 to 2.2 m, average 1.4 m, largely equivalent to moment magnitudes 6.7-7.1. This study demonstrates the feasibility of bore-hole drilling in investigating paleoearthquakes along normal faults.

Lab tests were conducted to determine the biodegradation rate, rheological properties, thickening time, compressive strength and dispersing property of GAFS in Class-G cement slurry. It is found that GAFS exhibits no retarding by-effect on oil well cement and can be considered biodegradable based on the biodegradation test results. The measured adsorption capacity and zeta potential of GAFS in Class-G well cement slurry show that: GAFS can be adsorbed greatly onto the surface of cement particles, resulting in strong electrostatic repulsion between cement particles and consequently generating an excellent dispersion performance.

UWASNs have numerous applications in areas such as fisheries, resource exploration, mine reconnaissance, oil and gas inspection, marine exploration and military surveillance. However, these applications are limited by the capacity of networks to detect, discover, transmit, and forward big data. In particular, transmitting and receiving large volumes of data requires great lengths of time and substantial power, and thus fails to meet the real-time constraints. This problem has motivated us to focus on developing an underwater computer-embedded system capable of efficient big-data management. Thus, we have developed methods to discover and extract valuable information beneath the ocean using data-mining approaches. Previously, we introduced real-time underwater system architectures (RTUSAs) that use a single computer. In this study, we extend our results and propose a new RTUSA for large-scale networks. This novel RTUSA uses multi-computers and aims to enhance the reliability of our proposed system. Determining the optimal location of computers with respect to their membership of acoustic sensor nodes, so as to minimize delay time, power consumption, and balance loads, are NP-hard problems. Therefore, we propose a heuristic approach that enables optimization of computer locations and their memberships of acoustic sensor nodes.

The failure of well integrity may cause undesirable events or even devastating consequences such as safety hazards or loss of containment. In this paper, a novel calculation model of wellbore integrity comprehensive risk has been presented. Firstly, the risk hazard associated with well barrier failure modes are identified based on the relevant literature. The risk factors of well integrity in production phase are investigated in detail. The risk matrix based on Borda number analytical method and Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) is then presented to assess the risks of well integrity in production safety. Finally, the case of XX high sour gas well is empirically investigated to validate the model. The results indicate that 27 risk factors are identified for XX gas well in production. In addition, it is found that the XX gas well is prone to suffer damage in presence of H2S and CO2, furthermore, the Borda number analytical results also show that the most important factor affecting the well integrity is effect of string corrosion, followed by the corrosion of string sealing accessories and the corrosion environment of material applicability. Therefore, the appropriate measures should be taken to reduce the corrosion of string and sealing accessories, thus prolonging the service life of the equipment. The case of XX high sour gas field verifies the feasibility and applicability of the risk matrix method in wellbore integrity risk assessment. The innovative assessment method provides methodological reference and guidance for the application of the limited resources, in addition, it also has practical information for well integrity engineers to improve the performance of safety management, thus ensuring well safety during production.",,,,,,,,,12,1,0,0,0,0,12,,,0920-4105,1873-4715,,,,,,,,,,"Southwest Petr Univ, State Key Lab Oil & Gas Reservoir Geol & Exploita, Chengdu 610500, Sichuan, Peoples R ChinaMIT, Cambridge, MA 02139 USASinopec Res Inst Petr Engn, Dazhou 636156, Peoples R ChinaPetroChina Southwest Oil & Gas Field Co, Luzhou 646000, Peoples R ChinaKing Fahd Petr & Mineral, Dhahran, Saudi Arabia",,,,2018-09-18,WOS:000443829400074,,

However, information about the coupling effect of crude oil contamination and salinization on soil biological characteristics is lacking. Therefore, the objective of this study was to examine soil bacterial community changes in response to different gradients of salinity and total petroleum hydrocarbon (TPH) concentration. Fifteen soil samples collected from the Yellow River Delta region of China with different gradients of salinity and TPH concentration were used for analyzing soil physicochemical properties, microbial biomass and denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) profiles. The results showed that salinity negatively affected soil microbial biomass carbon (MBC) and microbial biomass nitrogen (MBN), but little affected bacterial Shannon and evenness indices. TPH concentration was correlated negatively with soil MBC, positively with MBN and Shannon index, but had no effect on evenness index. Canonical correspondence analysis showed that salinity and TPH concentration were the main factors causing the shift of soil bacterial community structure. Soil salinity had a suppress effect on most bacterial populations without changing their dominance, while soil TPH influenced the bacterial diversity selectively. By extraction of main bacterial clusters from the dendrogram tree of DGGE profiles, the most active bacterial species involved in the shift of bacterial community structure were identified under the single or dual stresses of salinization and oil contamination. Actinobacteria, gamma-Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, Deinococcus-Thermus and some unclassified bacteria were the dominant bacteria participating in crude oil degradation in dual stresses of salinization and oil contamination. Our results provide new insight and useful information in the screening of cultivable bacteria for bioremediation of crude oil contaminated saline. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

HCl is electrochemically removed from the ocean and neutralized through reaction with silicate rocks. The increase in ocean alkalinity resulting from the removal of HCl causes atmospheric CO2 to dissolve into the ocean where it will be stored primarily as HCO3- without further acidifying the ocean. On timescales of hundreds of years or longer, some of the additional alkalinity will likely lead to precipitation or enhanced preservation of CaCO3, resulting in the permanent storage of the associated carbon, and the return of an equal amount of carbon to the atmosphere. Whereas the natural silicate weathering process is effected primarily by carbonic acid, the engineered process accelerates the weathering kinetics to industrial rates by replacing this weak acid with HCl. In the thermodynamic limit-and with the appropriate silicate rocks-the overall reaction is spontaneous. A range of efficiency scenarios indicates that the process should require 100-400 kJ of work per mol of CO2 captured and stored for relevant timescales. The process can be powered from stranded energy sources too remote to be useful for the direct needs of population centers. It may also be useful on a regional scale for protection of coral reefs from further ocean acidification. Application of this technology may involve neutralizing the alkaline solution that is coproduced with HCl with CO2 from a point source or from the atmosphere prior to being returned to the ocean.",,,,,,,,,83,3,0,0,16,0,95,,,0013-936X,1520-5851,,,,,,,,,,"Harvard Univ, Dept Earth & Planetary Sci, Cambridge, MA 02138 USAPenn State Univ, Dept Geosci, University Pk, PA 16802 USAHarvard Univ, Sch Engn & Appl Sci, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",,,,2007-12-15,WOS:000251582800043,18200880,

This study presents the carbon and water footprint of packed mango produced in Vale do SAo Francisco, the main irrigated valley in Brazil. It provides an approach to identify the critical processes and opportunities for improvements in the conventional crop system that may support producers in the task of developing future site-specific assessments.Methods This assessment followed ISO 14046 and ISO 14067 for water and carbon footprints, respectively, as well as specific requirements of product category rule (PCR) 013 for fruits and nuts and Publicly Available Specification (PAS) 2051-1 for horticulture products. Primary data was collected for nursery (seedling), land use change, crop production, and packaging, considering five exported mango varieties: Palmer, Keitt, Kent, Haden, and Tommy Atkins. The carbon footprint assessment was based on the impact category climate change, while water footprint encompassed the following categories: water scarcity, marine and freshwater eutrophication, human toxicity (carcinogenic and non-carcinogenic), and freshwater ecotoxicity. The footprint analysis was performed for 1kg of packed mango.Results and discussion The three main processes responsible for both footprints were related to crop production: fertilizer and electricity production as well as mango cropping. Moving from Caatinga vegetation to mango orchards increased carbon storage but was not enough to offset the impact on climate change. For water footprint, it was observed that the total volume of applied irrigation water was already below technical requirements and cannot be reduced, the same occurring for nitrogen fertilization. Scenario analysis showed that the use of alternative electricity sources and the reuse of wastewater brought no major improvement in results. Furthermore, the choice of local or country level characterization factors for water scarcity changed results significantly. Discussions are made regarding (i) the relevance of mango footprints when compared to other irrigated fruits, (ii) possibilities for improving mango footprint performance, (iii) the need for updating product category rules for fruits, and (iv) the quality of provided inventories and results.Conclusions The comparison of mango footprints with previous studies of irrigated fruits showed that mango performance is similar or better than many irrigated fruits, cultivated all over the world. Moreover, footprints may be further reduced if mango orchards are established in previously deforested land or areas occupied with annual crops and if improvements are made in the irrigation and fertilization practices at each mango production stage.",,,,,,,,,16,0,0,0,8,2,18,,,0948-3349,1614-7502,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Fed Ceara, BR-60020181 Fortaleza, Ceara, BrazilUniv Estadual Ceara, BR-60741000 Fortaleza, Ceara, BrazilEmbrapa Agroind Trop, BR-60511110 Fortaleza, Ceara, BrazilEmbrapa Semiarido, BR-56302970 Petrolina, PE, BrazilEmbrapa Meio Ambiente, BR-13918110 Jaguariuna, SP, Brazil",,,,2019-04-18,WOS:000463670600012,,

The available geological data at the Mallik site of Canada indicates the vertical heterogeneities of hydrate reservoir petrophysical properties. According to the logging data and sample analysis results at the Mallik 2L-38 well, a 2D model of geologically descriptive hydrate-bearing sediments was established to investigate the multiphase flow behaviors in hydrate reservoir induced by gas recovery and the effects of perforation interval on gas production performance. Firstly, the constructed model with vertical heterogeneous structures of permeability, porosity, and hydrate saturation was validated by matching the measured data in the Mallik 2007 test. The excessive residual methane in the hydrate reservoir observed in simulated results indicates insufficient gas production efficiency. For more effective methane recovery from a hydrate reservoir, the effect of perforation interval on long-term gas production performance was investigated based on the validated reservoir model. The simulation results suggest that both the location and length of the perforation interval have significant impact on hydrate dissociation behavior, while the gas production performance is mainly affected by the length of the perforation interval. To be specific, an excellent gas release performance is found in situations where the perforation interval is set at the interface between a hydrate reservoir and an underlying water-saturated zone. By increasing the perforation interval lengths of 5 m, 8 m, and 10 m, the gas release volumes from hydrate dissociation and gas production volumes from production wells are increased by 34%, 52%, and 57% and 37%, 58%, and 62%, respectively.",,,,,,,,,5,1,0,0,0,0,6,,,1468-8115,1468-8123,,,,,,,,,,"Jilin Univ, Key Lab Groundwater Resources & Environm, Minist Educ, Changchun 130021, Peoples R China",,,,2020-07-21,WOS:000546075000001,,

Recent effort has focused on using available data to generate maps of tree heights at a global scale in the service of a better understanding of above ground biomass distribution and its effects on global carbon storage. However, global data sets, while validated at a global scale, often display local and regional variations in accuracy which must be quantified before applying those data sets to smaller scale studies.

For this reason, floating liquefied natural gas system has attracted the attention of the industries, governments and academia. One of the major issues to be overcome in realisation of floating liquefied natural gas is the motion prediction of close-proximity floating bodies including the gap resonance between the two bodies. In this article, three steps were carried out in order to understand the ship motions and the gap resonance and their effects to the side-by-side offloading operations. First, the two-dimensional gap resonance between the two bodies was investigated using a viscous flow numerical method. Second, the three-dimensional gap resonance and the floating body motions were studied using a potential flow method and validated by the experimental model test.

Principal components analysis (PCA) suggested differences in protein expression among stations and sampling years. Several proteins were putatively identified by mass spectrometry and immunolocalization. PCI separated the NW stations in 2004 from the rest of the stations and sampling years mainly due to up-regulation of peroxisomal P-oxidation proteins and PMP70. PC3 separated the NE stations, based on up-regulation of the antioxidant enzyme catalase in 2004 compared to 2005. PC4 separated the stations in the NE and the NW.

The research, testing and development of CDR technologies needed to support these expectations pose significant challenges for international and domestic climate change law. Prominent examples of CDR proposals include bioenergy production with carbon capture and storage (BECCS) and carbon sequestration by ocean fertilisation.

This limitation is implicit in generic QRAs that do not appropriately reflect the specificities of the rig and its environment, without considering systems arrangements, Risk Influencing Factors (RIF) or current operational conditions.The proposed method is divided into three pillars: (i) a guideline for modeling the blowout probability considering specific conditions or well, rig, safety barriers and Risk Influencing Factors (RIF) objectives; (ii) a proposed axiom combined with a scoring system to quantify the RIF into the QRA; and (iii) a risk based plan framework, to allow risk update and sequential learning during the operational phase.The APPM is based on a Bayesian Network (BN) mathematical framework. It allows the pre-defined axiom to be entered into a conditional probability table (CPT). This approach, combined with the assessment of the company's safety management system, allows the incorporation of RIF into the QRA.The developed APPM is applied to a theoretical micro-scale calculation. The result demonstrates its suitability for addressing common aspects inherent to the blowout phenomenon, including uncertainty, dependability between variables (common cause factors and redundant failures), and dynamism due to planned or unplanned operational changes in systems, drilling parameters and current conditions of RIF.

Public engagement through both traditional and social media was arguably much higher than in prior spills. The DWH response organization undertook a wide variety of activities to manage risks and communicate with both the general public and those directly affected, such as commercial fishers. However, these did not fully address widespread concerns about ecological and human health risks associated with dispersant use. Consequentially the DWH spill heightened awareness of persistent risk communication problems around oil spill response, and especially dispersant use. Oil spill risk research and experience suggests that institutional and operational factors inhibit engaging communities and stakeholders during oil spill preparedness and response, and that such engagement is essential for effective risk management. In this article we review and assess current oil spill preparedness and response practices for community and stakeholder engagement, including related institutional and operational constraints. This assessment suggests five example risk management practices to improve and advance risk communications during oil spill preparedness and response activities.",,,,,,,,,18,0,0,0,8,3,22,,,1080-7039,1549-7860,,,,,,,,,,"SEA Consulting Grp, Cape Charles, VA 23310 USAUniv Washington, Sch Marine & Environm Affairs, Seattle, WA 98195 USAUniv Washington, Daniel J Evans Sch Publ Affairs, Seattle, WA 98195 USAUniv Washington, Seattle, WA 98195 USA",SEA Consulting Grp,,,2015-04-03,WOS:000344915500006,,

We present a detailed review that builds on earlier work by including the most recent literature, and is more extensive than previous comparative frameworks. Solar radiation management propsals are most effective but short-lived, whilst carbon dioxide removal measures gain effectiveness the longer they are pursued. Solar radiation management could restore the global radiative balance, but must be maintained to avoid abrupt warming, meanwhile ocean acidification and residual regional climate changes would still occur. Carbon dioxide removal involves less risk, and offers a way to return to a pre-industrial CO2 level and climate on a millennial timescale, but is potentially limited by the CO2 storage capacity of geological reservoirs. Geoengineering could complement mitigation, but it is not an alternative to it.

Personal samples were collected among 65 drill floor workers on four stationary and six moveable rigs in the Norwegian offshore sector. Air concentrations of drilling mud were determined based on measurements of the non-volatile mud components Ca and Fe. The median air concentration of mud was 140 mu g m(-3). Median air concentrations of oil mist (180 mu g m(-3)), oil vapour (14 mu g m(-3)) and organic carbon (46 mu g m(-3)) were also measured. All contaminants were detected in all work areas (drill floor, shaker area, mud pits, pump room, other areas). The highest air concentrations were measured in the shaker area, but the differences in air concentrations between working areas were moderate. Oil mist and oil vapour concentrations were statistically higher on moveable rigs than on stationary rigs, but after adjusting for differences in mud temperature the differences between rig types were no longer of statistical significance. Statistically significant positive associations were found between mud temperature and the concentrations of oil mist (Spearman's R = 0.46) and oil vapour (0.39), and between viscosity of base oil and oil mist concentrations. Use of pressure washers was associated with higher air concentrations of mud. A series of 18 parallel stationary samples showed a high and statistically significant association between concentrations of organic carbon and oil mist (r = 0.98).

In addition, we will continue our region-wide focus on hydric soils and hydric indicators to determine if there is a need for additional hydric soil indicators for vernal pool ecosystems. We will use our data to develop empirical and spatial quantitative models to predict and represent the landscape distribution of vernal pools, and how climatic change may affect these wetland ecosystems. A continuation of this project will provide a forum to advance our knowledge of these systems and the associated soils and provide an outlet for the dissemination of our knowledge across the region to stakeholders that are seeking answers to their use, management, and restoration questions.Working within the proposed regional framework will allow for testing of hypotheses across climatic gradients, across parent material types (coastal plain, residual, and glacial), and among different types and settings of vernal pools. Testing these hypotheses is not possible for a single investigator working within a single state and must be done at the regional level. Addressing these questions within a regional framework is also critical because the major agencies that use the soils information that pedologists collect, such as USDA-NRCS, USACOE, USEPA, all work in a region-wide context. In addition, working groups such as the New England Hydric Soil Technical Committee and Mid-Atlantic Hydric Soils Committee, who offer guidance to regional regulatory bodies like the New England Water Pollution Control Commission (http://www.neiwpcc.org/), need soils information that is not restricted by state boundaries.Recent focus of the USACOE and other federal agencies to develop regional supplements as amendments to the 1987 Wetlands Delineation Manual (Environmental Laboratory, 1987) provide additional incentive to work region-wide in applied research. Data gathered,relationships that are established, and interpretations that are made are therefore much more meaningful to the user if the science was tested within a region-wide context. These studies also take advantage of the range of experiences and skills of the pedologists across the region.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,1007650; 912500,,,,,,,,UNIVERSITY OF MASSACHUSETTS AMHERST,,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:12739218,,

The algorithm relies on using electrical current data at one end for identification of the fault zone without communication between relays. The concept is to use the fault generated transients to differentiate between internal and external faults. Shunt capacitors with predetermined values are installed at the boundary between each two HVDC line sections to assist, together with the busbar stray capacitance, in the classification of internal faults. The high frequency transients will reach the relaying point without any attenuation if the fault is internal; nevertheless, the high frequency transients will be highly attenuated if the fault is external due to the stray capacitance and the installed shunt capacitor at the connection busbar. Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) is used to analyze the fault current signals. MTHVDC system modeling and relay design are carried out in the MATLAB/SIMULINK environment. The results of the proposed algorithm were highly reliable regarding different types of faults with different fault resistances and at various locations. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Old growth can be viewed from ecological and social perspectives. For policy and management purposes old growth has been defined as a growth stage in forest development, incorporating ecological maturity and lack of evidence of past disturbance. Classification and assessment of old growth has largely been restricted to those areas covered by regional forest agreements (RFAs) between different states and the Federal Government. Old growth can be impacted by wildfire, timber harvesting, insect pests, diseases and other disturbances. Climate change will also present challenges for the future management of old-growth forests. There is increasing scientific understanding of the relationships between species, forest growth stage and old-growth forest attributes.

In this study, a method for detecting genotoxicity in environmental samples was developed using the bioluminescent whole-cell bioreporter Escherichia coli recit:luxCDABE. To further test its performance in a real world scenario, the E. coli bioreporter was applied in two cases: i) soil samples collected from chromium(VI) contaminated sites; ii) crude oil contaminated seawater collected after the Jiaozhou Bay oil spill which occurred in 2013. The chromium(VI) contaminated soils were pretreated by water extraction, and directly exposed to the bioreporter in two phases: aqueous soil extraction (water phase) and soil supernatant (solid phase). The results indicated that both extractable and soil particle fixed chromium(VI) were bioavailable to the bioreporter, and the solid-phase contact bioreporter assay provided a more precise evaluation of soil genotoxicity. For crude oil contaminated seawater, the response of the bioreporter clearly illustrated the spatial and time change in genotoxicity surrounding the spill site, suggesting that the crude oil degradation process decreased the genotoxic risk to ecosystem. In addition, the performance of the bioreporter was simulated by a modified cross-regulation gene expression model, which quantitatively described the DNA damage response of the E. coli bioreporter. Accordingly, the bioluminescent response of the bioreporter was calculated as the mitomycin C equivalent, enabling quantitative comparison of genotoxicities between different environmental samples. This bioreporter assay provides a rapid and sensitive screening tool for direct genotoxicity assessment of environmental samples.

Nearly 1% of people have amedical condition that can be traced back to a single gene. This is particularly true for patients withcardiovascular disease. Genetic testing is now commonly employed in clinical practice. As a result, it hasbecome clear that we have an incomplete understanding of how genetic mutations cause Mendelian disease.Some patients with deleterious mutations display very severe symptoms while others are almost entirelyunaffected. This is true even for childhood-onset disorders with severe cardiovascular symptoms, like MarfanSyndrome. Understanding the range of disease severity has important implications for diagnosis, prognosis,and management. In the past, cohort studies and case series have been used to gather this type of information,but these yield incomplete and biased views of disease heterogeneity. Therefore, new methods for studyingMendelian disease genetic and phenotypic diversity are urgently needed. Population-scale biobanks linked to electronic health records (EHRs) can provide a less biased view ofgenotype-to-phenotype relationships. Subjects are included in these datasets regardless of their medicalhistory. EHR data also provides detailed phenotypic information on each subject. Finally, these biobanks nowinclude hundreds of thousands of individuals, capturing rare genetic variation on an unprecedented scale. As aresult, we hypothesize that population-scale biobanks can provide new insight into the genotype-to-phenotyperelationships that underlie congenital cardiovascular syndromes (CCSs). This hypothesis will be tested in twospecific aims. In Aim 1, we will use biobanks to develop quantitative scores that reproducibly summarize CCS-related phenotypic severity. These traits have multiple applications. In Aim 2, we will use them to buildcomputational models that predict the phenotypic effects of CCS-related rare variants directly from sequencecontext. Once validated, these models should reduce diagnostic uncertainty in clinical practice. I am a clinical geneticist and physician-scientist devoted to improving the quality of healthcareprovided to Mendelian disease patients. Long term, I plan to develop an independent research program thatuses complex clinical and genetic datasets to improve our understanding of Mendelian disease risk, variability,and progression. My K38 research proposal is entirely consistent with these goals. In addition, it will providevaluable career development. New technical skills in EHR data analysis and statistical genetics will be acquired,as will academic skills like grant writing. During the award, I will be mentored by leaders in the fields ofbiomedical data science and human genetics, including Dr. Atul Butte and Dr. Neil Risch. Finally, the K38award will serve as springboard for future funding opportunities and research independence. Therefore, theK38 StARRTS award will serve as a critical milestone in my development as a physician scientist.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,10724185; 1K38HL164956-01A1; K38HL164956,,,,,,,,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",,,,2023-12-14,GRANTS:17332123,,

Because carbon dioxide is removed from the atmosphere and sequestered in forests and wood products, mitigation strategies to sustain and increase forest carbon sequestration are being developed. These strategies require full accounting of forest sector GHG budgets. Here, we describe a rigorous approach using over one million observations from forest inventory data and a regionally calibrated life-cycle assessment for calculating cradle-to-grave forest sector emissions and sequestration. We find that Western US forests are net sinks because there is a positive net balance of forest carbon uptake exceeding losses due to harvesting, wood product use, and combustion by wildfire. However, over 100 years of wood product usage is reducing the potential annual sink by an average of 21%, suggesting forest carbon storage can become more effective in climate mitigation through reduction in harvest, longer rotations, or more efficient wood product usage. Of the similar to 10 700 million metric tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalents removed from west coast forests since 1900, 81% of it has been returned to the atmosphere or deposited in landfills. Moreover, state and federal reporting have erroneously excluded some product-related emissions, resulting in 25%-55% underestimation of state total CO2 emissions. For states seeking to reach GHG reduction mandates by 2030, it is important that state CO2 budgets are effectively determined or claimed reductions will be insufficient to mitigate climate change.",,,,,,,,,51,1,0,0,29,0,56,,,1748-9326,,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Idaho, Dept Forest Rangeland & Fire Sci, 875 Perimeter Dr MS1133, Moscow, ID 83844 USAOregon State Univ, Dept Forest Ecosyst & Soc, 321 Richardson Hall, Corvallis, OR 97333 USATufts Univ, Ctr Int Environm & Resource Policy, Fletcher Sch, Medford, MA 02155 USATufts Univ, Global Dev & Environm Inst, Medford, MA 02155 USA",,,,2019-09-01,WOS:000482610600002,,

J,,,,,,,,,Bjornar Sandnes,,Frictional flow patterns shaped by viscous and capillary forces (FriicFlow),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Awarded Grant,Jun 30 2019,2019,"Flow and mixing of fluids and granular materials occur in a wide range of processes. In nature, methane venting from ocean sediments represents a significant source of greenhouse gas, and the emission rate is intimately linked with complex interactions between the sediment and the rising methane gas in the form of bubbles or channels. Another example is the migration of gas through volcanic magma - a mixture of solid crystals and liquid melt - where the specifics of the complex flow patterning of the gas transport is thought to influence volcanic eruption behaviour. In the engineering sector, handling of granular suspensions and deformable porous materials are key in a wide range of industries from oil and gas, to food processing and pharmaceuticals. Despite the abundance and importance of such processes, fundamental knowledge of the physics that control them is lacking in many areas. These systems are inherently difficult to predict and control because of the very complex interactions taking place between the granular materials, liquids and gases during flow.The main aim of the project is to uncover the physics of two unknown mechanisms, namely the role of fluid viscosity and grain-fluid interactions in controlling the flow behaviour of frictional fluids and deformable materials. Using both experiments and computer simulations, we will explore the full range of viscosity ratio; high viscosity fluids injected into low viscosity host fluids and vice versa, where the host fluid contains granular materials of a range of concentrations, shapes and sizes. Where the two fluids meet, the meniscus will push or pull on the grains depending on the wetting properties, e.g. whether the grains are hydrophilic (water-loving) or hydrophobic (water-hating). Through finely controlled experiments matched with theory and simulations we will reveal the effect of wetting on the flow behaviour. The new insight will be incorporated into models that will allow a much more accurate prediction of frictional flow behaviour, and ultimately to improving forecasting of natural events such as volcanic eruptions, and to optimize industrial processing of granular suspensions and deformable materials.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,EP/S034587/1,,,,,,,,Swansea University,,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:15409952,,

Oil mist and oil vapour concentrations have been measured in the drilling fluid processing areas for decades; however, little work has been carried out to investigate exposure determinants such as drilling fluid viscosity and temperature. A study was undertaken to investigate the effect of two different oil-based drilling fluid systems and their temperature on oil mist, oil vapour, and total volatile organic compounds (TVOC) levels in a simulated shale shaker room at a purpose-built test centre. Oil mist and oil vapour concentrations were sampled simultaneously using a sampling arrangement consisting of a Millipore closed cassette loaded with glass fibre and cellulose acetate filters attached to a backup charcoal tube. TVOCs were measured by a PhoCheck photo-ionization detector direct reading instrument. Concentrations of oil mist, oil vapour, and TVOC in the atmosphere surrounding the shale shaker were assessed during three separate test periods. Two oil-based drilling fluids, denoted 'System 2.0' and 'System 3.5', containing base oils with a viscosity of 2.0 and 3.3-3.7 mm(2) s(-1) at 40 degrees C, respectively, were used at temperatures ranging from 40 to 75 degrees C. In general, the System 2.0 yielded low oil mist levels, but high oil vapour concentrations, while the opposite was found for the System 3.5. Statistical significant differences between the drilling fluid systems were found for oil mist (P = 0.025),vapour (P < 0.001), and TVOC (P = 0.011). Increasing temperature increased the oil mist, oil vapour, and TVOC levels. Oil vapour levels at the test facility exceeded the Norwegian oil vapour occupational exposure limit (OEL) of 30 mg m(-3) when the drilling fluid temperature was >= 50 degrees C. The practice of testing compliance of oil vapour exposure from drilling fluids systems containing base oils with viscosity of <= 2.0 mm(2) s(-1) at 40 degrees C against the Norwegian oil vapour OEL is questioned since these base oils are very similar to white spirit. To reduce exposures, relevant technical control measures in this area are to cool the drilling fluid <50 degrees C before it enters the shale shaker units, enclose shale shakers and related equipment, in addition to careful consideration of which fluid system to use.",,,,,,,,,7,1,0,0,1,0,8,,,0003-4878,,,,,,,,,,,"Statoil ASA, NO-0243 Oslo, NorwayInst Occupat Med, Edinburgh EH14 4AP, Midlothian, Scotland",Inst Occupat Med,,,2011-06-03,WOS:000290819400001,21248050,

One thing which appears certain about Brexit is the shadow of uncertainty it casts on the future of business in the UK and its telling effects on the UK economy. It is believed that Brexit has negatively affected the level of investments in the UK, including investments in energy and crucially the upstream oil and gas, with the UK North Sea being starved of investments since 2014, leading already to increased energy bills. The UK is a net importer of natural gasa major source of its energy, with some dependence on supplies from interconnectors from Europe. At the same time, UK energy companies participate in the common energy market which enables them to undertake arbitrage trading under the common market rules. However, both of these benefits could be lost under a Brexit scenario where the UK and EU come to a no-deal or hard border arrangement. Meanwhile, domestic production of energy in the UK has declined for nearly two decades now and import bills for natural gas are growingthey were 14.2 pound billion in 2017; 11.7 pound billion in 2016 and 13.4 pound billion in 2015with Government projections indicating an upward trajectory for natural gas imports. It is however believed that the UK has great potential to exploit shale gas to her advantage in order to reduce her reliance on foreign energy which is: (1) less predictable in terms of supply and price affordability and (2) dependent on exchange ratesa primary means through which energy prices increased in 2016/17 post-Brexit referendum vote. The current study extends discussions on shale gas to cover a review of the potential of natural gas from shale formations to cushion UK households against further erratic gas prices due to Brexit and also assesses the potential effects Brexit may have had on the level of investments in shale gas, in order to suggest policy options for government consideration. Contrary to popular studies, we find evidence to suggest that shale gas has the potential to reduce energy prices for UK businesses and households at commercial extractions, under both hard and soft Brexit scenarios, but with more benefits under hard Brexit. Importantly, we find that from 2008 to 2017, average UK net export of natural gas was 5,191 GWh per year to the EU. We also find and argue that Brexit may have starved the nascent fracking industry of investments in a similar way it did to investments in conventional oil and gas and could have increased investor risk premium for shale gas development, the ultimate effect of which was a categorisation of fracking (company stock) as riskier asset for investors on the London Stock Exchange. We recommend that shale gas development be expedited to maximise its benefits to UK energy consumers post-Brexit or economic benefits from the resource could be diminished by rising operator costs due to delays and effects of the public's perceived negative opinion of the method of extraction.",,,,,,,,,4,0,0,0,0,0,5,,,1996-1073,,,,,,,,,,,"Coventry Univ, Sch Energy Construct & Environm, Coventry CV1 5FB, W Midlands, England",,,,2019-03-28,WOS:000460667700026,,

In this study, a novel low-cost bio-adsorbent was prepared from shrimp shell and acid-activated montmorillonite. The results of FT-IR spectroscopy, energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) analysis, and SEM-EDX technique indicated that the chitosan-activated montmorillonite (CTS-A-MMT) was prepared successfully. The synthesized CTS-A-MMT was applied to remove simultaneously five cationic and anionic metal species and crude oil from synthetic and real oilfield PW. The adsorption data indicated that crude oil and all studied metals (except As) were adsorbed to CTS-A-MMT in a monolayer model (best fitted by Langmuir model), while As adsorption fits well with Freundlich model. Kinetic models' evaluation demonstrated that the adsorption kinetics of metals on CTS-A-MMT are initially controlled by the chemical reaction (film diffusion) followed by intra-particle diffusion. Application of the prepared CTS-A-MMT in real oilfield PW indicated removal efficiency of 65 to 93% for metals and 87% for crude oil in simultaneous removal experiments. Presence of additional ions in PW decreased the removal of studied metals and crude oil considerably; however, the concentration of the investigated pollutants in treated PW is less than the ocean discharge criteria. It is concluded that the prepared CTS-A-MMT composite is a low-cost and effective adsorbent for treating wastewater contaminated with crude oil and heavy metals (i.e., PW).",,,,,,,,,18,0,0,0,6,0,18,,,0944-1344,1614-7499,,,,,,,,,,"Shiraz Univ, Dept Earth Sci, Coll Sci, Shiraz 71454, IranShiraz Univ, Sch Chem & Petr Engn, Mollasadra Ave, Shiraz 71345, Iran",,,,2018-12-28,WOS:000447220700059,30196464,

R,"Melara, Angelica",,,,,,,,,,Is Aquatic Bioenergy with Carbon Capture and Storage a Sustainable Negative Emission Technology?: Insights from a Spatially Explicit Environmental Life-Cycle Assessment,,,,,,,,LibraData - University of Virginia Dataverse,,,,,,,,,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.18130/V3-BF8H-P407,,,,,,,Data set,2020-10-25,2020,"It is anticipated that the achievement of the Paris Climate Agreement will require the widespread deployment of negative emission technologies (NETs). The most prominent NET is bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS), which is typically envisioned to use terrestrial crops as feedstock. A few recent studies have focused on aquatic BECCS (A-BECCS), which makes use of marine macroalgae feedstock, as a possible means of reducing water and land use. However, the high logistic complexity of the A-BECCS supply chain makes it likely that regional biophysical and socio-technical factors will strongly influence its overall favorability. Therefore, this study applies a life-cycle assessment (LCA) incorporating a geographic information system (GIS) framework to estimate the environmental impacts of A-BECCS over all stages of its life-cycle. Three candidate locations in the USA are evaluated based on seemingly good proximity to coastal regions and CO2 storage; namely, East Coast, West Coast, and the Gulf of Mexico. Model outputs include energy return on investment (EROI), and net global warming potential (GWP). Additional metrics are explored to elucidate A-BECCSs carbon sequestration and energy use efficiency, which are biogenic carbon efficiency and net energy required to store a GT of carbon. Monte Carlo simulation is used to characterize distributions of model outputs. Results reveal that only the Gulf of Mexico configuration has any likelihood of achieving both net energy production (probability of EROI > 1= 29%) and net CO2 sequestration (probability of GWP < 0= 6%), but the probability of achieving both together is very low (5%). The other locations exhibit net positive energy production (EROI > 1), but not net negative carbon sequestration (GWP > 0). These results call into question the feasibility of the modeled A-BECCS system as an energy-producing NET and offer insights into possible system reconfiguration. For example, anaerobic digestion offers very low EROI and creates multiple carbon-bearing waste streams, which strongly undercuts overall net CO2 sequestration. Finally, it is observed that enhanced oil recovery (EOR) strongly contributes to net-energy production (EROI > 1) in the modeled A-BECCS system, but also strongly undercuts net CO2 sequestration, which is arguably the main goal of any NET. To our knowledge, this is the first geographically explicit life cycle assessment of A-BECCS and a step toward understanding the logistic complexities with NETs.

It is located near shipping lanes, is possibly a highly variable acoustic environment, and is frequented by the endangered Southern Resident killer whale (SRKW). Resolving environmental impacts is the first step to receiving approval to deploy tidal turbines. Several monitoring technologies are being considered to determine the presence of SRKW near the turbines. Broadband noise level measurements are critical for determining design and operational specifications of these technologies. Acoustic environment data at the proposed site were acquired at different depths using a cabled vertical line array from two cruises during flood and ebb tidal periods in May and June 2011. The ambient noise level decreases approximately 5 dB re 1 mu Pa per octave for frequency ranges of 1-70 kHz and increases approximately 5 dB re 1 mu Pa per octave for the frequency from 70 to 100 kHz. The difference between noise pressure levels in different months varies from 10 to 30 dB re 1 mu Pa for the frequency range below 70 kHz. Commercial shipping and ferry vessel traffic were found to be the most significant contributors to sound pressure levels for the frequency range of 1-50 kHz, and the variation could be as high as 30 dB re 1 mu Pa. These noise level measurements provide the basic information for designing and evaluating both active and passive monitoring systems proposed for deployment and operation of a tidal power generation alert system.",,,,,,,,,4,0,0,0,1,0,4,,,0025-3324,1948-1209,,,,,,,,,,"Pacific NW Natl Lab, Richland, WA 99352 USA",,,,2012-03-01,WOS:000303963900006,,

Several attempts have been made to address these issues, but the cost and sustainability of current methodologies are still a concern. Cultivation of photosynthetic microorganisms appears as a sustainable solution because: (i) they can effectively uptake CO2 and nutrients, such as nitrogen and phosphorus; and (ii) the resulting biomass can be processed into valuable products. In this study, the effect of different CO2 concentrations (from approximately 0.04 to 10% v/v) on CO2 capture, biomass production and nutrients (nitrogen and phosphorus) uptake was assessed for the microalgae Chlorella vulgaris and Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata and the cyanobacteria Synechocystis salina and Microcystis aeruginosa grown at laboratory scale under batch mode. For the studied range of CO2 concentrations, C. vulgaris, S. salina and M. aeruginosa have reached the highest biomass productivities (0.126 +/- 0.033 g(dw) L-1 d(-1)) and carbon fixation rates (0.101 +/- 0.027 g(C) L-1 d(-1)). These microorganisms have also been effective in nutrients uptake, reaching removal efficiencies close to 100%. Through mathematical modelling, it was possible to conclude that optimal CO2 concentration for these microorganisms was 5.35 +/- 0.34% (v/v). (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

There has been a prodigious number of advances made in the development of technically-reliable membranes. As a result, the use of membrane units has increased in natural gas treatment plants, particularly for acid gas removal. Apart from explaining separation fundamentals, this paper covers the development history, application record, separation capability, pretreatment requirements and the operational limitations of the well-recognized commercial membranes. Furthermore, the paper discusses process intensification of membrane units, i.e., the optimization of the membrane unit design to yield the targeted separation at the minimum cost, and at the least physical/environmental footprints. The paper clarifies that the advantages offered by the membrane technology may not necessarily qualify it for adoption in onshore applications. However, the membrane technology is definitely the preferred solution in offshore applications.",,,,,,,,,49,6,0,0,3,0,60,,,0255-2701,1873-3204,,,,,,,,,,"Univ British Columbia, Dept Mech Engn, Okanagan Campus, Kelowna, BC, Canada",,,,2017-11-19,WOS:000412040700009,,

B. cereus stood out as the best biosurfactant producer when inoculated with a 1.5% cell suspension and cultivated at 28 degrees C and 200 rpm in 2.0% molasses and 1.0% corn steep liquor for 48 h. Under these conditions, medium surface tension was reduced to 26.2 +/- 0.2 mN/m, and biosurfactant concentration achieved 2.05 +/- 0.32 g/L. The biosurfactant showed a critical micelle concentration of 0.90 +/- 0.05 g/L, proved to be highly stable in wide ranges of pH, salt concentration and heating temperature, and exerted low toxicity to larvae of Artemia salina as a marine environmental bioindicator. Structural characterisation of biosurfactant suggested a lipopeptide composition. The biotensioactive agent was shown to effectively remove motor oil adsorbed to marine rock (91.0 +/- 0.4%) and to disperse it in seawater (70.0 +/- 0.4%). The biosurfactant formulated with 0.2% potassium sorbate demonstrated considerable potential for application in the petroleum industry, where it could be successfully used as a commercial product to mobilize oil in marine environments.",,,,,,,,,31,0,0,0,15,0,31,,,0168-1656,1873-4863,,,,,,,,,,"Catholic Univ Pernambuco UNICAP, Rua Principe,526, BR-50050900 Recife, PE, BrazilAdv Inst Technol & Innovat IATI, Rua Joaquim de Brito,216, BR-50070280 Recife, PE, BrazilUniv Fed Pernambuco, Dept Antibiot, Ave Prof Moraes Rego,1235,Cidade Univ, BR-50670901 Recife, PE, BrazilGenoa Univ, Pole Chem Engn, Dept Civil Chem & Environm Engn, Via Opera Pia 15, I-16145 Genoa, Italy",Adv Inst Technol & Innovat IATI,,,2019-04-02,WOS:000462026000010,30871886,

While the pH-dependent behavior of select IOCs is well-understood, complex mixtures of IOCs, e.g., from oil sands process-affected water (OSPW), have not yet been studied systematically. Here, we established an in vitro screening method using the rainbow trout gill cell line, RTgill-W1, to investigate pH-dependent cytotoxicity and permeation of IOCs across cultured epithelia using ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography with high-resolution mass spectrometry (UPLC-HRMS). The assay was benchmarked using model chemicals and technical mixtures, and then used to characterize fractions and reconstituted extracts of field-collected OSPW. Significant pH-dependent cytotoxicity of individual IOCs, acidic fractions, and reconstituted extracts of OSPW was observed. In vitro data were in good agreement with data from a 96 h in vivo exposure experiment with juvenile rainbow trout. Permeation of some IOCs from OSPW was mediated by active transport, as revealed by studies in which inhibitors of these active transport mechanisms were applied. We conclude that the RTgill-W1 in vitro assay is useful for the screening of pH-dependent uptake of IOCs in fish, and has applications for in vitro-in vivo extrapolation, and prioritization of chemicals in nontarget screenings.",,,,,,,,,7,1,0,0,7,0,9,,,0013-936X,1520-5851,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Saskatchewan, Sch Environm & Sustainabil SENS, Toxicol Ctr, Saskatoon, SK S7N 5C8, CanadaUniv Saskatchewan, Global Inst Water Secur GIWS, Saskatoon, SK S7N 5C8, CanadaKing Saud Univ, Coll Food & Agr Sci, Dept Plant Protect, Riyadh 11451, Saudi ArabiaUniv Saskatchewan, Toxicol Ctr, Saskatoon, SK S7N 5B3, CanadaUniv Lethbridge, Dept Biol Sci, Lethbridge, AB T1K 3M4, CanadaUniv Toronto, Dept Chem, Toronto, ON MSS 3H6, CanadaUniv Saskatchewan, Toxicol Ctr, Saskatoon, SK 57N 5B3, CanadaUniv Saskatchewan, Dept Vet Biomed Sci, Saskatoon, SK 57N 5B3, CanadaMichigan State Univ, Dept Zool, E Lansing, MI 48824 USAMichigan State Univ, Ctr Integrat Toxicol, E Lansing, MI 48824 USABaylor Univ, Dept Environm Sci, Waco, TX 76706 USAUniv Saskatchewan, Sch Environm & Sustainabil SENS, Saskatoon, SK 57N 5C8, CanadaUniv Saskatchewan, Toxicol Ctr, Saskatoon, SK 57N 5C8, Canada",,,,2020-08-26,WOS:000558753900040,32639732,

All sites were sampled in early 2002 and 2003. Increasing organic matter removal significantly decreased the mass of the FH layer in the treatment plots, the moisture content in the FH layer and mineral soil, the concentration of carbon in the FH layer and mineral soil, the pool of carbon stored in the FH layer, the concentration of nitrogen in the mineral soil and the pool of nitrogen stored in the FH layer. Mineral soil pH was significantly increased with increasing organic matter removal. The persistence of the significant differences in the FH layer and mineral soil characteristics strongly suggested that variations in organic matter removal have long-term effects on forest floor properties, and significantly influences carbon storage over the life of the rotation.

Therefore, the GHG management from oil and gas facilities is still a priority. Continuous various efforts such as reduction in flaring, waste-water treatment before discharging to the environment, and oil spill prevention have encouraged the waste management to follow the model of prevention, such as reuse, recycle, recovery, etc. Those countermeasure techniques are widely implemented by oil and gas industries towards environmental performance at the work site and its surrounding area. This paper is mainly focused on the Barton field located at the off coast of Sabah, Malaysia. Due to the advancement at Barton field, overabundance of GHG emission is one of the main issues.

Species-specific and common above- and belowground biomass models for three mangrove species were therefore developed. The species-specific models fitted better to data than the common models. The former models are recommended for accurate estimation of biomass stored in mangrove forests of Tanzania.Mangroves are essential for climate change mitigation through carbon storage and sequestration. Biomass models are important tools for quantifying biomass and carbon stock. While numerous aboveground biomass models exist, very few studies have focused on belowground biomass, and among these, mangroves of Africa are hardly or not represented.The aims of the study were to develop above- and belowground biomass models and to evaluate the predictive accuracy of existing aboveground biomass models developed for mangroves in other regions and neighboring countries when applied on data from Tanzania.Data was collected through destructive sampling of 120 trees (aboveground biomass), among these 30 trees were sampled for belowground biomass. The data originated from four sites along the Tanzanian coastline covering three dominant species: Avicennia marina (Forssk.) Vierh, Sonneratia alba J. Smith, and Rhizophora mucronata Lam. The biomass models were developed through mixed modelling leading to fixed effects/common models and random effects/species-specific models.Both the above- and belowground biomass models improved when random effects (species) were considered. Inclusion of total tree height as predictor variable, in addition to diameter at breast height alone, further improved the model predictive accuracy. The tests of existing models from other regions on our data generally showed large and significant prediction errors for aboveground tree biomass.Inclusion of random effects resulted into improved goodness of fit for both above- and belowground biomass models. Species-specific models therefore are recommended for accurate biomass estimation of mangrove forests in Tanzania for both management and ecological applications. For belowground biomass (S. alba) however, the fixed effects/common model is recommended.",,,,,,,,,25,2,0,0,19,0,26,,,1286-4560,1297-966X,,,,,,,,,,"Sokoine Univ Agr, Dept Forest Mensurat & Management, POB 3013, Morogoro, TanzaniaNorwegian Univ Life Sci, Dept Ecol & Nat Resources Management, As, Norway",,,,2016-06-22,WOS:000376998600014,,

Accordingly, this study evaluates the natural seismic activity which may disturb the long-term and large-scale CO2 storage potential of several saline aquifers in southern Israel. This work is part of the characterization of the proposed sequestration sites in Israel and is based on all the existing seismological and earthquake related data. First all the historical and modern earthquake catalogs were gathered and the pattern of seismicity in space and time in relation with the study area was examined. Our perspective is then extended beyond the limited term exhibited by these records, and resorted to all the available neotectonics elements, namely geomorphic features, stress field indicators and geodetic measurements.Based on the seismotectonics of the research area, the areas relevant to CO2 storage is constrained in accordance with the following leading criteria: (1) farther than 10 km away from any Md > 3 seismic event, and (2) at least 10 km away from potential surface rupture (active faults in terms of the Israeli building code) and other major fault zones. These were integrated with the additional criteria of: (1) more than 800 m depth to the top of the aquifer, and (2) more than 100 m thickness of the capping sealing aquitard, that were determined previously (Calvo and Gvirtzman, 2013, IJGGC 14: 25-38). Overall, the area relevant for CO2 storage in Israel is reduced to about 4250 km(2). Three proposed storage sites were examined and found to be located well within the reduced area of interest (AOI), at least 36 km away from the nearest recorded Md > 3.0 earthquake. These outcomes are presented on a summary map, an effective way to explain this process and outcomes to the decision makers.Henceforth, there is the need to set threshold criteria that will guide the collecting of the missing data, fill the knowledge gaps and direct future investigations. Such are, for example, the accurate monitoring of natural weak seismicity and the state of stress within the proposed sites. Hazards that cannot be measured directly will need modeling and sensitivity analysis such as the potential role of the present day stress field and induced seismicity, whether they are capable of damaging the integrity of the potential aquitard. These actions will allow determining whether the proposed sites do meet with the necessary requirements and predicting the behavior of the reservoir rocks under different conditions until failure and escape of the sequestrated material.

Primary driving forces have been the NORSOK initiative to reduce overall project costs and new legislation on health, safety and environment. Four cases are presented, where risk analysis methods and practices have been changed to meet new needs. These cover needs of input to the selection of one platform concept from alternative standard concepts, specification and qualification of cost-efficient safety measures and analysis of the risk of occupational accidents. It is concluded that research may support the development processes through systematic evaluation and documentation. Significant areas of interest are standardization of risk acceptance criteria, development of risk analysis methods for special applications and evaluations of safety management programmes.

On December 25th, some heavy fuel oil released by the tanker came ashore along the French Atlantic Coast. Some oil residues and oiled bird feathers were collected all along the Atlantic Shoreline of France after the wreck of the Erika tanker. The aim of this study was to differentiate oil residues and oiled bird feathers related to the Erika oil spill from the ones resulting from the numerous tar ball incidents which had accurred after the Erika oil spill. Alkane and PAH quantification of oil residues allowed differentiation of the samples collected on the north part of the Atlantic Coast from those collected on the south part of the Atlantic shoreline. All oiled birds appear to have been contaminated by the Erika oil. Samples collected on the south part of the Atlantic Coast contain a different molecular fingerprint compared to the Erika oil indicating that they are not related to the Erika oil spill. Bulk and molecular (13)C/(12)C ratio measurements were performed in order to check the discriminative feature and the stability of the isotopic approach. Bulk stable carbon isotopic composition has been shown to be a valuable screening correlation tool as it confirms the link of samples collected in the north part of the Atlantic Coast with the Erika oil spill. All the samples collected along the south part of the Atlantic Shoreline exhibit (13)C-enriched bulk isotopic compositions compared to Erika oil. Molecular isotopic composition of saturated hydrocarbons and of phenanthrene compounds also allows unambiguous differentiation of samples related to the Erika oil spill from those due to tar ball incidents. Over the long-term, when molecular distribution will have been modified by the different processes affecting oil in the marine environment, molecular isotopic composition should then be of particular help for Erika oil residues identification.",,,,,,,,,40,7,0,0,15,0,47,,,0013-936X,,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Bordeaux 1, Lab Physico & Toxicochim Syst Nat, CNRS, UMR 5472, F-33405 Talence, France",,,,2002-01-15,WOS:000173308400003,11827045,

To mitigate mortality at this time, rescue programs are implemented near breeding sites around the world, especially for birds grounded by artificial lights. We evaluated the plumage and body condition of short-tailed shearwater (Ardenna tenuirostris) fledglings captured at colonies just before departure in comparison to fledglings washed up on beaches and to fledglings attracted by artificial light along roads. We measured abundance of down, body mass, and body condition index as the standardized residuals of a regression of body mass on size, and employed linear models to test differences on body mass and body condition between locations. Beach-washed birds were underweight and in poor condition, suggesting their future survival probabilities at sea were low. Birds rescued on roads as a consequence of light attraction had lower body weights and condition indices than fledglings captured at the colony. However, more than 50% of light-attracted birds had attained similar weights to those of adults, suggesting they have higher probabilities of survival than beach-washed birds. Water-logged birds being washed onto beaches is a natural process, but birds grounded by lighting along roads is an increasing anthropogenic threat that requires management. Thus, management and conservation efforts should be directed to protect birds in the colonies and reduce light-induced mortality, ideally through the strategic reduction of light sources and lateral light spillage. When resources for conservation are limited, rescue programs should focus on rescuing birds from roads rather than beach-washed birds, which have a lower probability of survival. (c) 2017 The Wildlife Society.Short-tailed shearwater fledglings rescued on roads as a consequence of light attraction had higher body weights than beach-washed fledglings on Phillip Island, Australia, and consequently higher probabilities of survival.

One of the systems used to insure reliability of a pipeline, is the Leak Detection System (LDS). Different leak detection systems use different technologies for detecting and locating leaks that could result from pipelines. One technology in particular that is gaining wide acceptance by the industry is the optical leak detection systems. This technology has great potential for subsea pipelines applications. It is the most suited for underwater applications due to the ease of installation and reliable sensing capabilities. Having pipelines underwater in the deep sea present a greater challenge and a potential threat to the environment and operation. Thus, there is a need to have a reliable and effective system to provide the assurances that the monitored subsea pipeline is safe and functioning as per operating conditions. Two important performance parameters that are of concern to operators are the probability of detection and probability of false alarm.

This is a problem shared with terrestrial archaeology, but is particularly acute due to the limitations of survey techniques in the underwater environment. In Scotland <15% of known ship losses from the last 200 years have been located and the record is far less comprehensive for earlier periods, verging on a near total data gap. Most known archaeological sites in Scottish waters have been discovered through large-scale sonar survey of relatively low resolution and a considerable bias has been introduced in the archaeological record; this has favored the discovery and documentation of larger and more recent, often upstanding, metal shipwrecks. This article presents the methods and results from a three-year project designed to reduce this bias by demonstrating large-scale prospecting for maritime archaeology through a community-based crowd-sourcing approach. Project SAMPHIRE (the Scottish Atlantic Maritime Past: Heritage, Investigation, Research and Education Project) was geographically focused on the west coast of the Scottish mainland and was undertaken between 2013 and 2015, resulting in a large number of new archaeological discoveries, including shipwrecks, aircraft, and other material of a much more varied nature than what is typically found through large-scale hydrographic surveys.",,,,,,,,,3,0,0,0,0,0,3,,,1556-4894,1556-1828,,,,,,,,,,"Flinders Univ S Australia, Dept Archaeol, Adelaide, SA, AustraliaWessex Archaeol Coastal & Marine, Edinburgh, Midlothian, Scotland",Wessex Archaeol Coastal & Marine,,,2019-07-02,WOS:000472123200006,,

It is safe, has simple operability, and has portable design with a small deck space requirement. However, the high operating cost that mainly accounts for the shaft work requirement in the compression units of the refrigeration cycle, is still a major ongoing issue associated with nitrogen expander liquefaction processes. This high operating cost increases the total annualized costs of the N-2 expander liquefaction technology, and this ultimately reduces its global competitiveness of the process. Recent developments in expansion devices pave the way toward the handling of gas-liquid (two-phase) refrigerant in an isentropic manner instead of an isenthalpic one. This study presents the propane-nitrogen two-phase dual expander liquefaction process for offshore applications. A bio-inspired strategy named biogeography is used to confirm the overall energy savings with minimal total annualized costs. The results show that the proposed liquefaction technology gives 36.6% operating cost savings, and this confirms a 16.5% saving in total annualized costs compared with the conventional nitrogen dual gas-phase expander liquefaction process.

These protect against corrosion and sub-optimal dosage can cause pipeline integrity issues as well as processing and environmental consequences.Managing the integrity of oil and gas assets is a priority for oil companies. One cause of loss of integrity is corrosion and a number of tools are used to manage this corrosion risk. Corrosion inhibitors are used to protect the infrastructure but current chemical monitoring products, particularly those available for onsite use, can be unreliable in the complex fluids found in the field. CoMic™ has been developed to provide a much needed onsite tool to optimise corrosion inhibitor dosage. Expected cost savings, smoother running processes and reduced environmental discharges have been key drivers of the technology.This project has taken the technology from concept, through initial testing and lab qualification to a first test in the field. We have presented the technical developments to key opinion leaders and during the course of this project, have built a database of end users who are keen to deploy the technology. We are now well positioned for a formal launch of the CoMic™ product later in 2012.

Large-scale dieback not only leads to considerable carbon emissions but often leads to loss of ecological resources. We investigated whether, and how, the structure, composition and carbon content changed over a period of extended drought (the Big Dry') in a much-modified forest ecosystem. We explored whether landscape configuration, management practice or soil type influenced vegetation change.LocationThe Box-Ironbark forests of south-eastern Australia.MethodsIn 2010, we remeasured 120 forest transects that had first been measured in 1997 by using identical field methods. Vegetation structure and composition were quantified. We used allometric growth models to estimate the expected increase in above-ground carbon (AGC) storage between 1997 and 2010; these estimates were compared with observed values.ResultsForest structure was systematically different between the two periods. Canopy cover, shrub cover and litter decreased between the 1997 and 2010 surveys, whereas total basal area of dead trees, dead trees in all size classes and saplings increased between the two surveys. Climate, fragment size and their interaction were the major predictors of change in most of the measured vegetation characteristics. By comparing measured AGC in 2010 and estimates from growth models, we estimated that 5.62.1 SE t C ha(-1) may have been foregone over the Big Dry.Main conclusionsOur findings add to the evidence linking climate change to negative effects on vegetation, including mortality, canopy dieback and reduced carbon sequestration. These effects may be amplified in fragmented vegetation because of greater water and heat stress. If the carbon sequestration deficit of c.5.6 t C ha(-1) were to apply across the extant Box-Ironbark forests of Victoria (c.255,400ha), then 1.43 Mt of carbon sequestration may not have occurred during the Big Dry.",,,,,,,,,26,1,0,0,24,0,27,,,1466-822X,1466-8238,,,,,,,,,,"Monash Univ, Sch Biol Sci, Australian Ctr Biodivers, Clayton, Vic 3800, Australia",,,,2013-12-04,WOS:000326649100001,,

Consequently, this has elevated the sector as a key plank for economic development, and its utility is deeply embedded in political, economic and social-ecological discourse. Where the expansion of the sector leverages natural and cultural landscapes, this applies pressure to social and ecological underpinnings that if not reconciled, can become problematic. The way this plays out in Australia's Shipwreck Coast and the wider Great Ocean Road region, especially the implications for community resilience, is the focus. Emphasis is placed on the vulnerability of peripheral coastal areas to development that withdraws from destination endowments, yet fails to provide commensurate economic yield as a suitable trade-off. This is obvious where tourism intensification has led to concerns about the breach of normative carrying capacities. Temporal overtourism driven by seasonal overcrowding is countenanced as emblematic of tourism in the Anthropocene where focus tends to be largely growth-oriented, with much less attention given to bolstering social-ecological resilience, especially community resilience.

Predicting biomass consumption by fire at large spatial scales is essential to understanding carbon dynamics and hence how fire management can reduce greenhouse gas emissions and increase ecosystem carbon storage. An Australia-wide field-based survey (at 113 locations) across large-scale macroecological gradients (climate, productivity and fire regimes) enabled estimation of how biomass combustion by surface fire directly affects continental-scale carbon budgets. In terms of biomass consumption, we found clear trade-offs between the frequency and severity of surface fires. In temperate southern Australia, characterised by less frequent and more severe fires, biomass consumed per fire was typically very high. In contrast, surface fires in the tropical savannas of northern Australia were very frequent but less severe, with much lower consumption of biomass per fire (about a quarter of that in the far south). When biomass consumption was expressed on an annual basis, biomass consumed was far greater in the tropical savannas (>20 times that of the far south). This trade-off is also apparent in the ratio of annual carbon consumption to net primary production (NPP). Across Australia's naturally vegetated land area, annual carbon consumption by surface fire is equivalent to about 11% of NPP, with a sharp contrast between temperate southern Australia (6%) and tropical northern Australia (46%). Our results emphasise that fire management to reduce greenhouse gas emissions should focus on fire prone tropical savanna landscapes, where the vast bulk of biomass consumption occurs globally.

The remote site has been untouched since a crude oil spill in 1972, offering a rare opportunity to examine natural attenuation in Arctic soils >40 years after a pollution event. Bacterial community composition in crude oil contaminated soils was significantly different from adjacent background soils. Two members of the genus Rhodanobacter (Alphaproteobacteria) were found consistently in contaminated soils, whereas two members of the genus Sphingomonas (Gammaproteobacteria) appeared opposite to each other, one consistently within the oil contaminated soil and the other consistently in non-oil contaminated soils. GC of soil hydrocarbon extracts revealed moderate levels of biodegradation relative to the original oil produced in 1972. Despite conditions permissive for bacterial activity (>0 degrees C) being limited to only a few months each year, natural attenuation by cold adapted soil microbial communities has taken place since the oil spill over 40 years ago. Rhodanobacter and Sphingomonas lineages are associated with contaminated and baseline conditions in this extreme environment, revealing the utility of bacterial diversity measurements for assessing long-term responses of Arctic soils to pollution.Originality-significance statement: Romulus C-42, the northernmost onshore drilling well in the world, was decommissioned following a small crude oil spill in 1972. Soil bacterial diversity profiles obtained >40 years later revealed significant differences in oil contaminated soils relative to adjacent non-oil contaminated background soils, consistent with evidence for moderate biodegradation of spilled crude oil having taken place since 1972. The results indicate that microbial diversity profiling is an effective tool for assessing natural attenuation in remote High Arctic soils with a history of oil pollution. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

To explore how changes in nutrient availability affect ecosystem carbon (C) cycling, we used radiocarbon to quantify changes in belowground C dynamics associated with long-term fertilization of graminoid-dominated tussock tundra at Toolik Lake, Alaska. Since 1981, yearly fertilization with nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) has resulted in a shift to shrub-dominated vegetation. These combined changes have altered the quantity and quality of litter inputs, the vertical distribution and dynamics of fine roots, and the decomposition rate of soil organic C. The loss of C from the deep organic and mineral soil has more than offset the C accumulation in the litter and upper organic soil horizons. In the litter and upper organic horizons, radiocarbon measurements show that increased inputs resulted in overall C accumulation, despite being offset by increased decomposition in some soil pools. To reconcile radiocarbon observations in the deeper organic and mineral soil layers, where most of the ecosystem C loss occurred, both a decrease in input of new root material and a dramatic increase of decomposition rates in centuries-old soil C pools were required. Therefore, with future increases in nutrient availability, we may expect substantial losses of C which took centuries to accumulate.",,,,,,,,,65,3,0,0,46,0,81,,,1432-9840,1435-0629,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Calif Irvine, Dept Earth Syst Sci, Irvine, CA 92697 USAUniv Florida, Dept Bot, Gainesville, FL 32611 USAMarine Biol Labs, Ctr Ecosyst, Woods Hole, MA 02543 USA",,,,2008-02-01,WOS:000253359600003,,

Additionally, the distribution of the remaining oil is very scattered. In order to effectively assess the potential of the remaining oil, the logging evaluation of the water-flooded layers and the distribution rule of the. remaining oil are studied. Based on the log response characteristics, the water-flooded layers can be qualitatively identified. On the basis of the mercury injection experimental data of the evaluation wells, the calculation model of the initial oil saturation is built. Based on conventional logging data, the evaluation model of oil saturation is established. The difference between the initial oil saturation and the residual oil saturation can be used to quantitatively evaluate the. water-flooded layers. The evaluation result of the water-flooded layers is combined with the ratio of the water-flooded wells in the. marine sandstone reservoirs. As a result, the degree of water flooding in. the marine sandstone reservoirs can be assessed. On the basis of structural characteristics and sedimentary environments, the horizontal and vertical water-flooding rules of the different types of reservoirs are elaborated upon, and the distribution rule of the remaining oil is disclosed. The remaining oil is mainly distributed in the high parts of the structure. The remaining oil exists in the top of the reservoirs with good physical properties while the thickness of the remaining oil. ranges from 2-5 m. However, the thickness of the remaining oil of the reservoirs with poor physical properties ranges from 5-8 m. The high production of some of the drilled horizontal wells. shows that the above distribution rule of the remaining oil is accurate.

Many authors already use this integrated method to investigate interest areas in, both, commercial and scientific aspect. In this direction the current study initiated in 2009 in the frame of the Geochemistry Network PETROBRAS/CENPES, aims to track the quaternary evolution of a muddy bank situated at the coastal western boundary upwelling system (WBUS) off Cabo Frio (23 degrees S) in the Atlantic Ocean. The WBUS is located at the north coast of the Rio de Janeiro State, Brazil. Here the coastline orientation differs from the default East-West direction of the Brazilian coast, concomitant with the boundary of the Campos and Santos Basins, the most important oil and gas basins of the country. The upwelling phenomenon occurs due to constant northeast winds. The same winds combined with the Northeast-Southwest coastline orientation also promote a curl confluence making the environment even more complex. Seismic data was acquired in cruises on board the RV Ocean Survey. Altogether 680 km was covered by a 3.5 KHz sub-bottom using the Geopulse Geoacustic System. Further, four piston cores were collected to be scan and described in physic parameters and sedimentological content, respectively. The scan was performed using a Geotek Multi Sensor Core Logger (MSCL), which measure and register the Vp, gamma density and porosity of the core. After the scan, the cores were sample and analyzed on sedimentological grain size distribution determined by a Cilas 1064 laser analyzer. The results were integrated in order to identify common trends. Three major echo-characters were described in seismic records. Grain size analysis presented a good relationship with these echos. Echo A) Transparent, represented by a sharp bottom reflector with no sub-bottom reflectors scatter of a transparent layer mapped in seismic records. The grain size distribution is more balanced with a slight higher content of sands (55 %) in the correspondent core. Echo B) Stratified described as a series of parallel sub-bottom horizons, its percentage of clays is the highest of the three cores (77 %). The last echo, C) Reflexive, is a prolonged echo with one or none sub-bottom reflector. This echo is related to the highest percentage of sands of the three cores (61%).

The riser is essentially a vertical or near-vertical pipe connecting the sea-bed collection pipe network (the flowlines) to a sea-surface installation, typically a floating receiving and processing vessel. In the early years of oil and gas exploration and production, the oil and gas companies selected the largest and most accessible off-shore fields to develop first. In these systems, the risers were relatively short and had modest diameters. However, as these fields are being depleted, the oil and gas companies are being forced to look further afield for replacement reserves capable of being developed economically. This, then, has led to increased interest in deeper waters, and harsher and more remote environments, most notably in the Gulf of Mexico, the Brazilian Campos basin, West of Shetlands and the Angolan Aptian basin. Many of the major deepwater developments are located in water depths exceeding 1km (e.g. Elf's Girassol at 1300m or Petrobras' Roncador at 1500-2000m). To transport the produced fluids in such systems with the available pressure driving forces has led naturally to the specification of risers of much greater diameter (typically 300 mm) than those used previously (typically 75 mm). Investments in such systems have been, and will continue to be, huge (around $35 billion up to 2005) with the riser systems accounting for around 20% of the costs. Prediction of the performance of the multiphase flow riser systems is of vital importance but, very unfortunately, available methods for such prediction are of doubtful validity. The main reason for this is that the available data and methods have been based on measurements on smaller diameter tubes (typically 25-75 mm) and on the interpretation of these measurements in terms of the flow patterns occurring in such tubes. These flow patterns are typically bubble, slug, churn and annular flows. The limited amount of data available shows that the flow patterns in larger tubes may be quite different and that, within a given flow pattern, the detailed phenomena may also be different. For instance, there are reasons to believe that slug flow of the normal type (with liquid slugs separated by Taylor bubbles of classical shape) may not exist in large pipes. Methods to predict such flows with confidence will be improved significantly by means of an integrated programme of work at three universities (Nottingham, Cranfield and Imperial College) which will involve both larger scale investigations as well as investigations into specific phenomena at a more intimate scale together with modelling studies.

To assess the feasibility of storing carbon as cultivated halophyte residues in coastal desert soils, the decay rate, microbial activity and microbial decomposer abundance of postharvest residues were investigated for three potential halophyte crops. Decay rates were determined by measuring weight loss from residues in litterbags in both the field and laboratory. The effect of incorporating residues into the soil was examined by locating litterbags both on and below the soil surface. Microbial decomposition activity was measured as the CO(2) efflux from residue amended soil columns in the greenhouse. The abundance of bacteria, fungi, and nematodes was assessed in decomposing residues using litterbags in the field. The three halophytes decomposed at rates similar to those of conventional, non-saline residues (0.20-0.30% d(-1)) whether placed on the surface or buried at 30 cm. Residue type affected microbial activity in soil columns during the first 21 days, but decomposition was similar for the three halophytes thereafter. Residue type affected the abundance of nematodes, but not of bacterial and fungal decomposers. Because the rate of halophyte residue decay and the number of microbial decomposers associated with the residues are similar to those of fresh water systems, there appears to be no advantage in storing carbon as plant residue in this saline agricultural system.",,,,,,,,,6,0,0,0,5,0,6,,,0032-079X,,,,,,,,,,,"Michigan State Univ, Kellogg Biol Stn, Hickory Corners, MI 49060 USAUniv Arizona, Dept Plant Pathol, Tucson, AZ 85721 USAUniv Arizona, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA",,,,1998-05-01,WOS:000076471200009,,

The UK Health and Safety Executive's (UK HSE's) hydrocarbon release database (the HCR) is one of the best sources [UK HSE, 2005]. It is a collection of information on releases in the UK sector of the North Sea since 1992. For a modest annual fee the records for all hydrocarbon releases can be downloaded. The database also holds information on the amount of installed equipment, and, although this cannot be downloaded, the web-based interface allows queries to be posted which return the number of events, and the number of equipment years relevant to the query. In this roundabout way it is possible to obtain information on the installed equipment base.The HCR has been the basis of many analyses of frequency of releases and probabilities of ignition, and the results from these analyses are increasingly being incorporated in the rule sets of operating companies, thereby displacing rules based on a number of older sources including the Hydrocarbon Leak and Ignition Database report by the E&P Forum (which subsequently became the International Association of Oil and Gas Producers) [E&P Forum, 1992] and the book Classification of Hazardous Locations published by the Institute of Chemical Engineers [Cox, 1991].Although the HCR data has been gathered since 1992, and currently comprises some 3500 entries, it is still statistically sparse on the larger releases that result in major safety hazards. This provides a particular challenge for those wishing to estimate the releases from equipment for which the installed base is relatively small (for example there are a very large number of flanges but relatively few compressors).However, for the HSE consultant with global reach, one of the biggest challenges is whether the release and ignition frequencies deduced from the HCR can be applied in operations where the gas contains appreciable H2S (sour gas), or where the winter conditions might require enclosure of the modules and forced ventilation, or for completely unrelated areas such as service stations handling compressed natural gas or even hydrogen.In order to decide whether the HCR data can be used it has been necessary to delve slightly deeper into the data, and aspects of this are discussed.",,,,,20th Hazards Symposium - Process Safety and Environmental Protection-Harnessing knowledge - Challenging complacency20th Hazards Symposium - Process Safety and Environmental Protection-Harnessing knowledge - Challenging complacency,"APR 14-17, 2008APR 14-17, 2008",Inst Chem Engineers (N W Branch)Inst Chem Engineers (N W Branch),ENGLANDENGLAND,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,0374-1753,,978-0-85295-523-9,,,,,,,,,,,,,2008-01-01,WOS:000305386400054,,

We observed post- flood differences in the degree of decay, age, and concentration of dissolved organic carbon (DOC), as well as dissolved CH4 and CO2 concentrations throughout the study site. Our results indicate that this flooded waterway was a limited source of CH4 and CO2 to the atmosphere during the event and that DOC age increased with time of flooding. Based on our findings, we suggest that the interplay between storage and mobilization of carbon and greenhouse gases in arid and semiarid regions is potentially sensitive to changing climate conditions, particularly hydrologic variability. Changes in the radiocarbon age of DOC throughout the flooding event suggest that organic matter (OM) that had been stored for long periods (e.g., millennial) was mobilized by the flooding event along with CO2. The OM residing in the dry riverbed that was mobilized into floodwaters had a signature reflective of degraded vascular plant OM and microbial biomass. Whether this microbial OM was living or dead, our findings support previous work in soils and natural waters showing that microbial OM can remain stable and stored in ecosystems for long time periods. As human appropriation of water resources continues to increase, the episodic drying and rewetting of once natural riverbeds and deltas may fundamentally alter the processing and storage of carbon in such systems.",,,,,,,,,7,1,0,0,7,0,9,,,2169-8953,2169-8961,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Florida, Dept Geol Sci, Gainesville, FL USAUniv Washington, Sch Environm & Forest Sci & Civil & Environm Engn, Seattle, WA USAYale Univ, Sch Forestry & Environm Studies, New Haven, CT USAPacific Nortwest Natl Lab, Marine Sci Lab, Washington, DC USAUniv Arizona, Dept Geosci, Tucson, AZ USAUniv Autonoma Baja Calif, Dept Hidrolog, Mexicali, Baja California, Mexico",,,,2017-03-01,WOS:000398923300011,,

Whole-plant litter (stems and leaves) also decomposes at a much slower annual rate for P. australis (k = 0.25) than S patens litter (k = 0.57).

The size and weight of the risers and BOP stack has grown significantly. These factors have led to an increase in fatigue loads imposed on the wellhead structures during drilling and completion operations. Wellhead fatigue might ultimately lead to loss of well structural integrity and pressure containment and therefore safe and reliable drilling of subsea wellheads has gained high priority in the global oil and gas industry. This paper presents two of the most complex real time instrumentation campaigns for drilling operations.Analyses of a connected drilling riser system including the well structure are complex and involve several engineering disciplines. In addition, there are many unknowns going into the equations when accumulated fatigue damage of the wellhead is estimated. Therefore, assumptions need to be made, very often on the conservative side. A typical example are the global drilling riser analyses where the environmental conditions, actual rig motion and riser / BOP behavior are uncertain.With the duplex scope of accurately documenting the wellhead fatigue status during drilling operations and of achieving a better understanding of the actual risk level of wellhead fatigue, Statoil decided to start a very comprehensive monitoring campaign. Two MODU representing very different generations of rigs in terms of weights and types of equipment were instrumented from topside to BOP connector. Strain gauges were installed around the BOP connector as close as possible to the wellhead in order to capture wellhead response as accurately as possible. Due to the large number of sensors, high accuracy requirement and high sampling frequency of data to be shown live, a cabled solution was selected vs remote battery operated sensors transmitting via acoustic. Double set of cables, sensors and topside equipment were installed in order to make the instrumentation system fully redundant and suited for permanent installation. All data were additionally made available real time onshore to allow the full overview of the operation. To author's knowledge, these two instrumentation systems are the most comprehensive and complex of this type installed on a drilling riser as of today. The first of the two system was installed approximately three years ago and it is still in operation. This paper describes the instrumentation systems installed and gives an extract of the quality data extracted and already used in already published studies [1, 2, 3].",,,,,"36th ASME International Conference on Ocean, Offshore and Arctic Engineering36th ASME International Conference on Ocean, Offshore and Arctic Engineering","JUN 25-30, 2017JUN 25-30, 2017","ASME, Ocean Offshore & Arctic Engn DivASME, Ocean Offshore & Arctic Engn Div","Trondheim, NORWAYTrondheim, NORWAY",4,0,0,0,0,0,4,,,,,978-0-7918-5766-3,,,,,,,,,"Statoil ASA, Stjordal, NorwayKongsberg Maritime Inc, Houston, TX USAStatoil ASA, Fornebu, Norway",Kongsberg Maritime Inc,,,2017-12-27,WOS:000417224700051,,

(2) An Upper Devonian to Lower Carboniferous (Tournaisian) magmatic arc succession developed on the passive margin. (3) A Lower Carboniferous (?Visean) to Permian rift-passive margin succession. (4) A Triassic continental magmatic arc succession.The Mesozoic-Palaeogene cover has three units: (1) A ?Late Triassic to Middle Jurassic rift succession is dominated by variable continental elastics. Thick, coarse, lenticular coal-bearing clastics were deposited by braided and meandering streams in linear grabens, while bauxites formed on the adjacent horsts. (2) A Middle to Upper Jurassic transgressive-regressive succession consists of mixed continental and marine Bathonian to Lower Kimmeridgian elastics and carbonates overlain by regressive Upper Kimmeridgian-Tithonian evaporite-bearing elastics. (3) A Cretaceous succession consists of Lower Cretaceous red beds with evaporites, resting unconformably on Jurassic and older deposits, overlain (usually unconformably) by Cenomanian to Maastrichtian shallow marine limestones, which form a fairly uniform transgressive succession across most of Afghanistan. (4) A Palaeogene succession rests on the Upper Cretaceous limestones, with a minor break marked by bauxite in places. Thin Palaeocene to Upper Eocene limestones with gypsum are overlain by thin conglomerates, which pass up into shales with a restricted brackish-water ?Upper Oligocene- ?Lower Miocene marine fauna.The Neogene succession consists of a variable thickness of coarse continental sediments derived from the rising Pamir mountains and adjacent ranges. Almost all the deformation of the North Afghan platform began in the Miocene.Oil and gas traps are mainly in Upper Jurassic carbonates and Lower Cretaceous sandstones across the entire North Afghan block. Upper Jurassic carbonate traps, sealed by evaporites, occur mainly north of the southern limit of the Upper Jurassic salt. Lower Cretaceous traps consist of fine-grained continental sandstones, sealed by Aptian-Albian shales and siltstones. Upper Cretaceous-Palaeocene carbonates, sealed by Palaeogene shales are the main traps along the northern edge of the platform and in the Tajik basin.Almost all the traps are broad anticlines related to Neogene wrench faulting, in this respect, like similar traps along the San Andreas fault. Hydrocarbon sources are in the Mesozoic section. The Lower-Middle Jurassic continental coal-bearing beds provide about 75% of the hydrocarbons; the Callovian -Oxfordian provides about 10%; the Neocomian a meagre 1%, and the Aptian-Albian about 14%. The coal-bearing source rocks decrease very markedly in thickness southwards cross the North Afghan platform.Much of the hydrocarbon generation probably occurred during the Late Cretaceous -Paleogene and migrated to structural traps during Neogene deformation.Since no regional structural dip aids southward hydrocarbon migration, and since the traps are all structural and somewhat small, then there is little chance of very large petroleum fields on the platform. Nevertheless, further studies of the North Afghan platform should be rewarding because: (a) the traps of strike-slip belts are difficult to find without detailed exploration; (b) the troubles of the last 20 years mean that almost no exploration has been done; and, (c) conditions may soon become more favorable. There should be ample potential for oil, and particularly gas, discoveries especially in the northern and western parts of the North Afghan platform. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

In a wellbore, high drill string velocities in operational sequences such as tripping might result in surge and swab pressures in the annular section of the wellbore. To overcome these challenges, a controller incorporating safety and actuator limits should be used. A second-order model is used to predict axial drill string velocity downhole. With a NMPC specifying the block position trajectory, choke flow reference, desired backpressure pump flowrate and stand-pipe pressure, we can automatically supervise and control the pressure in the wellbore. To compensate for unmeasured states, an estimator is designed to predict the frictional pressure forces in the wellbore and filter noisy measurements. A stochastic approach for the hydraulic model is taken, including variance of the average fluctuations for the flow and pressure states. Comparing three NMPC configurations, the result of using an integration of the tracking error in the prediction model gave best offset-free tracking of the bottom-hole pressure. The controller compensates for the unknown fluctuations, and is shown to be robust towards model mismatch. Including the mechanical system in the NMPC prediction model, we can effectively constrain the predicted axial drill string velocity to reduce the pressure oscillations and achieve tracking of bottom hole pressure and choke differential pressure. The outcome is shown through extensive simulations to be an effective control strategy, reducing the pressure spikes while tripping.",,,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,,,0332-7353,1890-1328,,,,,,,,,,"Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Mech & Ind Engn, N-7491 Trondheim, Norway",,,,2021-01-05,WOS:000594802000003,,

Texas, South Louisiana, or Qua-Iboe (Nigeria) crude oils were contacted with each of four commercial hardwood biochars and six synthesized biochars in seawater from the Gulf of Mexico and Long Island Sound (U.S.). Synthesized biochars were made from maplewood anoxically at different heat treatment temperatures (HTT) from 300 degrees C to 700 degrees C. Oil absorption capacity of the biochars determined in dip tests using oil on seawater ranged from 3.6 to 6.3 g/g. Oil-imbibed biochar particles were buoyant. Seawater enhanced absorption capacity in relation to the H/C ratio. Oil was less effectively absorbed in the form of weathered water-in-oil microemulsion (chocolate mousse'') than in as-received form. Absorption capacity peaked at HTT about 400 degrees C and correlated poorly with %C, H/C ratio, O/C ratio, surface area, and porosity. It is proposed that swelling, in addition to macropore filling is responsible for the high capacities of biochar. In biometer tests, CO2 evolution from subcapacity levels of Texas crude in biochar suspended in seawater was stimulated relative to oil in the absence of biochar in three tests; whereas, stimulation in a fourth test was not statistically significant. Thus, biochar may prime biodegradation by providing a favorable solid support and an interstitial reservoir of hydrocarbons for degrader biofilms. While less absorptive than many experimental high-tech absorbents, biochar may serve as an inexpensive alternative for recovery of marine oil spills in a form suitable as a fuel or as an aid to natural attenuation.",,,,,,,,,29,3,0,0,17,0,34,,,1092-8758,1557-9018,,,,,,,,,,"Connecticut Agr Expt Stn, Dept Environm Sci, New Haven, CT 06504 USA",,,,2013-07-01,WOS:000321697800005,,

Other bacterial groups comprising members with well-characterized EPS-producing qualities, such as Alteromonas, Colwellia and Pseudoalteromonas, were also found enriched in surface waters, suggesting that the total pool of EPS in the Gulf during the spill may have been supplemented by these organisms. Roller bottle incubations with one of the Halomonas isolates from the Deepwater Horizon spill site demonstrated its ability to effectively produce oil aggregates and emulsify the oil. The enrichment of EPS-producing bacteria during the spill coupled with their capacity to produce amphiphilic EPS is likely to have contributed to the ultimate removal of the oil and to the formation of oil aggregates, which were a dominant feature observed in contaminated surface waters.",,,,,,,,,117,4,0,0,96,1,129,,,1932-6203,,,,,,,,,,,"Univ N Carolina, Gillings Sch Global Publ Hlth, Dept Environm Sci & Engn, Chapel Hill, NC 27515 USAHeriot Watt Univ, Sch Life Sci, Edinburgh, Midlothian, ScotlandUniv Vienna, Fac Sci, Vienna Ecol Ctr, Dept Microbial Ecol, Vienna, AustriaUniv N Carolina, Dept Marine Sci, Chapel Hill, NC USA",,,,2013-06-27,WOS:000321150000096,23826336,

The erosion rates at the oiled islands increased to 275% in the first six months after the oiling, were 200% of that of the unoiled islands for the first 2.5 years after the oiling, and twelve times the average land loss in the deltaic plain of 0.4%y(-1) from 1988 to 2011.

Generally, this process requires the addition alkaline reagents to make a high pH environment. This study developed a novel seawater carbon sequestration technology using a bipolar membrane electrodialysis system with a crystallizer. The results showed the new system had excellent synergistic effects. Water dissociation, CO2 adsorption and precipitation reactions between CO32- and seawater could be carried out in the system without the membrane contamination. With the electric-field, water dissociation occurred on the bipolar membrane and the alkalinity was used to enhance the absorption and ionization of CO2 in the chamber. Based on the ions selective mobility through the anionic membrane, weak base ions combined with seawater in the salt chamber. However, the cations in seawater, calcium and magnesium ions, could not pass through the anionic membrane, which prevented the pollution of the bipolar membrane. Meanwhile, the ion concentrations of CO32- was controlled and primary nucleation of CaCO3 could not occur in the salt chamber. The seeded crystallization in the crystallizer increased the reaction area and consumed the supersaturation degree of CaCO3. This study examined the effects of CO2 access mode of the membrane stack and the induced crystal seeds in the crystallizer on membrane fouling, seawater decalcification, carbon sequestration and energy consumption.

The organic remains from classical antiquity - such as wrought and unwrought woodwork, parts of wooden ship constructions, pieces of leather, remains of different vegetable fruits, etc. - are preserved only when they are not continuously exposed to the effects of sea currents and sea-bed organisms, that is when such material, not long after arriving underwater, was covered in sand or mud or found itself in a closed space such as inside an amphora or some other pot.Numerous organic remains from classical antiquity and earlier periods are found in quay layers, studied in underwater explorations in the coastal area. These quays are recognizable as heaps of stone perpendicular to the coastline and they often close up sections of certain natural bays, transferring them into proper harbours. There is another kind of ports, constructed in relatively sheltered bays where the pier follows the coastline; these are usually built next to a settlement.During cargo transhipment and stay on the operational part of the waterfront certain objects were necessary falling into the sea, not only broken and unusable specimens of the ship's ware, equipment and cargo, but also food remains and other redundant material. In these calmer parts of harbours not so influenced by the action of the waves, mud and sand sedimentation occurred, and deposits of various origins were created on the sea-bottom. During a long-term use, layers in some of these harbour areas, such as the Roman period harbour of Aenona, quays in Pakostane and Bosana near Biograd, became more that 90 cm thick and they contain material deposited for several centuries, as long as the harbour was operative. In deposited layers we find numerous animal bones, shells, fish bones, but also parts of fruits, such as nutshells, almond and hazelnut shells, as well as numerous olive pips and grape, peach, plum, pine nut, etc. seeds. Numerous pieces of wood and burnt splinters also fell into the sea, as well as fashioned parts of ship's equipment, such as pulleys, sections of ropes, pieces of leather, numerous fragments of ceramic and glass vessels, coins, fibulae and parts of golden jewellery, gems, etc. Large number of hooks and pieces of led used for net weights illustrate another activity conducted in these harbour areas, with crew members catching fish with nets and fishhooks during their stay, while the size of certain hooks suggests that the fish were sometimes rather large, scavenging near ships for discarded food.The earliest finds of various fruits were found at the Vranjic peninsula near Split during the protective archaeological research in 2005 and 2006 due to the waterfront expansion. In a prehistoric underwater layer ceramic fragments characteristic of Middle and Late Bronze Age were found, which was confirmed by an additional radiocarbon analysis (1300-900 BC).A careful sieving of the above mentioned prehistoric layer managed to separate out the pips of various products, such as grape (Vitis vinifera) and two species of olive, wild (Olea europaea oleaster Hoffm) and domesticated (Olea europaea sativa Hoffm). Cherry pips were also recognized (Gossipium sp.), as well as blackberry (Rubus sp.) and fig (Ficus carica), but also a fruit that drew our attention because it is very similar to Indian gooseberry (Emblica officinalis Gaertn), a medicinal plant originating in India.Other underwater archaeological research on greater depths, such as that in the Sobra bay on the island of Mljet, provided similar finds. During the exploration of a cargo of North African oil amphorae, a specimen of unusual form was recovered, containing at the moment of shipwreck what were probably salted olives, considering the fact that a number of olive pips was found in it. Two other amphorae accidentally found in two different places also contained pips, probably those of dried figs, and they belong to a well-known type of amphorae produced on Rhodes in the late 1st and early 2nd c. AD. These types of amphorae, because of the size of their mouths, were convenient for this kind of transport, because the content of the amphora was easy to reach by hand. Since the southern coast of Asia Minor and Syria were famous for their figs in the classical antiquity, it was only normal to dry them and use them for food as well as for sale, especially on ships on which it was a practice not to make fire for preparing food during day sailing.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,0350-7165,,,,,,,,,,,"Sveuciliste Zadru, Odjel Arheol, Obala Kralja Petra Kresimira 4 72, HR-23000 Zadar, Croatia",,,,2010-11-01,WOS:000438313200005,,

A direct comparison of the wipe and interception methods was also completed using pigs' trotters as a surrogate for human skin and a direct surface contact exposure scenario. Overall, acceptable recovery and sampling efficiencies were reported for both methods, and both methods had satisfactory storage stability at 1 and 7 days, although there appeared to be some loss over 14 days. The methods' comparison study revealed significantly higher removal of both fluids from the metal surface with the glove samples compared with the wipe samples (on average 2.5 times higher). Both evaluated sampling methods were found to be suitable for assessing dermal exposure to oil-based drilling fluids and crude oil; however, the comparison study clearly illustrates that glove samplers may overestimate the amount of fluid transferred to the skin.

They are primarily introduced into hydrocarbon reservoirs through exchange with formation waters, and can be used to assess migration pathways and mechanisms, as well as reservoir storage conditions. Of particular interest is the role groundwater plays in hydrocarbon transport, which is reflected in hydrocarbon-water volume ratios. Here, we present compositional, stable isotope and noble gas isotope and abundance data from the Sleipner Vest field, in the Norwegian North Sea. Sleipner Vest gases are generated from primary cracking of kerogen and the thermal cracking of oil. Gas was emplaced into the Sleipner Vest from the south and subsequently migrated to the east, filling and spilling into the Sleipner Ost fields. Gases principally consist of hydrocarbons (83-93%), CO2 (5.4-15.3%) and N-2 (0.6-0.9%), as well as trace concentrations of noble gases. Helium isotopes (He-3/He-4) are predominantly radiogenic and range from 0.065 to 0.116 RA; reported relative to air (RA = 1.4 x 10(-6); Clarke et al., 1976; Sano et al., 1988), showing predominantly (> 98%) crustal contributions, consistent with Ne (Ne-20/Ne-22 from 9.70 to 9.91; Ne-21/Ne-22 from 0.0290 to 0.0344) and Ar isotopes (Ar-40/Ar-36 from 315 to 489). Air-derived noble gas isotopes (Ne-20, Ar-36, Kr-84, Xe-132) are introduced into the hydrocarbon system by direct exchange with air-saturated water (ASW). The distribution of air-derived noble gas species are controlled by phase partitioning processes; in that they preferentially partition into the gas (i.e., methane) phase, due to their low solubilities in fluids. Therefore, the extent of exchange between hydrocarbon phases and formation waters - that have previously equilibrated with the atmosphere - can be determined by investigating air-derived noble gas species. We utilize both elemental ratios to address process (i.e., open vs. closed system) and concentrations to quantify the extent of hydrocarbon-water exchange (i.e., volumetric gas-water ratios). These data are discussed within the framework of several conceptual models: (i) total gas-stripping model, which assumes all noble gases have been stripped from the water phase, thus defining the minimum volume of water to have interacted with the hydrocarbon phase; (ii) equilibrium model, which assumes equilibration between groundwater and hydrocarbon phase at reservoir P, T and salinity; and (iii) open and closed system gas-stripping models, using concentrations and elemental ratios. By applying these models to Ne-Ar data from Sleipner, we estimate volumetric gas-water ratios V-g/V-w between 0.02 and 0.07, which are lower than standard geologic gas-water estimates of similar to 0.24, estimated by combining gas-in-place estimates with groundwater porosity estimates. Sleipner Vest data can be best approximated by an open system model, which predicts more than an order of magnitude more groundwater interaction during migration than geologic estimates, indicating a dynamic aquifer system and/or a hydrous migration pathway. In an open system, the extent of gas loss can be estimated to be between 8 and 10 reservoir volumes, which have passed through the system and been lost (i.e., filled and spilled).

Western indigenous leaders representing the Inuit and Saami peoples are actively engaged in the academic and political discourse surrounding climate change, whereas their Russian colleagues tend to focus more on legislation and self-determination, as a post-Soviet legacy. We contribute to the debate with data from the Nenets tundra, showing how different research has employed the three crucial Western research paradigms of climate change, wildlife management and indigenous knowledge on the ground. We suggest that the daily practice of tundra nomadism involves permanent processes of negotiating one's position in a changing environment, which is why adaptation is woven into the society, and cosmology as a whole, rather than being separable into distinct bodies of knowledge or Western-designed categories. We argue that research agendas should be placed in their proper local and regional context, and temporal framework: for example, by collaborating with herders on the topics of weather instead of climate change, herding skills instead of wildlife management, and ways of engaging with the tundra instead of traditional ecological knowledge.",,,,,,,,,71,0,3,0,29,0,80,,,0800-0395,1751-8369,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Lapland, Arctic Ctr, FI-96101 Rovaniemi, FinlandUniv Cambridge, Scott Polar Res Inst, Cambridge CB2 1ER, England",,,,2009-04-01,WOS:000264242100003,,

Numerous studies have examined the causes of contamination, and designs for remediation systems have been developed for contamination from domestic, agricultural, and industrial activities. There is renewed interest in groundwater quality of aquifers from recent activities such as induced saltwater intrusion, hydraulic fracturing, carbon dioxide (CO2) sequestration, and deep geologic storage of nuclear waste. These topics are reviewed and discussed in this paper, focusing on the new challenges resulting from these activities. In this context, modeling flow and transport mechanisms in fractured rocks is relevant, and some recent advances in the field of fracture hydrology are highlighted. More advanced techniques of analysis, namely, fractional advection dispersion equations, are discussed in light of new interest in this topic. It is clear that advances in theory, numerical modeling, and experimentation are needed to address the complex challenges associated with groundwater quality.

A study was thus performed on the design of a floating closed-containment fish farm in sea. This paper presents the design and flow analysis of two versions of the globe; first is the pilot design of a 74 m(3) globe, and the second is the design of a 3500 m(3) globe for post-smolts of Atlantic salmon. The results of turbulence model of the pilot globe were validated against the velocity measurements using acoustic Doppler velocimetry. Computational assessment of various flow charac-teristics includes the velocity and vorticity fields. The streamline pattern confirmed the secondary vortices, creating the tea-cup hydrodynamics. Coherent vortices, identified by means of Q-criterion, show the presence of vortex column in the globe. Two inlet config-urations were tested on the post-smolt globe for improved performance. Design 1 has the Lagrangian particle tracking standard one-column nozzle configuration, and the Design 2 has two-column nozzles to Inlet nozzle angle create a V-shaped inflow. The mixing action of the two designs was examined using Lagrangian particle tracking. Considerable influence of inlet configuration on the particle motion was observed. It was found that V-nozzles (two columns of inlet nozzles) are more effective than standard nozzles in flushing the solid particles. (C) 2018 The Conservation Fund Freshwater Institute.

However, it is facing the dual problems of increasing electricity cost and decreasing energy security. One of the potential contributions to reducing its emission while supplying reliable power is deployment of bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS). BECCS is a carbon removal technology that offers permanent net removal of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere together with the prospect of negative emissions.The present study was undertaken to assess the potential contribution of BECCS to achieving long term decarbonising of the Australian energy sector. This study considers the availability of sustainable bioenergy resources and the economic viability and environmental impacts of BECCS. In order to avoid the ecological uncertainties and social challenges of dedicated energy crops, this study focuses on organic waste from the municipal, agricultural, and forestry sectors. Based on the quantity of biomass resources available, BECCS options in Australia have the potential to remove a total of 25 million tonne CO2/year from the atmosphere as negative emissions by 2050. In addition, BECCS systems could supply Australia with up to 13.7 terawatt-hours of renewable power by mid-century which is around 3.6% of expected gross electricity generation in 2050. Deployment of BECCS as a reliable supplier of electricity would potentially enhance the flexibility and diversity of Australia's energy portfolio and remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.

The victim's buddy, her husband, was accused of her murder and found guilty of manslaughter in an Australian court. A detailed analysis of all the evidence concerning this fatality suggests alternative medical reasons for her death. The value of decompression computers in determining the diving details and of CT scans in clarifying autopsy findings is demonstrated. The victim was medically, physically and psychologically unfit to undertake the fatal dive. She was inexperienced and inadequately supervised. She was over-weighted and exposed for the first time to difficult currents. The analysis of the dive demonstrates how important it is to consider the interaction of all factors and to not make deductions from individual items of information.

Therefore, minor changes in Fs would impact net ecosystem productivity (NEP) and, thus, short- and long-term carbon sequestration. Intensive site management (i.e., site preparation, competition control, fertilization amendments) impacts Fs by influencing resource availability and site productivity. We evaluated the long-term (rotation-age) effects of site preparation and fertilization on F-S and heterotrophic respiration (R-H) in a 33-year-old loblolly pine (Pinus taeda L.) plantation located in the wet flats on the Lower Coastal Plain of Virginia. We utilized an existing long-term study that consisted of a randomized complete block design split by fertilizer treatments that were replicated three times. Each of the three site preparation treatments: (i) chopped, (ii) windrow-bedded and (iii) ditched were split by four fertilizer treatments: (1) no nutrient additions (control), (2) 84 kg P ha(-1) (P), (3) 112 kg N ha(-1) and 84 kg P ha(-1) (NP) and (4) 112 kg N ha(-1), 84 kg P ha(-1), and 2240 kg lime ha(-1) (NPL). Total Soil CO2 efflux and heterotrophic respiration were measured using an infrared gas analyzer with a dynamic closed cuvette chamber. We found decreased Fs (P < 0.05) in bedded and ditching treatments relative to controls 33 years following treatment imposition, and increased Fs (P < 0.05), 24 years later between NPL and P treatments. Our results indicate that silvicultural treatments can exert long lasting impacts on Fs in intensively managed loblolly pine stands. Differences in Fs among treatments were correlated with treatment differences in total stand biomass measured in a previous study. High within-treatment variation in RH masked potential differences in soil microbial biomass and activity for the treatment examined. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

These alarms are ranked in terms of priority and aggregated at each well, platform, field, and asset level, which allows well engineers to easily track down underperforming wells.Alarms priority can be linked either to well integrity issues or production losses. These real-time estimated losses are computed using network and well-modeling softwares; they highlight deviation from optimum operating set points.WPM makes easier regular optimization of gas-lift optimization by feeding models inputs with user-validated real-time data.A major challenge or right-time production optimization is to Sustain updated models. Two workflows address this issue: 1) automatic modeling of production well tests and 2) real-time modeling of the actual behavior of the production system. When a significant difference Occurs between modeling and reality, a specific alarm is triggered.This paper shows various examples of enhanced well performance diagnosis and the corresponding production gains. Also, good support from onsite teams was achieved thanks to key technical solutions, such as user-friendly interface, possible individual timing of each alarm, and handling of unstable or unmatched wells. Finally, WPM enables Computation of KPIs that allow the evaluation of potential well interventions.This tool will be deployed at a corporate level and extended to ESP-lifted wells, gas injectors or producers, and to subsea wells in deep offshore environment.

Explorations off the coast of Brazil are being recognized at an international level, due to both the continuous discovery of new oil fields and the technological experience accumulated throughout the country. Besides the known problems related with drilling in the pre-salt fields, at more than 300 km from the shore and at depths over 2.5 km, there are new challenges related with the transport of oil and gas to shore. In such environments, the pipelines are required to have adequate thermal insulation. However, this must not compromise the oil flow, or complicate the operation and installation procedures.In a different context of funding, a project supported by Petrogal Brasil is being proposed with the goal to develop a new connection systems for sections of pipelines with cementitious annular. The proposal presented wherein is in the scope of this same research and focuses on the development of the cementitious material for this type of solutions. The goal is to develop an optimal cement based material integrating cork for sandwich pipelines to efficiently drain the production from deep water fields distant from the shore. The project will investigate all aspects involved, from material selection and composite development, to the structural and thermodynamic behaviour of pipelines. The thermomechanical properties of the pipeline and the composite, as well as the durability of the composite, will be studied experimentally. Additionally, numerical simulations of the structural behaviour and the heat transfer through and along the pipeline will be performed.The expected result from the project is the optimization of a new flexible cementitious composite integrating cork granulates that ensures good structural and thermal behaviour of sandwich pipelines for the transportation of oil and gas from deep waters. The project will be executed by a consortium with entities with complementary knowledge and resources, namely ITeCons, IST-ID, AISOL and ACC. ITeCons has at its disposal modern facilities and a strong background on numerical modelling, therefore will be responsible for the conception and characterization of the new composite and for modelling the system. IST-ID, with experience in underwater structures will participate in these activities and will be responsible for the structural modelling. AISOL and ACC will participate in defining and characterizing the new composite, given their knowledge and experience in cork composites.

Also the possibility of water reuse or safe discharge was considered. The performance of MBT using medium (MP) and low (LP) pressure lamps was compared as well as operation and maintenance (O&M) cost. Decomposition of organic compounds was followed by means of gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS), total organic carbon (TOC) and chemical oxygen demand (COD) analysis.After filtration step (25 gm) turbidity and concentration of suspended solids decreased by 92% and 80%, respectively. During H2O2/UVC process with LP lamp at optimal conditions (H2O2:TOC ratio 8 and UVC dose received by water 5.28 W-UVC s cm(-2)) removal of phenolic compounds, TOC and COD was 100%, 52.3% and 84.3%, respectively. Complete elimination of phenolic compounds, 47.6% of TOC and 91% of COD was achieved during H2O2/UVC process with MP lamp at optimal conditions (H2O2:TOC ratio 5, UVC dose received by water 6.57 Wuvc s cm 2). In order to compare performance of H2O2/UVC treatment with different experimental set up, the UVC dose required for removal of mg L-1 of COD was suggested as a parameter and successfully applied.The hydrophilicity of H2O2/UVC effluent significantly increased which in turn enhanced the oxidation of organic compounds during CWPO step. After H2O2/UVC treatment with LP and MP lamps residual H2O2 concentration was 160 mg L-1 and 96.5 mg L-1, respectively. Remaining H2O2 was fully consumed during subsequent CWPO step (6 and 3.5 min of contact time for LP and MP, respectively). Total TOC and COD removal after MBT was 94.7% and 92.2% (using LP lamp) and 89.6% and 95%, (using MP lamp), respectively. The O&M cost for MBT with LP lamp was estimated to be 0.44 (sic)m(-3) while with MP lamp it was nearly five times higher. Toxicity assessment was performed using two marine species (Vibrio fischeri and Paracentrotus lividus sea-urchin) after each treatment step. The highest toxicity was attributed to H2O2/UVC effluent for both tested species. After MBT a drastic decrease of toxicity was achieved. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

A better understanding of hydrate-blockage-development behavior can help flow-assurance engineers develop more-economical and environmentally friendly hydrate-management strategies for deepwater operations. In this work, a model is proposed to describe the hydrate-blockage-formation behavior in testing tubing during deep-water-gas-well testing. The reliability of the model is verified with drillstem-testing (DST) data. Case studies are performed with the proposed model. They indicate that hydrates form and deposit on the tubing walls, creating a continuously growing hydrate layer, which narrows the tubing, increases the pressure drop, and finally results in conduit blockage. The hydrate-layer thickness is nonuniform. At some places, the hydrate layer grows more quickly, and this is the high-blockage-risk region (HBRR). The HBRR is not located where the lowest ambient temperature is encountered, but rather at the position where maximum subcooling of the produced gas is presented. As an example case-a deepwater gas well with a water depth of 1565 m and a gas-production rate of 45 x 10(4) m(3)/d-the hydrate blockage first forms at the depth of 150 m. In the section with a depth from 50 to 350 m, hydrates deposit more rapidly and this is the IIBRR. As the water depth increases and/or the gasflow rate decreases, the HBRR becomes deeper. Inhibitors can delay the occurrence of hydrate blockage. The hydrate problems can be handled with a smaller amount of inhibitors during deepwater well-testing operations.

In each simulation, 500 particles were released and were tracked for a real time of 4.0 h. A Monte Carlo approach was used to obtain ensemble properties. It was found that small eddy diffusivities that decrease rapidly with depth generated the largest horizontal spreading of the plume. It was also found that large eddy diffusivities that decrease slowly with depth generated the smallest horizontal spreading coefficient of the plume. The increase in buoyancy resulted in a decrease in the horizontal spreading coefficient, which suggests that two-dimensional (horizontal) models that predict the transport of surface oil could be overestimating the spreading of oil.

These studies reveal a structural architecture common to inverted sedimentary basins the world over, including much younger examples known to be prospective for oil and gas in the North Sea and elsewhere, with which they might be usefully compared. Such comparisons lend themselves to suggestions that the mineral and petroleum systems in Paleo-Mesoproterozoic northern Australia may have spatially, if not temporally overlapped and shared a common tectonic driver, consistent with the observation that basinal sequences hosting Pb-Zn mineralization in northern Australia are bituminous or abnormally enriched in hydrocarbons. Sediment-hosted Pb-Zn mineralization coeval with basin inversion first occurred during the 1650-1640 Ma Riversleigh Tectonic Event towards the close of the Calvert Superbasin with further pulses taking place during and subsequent to the onset of the 1620-1580 Ma Isa Orogeny and final closure of the Isa Superbasin. Mineralization is typically hosted by the post-rift or syn-inversion fraction of basin fill, contrary to existing interpretations of Pb-Zn ore genesis where the ore-forming fluids are introduced during the rifting or syn-extensional phase of basin development. Mineralizing fluids were instead expelled upwards during times of crustal shortening into structural and/or chemical traps developing in the hangingwalls of inverted normal faults. Inverted normal faults predominantly strike NNW and ENE, giving rise to a complex architecture of compartmentalized sub-basins whose individual uplifted basement blocks and doubly plunging periclinal folds exerted a strong control not only on the distribution and preservation of potential trap rocks but the direction of fluid flow, culminating in the colocation and trapping of mineralizing and hydrocarbon fluids in the same carbonaceous rocks. An important case study is the 1575 Ma Century Pb-Zn deposit where the carbonaceous host rocks served as both a reductant and basin seal during the influx of more oxidized mineralizing fluids, forcing the latter to give up their Pb and Zn metal. A transpressive tectonic regime in which basin inversion and mineralization were paired to folding, uplift, and erosion during arc-continent or continent-continent collision, and accompanied by orogen-parallel extensional collapse and strike-slip faulting best accounts for the observed relationships.",,,,,,,,,6,0,0,0,0,0,6,,,1869-9510,1869-9529,,,,,,,,,,"Australian Natl Univ, Res Sch Earth Sci, Canberra, ACT 2601, AustraliaGeol Survey Queensland, Dept Nat Resources Mines & Energy, Brisbane, Qld 4000, Australia",Geol Survey Queensland,,,2020-07-28,WOS:000548502400001,,

The model for oil-dominated systems considers the water phase being dispersed as droplets in an oil continuous layer, and uses either a kinetics or a transport model to calculate hydrate formation at the interface of water droplets. On the other hand, water-dominated systems contain small amounts of oil, and a mass transfer-based hydrate growth model is used. This paper presents a new transient hydrate formation model that predicts hydrate growth and transportability in oil- and water-dominated environments, which might be present simultaneously in oil and gas pipelines due to changes in fluid distribution in complex multiphase flow systems. Simulations of high-pressure pilot-scale flowloop experiments at different water cuts are used to verify this modeling approach. Furthermore, the proposed hydrate simulation tool is applied to analyze the flow dynamics of a subsea tieback involving hydrate formation at varying water cuts after flowloop verification.

Each year, microscopic marine plants remove about as much carbon dioxide from the atmosphere as do land plants. Respiration returns much of this carbon to the ocean as carbon dioxide, but some is locked in the remnants of living organisms. These remaining compounds are modified by pathways that involve bacteria, sunlight, chemical reactions, and other processes that lead to storage of carbon for thousands to millions of years. Some compounds eventually contribute to the petroleum reservoir. Building on previous results, this project will study the reactions and oceanic lifetime of a particular set of biochemicals, called carotenoids, as a possible organic carbon storage pathway. Carotenoids are abundant in very many marine organisms, increasing the likelihood that they are part of this long-term carbon storage and petroleum formation. These compounds also have unique chemical properties that make them subject to specific chemical reactions. For this reason, they have been marketed as powerful antioxidants. Therefore, scientific outcomes from this research on carotenoid chemistry will not only inform ocean carbon cycles but could also benefit studies of their properties as antioxidants. The project will determine the lifetime of carotenoids and their degradation products in seawater to provide new insights into pathways that transfer carbon from the atmosphere through biota and into long-term storage reservoirs. Graduate students and underrepresented undergraduate students will be engaged in the research. Previous work has identified specific chemical backbones of compounds that are broadly distributed within the marine dissolved organic matter (DOM) reservoir. A high-resolution analytical approach that combines nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy with comprehensive gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) has detected DOM compounds with unique structures closely related to carotenoids. Photochemical reactions of a representative carotenoid in laboratory experiments has further linked compounds detected in seawater to carotenoid degradation products (CDP). These preliminary studies show promise that the work funded here will be able to identify specific CDP structures and establish the quantitative significance, lifetimes, and timescales of CDP accumulation in seawater. The project will combine laboratory experiments, high resolution analyses, and chemical synthesis methods to determine the chemical composition of CDP and their abundance in seawater. The novel analytical methods developed through this research will be relevant for other carotenoid-focused studies in petroleum formation, soil chemistry, as well as food chemistry. Ramped pyrolysis oxidation (PyrOx) coupled to radiocarbon measurements will be used to determine the radiocarbon content of CDP-enriched DOM and seek to estimate the accumulation timescale of these dissolved molecules in the environment, and it is hypothesized that deeper, older ocean water will contain a relatively higher proportion of radiocarbon-depleted CDP. Collecting samples from different depths in the North Pacific Ocean where CDP-enriched DOM will be isolated following established sample processing methods will provide insights and new information on the mechanisms that control the amount and timescale of carbon redistribution among Earth?s various reservoirs.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,1736656,,,,,,,,University of California-San Diego Scripps Inst of Oceanography,,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:13553405,,

Efficient use of energy and waste heat recovery and onboard a ship will help the industry meet this target in the meantime. This paper presents the findings from the modelling of a dual fuel marine diesel engine and ORC system cooled by vaporising LNG and simulation using a system engineering software, Siemens Simcenter Amesim 16. Engine manufacturer's design data is used as inputs to run the ORC systems running on two working fluids, n-heptane and n-octane to derive the net work and thermal efficiency when installed on a LNG-fuelled Platform Supply Vessel. The ORC system running on n-heptane is found to provide an annual fuel savings of 7% with an estimated payback period of 2.7 years, making it an attractive option for shipowners.

The Y gas field is at the stage of development. It is necessary to describe the reservoir shape and permeability characteristics in detail to deploy development wells. The seismic prediction effects of tight sandstone are not good. Sedimentary forward modeling technology can effectively predict the macroscopic characteristics of sedimentary sand bodies, but this technique lacks micro-details. Geostatistical modeling can depict reservoir details, but this technique cannot easily reflect macro-laws. Therefore, taking H1 layer of the Oligocene Huagang Formation in the Y gas field as an example, the combination of sedimentary simulation and geostatistical modeling is proposed. Geostatistical modeling is combined to describe reservoir details by using the sequential Gauss simulation method under the control of sedimentary simulation results as macro-laws. First, based on the test data and the sensitivity test results of the adjacent study area, five parameters (transport capacity of the river, sand ratio, maximum initial water depth, lake level change, and tectonic subsidence) needed for the simulation are determined. A sedimentary forward simulation is carried out, and a sand ratio model reflecting macroscopic sedimentary law is obtained. Second, in the geostatistical modeling stage, the variogram which has a great influence on the results of geological modeling is discussed. The results show that the larger the length and width of the variogram, the larger the simulated reservoir scale. Then, considering the characteristics of fewer wells in the study area, a reliable variogram is obtained by using the sand ratio results of the sedimentary simulation (2538 m in length and 876 m in width) and the main input parameters of geological modeling (data probability distribution characteristics and variogram) are determined. Subsequently, under the trend of the sediment sand ratio simulation, geological modeling research was carried out by using the sequential Gauss simulation method, and a high-precision sand ratio prediction model was established. Finally, the sand ratio model is transformed into a sedimentary microfacies model and the permeability characteristics of different sedimentary microfacies are calculated. Under the control of sedimentary facies, the permeability model is established by the sequential Gauss simulation method. The model prediction results show that the simulation results can reflect the morphology, distribution and permeability of sedimentary microfacies in detail and the macroscopic characteristics of delta sedimentary law. The permeability of channels in the study area is 0.3 md, and the distribution area is much larger than that of other types of sedimentary microfacies. Compared with other types of deposits, the channel around well A area has better development potential in the front of the delta and is the most favorable oil and gas development area in the study area.",,,,,,,,,9,0,0,0,0,0,9,,,0264-8172,1873-4073,,,,,,,,,,"Yangtze Univ, Wuhan 430100, Hubei, Peoples R ChinaPetroChina Explorat & Dev Res Inst, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China",,,,2020-02-07,WOS:000509622600061,,

The Compact Flotation Unit (CFU) is a promising technique for removing oil and suspended solids from produced water due to many attractive features such as high separation efficiency, short hydraulic residence time (HRT), and small footprint. In this article, the Machine Learning method (GA-BP neural network model) is used to learn, train, feedback, and predict the correlation between structural parameters and separation characteristics, thus realizing the structural optimization and performance improvement of the device. Mean squared error of GA-BP neural network model is 0.009, and the maximum squared error is 0.028. Separation efficiency of the CFU after optimization can reach up to 92.82%, that is, an improvement of 13.6%. The effects of inlet flow rate, split ratio, and inlet oil content on separation performance of CFU have been predicted. It is showed that when the inlet flow rate increases from 2 m(3)/h to 6 m(3)/h, the separation efficiency of CFU decreases greatly. As the split ratio rises from 1% to 8%, the separation efficiency has increased from 89.2% to 95.0%. The rise of split ratio means the increases of hydraulic loading rate in the water clarification zone, which is beneficial to the floating up of oil droplets, thus leading to the improvement of separation efficiency. Increase of inlet oil content is advantageous to promote the collision and coalescence of oil droplets and leads to the improvement of oil-water separation efficiency. Generally speaking, this method can quickly and accurately obtain the influence of structure parameters on separation characteristics, which is helpful to optimize the flow field distribution and improve the performance of related environmental protection equipment, as well as minimize the R&D costs and shorten the R&D cycle.",,,,,,,,,8,0,0,0,1,0,8,,,1092-8758,1557-9018,,,,,,,,,,"Beijing Inst Petrochem Technol, Sch Mech Engn, Beijing 102617, Peoples R ChinaBeijing Key Lab Pipeline Crit Technol & Equipment, Beijing, Peoples R China",Beijing Key Lab Pipeline Crit Technol & Equipment,,,2019-10-04,WOS:000486206800022,,

Here, we describe the long-term fire regime in two forests on the south coast of British Columbia by means of 244 AMS radiocarbon dates of charcoal buried in forest soils. In both forests, some sites have experienced no fire over the last 6000 years and many other sites have experienced only one or two fires during that time. Intervals between fires vary from a few centuries to several thousand years. In contrast to other conifer forests, this supports a model of forest dynamics where fires are of minor ecological importance. Instead, forest history is dominated by fine-scale processes of disturbance and recovery that maintain an ubiquitous late-successional character over the forest landscape.

Based on spatial, chemical, oceanographic, and mass balance considerations, we calculate that this contamination represents 4-31% of the oil sequestered in the deep ocean. The pattern of contamination points to deep-ocean intrusion layers as the source and is most consistent with dual modes of deposition: a bathtub ring formed from an oil-rich layer of water impinging laterally upon the continental slope (at a depth of similar to 900-1,300 m) and a higher-flux fallout plume where suspended oil particles sank to underlying sediment (at a depth of similar to 1,300-1,700 m).

Our study identified a two-layer hydraulic structure in the beach, a high-permeability upper layer and a low-permeability layer at the bottom. Numerical simulations indicated that the density gradient between the saltwater and freshwater strongly affects solute transport in the intertidal zone of the beach. A sensitivity study indicated that depth to and slope of the bedrock had major effects on solute transport in the lower layer, but minor effects in the upper layer. A deep bedrock caused the water particles travelling in the lower layer to penetrate deeper in the beach.

Soil reservoirs of Fe and P in bulk horizons and in narrower depth increments were characterized using sequential chemical extractions and synchrotron-based X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS). Organic horizons across all polygon features (e.g., trough, ridge, and center) were enriched in extractable Fe and P relative to mineral horizons. Soil Fe was dominated by organic-bound Fe and short-range ordered Fe oxyhydroxides, while soil P was primarily associated with oxides and organic matter in organic horizons but apatite and/or calcareous minerals in mineral horizons. Iron oxyhydroxides and Fe-bound inorganic P (P-i) were most enriched at the soil surface and decreased gradually with depth, and Fe-bound P(i)was >4x greater than water-soluble P-i.

This relationship is determined mainly by intrinsic parameters of the Earth system-namely, the ocean carbon buffer capacity, the radiative forcing of carbon dioxide and the carbon inventory of the ocean. We use this relationship to reveal the effect of changes in ocean circulation from carbon dioxide forcing on patterns of ocean warming in both observations and global Earth system models from the Fifth Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5). We show that historical patterns of ocean warming are shaped by ocean heat redistribution, which CMIP5 models simulate poorly. However, we find that projected patterns of heat storage are primarily dictated by the pre-industrial ocean circulation (and small changes in unresolved ocean processes)-that is, by the patterns of added heat owing to ocean uptake of excess atmospheric heat rather than ocean warming by circulation changes. Climate models show more skill in simulating ocean heat storage by the pre-industrial circulation compared to heat redistribution, indicating that warming patterns of the ocean may become more predictable as the climate warms.A linear relationship between the storage of heat and carbon in global oceans in response to anthropogenic emissions is used to reconstruct the effect of circulation changes on past and future ocean warming patterns.",,,,,,,,,58,2,0,0,8,0,63,,,0028-0836,1476-4687,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Oxford, Atmospher Ocean & Planetary Phys, Oxford, EnglandGeophys Fluid Dynam Lab, Princeton, NJ 08540 USAUniv Arizona, Dept Geosci, Tucson, AZ 85721 USAPrinceton Univ, Program Atmospher & Ocean Sci, Princeton, NJ 08544 USANYU, Courant Inst Math Sci, New York, NY USA",,,,2020-08-13,WOS:000559831500014,32788734,

The objective of this work is to simulate the oil spill trajectory of oil released from a pipeline leaking in the Gulf of Mexico with the GNOME (General NOAA Operational Modeling Environment) model. The model was developed by NOAA (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration) to investigate the effects of different pollutants and environmental conditions on trajectory results. Also, a Texture-Classifying Neural Network Algorithm (TCNNA) was used to delineate ocean oil slicks from synthetic aperture radar (SAR) observations. During the simulation, ocean currents from NCOM (Navy Coastal Ocean Model) outputs and surface wind data measured by an NDBC (National Data Buoy Center) buoy are used to drive the GNOME model. The results show good agreement between the simulated trajectory of the oil spill and synchronous observations from the European ENVI-SAT ASAR (Advanced Synthetic Aperture Radar) and the Japanese ALOS (Advanced Land Observing Satellite) PALSAR (Phased Array L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar) images. Based on experience with past marine oil spills, about 63.0% of the oil will float and 18.5% of the oil will evaporate and disperse. In addition, the effects from uncertainty of ocean currents and the diffusion coefficient on the trajectory results are also studied. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

However, climate change is predicted to bring not only changes in abiotic conditions but also the replacement of peat-forming vegetation, such as Sphagnum mosses, with vascular plants. In these systems, enchytraeid worms represent the dominant mesofaunal group, and previous climate change manipulations have shown that their abundances and vertical distribution are strongly influenced by temperature and moisture gradients, with important implications for C cycling. Therefore, determining their behavioural responses to changes in both abiotic and biotic factors is crucial to quantify their contribution to decomposition processes.We investigated the importance of vertical edaphic gradients (soil moisture and labile C) on enchytraeids total numbers, vertical distribution and feeding activities by inverting intact soil cores and hence, reversing both substrate quality but leaving the microclimatic gradients intact. This manipulative experiment was set up in two different peatland areas, one dominated by heather (Erica mackaiana) and another by mosses (Sphagnum sp.) to determine the influence of different plant functional growth forms on these responses.Our results showed that most enchytraeid species were 'stayers' (i.e. in the 'Upturned cores', they remained in the same layer where they are 'Normally' located), and hence, their vertical distribution was more dependent on substrate quality than a change in microclimate. This response was more evident under drier conditions (i.e. the highest locations of the height gradient at the heather site) than at the wettest locations (i.e. the bottom of the slope and under mosses) due to more pronounced vertical gradients in substrate quality. Furthermore, radiocarbon measurements on enchytraeid tissues showed that to avoid competition among the growing populations for the limited labile resources present in the top layers, enchytraeids selected older C sources.These findings indicate that future climate change scenarios will not only bring important changes in the abiotic conditions (temperature and moisture) and biotic properties of peatlands (both vegetation composition and below-ground soil biota community structure and vertical distribution) but also alterations in the feeding preferences of key decomposers that could result in the mobilization of previously unavailable C pools.A free Plain Language Summary can be found within the Supporting Information of this article.",,,,,,,,,3,0,0,0,2,0,3,,,0269-8463,1365-2435,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Vigo, Fac Biol, Dept Ecol & Biol Anim, Vigo, SpainChina Acad Journal CD Elect Journals Publishing H, Beijing, Peoples R ChinaUniv Vigo, Dept Biol Vegetal & Ciencias Suelo, Vigo, SpainUniv A Coruna, Ctr Invest Cient Avanzadas, La Coruna, SpainNERC Radiocarbon Facil, Glasgow, Lanark, Scotland",China Acad Journal CD Elect Journals Publishing H,,,2020-03-03,WOS:000514388700001,,

One potential effect of increased human development is increased anthropogenic waste and the need to dispose of this waste in landfills. We investigated potential indirect effects of the North Slope Borough landfill on breeding shorebirds by examining changes in environmental conditions (predator densities and timing of snow melt) and measures of shorebird reproduction (nest-initiation dates, nest density, nest survival, and return rates) in relation to construction and deposition of waste in the landfill. This study included one year of pre-construction data (2004), three years when landfill roads and fences were being constructed (2005-2007), and five years when waste was being deposited (2008-2012). We monitored 364 shorebird nests within a 36-ha plot (approximately half of which was inside the landfill and half outside). Construction of a fence around the landfill reduced snow levels inside the landfill, leading to earlier snow melt and likely to shorebirds initiating nests earlier. Densities of avian predators increased following waste deposition, but nest densities, nest survival, and return rates were generally greater inside the landfill than outside in all years after landfill construction. Our results indicate that fences placed around landfills and procedures to reduce attraction of predators to landfills can minimize indirect negative effects of landfill construction and operation and even favor species breeding in the area.",,,,,,,,,7,0,0,0,6,0,8,,,,1938-5129,,,,,,,,,,"Manomet Ctr Conservat Sci, Manomet, MA 02345 USAUS Fish & Wildlife Serv, Migratory Bird Management Div, Anchorage, AK 99503 USA",Manomet Ctr Conservat Sci,,,2014-01-08,WOS:000328295800013,,

This observation raises several challenges for the asset integrity and life extension of all offshore units. Therefore, for the ageing FPSOs (>10 years), frequent and costly structural maintenance operations in hazardous environment may be required to repair their hull. While a standard ship can go to dry-dock for crop and renew maintenance operations through standard hot works techniques, a permanently moored asset has to be maintained in situ. The challenge is to perform these offshore structural maintenance operations with no production disruption while maximizing safety even for the most stressed areas such as a mid-ship deck plating.COLDSHIELD, a co-development between COLD PAD, TOTAL and IFP Energies nouvelles, has been set up to meet this very challenge. This innovative alternative to crop and renew is covered by approval certificate from Class. COLDSHIELD stops the corrosion and restores hull structural strength. Two industrial applications have been performed so far. Among the steps to be taken to demonstrate that such repair can be considered as permanent, it was mandatory to characterize the fatigue behavior of this reinforcement solution.While the fatigue behavior of steel has been an important research topic since the early eighties of the last century, its understanding for bonded composite materials is still at its infancy. Indeed, for the time being there is to our knowledge no S-N curve for structural bonded reinforcements. Full scale coupon specimen fatigue tests of the structural bonded reinforcements were conducted by COLD PAD, third-partied by Bureau Veritas and in collaboration with two laboratories (private and public) in order to study the adhesive fatigue. A statistical analysis was performed according to international standards. The resulting S-N curve is fit for industrial fatigue design. It demonstrates a comfortable fatigue strength (S-N curve presenting a slope of 9).This paper presents the results of a fatigue life assessment campaign of COLDSHIELD including the experimental setup, the fatigue test results, and the numerical analyses. It details the reason why the design is compatible with a stress-based approach. It also explains the conclusions that can be derived in terms of fatigue life for a deck repair campaign.",,,,,"38th ASME International Conference on Ocean, Offshore and Arctic Engineering (OMAE 2019)38th ASME International Conference on Ocean, Offshore and Arctic Engineering (OMAE 2019)","JUN 09-14, 2019JUN 09-14, 2019","ASME, Ocean Offshore & Arctic Engn Div; Univ Strathclyde, Dept Naval Architecture Ocean & Marine EngnASME, Ocean Offshore & Arctic Engn Div; Univ Strathclyde, Dept Naval Architecture Ocean & Marine Engn","Univ Strathclyde, Glasgow, SCOTLANDUniv Strathclyde, Glasgow, SCOTLAND",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,2153-4772,,978-0-7918-5879-0,,,,,,,,,"COLD PAD, Paris, FranceBur Veritas Marine & Offshore, Composite Mat Sect, Expertise Dept DE, Nantes, FranceCOLD PAD, Lead Expt & Numer Simulat, Paris, FranceBur Veritas Marine & Offshore, Struct Sect, Res Dept, La Def, France",COLD PADBur Veritas Marine & OffshoreCOLD PADBur Veritas Marine & Offshore,,,2020-03-06,WOS:000513099800046,,

In order to fulfill these requirements, turbine inlet temperature and pressure ratio are not increased up to the optimal values and one or more redundant gas turbines may be employed. With increasing incentives for reducing the CO2 emissions off-shore, improving the thermal efficiency has become a focus area. Due to the peculiar low turbine outlet temperature and due to space and weight constraints, a steam bottoming cycle is not a convenient solution. On the contrary, organic Rankine cycles (ORCs) present the benefits of high simplicity and compactness. Furthermore, the working fluid can be selected considering the temperature profile at which the heat is supplied; hence the heat transfer process and the thermal efficiency of the cycle can be maximized. This paper is aimed at finding the most optimal ORC tailored for off-shore applications using an optimization procedure based on the genetic algorithm. Numerous working fluids are screened through, considering mainly thermal efficiency, but also other characteristics of the fluids, e.g. stability, environmental and human health impacts, and safety issues. Both supercritical and subcritical ORCs are included in the analysis. The optimization procedure is first applied to a conservative ORC where the maximum pressure is limited to 20 bar. Subsequently the optimal working fluid is identified by removing the restriction on the maximum pressure. Different limits on hazards and global warming potential (GWP) are also set. The study is focused on the SGT-500 gas turbine installed on the Draugen platfoim in the Norwegian Sea. The simulations suggest that, when a high hazard is accepted, cyclohexane is the best solution. With a turbine inlet pressure limit of 20 bar, the combined gas turbine-ORC system presents an efficiency of 43.7%, corresponding to an improvement of 11.9%-points with respect to the gas turbine efficiency. With no upper pressure boundary, cyclohexane at 55.5 bar is the preferable working fluid with a combined thermal efficiency of 44.3%. The supercritical CO2 cycle with a maximum pressure of 192.9 bar is found to be the best alternative if an extremely low hazard is required.",,,,,ASME Turbo Expo: Turbine Technical Conference and ExpositionASME Turbo Expo: Turbine Technical Conference and Exposition,"JUN 03-07, 2013JUN 03-07, 2013",Int Gas Turbine InstInt Gas Turbine Inst,"San Antonio, TXSan Antonio, TX",6,0,0,0,0,0,6,,,,,978-0-7918-5520-1,,,,,,,,,"Tech Univ Denmark, Dept Mech Engn, Lyngby, Denmark",,,,2013-01-01,WOS:000361500300004,,

CO2 capture is premised on the safe long-term storage Of CO2 in geological formations. Naturally occurring CO2 is used for enhanced oil recovery in the USA, Trinidad, Turkey, Hungary, Brazil and Croatia. Industrially produced CO2 has been used for enhanced oil recovery at the Rangely field in Colorado, USA since 1986 and at the Weyburn field in Saskatchewan, Canada since 2000. Large-scale CO2 storage in geological formations to avoid CO2 emissions was first undertaken offshore in Norway in 1996 and onshore in Algeria in 2004. CO2 delivered for EOR in the USA averaged around USD 11/tonne CO2 during the 1990s. The Cost Of CO2 capture from low concentration industrial sources varies with a number of factors, but will certainly be very much higher than the recovery of naturally-occurring CO2. Adequate knowledge exists in the oil and gas industry for the application Of CO2 capture and storage. Widespread implementation of fully-integrated CO2 value chains will nonetheless depend on achieving public acceptance and regulatory approval for CO2 storage, cost reduction for CO2 capture and sufficient economic incentives for the key actors involved. This article discusses the most important research directions for CO2 capture and storage projects that have been initiated around the world. The adequacy of economic incentives will strongly influence how quickly producers and users of fossil fuels are able to close the knowing-doing gap for CO2 capture and storage.",,,,,,,,,292,16,0,0,27,3,328,,,0263-8762,1744-3563,,,,,,,,,,"Statoil ASA, Res & Technol Dev, N-7005 Rotvoll, Norway",,,,2006-09-01,WOS:000240934700002,,

Spectral feature analysis compared the AVIRIS data to reference spectra of oiled marsh by using absorption features centered near 1.7 and 23 mu m, which arise from C-H bonds in oil. AVIRIS-derived maps of oiled shorelines from the individual dates of July 31, September 14, and October 4, 2010, were 89.3%, 89.8%, and 90.6% accurate, respectively. A composite map at 3.5 m grid spacing, accumulated from the three dates, was 93.4% accurate in detecting oiled shorelines. The composite map had 100% accuracy for detecting damaged plant canopy in oiled areas that extended more than 1.2 m into the marsh. Spatial resampling of the AVIRIS data to 30 m reduced the accuracy to 73.6% overall. However, detection accuracy remained high for oiled canopies that extended more than 4 m into the marsh (23 of 28 field reference points with oil were detected). Spectral resampling of the 3.5 m AVIRIS data to Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapper (ETM) spectral response greatly reduced the detection of oil spectral signatures. With spatial resampling of simulated Landsat ETM data to 30 m, oil signatures were not detected. Overall, similar to 40 km of coastline, marsh comprised mainly of Spartina alterniflora and Juncus roemerianus, were found to be oiled in narrow zones at the shorelines. Zones of oiled canopies reached on average 11 m into the marsh, with a maximum reach of 21 m. The field and airborne data showed that, in many areas, weathered oil persisted in the marsh from the first field survey. July 10, to the latest airborne survey. October 4, 2010.

In deep water plumes, these communities were initially dominated by members of Oceanospirillales, Colwellia, and Cycloclasticus. None of these groups were abundant in surface oil slick samples, and Colwellia was much more abundant in oil- degrading enrichment cultures incubated at 4 degrees C than at room temperature, suggesting that the colder temperatures at plume depth favored the development of these communities. These groups decreased in abundance after the well was capped in July, but the addition of hydrocarbons in laboratory incubations of deep waters from the Gulf of Mexico stimulated Colwellia's growth. Colwellia was the primary organism that incorporated C-13 from ethane and propane in stable isotope probing experiments, and given its abundance in environmental samples at the time that ethane and propane oxidation rates were high, it is likely that Colwellia was active in ethane and propane oxidation in situ. Colwellia also incorporated C-13 benzene, and Colwellia's abundance in crude oil enrichments without natural gas suggests that it has the ability to consume a wide range of hydrocarbon compounds or their degradation products. However, the fact that ethane and propane alone were capable of stimulating the growth of Colwellia, and to a lesser extent, Oceanospirillales, suggests that high natural gas content of this spill may have provided an advantage to these organisms.",,,,,,,,,271,0,0,0,226,0,300,,,0027-8424,1091-6490,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Dept Earth Sci, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USAUniv Calif Santa Barbara, Inst Marine Sci, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA",,,,2012-12-11,WOS:000312605600038,21969552,

On the Atlantic seaboard of the Iberian Peninsula a great swath of tidal wetlands, which correspond to semi-confined estuaries, represents land reclaimed from the 18th century to the first half of the 20th century and used for urban development or agricultural production. These interventions led to the end of tidal flooding in extensive areas of salt marshes, Causing a drop in the water table that triggered pyrite oxidization processes, leaching of cations and salts and soil acidification. In many cases, these transformations have given rise to environmental problems such as the development of acid sulphate soils, a resulting decrease in pH, and the leaching of carbonates. The organic carbon storage capacity has also been altered, and the release of metal cations from sediments has caused toxic waters to appear.In order to investigate the alterations caused by the historic reclamation of estuarine soils on the north coast of Spain, natural and reclaimed lands were mapped in two estuaries (Villaviciosa and San Vicente de la Barquera) and zoned in accordance with flood frequency.The different evolutionary paths of the two studied estuarine sites after reclamation can be assessed through the description and analysis of their soils despite reclamation, some parts (i.e. lower areas) of the reclaimed lands do not remain fully isolated from tidal dynamics, whose influence varies throughout the soil profiles that have developed since. The strength of the morphological (e.g. genetic horizons). chemical (pH, metal cation concentration) and functional (balance of the carbon budget) changes suffered by the original soils seem to depend strongly on the remaining tidal influence as well as the land use of the area.

It was designated the LM6000, and was first introduced as the -PA model in December 1992. This turbine used a single annular combustion system with relatively few changes from the successful aircraft engine - the CF680-C2. At the same time, GE began development of Dry Low Emissions (DLE) combustion technologies, culminating in the LM6000-PB model being introduced in December 1994. As the LM6000 fleet approached the I million-hour point, with an installed base of over 100 units, the next step - the development of a turbine with greater power and efficiency - was initiated, creating the LM6000-PC and -PD models. The launch of GE's LM6000-PC/PD aero-derivative gas turbine was announced in 1996 and the first unit went into commercial operation in a power generation application in late 1997. The mechanical drive version of this gas turbine has been available as a product since early 1998. This machine opens an entirely new market segment, with interest being paced by the development of this segment requiring variable speed drivers with outputs greater than 50,000 shaft horsepower. Although some exploratory interest for mechanical drive applications was generated when the product was first announced, significantly greater interest within both gas pumping, and marine applications has been expressed recently especially considering changes in the global environmental regulations, energy prices, larger ships moving at greater speeds. Typical applications are new designs of large oil and gas production facilities for gas pumping, processing, and natural gas liquefaction, as well as large marine and naval applications requiring high power-weight densities. GE is currently supporting several ongoing application studies using the LM6000 gas turbine as the driver of choice. This document provides the highlights of the development, testing and qualification of the LM6000 by General Electric as well as the certification program by the American Bureau of Shipping (ABS). Notable engineering accomplishments during this development include part power NOX abatement, auto-throttles, and cubic loading using a generator.",,,,,51st ASME Turbo Expo51st ASME Turbo Expo,"MAY 06-11, 2006MAY 06-11, 2006",Amer Soc Mech Engineers; Int Gas Turbine InstAmer Soc Mech Engineers; Int Gas Turbine Inst,"Barcelona, SPAINBarcelona, SPAIN",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,0-7918-4240-1,,,,,,,,,"GE Marine, Cincinnati, OH USA",GE Marine,,,2006-01-01,WOS:000242368000006,,

This infrastructure supports information collection from distributed heterogeneous databases, integration with enterprise legacy software systems, logistics planning, and monitoring of contingency situation in open, dynamic agent environment. The approach is applied for the development of the CMS for the oil complexes in the marine zone of the gulf of Campeche. One of the key components of the CMS, an evacuation logistics planning system is described to illustrate the approach. A method of coalition formation is used for logistics planning in a multi-agent environment. Distributed and centralized algorithms for coalition formation are described and compared. The latter algorithm is based on the cooperative game theoretic model with fuzzy coalitions. In both algorithms, agents use fuzzy rules of Mamdani type for decision making.

Low salinity water injections is a well-established and proved technique for water flooding application in sandstone rocks to enhance the recovery efficiency; where the water salinity is adapted to a certain degree to extract the highest amount of oil from a reservoir. Reserve-estimation statistics show the significance of oil reserves in carbonate reservoirs, hence this work deals with the carbonate rocks where water flooding may fail due to many reasons, and the most common one is fractures existence in the carbonate rocks. This work applied the water injection for six carbonate (limestone) core samples from Belayim Formation of Middle Miocene age that extracted from an Egyptian offshore oil field in the Gulf of Suez. This carbonate facies is hard, vuggy, fragmented, dolomitic, and highly saturated with oil and considered a good reservoir. Relative permeability test was carried out to investigate the reservoir response in terms of recovery efficiency hence residual oil saturation, when flooding the reservoir with waters having different salinity ratios. Results showed an increase in recovery efficiency for all the tested samples, on applying the low salinity water injection, where all the relative permeability curves displayed wettability modification/alteration toward water wetness properties.",,,,,,,,,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,,,0379-5136,0975-1033,,,,,,,,,,"EPRI, Prod Dept, Cairo, EgyptEPRI, Explorat Dept, Cairo, EgyptPetrosilah Petr Co, Cairo, Egypt",Petrosilah Petr Co,,,2019-12-06,WOS:000498610500004,,

These results highlight that although community attachment is essential for community resilience, it can also be disruptive to individual well-being when technological disasters occur in communities dependent on renewable and natural resources.",,,,,,,,,71,0,0,0,7,0,89,,,0002-7642,1552-3381,,,,,,,,,,"Louisiana State Univ, Off Res & Econ Dev, Baton Rouge, LA 70803 USA",,,,2012-01-01,WOS:000300574800002,,

This study aimed to assess the addition of two low-cost plant residues, sugarcane bagasse (SCB) and leaf litter (LL) of the forest leguminous Mimosa caesalpiniifolia plant (sabia), either separately or combined, to a contaminated soil from a petroleum refinery area, analyzed after 90 days of treatment. Individually, both amounts of SCB (20 and 40 g kg(-1)) favored the growth of total heterotrophic bacteria and total fungi, while LL at 20 g kg(-1) better stimulated the hydrocarbon-degrading microorganism's activity in the soil. However, no TPH removal was observed under any of these conditions. Higher microbial growth was detected by the application of both plant residues in multicontaminated soil. The maximum TPH removal of 30% was achieved in amended soil with 20 g kg(-1) SCB and 20 kg(-1) LL. All the experimental conditions revealed changes in the microbial community structure, related to the handling of the soil, with abundance of Alphaproteobacteria. This study demonstrates the effectiveness of the plant residues SCB and LL as low-cost nutritional materials for biodegradation of hydrocarbon in real oil contaminated soil by indigenous populations.",,,,,,,,,3,0,0,0,2,0,3,,,1093-4529,1532-4117,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Fed Rio de Janeiro, Ctr Tecnol, Sch Chem, Bloco E, Rio De Janeiro, BrazilState Univ North Fluminense, Ctr Agr Sci & Technol, Soil Lab, Rio De Janeiro, BrazilUniv Sao Paulo, Luiz de Queiroz Coll Agr, Dept Soil Sci, Piracicaba, SP, BrazilEmbrapa Environm, Lab Environm Microbiol, Jaguari una, SP, BrazilMCTIC Minist Sci Technol Innovat & Commun, CETEM, Ctr Mineral Technol, Av Pedro Calmon 900, BR-21941908 Rio De Janeiro, RJ, Brazil",State Univ North FluminenseMCTIC Minist Sci Technol Innovat & Commun,,,2020-03-04,WOS:000514730900001,32067565,

Economic theory dictates that the oil damage and restitution payments that resulted from the spill should be capitalized into property values. To measure the extent of this capitalization, we create a novel dataset by linking surveys of the location and severity of oil observed along over 4,300 miles of the Gulf Coast to measures of local housing market outcomes. We then perform hedonic-style analysis to determine the net effects of the spill on affected real estate markets. In doing so, we provide the first plausibly causal estimates of the effect of the spill on affected housing markets throughout the Gulf region. Identification comes from a triple difference framework that exploits the random nature of both the spill and the spatial distribution of oil that affected coastal communities, as well as controls for the confounding effects of the housing market crash. Results suggest that on net, the BP oil spill caused a significant decline in home prices of between 4% and 8% that persisted until at least 2015. This implies housing markets capitalized $3.8 billion to $5.0 billion in spill damage inclusive of clean-up and restitution effects.

So far, studies on ICI variation are mostly descriptive and the behavioural context in which certain click train patterns are emitted is poorly understood.In this study, the behaviour of free-ranging porpoises was quantified by using typical ICI patterns known from the literature. These were recorded using two T-PODs deployed at a wind farm site (Nysted, Denmark) between 14 June and 12 July 2005 and during the entanglement of a porpoise calf in a gillnet (Clayoquot Sound Canada). It was possible to distinguish between feeding, approach behaviour and communication and known ICI patterns associated with these behaviours were used to categorise acoustic data.During feeding typical click trains start with long ICIs (30-70ms) and end with ICIs down to about 2ms. In a transition phase ICIs rapidly decrease. Click trains attribtued to feeding were found in the wind farm data at a rate of 6.3d (1) (n=174) with a patchy distribution. We found 20 to 74s long click train sequences with ICIs gradually decreasing from a median of 72ms (range 34 to 143ms) down to 5ms at a rate of 1.6day (1) (n=45). This was interpreted as approach behaviour, in which the animal was acoustically 'locked on' to a reflective structure. Communication signals are built up of click trains with very short ICIs (<7.7ms). during the entanglement of a porpoise calf, three different call types were determined at a rate of 8.9min(-1) (n=89). One call with variable duration (100 to 890ms) and relatively stable ICIs as low as 3.6ms resembled 'distress calls' described by Amundin (1991b). Another call type with durations from 780 to 830ms and ICIs ranging from 3.0 to 10 ms and thus different with respect to ICI curve progression was found only three times. These had a U-shaped ICI curve, similar to an 'alarm' or 'fright' call described by Busnel and Dziedzic (1966). A third and previously unreporeted call is characterised by a long call duration (up to 1.270ms) and sometimes oscillating ICIs with an initial decrease from about 9ms to around 7ms and an increase towards the end.The data presented suggest that the T-POD is a promising tool for behavioural studies. It is possible to recognise certain acoustic behavioural categories described in the literature, but it is important to look at the temporal context with other vocalisations in T-POD data, such as ICIs of preceding click trains.",,,,,,,,,23,0,0,0,19,0,23,,,1561-0713,,,,,,,,,,,"Kuhlandweg 12, D-24326 Nehmten, Germany",,,,2008-09-01,BCI:BCI200900330867,,

Photosynthetic O-2 evolution generally was inhibited at low water potentials (Psi(W)) but more in sunflower leaves than in Fucus fronds at the same Psi(W). As Psi(W) decreased, less carbon accumulated in an organic carbon store in Fucus. The inhibition of photosynthesis appeared to be mostly biochemical because it could not be prevented by supplying additional CO2 or by supplying CO2 from the internal organic carbon store. The inhibition of photosynthesis and carbon storage occurred after turgor disappeared and thus when solute concentrations were increasing in the cells. Solute concentrations were much higher in Fucus than in sunflower. After desiccation to the air-dry state (Psi(W) below -10 MPa), photosynthesis could not recover in sunflower but it recovered rapidly when Fucus was exposed to seawater. The lack of recovery in sunflower was associated with inability to recover turgor probably because of breaks in cell membranes. The ability to recover in Fucus was gradually lost during 1.5 d of desiccation at 45% relative humidity. At lower humidities, recovery was lost sooner as small amounts of water were removed. We conclude that photosynthesis tolerated desiccation more in Fucus than in sunflower because of differences in the molecular environment around the photosynthetic enzymes. Important aspects of this environment were features that prevented membrane breakage but promoted the retention of small amounts of water that were critical for viability.",,,,,,,,,36,11,0,0,30,0,51,,,0032-0781,,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Delaware, Coll Marine Studies, Lewes, DE 19958 USAUniv Delaware, Coll Agr & Nat Resources, Lewes, DE 19958 USA",,,,2000-03-01,WOS:000086051400012,10805598,

The natural methane productivity (dry weight per hectare) of seaweeds is greater than in many terrestrial plant systems. As part of their defence systems, seaweeds, unlike terrestrial plants, produce a range of halogenated secondary metabolites, especially chlorinated and brominated compounds. Some orders of brown seaweeds also accumulate iodine, up to 1.2% of their dry weight. Fluorine remains rather unusual within the chemical structure. Halogenated hydrocarbons have moderate to high toxicities. In addition, halogenated organic compounds constitute a large group of environmental chemicals due to their extensive use in industry and agriculture. In recent years, concerns over the environmental fate and release of these halogenated organic compounds have resulted in research into their biodegradation and the evidence emerging shows that many of these compounds are more easily degraded under strictly anaerobic conditions compared to aerobic biodegradation. Biosorption via seaweed has become an alternative to the existing technologies in removing these pollutants. Halogenated compounds are known inhibitors of methane production from ruminants and humanmade anaerobic digesters. The focus of this paper is reviewing the available information on the effects of halogenated organic compounds on anaerobic digestion.",,,,,,,,,10,0,0,0,5,0,10,,,,2311-5637,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Greenwich, Algae Biotechnol Res Grp, Fac Engn & Sci, Chatham ME4 4TB, Kent, England",,,,2020-09-01,WOS:000579655100001,,

Reflectance transformation imaging (RTI) has a proven track record in terrestrial contexts for acquiring high resolution diagnostic data at small scales. The research presented here documents the first adaptation of RTI protocols to the subaquatic environment, with a scuba-deployable method designed around affordable off-the-shelf technologies. Underwater RTI (URTI) was used to capture detail from historic shipwrecks in both the Solent and the western Mediterranean. Results show that URTI can capture submillimeter levels of qualitative diagnostic detail from in situ archaeological material. In addition, this paper presents the results of experiments to explore the impact of turbidity on URTI. For this purpose, a prototype fixed-lighting semisubmersible RTI photography dome was constructed to allow collection of data under controlled conditions. The signal-to-noise data generated reveals that the RGB channels of underwater digital images captured in progressive turbidity degraded faster than URTI object geometry calculated from them. URTI is shown to be capable of providing analytically useful object-level detail in conditions that would render ordinary underwater photography of limited use.

The vast majority of the natural gas reserve is from the Permian Changhsingian reef complexes and Lower Triassic Feixianguan oolitic shoal complexes. To better understand this reservoir system, this study characterizes geological and geophysical properties, spatial and temporal distribution of the oolitic shoal complexes and factors that control the oolitic shoals character for the Lower Triassic Feixianguan Formation in the Yuanba Gas Field. Facies analysis, well-seismic tie, well logs, seismic character, impedance inversion, and root mean square (RMS) seismic attributes distinguish two oolitic shoal complex facies - FA-A and FA-B that occur in the study area. FA-A, located in the middle of oolitic shoal complex, is composed of well-sorted ooids with rounded shape. This facies is interpreted to have been deposited in shallow water with relatively high energy. In contrast, FA-B is located in flanks of the oolitic shoal complex, and consists of poorly sorted grains with various shape (rounded, subrounded and subangular). The oolitic shoal complexes were mainly deposited along the platform margin. From the early Fei 2 Member period to the late Fei 2 Member period, the oolitic shoals complexes on the platform margin gradually migrated from the southwest to the northeast with an extent ranging from less than 100 km(2)-150 km(2) in the Yuanba Gas Field. The migration of oolitic shoals coincided with the development of a series of progradational clinoforms, suggesting that progradational clinoforms caused by sea-level fall maybe are the main reason that lead to the migration of oolitic shoals. Finally, this study provide an integrated method for the researchers to characterize oolitic shoal complexes by using well cores, logs, seismic reflections, impedance inversion, and seismic attribute in other basins of the world.

This leads to the use of inaccurate compositions and pH values for the mineral-scaling calculations.In this paper, we apply a rigorous work flow (step-by-step procedure) derived from a compositional pressure/volume/temperature (PVT) model to calculate molecular CO2 and H2S distribution, three-phase relative volume changes, compositional changes, and scale-precipitation trends from the reservoir to the wellhead-separation stage using commonly available surface field data, a full PVT software package, and scale-prediction software of the user's choice.A simplified version of the work flow was previously applied to high-CO2 and -H2S gas/condensate wells with production of condensed water only (Verri et al. 2017b).This paper focuses on the field application of our Rigorous General Work Flow (Verri et al. 2017a) to North Sea oil wells with high water-cut and medium H2S levels (approximately 2,200 ppmv in the separator-gas phase) to provide sulfide- and carbonate-scale-prediction profiles from reservoir to separator.The combination of reservoir-, production-, and chemical-engineering models using specific iterative processes (within the work flow) has provided a new and rigorous step-by-step procedure for the prediction of combined sulfide and carbonate scales in oil and gas wells, which can be implemented by anyone using any PVT and scale-prediction software.",,,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,,,1930-1855,1930-1863,,,,,,,,,,"Heriot Watt Univ, Edinburgh, Midlothian, ScotlandChevron, San Ramon, CA USASaudi Aramco, Res & Dev Ctr, Dhahran, Saudi ArabiaSaudi Aramco, Adv Res Ctr, Explorat & Petr Engn Ctr, Prod Technol,Upstream Res Div, Dhahran, Saudi Arabia",,,,2018-11-27,WOS:000450231400007,,

Such assessments have generally relied on sampling and laboratory analysis, limiting the spatial resolution achievable and resulting in delays in data availability. In-situ techniques can provide real time data and temporal trending with significantly improved spatial resolution, particularly if the detection system is combined with a mobile platform. Remote detection also provides benefits in minimizing operator exposure to radiation, particularly important in post-accident scenarios or monitoring of high radiation dose environments such as nuclear or oil / gas facilities. Existing in-situ techniques have focused on measurement of gamma emitting radionuclides which are relatively easy to detect. Pure beta and alpha emitting radionuclides, such as 90Sr and Pu, pose a significant technical challenge. Microfluidics coupled with on-line preconcentration strategies can provide a highly flexible, sensitive platform which can be developed to measure a wide range of beta and alpha emitting radionuclides. Such systems offer the potential for integration into autonomous vehicles, providing significant improvements in spatial resolution and real-time mapping of radionuclide dispersion in the marine environment as well as offering attractive capability for nuclear site decommissioning surveys (pipelines, storage tanks etc). Additionally, such platforms can be integrated into automated control systems providing improved process monitoring and control for reactor operation and waste management.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,1940684,,,,,,,,University of Southampton,,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:15378961,,

Despite this, above-ground biomass is often poorly quantified, particularly in areas where vegetation structure is complex. Traditional methods for providing accurate estimates involve harvesting vegetation to develop mangrove allometric equations and quantify saltmarsh biomass in quadrats. However broad scale application of these methods may not capture structural variability in vegetation resulting in a loss of detail and estimates with considerable uncertainty. Terrestrial laser scanning (TLS) collects high resolution three-dimensional point clouds capable of providing detailed structural morphology of vegetation. This study demonstrates that TLS is a suitable non-destructive method for estimating biomass of structurally complex coastal wetland vegetation. We compare volumetric models, 3-D surface reconstruction and rasterised volume, and point cloud elevation histogram modelling techniques to estimate biomass. Our results show that current volumetric modelling approaches for estimating TLS-derived biomass are comparable to traditional mangrove allometrics and saltmarsh harvesting. However, volumetric modelling approaches oversimplify vegetation structure by under utilising the large amount of structural information provided by the point cloud. The point cloud elevation histogram model presented in this study, as an alternative to volumetric modelling, utilises all of the information within the point cloud, as opposed to sub-sampling based on specific criteria. This method is simple but highly effective for both mangrove (r(2) = 0.95) and saltmarsh (r(2) > 0.92) vegetation. Our results provide evidence that application of TB in coastal wetlands is an effective non-destructive method to accurately quantify biomass for structurally complex vegetation.

The separator uses a gravity separator to extract water from produced fluids. The water is then reinjected into a disposal well, via a subsea variable speed pump.The control system comprises topside computers and fibre optic communication, together with a subsea control module for control of separator valves and monitoring of pressure, temperature and separator water level sensors. The system operates in a closed loop, with water level measurements resulting in control of the water injection pump speed.Key feature is fibre-optic communication at 1.5 MHz, primarily for immunity from interference from the pump electrical supply, operating in half duplex mode on a single fibre. Full redundancy is provided for all electrical and optical equipment including sensors with 4 redundant communication channels.The level sensors use a combination of technologies to give accurate and reliable, long-term measurements in the hostile separator environment.A redundant high-speed general-purpose Fieldbus (DC power and communication) is provided subsea for connection of complex sensors (level sensor) plus others as required in the future.Topside computers, which are fully integrated with the Troll C facility network, provide analysis of the data from dual level sensors, to detect the Interfaces between water, oil and gas, in the presence of emulsions and foam. This is used to control the pump speed in order to maintain a constant water level in the separator.The equipment began integration and land trials in the last quarter of 1998, and was installed subsea in September 1999.",,,,,International Conference on Subsea Control and Data AcquisitionInternational Conference on Subsea Control and Data Acquisition,"JUN 22-23, 2000JUN 22-23, 2000",Inst Measurement & Control; Soc Electriciens & Electr; Soc Underwater Technol; Inst Chem Engineers; Inst Elect EngineersInst Measurement & Control; Soc Electriciens & Electr; Soc Underwater Technol; Inst Chem Engineers; Inst Elect Engineers,"PARIS, FRANCEPARIS, FRANCE",0,0,0,,0,0,0,,,,,1-86058-257-5,,,,,,,,,,,,,2000-01-01,WOS:000089905800001,,

When such accidents take place, the total discharge of hydrocarbons becomes the focal point for all concerned, including the operator, the service provider, and the regulatory body. Rate estimation becomes a daunting task with scant information about the formation and fluids at the time of the accident. Given that new regulatory guidelines require such estimates for any offshore drilling, systematic investigation is imperative.This study presents an analytical model coupling the flow in a reservoir/wellbore system of a gas well. The model considers flow in the tubing, annulus and riser, and the attendant heat transfer in this formulation/wellbore system. To gauge safety concerns, a commercially available plume dispersion model is used to examine consequences of a blowout under various wind speed scenarios in the absence of any ignition source. In the event of gas ignition, the energy of the explosion of the flammable gas is estimated with an empirical method in terms of trinitrotoluene (TNT) equivalency. The energy released by the jet fire associated with flammable gas is also evaluated.Two published field cases provided insight into the model's applicability in actual situations and some perspective on solution quality. However, given the large number of unknowns in any setting, we adopted the statistical design of experiments to understand the impact of independent variables. These variables include formation permeability, connected reservoir pore-volume, and restrictions in flow path, among others. Overall, the model results are in agreement with the previous findings. Specifically, we observed that reservoir permeability controls the flow rate; hence, the cumulative production for a given flow cross-sectional area in the well. In addition, the reservoir pore-volume connected to the well has a large impact on the rate of production decline; therefore, the total discharge volume. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Another huge milestone was achieved, when production systems made a transition from topsides to subsea units for efficiency. Currently, there is an enormous drive to minimize the operational costs involved in the processing of hydrocarbons. Researches are underway towards what would be yet another significant feat in the oil and gas industry, which is by moving the processing systems to subsea. One such impressive concept, which is being developed, is the Submerged Production Unit (SPU). This study is an initial attempt to investigate the challenges associated with the SPU focusing on the factors influencing design, launching and towing. A design concept that goes back and forth from performance and design spaces was used in modelling the SPU, solving the complexity that revolved around assembling the hollow Glass Reinforced Plastic (GRP) beams with subsea buoyancy materials. Submerged Tow Method (STM), an adaptation of Controlled Depth Tow Method (CDTM) was used instead of the conventional way of lifting the equipment using cranes of heavy lift vessels or construction vessels on site during deployment considering cost and safety. OrcaFlex software was used for towing analysis. End force in global X direction on towline, obtained from static analysis was used to identify the Bollard Pull (BP) required for towing the SPU. Dynamic analysis was performed for different environmental conditions to identify the maximum effective tension on the towline. BP requirement of 100t was estimated from the towing analysis.

Mining and other land-moving operations enhance physical weathering by bringing large volumes of shattered bedrock to the surface. Yet, the relative influence of these activities on chemical weathering remains poorly constrained. Here we show that catchments impacted by mountaintop removal coal mining have among the highest rates of chemical weathering ever reported. Mined catchments deliver more than 7,600 kg.ha(-1).year(-1) of dissolved solids downstream. The chemical signatures of these exceptionally high weathering rates reflect the product of sulfuric acid weathering of carbonate-bearing rock, driven by the oxidation of pyritic materials. As this strong acid rapidly weathers surrounding carbonate materials, H+ ions are consumed and Ca2+, Mg2+, and HCO3- ions are exported to balance the elevated SO42- exports, generating alkaline mine drainage. The sulfate exports from pyrite oxidation in mountaintop-mined catchments account for similar to 5-7% of global sulfate derived from pyrite, despite occupying less than 0.006% of total land area. Further, the suite of weathering reactions liberate 100-450kg of rock-derived C.ha(-1).year(-1) as CO2, with an additional 90-150 kgC.ha(-1).year(-1) of C released when HCO3- reaches the ocean. This rock C release contributes to the high carbon costs of coal combustion.Plain Language Summary The reclaimed mountaintop removal coal mines of central Appalachia have exceptionally high weathering rates, with sulfuric acid weathering of carbonate rock releasing more than 4.5 million t of rock-derived solutes and at least 531,000 t of rock carbon as CO2 each year.",,,,,,,,,35,0,0,0,18,0,40,,,0886-6236,1944-9224,,,,,,,,,,"Colorado State Univ, Dept Ecosyst Sci & Sustainabil, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USAUniv Wyoming, Dept Ecosyst Sci & Management, Laramie, WY 82071 USADuke Univ, Nicholas Sch, Div Earth & Ocean Sci, Durham, NC USA",,,,2018-12-28,WOS:000443940300003,,

We studied depressional geographically isolated wetlands on the Delmarva Peninsula (USA) that are seasonally connected to downstream perennial waters via temporary channels. Composition and quantity of DOM from 4 forested, 4 agricultural, and 4 restored wetlands were assessed. Twenty perennial streams with watersheds containing wetlands were also sampled for DOM during times when surface connections were present versus absent. Perennial watersheds had varying amounts of forested wetland (0.4-82%) and agricultural (1-89%) cover. DOM was analysed with ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy, fluorescence spectroscopy, dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentration, and bioassays. Forested wetlands exported more DOM that was more aromatic-rich compared with agricultural and restored wetlands. DOM from the latter two could not be distinguished suggesting limited recovery of restored wetlands; DOM from both was more protein-like than forested wetland DOM. Perennial streams with the highest wetland watershed cover had the highest DOC levels during all seasons; however, in fall and winter when temporary streams connect forested wetlands to perennial channels, perennial DOC concentrations peaked, and composition was linked to forested wetlands. In summer, when temporary stream connections were dry, perennial DOC concentrations were the lowest and protein-like DOM levels the highest. Overall, DOC levels in perennial streams were linked to total wetland land cover, but the timing of peak fluxes of DOM was driven by wetland connectivity to perennial streams. Bioassays showed that DOM linked to wetlands was less available for microbial use than protein-like DOM linked to agricultural land use.

Much of the critical data for forest biomass on which models of global carbon cycling rely is, in fact, based on the accurate sampling of less than 100 ha of forest. Uncertainties in biomass estimation at the local and regional level may be responsible for much of the current speculation as to unidentified sinks for carbon. We have used a forest inventory (i.e. records of forest volume obtained for harvesting purposes) approach to quantify the biomass of forests in Victoria, Australia.Forests were analysed by type, age and region. Regression equations were developed for the accumulation of biomass with age across all productivity classes for each forest type. The mean carbon density for above-ground components of Victorian native forests is 157 tonnes ha-1 (t ha-1), although forest types range in mean carbon density from 250 to 18 t ha-1. Pinus radiata D. Don plantations in Victoria have a mean carbon density of 91 t ha-1 in the above-ground components. Total carbon stored in above-ground biomass is estimated to be 1.2 X 10(9) t. Rates of carbon fixation vary with forest age, species and site. Mountain ash (Eucalyptus regnans F.

Rigid pipelines are key equipment used in the offshore industry commonly employed as flowlines and risers. Carbon steel such as API 5L X65 is the material of choice for those applications due to its low relative cost and availability. However, for the Brazilian pre-salt it seems unlikely that carbon steels can be applyed, since the oil is contaminated by high concentrations of CO2, which causes generalized corrosion. Therefore, operators in Brazil should consider an alternative solution, such as lined or clad pipes as well as corrosion resistant alloys (CRA). Duplex and super duplex stainless steels (SDSS) have emerged in the last decade or so, as an alternative material for harsh environments. Nevertheless, according to recent studies, SDSS when cathodically protected against corrosion are prone to hydrogen induced stress cracking (HISC). The aim of this investigation is to evaluate through fracture toughness measurements the susceptibility of welded SDSS samples to HISC for two different levels of cathodic protection. For fracture toughness evaluation the step loading test method was selected. This practice is believed to be more realistic because samples are exposed to hydrogen during the entire tests instead of simple hydrogen pre-charging before performing the test in air, as recommended by some procedures. Fracture toughness values are given in terms of both CTOD and J-integral for crack initiation and maximum stress for SENB specimens.

Alongshore flow and SRB mobility and potential flux were used to identify likely patterns of transport and deposition. Results indicate that under typical calm conditions, cm-size SRBs are unlikely to move alongshore, whereas mobility and transport is likely during storms. The greater mobility of sand compared to SRBs makes burial and exhumation of SRBs likely, and inlets were identified as probable SRB traps. Analysis of field data supports these model results.

The LNG market is set to increase by 50% between 2017 and 2020. The worldwide fleet of LNG powered vessels is now expanding rapidly and the increasing number of LNG terminals are planned and constructed at major ports around the world. This study proposes a new Organic Rankine Cycle (ORC) with LNG Direct Expansion (DE) for the reutilization of the cryogenic energy within LNG storage tanks and potential waste thermal energy from various sources in the marine context. The proposed ORC system is designed in terms of the field testing data from a real marine application and analysed through dynamic simulation using Siemens LMS Imagine.Lab AMESim. Three optimal working fluids are examined on high vacuum and above atmospheric condensing pressures in the temperature range of -110 degrees C and 300 degrees C. The proposed ORC system is characterized by a significant improvement in thermal efficiency and power production in comparison of the existing ORC systems driven by waste thermal energy.

Wood production therefore has to be enhanced to meet the energy needs of an increasing population. This can be reached by using fast-growing tree species. Grey alder (Alnus incana (L.) Moench.) is an indigenous and fast-growing species, which is well adapted to the harsh climate of northern Europe, and could complement other biomass-oriented species used today. This study aimed to assess the potential for wood production and carbon (C) sequestration in biomass and soil of grey alder plantations under north European conditions. The estimates were based on literature data on above- and below ground biomass production, including fine roots, biomass allocation patterns and litter decomposition. By applying logistic functions on production figures and adding an estimated breeding response, grey alder would be able to produce on average 6-7 Mg ha(-1) yr(-1) of above ground woody biomass during a rotation up to 25 years. This would significantly contribute to increased biomass availability in the Nordic and Baltic countries when applied on agricultural land. By assuming that grey alder will mostly be used on areas suitable for the species, e.g. sites with harsh climate or moist conditions, an estimate of 560,000 ha of newly abandoned agricultural land will be available. Thus, afforestation of those areas with grey alder would result in a total annual increase of aboveground woody biomass of 3.7 Tg, corresponding to 69,000 TJ yr(-1). Grey alder would also be an efficient C sink when used on newly abandoned agricultural land. Using the same areas as for biomass the annual C sequestration in biomass and soil would reach 2.6 Tg C. These figures show that grey alder has a potential to be a significant contributor for increasing biomass supply and capture C in northern Europe. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

The concentrations of PAHs and OPEs in water were in the range of 50.5-74.7 ng/L and 21.6-61.5 ng/L, respectively. Phenanthrene (PHE) was the dominant congener followed by fluorene (FLU) for PAHs, while tris(2-chloroisopropyl) phosphate (TCIPP) and tris(2-chloroethyl) phosphate (TCEP) dominated for OPEs. PAHs in coastal water showed a tidal variability, but not for OPEs, which may due to the influence of occasional wastewater discharges of OPEs. The source apportionments using principle component analysis and positive matrix factorization suggested that PAHs in the coastal water mainly came from oil spill from ships, coal combustion, and petroleum combustion, while OPEs were derived from diverse sources. The fugacity fractions (ff) suggested that ACY, ACE, FLU, PHE, TCEP, and TPHP volatilized from water into air, while TNBP, TCIPP, and TDCIPP deposited from air into water, and FLA, PYR, BaA, CHR, and EHDPP reached equilibrium. The ff values varied slightly with tidal circle, but the variations were not enough to alter the air-water exchange directions of those compounds. Although the influences of tide on the air-water exchange of PAHs and OPEs were limited, tide still played an important role on the transports and diffusions of those chemicals in the coastal water, which requires further studies.

We sampled across an old-growth tropical rain forest landscape at the La Selva Biological Station in Costa Rica to study the distribution and performance of large trees and their contribution to forest structure and dynamics. We censused all large trees in 238 0.50 ha plots, and also identified and measured all stems >= 10 cm diameter in 18 0.50 ha plots annually for 20 years (1997-2017). We assessed abundance, species diversity, and crown conditions of large trees in relation to soil type and topography, measured the contribution of large trees to stand structure, productivity, and dynamics, and analyzed the decadal population trends of large trees. Large trees accounted for 2.5% of stems and similar to 25% of mean basal area and Estimated Above-Ground Biomass, and produced similar to 10% of the estimated wood production. Crown exposure increased with stem diameter but predictability was low. Large tree density was about twice as high on more-fertile flat sites compared to less fertile sites on slopes and plateaus. Density of large trees increased 27% over the study interval, but the increase was restricted to the flat more-fertile sites. Mortality and recruitment differed between large trees and smaller stems, and strongly suggested that large tree density was affected by past climatic disturbances such as large El Nino events.

The purpose of this study was to investigate the removal of emulsified fuel oils from brackish and pond water by dissolved air flotation (DAF) with and without use of coagulants. Experiments were conducted with a 60 L DAF system. Fuel oil-water emulsions were prepared with regular unleaded gasoline, jet fuel, and diesel fuel mixed at 1:1:1 (v/v/v) ratio. Batch and continuous runs were conducted at air pressurization of 354.6 kPa. During both batch and continuous modes, significant petroleum hydrocarbon (PHC) removal was achieved within 10 min. Coagulant addition initially increased the PHC removal by about 5-15%. However, effectiveness of the coagulant was not significant after 20 min due to breakage of the aggregates. In general, the pond water had higher PHC removal than the brackish water. With longer run times, PHC removal improved slightly and the effluent contained increasing fractions of higher molecular weight compounds indicating that PHC removal was due to both OAF and stripping processes. Results indicate that DAF process can be effective both with and without the use of coagulants for removing PHCs from brackish and pond waters. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Micro unmanned underwater vehicles (mu UUVs) are particularly attractive for deployment in extraordinarily confined spaces such as inspection of intricate underwater structures, ship wrecks, oil pipe lines or extreme hazardous areas. This paper considers previous work done in the field of miniature UUVs and presents an optimization framework for preliminary design of that class of UUVs. A state-of-the-art optimization algorithm namely infeasibility driven evolutionary algorithm (IDEA) is used to carry out optimization of the mu UUV designs. The framework is subsequently used to identify optimal design of a torpedo-shaped mu UUV with an overall length of six inches (152.4 mm).

Namely, Ruderal (RU), rubbles over marsh for construction purpose, ELY covered by Elymus elymoides (Raf.) meadows, ART under Arthrocnemurn fruticosum L., SAL under Salicornia patula Duval Jouve, AGR under Zea mays L., and AME under Medicago saliva L. as artificial meadow. Soils were sampled at three depths (0-5, 5-20 and 20-40 cm). At 0-5 cm depth, soil organic carbon (SOC) was higher in ART soil (40.08 g kg(-1)) with respect to ELY, AME, AGR, SAL and RU (23.63, 11.45, 5.77, 4.40 and 3.18 g kg(-1) respectively). Glomalin (TGRSP) in ART had the same trend, with 8.88 g kg(-1) decreased by 51%, 77%, 89%, 92% and 94% in ELY, AME, AGR, SAL and RU soil respectively, indicating that in ART recalcitrant organic carbon may prevail. ART and ELY soils had higher SOC and GRSP than AGR and AME soils at 0-5 and 5-20 cm (on average + 70% and 57%) but SOC values were similar at 20-40 cm depth and glomalin was even higher in AGR and AME soils at this depth suggesting migration of stable organic compounds in cultivated soils. The water stable aggregates (WSA) analysed in the 0.25-2 mm and 2-5.6 mm fractions was also higher in ART and ELY soils (approximate to 90%) at 0-5 and 5-20 cm with respect to the other investigated soils. Higher WSA (fraction 0.25-5 mm) was found in AGR and AME soils at 20-40 cm corroborating that at higher GRSP corresponds higher aggregation. Potential carbon loss as C-CO2 (Mg ha(-1)) was evaluated at 0-5 cm depth and was much lower in ART soil. Accordingly, C-CO2/SOC ratio assigned to ART soil 1.85% of SOC loss against 8.26%, 11.64%, 18.90%, 20.37% and 22.72% of ELY, AME, RU, SAL and AGR soils respectively, indicating that only ART and ELY soils may exert clear carbon sequestration ability. The soil under annual Salicornia patula Duval Jouve (SAL) showed very low SOC (4.40 g kg(-1)) and the highest carbon loss potential (22.72%) due to shortage of organic decaying debris at surface. Also, C-TGRSP resulted higher in ELY and ART soils (2.51 and 1.31 Mg ha(-1)respectively) and C-TGRSP/SOC ratio demonstrated glomalin carbon enrichment in this order: ART > AME > ELY > AGR > SAL > RU, suggesting that carbon sequestration capacity may be assigned to ART and ELY soils, major carbon sinks in the Pletera salt-marsh area. Conversely, RU, AGR and AME soils, identified as ancient salt-marsh converted into agropastoral systems or altered for tourism purposes showed worse soil properties and higher sensitivity to carbon destabilization.

Taking into account various uncertainties, a modified fault tree model for LNG spill accident during LNG carriers' handling operations is constructed in this study. Human factor analysis is introduced with a goal to predict human errors in LNG carriers' handling operation. Finally, the results of the Fault Tree Analysis (FTA) and Human Reliability Analysis (HRA) are combined, so that risks can be assessed using Monte Carlo Simulation (MCS).

The rate of transport of carbon to the deepest oceanic layers is rather insensitive to the atmosphereic-ocean surface gas exchange coefficient over a wide range, hence discrepancies between researchers on the precise global average value of this coefficient do not significantly affect predictions of atmospheric response to anthropogenic inputs. Upwelling velocity, on the other hand, amplifies oceanic response by increasing primary production in the upper ocean layers, resulting in a larger flux into DOC and sediments and increased carbon storage; experiments to reduce the uncertainty in this parameter would be valuable.The location of the carbon addition, whether it is released in the atmosphere or in the middle of the oceanic thermocline, has a significant impact on the maximum atmospheric CO2 concentration (pCO(2)) subsequently reached, suggesting that oceanic burial of a significant fraction of carbon emissions (e.g. via clathrate hydrides) may be an important management option for limiting pCO(2) buildup. Our analysis indicates that the effectiveness of ocean burial decreases asymptotically below about 1000 m depth. With a constant emissions scenario (at 1990 levels), pCO(2) at year 2100 is reduced from 501 ppmv considering all emissions go to the atmosphere, to 422 ppmv with ocean burial at a depth of 1000 m of 50% of the fossil fuel emissions. An alternative scenario looks at stabilizing pCO(2) at 450 ppmv; with no ocean burial of fossil fuel emissions, the rate of emissions has to be cut drastically after the year 2010, whereas oceanic burial of 2 GtC/yr allows for a smoother transition to alternative energy sources.",,,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,,,0165-0009,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1995-08-01,WOS:A1995RQ31000001,,

This is done in various aqueous environments in order to compare said forces in the presence of a variety of surfactants and ionic species. A crude oil droplet is attached to the AFM cantilever and pressed against other droplets placed on a substrate. Differences in the behavior of the forces as a function of surfactant chemistry, concentration and the velocity of the approach and retract of the droplets are observed for droplets with a range of diameters 10 < empty set (mu m) < 70. The surfactant H4 (dodecyl-polyglucoside, designed at the Institut Mexicano del Petroleo) is found to cause the highest forces between the droplets and greatest reduction of drop deformation when pressed together. Qualitative agreement is observed with previous theoretical works with regards to the addition of ionic compounds such as sea-water - the droplets approach more closely and coalescence may be favored in some cases.

Unconventional gas extraction often targets geological layers with high naturally occurring radioactive materials (NORM) and extraction practices may possibly mobilise radionuclides into regional and local drinking water resources. Here, we establish baseline groundwater radon and uranium levels in shallow aquifers overlying a potential CSG target formation in the Richmond River Catchment, Australia. A total of 91 groundwater samples from six different geological units showed highly variable radon activities (0.14-2033 Bq/L) and uranium levels (0.001-2.77 mu g/L) which were well below the Australian Drinking Water Guideline values (radon; 100 Bq/L and uranium; 17 mu g/L). Therefore, from a radon and uranium perspective, the regional groundwater does not pose health risks to consumers. Uranium could not explain the distribution of radon in groundwater. Relatively high radon activities (7.88 +/- 0.83 Bq/L) in the fractured Lismore Basalt aquifer coincided with very low uranium concentrations (0.04 +/- 0.02 mu g/L). In the Quaternary Sediments aquifers, a positive correlation between U and HCO3- (r(2) = 0.49, p < 0.01) implied the uranium was present as uranyl-carbonate complexes. Since NORM are often enriched in target geological formations containing unconventional gas, establishing radon and uranium concentrations in overlying aquifers comprises an important component of baseline groundwater investigations.

In comparison, the concentrations of quinones show little variation between the sampling sites consistent with these being predominantly longer lived secondary pollutants formed from PAH oxidation. The nitro-PAH show a gradient in concentrations similar to but smaller than that for the PAH suggesting a balance between atmospheric formation and removal by photolysis. The 2-nitrofluoranthene: 1-nitropyrene ratio increases from north to south, consistent with atmospheric chemical formation of the former compound, while the ratio of 2-nitrofluoranthene: 2-nitropyrene is consistent with hydroxyl radical as the dominant reactant.

This work demonstrates the ability to influence microalgal N:P recovery ratio via solids residence time (SRT) while maintaining complete nutrient removal across day/night cycles through carbon storage and mobilization. Experiments were conducted with two microalgal species, Scenedesmus obliquus and Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, in photobioreactors (PBRs) operated as cyclostats (chemostats subjected to simulated natural light cycles) with retention times of 6-22 days (S. obliquus) and 7-13 days (C. reinhardtii). Nutrient loading and all other factors were fixed across all experiments. Elevated SRTs (>8 days) achieved limiting nutrient concentrations (either N or P) below the detection limit throughout the diel cycle. N:P mass ratio in algal biomass was linearly correlated with SRT, varying from 9.9:1 to 5.0:1 (S. obliquus) and 4.7:1 to 4.3:1 (C. reinhardtii). Carbohydrate content of biomass increased in high irradiance and decreased in low irradiance and darkness across all experiments, whereas lipid dynamics were minimal over 24-h cycles. Across all nutrient-limited cultures, specific (i.e., protein-normalized) dynamic carbohydrate generally decreased with increasing SRT. Nighttime consumption of stored carbohydrate fueled uptake of nutrients, enabling complete nutrient limitation throughout the night. Dynamic carbohydrate consumption for nutrient assimilation was consistent with dark protein synthesis but less than that of heterotrophic growth, underscoring the need for algal process models to decouple growth from nutrient uptake in periods of low/no light.

The extraction of this energy is one of the great under-utilized branches of renewable energy, and the UK is well placed to exploit this energy: the UK shoreline attracts about 35% of the total wave energy available to ALL of Europe.Although various wave energy converters (WECs) for the extraction of energy from ocean waves have been aroundfor a long time, it is only recently that both government and industry have developed a strong and ambitious interest,and the number of potential WECs for extraction of energy from the ocean wave environment is growing. The interest in this proposal is the OWEL WEC. It is a floating rectangular device open at one end to allow waves in. It is a moored deep-water offshore structure interacting with ocean waves. The wave energy is extracted via a power take-off system. It is one of the most difficult WECs to model.The interest in this proposal is to tackle three main mathematical modelling issues: (1) the dynamics of the waves once they are trapped inside the vessel, (2) the effect of resonance between components, and (3) the dynamic feedback due to multi-fold coupling between interior waves, the ambient ocean wave field, vessel dynamics and mooring dynamics. The ultimate goal is to build up a model which, starting with an ambient ocean wave field, describes the detailed process whereby this energy is extracted and delivered to the power take off system.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,EP/K008188/1,,,,,,,,University of Surrey,,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:15401662,,
J,Chen HongDe; Zhang ChengGong; Huang FuXi; Hou MingCai,,,,,,,,,,Filling process and evolutionary model of sedimentary sequence of Middle-Upper Yangtze craton in Hercynian-Indosinian (Devonian-Middle Triassic),,,,,,,,ACTA PETROLOGICA SINICA,,,,27,8,,,2281,2298,,,,,,,,,,,Article,AUG 2011,2011,"Guided by the idea of tectonic-controlled basin, basin-controlled sedimentary facies, sedimentary facies-controlled source-reservoir-cap assemblage and the principle of process-response, namely that the basin is formed by crust-mantle coupling, plate activation and tectonic movement, and the space-time distribution of the sedimentary sequence and the facies zone association is formed by the sedimentary and filling processes of basin, while the configuration of sedimentary sequence of different orders, the superimposed pattern of system tract and the space-time association of facies zone are closely related with the sedimentary filling process of basin. On the basis of many research and exploration results of the Middle and Upper Yangtze cratonic basin made by previous research findings, it is thought that further study on sedimentary environment, sequence configuration and the filling process of sedimentary and so on are significantly important to deepening the understanding and oil and gas resources exploration of the researched area. Therefore, relied on the sedimentary response records of the profile configuration of sedimentary sequence, the superimposed pattern of system tract and facies zone association, the sedimentary filling process of basin can be effectively revealed by analyzing the temporal and spatial variation law of these records. Specific technical route is that the tectonic-sequence (second-order sequence) that indicates the overall characteristics of basin is considered as the basis, the sequence stratigraphy (third-order sequence) that indicates the filling framework of basin is taken as the research unit. Meanwhile, the sequence configuration, superimposed modes (above fourth-order sequence) and the distribution pattern of facies belts are taken as the research objects. This paper has discussed the sedimentary filling process of Middle-Upper Yangtze cratonic basin in Hercynian-Indosinian period, analyzed the filling characteristics of sedimentary sequence and its difference in typical basin and established the sedimentary evolution model in stages. It is found by the study that both the Middle and Upper Yangtze craton in Hercynian-indosinian period and Caledonian period (see Huang et al., 2011) are similarly composed of two sedimentary system tracts including intracraton and craton-margin and undergo two evolutionary phases composed of the extension phase of craton-margin and the phase changing from extension to compression, while the differences between them are the different basin types and obvious evolutionary differentiation. Generally, the sedimentary filling characteristics of typical basin indicate that the difference between the filling characteristics of the basins in different periods depends on the change of the controlling factors of sedimentary filling process, and the controlling effect of each factor varies with time and place. Consequently, the controlling factors for the filling process of tectonic-sequence are complicated and changeable, which are composed of synsedimentary fault, palaeogeographic pattern, palaeohigh, the change of productivity of carbonate, the change of relative sea level, the tectonic characteristics of basement, tectonic movement and so on.Additionally, all these controlling factors can control the development of the sedimentary sequence by influencing some aspects of the sedimentary filling process of sequence including the boundary condition, palaeogeographic background, sedimentary environment, provenance property, sequence configuration and superimposed pattern, whic is the basic reason for the difference of the filling characteristics of sedimentary sequence. Basically, the sedimentary model of each phase has distinguishable filling background, sedimentary formation type, distribution law of facies zone, evolutionary process and controlling factors. Especially, the middle and upper Yangtze craton in hercynian-indosinian is characterized by the framework of uplift-depression in introplatform and platform-basin in platform edge, in which the high energy environment of introplatform and platform edge provide a good material basis for the development of the high-quality reservoirs, such as the reef-beach, and the low energy environment of introplatform and interplatform basin for the high efficiency seal rocks and the better source rocks.",,,,,,,,,9,30,0,0,0,0,39,,,1000-0569,2095-8927,,,,,,,,,,"Chengdu Univ Technol, State Key Lab Oil & Gas Reservoir Geol & Exploita, Chengdu 610059, Peoples R ChinaChengdu Univ Technol, Inst Sedimentary Geol, Chengdu 610059, Peoples R ChinaPetroChina, Res Inst Petr Explorat & Dev, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China",,,,2011-10-26,WOS:000295657100007,,

In total 46 birds were reported 'oiled', two died, but the majority cleaned itself and survived for up to 20 years after being oiled. From colour-ring data and 30 years of beached bird surveys (1980-2010) it is demonstrated that the effects of chronic oil pollution is larger in winter than in summer; a reflection of seasonal differences in exposure and environmental conditions.

In this study, environmental quality and heavy metals pollution of soils influenced by human activities were investigated. A total of 30 soil samples were collected and subjected to detail physicochemical characterization. The results showed high levels of heavy metals in the urban soils of port of Mahshahr (POM) and elevated respective levels in surface soils of the port of Imam Khomeini (PIK) with Ni being significantly higher than those in POM. The integrated pollution index (IPI) values of metals ranged from 1.22 to 1.87 in POM and 1.52 to 3.31 in PIK, 50% of soil samples in PIK were classified as highly polluted, and all of the soil samples in PM were classified as moderately polluted. These results are in accordance with Enrichment Factor (EF) values, which showed the role of anthropogenic activities in the soil heavy metal enrichment. Moreover, the highest potential ecological risk index (RI) was found in the sites of petrochemical industries in PIK indicating serious metal contamination. Statistical analysis showed that heavy metals were mainly controlled by human activities. The results showed more dense industrial activity in PIK is responsible for higher pollution.

The vast majority of Australia's current CSG developments and reserves are situated in agriculture-rich, cattle-grazing regions; therefore, it is critical to identify symbiotic relationships between agri-based industries and the CSG industry to achieve beneficial coexistence. The CSG industry has generated infrastructure such as gas and water pipelines, water storage and treatment facilities, transportation and electricity networks, and other CSG-associated services (e.g., accommodation, education, and medical facilities), which have the potential to improve regional communities and facilitate economic growth. This article aims to investigate these coexistence opportunities, including the use of by-products (mainly water produced during CSG extraction), infrastructure, and services generated from the CSG industry, which can provide value to the local industries. Focusing on the cattle value chain, the authors suggest an agri-based industrial coexistence model that indicates material-water flows and optimized utilization of infrastructure that not only promote coexistence between the agribusiness and CSG industries, but expand the cattle value-chain productivity in rural Queensland. A water balance has been conducted around the suggested coexistence model with the aim of quantifying water flows, to indicate the supply versus demand scenario associated with CSG-sourced water production.

Models are therefore needed that can simulate the effects of accidental oil spills on early life stages of these fish. In this study, we combined an individual based model and a microcosm approach to infer effects of the water soluble fraction (WSF) and of an oil dispersion (WSF and droplets) on two key endpoints of North East Arctic cod (Gadus morhua) larvae: food assimilation rate and survival probability. Both exposure types (WSF and dispersion) decreased assimilation rate (control: 0.4 d(-1)) and survival probability (control: 0.96) in a concentration-dependent fashion, with EC(50)s of about 2 (feeding) and 40 mu g/L Sigma PAH in the WSF (survival probability). No consistent differences were found between the ECs from the two exposure types indicating no additional oil droplet effects in the oil dispersion. During post exposure, effects on the two endpoints disappeared, which was confirmed by an image analyses we performed of gut content fluorescence. Our results also show that the larvae model fitted the experimental data from the two exposure types equally well, indicating that the presence of oil droplets did not affect model performance. More complex models that explicitly consider possible mechanisms of oil droplet toxicity - in addition to the toxicity of the WSF - on the two examined endpoints during a 17 day time frame do therefore not have a higher accuracy than simpler models that neglect oil droplet toxicity.

The seawater TPH concentrations immediately after the spill ranged from 1.5 to 7310 mu g L-1, with an average of 732 mu g L-1. The concentrations appeared to decrease drastically to 2.0-224 mu g L-1 in one month after the spill. The TPH concentrations in seawater fluctuated with time thereafter because of the remobilization of oil by continuing shoreline cleanup activities and subsequent wave/tidal actions. Seawater TPH concentrations were much higher during high tide than during low tide due to the resuspension of stranded oil. The variation of TPH levels in seawater also matched the spring-neap tidal cycle in the study areas for the first three weeks of the study. Comparisons of the gas chromatograms of the seawater with the water accommodated fraction and the cargo oil indicated that seawater samples were contaminated mainly by the dispersed droplets of spilled oil. One year of monitoring revealed that the oil content in seawater had clearly decreased at most sites, although some regional fluctuations of oil contamination were noted until June 2008.

For a typical jackup drilling rig, adopting the new JSA process and its standards can reduce the total time spent in JSA meetings from approximately 30 man-hours per day to fewer than 4 man-hours per day. In general, work crews enthusiastically approve of the new style of JSA because of the time savings and because it clarifies key responsibilities.

All three types can have significant environmental consequences in certain contexts. Wind power has the fewest and most easily mitigated impacts; solar energy is comparably benign if designed and managed carefully.

Along an and to humid climosequence on Kohala Mountain, Hawaii, we sampled 16 soil profiles and found that weathering and soil properties change in a nonlinear fashion with increased rainfall. The lavas are influenced by a strong rain shadow with mean annual precipitation (MAP) averaging 160 mm near the coast and rising to >3000 mm near the summit. A temperature decline from 24 to 15 degreesC with increasing elevation is matched by lower potential evapotranspiration (ET). A water balance model (monthly precipitation minus monthly ET) defines three broad climate zones along the sampling transect: an and zone with moisture deficit in every month, an intermediate zone with moisture deficit during low-rainfall summer months and moisture surplus during high-rainfall winter months, and a humid zone with moisture surplus during every month. The annualized water balance can be ratioed with the integrated porosity of the top meter of soil to provide a leaching index.The index reaches 1 (total filling of the pore space on an annual basis) at about 1400 mm MAP. Index values >1 imply intense leaching conditions because of pore water replacement. In these 170 ka soils, leaching losses of soluble base cations and Si are nearly complete at index values >1, whereas only 60% of Al has been lost. At index values <1 leaching losses are progressively lower with the lowest rainfall sites having lost 10-20% of the original base cations and Si and none of the Al. At all sites, the secondary clay mineral assemblage is dominated by metastable noncrystalline weathering products; humid soil profiles contain very few crystalline minerals whereas the and profiles contain halloysite, hematite, gibbsite and small amounts of carbonates. Soil surface exchange properties are influenced strongly by climatic conditions and show a dramatic threshold in base cation saturation, pH and effective cation exchange capacity (ECEC) at leaching index of 1 (1400 mm MAP). Soils with leaching index of <1 have high base cation saturation, near-neutral pH and high ECEC. At MAP >1400 mm, soil buffering capacity has been totally exhausted leading to low pH and low ECEC.The nonlinear decline in ECEC is irreversible under natural conditions; base cation depleted soils will remain so even if the climate shifts to drier conditions. In contrast, a climate shift to wetter conditions can drastically modify surface chemical properties existing in the drier soils as weathering depletes primary minerals, elements are lost to leaching, and surface chemistry is modified. There is a time-dimension implied in climate gradient studies; soils forming in recently rejuvenated landscapes contain more primary minerals and should experience loss of buffering capacity at higher rainfall. Loss of buffering capacity means that biological acidity will move more deeply into the vadose zone or into the aquatic system. The details of this transfer depend on present and past climate, and the age and erosional stability of landscapes.

J,,,,,,,,,Douglas Clark,,Quinquennial (half-decadal) carbon and nutrient dynamics in temperate forests: Implications for carbon sequestration in a high carbon dioxide world,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Awarded Grant,Dec 02 2019,2019,"Having more carbon dioxide (CO2) in the atmosphere has increased rates of photosynthesis, promoting greater tree growth and carbon storage in forests. This process is called 'CO2 fertilisation' and results in 2-3 billion tonnes of carbon being removed from the atmosphere each year, which is 25-30% of the carbon put into the atmosphere by human activity annually. CO2 fertilisation, thus, greatly reduces rates of global warming. The fight against climate change relies on CO2 fertilisation continuing into the future; the Paris climate agreement emphasises that global efforts are required to limit the amount of carbon we release to that which trees, soil, and oceans can absorb naturally. Increased carbon storage in mature forests, due to CO2 fertilisation, is considered to be the most important reason for the current carbon uptake. But, looking forward, it is highly uncertain whether such high rates of uptake will continue, because the production of plant biomass also requires the uptake of nutrients from soils. The availability of key nutrients (especially nitrogen and phosphorus) may severely limit the ability of trees in mature forests to continue to grow more rapidly. Studying mature forests is particularly important when determining whether nutrient availability may limit future carbon uptake by land ecosystems. Firstly, as discussed above, mature forests are likely the most important absorbers of carbon on land; secondly, nutrient availability is generally low in mature forests because the roots of mature trees may have already fully explored their soils in their search for key nutrients. If mature forests are unable to access more nutrients in the future and maintain their carbon uptake, then this would have major implications for our society. It would mean that we would have to reduce our carbon dioxide emissions by a greater extent, and more rapidly than currently expected, if we are to avoid the most serious consequences of climate change. Temperate forests currently absorb almost as much carbon as the emissions from all EU nations. While tropical rainforests are, of course, important, mature temperate forests are calculated to be fourfold more efficient at absorbing carbon, and so merit special attention. To be able predict how mature temperate forests will respond in the future, it is critical that we determine whether greater carbon dioxide concentrations in the atmosphere will allow mature trees in temperate forest to:1) take up more nutrients from soils, and/or,2) increase the efficiency with which they use available nutrients to produce new plant tissue.Manipulating CO2 for whole stands of mature forest is challenging and expensive, and until now there has been no experiment that would have allowed us to address the uncertainties discussed above. All this has changed with the establishment of a new experimental facility in mature oak forest in central England. Leveraging a £15m philanthropic gift and an equivalent University of Birmingham investment, a whole-ecosystem free-air carbon dioxide enrichment (FACE) experiment has been set-up, which is successfully forest patches to CO2 concentrations more than one third higher than current levels. In the FACE ecosystem, the canopy trees are at least 160 years old and the site has been forested for the last 400 years. QUINTUS aims to carry out the detailed measurements of nutrient cycling (more than 20,000 analyses) that are required to answer the two key processes outlined above and, thus, determine how a mature temperate forest responds to rising atmospheric CO2. This new experimental understanding will then be used to develop and test the next generation of the computer models which are used to predict future rates of climate change. QUINTUS will deliver a foundational change in our understanding of future C uptake in temperate forests, and in mature forests generally. Such an advance is urgently required and has major societal relevance.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,NE/S015744/2,,,,,,,,UK Ctr for Ecology & Hydrology fr 011219,UK Ctr for Ecology & Hydrology fr 011219,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:15324148,,

The source origin of the PAHs was investigated by use of relative ratios of PAH isomers and indicated that some formation of PAHs was additionally taking place during burning. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

This process is called 'CO2 fertilisation' and results in 2-3 billion tonnes of carbon being removed from the atmosphere each year, which is 25-30% of the carbon put into the atmosphere by human activity annually. CO2 fertilisation, thus, greatly reduces rates of global warming. The fight against climate change relies on CO2 fertilisation continuing into the future; the Paris climate agreement emphasises that global efforts are required to limit the amount of carbon we release to that which trees, soil, and oceans can absorb naturally. Increased carbon storage in mature forests, due to CO2 fertilisation, is considered to be the most important reason for the current carbon uptake. But, looking forward, it is highly uncertain whether such high rates of uptake will continue, because the production of plant biomass also requires the uptake of nutrients from soils. The availability of key nutrients (especially nitrogen and phosphorus) may severely limit the ability of trees in mature forests to continue to grow more rapidly. Studying mature forests is particularly important when determining whether nutrient availability may limit future carbon uptake by land ecosystems. Firstly, as discussed above, mature forests are likely the most important absorbers of carbon on land; secondly, nutrient availability is generally low in mature forests because the roots of mature trees may have already fully explored their soils in their search for key nutrients. If mature forests are unable to access more nutrients in the future and maintain their carbon uptake, then this would have major implications for our society. It would mean that we would have to reduce our carbon dioxide emissions by a greater extent, and more rapidly than currently expected, if we are to avoid the most serious consequences of climate change. Temperate forests currently absorb almost as much carbon as the emissions from all EU nations. While tropical rainforests are, of course, important, mature temperate forests are calculated to be fourfold more efficient at absorbing carbon, and so merit special attention. To be able predict how mature temperate forests will respond in the future, it is critical that we determine whether greater carbon dioxide concentrations in the atmosphere will allow mature trees in temperate forest to:1) take up more nutrients from soils, and/or,2) increase the efficiency with which they use available nutrients to produce new plant tissue.Manipulating CO2 for whole stands of mature forest is challenging and expensive, and until now there has been no experiment that would have allowed us to address the uncertainties discussed above.

A heavily populated region of North America that is subject to similarly conditions is Cascadia, which extends from southern British Columbia to northernmost California. The Cascadia Initiative (CI) is an onshore/offshore seismic and geodetic experiment that will deploy an array of seismometers on the seafloor to complement an array of stations onshore, with the aim of addressing questions ranging from megathrust earthquakes to volcanic arc structure to the formation, deformation and hydration of the Juan de Fuca and Gorda plates. These diverse targets are components of the overall subduction zone system and require an array of seismometers crosses the shoreline and encompasses relevant plate boundaries. The experimental design and objectives, specified at meeting held in Portland, Oregon in 2010, are described in the NSF Cascadia Initiative Workshop Report, which spells out the scientific objectives of the CI, the resources involved and the community-defined OBS deployment plan. This award will support a team of scientists tocaary out and oversee the first year of CI OBS deployments (summer 2011), the planning and operational efforts of the Cascadia Initiative Expedition Team (CIET) and the initial Education and Outreach (E&O) effort. The chief broader impact of the Cascadia Initiative is its very high societal relevance. Achieving a better understanding of seismicity and volcanism in regions such as Cascadia is key to mitigating risks and planning for the potentially devastating effects of volcanic eruptions and great earthquakes. This proposal includes important outreach and education activities as well. The CIET Education and Outreach program will develop two opportunities during the first year. First, the 'CC@sea' project will support community college ('CC') student participation in OBS deployment, retrieval and pre-cruise and follow-up outreach activities in CCs, high schools and the community.

The reasoning is generally based on the assumption that today's competitive process is mainly shaped and determined by the specificity of the international political system. At present, the founding principle of international environment is the assumption of the state territorial sovereignty that reduces the possibilities of action towards resources, mainly to remote supplies via international trade and territorialisation, i.e. embracing the parcel of interest by the state border and its inclusion into the space guarded by state sovereign authority. In turn, this leads to a crucial increase of the expansion on the sea importance, since the land territory is already delimited among the sovereign polities. For Russian Federation this means that the Arctic Region will acquire the greatest importance in the state territorial strategy. The author further analyses the strategies of Russia's competitors from Arctic Region and beyond, and finds out that the U.S. strategy is of the principle importance, even though the Arctic does not present a first rank priority for this state. Nevertheless, the politics of the USA is an example of a novel approach to the outer territories that goes beyond the traditional view on international system. This approach is unilateral and is based on a novel reading of the sovereignty concept. The indicating point is not signing the International Convention on the Law of the Seas that enables the USA to act with lesser need for coordination with other participants of the international system. The instrumental support for this policy is the increasing usage of extraterritorial application of national laws and particular norms. The article provides case analyses of such policies towards resources, companies, international organizations and can be used in the Arctic that presents an ideal place for extraterritorially shaped policy to implement. The article also posits that in Russia the lack of interest toward extraterritoriality of laws is evident, while this could become an effective instrument of the state interest promoting.",,,,,,,,,0,1,1,0,0,0,2,,,0131-2227,,,,,,,,,,,"Russian Acad Sci, Ural Branch, Inst Philosophy & Law, 16 S Kovalevskoi Str, Ekaterinburg 620990, Russia",,,,2015-07-01,WOS:000453169600009,,

Alaska's North Slope communities, management agencies, and private industry are interested in this herd because of its importance as a subsistence resource and location relative to potential petroleum development. From 1998 through 2000, we monitored caribou distribution during the calving period within the Northeast Planning Area of the NPR-A using systematic strip-transect aerial surveys, as well as VHF and satellite telemetry for cow caribou. Aerial survey and telemetry data indicated cows with calves were distributed around Teshekpuk Lake, with a concentration south of the lake in 1999 and 2000. Inconsistencies in weather conditions, survey timing (both strip-transect and VHF surveys), 100% coverage survey areas, and small sample sizes confound interpretations of our results. However, several patterns were apparent. Later transect survey timing (7-12 June versus 4-7 and 5-8 June) resulted in more cow/calf pairs recorded. Our 18% coverage area, originally based on VHF telemetry data for the extent of TCH calving, covered a consistently high proportion (95% to 100%) of the annual calving ranges (95% kernel utilization distributions), but accounted for only 24% to 46% of the adult cows in the TCH based on the current Alaska Department of Fish and Game population estimate (1999) and average 19982000 herd composition. It appears that either our transect survey methodology significantly underestimated the true number of caribou cows in the study area, many cows calved outside the area or moved into the area and calved after our surveys, or we have over estimated the number of reproductive cows in the herd. Our 100% coverage transect areas covering oil and gas lease areas, contained 38% of the calving range with 23% of TCH cows in 1999; and 18% of the calving range with 8% of TCH cows in 2000. Based on 95% minimum convex polygon ranges, satellite collared cow/calf pairs were not stationary during either our survey period (14.7 +/- 6.56 km2; mean +/- standard error of the mean; 4-12 June) or during the calving period (86.9 +/- 72.30 km2; 1-20 June) during 1998-2000. Site specific pre-development data on caribou distribution during calving in NPR-A will be useful for assessing the importance of specific areas to caribou during calving and for designing oilfields that minimize impacts should oil development occur.",,,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,2,0,2,,,0333-256X,,,,,,,,,,,"Entric Inc, 3701 E Tudor Rd,Suite 208, Anchorage, AK, 99507, USA",,,,2003-01-01,BCI:BCI200500119314,,

A detailed metabolism map of 1-MP in this strain was delineated based on analysis of metabolites with gas chromatograph-mass spectrometer (GC-MS). 1-MP was initially oxidized via two different biochemical strategies, including benzene ring and methyl-group attacks. Benzene ring attack was initiated with dioxygenation of the non-methylated aromatic ring via similar degradation pathways of phenanthrene (PHE) by bacteria. For methyl-group attack; mono oxygenase system was involved and more diverse enzymes were needed than that of PHE degradation.

Consequently, it is common for environmental regulatory agencies to apply vegetation monitoring requirements to oil, gas and mining developments. We use two independent, medium-term monitoring studies in semi-arid Australia to examine this relationship at two scales: plant health and survivorship of a threatened subspecies (Tetratheca paynterae paynterae: Elaeocarpaceae) at Windarling Range between 2003 and 2014; and changes in plant health and floristic composition on Barrow Island between 2009 and 2014. Accumulation of dust decreased rapidly with distance from source. At Windarling Range, even at the site with the highest dust load, there was no significant impact on Tetratheca paynterae paynterae compared with the less dusty sites for 10 years. Similarly, there was no significant effect between distance from the source of dust and floristic composition on Barrow Island for 5 years. The probability of plants transitioning to a lower health condition between one year and the next did not appear to be related to dust load. This is further supported by comparing the same site before and after paving the road (removal of dust source), which showed no clear trends. Trends in plant health are likely to be driven more by the variability of cumulative rainfall in the preceding 5 months than dust load. The observed temporal variation in the mean dust load may also be related to variation in rainfall. In conclusion, in these case studies from semi-arid Australia, we find no evidence to support the perception that, under the observed climatic condition and dust deposition rates up to 20 or 77 gm(-2) per month at Windarling Range and Barrow Island, respectively, dust accumulation on plants causes negative impacts.",,,,,,,,,5,0,0,0,5,0,6,,,1442-9985,1442-9993,,,,,,,,,,"Astron Environm Serv, Perth, WA, AustraliaChevron Australia Pty Ltd, Perth, WA, AustraliaCliffs Asia Pacific Iron Ore Pty Ltd, Perth, WA, AustraliaUniv Western Australia, Sch Plant Biol, Perth, WA, AustraliaCurtin Univ, Dept Environm & Agr, Perth, WA, AustraliaUniv Western Australia, Ctr Excellence Nat Resource Management, Albany, Australia",Astron Environm ServCliffs Asia Pacific Iron Ore Pty Ltd,,,2016-09-28,WOS:000382788800008,,

Hazard identification and accident credibility assessment have been used to discover the three most credible fire accident scenarios. These scenarios have been simulated using Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) code, Fire Dynamics Simulator (FDS). The results have then been compared to identify the most severe impact of the fire on personnel and assets using thermal radiation and risk levels. It has been found that the fire event in all three scenarios has a high potential to cause damage to adjacent assets. From this comparison, it is evident that the scenario in the Mixed Refrigerant Module in the liquefaction process has the highest risk of fire to both on-board personnel and assets.

The plume was only observed downwind of circumnavigated gas fields, and three methods are used to determine its source. First, a mass balance calculation assuming a gas field source gives a CH4 emission rate between 2.5 +/- 0.8x10(4) and 4.6 +/- 1.5x10(4) kg h(-1). This would be greater than the industry's reported 0.5% leak rate if it were emitting for more than half the time. Second, annual average UK CH4 emissions are combined with an atmospheric dispersion model to create pseudo-observations. Clean air from the North Atlantic passed over mainland UK, picking up anthropogenic emissions. To best explain the observed plume using pseudo-observations, an additional North Sea source from the gas rigs area is added. Third, the. delta C-13-CH4 from the plume is shown to be -53%, which is lighter than fossil gas but heavier than the UK average emission. We conclude that either an additional small-area mainland source is needed, combined with temporal variability in emission or transport in small-scale meteorological features. Alternatively, a combination of additional sources that are at least 75% from the mainland (-58%) and up to 25% from the North Sea gas rigs area (-32%) would explain the measurements. Had the isotopic analysis not been performed, the likely conclusion would have been of a gas field source of CH4. This demonstrates the limitation of analyzing mole fractions alone, as the simplest explanation is rejected based on analysis of isotopic data.Plain Language Summary In the study, we have analyzed aircraft data to try and identify the source of a plume of methane observed over the North Sea. The flight circuited North Sea gas fields with the aim of intercepting any fugitive methane. Initial analysis of the amount of methane present and its location suggested that the methane was being emitted from the gas field area, and this was supported by dispersion modeling of the case. However, analysis of carbon isotopes in methane revealed that fugitive gas could not have been the primary component of the plume. As methane is often measured without analysis of its carbon isotopes, the authors feel that this is an important cautionary tale. We present our analysis of this case study with recommendations for how best to conduct such analyses in the future to try and avoid potential misdiagnosis of methane plume sources.",,,,,,,,,16,0,0,0,5,0,16,,,2169-897X,2169-8996,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Cambridge, Ctr Atmospher Sci, Cambridge, EnglandNatl Ctr Atmospher Sci, Leeds, W Yorkshire, EnglandRoyal Holloway Univ London, Dept Earth Sci, Egham, Surrey, EnglandUniv East Anglia, Sch Environm Sci, Norwich, Norfolk, EnglandBritish Antarctic Survey, Cambridge, EnglandUniv Manchester, Sch Earth Atmospher & Environm Sci, Manchester, Lancs, EnglandManchester Metropolitan Univ, Sch Res Enterprise & Innovat, Manchester, Lancs, EnglandUK Meteorol Off, Exeter, Devon, EnglandCranfield Univ, FAAM, Cranfield, Beds, EnglandNorwegian Inst Air Res NILU, Inst Veien, Dept Atmospher & Climate Res, Kjeller, Norway",,,,2017-09-06,WOS:000408346000025,,

Although member-level performance and reliability assessment procedures are currently well-established, it is widely recognized that a member-oriented approach does not necessarily lead to an efficient utilization of limited resources when making decisions related to the management of existing deteriorating structures or lifeline systems, especially those that may be exposed to extreme events. For this reason, researchers have renewed their interests in developing system-level assessment methods as a basis to modern structural and infrastructure performance evaluation and design processes. Specifically, system-level performance metrics and characteristics such as reliability, redundancy, robustness, resilience, and risk continue to be refined. The objective of this paper is to extend the content of the accompanying paper on reliability-based performance indicators for structural members by reviewing proposals for the development and implementation of performance-based criteria for structural systems and infrastructure networks. The paper reviews established concepts of reliability design along with emerging ideas of performance-based and resilience-based design that are especially relevant for assessing and managing system-level risk. The paper also studies structural redundancy and robustness concepts as well as network-level performance metrics along with ranking approaches. Insights from these analyses reveal the need for transitioning structural and infrastructure design processes from a traditional component-level reliability-based approach, to one that seeks uniform levels of risk across scales (from structural systems to interconnected infrastructure networks across communities). Implementation examples are drawn from experiences with buildings, bridges, offshore oil and gas platforms, and a variety of infrastructure systems. The paper also reflects on promising avenues for pursuing practical and calibrated system-level performance indicators that support life cycle performance, safety, reliability, and risk of structural and infrastructure systems as integral parts of resilient communities.",,,,,,,,,98,6,0,0,2,0,114,,,0733-9445,1943-541X,,,,,,,,,,"CUNY, City Coll New York, Dept Civil Engn, New York, NY 10031 USARice Univ, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Houston, TX 77005 USALehigh Univ, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Struct Engn & Architecture, Bethlehem, PA 18015 USANIST, Gaithersburg, MD 20899 USALehigh Univ, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Bethlehem, PA 18015 USAUniv Texas Austin, Dept Civil Architectural & Environm Engn, Engn, Austin, TX 78712 USAColorado State Univ, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USAStroNGER Srl, Tecnopolo Tiburtino, I-00131 Rome, ItalyShah Associates, 10 Alderwood Ln, Syosset, NY 11791 USAWaseda Univ, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Shinjuku Ku, 3-4-1 Okubo, Tokyo 1698555, JapanPolitecn Milan, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Milan, ItalyUniv A Coruna, Sch Civil Engn, La Coruna 15071, SpainUniv Rhode Isl, Dept Civil Engn, Kingston, RI 02881 USA",StroNGER SrlShah Associates,,,2016-09-01,WOS:000383156900015,,

To achieve this goal, the paper developed an enhanced hybrid decision-making model which was applied to integrate the economic, environmental and technical performance of these systems. This model can be represented as a semi quantitative multi-criteria decision making process in combination of several novel techniques, particularly 'life cycle cost assessment' for economic analysis, 'life cycle assessments' for environmental analysis, 'fuzzy order preference by similarity to ideal solution' for technical analysis and fuzzy analytic hierarchy process' for multi-criteria decision making. A case study with a 174 K LNG carrier has revealed that the two-stroke low-speed engine system is the most effective overall and suggested that this type of engine system will hold the lead over the other candidates in the large LNG carrier market. It has also demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed model to improve the inherent subjectivity in existing qualitative multi-criteria decision-making processes by guiding the overall process in a more objective direction. Finally, this paper has revealed an underlying novelty of the proposed model to enhance the level of confidence level in the decision by expanding our short-term perspective to the holistic one.

Forests are an important, yet poorly understood, component of the global carbon cycle. We develop a general integrative framework for modelling the influences of stand age, environmental conditions, climate change and disturbance on woody biomass production and carbon sequestration. We use this framework to explore drivers of carbon cycling in New Zealand mountain beech forests, using a 30-year sequence of data from 246 permanent inventory plots.2. A series of disturbance events (wind, snow storms, earthquakes and beetle outbreaks) had major effects on carbon fluxes: by killing large trees, they removed significant quantities of carbon from the woody biomass pool, and by creating canopy gaps, they reduced the crown area index (CAI) of stands (i.e. canopy area per unit ground area) and woody biomass production. A patch-dynamics model, which we parameterized using permanent plot data, predicts that episodic disturbance events can create long-term (c. 100-year) oscillations in carbon stocks at the regional scale.3. Productivity declined with stand age, as shown in many other studies, but the effect was hard to detect because of canopy disturbance. Individual trees can increase productivity by adjusting the positioning, nutrient content and angle of leaves within canopies. We show that such optimization is most effective when trees are large and suggest it reduces the impact of water and nutrient limitation in old stands.4. We found no evidence that forests were responding to changing climatic conditions, although strong altitudinal trends in biomass production indicate that global warming could alter carbon fluxes in future.5. Synthesis. Our study emphasizes the critical role of disturbance in driving forest carbon fluxes. Losses of biomass arising from tree death (particularly in older stands) exceeded gains arising from growth for most of the 30-year study, moving 0.3 Mg C ha(-1)year(-1) from biomass to detritus and atmospheric pools. Large-scale disturbance events are prevalent in many forests world-wide, and these events are likely to be a driving factor in determining forest carbon sequestration patterns over the next century.",,,,,,,,,91,6,0,0,81,0,100,,,0022-0477,1365-2745,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Cambridge, Forest Ecol & Conservat Grp, Dept Plant Sci, Cambridge CB2 3EA, EnglandLandcare Res, Lincoln, New ZealandMichigan State Univ, Dept Forestry, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA",,,,2012-01-01,WOS:000298014400005,,

The tertiary low salinity EOR effect after modified seawater flooding gave an average of 11.8 %OOIP extra oil. Significant changes in produced water pH from initially acidic to alkaline conditions during low salinity injection were observed, favoring wettability alteration towards more water-wet conditions.The results confirmed that low salinity brine behaved as a Smart Water, contributing with significant extra oil recovery in a high temperature sandstone reservoir.

This effort is designed to measure basic descriptive parameters of Cross Island whaling so that observed changes (if any) can be analyzed in relation to such factors as oil and gas activities, weather and ice conditions, or other variables. Special attention is devoted to geospatial information through the sharing of GIS information by participating whaling crews. Project reports are only for the purposes of reporting information collected, with no analysis of the information either as a self-contained database or in conjunction with the many pertinent external databases. As a second broad objective, the project is designed as a collaborative effort of MMS and its contractor, Applied Sociocultural Research (ASR), the subsistence whalers from Nuiqsut, and the Alaska Eskimo Whaling Commission (AEWC). The project will develop a system for collecting information that local whalers themselves can adopt, adapt, and maintain. This report documents the results of the third and final year of this component of the ANIMIDA project. It will be continued by at least three (possibly four) years of additional data collection as a component of the cANIMIDA project. Three methods of information collection are employed - systematic observations, collection of daily vessel locational information from handheld GPS units, and whalers' self-reports and perceptions. Emphasis has been placed on such measures as * Number of crews actively whaling (observation) * Size and composition of crews, and fluctuation over the whaling season (observation) *Number of whales harvested (observation, self-report) * Days spent whaling, and days prevented from whaling (weather, equipment failure or repair, etc.) (observation, self-report) * Days suitable for whaling when whaling did not occur (observation, self-report) * Subsistence activities occurring other than whaling (self-report, observation) * Location of whale sightings and whale harvest (GPS, self-report) * Location of whale searching (GPS, self-report) * Local weather and ice conditions (observation, self-report) * Bowhead whale behavior in the Cross Island area, and indicated differences from past experience (self-report) *Changes in access or other issues related to the whale hunt, such as increased effort for the same (or reduced) harvest, increased risk, increased cost (self-report). In 2003, four crews from Nuiqsut whaled from Cross Island. At least two boats went whaling on seven different days. At least one crew was on Cross Island a total of nineteen days (counting day of arrival and day of departure). Weather prevented whaling on seven days, three days were devoted to butchering and preparations to leave Cross Island after the community quota was taken, and two days were devoted to travel. Four whales were harvested. Weather conditions were poor during the 2003 season, and Nuiqsut whalers scouted for whales on all days when conditions allowed (including the day after the first whale was taken). The final three whales were taken in two days and butchered in sequence. The number of crew members in each vessel scouting for whales varied 2 to 6 per boat per day (most commonly 3 or 4). Scouting trips varied in duration from one hour nine minutes to nine hours six minutes. Total trip distance varied from 25 to 66 miles (with the exception of aborted trips due to mechanical problems) with a greatest distance from Cross Island of from 5.5 to 22.6 miles. Whales were struck from 5.2 to 12.2 (average 9.3) miles from Cross Island.

Although the ovine population is quite low in the province of Livorno compared to the whole region, this area is well suited to agriculture and to ovine rearing. In fact, there are hilly areas, which can be easily grazed by sheep rather than other ruminants, such as cows. In addition, there has been an increased interest by consumers in dairy products from small ruminants because of their nutraceutical components.Aim - To evaluate the farm characteristics and the quality of ovine milk in the area in order to enhance productivity and improve farm management.Materials and methods - All eleven farms in the Livorno district were surveyed through specific interviews, in order to evaluate their management. In addition, 396 samples of milk, collected over three years (2009-2011) were analysed in order to determine the chemical, physical and hygienic characteristics. The variability of milk characteristics according the season, the year, the breed, the height of the farm above sea level and the participation in selection programs were also evaluated.Results and discussion - All the farms investigated were family businesses, and reared mainly Massese and Sarda in a semi extensive way; only one farm reared the native Garfagnina ewe. More than half farms were part a genetic selection program and had a milking machine. The average area of the farms was 144 ha, but size varied: there were several small farms (7-15 ha) and only one large farm (1200 ha). Nearly half (45.5%) of the farms were located at 450 m above sea level, whereas the others were on the plains.The milk was made up of 6.37% fat and 5.42% protein, and its quality is in agreement with the results of other authors. In the summer, the fat content was found to be higher probably due to a lower milk yield. The Garfagnina sheep showed higher dry matter and fat and lower CCS and total bacterial counts compared to the other breeds. The farms that were part of a selection program showed lower bacterial counts.Conclusion - Milk from Livorno district is good quality. A further improvement would be possible increasing the number of the farms in the selection programs.",,,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,,,1124-4593,,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Pisa, Dipartimento Sci Fisiol, I-56124 Pisa, Italy",,,,2013-02-05,WOS:000312938000005,,

We developed a hybrid model to assess the effects of silvicultural management systems on carbon (C) budgets in longleaf pine (Pinus palustris Mill.) plantations in the southeastern U.S. To simulate in situ C pools, the model integrates a growth and yield model with species-specific allometric and biometric equations and explicitly accounts for the impacts of both thinning and prescribed fire. To estimate the ex situ C pool, the model used the outputs of merchantable products from the growth and yield model with current values of forest product conversion efficiencies and forest product decay rates. The model also accounts for C emissions due to transportation and silvicultural activities. Site productivity (site quality) was the major factor controlling stand C density followed by rotation length. Thinning reduced C sequestration, as the slow growth rate of longleaf pine reduced the potential of C sequestration in forest products. Prescribed burning reduced average C stock by about 16-19%, with the majority of the reduction in the forest floor. In a comparison of longleaf pine C dynamics with slash pine (Pinus elliottii Engelm.), both species reached a similar average C stock at age 75 years, but when averaged across the whole rotation, slash pine sequestered more C. Nevertheless, for medium quality sites, C sequestration was similar between thinned 75-year rotation longleaf pine and unthinned 25-year rotation slash pine. This longleaf pine plantation C sequestration model, based on empirical and biological relationships, provides an important new tool for developing testable research hypotheses, estimating C stocks for regional assessments or C credit verification, and for guiding future longleaf pine management.

During the first phase of the Luquillo Critical Zone Observatory (LCZO1), investigators identified differences in rock type, deep weathering, geomorphology, and topography as the dominant drivers of key CZ processes such as nutrient supply, greenhouse gas emissions, and water quantity and quality. Building on this foundation, LCZO2 will evaluate the role of hot spots and hot moments in the CZ: locations or time periods that disproportionately impact the environment as a whole. Hot spots and hot moments are particularly relevant to humid tropical environments such as the LCZO, which are characterized by high physical, geochemical, and biological diversity in space and time. Critical zone processes can occur at very small to very large spatial scales. For example, bedrock weathering occurs at a millimeter spatial scale, while wholesale changes in vegetation and carbon cycling occur over several kilometers such as along elevation gradients. Critical zone processes can also vary over time; oxidation-reduction reactions occur in soils on the scale of minutes, and catastrophic events such as hurricanes and landslides occur at decadal time scales. Investigators will identify, quantify, and model the role of hot spots and hot moments in a range of CZ processes and use that knowledge to predict the rates of CZ processes across the Luquillo Mountains and in other montane areas with high temperature and rainfall. Specific focal areas include: 1) the importance of knickpoints and landscape position as hot spots for weathering, soil development, and biogeochemical cycling; 2) the role of hot spots and hot moments in redox fluctuations and mineral weathering for C and nutrient retention and loss; 3) the role of hot spots for sediment production and hot moments in stream flow for the transport of sediment, C, and nutrients from mountains to the sea; and 4) the development of climate and hydrologic models to scale up hot spots and hot moments in time and space. The data collected and synthesized will transform the understanding of the controls on key CZ processes such as weathering, soil development, C and nutrient storage and loss, soil and sediment transport, and ultimately landscape evolution and the effects of climate change. The project will provide an unprecedented level of detail on hot spots and hot moments in a tropical system. The results of this research will allow us to accurately and precisely 'earthcast' the effects of environmental change on important environmental processes such as flooding, erosion, and landslides. Because all critical zones have hot spots and hot moments of significant environmental processes, the development of the hot spots and hot moments concept in the CZ context will promote cross-site integration, the development of conceptual models of the CZ, and provide a venue for the Earth science community to develop and test novel approaches to CZ science. The LCZO2 will continue to collaborate with University of Puerto Rico (UPR) students and scientists to enhance the participation of underrepresented groups in the Earth and environmental sciences. LCZO2 will also contribute to an existing 'Schoolyard' environmental education program at high schools in Puerto Rico. This program has a successful record of incorporating new data and research techniques into the curriculum and provides professional development for the teachers in addition to research opportunities for students. The diverse group of co-PIs, senior personnel, and collaborators will provide strong role models for research students and postdocs. Our robust collaborations with local and federal agencies and educational institutions provide access to policy makers and other stakeholders that will help us to translate science into policy-relevant findings. Informal forums will be used to share our research findings and to emphasize the significance of CZ research to environmental decision makers dealing with questions such as soil erosion that can fill reservoirs, water quality that degrades water supply and coral reefs, and carbon storage that counteracts the effects of global increases in carbon dioxide. An inclusive and comprehensive engagement plan will encourage participation by scientists not yet affiliated with the LCZO2. The plans for cross-CZO modeling, open sharing of data and samples, and cyberseminars that are open to the public will strengthen the CZO network as a whole and enhance the availability of CZ science to the public and decision-makers.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,1331841,,,,,,,,University of New Hampshire,,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:13572853,,

The Eastern Equatorial Pacific (EEP) is thought to have exerted a strong control over glacial/interglacial CO2 variations through its link to circulation and nutrient-related changes in the Southern Ocean, the primary region of the world oceans where CO2-enriched deep water is upwelled to the surface ocean and comes into contact with the atmosphere. Here we present a multiproxy record of surface ocean productivity, dust inputs, and thermocline conditions for the EEP over the last 40,000 y. This allows us to detect changes in phytoplankton productivity and composition associated with increases in equatorial upwelling intensity and influence of Si-rich waters of sub-Antarctic origin. Our evidence indicates that diatoms outcompeted coccolithophores at times when the influence of Si-rich Southern Ocean intermediate waters was greatest. This shift from calcareous to noncalcareous phytoplankton would cause a lowering in atmospheric CO2 through a reduced carbonate pump, as hypothesized by the Silicic Acid Leakage Hypothesis. However, this change does not seem to have been crucial in controlling atmospheric CO2, as it took place during the deglaciation, when atmospheric CO2 concentrations had already started to rise. Instead, the concomitant intensification of Antarctic upwelling brought large quantities of deep CO2-rich waters to the ocean surface. This process very likely dominated any biologically mediated CO2 sequestration and probably accounts for most of the deglacial rise in atmospheric CO2.",,,,,,,,,50,0,1,0,14,0,53,,,0027-8424,,,,,,,,,,,"CSIC, Inst Ciencies Mar, E-08003 Barcelona, SpainCSIC, Inst Catalana Recerca & Estudis Avancats, E-08003 Barcelona, SpainColumbia Univ, Lamont Doherty Earth Observ, Palisades, NY 10964 USAUniv Barcelona, Dept Estratig Paleontol & Geociencies Marines, Grp Recerca Geociencies Marines, E-08028 Barcelona, SpainGeosci Australia, Canberra, ACT 2601, Australia",,,,2011-04-05,WOS:000289265300015,21422283,

Among the factors that motivate manufacturers to develop differentiated products, it can be cited the rising fossil fuels prices, environmental legislation and increasingly restrictive competition with other alternatives to generate power. Even in the current scenario of global economic crisis, manufacturers and users expect an increase in the number of gas turbines in operation.In offshore oil & gas exploration, the thermal efficiency of gas turbines has been traditionally at the background compared to the operational continuity. However, nowadays many operators are investing in subsea pipelines to export the associated gas produced in the platforms. In this scenario, the gas, which has been traditionally burned at the flare system, now represents a commercial product.Performance monitoring of gas turbines for diagnostic of failures has been developed by researchers over the last decades. There are several diagnostic methodologies currently available in the open literature; however, the amount of publications demonstrating successful application in real cases is still reduced. Regarding the application of performance monitoring for prognostic of failures, the scenario is even more premature. Despite of that, both diagnostic and prognostic techniques are seen as very promising from the User point-of-view.This paper proposes a methodology for performance prognostic based on parameters effectively measured by typical instruments of commercial units. The method makes use of the performance modeling easily found in the literature. The performance parameters measured and also calculated are then corrected to a reference condition in order to eliminate the effects of the variable ambient condition. Future performance parameters are then extrapolated. The methodology was validated through real data of a gas turbine operating in an oil platform. The results showed that the method produces useful information to support the operation and maintenance teams.",,,,,ASME Turbo Expo: Turbine Technical Conference and ExpositionASME Turbo Expo: Turbine Technical Conference and Exposition,"JUN 03-07, 2013JUN 03-07, 2013",Int Gas Turbine InstInt Gas Turbine Inst,"San Antonio, TXSan Antonio, TX",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,978-0-7918-5520-1,,,,,,,,,"ITA, Petroleo Brasileiro SA PETROBRAS, Sao Paulo, BrazilITA, Sao Paulo, Brazil",ITA,,,2013-01-01,WOS:000361500300020,,

Affected by the exposure and weathering leaching in Dongwu movement during the latest of mid-Permian period, a typical weathering crust karst reservoir occurred in the marine carbonate of Maokou Formation. However, with the absence of accurate restore of the palaeokarst geomorphology, the knowledge has been affected of carbonate reservoir distribution developing in the Maokou Formation. The present work mainly analyses materials from drilling, logging and cores, classifying and correlating stratigraphy precisely, establishing isochronous stratigraphic framework,then choosing and confirming two stratigraphic interfaces which are distributing stably and almost isochronously in the whole region as the base levels, namely the subface of Mao-3 Member (the 3rd Member of Maokou Formation) and the top surface of Chang-1 Member ( the 1st Member of Changxing Formation), for restoring palaeokasrt geomorphology in the upper and lower erosional surfaces respectively. Additionally, depending on the residual and impression strata thickness data,it mapped contour map of residual strata thickness and that of impression strata thickness, then restoring, with the software called Surfer, the palaeoakarst geomorphology pre-depositing Longtan Formation and the geomorphology of buried-hill in the top of Maokou Formation post-depositing Chang-1 Member. The geomorphology restored from the uppermost Maokou Formation, reflects that the geomorphology fluctuation and overall framework are accordant with the two methods, which can be classified into 3 secondary geomorphic units, containing karst platform, karst slope and karst basin, and the units can be further divided into sub-geomorphic units including soluble hillock, monadnock, hillock clump, shallow depression and shallow valley. It is suggested that the karst platform distributed in a radial pattern originated from Luzhou palaeo-uplift core, with the gently topography, hummocky.hills, low and gentle ramp, but not with peak cluster geomorphology. And karst slope is found in the platform periphery, of which with gentle ramp stretch in northern and eastern region, meanwhile, those with abrupt ramp appear in western margin of karst platform. Moreover, the Karst basin presents along the line of Yibin- Muchuan- Suijiang, in southwestern of the region, with flat topography and featured with plain geomorphology. Finally, the relationship between the palaeokarst geomorphology units and large-scale reservoir space as well as the condition of oil and gas production in Maokou Formation shows that, the palaeokarst geomorphology predominates the development and distribution of the karst reservoir, and further the production distribution of natural gas. It is indicated that karst fracture-cavity reservoir can be developed both in karst platform and karst slope equally. Karst platform can be regarded as key exploration zone, and karst slope the most favorable zone.",,,,,,,,,16,30,0,0,0,0,46,,,0001-5717,,,,,,,,,,,"Southwest Petr Univ, State Key Lab Oil and Gas Geol and Exploitat, Chengdu 610500, Peoples R China",,,,2015-07-04,BCI:BCI201500496298,,

Here, we describe the long-term fire regime in two forests on the south coast of British Columbia by means of 244 AMS radiocarbon dates of charcoal buried in forest soils. In both forests, some sites have experienced no fire over the last 6000 years and many other sites have experienced only one or two fires during that time. Intervals between fires vary from a few centuries to several thousand years. In contrast to other conifer forests, this supports a model of forest dynamics where fires are of minor ecological importance. Instead, forest history is dominated by fine-scale processes of disturbance and recovery that maintain an ubiquitous late-successional character over the forest landscape.

Tests are performed on smooth specimens with no surface defects; thus both initiation and propagation of cracks are integrated in the SCC resistance. In addition, the loading mode can influence behavior leading to inconsistent results.Recent progresses in the understanding of SCC damage show that corrosion-deformation interactions (CDI) are often involved in mechanisms and can explain the differences in SCC susceptibility of different material/environment systems according to the type of test. The aim of this study is to develop a critical test methodology in order to determine an intrinsic resistance related to hydrogen effects. The proposed testing method is based on results coming from recent studies on CDI during SCC and concerning different material/environment systems.

This study targeted the marine microbial biosurfactants to examine their enhanced production methods and application for the removal of crude oil from soil. The biosurfactants generated by Bacillus subtilis, which was isolated from the Atlantic Ocean, were investigated in this study. The economic production medium using different carbon (n-hexadecane, diesel oil, glycerol, glucose, starch, and sucrose) and nitrogen sources (NaNO3, (NH4)(2)SO4, and yeast extract) was studied. The best performance of biosurfactant production was achieved when using glycerol as carbon source and sodium nitrate and yeast extract as nitrogen sources in the substrate. The production rate was enhanced five times compared with that of the original screening recipe. The fermentative production of the generated biosurfactants could reduce the surface tension of water to 27 mN/m and with strong surface activity (similar to 36.4 mN/m) even after dilution for 10 times. The critical micellar concentration (CMC) of the product was 507 mg/L. A thin layer chromatography (TLC) analysis indicated that the purified product was a mixture of lipopeptide and glycolipid. The microbially produced biosurfactants were further examined as a soil-washing agent to enhance crude oil removal in a soil column system. The removal rates of 58 and 65 % were achieved using the biosurfactant solution with concentrations of 4 and 8 g/L, respectively.

Numerous other countries around the world (including the UK, Germany, China, South Africa, Australia and Argentina) are now giving serious consideration to sanctioning the technique to provide additional security over the future supply of domestic energy. However, relatively high population densities in many countries and the potential negative environmental impacts that may be associated with fracking operations has stimulated controversy and significant public debate regarding if and where tracking should be permitted. Road traffic generated by fracking operations is one possible source of environmental impact whose significance has, until now, been largely neglected in the available literature. This paper therefore presents a scoping-level environmental assessment for individual and groups of fracking sites using a newly-created Traffic Impacts Model (TIM). The model produces estimates of the traffic-related impacts of fracking on greenhouse gas emissions, local air quality emissions, noise and road pavement wear, using a range of hypothetical fracicing scenarios to quantify changes in impacts against baseline levels.Results suggest that the local impacts of a single well pad may be short duration but large magnitude. That is, whilst single digit percentile increases in emissions of CO2, NOx and PM are estimated for the period from start of construction to pad completion (potentially several months or years), excess emissions of NOx on individual days of peak activity can reach 30% over baseline. Likewise, excess noise emissions appear negligible (<1 dBA) when normalised over the completion period, but may be considerable (+3A dBA) in particular hours, especially in night-time periods. Larger, regional scale modelling of pad development scenarios over a multi-decade time horizon give modest CO2 emissions that vary between 2.5 and 160.4 kT, dependent on the number of wells, and individual well tracking water and flowback waste requirements. The TIM model is designed to be adaptable to any geographic area where the required input data are available (such as fleet characteristics, road type and quality), and we suggest could be deployed as a tool to help reach more informed decisions regarding where and how fracking might take place tatting into account the likely scale of traffic-related environmental impacts.

Increases in plasma osmolality (reaching similar to 525 mOsm/kg H2O, or similar to 70% above values in reference fish) and chloride (reaching 214 mM in site C, or similar to 51% above values in reference fish) were detected 4 months after the spill, in parallel with branchial carbonic anhydrase inhibition (to 56% of the activity measured in reference fish) in silversides obtained from the contaminated sites. Plasma cortisol concentration increased progressively in samples from fish obtained 4 (462 ng/mL) and 7 (564-650 ng/mL) months after the spill, when compared to values in reference fish (192 ng/mL). Osmoregulation of a resident estuarine fish is still affected by an oil spill, months after the accident.

Given the economic and social incentives to migrate towards renewable energy sources there has been tremendous interest in the technology. However, at present it is not yet apparent what the most efficient design would be for real ocean conditions. A second open issue pertains to environmental impact. Such devices are able to extract a significant fraction of energy from the water column and can produce local modifications to the bed stress resulting in a morphodynamic adjustment in locations where the substrate is mobile. When sited in an inlet or constriction, a turbine array can influence the exchanges of water between an embayment and the adjacent ocean. An accurate quantification of environmental impact is critical for site planning and permitting. Presently, researchers are examining scientific issues related to tidal kinetic energy extraction using a variety of computational tools that range from commercial CFD codes for evaluating device performance to ocean models for evaluating impact and site selection. Taken independently, such approaches are forced to rely on simplifying assumptions that decrease the accuracy and utility of the computations. The device scale CFD models typically employ a uniform inflow velocity, ignoring realistic site-specific ocean conditions that influence device performance such as vertical shear, surface waves, free-stream turbulence, and eccentricity of the tidal ellipse. Large-scale hydrodynamic models typically employ subgrid-scale approaches to model energy extraction using simple parameterizations to represent the influence of the device on the flowfield. This project will apply a multi-model approach to link the scales of interest. Device scale simulations will be performed using a RANS CFD code with an optimal shape design capability. The shape design procedure uses a highly efficient approach based on control theory for construction of the gradient. For the larger scales necessary for impact assessment and site evaluation, an unstructured grid ocean model will be employed. The models will be coupled using a two-way approach. The device scale simulations will provide momentum loss and changes in turbulent kinetic energy needed for accurate subgrid-scale parameterization of energy extrac- tion in the ocean model. The ocean model will provide realistic flow conditions for the device scale simulations. The coupled approach will be applied to both idealized and realistic domains and will be capable of improving turbine performance in realistic conditions while simultaneously considering the potential impacts to the environment. This project will develop and test a process for optimizing and evaluating tidal kinetic energy extraction across the entire range of critical scales. In particular, the multi-model approach will enable (1) automatic device shape design for increased efficiency in realistic flow conditions, (2) assessments of impact on circulation and sediment transport using accurate parameterizations of turbine effects.

Sensors can also provide crucial data on the state of the infrastructure during, and in the aftermath of extreme events, and contributes generally to the resiliency of our cities. Wired connections are currently used below ground to collect data, but have a number of limitations: (a) Congestion: As sensors are installed via drilled boreholes, there is a limit on the number of wires that can be installed in the borehole and therefore a limit to the number of sensors, and (b) Connections: Wired connections are weak points in the installation and it is not unusual for these connections to degrade and become exposed to the surrounding environment. Once exposed, data can no longer be transmitted. This EAGER award will explore the application of underwater wireless acoustic communication technology to wireless communications through soils. The work includes both experimental and field testing of this wireless technology. New algorithms and techniques that enable wireless data encoding, modulation, transmission, and reception will be developed. Challenges are expected due to greater signal attenuation in soils than in water and due to the non-uniform composition of subterranean soils. However, preliminary proof-of-concept testing has clearly demonstrated the feasibility of such wireless transmission. This is a high-risk, high-payoff project that brings together expertise from geotechnical engineering and instrumentation and subsea acoustic data transmission and signal processing. Potential applications are expected to go well-beyond data transmission for sensors and possibly enable mobile data connections and location services below the ground surface. This work has the potential to revolutionize digital data transmission through soils. The successful development of these technologies could bring wireless communications from above ground to within the soil, and result in a dramatic reduction in subterranean communication costs and increases in data transmission reliability. It could eliminate the need for long communication wire installations that are prone to damage in a corrosive urban environment, denoted by exposure to corrosive chemicals, stray currents, and groundwater, damage from large construction machinery and vandalism. In addition to the breakthrough nature of the project's technical developments, the success of this work will spawn new technologies with commercial potential worldwide. Major economic benefits and the creation of high-paying technical jobs across multiple disciplines within the US are possible. These developments could enable pervasive infrastructure sensing, especially in underground infrastructure that are integral to our urban centers. Underwater wireless acoustic communication technologies have been in development for a number of decades and are used extensively in the offshore oil and gas and other subsea industries as well as in naval operations.

There is also a concern that the bioavailability of oil compounds is higher when oil is dispersed with dispersants. The purpose of this project was to increase the knowledge on how the use of dispersants on an oil spill may affect the passive uptake of PAHs in resting high arctic copepods using Calanus hyperboreus as a model organism. To evaluate this, resting high arctic C. hyperboreus were caught in Disko Bay at > 250 meters depth, November 2013, and subsequent experimental work was initiated immediately after, at nearby Arctic Station at Disko Island Western Greenland. C hyperboreus females were incubated in phenanthrene (111, 50 and 10 nM), pyrene (57, 28 and 6 nM) and benzo(a) pyrene (10,5 and 1 nM) for three days in treatments with and without oil (corn oil) and dispersant (AGMA DR372). After exposure, the highest measured concentrations of respectively phenanthrene, pyrene and benzo(a) pyrene in the copepods were 129,30 and 6 nmol PAH g female(-1). Results showed that with addition of oil and dispersant to the water, the accumulation of PAH was significantly reduced, due to the deposition of the PAHs in the oil phase, decreasing the available PAHs for copepod uptake. While PAH metabolites and a depuration of the PAHs were observed, the copepods still contained PAHs after 77 days of incubation in clean seawater. Differences of treatments with and without oil and dispersant on the egg production were not statistically conclusive, although it is the most likely an effect of the highly variable day-to-day egg production between individual copepods. Equally, although there was an indication that the addition of dispersant and oil increased the mortality rate, there was no statistical difference. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

However, there are significant concerns associated with their sustainability, depletion and cost. In particular, many of the UK's North Sea reserves will soon become uneconomic / depleted, so we need to find alternatives urgently. Furthermore, the combustion of fossil fuels, e.g. during energy conversion, releases carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases that contribute to global warming. The UK is already committed to an 80% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2050, but significantly greater reductions (85%) are likely to be necessary in order to prevent devastating climate change (>2 degree C increase in temperature). Energy conversion for electricity and transport is responsible for 74% of CO2 emissions; new sustainable energy sources are essential. These new energy sources must be CO2 neutral or, even better, CO2 depleting. One solution is to use carbon dioxide itself as the fuel and feedstock material. Our solution is to react CO2 with H2 or water, using chemical, photochemical or electrochemical catalysts, to produce liquid transport fuels, such as methanol. Flue gases from power stations and/or industrial process, such as metal/alloy manufacture, are major contributors to UK CO2 emissions and will be abundant sources of CO2 for the foreseeable future. Many other industrial emissions also contain considerable concentrations of CO2 including those derived from biological processes, e.g. fermentation. The hydrogen required will be produced by water electrolysis powered by solar or other renewable source of energy. The key economic issue lies in decreasing the energy required for the processes. We aim to achieve this via the development of new, highly active metal/metal oxide nano-structured catalysts, which offer superior performance due to their high surface areas, reduced loadings, low overpotentials and which can be synthesised controllably. We shall use three parallel, yet complementary, approaches to energise the process: direct chemical (thermal) hydrogenation, electrochemical and photochemical reductions of carbon dioxide and water.Our team comprises scientist, engineers and environmental policy researchers at Imperial College London and University College London. We have expertise in chemical catalysis, electrochemistry, photochemistry, reactor engineering, materials science, nanotechnology, sustainable chemistry and environmental science.

In this paper, we report on the improvements in the quality of ocean currents collected from the Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler (ADCP).Initially, the ADCP was deployed in a cage that was suspended below the bridle of the buoy. It was an effort to remove the motion of the surface buoy from the current record. Measurements were made at intervals of 30 to 45 seconds over an hour's time and averaged. The cage required a lengthy cable to carry the current information to the payload within the buoy. The movement (twisting, swinging, and up-and-down motion) of the cage put stress on the cable, which was also exposed to long line gear and other fishing tackle, and the failure rate was high. Several iterations of cable were attempted, but the failure rate of the real-time currents remained high. Because of the averaging method, the currents were under-sampled and represented a considerable period of the changing tidal current.The ADCP was moved inside the bridle just below the buoy to shorten the exposure of the cable to the environment. An additional result of this method is to sample closer to the ocean surface. The sampling interval was increased to 0.5 or 1.0 Hz and the samples are averaged over five minutes. The resulting measurements represent a more appropriate instantaneous current speed and direction and average out the motion of the buoy. A comparison of identically configured buoy-and bottom-mounted ADCPs at Station 41036 off the North Carolina Coast indicate that the methodology produces statistically equivalent currents at all but the surface and bottom bins [1].ADCP data from a large number of oil and gas platforms in the northern Gulf of Mexico are collected, quality controlled, and disseminated to the public by NDBC. The quality control algorithms were developed by a consortium of oil industry, ADCP vendor, and Minerals Management Service experts and implemented by NDBC to quality control the real-time ADCP data in March 2006 [2]. The algorithms were developed for low frequency (38 and 75 kHz) Teledyne RD Instruments (TRDI) ADCPs.The algorithms have been expanded to include the 300, 600, and 1200 kHz TRDI ADCPs. The algorithms test for echo amplitude, percent good beams, error velocity, and horizontal velocities. Additionally, a test to determine the presence of the surface or bottom allows these bins to be included in the data stream as the tide changes.

Therefore, it is necessary to develop technologies that can accelerate CO2 removal from the atmosphere. This paper explores the engineering challenges of a technology that manipulates the carbonate system in seawater by the addition of calcium oxide powder (CaO; lime), resulting in a net sequestration of atmospheric CO2 into the ocean (ocean liming; OL). Every tonne of CO2 sequestered requires between 1.4 and 1.7 t of limestone to be crushed, calcined, and distributed. Approximately 1 t of CO2 would be created from this activity, of which >80% is a high purity gas (pCO(2) > 98%) amenable to geological storage. It is estimated that the thermal and electrical energy requirements for OL would be 0.6-5.6 and 0.1-1.2 GJ tCO(2)(-1) captured respectively. A preliminary economic assessment suggests that OL could cost approximately US$72-159 t(-1) of CO2. The additional CO2 burden of OL makes it a poor alternative to point source mitigation. However, it may provide a means to mitigate some diffuse emissions and reduce atmospheric concentrations. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

The microbiome has emerged as a central theme in environmental toxicology because microbes interact with the host immune system in addition to its role in chemical detoxification. Pathophysiological changes in the gastrointestinal tissue caused by ingested chemicals and metabolites generated from microbial biodegradation can lead to systemic adverse effects. The present critical review dissects what we know about the impacts of environmental contaminants on the microbiome of aquatic species, with special emphasis on the gut microbiome. We highlight some of the known major gut epithelium proteins in vertebrate hosts that are targets for chemical perturbation, proteins that also directly cross-talk with the microbiome. These proteins may act as molecular initiators for altered gut function, and we propose a general framework for an adverse outcome pathway that considers gut dysbiosis as a major contributing factor to adverse apical endpoints. We present 2 case studies, nanomaterials and hydrocarbons, with special emphasis on the Deepwater Horizon oil spill, to illustrate how investigations into the microbiome can improve understanding of adverse outcomes. Lastly, we present strategies to functionally relate chemical-induced gut dysbiosis with adverse outcomes because this is required to demonstrate cause-effect relationships.

The soil microbial community assessed using Phospholipid Fatty Acids showed a strong gradient along the latitude gradient across New South Wales, Australia.

Thompson and L.A.S.

The NSW Native Vegetation Act (2003) requires that management of native vegetation including pre-1990 regrowth must 'improve or maintain' site condition, yet there is currently limited information regarding techniques for the optimum management of C. glaucophylla in this regard. We conducted a preliminary study to examine floristic composition, soil condition (to 50 cm) and carbon storage under 'Dense' (dense regrowth), 'Thinned' (dense regrowth thinned 2000/2001) and 'Un-colonised' (pasture not yet recolonised by C. Euglaucophylla) plots on private lands in NSW. Reduced tree density from thinning resulted in increased biomass of the remaining individual trees. Un-colonised plots had significantly more groundcover than thinned plots, which had significantly more groundcover than dense plots. Differences in plant diversity however, were explained by site factors rather than land use. Soils in the dense plots were the most acid but soil pH was significantly higher in thinned plots and pH was highest in soil of the un-colonised plots. Mean values for carbon, nitrogen, sulphur and extractable phosphorus varied among sites, although each were significantly more abundant in the mineral soil of dense and thinned plots compared with un-colonised plots, suggesting that thinning had had a minimal effect on the soil parameters assessed. Accounting for all site components, site carbon storage was significantly higher in dense and thinned plots compared with un-colonised plots due to elevated levels of soil and litter carbon as well as the presence of trees. The results indicate that thinning dense C. glaucophylla can maintain and (by some measures) improve site condition.

To elucidate the mechanisms of SOC storage among the afforested lands, we separated SOC into four specific size/density fractions: coarse free particulate organic C (cfPOC), fine free POC (ffPOC), intra-microaggregate POC (iPOC), and mineral-associated organic C (MOC). Soils were collected from arable land and from areas with four tree species-robinia (Robinia pseudoacacia L.), poplar (Populus tomentosa Carriere), caragana (Caragana korshinskii Kom.), and buckthorn (Hippophae rhamnoides L.)-in 15-yr-old stands. The total soil C stock to a depth of 100 cm was in the order robinia > poplar > caragana = buckthorn, and C increased by 7.9 to 18.2 Mg C ha(-1) compared with the arable land. Stocks of the cfPOC, iPOC, and MOC in the robinia and poplar land were also higher than that of the caragana and buckthorn land. Compared with the arable land, the MOC and cfPOC increased by 4.8 to 11.9 and 1.9 to 5.1 Mg C ha(-1), respectively, in all of the afforested lands, and the iPOC only increased by 0.8 Mg C ha(-1) in the robinia and poplar areas. However, the ffPOC increased by 0.9 Mg C ha(-1) in all four afforested lands. The differences of the SOC fractions among the four afforested lands occurred primarily because the planting of robinia and poplar increased the cfPOC and MOC in the 0- to 100-cm soil profile, whereas caragana and buckthorn only increased cfPOC and MOC at depths of 0 to 20 cm and 0 to 60 cm, respectively. The total SOC fraction was composed of MOC (75.8%) > cfPOC (15.8%) > iPOC (4.0%) = ffPOC (4.3%).

Compared to bare metal stents, the use of drug-eluting stents reduces restenosis below 10%, but implant coasts have to be considered. In restenosis noninvasive testing lacks diagnostic power. We applied a new approach to identify patients with a high risk for restenosis after PCI by combining heart rate (HR) and blood pressure variability (BPV) analyses.Methods: In 52 patients with clinical suspicion of restenosis and history of PCI, we investigated patterns of cardiovagal autonomic regulation prior to cardiac catheterization. The patients were separated in (i) patients with restenosis (CAD+R) and (ii) patients without restenosis (CAD-R), where restenosis is defined as a stenosis greater than 75% of luminal diameter in at least one main vessel. The following parameters/methods were evaluated: Canadian Cardiovascular Society grade (CCS-grade), vessel disease score (CAD-level), left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), heart rate variability (HRV), BPV, baroreflex sensitivity (BRS), as well as HR turbulence and blood pressure (BP) potentiation caused by premature ventricular complexes.Results: Whereas age, LVEF, CAD-level, CCS-grade, and mean BP did not differ between CAD+R and CAD-R, significant differences were found in (i) BPV: diastolic LF/P, systolic, and diastolic UVLF, (ii) in BRS: slope of tachycardic sequences, and (iii) in extrasystolic parameters: heart rate turbulence onset (HRTO) and potentiation of systolic BP (SBPP). Standard HRV parameters did not show significant differences between the groups. Using the two parameters diastolic LF/P (threshold > 0.2) and HRTO (threshold > 0) restenosis were predicted in 83.4%.Conclusions: These results demonstrate that indicators of sympathetic activation or vagal depression identify restenosis in patients after PCI, thus opening a perspective for a new noninvasive monitoring.",,,,,,,,,8,0,0,0,6,1,8,,,0147-8389,,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Jena, Dept Cardiol, Clin Internal Med, D-07740 Jena, GermanyUniv Appl Sci Jena, Dept Med Engn, Jena, Germany",Univ Appl Sci Jena,,,2006-02-01,WOS:000236181500012,16492306,

Storage security relies not only on comprehensive site characterization prior to injection and careful reservoir management, but also on having a suite of intervention and remediation strategies available to implement if leakage occurs. In this study sequential stages of intervention are analyzed and evaluated. The first step in halting leakage is likely to be stopping CO2 injection in the vicinity of the leak (also termed passive remediation). Results indicate that while passive remediation can reduce the leakage rate by an order of magnitude, completely stopping leakage may often require implementation of additional measures. Additional measures evaluated here focus largely on hydraulic controls, whereby water is injected or produced in or above the CO2 injection reservoir in order to terminate leakage. The degree of residual trapping determines the extent to which leakage is ultimately reduced. For example, water injection into the overlying aquifer directly above a fault was able to completely terminate leakage for as long as water injection continues. Remediation was even more effective when water injection above the fault was combined with reservoir fluid production. We also show that in addition to hydraulic control methods, extracting 15-25% of the injected CO2 can lead to permanent leakage termination. The role of reservoir heterogeneity on remediation efficacy was also examined and found to reduce the total amount of CO2 leaked compared to a homogeneous reservoir. Overall this study demonstrates that temporally limited, multi-stage intervention strategies such as hydraulic barriers can permanently stop CO2 leakage from storage reservoirs into overlying aquifers.

Studying this system requires the careful preparation of the sample in order to accurately replicate the natural formation of the water-accommodated fraction that occurs in nature. Low-energy water-accommodated fractions (LEWAF) are carefully prepared by mixing crude oil and water at a set ratio. Aspirator bottles are then irradiated, and at set time points, the water is sampled and extracted using standard techniques. A second challenge is the representative characterization of the sample, which must take into consideration the chemical changes that occur over time. A targeted analysis of the aromatic fraction of the LEWAF can be performed using an atmospheric-pressure laser ionization source coupled to a custom-built trapped ion mobility spectrometry-Fourier transform-ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometer (TIMS-FT-ICR MS). The TIMS-FT-ICR MS analysis provides high-resolution ion mobility and ultrahigh-resolution MS analysis, which further allow the identification of isomeric components by their collision cross-sections (CCS) and chemical formula. Results show that as the oil-water mixture is exposed to light, there is significant photo-solubilization of the surface oil into the water. Over time, the chemical transformation of the solubilized molecules takes place, with a decrease in the number of identifications of nitrogen-and sulfur-bearing species in favor of those with a greater oxygen content than were typically observed in the base oil.",,,,,,,,,11,0,0,0,7,0,12,,,1940-087X,,,,,,,,,,,"Florida Int Univ, Chem & Biochem, Miami, FL 33199 USA",,,,2017-03-01,WOS:000397848300060,28287592,

Then, MNPs are encapsulated by a copolymer of methyl methacrylate and 2-acrylamido-2-methyl-1-propanesulfonate via oleic acid linker. MNPs are prepared by a controlled co-precipitation method in the presence of a dispersant and surface-modified agents to achieve a high hydrophobic or hydrophilic surface. Mini-emulsion polymerization was conducted to construct a core-shell structure with MNPs as core and the copolymer as shell. The core-shell structure of the obtained particles enables them to disperse well in brine and to stabilize at high-temperature environments. The chemical structures and morphology of this nanocomposite were investigated by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy, and field emission scanning electron microscopy. The thermal stability of the nanocomposite was evaluated via a thermogravimetric analysis method for the solid state and an annealing experiment for the liquid state. The nanocomposite is about 14 nm, disperses well in brine and is thermally stable in the solid state. The blends of synthesized nanocomposite and carboxylate surfactant effectively reduced the interfacial tension between crude oil and brine, and remained thermally stable after 31 days annealed at 100A degrees C. Therefore, a nanofluid of copolymer/magnetic nanocomposite can be applied as an enhanced oil recovery agent for harsh environments in offshore reservoirs.",,,,,,,,,7,1,0,0,1,0,8,,,0361-5235,1543-186X,,,,,,,,,,"Inst Appl Mat Sci, 1 Mac Dinh Chi St,Dist 1, Ho Chi Minh City, VietnamDuy Tan Univ, K7-25 Quang Trung St, Dist Hai Chau, Da Nang, VietnamHo Chi Minh City Univ Technol, 268 Ly Thuong Kiet St,Dist 10, Ho Chi Minh City, VietnamInst Mat Sci Agh, 18 Hoang Quoc Viet, Cau Giay Dist, Ha Noi, Vietnam",Inst Mat Sci Agh,,,2016-06-29,WOS:000377434100069,,

Increased wood pellet demand could lead to spatially variable changes in timberland management and area in the USA. This study presents an assessment of the impacts of increasing wood pellet demand (an additional 11.6 Mt by 2030) on land-use dynamics, taking into account developments in other wood product markets as well as expected changes in other land uses. An economic model for the forest sector of the southeastern USA (SRTS) was linked to a land-use change model (PLUC) to identify potential locations of land-use change following scenarios of demand for pellets and other wood products. Projections show that in the absence of additional demand for wood pellets, natural timberland area is projected to decline by 450-15 000 km(2) by 2030, mainly through urbanization and pine plantation establishment. Under the high wood pellet demand scenario, more (2000-7500 km(2)) natural timberland area is retained and more (8000-20 000 km(2)) pine plantation is established. Shifts from natural timberland to pine plantation occur predominantly in the Atlantic coastal region. Future work will assess the impact of projected transitions in natural timberland and pine plantations on biodiversity and carbon storage. This modeling framework can be applied for multiple scenarios and land-use projections to identify locations of timberland area changes for the whole southeastern USA, thereby informing the debate about potential impacts of wood pellet demand on land-use dynamics and environmental services.

When preparing exposure media used for toxicology testing, small variations in simple parameters such as mixing energy, oil type and loading can significantly affect the concentration of the oil components to which test organisms are exposed. The key goal of this study was compare and contrast the physical and chemical compositions of oil water mixtures prepared using fresh and weathered Macondo-related oils under different conditions of mixing and in the presence/absence of chemical dispersants. All samples were assessed for the presence of droplets, droplet size distribution, and detailed chemical composition including polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and total petroleum hydrocarbon by fluorescence (TPHF). Preparations were also tested for stability over a 96 h period relevant to acute toxicity tests. The results indicate that water accommodated fractions (WAFs) produced consistent, droplet free solutions with concentration that represented the soluble components of the oil used. As expected, chemically-enhanced WAFs (CEWAFs) and high-energy WAFs (HEWAFs) generated large amounts of micron-size droplets and their chemical composition corresponded closely with that of the whole oil. However, the HEWAFs were highly dynamic, and unlike CEWAFs, much of the oil resurfaced within few hours of the initial preparation. Viscosity and lack of dispersability are the limiting factors for preparation of CEWAFs with weathered oils, in contrast HEWAFs did effectively introduce large amounts of weathered oil droplets in the test media. Despite this benefit, droplet sizes significantly decreased in HEWAFs with increase in weathering of the oil creating an additional variable to consider. Because the contribution of small droplets to toxicity is a topic that needs further investigation, the interpretation of results from high-energy preparations needs to be further evaluated. When the TPAHs concentrations of all preparations at all loadings were compared with the publicly available water-column data for samples analyzed during and after the DWH incident response they all ranked above the vast majority of the 10,828 samples reported. Until a better characterization of all the available DWH water column individual-component chemistry data is produced the question of environmental relevance and the pursuit of toxicological studies under more realistic conditions continues to be a significant challenge that should be further explored.

This study investigated the option of increasing carbon storage in biomass and poorly productive soils in dryland agricultural systems, while avoiding competition with food production, using tagasaste (Cytisus proliferus Link.), a woody N-fixing perennial species. Perennial plants often have deeper and more extensive root systems than annual plants, and therefore may increase soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks deeper than the IPCC standard sampling depth of 0.3m. Above- and below-ground biomass carbon and SOC to a depth of 2 m were measured on a 22-yr-old replicated field experiment in Western Australia (mean annual rainfall, 498 mm yr(-1)) comparing unmanaged plantations of tagasaste with conventional annual crop and pasture rotations. Carbon sequestration was 2.5 Mg Cha(-1) yr(-1) over the 22-yr lifespan for the tagasaste treatments, with a change of 0.9 Mg Cha(-1) yr(-1) in SOC and 1.6 Mg Cha(-1) yr(-1) in biomass. Tagasaste plots contained significantly larger SOC stocks compared with control plots for soil to 0.9 m, however beyond this depth, treatment differences were not significant. It is recommended that soil sampling be extended to depths of 1 m under such perennial systems with no benefit from sampling to depths deeper than this. In contrast to its current use as a fodder supplement for livestock, this study clearly demonstrates the potential of tagasaste for carbon mitigation within dryland farming systems, especially on soils marginal for conventional agriculture.

There is scarce information on the bacterial diversity, spatial distribution and oil-biodegradation capabilities of freshwater wetland oil-polluted mats. Microbial community analysis by Automated Ribosomal Spacer Analysis (ARISA) showed that the different mats hosted distinct microbial communities. Average numbers of operational taxonomic units (OTUs(ARISA)) were relatively lower in the mats with higher oil levels and the number of shared OTUs(ARISA) between the mats was,60% in most cases. Multivariate analyses of fingerprinting profiles indicated that the bacterial communities in the wetland mats were influenced by oil and ammonia levels, but to a lesser extent by plant density. In addition to oil and ammonia, redundancy analysis (RDA) showed also a significant contribution of temperature, dissolved oxygen and sulfate concentration to the variations of the mats' microbial communities. Pyrosequencing yielded 282,706 reads with >90% of the sequences affiliated to Proteobacteria (41% of total sequences), Cyanobacteria (31%), Bacteriodetes (11.5%), Planctomycetes (7%) and Chloroflexi (3%). Known autotrophic (e.g. Rivularia) and heterotrophic (e. g. Azospira) nitrogen-fixing bacteria as well as purple sulfur and non-sulfur bacteria were frequently encountered in all mats. On the other hand, sequences of known sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRBs) were rarely found, indicating that SRBs in the wetland mats probably belong to yet-undescribed novel species. The wetland mats were able to degrade 53-100% of C-12-C-30 alkanes after 6 weeks of incubation under aerobic conditions.

An important early observation is that aqueous pools of Cu (rivers and oceans) are isotopically heavier than rocks of the continental crust. For Zn, the global average delta Zn-66 for rivers is identical to estimates of the upper continental crust, but the oceans are slightly heavier. Here, we study Cu and Zn abundances and isotopes in soils to assess how processes in the weathering environment control isotopic values of rivers, and ultimately the oceans. We investigated a range of soils developed on granitoid (Scotland) and basaltic (Hawaiian Islands) rock substrates, representing soil development times from 0.1 to 400 kyr, mean annual temperatures of 6-16 degrees C, and mean annual precipitation (MAP) of 1060-5050 mm.Soils developed on the island of Maui over 400 kyr and under high rainfall show the clearest chemical weathering signatures. Here, in oxic soils, Cu and Zn are both depleted by 50-90%, with preferential loss of heavy Cu (delta Cu-65 up to 1.2 parts per thousand lower than parent material), and small shifts in delta Zn-66. We attribute this to equilibrium fractionation between aqueous organic species that are removed from the soil versus sorption to residual Fe-oxyhydroxides. In soils that are 0.1-150 kyr old in Scotland and Hawaii, this same pattern is overprinted by biological cycling and the addition of mineral aerosol Cu and Zn with heavier isotope compositions. In reducing soils on Maui, developed under the highest rainfall, Cu and Zn are almost completely stripped from the soil, leaving a very small residual pool with delta Cu-65 and delta Zn-66 values that range from those for the oxic soils back to and beyond parent material. This removal of the light sorbed Cu seen in oxic soils is attributed to the dissolution of Fe oxides under anaerobic conditions, perhaps microbially mediated, leaving a very small residual isotopically heavier pool. Overall these data suggest that processes in soils create significant variability in Cu isotopes, with the heavy isotope exported from oxic soils. In contrast, small isotope fractionations of Zn are generated in the soil environment. These observations are consistent with those made previously for Cu and Zn isotopes in rivers. But the maximum amount of Cu and Zn stored by world soils equates to only 30-130 years of the dissolved riverine flux. Soils cannot be the ultimate repository of the residual Cu and Zn required balancing the riverine flux, and this must ultimately reside in the erosive products of soil formation in continental and ocean margin sediments.

Especially the Lower to Middle Cambrian and Middle to Upper Ordovician possess the major marine source rocks in the Tarim Basin and have large shale gas resource potential. The Cambrian-Ordovician shales were mainly deposited in basin-slope facies with thicknesses between 30-180 m. For shales buried shallower than 4500 m, there is high organic matter abundance with TOC (total organic carbon) mainly between 1.0% and 6.0%, favorable organic matter of Type I and Type II, and high thermal maturity with Ro(E) as 1.3%-2.75%. The mineral composition of these Cambrian-Ordovician shale samples is mainly quartz and carbonate minerals while the clay minerals content is mostly lower than 30%, because these samples include siliceous and calcareous shale and marlstone. The Cambrian and Ordovician shales are compacted with mean porosity of 4% and 3%, permeability of 0.0003x10(-3)-0.09x10(-3) m(2) and 0.0002x10(-3)-0.11x10(-3) m(2), and density of 2.30 g/m(3) and 2.55 g/m(3), respectively. The pores in the shale samples show good connectivity and are mainly mesopore in size. Different genetic types of pores can be observed such as intercrystal, intergranular, dissolved, organic matter and shrinkage joint. The reservoir bed properties are controlled by mineral composition and diagenesis. The maximum adsorption amount to methane of these shales is 1.15-7.36 cm(3)/g, with main affecting factors being organic matter abundance, porosity and thermal maturity. The accumulation characteristics of natural gas within these shales are jointly controlled by sedimentation, diagenesis, hydrocarbon generation conditions, reservoir bed properties and the occurrence process of natural gas. The natural gas underwent short-distance migration and accumulation, in-place accumulation in the early stage, and adjustment and modification in the later stage.

These suckers are low in sugar content and result in a dilution of the sucrose content of the harvested crop. Differences in the propensity to form suckers have been observed among cultivars within the same experiment and within different parts of a crop of the same cultivar. The environmental factors promoting sucker initiation, or suckering have, however, not been elucidated. A field experiment was run in plant and first ratoon crops to investigate the factors of post-monsoonal irrigation, nitrogen fertiliser level, and within-row stool spacing to test the roles of soil moisture, soil nitrogen and light in suckering. Although the effects of these treatments on mature stalk traits were significant but small, their effects on suckering were relatively large. Increased soil nitrogen and soil moisture promoted suckering and these effects were additive. Plant density, although generating measurable differences in the light levels penetrating the canopy, did not result in a consistent effect on suckering. The effect of suckers in reducing commercial cane sugar (CCS) content was greater than previously reported. CCS was reduced by 1.6 and 1.3 units in the plant and ratoon crops, respectively, for each 10% of the harvested crop mass that were suckers. Availability of excessive nitrogen, in combination with post-monsoonal rain in autumn and winter, will increase suckering and reduce profitability. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

In metal structures, imperfections in the structure such as cracks or material flaws show up in the field pattern generated when current flows in the structure. If the current is changing, the field may be detected as a voltage in a pickup coil. However pick-up coils are bulky and it is impractical to assemble an array of coils that could sense a field pattern over an appreciable area of space in proximity to a structure under test. For this reason, magnetic field testing is not used for sub-sea structures and in general is confined to laboratory use. There is a semiconductor alternative to using sensing coils, called a Hall Effect device. We have a technology which can make these devices as sensitive as coils in the context of field mapping. They have a huge advantage in that they respond uniformly to fields of all practical frequencies, while coils no not. The semiconductor technology makes it practical to produce a camera which can see a magnetic field pattern over an appreciable area. The camera would need a sophisticated current generator to excite the structure. This can be thought of as akin to illuminating the scene. Such a camera would be a major step forward in checking integrity of metal structures. It could be fitted to submersible vehicles and used to inspect pipelines and rig structures. It adds to safety in the Oil and Gas industry.The project involves enhancing the sensitivity of a new type of extremely sensitive Hall Effect devices and building a prototype camera to demonstrate the power of the new technique.

Background notes series,,,,,,,,1,6,,,,,,,,,,,Journal Article,1985-Apr,1985,"Brunei's population characteristics, geographical features, history, form of government, and political and economic situation were briefly described. Brunei is a small country on the northwest coast of the island of Borneo. Estimated population size is 214,000 (1983), and the annual population growth rate is 0.35% (1971-81). Ethnically, the population is 65% Malay, 20% Chinese, and 15% other. The major religion is Islam, and a variety of languages are spoken, including Malay, English, Chinese, and Iban. Education is compulsory through the primary grades, and the literacy rate among the young is 95%. Between the 1500s and the 1800s, the country was a Buddhist kingdom, then a Hindu kingdom, and finally an Islamic kingdom. In 1847 the Sultan of Brunei entered into a trade agreement with Great Britain, and in 1888 the country was placed under British rule. In 1929 the discovery of oil lead to the economic development of the country. During World War II, the country was occupied by the Japanese. In 1984, after resisting pressure to unite with Sarawak and Malaysia, Brunei was granted independence. At that time it adopted the official name of Brunei Darussalam. The country remains a hereditary sultanate, and the current sultan is Sir Muda Hassanal Bolkaih Mu'izzaddin Waddaulah. The sultan has supreme executive authority and is assisted in administering the country by a 6-person cabinet which includes 3 members of the royal family. 46% of the work force is employed by the government, and government workers are provided with an extensive array of economic benefits, ranging from free medical care to low interest loans. The economy is based primarily on the production of oil and gas, which is produced by Brunei Shell, a consortium owned jointly by the government and Shell Oil. Brunei Shell is the country's 2nd largest employer next to the government, accounts for 72% of the gross domestic product (GDP), and is the primary source of government revenue. Oil accounts for 99% of the country's total exports. Imports consist primarily of manufactured items, machinery, transport, food, and chemicals. The country imports 80% of its food supply. Agricultural production is low because of a shortage of labor and the poor quality of the country's soils. In 1984 the GDP was US$4.0 billion, and per capita income was US$20,000. Development plans for 1985-90 stress economic diversification. Currently 35% of the labor force is made up of foreign workers, and most of these workers are employed by the oil industry. Foreign workers are granted only 1-year work permits. Foreign investment is encouraged but carefully controlled by the government. Brunei is a member of the UN, the Association of South East Asian Nations, the Organization of the Islamic Conference, and the Commonwealth. Brunei seeks to maintain friendly relations with its Asian neighbors and has diplomatic relations with the US.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,1049-5517,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1985-04-01,MEDLINE:12178106,12178106,

Relatively low carbon stores were found in riparian shrubland, barren mountain slope, and alpine slope soils (3, 4 and 10 kg C m(-3), respectively). Coastal plain and foothills tundra soils averaged 62 and 44 kg C m(-3), respectively. Active layer to permafrost partitioning of carbon stores varied, but when the carbon stores of the permafrost (to 1 m) were considered along with those of the active layer, carbon store estimates for the tundra are nearly doubled. Cryoturbation played a key role in the distribution of soil carbon stocks. Carbon stores over the pattern cycle of three coastal plain polygon types were found to be similar (59-60 kg C m(-3)). However, the carbon stores of coastal plain thaw lake basin soils ranged widely from 16 to 64 kg C m(-3). In the foothills, carbon stores increased from ridge top to down-slope positions, and increased or stayed nearly constant from midslope to watertrack positions. On the average, the largest carbon stores were in the Cf, Oa, and Bg/Oa soil genetic horizons with average stores to 1 m of 15, 13, and 13 kg C m(-2), respectively. Carbon stores for the Kuparuk River drainage were calculated for the pedon (1 m) and for the active layer only, the results were 2.5 and 1.4 times higher, respectively, than if generalized tundra carbon stores from the literature were used in the calculation.

The results show that while the three pollution metrics tend to agree in their hazard characterization when the shoreline morphology is simple, considerable differences in the quantification of the associated hazard is possible under complex coastal morphologies. These differences proved to greatly alter the evaluation of environmental risks. An integrative hazard index is proposed that encompasses the three simulated pollution metrics. The index promises to shed light on oil spill hazards that can be universally applied across the Mediterranean basin by integrating it with the unified oil spill risk assessment tool developed by the Regional Marine Pollution Emergency Response Centre for the Mediterranean (REMPEC).

As highly condensed PAH pollutants can bioaccumulate in invertebrates, their transfer to vertebrates through the food chain was of concern. This study aimed to estimate potential genotoxic effects in rats fed for 2 or 4 weeks with the marine mussel Mytilus edulis contaminated by oil pollutants. Two levels of PAH contamination were studied, around 100 and 500 mug of total PAHs/kg dry weight (d.w.) in mussels. Genotoxic damage in rats was investigated by single-cell gel electrophoresis (Comet assay) and micronucleus assays in liver, bone marrow, and peripheral blood. DNA damage was observed in the liver of rats fed with the most contaminated mussels (500 mug PAHs/kg d.w.).DNA damage also was observed in the bone marrow but less than that in the liver. A small increase in micronuclei frequency was registered as well. This work underlines the bioavailability of pollutants in fuel-oil-contaminated mussels to consumers and the usefulness of the Comet assay as a sensitive tool in biomonitoring to analyze responses to PAH transfer in food. The occurrence of substituted PAHs and related compounds such as benzothiophenes in addition to nonsubstituted PAHs in fuel oils and mussels raised the question of whether they were implicated in the genotoxic effects registered in rats.

In this paper, we synthesize existing data from oxic and anoxic wetland soil incubations to determine how oxygen controls carbon mineralization. We define the oxygen sensitivity of carbon mineralization as the ratio of carbon mineralization rate in oxic soil to this rate in anoxic soil, such that higher values of this ratio indicate greater sensitivity of carbon mineralization to oxygen. The estimates of oxygen sensitivity we derived from existing literature show a wide range of ratios, from 0.8 to 33, across wetlands. We then report oxygen sensitivities from an experimental mesocosm we developed to manipulate soil oxygen status in realistic soils. The variation in oxygen sensitivity we uncover from this systematic review and experiment indicates that Earth system models may misrepresent the oxygen sensitivity of carbon mineralization, and how it varies with context, in wetland soils.

Natural and anthropogenic disturbances are frequent in dynamic coastal ecosystems and can often be linked. We evaluated potential for disturbance interactions associated with the 2010 Deepwater Horizon (DWH) oil spill, which was preceded by disturbance from Hurricane Katrina in 2005, by quantifying marsh shoreline retreat across both events. Our goal was to determine the degree to which Hurricane Katrina altered baseline rates of erosion prior to the DWH spill. We quantified erosion rate and fetch from aerial images of northern Barataria Bay, Louisiana marsh shorelines classified as reference, moderately-oiled, and heavily-oiled over three pre-spill time periods (1998-2004, prior to Hurricane Katrina; 2004-2005, during Katrina; 2005-2010, post-Katrina but pre-oil spill) and a post-spill period from 2010 to 2013. Prior to Hurricane Katrina, marsh shoreline erosion rates were low (from 0.38 to 1.10 m yr(-1)). In contrast during Hurricane Katrina (2004-2005), erosion increased by 661% and 756%, respectively, for shorelines that would subsequently become moderately and heavily-oiled; reference shoreline erosion increased by 59%. These high erosion rates were associated with increased fetch and higher wave action due to loss of protective geomorphic features such as small islands and spits and persisted during the post-Katrina/pre-spill period of 2005-2010 (0.62, 1.38, and 2.07 m yr(-1) for reference, moderately, and heavily-oiled shorelines, respectively). Erosion rates increased modestly after the DWH event (reference = 1.13 m yr(-1) moderate oiling = 1.45 m yr(-1); heavy oiling = 2.77 m yr(-1)), but not significantly, compared to the post-Katrina period. Consequently, we could not detect a post-spill increase in marsh shoreline erosion. Rather, we concluded that Hurricane Katrina reset the erosion baseline, thereby connecting the two disturbances, and was the major driver of marsh shoreline erosion at our research sites during the study period.

This review summarizes the chemical evolution of subsurface liquid water oceans, taking into account a number of chemical processes occuring in aqueous environments and partly related to material exchange with the deep interior. Of interest are processes occuring at the transitions from the liquid water layer to the ice layers above and below, involving the possible formation of clathrate hydrates and high-pressure ices on large icy satellites. In contrast, water-rock exchange is important for the chemical evolution of the liquid water layer if the latter is in contact with ocean floor rock on small satellites.

Although knowing a forest stand's current state of succession is useful, a clearer understanding of the impact forest harvesting has on the aforementioned ecological processes can be achieved with a more dynamic characterization of the successional process. To more fully model the continuous nature of forest regrowth following clearcut harvesting we extrapolated percent tree cover data collected by the U.S. Forest Service Pacific Northwest Forest Inventory and Analysis program to a cross-normalized Landsat time-series using a date-invariant regression modeling approach. Using three periods of mapped clearcuts we extracted and classified the extrapolated percent tree cover data into four regrowth classes (little to no, slow, moderate and fast). These forest regrowth classes were used to develop frequency distributions describing the landscape patterns of postharvest forest recovery for two ecological provinces in western Oregon. The patterns of forest regrowth observed over the three clearcut periods indicated a much higher percentage of fast regrowth in the Coastal Range Province and a much higher percentage of little to no regrowth in the Western Cascade Province. For both ecological provinces we observed the propensity for faster regrowth on north facing aspects, shallow slopes and at low elevations. The forest regrowth classes and the frequency distributions indicated that a wide range of successional stages could be found in both ecological provinces 18 years after clearcutting. The extension of forest regrowth trajectories to the spectral space of Landsat provided an opportunity to use CART statistical analysis to more fully investigate the climatic and topographic drivers influencing the rate of postharvest forest regrowth. Based on the Kappa statistic, predictions from both CART models were in fair to moderate agreement with the test samples. Both classification trees yielded ecologically interpretable insights into the environmental attributes influencing forest regrowth rates after clearcutting. In both ecological provinces, elevation followed by potential relative radiation (PRR) explained the largest amount of variation in forest regrowth rates. To gauge the effectiveness of predicting more generalized postharvest forest regrowth rates we combined the four forest regrowth classes into two general fast and slow categories. Based on the Tau statistic, the CART models correctly classified 12% (CRP) and 26% (WCP) more combined test samples than classification of the four regrowth classes.

Therefore, it is important to understand the formation and degradation of podzols in relation to (changes in) environmental conditions. For this purpose a Holocene barrier island with coastal sand dunes (Ilha Comprida, SE Brazil) was chosen as study area. The island is build-up of five geomorphic units that have different age (from > 5000 to 325 y BP), vegetation (restinga ecosystems), soil hydrology (flat units or units with ridges and swales) and drainage (poorly drained, well-drained, and improved drainage). Representative profiles were studied for each geomorphic unit, resulting in 100 samples from A, E, B, and C horizons, from which soil organic matter (SOM) was isolated by alkaline extraction. To better understand carbon sources and dynamics, we additionally sampled litter from different vegetation types and DOM from various sources. The molecular composition of SOM, DOM and litter was analyzed with pyrolysis gas chromatography mass spectrometry (pyrolysis-GC/MS). Comparing the pyrolysates of all samples (DOM, SOM and litter) factor analysis demonstrated that the major difference in molecular composition (factor 1) was related to the contribution from DOM (phenol, acetic acid, benzofurans, pyridine, benzene and naphthalene) or in-situ root material (straight chain aliphatics and methoxyphenols from the biomacromolecules suberan and lignin, respectively). The contribution from DOM or roots was characteristic for a profile i.e. without much change with depth. Factor 2 reflected decomposition processes, and showed that the predominantly DOM-derived B horizons were relatively enriched in aromatics compared to DOM, indicating selective decay and/or selective precipitation. In geomorphic units with swales and ridges that received DOM via groundwater flow from the catchment area, the B horizon was predominantly DOM-derived; these profiles showed large differences in the contribution from black carbon (BC; (poly)aromatics), with the younger profiles showing a larger contribution from BC in precipitated DOM. B horizons with a relatively large contribution from in-situ root materials were found in well-drained soils and in some of the poorly drained soils without lateral groundwater flow from the catchment area, i.e., the flat geomorphic unit without ridges and swales.

Our critical energy justice (CEJ) framework helps to identity and defend interconnected components of justice under threat due to profit-oriented global gas infrastructuring based upon reckless disregard for climate science and public health.",,,,,,,,,33,0,0,0,2,0,35,,,2214-6296,2214-6326,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Richmond, Dept Geog & Environm, 310 Int Ctr, Richmond, VA 23173 USAVirginia Commonwealth Univ, Sociol Program, Richmond, VA 23284 USANorfolk State Univ, Sociol Program, Norfolk, VA USAUniv Richmond, Environm Studies Program, Richmond, VA 23173 USA",,,,2018-07-01,WOS:000435003500019,,
