These enigmatic structures, known to fisherman as the Sticky Grounds, trend along slope, are 5-15 m in relief with base diameters of 5-30 m, and suggest widespread potential for mesophotic reef habitat along the west Florida outer continental shelf. Possible origins are sea-level lowstand coral patch reefs, oyster reefs, or perhaps more recent post-lowstand biohermal development. Rock dredging recovered bioeroded carbonate-rock facies comprised of bored and cemented bioclastics. Rock sample components included calcified worm tubes, pelagic sediment, and oysters normally restricted to brackish nearshore areas. Several reef sites were surveyed at the Sticky Grounds during a cruise in August 2010 with the RN Seward Johnson using the Johnson-Sea-Link II submersible to ground truth the swath-sonar maps and to quantify and characterize the benthic habitats, benthic macrofauna, fish populations, and coral/sponge cover. This study characterizes for the first time this mesophotic reef ecosystem and associated fish populations, and analyzes the interrelationships of the fish assemblages, benthic habitats and invertebrate biota. These highly eroded rock mounds provide extensive hard-bottom habitat for reef invertebrate species as well as essential fish habitat for reef fish and commercially/recreationally important fish species. The extent and significance of associated living resources with these bottom types is particularly important in light of the 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil spill in the northeastern Gulf and the proximity of the Loop Current. Mapping the distribution of these mesophotic-depth ecosystems is important for quantifying essential fish habitat and describing benthic resources. These activities can improve ecosystem management and planning of future oil and gas activities in this outer continental shelf region.

Its goal is to make Europe a climate neutral continent by 2050. The most important initiatives of this programme were discussed, such as achieving emission neutrality on a global level for CO2, including a wide range of renewable energy sources in the energy system, establishing a circular economy or achieving zero emissions of pollutants for a non-toxic environment. The objectives of the industrial transformation are presented, in which the main role is played by the energy sector focusing on decarbonisation and replacing fossil fuels (natural gas, oil, coal) with new carriers (hydrogen), reducing environmental degradation. Various labels of hydrogen (green, blue, violet, black) used in practice, depending on the source, are indicated. The so-called green hydrogen produced with the use of renewable energy (e.g. from photovoltaic power plants or offshore wind farms) enjoys full acceptance by the EU. It leaves the smallest carbon footprint in the process of generation. Attention was drawn to the hydrogen strategies developed in individual EU Member States, including Poland, which take into account not only new technologies of obtaining hydrogen, but also the entire complex of issues related to its transmission, distribution, storage and use. The discussion focused on the so-called hydrogen programs carried out in Poland by various State Treasury companies, as well as the Oil and Gas Institute - National Research Institute, concerning, among other things, a research station for the refuelling of vehicles with hydrogen, a hydrogen purification system or the creation of a laboratory for testing alternative fuels. Programmes supporting the transformation of the economy in the area of research, development and innovation, such as the Horizon Europe or Digital Europe framework programmes, are presented as a source of financing for these transformation efforts.",,,,,,,,,4,0,0,0,0,0,4,,,0867-8871,,,,,,,,,,,"Panstwowy Inst Badawczy, Inst Nafty & Gazu, Warsaw, Poland",,,,2021-02-19,WOS:000610406200012,,

From these surveys, we estimated that there was a minimum of 430,000 juvenile bocaccio at these eight structures. We determined this number to be about 20% of the average number of juvenile bocaccio that survive annually for the geographic range of the species. When these juveniles become adults, they will contribute about one percent (0.8%) of the additional amount of fish needed to rebuild the Pacific Coast population. By comparison, juvenile bocaccio recruitment to nearshore natural nursery grounds, as determined through regional scuba surveys, was low in the same year.

Transport of power from wind farms in this section of the country to the coastal regions where population and the need for power are high is limited by the capacity of the electrical grid, which was designed to link power sources (mainly coal and nuclear plants) located close to demand centers. Television and radio broadcasters are heavy consumers of electrical power with transmission facilities distributed across all regions of the US. Most regions are served by broadcasters with transmitters on or adjacent to farmland. In many cases, the placement of 1 turbine on each of these farms would generate enough power for both the farmer and the broadcaster. TV and FM broadcasters spend more than $400MM annually on transmitter power. A distributed wind cooperative among broadcasters and farmers will bring many benefits to both local economy and environment. Immediate benefits to the agriculture industry include a new, reliable, on-site cash generating wind energy crop that can be sold locally. The project will enable substantial amounts of money spent for energy to remain in local, rural communities. It will also help to provide a steady income for farmers and prevent the sale or repossession of the family farm due to financial hardship. These distributed, local community-based, renewable power systems have been prevalent in Europe for decades. Distributed wind energy systems circumvent the national power grid constraints by utilizing the power directly, on site. There are approximately 1,200 TV and 2,600 FM transmitters in the 12 windswept Midwest states and another 14,000 transmitters in the remaining states. If fully realized, distributed wind turbines serving all TV and FM markets have the potential to produce approximately 4 TW hours of renewable energy and eliminate 2.5 million metric tons of CO2 annually. It has been well established that wind turbines can cause interference to TV and Radio transmissions. Phases 1 and 2 of this project will develop an interference prediction model that can be used to properly place turbines on farms in close proximity to transmission towers while eliminating or mitigating problems with signal interference. Phase 3 will demonstrate the full technical and economic performance of an operating transmitter powered by and co-sited with a fully operational wind turbine.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,2011-33610-30427; 579616,,,,,,,,ROBERT MILLER CONSULTING LLC,ROBERT MILLER CONSULTING LLC,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:13006448,,

They likely comprise more biomass than all surface fauna, providing food sources for fishes and playing important roles as predators, herbivores, detritivores, filter feeders, and scavengers. In an era of global change, it is necessary to determine how these communities are structured across reef habitats as well as to understand how reef framework degradation will impact the cryptofauna and, by extension, ecosystem function. Artificial reef framework units were constructed from coral rubble to approximate framework substrates. Forty replicates were subjected to treatments of differing porosity, flow, and coral cover in a fully crossed ANOVA design. After 2 mo in situ, all motile cryptofauna (>2 mm) were counted, weighed, and identified to the lowest possible level. A total of 11 309 specimens were collected, comprising >121 species from 6 separate phyla. Cryptofaunal abundances and biomass were higher in low-porosity crypts and biomass was greater in slow-flow environments, highlighting the importance of sheltered low-porosity habitats, such as back-reef rubble plains. The presence of live coral was not found to have a significant effect on the motile cryptofauna occupying the dead coral framework below it, suggesting a high degree of resilience in how framework-dwelling fauna respond to coral mortality. These data support the assertion that artificial reefs are capable of facilitating the accumulation of a diverse cryptic community, independent of live coral, provided they contain suitably porous crypts.",,,,,,,,,55,0,0,0,51,3,61,,,0171-8630,1616-1599,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Miami, Rosenstiel Sch Marine & Atmospher Sci, Cooperat Inst Marine & Atmospher Sci, Miami, FL 33149 USANOAA, AOML, Miami, FL 33149 USAFlorida Inst Technol, Dept Biol Sci, Melbourne, FL 32901 USA",,,,2011-01-01,WOS:000295616000009,,

These measures were combined into an Index of Relative Importance (IRI). The data set was then analyzed with cluster and detrended correspondence (DCA) analyses. Forage items of the reef fishes were dominated by fishes, xanthid crabs, unidentified items, squids, polychaetes, and penaeid shrimps. The DCA and cluster analysis revealed that these 25 artificial reef fishes could be organized into seven feeding guilds: lower structure pickers, ambush predators, lower structure crustacean predators, upper structure pickers, upper structure predators, water column pickers, and reef-associated open-water feeders. All of the demersal gamefish in this study were in the same feeding guild (i.e., reef-associated openwater feeders). Species in this feeding guild were associated with artificial reefs diurnally and foraged away from reefs nocturnally.

Social and economic issues have been addressed through charter boat and diver mail-in questionnaire surveys and on-site creel surveys. Biological issues have been investigated through hook and line tagging, diver-based visual transects, and video traps. Assessments of hydroacoustic and remotely operated vehicle (ROV) biological survey techniques are also planned for deepwater reef sites. There is also a need to develop inexpensive biological monitoring methods to track target fish populations such as red snapper over time at specific reef sites. The Department has been investigating the use of collapsible traps to tag fish underwater as a potential long-term monitoring tool for assessing reef fish populations. The cost effectiveness and efficiency of this gear type was compared to hook and line capture techniques. During the initial effort, 223 red snapper were tagged underwater by divers after capture by three collapsible traps, and 291 red snapper were tagged on the surface by anglers after capture by hook and line techniques. The collapsible traps appeared to be more size selective for smaller sized red snapper than hook and line techniques. Fish tagged underwater had a higher recapture rate of 25.45 percent compared to the 11.89 percent recapture rate for fish caught and tagged on the surface. Although three recapture periods were used to evaluate tag return data, our findings suggest that future efforts directed at monitoring artificial reef fish populations should use multiple gear types with equal effort applied to account for size-selective capture patterns and logistical constraints.",,,,,,,,,2,0,0,0,2,0,3,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1998-06-01,BCI:BCI199900215649,,

Recent studies have demonstrated the value of investigating the flow phenomena in and around artificial reefs as a means of identifying their fish-attracting features. Field measurements of the flow field have traditionally been obtained using some form of probe mounted on the reef itself. However, such instrumentation tends to disturb the flow, and hence the acquired data may not accurately reflect the true features of the flow field. Accordingly, this study conducts non-invasive particle image velocimetry (PIV) measurements to study the flow patterns in and around an artifical reef deployed within a horizontal circulating water channel. The PIV results are then used to verify the numerical results obtained from finite volume method (FVM) simulations of the same flow scenario. The good general agreement found between the two sets of results indicates that numerical methods provide a valid and powerful means of modeling the flow fields in and around artificial reefs. Particularly, numerical simulation techniques offer the potential to explore the complex flow phenomena induced by double and multiple-reef block configurations, and therefore overcome the size constraint limitations of conventional PIV-based experimental methods.",,,,,17th International Offshore and Polar Engineering Conference (ISOPE 2007)17th International Offshore and Polar Engineering Conference (ISOPE 2007),"JUL 01-06, 2007JUL 01-06, 2007",,"Lisbon, PORTUGALLisbon, PORTUGAL",7,2,0,0,3,0,9,,,1098-6189,,978-1-880653-68-5,,,,,,,,,,,,,2007-01-01,WOS:000250717702077,,

It is predicted that it could provide all the UK's electricity requirement, with minimal emission and visual impacts. However, there exist a major barrier to further exploitation due to the high levelised cost of electricity (LCOE) from offshore wind (£140/MWhr), which is 2-3 times higher than other key renewable sources (onshore wind and solar) and nuclear (a large non-renewable, but low emission source).The high LCOE is caused by the severe environmental conditions, which results in high operational, reliability and maintenance (O&M) costs, with the seabed turbine foundations (largely monopiles) accounting for over 25% of all lifecycle O&M costs, often caused by marine biofouling.Current methods of fouling prevention (dangerous: diver-deployed cleaning tools such as brushes and power jets) or ROVs (high annual costs ~ £30k/MW) are proving very costly and ineffective -- creating the need for an innovative solution to tackle this problem.The project will develop a fouling management system consisting of a mobile survey and cleaning robot that will eliminate the need for divers and ROVs. The robot will be placed on the turbine structure at sea level and will journey down below sea level to the work place. The robot will travel autonomously over the entire subsea monopile surface, imaging the fouling in real time. It will simultaneously activate its cleaning function at every fouled location and remove the fouling with an innovative guided power ultrasound technique. On returning to the sea surface the robot would simply be transported to the next turbine scheduled for treatment, and the cycle repeated. Overall O&M costs will be reduced by at least 50% compared with present diver/ROV techniques.

Grunts of the speciose genus Haemulon are among the most abundant fishes on western North Atlantic coral reefs, with most species settling to shallow habitats (<= 12 m). To gain understanding into cross-shelf distributional patterns exhibited by newly settled stages of grunts <2 cm total length), we examined: 1) depth-specific distributions of congeners at settlement among sites at 8 m, 12 m, and 21 m, and 2) depth-variable predation pressure on newly settled individuals (species pooled). Of the six species identified from collections of newly settled specimens (n = 2125), Haemulon aurolineatum (tomtate), H. flavolineatum (French grunt), and H. striatum (striped grunt) comprised 98% of the total abundance; with the first two species present at all sites. Prevalence of H. aurolineatum and H. flavolineatum decreased substantially from the 8-m site to the two deeper sites. In contrast, H. striatum was absent from the 8-m site and exhibited its highest frequency at the 21-m site. Comparison of newly settled grunt delta density for all species on caged (predator exclusion) and control artificial reefs at the shallowest site (8-m) revealed no difference, while the 12-m and 21-m sites exhibited significantly greater delta densities on the caged treatment. This result, along with significantly higher abundances of co-occurring piscivorous fishes at the deeper sites, indicated lower predation pressure at the 8-m site. This study suggests habitat-use patterns of newly settled stages of some coral reef fishes that undergo ontogenetic shifts are a function of depth-variable predation pressure while, for at least one deeper-water species, proximity to adult habitat appears to be an important factor affecting settlement distribution.

Current findings suggest that after 16 years the ARs (concrete blocks), located in southern Portugal, do not act as surrogates for NRs, as epibenthic assemblages differed between reef types in composition, structure and trophic function. NRs showed higher diversity and complementarity (i.e. beta-diversity) than ARs, evidencing higher redundancy. Higher heterogeneity within NRs was also evidenced by the multi-dimensional scaling analysis based on abundance, biomass and trophic composition. NRs presented higher abundance of molluscs and biomass of sponges, resulting in differences in the trophic function: suspension-feeding dominated the NRs, while within ARs there was an ascendency of carnivory. Although not acting as surrogates for NRs and provided that no adverse effects (e.g. establishment of non-native species) were detected, ARs may have a significant contribution for the increase of regional diversity, as evidenced by the highest complementarity levels observed between assemblages in both reefs.

With expensive equipment hire spanning several years, installation is an area where large savings can potentially be made. Installation operations are subject to uncertain weather conditions, with more extreme conditions as OWF developments tend towards larger sites, further offshore in deeper waters. One approach to reduce the cost of the installation process is to evaluate advanced technologies or operational practices. However, in order to demonstrate cost savings, the impact of these advances on the installation process must be quantified in the presence of uncertain environmental conditions. To addresses this challenge a simulation tool is developed to model the logistics of the installation process and to identify the vessels and operations most sensitive to weather delays. These operations are explored to identify the impact of technological or operational advances with respect to weather delays and the resulting installation duration under different levels of weather severity. The tool identifies that loading operations contribute significantly to the overall delay of the installation process, and that a non-linear relationship exists between vessel operational limits and the duration of installation.

Therefore, the effect on the flow field made by artificial fishery reefs is the basis of their effect on the ecosystem. The flow field is mainly affected by the shape of the artificial reefs. It is important to have a good understand on the hydrodynamic characteristics of various reefs for the shape-selection in the designing plan of artificial reefs. In the present work, the flow field around the truncated-cone shaped artificial reef was numerically simulated to investigate its hydrodynamic characteristics by means of CFD software FLUENT (a special software package for the computational fluid mechanics) under five incoming velocities (0. 1, 0. 2, 0. 4, 0. 6 and 0. 8 meter per second respectively). And then, flume experiments were performed with the models of selected shape. Comparison between numerical and experimental results showed that the relative error was within twenty percent for more than eighty percent of measuring points. It may be concluded that the results of numerical simulation were reliable. Analyses of the maximum velocity of the up welling current, the maximum upwelling height, average velocity of the upwelling current and other parameters of the truncated-cone shaped artificial reef, single-bodied, immersed in the flow field, were comparable with those of pyramid, three-prism, porous square and square artificial reefs. We discussed and analyzed also the wake vortices of the truncated-cone shaped artificial reef. The generation and pattern of flow separation, upwelling and vortex development were observed as the water flows past the artificial reefs. It was found that this was a typical flow around a bluff body including complicate nonlinear procedure. The numerical results obtained showed that the maximum upwelling height was 2. 14[approximately]2. 17 times of the reef height; the maximum and average velocities of the upwelling current were 0. 76 and 0. 125 times of the incoming velocity, respectively; and the length of the back vortex region was about 2. 3 times of the reef height. In comparison with the other four types of artificial reefs including pyramid-shape, triangular prism and a square column with or without openings, it was found that the truncated-cone shaped artificial reef had a fairly good performance in most aspects of flow parameters. The wake vortices vary swiftly, which may lead to a complicated flow pattern in the wake of truncated-cone shaped artificial reef. It was expected that this type of artificial reef has a good prospect in the future application.",,,,,,,,,2,1,0,0,1,0,3,,,1672-5174,,,,,,,,,,,"Ocean Univ Chain, Coll Fisheries, Qingdao, 266003, China",,,,2017-02-23,ZOOREC:ZOOR15303016658,,

A total of 37 and 32 fish species were recorded over a period of 1 1/2 years at the concrete and tyre reefs respectively. The dominant fish families were Pomacentridae, Labridae, Chaetodontidae, Apogonidae, Gobiidae and Nemipteridae. The artificial reefs also serve as a nursery ground for some species (e.g. Neopomacentrus sp.) which are important primary consumers of algae on natural reefs. Greater numbers of 'target' (food-important) fishes were observed at the concrete reef while the tyre reef harboured more juveniles and smallersized adults.

A total of 6930 tagged cultured juvenile white seabreams (305 days old) were released in an artificial reefs (AR) area. Underwater visual census, sightings and recaptures were used as a source of data for estimating abundance and size of released fishes. The survey lasted 15 months and was carried out in artificial (AR, breakwaters and harbours) and natural (river mouths, rocky bottoms and Posidonia oceanica meadows) coastal habitats of the Gulf. A few days after the release, more than 90% of the tagged seabreams left AR and moved mainly towards harbours and breakwaters, which resulted to be particularly suitable for their settlement and growth. The recapture was 8.2% of the released stock. During the first days after releasing, the main ascertained sources of mortality were professional fishing (6.7%) and predation by conger eel, Conger conger (1.1%). A behavioural deficit of the ;reared seabreams in the use of refugia and food was observed in the initial period following the release. The results obtained provide some management suggestion for the feasibility of marine ranching initiatives involving hatchery-reared fishes. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V.

We developed an approach to estimate the statistical power of discrete survey events to identify species-specific hotspots and coldspots of long-term seabird abundance in marine environments. We illustrate our approach using historical seabird data from survey transects in the US. Atlantic Ocean Outer Continental Shelf (OCS), an area that has been divided into lease blocks for proposed offshore wind energy development. For our power analysis, we examined whether discrete lease blocks within the region could be defined as hotspots (3 x mean abundance in the OCS) or coldspots (1/3 x) for individual species within a given season. For each of 74 species/season combinations, we determined which of eight candidate statistical distributions (ranging in their degree of skewedness) best fit the count data. We then used the selected distribution and estimates of regional prevalence to calculate and map statistical power to detect hotspots and coldspots, and estimate the p-value from Monte Carlo significance tests that specific lease blocks are in fact hotspots or coldspots relative to regional average abundance. The power to detect species-specific hotspots was higher than that of coldspots for most species because species-specific prevalence was relatively low (mean: 0.111; SD: 0.110). The number of surveys required for adequate power (>0.6) was large for most species (tens to hundreds) using this hotspot definition. Regulators may need to accept higher proportional effect sizes, combine species into groups, and/or broaden the spatial scale by combining lease blocks in order to determine optimal placement of wind farms. Our power analysis approach provides a general framework for both retrospective analyses and future avian survey design and is applicable to a broad range of research and conservation problems.

In the case of wind generation, the kinetic energy stored in the machine rotor is not available to perform the natural task of frequency support for the AC power system. New active control methods must therefore be developed to synthetically recouple this inertia characteristic to the grid. European offshore windpower is growing and the average distance to shore is increasing. Voltage Source Converter based HVDC (VSC-HVDC) is a promising method for transporting this power to the onshore AC grid over long distances. The fast power transfer capability of VSC-HVDC offers the opportunity for new control strategies to provide frequency support to the AC grid. The authors propose a method for using a VSC-HVDC transmission link to follow and amplify the traditional primary frequency response behavior of a small synchronous generator connected at the point of common coupling (PCC). In terms of frequency support, the onshore grid will then see the HVDC connected offshore windfarm (OWF) and small synchronous generator together as one large synchronous generator with rotor inertia directly coupled to the grid (i.e. synthetic inertia). The method will therefore enable the OWF to provide frequency support services equivalent to that of a traditional power plant at the same rating. Electromagnetic transient simulation is used to investigate the proposed active control strategy. Fiber-optic technology is considered as a method of remote communication between the OWF and the small synchronous generator (SSG). A second communication-less method is also considered which utilizes a cascaded droop frequency to DC voltage control at the Grid Side VSC (GS-VSC) and then DC voltage to frequency at the Windfarm Side VSC (WF-VSC). Simulation results are used to justify the proposed method. (C) 2017 The Authors.

Functional group (FG) and their food resources of mobile organisms and epifauna in ARs area were investigated. There were three types of food resources and five FGs within two trophic levels in studied area. Particle organic matter (POM), seaweed detritus and sediment were considered to be the main food resources. The first three FGs were primary consumers and were mainly epifauna, while the other two FGs were secondary consumers. FG 1 species were filter feeders, and group 2 was all deposit feeders and A. japonicus was in this group. FG 2 contained few species and this indicated that A. japonicus had few food competitors. FG 3 contained most epifauna species which were detritus feeders and this result implied that the artificial oyster shell reed can retain detritus effectively. The food sources of group 4 were complex. Species of group 5, mostly fish, occupied the top trophic level and fed primarily on species of FG 1 and FG 2.

Studies were conducted to find out the relation between power density and operating parameters, such as operating temperature, fuel cell pressure, the relative humidity of anode, the relative humidity of cathode, porosity of gas diffusion electrode (GDE), conductivity of GDE. However, less focus was paid on determining the operating conditions which will maximize the power density of PEMFCs. The present work proposes the optimal design of a power density model for PEMFCs based on the artificial intelligence approach of support vector machine (SVM). The formulated power density model is in good agreement with the experimental data. Simulation profiler is then generated to verify its insensitivity to the variations in the operating conditions and the inferences on relationships between power density and operating parameters are investigated. The results show that the fuel cell pressure and conductivity of GDE are the two most dominant inputs in effective functioning of PEMFC. Optimization of the formulated model reveals that the operating temperature of 86.2 K, the fuel cell pressure of 3.44 atm, the relative humidity of anode of 50%, the relative humidity of cathode of 64.4%, the porosity of GED of 0.5 and the conductivity of GDE of 997.7 s/m gives the maximum power density value of 870 mW/cm(2) of PEMFC.

The effect of these two elements on the ecology of benthic organisms and marine biodiversity depends on facility siting, design characteristics of the facility construction methods and the receiving environment. While consideration is given to direct construction-related impacts, the biological consequence of the creation of new linear substrate on feeding, reproduction, predation, distribution and dispersal of benthic organisms has for the most part received little attention. This paper explores the potential for marine pipelines and cables to impact species movement and dispersal, habitat availability, boundary layer ecology, predation and the marine acoustic environment. Data are analyzed based on available literature, laboratory simulation, in situ field measurements and field inspection. Data from laboratory study suggests pipelines can act as barriers to the movement of some benthic species (e.g., crabs), an effect likely mediated by several biological and physical factors. The extent to which other residual ecological or hydrological barriers may occur is unclear. As a source of new hard substrate, pipelines are readily colonized by a variety of sessile marine organisms and so act as artificial reefs. During a reconnaissance of an exposed marine pipeline in temperate coastal waters of British Columbia, a minimum of 24 species of encrusting organisms and associated fish species were recorded. A case can be made that pipelines affect benthic communities through alteration of boundary layer processes, near bottom current dynamics and induced scour. Data obtained on pipeline noise and observed pipeline colonization by numerous benthic organisms suggest pipeline noise per se, is not a deterrent to certain invertebrate communities. The effect of electro magnetic radiation from cables is unresolved.

J,,,,,,,,,Xiandong Ma,,Intelligent and Integrated Condition Monitoring of Distributed Generation Systems,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Awarded Grant,Jan 16 2012,2012,"Distributed electricity generation (DG) will play a significant role in future electric power system, as this type of power generation technology can provide electric power by utilising a wide range of renewable energy sources at a site close to end users. Considerable advances have been achieved during past decades in the capacity, scale and location of DG systems, e.g. from onshore to offshore. One of the most critical challenges for the deployment of DG systems relates specifically to availability and reliability in order to sustain energy generation and maximise a long service life of the energy systems unattended. This has, therefore, placed higher demand on predictive maintenance from innovative condition monitoring systems and solutions to tackle new arising challenges in this area.The research proposed in this first grant scheme application represents an effort to explore key issues of generic importance to condition monitoring techniques optimised for fault detection and diagnosis. The research is oriented towards DG systems with wind turbines being the DG sources as this particular application presents a number of realistic challenges. Firstly, measurement signals would exhibit strong non-stationary behaviour due to the intermittent nature of wind sources and fluctuations of grid system. Secondly, the signals of small magnitude may indicate a start of a significant failure, which are normally undetected by conventional methods particularly in a harsh environment. Thirdly, large volume of data needs to be processed and transmitted especially for continuous online monitoring. For example, if we assume that 250 points are required for a typical 2 MW wind turbine to monitor most subsystems of a turbine, this will give rise to 36 million data per day for a 1 GW wind farm under a sampling rate of 5 minutes. Furthermore, a critical issue needing urgent attention will be the health problems of the sensor system, which requires that the monitoring techniques should be assessing what is happening when some of the sensors read data incorrectly.In order to meet such diversified requirements, we plan to use and apply windowed transform, a technique well known for its ability to extract nonstationary components in the measurement data. By the optimal selection of a window shape, automatic windowed wavelet transforms can be achieved to accommodate different sensor data for better feature localisation, extraction and correlation. Although an incipient fault signal is usually of low magnitude and short duration, it would essentially carry the same features as the large ones, such as the regularity. If we can design a suitable algorithm to match the local regularity or singularity of a signal, any incipient faults, abnormalities and disorders can be detected irrespective of their magnitude and time duration. The project is also concerned with designing a hybrid neuro-fuzzy method for optimal sensor data fusion. The use of this artificial intelligence method can best correlate sensor data and predict the unknowns by systematic incorporation of priori information. Minimising the number of sensors whilst still maintaining a sufficient number to assess the system's conditions can not only minimise the complexity of sensor systems but it can also reduce data storage requirements. The final part of the project relates specially to the practical aspect, where the proposed algorithms are validated in real time for online monitoring purposes on a modular embedded system. The proposed condition monitoring system in this project would accommodate all monitoring techniques within one hardware module, which can be readily adapted to other applications. The project will provide better sensing techniques and improved algorithms towards real applications by improving our understanding of how to engineer them in order to aid the decision making process with respect to asset maintenance and management of existing and future DG systems.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,EP/I037326/1,,,,,,,,Lancaster University,,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:15404610,,

At the request of the South Carolina Department of Natural Resources (SCDNR), one of these MPAs was established on an undeveloped sand-bottom area previously permitted by SCDNR for artificial reef development. After monitoring the production potential of unfished artificial reefs for several years on shallower experimental reef sites, SCDNR staff proposed that a deeper location had the potential to become a highly productive spawning site, particularly for deepwater grouper species. Development of this permitted site began in 2014 when two 79-m (260 ft) barges with nearly 30 m (100 ft) of added profile were deployed. Subsequent monitoring of the site through remotely operated underwater vehicle video revealed colonization by several target species, including Warsaw Grouper Hyporthodus nigritus, Snowy Grouper H. niveatus, and Misty Grouper H. mystacinus.

Yet, spatial and temporal heterogeneity can easily mask density dependence. By experimentally manipulating group sizes of the yellowhead wrasse Halichoeres garnoti on both natural and artificial reefs, I determined that the relationship between density and mortality varied with reef spatial structure. On natural reefs, mortality rates were highly variable among reefs. However, losses also resulted from emigration to neighboring patches, and thus persistence of fish remaining on natural reefs was approximately density-dependent. On artificial reefs, mortality was density-dependent on reefs that were spatially isolated, and high and density-independent on reefs that were aggregated. Emigration was virtually zero among these reefs. Overall predator visitation rates were significantly higher to artificial than natural reefs, but a greater diversity and size range of predators were present on natural reefs. Based on observations that yellowhead wrasse formed tighter aggregations in the presence of predators (rather than seeking shelter in the reef), differences between artificial and natural reefs were likely not related to differences in reef complexity. Instead, on artificial reefs, standardizing reef spacing resulted in density-dependent versus density-independent mortality according to reef isolation. In contrast, heterogeneity in reef spacing among natural reefs likely caused variation in predation risk that in turn caused high variability in mortality rates. Small-scale spatial variation in predation may play an important role in the population dynamics of species that occur within patchy environments.",,,,,,,,,35,0,0,0,34,1,36,,,0171-8630,1616-1599,,,,,,,,,,"Oregon State Univ, Dept Zool, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA",,,,2004-01-01,WOS:000223788100024,,

The reefs were then installed on an exposed rocky shore. To evaluate the feasibility of this seed-based surfgrass restoration technique, we monitored the seedling/shoot density and morphological characteristics of the shoots over a 2-year period. Seedlings began to emerge within the first month after seeding, reaching densities of up to 275.0 shoots m(-2) by April 2005. After an initial decline, shoot density increased through the production of lateral shoots, and densities of up to 997.1 shoots m(-2) were observed by the end of the experiment. Shoot height, the number of leaves, and leaf width rapidly increased during the first year after seeding, whereas the number of rhizome internodes and rhizome length rapidly increased during the second year.

Consequently, the flow phenomenon surrounding the artificial reefs and the related study of fish-attracting factors often draw the attention of marine ecologists and engineers. Knowledge about the flow pattern around the reefs can be obtained from different sources such as field observation, model experiment and numerical simulation. However, the performance analysis of artificial reefs by means of the field observation and experimental approach could cost much expenditure during the research.

Very unusual for a sea, the Baltic is almost entirely land-locked and the water exchange is very limited. Its special geographical, oceanographic, and climatological characteristics render the Baltic ecosystem highly susceptible to the environmental impacts of human activities at sea and in its catchment area, which is home to over 85 million people. The Baltic presents a challenging showcase of environmental management of a sea. No other sea so clearly demonstrates our mediocre performance in balancing the uses and the protection of natural marine resources. As depicted on the maps included in this report, the human pressures are so powerful that they are altering the marine ecosystem, depleting the renewable resources beyond safe biological limits, and jeopardizing the future uses of the Baltic ecosystem goods and services. Obviously, our environmental remedial measures so far have not been sufi cient to prevent the alarming ecosystem shift taking place today. However, tools have been developed to assess the state and find cost-efficient solutions to restore the marine ecosystem and improve its unacceptable status. Status This HELCOM Initial Holistic Assessment shows that the environmental status of the Baltic Sea is generally impaired (Chapter 2). None of the open basins of the Baltic Sea has an acceptable environmental status at present. The integrated assessment of the 'ecosystem health' has revealed that only very few coastal areas along the Gulf of Bothnia can be considered healthy. To reach the commonly agreed aim of a healthy Baltic Sea in 2021 at the latest, the Baltic Sea Action Plan urgently needs to be implemented to its full extent. Eutrophication, caused by nutrient pollution, is a major concern in most areas of the Baltic Sea. The Bothnian Bay and the northeastern parts of the Kattegat are the only open areas of the Baltic Sea not affected. The only coastal areas not affected by eutrophication are coni ned to the Gulf of Bothnia. Despite significant reductions of the nutrient inputs over the past, all other open basins and coastal waters are classii ed as 'areas affected by eutrophication'. HELCOM has been very successful in reducing the inputs of nitrogen and especially phosphorus to the Baltic Sea. During the decade from 1990 to 2000, the direct point-source inputs of phosphorus and nitrogen decreased by 68% and 60%, respectively. From 1990-2006, the total inputs to the Baltic Sea were reduced by 45% for phosphorus, but only 30% for nitrogen. For atmospheric nitrogen deposition, the picture is different: There was a much smaller decrease since the mid-1990s and an increase in the period from 2003 to 2007. Shipping in the Baltic Sea is an important contributor to the atmospheric nitrogen deposition, and will signii cantly increase in the future. Living organisms and bottom sediments are affected by hazardous substances in all parts of the Baltic Sea. Despite targeted abatement strategies, measures, and also signii cant reductions of inputs of hazardous substances, only very few coastal sites presently seem undisturbed by hazardous substances. At present, the key substances of concern include PCBs, heavy metals, TBT, dioxins, DDT/DDE, PAHs and alkylphenols. However, several management actions have proved to be successful, for example, reducing atmospheric inputs of mercury, lead, and cadmium, and reducing the inputs of certain persistent organic pollutants, such as DDT, PCBs and TBT, by banning their use in the Baltic Sea region. Concentrations of radioactive substances originating from the Chernobyl fallout are still high in the northern, eastern, and central parts of the Baltic Sea, but the concentrations of the radionuclide cesium- 137 are decreasing in all areas of the Baltic Sea. The status of biodiversity appears to be unsatisfactory in most parts of the Baltic Sea. According to the prelim- inary results of the biodiversity assessment, 82% of the coastal areas assessed exhibit an unfavourable status. Environmentally alarming shifts and unbalances appear in many habitats and at all levels of the food chain, particularly at the level of large i sh. Promising signs of successful remediation measures include an improvement in the status of top predators such as grey seals and white-tailed eagles during recent decades. The results of this HELCOM Initial Holistic Assessment are based on HELCOM's thematic assessments of the 'eutrophication status', the 'biodiversity status' and the 'hazardous substances status'. As an added value, these thematic assessments have been integrated to assess the 'ecosystem health', thereby setting a baseline for evaluating the effectiveness of the implementation of the HELCOM Baltic Sea Action Plan. Pressures For the first time in an assessment of a regional sea, all the relevant pressures and their impacts have been identii ed and ranked by a special index, the Baltic Sea Pressure Index and the Baltic Sea Impact Index (Chapter 3). The further development of the Baltic Sea Impact Index should be seen as a process in which the data layers and the index need to be continuously improved. Ultimately, the goal is to develop an index for decision support as well as solution targeting, which can take into account regional differences. Most prominently, the marine environment is under pressure by anthropogenic loads of nitrogen, phosphorus, organic matter, and hazardous substances. But commercial fishing is also a strong and widespread pressure, which severely impacts the Baltic Sea ecosystem. Especially bottom trawling is a very destructive fishing technique which affects large areas of the sea. The seabed is also disturbed by construction works, dredging and the disposal of dredged material, which can have large impacts on local marine environments. Comparing the pressures on a Baltic Sea-wide scale, it is obvious that pressures are high in the western, southern and eastern parts of the Baltic Sea. Coastal areas are affected mainly by pollution stemming from point sources as well as the disturbed seabed. The open-sea areas are mainly affected by i shing, riverine pollution, and atmospheric nitrogen deposition. It can be concluded that the cumulative impact of human activities is high in all areas except the open-sea areas of the Gulf of Bothnia. Pressures causing eutrophication are mainly related to inputs of nutrients from external sources, whether via water or air, and to a lesser extent internal sources such as sediments that have retained anthropogenic inputs from the past. Pressures causing contamination and pollution effects by hazardous substances are either related to the inputs of synthetic or natural compounds from external sources, whether via water or air, or to inputs from contaminated bottom sediments caused by physical disturbance of the seabed following, for example, construction activities, dredging or disposal of dredged material. Releases of oil to the marine environment represent a continuous pressure on the Baltic Sea. Releases of oil not only cause pollution effects, but can also directly harm biodiversity. For example, seabirds are highly susceptible to oil pollution. Pressures including the selective extraction of species by commercial i sheries and by hunting of seals and seabirds directly disturb biodiversity. The greatest concern in this respect relates to the elimination of top predators. Biodiversity is also impaired by numerous types of physical disturbances which take place in most, if not all, coastal zones and also in large areas of the open sea. These disturbances include smothering of benthic organisms from disposal of dredged materials, abrasion of the sea bottom caused by bottom trawling and dredging, and changes in salinity or temperature regimes. Underwater noise and marine litter are forms of physical disturbance which also have the potential to disturb life in the Baltic Sea, but with effects that are less well known. Solutions Solutions and associated actions to restore the health of the marine ecosystem are offered in Chapter 4. Solutions providing multiple positive effects are recommended for prioritization. Their cost-effectiveness can in many cases be increased through multiple positive effects. It is vital to reduce all types of anthropogenic pressures. The greatest emphasis should be placed on reducing nutrient inputs and the environmentally negative impact of fishing activities. Inputs of hazardous substances and oil pollution should be reduced as well. To prioritize actions in a targeted way, the spatially explicit status analyses regarding eutrophication, pollution by hazardous substances, and biodiversity need to be combined with the basin-wide ranking of pressures. However, getting the sub-basin priorities and actions right is one of the future challenges for implementing the ecosystem approach to the management of human activities. In addition, physical disturbance to habitats and species should be reduced, for exale, by planning, controlling and reducing construction activities, operation of maritime structures (such as wind farms, oil refineries or platforms), commercial bottom trawling and noise (from shipping, wind farms and other sources). Nature restoration is a useful, but currently not widely used, tool. For example, the re-establishment of the top levels of the marine food chains should be promoted by ensuring the recovery of the populations of cod, harbour porpoises, seals, predatory birds, as well as pike and pikeperch in the coastal areas. Natural habitats should be restored more widely, especially in areas where important or protected marine habitats have been lost. Nature restoration should not be restricted to the marine territory, but should also extend to coastal wet- lands, which provide indispensable ecosystem services by filtering out nutrients and potentially also hazardous substances, increasing biodiversity and enhancing sequestration of carbon dioxide. Furthermore, the restoration of river habitats, river water quality and their hydromorphology could contribute to reducing the flow of nutrients and hazardous substances into the Baltic Sea. At the same time, this would improve the state of the spawning populations of migratory fish. A key priority in this respect is the establishment of an ecologically coherent network of well-managed marine protected areas (MPAs). Coherence alone is not enough, especially if the management and enforcement of programmes of measures for MPAs are weak and restrictions on human activities poor. Banning or strictly regulating commercial i shing within MPAs should be the first step in the process of enhancing nature protection and restoring i sh stocks. The current governance issues, or rather lack of governance, should be addressed without delay and also linked to the upcoming implementation of maritime spatial planning. Noting that the Baltic Sea Action Plan is based on the ecosystem approach to the management of human activities, it should be evident that Baltic Sea Maritime Spatial Planning should apply the same principles, including the ecosystem approach as one of the main principles to ensure cross-sectoral policy integration as outlined in the EU Maritime Policy (Anon. 2007) and attaining good environmental status of the marine environment. Ecosystem goods and services Chapter 5 indicates that environmental gains are economic gains, too. The Baltic Sea provides us with many valuable services including transport, energy, food, mineral resources, recreational facilities and cultural heritage. Of the 24 marine ecosystem services identified in the Baltic Sea, only ten are operating properly and seven are under severe threat. The seven threatered ecosystem services are: the food web, biodiversity, habitats, Baltic Sea resilience (the capacity of the sea to resist and recover from disturbances), food, genetic resources, and aesthetic values. Eutrophication and overfishing have been identfii ed as the main threats to ecosystem services in the Baltic Sea. There are huge economic values at stake in the Baltic Sea today. From an economic perspective, we cannot afford to wait. Actions will be costly and constitute a severe challenge to the leadership skills of the Baltic Sea nations, but there is an undeniable risk that it will be much more costly not to take actions immediately, due to potentially serious effects on highly valuable ecosystem services.",,,,,,,,,11,0,0,0,6,0,11,,,0357-2994,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2010-01-01,ZOOREC:ZOOR14702016789,,

However, most users want to access wind in urban areas or near industrial units where the nature of the wind is more turbulent and swirling. Conventional designs do not work efficiently with the swirling, variable nature of wind at such sites. In this project Swift Energy present a radical re-design of a vertical axis wind turbine, with key technological improvements that will allow efficient operation in small-footprint, urban sites. Such sites have the added advantage that they are close to consumers, minimising transmission losses. WindSurf is a vertical axis, active pitching wind turbine. Swift's patented control technology uses servomotors to continually alter blade pitch, which allows self-starting in wind speeds as low as 3m/s, and optimised energy capture in free and turbulent wind streams. Edinburgh's role in this project is to produce an optimised design of the electrical generator for the WindSurf rated at 16kW, taking into account the environment in which it will be operating. A direct drive generator will be used to eliminate the gearbox, which will improve reliability and efficiency. Both of these contribute to LCOE: reliability through increased availability and reduced OPEX; and improved efficiency will enhance annual energy yield. An air-cored permanent magnet generator will be designed and built that is optimised for the structure of the Swift wind turbine. In order to achieve such an optimised design an integrated design approach is required, which links electromagnetic design, with structural design and thermo-fluid design. Edinburgh has built up 10 years of experience in the integrated design of direct drive permanent magnet air-cored generators for wind and marine renewable energy applications. Air-cored machines eliminate undesirable magnetic attraction forces that try to close the gap, and thus this topology benefits manufacture, assembly and structural design. A vertical axis wind turbine allows the electromagnetic design of the machine to have a large diameter, out near the blades. A large diameter will result in high airgap velocity and thus have a positive impact on torque density (Nm/kg), reducing the amount of active material, which is the most expensive part of the machine. A novel structural arrangement will be developed for integration into the turbine, which where possible makes best use of the existing structural material, again to minimise material usage and thus cost. A modular design approach will be adopted to ease manufacture and assembly of the generator, but also to make O&M easier. By positioning the generator close to the blades, we will investigate we will investigate methods of scooping air from the turbine onto the generator to assist with cooling. Effective cooling will benefit the torque density and the overall performance of the machine. Numerical modelling tools will be used in the design process, such as ANSYS for structural analysis, StarCCM for thermo-fluid analysis, and Infolytica for electromagnetic design. An existing analytical design tool will be refined based on the structural and CFD modelling in order to assist SWIFT in the future design and production of their turbine. Multi-body modelling using SIMPACK will be combined with structural modelling to investigate the impact of environmental loads on the generator in terms of airgap deflection. Once the design is finalised, the machine will be built under subcontract to Fountain Design Ltd, with whom we have worked in the past to build prototype generators. The machine will be tested at the University of Edinburgh on its wind-emulator test rig to verify performance and the design tools developed. A thorough integrated design approach with manufacturing and production techniques in mind supported by laboratory testing will ensure that SWIFT can move towards commercialisation.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,EP/P51147X/1,,,,,,,,University of Edinburgh,,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:15359323,,

The polymer matrix in these composites incorporates a fine dispersion of ion-exchange polymers for reducing the alkalinity of diffusing concrete pore water. Ion-exchange polymers are prepared by attaching polar groups to polymeric matrices; they are now produced at relatively low cost for use in filters and conditioners. The matrix incorporating ion-exchange polymers can feasibly act as a molecular sieve that removes alkali metal ions from the pore solution, and thus protects glass fibers against alkali attack. Preliminary analyses suggest that ion-exchange polymers possess the capacity, in the context of composite reinforcement in concrete, to lower the alkalinity of concrete pore water to levels that are not aggressive against glass fibers. Blending of conventional thermoset matrices of glass fiber composites with ion-exchange polymers promises to alter the favorable economics of glass fiber composites. This would facilitate large-scale introduction of composites as corrosion-proof and truly durable replacement for steel in concrete, noting that the relatively high cost of carbon and aramid fiber composites limit their potential for use as reinforcing bars in concrete. The resulting composites should meet the demands on concrete reinforcement in terms of mechanical performance, bond strength to concrete and cost, and should also be chemically and dimensionally stable in the alkaline environment of concrete under diverse exposure conditions. Potential commercial applications of the technology cover reinforced concrete systems subjected to corrosive environments, including bridge structures, parking ramps and offshore structures.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,60205,,,,,,,,DPD INC,DPD INC,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:13552782,,

This study presents a geo-located life cycle assessment of an emerging technology, namely, floating offshore wind farms. It is developed and applied to a pilot project in the Mediterranean Sea. The materials inventory is based on real data from suppliers and coupled to a parameterized model which exploits a geographic information system wind database to estimate electricity production. This multi-criteria assessment identified the extraction and transformation of materials as the main contributor to environmental impacts such as climate change (70% of the total 22.3 g CO2 eq/kWh), water use (73% of 6.7 L/kWh), and air quality (76% of 25.2 mg PM2.5/kWh), mainly because of the floater's manufacture. The results corroborate the low environmental impact of this emerging technology compared to other energy sources. The electricity production estimates, based on geo-located wind data, were found to be a critical component of the model that affects environmental performance. Sensitivity analyses highlighted the importance of the project's lifetime, which was the main parameter responsible for variations in the analyzed categories.

Inappropriate experimental designs have prevented many studies from discriminating between the two processes. Eight of 11 experiments comparing fish abundances on artificial reefs with those on adjacent soft bottom habitats were compromised by a lack of replication or spatial interspersion in the design itself. Only three studies featured proper controls and replicated designs with the interspersion of reef and control sites. Goodness of fit tests of abundance data for 67 species from these studies indicated that more fishes occur on reefs than on controls, particularly for species that typically occur over hard substrata. Conversely, seagrass specialists favour controls over reefs. Changes in the appearance of fish abundance trajectories driven by manipulation of sampling intervals highlight the need for adequate temporal sampling to encompass key life history events, particularly juvenile settlement. To ultimately determine whether attraction and production is responsible for increased abundances on reefs, requires two experimental features: 1) control sites, both interspersed among artificial reefs and at reef and non-reef locations outside the test area and 2) incorporation of fish age and length data over time. Techniques such as otolith microchemistry, telemetry and stable isotope analysis can be used to help resolve feeding and movement mechanisms driving attraction and production.

We investigated the spatial and temporal scale of behavioural responses of harbour porpoises Phocoena phocoena to construction noise using passive acoustic monitoring devices (T-PODs) deployed in a gradient sampling design. Porpoise acoustic activity was reduced by 100% during 1 h after pile driving and stayed below normal levels for 24 to 72 h at a distance of 2.6 km from the construction site. This period gradually decreased with increasing distance. A negative effect was detectable out to a mean distance of 17.8 km. At 22 km it was no longer apparent, instead, porpoise activity temporarily increased. Out to a distance of 4.7 km, the recovery time was longer than most pauses between pile driving events. Consequently, porpoise activity and possibly abundance were reduced over the entire 5 mo construction period. The behavioural response of harbour porpoises to pile driving lasted much longer than previously reported.

In the western Mediterranean basin, ARs have been developed since 1960 in France, Italy, Spain, Portugal, and Monaco. A large AR complex, composed of seven artificial reef systems, has been deployed in the Algarve (southern Portugal). It occupies an area of 43.5 km(2) of seabed with more than 20,950 modules weighing 73,000 metric tons (mt) and with a volume of 103,000 m(3). These ARs have successfully increased the fishing yield and diversified the catches. On the other hand, they increase biodiversity and epibenthic biomass, and have became an interesting recreational diving spot, as well as a site for research. Spain shows the more extensive reef-building activity in terms of number of reefs (103 in 2002) and seabed protected (550 km(2)). The armed modules (concrete cylinders or square blocks with four protruding iron spikes; 3-5 mt) used for anti-trawling are effective to prevent illegal fishing but poor in improving hard substrata and microhabitat availability. In France, 44,000 m(3) of concrete modules were deployed in 20 sites, equally distributed in the west and east coasts. Eight sites are off the western coast (Languedoc-Roussillon) to protect static fishing gears, longlines, and natural habitats from illegal trawling. Extensive colonization by oysters, fish, and lobsters on some reefs was reported. In some other ARs, more fish than in comparable natural reefs was found. Where small modules (1-2 m(3)) were placed in chaotic heaps of 50-100 m(3) or so, the greatest amount of fish was recorded. In Italy, ARs, made mainly of concrete perforated cubic blocks, were deployed in all the seas with different aims. But the best results in terms of harvestable yield were obtained in the middle Adriatic Sea, due to heavy settlement and fast growth of mollusks, in particular Mediterranean mussel Mytilus galloprovincialis. Within 4 years from deployment, the incomes of small-scale fisheries exceeded by three times the initial investment.",,,,,4th World Fisheries Congress4th World Fisheries Congress,"MAY 02-06, 2004MAY 02-06, 2004",,"Vancouver, CANADAVancouver, CANADA",3,0,0,0,3,1,3,,,0892-2284,,978-1-888569-80-3,,,,,,,,,"Univ Genoa, Lab Biol Marina Ecol Anim, I-16132 Genoa, ItalyNazl Res Ctr, Inst Res Maritime Fishing, I-60125 Ancona, ItalyIPIMAR, CRIPSul, PL-8700305 Olhao, PortugalUniv Islas Baleares, Palma de Mallorca, SpainParc Marin Cote Bleue Maison Mer, F-13960 Sausset Les Pins, France",Nazl Res CtrIPIMARParc Marin Cote Bleue Maison Mer,,,2008-01-01,WOS:000254264800075,,

During summer, southeasterly waves dominate, and northward longshore drift occurs. In addition, the southward transport of littoral sediment occurs under the northeasterly waves that are dominant during winter. However, recent changes in the coastal environment, due to the development of coastal flooding prevention facilities, harbor development projects, and unusual weather conditions, have shown a tendency to increase the erosion of coastal areas. In other words, there is a repeating cycle of positive feedback, in which structures introduced to prevent a certain kind of coastal erosion cause different kinds of coastal erosion. In this study, we used field survey data to analyze the behavioral characteristics of the Gangmun and Anmok beaches for a period of seven years. The results show that the Gangmun and the Anmok beaches are very vulnerable to the effects of artificial constructs. Coastal erosion on Gangmun beach occurred through northward sediment transportation, caused by a dike that was built to avoid the closure of the mouth of Gyungpo stream. After an artificial reef and the groin were constructed to solve this erosion problem, the coastline stabilized. In the case of the Anmok beach, an imbalance in the sand budget supplied from the Namdae stream was brought about by the expansion of the Gangneung harbor, leading to significant beach erosion. After artificial reefs were installed on both beaches to prevent erosion, the area of each beach was increased and each beach's status was stabilized, as a salient beach.",,,,,3rd International Water Safety Symposium (IWSS)3rd International Water Safety Symposium (IWSS),"JUN 19-23, 2018JUN 19-23, 2018",,"Incheon, SOUTH KOREAIncheon, SOUTH KOREA",2,0,0,0,0,0,2,,,0749-0208,1551-5036,,,,,,,,,,"Kangwon Natl Univ, Dept Earth & Environm Engn, Samcheok, South KoreaKangwon Natl Univ, Environm Tech Res Inst, Samcheok, South Korea",,,,2019-10-04,WOS:000485724400006,,

Epibiota was dominated by barnacles, filamentous and foliose algae and ranged in thickness from 4 to 11 mm. The two species of fishes that associated most closely with jetty pilings, Pandaka lidwilli (Gobiidae) and Monodactylus argenteus (Monodactylidae), were sampled twice during the day and twice during the night for analysis of stomach contents. During the day, the diet of P. lidwilli was dominated by amphipods (c. 70%, by mass of organic content), with copepods, bivalves and bryozoans each contributing < 10%. At night, amphipods contributed less (c. 45%) and copepods more (c. 35%). The diet of M. argenteus was dominated by filamentous algae (55%) and amphipods (20%) during the day and filamentous algae (70%) and barnacle cirri (23%) at night. Epibiota, therefore, made a substantial contribution to the diet of the fishes but were not the sole source of food for either species. As jetties were the only structures that supported epibiota in the area, fishes probably sourced their epibiota from the pilings of the jetties. Whether fishes depended on the epibiota was, therefore, tested using a manipulative before-after-control-impact (BACI) study. Three jetties were assigned randomly to each of three treatments: (1) epibiota removed from pilings, (2) epibiota cut and damaged (a procedural control) and (3) epibiota left undisturbed. Abundances of P. lidwilli and M. argenteus around jetty pilings remained similar across all treatments from before to after the removal of epibiota. These results indicate that although fishes consumed epibiota on the jetties, they did not depend on the epibiota of the jetties for food.

The objective of this study was to investigate drivers of seabird habitat selection within the Gulf of the Farallones and Cordell Bank National Marine Sanctuaries to identify areas for targeted conservation planning. We used seabird abundance data collected by the Applied California Current Ecosystem Studies Program (ACCESS) from 2004-2011. We used zero-inflated negative binomial regression to model species abundance and distribution as a function of near surface ocean water properties, distances to geographic features and oceanographic climate indices to identify patterns in foraging habitat selection. We evaluated seasonal, inter-annual and species-specific variability of at-sea distributions for the five most abundant seabirds nesting on the Farallon Islands: western gull (Larus occidentalis), common murre (Uria aalge), Cassin's auklet (Ptychorampus aleuticus), rhinoceros auklet (Cerorhinca monocerata) and Brandt's cormorant (Phalacrocorax penicillatus). The waters in the vicinity of Cordell Bank and the continental shelf east of the Farallon Islands emerged as persistent and highly selected foraging areas across all species. Further, we conducted a spatial prioritization exercise to optimize seabird conservation areas with and without considering impacts of current human activities. We explored three conservation scenarios where 10, 30 and 50 percent of highly selected, species-specific foraging areas would be conserved. We compared and contrasted results in relation to existing marine protected areas (MPAs) and the future alternative energy footprint identified by the California Ocean Uses Atlas. Our results show that the majority of highly selected seabird habitat lies outside of state MPAs where threats from shipping, oil spills, and offshore energy development remain. This analysis accentuates the need for innovative marine spatial planning efforts and provides a foundation on which to build more comprehensive zoning and management in California's National Marine Sanctuaries.",,,,,,,,,41,1,0,0,35,0,45,,,1932-6203,,,,,,,,,,,"San Francisco State Univ, Dept Geog, San Francisco, CA 94132 USAPoint Blue Conservat Sci, Petaluma, CA USA",Point Blue Conservat Sci,,,2013-08-13,WOS:000323115800057,23967206,

To begin a maintenance service, different types of relatively scarce servicemen need to be delivered (transported) to the service locations. We develop resource-exceeding route (RER) inequalities, which are inspired by knapsack cover inequalities, to model the scarcity of servicemen. In addition to a traditional separation approach, we present a column-dependent constraints approach so as to include the RER inequalities in the mathematical formulation. An alternative pricing strategy is developed to correctly include the column-dependent constraints. The resulting approach is broadly applicable to any routing problem that involves a set of scarce resources. We present a branch-and-price-and-cut algorithm to compare both approaches that include RER inequalities. The branch-and-price-and-cut algorithm relies on efficiently solving a new variant of the elementary resource-constrained shortest-path problem, using a tailored pulse algorithm developed specifically to solve it. Computational experiments show that the RER inequalities significantly tighten the root node relaxations. The column-dependent constraints approach then searches the branch-and-bound tree more effectively and appears to be competitive with the traditional separation procedure.

Although today all of the marine power projects are very near from the shore and they are rated at low power, the huge potential of the seas may in a not very distant future bring marine power further into the sea. Also offshore oil and gas exploration is moving into deeper waters and at longer distances from land. New carbon sequestration projects under the seabed are on the way which require a vast amount of electric power consumption. The substitution of offshore power generators by power provided from the grid may have environmental benefits, but the deployment of offshore transmission of bulk electrical power to or from offshore platforms to the electrical grid onshore is a mayor challenge. The main objective of this paper is to focus on trends that can lead to a feasible transmission system in offshore energy systems far from land, and to introduce the technological alternatives which could help to reach that goal.

We quantify the severity of this threat to archaeological sites through repeat visits to one ancient shipwreck and quantify the change to the seabed over a period of eleven months. The results illustrate the benefits of enforced areas of restricted bottom trawling (Marine Protected Areas) to the in situ preservation of shipwreck sites and to natural seabed features and benthic habitats.

J,,,,,,,,,Jennifer Loxton,,Marine Renewable Energy Directed KE Fellowship: Biofouling in the UK Marine Renewable Energy Industry,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Awarded Grant,Oct 02 2016,2016,"When man-made structures, such as marine renewable energy devices, are deployed in the sea they are quickly colonised by communities of organisms growing on exposed surfaces. This marine growth, or biofouling, is often unwanted from an engineering perspective and can have consequences for structural integrity, efficiency, maintenance and functioning of devices. Non-native species are also commonly found on man-made structures, making biofouling a potential biosecurity risk and a possible vector for species invasions. Factors such as the type of species in the biofouling community, the geographical location and the seasonality of organism settlement and growth lead to a high degree of variability in biofouling properties such as mass, thickness and texture. At the moment marine renewable energy SME's conduct most of their design, efficiency calculations and maintenance planning based on very basic figures for biofouling thickness which do not take into account variability. Technical standards acknowledge the limitations of existing guidance and recommend that whenever possible, site-specific measurements should be used. Unfortunately, due to the newness of the industry, this data is often not available and SMEs and engineers are working with little more than a best guess when calculating for the effects of marine growth on devices.Jen Loxton recently co-hosted a workshop which discussed biofouling on marine renewable energy devices with attendees spanning academia, regulatory bodies, and industry. Together this group identified 119 issues associated with biofouling with operational, financial or environmental impacts. A key priority which was identified to help solve many of these issues was improved knowledge exchange between science, engineering and marine industry. It was acknowledged that there is a lot of biofouling knowledge in the scientific and industrial communities but there is currently no pathway for getting this to the right people to inform renewable energy device design and maintenance decisions. It is this gap in communication which Jen aims to address in this KE project.During the fellowship Jen will develop and launch a comprehensive online resource which will consolidate biofouling science in an accessible and industry relevant format for the UK marine renewable energy community. This resource will consist of:- A website of biofouling knowledge, translated for industry- An interactive tool/app powered by a database of UK biofouling distribution and characteristicsThe website will provide a biofouling one-stop-shop for stakeholders associated with the UK marine renewable energy industry and help to inform engineering and operational decisions and increase awareness of potential environmental considerations. It is anticipated that it will increase the reach and impact of biofouling science.A comprehensive database will be populated with biofouling science and species distribution data and will power the interactive tool/app. A user would specify location, deployment type and available observations of biofouling and the tool will generate a tailored suite of industrially relevant statistics and possible management techniques. Full specifications for the tool will be determined during the fellowship but examples of possible outputs include maximum biomass, thickness and rugosity of fouling, expected seasonal variations and known non-native species in the vicinity. The database will continue to grow during the life of the fellowship and beyond through live links with UK databases (e.g. NBN gateway) and the addition of user specified biofouling observations.Information for the fellowship will be gathered from academia, regulatory bodies and from across the maritime industries, including oil & gas, shipping, leisure boating and the aquaculture industries. The fellow will include data from previous NERC projects (e.g. EBAO and FlowBec), expanding the impact of this research.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,NE/P006566/1,,,,,,,,University of the Highlands and Islands,University of the Highlands and Islands,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:15338110,,
J,,,,,,,,,Laurent Amoudry,,Multi-dimensional Intra-wave Modelling of coupled Sediment transport and Turbulence (MIMST),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Awarded Grant,Oct 04 2011,2011,"The movement of sediment is a key part of coastal dynamics and it has relevance to many physical, chemical, biological and ecological processes. Computer modelling approaches are an important tool for coastal zone management and to predict the response of coastal systems to changing environmental conditions. The models used must be grounded in sound physical understanding of sediment processes and offer proven predictive abilities. They can only be as good as the representation of the underlying physical processes, which is commonly blamed for the still limited predictive power of coastal-scale physically-based models. In particular, mixing near the sea bed greatly affects the transport of matter and a good description of near-bed turbulence is crucial to accurately describe sediment transport. The available evidence shows that near-bed turbulence is still poorly predicted for wave flows over ripples in coastal ocean models. The key issues are then to determine which processes are responsible for the poor predictions, and how they can be better represented. In the MIMST project, we propose to use computer modelling techniques to significantly increase our understanding of near-bed turbulence and sediment transport over rippled beds. We will combine computer simulations with rigorous comparisons against existing high-quality experimental data. This approach will enable us to develop and carefully validate a new coupled wave hydrodynamics, turbulence, and sediment transport model. The resulting model will be able to provide more information on small-scale turbulent and sediment processes than experiments presently can. In turn, we will use the new fine-scale numerical results to assess and improve the current representation of near-bed turbulence and sediment transport over rippled beds in coastal-scale models. By combining observations and advanced numerical modelling, the project will provide a firm scientific foundation for understanding complex unresolved physical processes occurring near the sea bed. It will allow better predictions of coastal responses to changes in environmental forcing. The project builds on studies of the interaction between wave hydrodynamics and structures, and it will then allow predictions of the impact of man-made structures on sediment dynamics, and vice versa.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,NE/J004499/1,,,,,,,,National Oceanography Centre,National Oceanography Centre,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:15319630,,

The complexification of some large reefs built with wide voide spaces called Bonna reefs appear to be a good solution to increase species richness and density. Species richness and density of the fish assemblages showed significant increase between 1988 and 1998. However the fast increasing was stopped from 1998 and 2008 probably due to a lack of law enforcement and poaching. Despite artificial reefs were deployed in MPA since at least 20 years, they did not show a real positive impact on fish assemblages. These results could be explained (i) by a lack of law enforcement patrol within the protected areas during the last decade, and (ii) by the one-year opening to fishing activities within MPA.

Artificial reefs (ARs) have been suggested as a tool for reef conservation and rehabilitation. Although successions of AR communities have been thoroughly studied, current understanding of the interactions between artificial and natural reefs (NRs) is poor and a fundamental question still to be answered is that of whether AR communities can mimic adjacent NR communities. We suggest three alternative hypotheses: Neighboring ARs and NRs will (1) achieve a similar community structure given sufficient time; (2) be similar only if they possess similar structural features; (3) always differ, regardless of age or structural features. We examined these hypotheses by comparing the community structure on a 119-year old shipwreck to a neighboring NR. Fouling organisms, including stony and soft corals, sponges, tunicates, sea anemones and hydrozoans were recorded and measured along belt transects. The ahermatypic stony coral Tubastrea mierantha dominated vertical AR regions while the soft corals Nephthea sp. and Xenia sp. dominated both artificial and natural horizontal surfaces. Our results support the second hypothesis, indicating that even after a century an AR will mimic its adjacent NR communities only if it possesses structural features similar to those of the natural surroundings. However, if the two differ structurally, their communities will remain distinct. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

Areas of practical application include coastal defense against tsunami inundation, harbor protection and erosion prevention with submerged breakwaters, and the construction and design of artificial reefs to use for recreational surfing. Three sea-floor configurations are considered: an underwater shelf, a flat sea-floor with a single obstacle, and a series of obstacles. A piecewise continuous coefficient is used to model the various sea-floor topographies. A simple and easily implementable numerical scheme using explicit finite difference methods is developed to solve the discontinuous partial differential equations. The numerical solutions are verified with the exact analytical solutions of linear wave propagation over an underwater shelf. The scope of this simplified approach is determined by comparison of its results to those of another numerical solution and wave transmission and reflection coefficients from experimental data available in the literature. The efficacy of approximating more complicated continuous underwater topographies by piecewise constant distributions is determined. As an application, a series of underwater obstacles is implemented. (c) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

Here at the Besh Barmag bottleneck in Azerbaijan an estimated 1.24-1.51 million migrants passed through in autumn 2011 and a further 0.65-0.82 million in spring 2012, elevating this bottleneck to international importance. Furthermore, 34 bird species were observed in numbers in excess of the 1% threshold of world or flyway population in at least one of the observation seasons. Due to the high concentration of these species, any dangers affecting this passage can be threatening at a population scale. This study therefore aims to describe the migratory behaviour of these 34 species and subsequently to identify the dangers involved in passage through the area. Collision with anthropogenic obstacles was regarded as the main threat in the coastal plain. Ten (40%) of the species studied and observed in autumn 2011 were flying at the lowest altitudes and are therefore under threat on migration through the bottleneck due to overhead power lines, buildings, traffic and hunting. Planned infrastructural developments with heights of up to 200 m (e.g. towers, wind farms) pose a future threat for an additional 13 (52%) of the study species observed in autumn, making a total of 23 species that would be threatened. Only two species, Pygmy Cormorant Microcarbo pygmaeus and Grey Heron Ardea cinerea, can be expected to maintain their currently safe passage in future as they migrate mainly above 200 m above ground level. In spring 2012, all 14 (100%) of the species that used the coastal plain as flyway, migrated below 50 m and are therefore imminently threatened by collision.

Reef plots differed in spacing of otherwise equivalent prefabricated concrete reef units. The plot with widely spaced reef units (uniform pattern, 60 m apart) consistently harbored more stone crabs (Menippe hybrids) and/or octopuses (Octopus vulgaris) than did plots with more aggregated reef units (i.e., a close uniform pattern, units 2 m apart, and a mixed pattern of clustered units, at least 60 m between clusters). Stone crab numbers declined markedly and approached zero as octopus occupancy reached maximum levels (61 animals per plot), suggestive of species interaction. Black sea bass (Centropristis striata melana) and gray triggerfish (Balistes capriscus) exhibited occupancy patterns qualitatively similar to stone crabs and octopuses. The widely spaced plot consistently harbored more sea bass (96-331 individuals) and triggerfish (2-39 individuals) than did the closely spaced plot (45-203 sea bass and 0-21 triggerfish per plot).

In this connection, the construction of artificial reefs (known as Acadja) for the development on substrates of living communities, and the utilization of this new production to enhance fish growth have been evaluated in Cote d'Ivoire. This paper describes the granulometric, chemical and biological transformation of the sedimentary ecosystem as a consequence of this practice. In the artificial habitat, an increase in the sedimentation rate of the mineral fraction (definitive trapping of particle resuspension generated by the waves and induced by the wind) and of the organic fraction (direct and indirect sedimentation of the epiphytic biomass) constitutes the starting point of significant modifications in epibenthic communities. In the Acadja, the meiofauna, dominated by nematodes and copepods, is somewhat less diversified, some groups being absent or poorly represented (turbellarians, gastrotrichs, ostracods). These characteristics were confirmed by a specific study of the nematode assemblages. In fact, the relatively high diversity of the nematode community in the natural lagoon sediment (dominated seasonally by Paraphanolaimus, Anonchus et Daptonema) contrasts with low diversity in the Acadja sediment, where the community is always dominated by Theristus sp. This lower specific diversity generates a reduction of the trophic types. In the Acadja, only the non-selective detritus feeders colonize the fine and organic sediment. These sedimentological and ecological transformations, which affect the entire ''brush park'' (Acadja), induce a strong eutrophication of the benthic ecosystem. Sustainable fish production in such tropical lagoons, in an environment where anaerobic processes dominate (especially sulfate-reduction), calls for strategic spatio-temporal planning to take of account of this progressive eutrophication.",,,,,,,,,28,0,0,0,18,1,31,,,0399-1784,,,,,,,,,,,"MUSEUM NATL HIST NAT,CNRS D0699,F-75231 PARIS 05,FRANCE",,,,1995-01-01,WOS:A1995TV59000005,,
J,,,,,,,,,,,Acoustic Identication of Marine Cetaceans using Deep Learning Techniques,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Awarded Grant,Sep 30 2017,2017,"Modelling cetacean (dolphins, whales and porpoises) dynamics and behaviour is paramount to effective population management and conservation. Robust data is required for the design and implementation of conservation strategies and to assess risk presented by anthropogenic (man-made) activity such as offshore wind turbines and fishing. Moreover, cetaceans make prime candidates for modelling ecosystem change under the ecosystem sentinel concept as they reflect the current state of the ecosystem and respond to change across different spatial and temporal scales. As global climate changes and urbanisation of coastal areas intensies, it is imperative to develop methodologies for quick and effective assessment of the biological and ecological impact of rising sea temperatures, pollution and habitat degradation. This can be achieved through modelling the population, behaviour and health of large marine species such as dolphins.Methodologies of cetacean research include passive acoustic monitoring (PAM). Deployed PAM is less expensive and labour intensive compared to other marine mammal methodologies and can record data over long temporal scales. For dolphins, this is limited to the monitoring of echolocation clicks and some species identification using the whistles they produce, unable to identify individuals within a species and difference between certain species (such as bottlenose and white-beaked dolphins). The research will addresses these limitations by applying the methodologies and techniques of deep learning to the field of marine biology, mainly focusing on image analysis techniques. Methodologies will be designed to quickly identify individuals, analyse behaviour and incorporate remote sensing techniques. From these identifications estimations of group size will also be made. A statistical framework will be developed, which can be incorporated into PAM systems, to monitor species and individual occurrence over long spatial scales.Data collection will focus on a population of white-beaked dolphins (WBD) off the coast of North-East England. Recent research has identified sites where the species is regularly sighted and has shown seasonal and multi-year residency. A health assessment identified high incidence of skin disease and trauma suggesting conservation of this population should be high priority. Moreover, there has been recent evidence of this species producing unique whistles, however more evidence is needed, which this research will provide.The research will develop novel acoustic analysis algorithms which can be deployed on small low-cost Linux based computers, to be taken into the field to perform analyses in real time. These algorithms will be developed to work on both visualised and raw acoustic data collected from WBD, consisting primarily of whistles. The process for initial data collection has already begun using hydrophones to record dolphin vocalisations during expeditions off the coast of the North-East England. Initial visualisation of acoustic recordings have also begun, but experimentation with depth and distance from vessel placement of hydrophones are needed. The research will develop a novel method and statistical framework using deep learning models for acoustic analysis. This objective will be evaluated by testing the trained algorithm at successfully identifying group size or individuals from acoustic recordings.Another aim of the research is to assess the effect of anthropogenic activity on cetaceans, mainly wind turbines and boats. There is a large collection of wind turbines off the coast of Blyth where the collection of WBD and other cetaceans habitat. There has been no studies of how the noise pollution from these turbines affect the population but recent research has shown trauma to the white-beaked dolphins suggesting this could be a possible cause.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,1948773,,,,,,,,Newcastle University,,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:15510821,,

Across the sampling period and at the impacted site the cover of brown turfing algae increased significantly by 87%.

Systems are currently designed using a mixture of local and international standards such that they can withstand conditions with a sufficient margin of safety. Flexible pipes have been installed for water depth exceeding 2500m. The application of reliability methods to determine the design of offshore systems such as jackets and ship hulls is well developed and has a long and successful track record. Flexible risers are subjected to the same random environmental loads. While probabilistic methods have been explored, they have yet to be applied in any meaningful manner to the fatigue limit state.How to account in the most robust manner for uncertainties within the loading has become critical for deriving cost effective and robust design rules for flexible risers. Especially the layer of the flexible riser bearing the tensile load, named tensile armours, is critical in the design in many of the deep-water developments. In this paper, multiple structures designed for west of Africa and the North Sea are investigated through a reliability method. Typical Uncertainties within the global riser motions, the local stress computations and in the stress-life curve resistance are accounted for. Demonstration is made that for the same uncertainties the variables influencing the reliability of the structure differ. Finally, the comparison with actual international design rules is made through the value of the safety factor applied on the design life. (C) 2018 The Authors.

The ever increasing numbers of people near the coast leads to higher demand for recreational opportunities in these coastal areas. One very popular activity is SCUBA diving and ecotourism. Divers have consistently shown they enjoy diving on artificial reefs with a preference for sunken vessels. These artificial reef types have been shown to harbor a wide variety and large numbers of fishes. However, these fishes are susceptible to heavy fishing pressure and a conflict exists between fishers who would like to harvest its resources and ecotourists who prefer to observe and photograph these fishes.

The proposed research addresses the development of key knowledge, experimentally-validated numerical models for combined aerolastic/hydrodynamic loadings; and an enabling technology, Rapid-Formed Composite Structures (RFCS). Neither the knowledge nor the technology currently exists for deepwater offshore wind turbines and both are critical to the development of offshore wind energy. The University of Maine brings to the partnership RFCS technology, which eliminates and will significantly reduce, platform construction and deployment costs. . The project addresses the energy crisis facing Maine and the US which requires new strategies and innovations. Working with floating platform developers and composites manufacturers, platforms for offshore floating turbines will be developed by the Advanced Structures and Composites Center (newly renamed in response to the evolution of its research mission) at the University of Maine. Thus, this project presents an opportunity to progress toward the goal of delivering installed wind power capacity at a cost that is competitive with existing technology. Floating offshore wind platform technology offers the following benefits: 1) reduction of reliance on foreign energy sources, (2) development of a renewable, carbon-free energy, and 3) creation of domestic manufacturing and service jobs focused on offshore wind energy.

Topographic characterizations and surveys of invertebrates and fishes were performed in November and December 2005, using SCUBA diving. A non-parametric multivariate analysis was used to analyze the environmental and biological data. The reefs were mainly distinguished by their depth and the position of the substrate. The red calcareous algae, Corallina officinalis, dominated the shallowest NR, whereas conspicuous mytilid assemblages of Mytilus platensis were present at depths over 3 m, sea anemones, Anthothoe chilensis, were more abundant between 6 and 10 m, and the soft coral, Tripalea clavaria, was found at nearly 20 m depth. No differences were found between horizontal ARs and the adjacent NRs. The greatest differences were found between the communities of vertical and horizontal substrates, both in NRs and ARs.

The harm typically associated with attraction is that fish will be easier to harvest due to the existing biomass aggregating at a newly deployed reef. This outcome of fish attraction has not progressed past an anecdotal form, however, and is always perceived as a harmful process. We present a numerical model that simulates the effect that a redistributed fish biomass, due to an artificial reef, has on fishing catch per unit effort (CPUE). This model can be used to identify the scenarios (in terms of reef, fish, and harvest characteristics) that pose the most risk of exploitation due to fish attraction. The properties of this model were compared to the long-standing predictions by Bohnsack (1989) on the factors that increase the risk or the harm of attraction. Simulations revealed that attraction is not always harmful because it does not always increase maximum fish density. Rather, attraction sometimes disperses existing fish biomass making them harder to catch. Some attraction can be ideal, with CPUE lowest when attraction leads to an equal distribution of biomass between natural and artificial reefs. Simulations also showed that the outcomes from attraction depend on the characteristics of the target fish species, such that transient or pelagic species are often at more risk of harmful attraction than resident species. Our findings generally agree with Bohnsack's predictions, although we recommend distinguishing mobility and fidelity when identifying species most at risk from attraction, as these traits had great influence on patterns of harvest of attracted fish biomass.",,,,,,,,,37,4,0,0,27,0,44,,,2045-7758,,,,,,,,,,,"Univ New S Wales, Evolut & Ecol Res Ctr, Sydney, NSW 2052, AustraliaUniv New S Wales, Sch Biol Earth & Environm Sci, Sydney, NSW 2052, AustraliaSydney Inst Marine Sci, Mosman, NSW 2088, AustraliaPort Stephens Fisheries Inst, Nelson Bay, NSW 2315, Australia",,,,2015-10-01,WOS:000363731500009,26668725,

The monitoring strategy to be proposed will be designed to be applied in the context of a wind farm, using optimized instrumentation layouts at a subgroup of WTs and taking profit from the data provided by the acquisition systems already available in all the WTs (the SCADA system that characterizes the wind at each WT and its operation parameters) for the use of extrapolation techniques to assess all the WTs of the same wind farm.The research project will include the simultaneous monitoring of 3 WTs of an onshore wind farm, comprehending accelerometers, strain gages and clinometers, distributed in the blades, tower and foundation, and the development of numerical models for the generation of artificial experimental data for floating WTs.The data processing will be based on the continuous evaluation of the parameters that drive the structure dynamic behaviour (vibration frequencies and damping) estimated from the structure response to ambient excitation (wind, waves, currents, soil vibrations) and advanced statistical modelling, having in mind two main goals: detection of stiffness reductions motivated by the appearance of damage and evaluation of the remaining fatigue life of the main structural components.The project team will include researchers from the Laboratory of Vibrations and Monitoring of FEUP (ViBest), well known at international level due to its research in Dynamic Testing and Structural Monitoring, from INEGI (an interface institute of FEUP), with a large experience on blades structural monitoring, and from WAVEC, with strong expertise on the numerical modelling of floating WTs.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,PTDC/ECI-EST/29558/2017,,,,,,,,Universidade do Porto,,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:15425301,,

Particularly, the NAO signature on the solar/wind energy resources was found to be a north-south dipolar pattern, with the positive/negative centre over the Mediterranean area. Although the spatial patterns obtained are similar, the nature of the relationship obtained for wind energy was found to be less linear and more complex than that attained for solar energy. A composite analysis revealed that interannual variability of the solar and wind energy resources in the Mediterranean area can reach values above 20% in winter and 10% in the annual case associated with changes in the NAO phase.

Scour is the erosion of the seabed caused by moving water such as those commonly experienced in offshore environments where the sea currents / waves cause sandy seabeds to become eroded around offshore wind turbine foundations and other assets such as subsea cables, etc.SISProtect will provide a cost effective and long term (permanent) solution for this issue which can cost the offshore wind industry significantly if suitable measures are not taken, resulting in higher costs of energy from the offshore wind farm installations.The SSCS Frond Mat system, which are mats of 'artificial seaweed' provides cost, H&S, and environmental benefits whilst providing robust scour protection. This is achieved through: A cost effective scour protection system engineered and installed to the foundation within the safety and security of an onshore facility; improved deployment times when compared with existing solutions; the system requires no ongoing maintenance in contrast to rocks and other 'conventional' methods; no need for large heavy lift / rock dumping vessels thereby reducing diesel usage and opportunities for H&S issues offshore; the environment by utilising environmentally accepted materials to recreate natures method of scour prevention.Whilst frond mat concept has been field proven in the Oil and Gas sector in water depths of up to and over 100m, it has not been possible to date to model and adapt the Mats deployment methodology specifically for offshore wind farm turbine foundations without an opportunity such as the one being offered by this project.The main consideration for this project is the innovative deployment system, developed by SPT Offshore, that would be incorporated with the foundation during construction and would automatically deploy the Frond Mats during foundation installation. This self-deployment system would therefore eliminate the need for separate offshore operations to install scour protection resulting in significant cost savings, as well as reducing the HSE impact associated with offshore operations. A specific deployment system will be developed to achieve this, along with Frond Mats designed and manufactured to suit the system. Successful completion will see a globally unique solution developed in the UK capable of saving £150-200m for project in the UK alone, comfortably allowing estimating savings in the £billions globally.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,104364,,,,,,,,Seabed Scour Control Systems Limited,Seabed Scour Control Systems Limited,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:15388338,,

Sediment features and meiofaunal variables were altered by the relocation, especially in the areas colonized by seagrass meadows. Results presented here pointed out to an enrichment in organic matter, the loss of two sensitive taxa (Cumacea and Ostracoda) and a shift in the assemblage structure with the increase of the relevance of Copepoda and Polychaeta.

First, the objectives of AR projects in the Southeast Asia can be classified into three, i.e. protection and increase of fishery resources, local community's profits, and ecological tourism. Second, fish gathering effects by ARs can be determined in terms of wake region or wake length that tends to increase with the K-C (Keulegan-Carpenter) number. Third, ARs are desirable to deploy across a direction of the main flow but it is essential to keep the deployment interval two to four times the length of a single reef. Fourth, stability of ARs depends on how to evaluate drag coefficient, and Morison formula turns out to be practical. Fifth, local scours of ARs are likely to occur due to a downward flow around the center of the front surface. Finally, it is natural for ARs to positively contribute to the marine ecosystem but it is imperative to develop an evaluation method for the effects of ARs on the marine ecosystem.",,,,,,,,,3,1,0,0,1,0,4,,,1229-8999,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2016-09-08,KJD:ART002121047,,

We use the Portuguese example to address marine EIA legislation since its exclusive economic zone (EEZ) is currently the third largest in the European Union and its EIA legislation does not require various offshore activities with potentially negative environmental impacts to undergo EIA before being licensed. This paper aims to determine whether three types of projects implemented within Portuguese maritime zones - artificial reefs using sunken ships, hydrocarbon prospecting and wave-energy generation - would benefit from application of an appropriately designed EIA. We have conducted a structured review of EIA legal provisions from seven other countries, and considered whether a full EIA was required for each project type. Consequently, 12 Environmental Impact Statements (EIS) have been compared to identify patterns of (dis)similarity across countries and project types. Additionally, we identified key descriptors and predicted impacts for each project type referred to in their EIS. The main conclusion is that ultimately all three projects would benefit from mandatory EIA in Portugal. This paper is relevant for countries with large maritime areas and underdeveloped marine EIA legislation, helping improve international policy-making relating to these three types of marine projects.

Therefore, we propose a competition graph model of coral fish populations and fish-dependent coral reef resources. Then, a big data graph query method based on Local Sensitive Hashing (LSH) is proposed to analyze the competitive pressure of fish populations and obtain real-time competitive pressure of fish populations.

We found that reef blocks with greater area and number of holes possessed the greatest fish species richness and abundance. Reef blocks with greater complexity had higher abundance of almost 30% of fish species present. Natural reef (NR) and AR were different in their fish species composition, trophic structure and categories of water column occupancy by fish (spatial categories). Although NR was more diverse and harboured more trophic levels. AR presented the higher abundances and the presence of distinct fish species that underlined their importance at a regional scale.

Shannon's diversity index (H') and Pielou's evenness (J') did not allow us to reject the null hypothesis that reefs do not enhance overall diversity, but we did reject this hypothesis on the basis of substantial differences in community composition: of the 107 species collected, 69 were found at both reefs and control sites, but 26 were only found at reefs and 12 only at control sites. The unique species at reef sites were mainly those of low abundance, and which therefore had relatively little effect on the composite diversity indices. These were mainly species that do not migrate out of the lake as part of the life cycle and use the flooded forest as refuge from predators, so the seasonal unavailability of the flooded forest habitat during the dry hydrologic phase probably keeps their populations at low density. Artificial reefs may therefore function to buffer rare and non-migratory species from local extinction in times of drought, and should be considered in efforts to preserve aquatic biodiversity.

The methods employed incorporate six basic steps designed to resolve multiple-use conflicts that might otherwise arise with daily industry and commercial fishery operations, and to identify and assess both geological and technological constraints that could affect placement of the structures. These steps include: (1) exclusion mapping, (2) establishment of artificial reef planning areas; (3) database compilation; (4) assessment and interpretation of database; (5) mapping of geological and man-made features within each proposed reef site; and (6) site selection.Nautical charts, bathymetric maps, and offshore oil and gas maps were used for exclusion mapping, and to select nine regional planning areas. Pipeline maps were acquired from federal agencies and private industry to determine their general locations within each planning area, and to establish exclusion fairways along each pipeline route.Approximately 1600 line kilometers of high-resolution geophysical data collected by federal agencies and private industry was acquired for the nine planning areas. These data were interpreted to determine the nature and extent of near-surface geologic features that could affect placement of the structures. Seismic reflection patterns were also characterized to evaluate near-bottom sedimentation processes in the vicinity of each reef site. Geotechnical borings were used to determine the lithological and physical properties of the sediment, and for correlation with the geophysical data.Since 1987, five sites containing 10 obsolete production platforms have been selected on the Louisiana OCS using these procedures.

In the event of partial removal of platform structure, fish assemblages on decommissioned platforms may remain unchanged in areas where structure is left intact. However, on the seafloor beneath the platforms, a mound of debris often called the shell mound will likely change over time if the supply of falling mussels and other organisms from the productive surface part of the structure is removed. In this study, we review shell mound research relevant to decommissioning, including mound formation, contaminant loads, associated biological communities, and transitions following the removal of platform structures at four sites.

We analyse a recent initiative to establish human-made reefs inside Marine Special Areas in Hong Kong. Simulations commence with a static mass-balanced model of trophic flows among he functional groups of an ecosystem (ECOPATH), which is then used to structure dynamic simulations of the biomass fluxes in response to fishing (ECOSIM). Spatial modelling is achieved through definition of dispersion, foraging, and predator avoidance parameters for each group in relation to a range of defined habitats (ECOSPACE). The ecosystem model comprised 27 functional groups and 7 sectors of the Hong Kong fishery, which were assumed to increase their catching power by 3% year(-1). Seven fishery sectors and gear types are defined, and their operations are simulated spatially to maximize operating profit within the areas where they are allowed to fish. Parameters for ECOPATH, ECOSIM, fishery, and habitats were obtained from recent surveys and assessments. Additional parameter values were obtained from meta-analyses and other literature on fishes of the South China Sea. More than 250 fish species were assigned to reef-associated and non-reef-associated functional groups with the help of an expert consultation. Results express average spatial responses to fishing and protected reefs. First, ECOSPACE was used to evaluate biomass responses and catch returns from a range of artificial reefs/marine protected area complexes in which size, perimeter, and corridor design were varied according to biogeographical theory. Benefits that might be deliberately forgone to obtain the cooperation of fishers by allowing them to fish designated reefs were also estimated. Secondly, five specific policy scenarios were evaluated using a spatial map of Hong Kong waters. Gains and losses to different fishery sectors were tracked, along with shifts in the species composition of the catches. While small protected areas with human-made reefs achieve little to avert collapse of the fisheries or a shift towards catches of low-value species, larger protected areas can do much to restore valuable fisheries for reef-associated fish. Precise results, but not the overall patterns, are sensitive to uncertainties in many model parameters. (C) 2002 International Council for the Exploration of the Sea.

Quantifying the response of mobile consumers to changes in habitat availability is essential for determining the degree to which population-level productivity is habitat limited rather than regulated by other, potentially density-independent factors.2. Over landscape scales, this can be explored by monitoring changes in density and foraging as habitat availability varies. As habitat availability increases, densities may: (1) decrease (unit-area production decreases; weak habitat limitation); (2) remain stable (unit-area production remains stable; habitat limitation) or (3) increase (unit-area production increases; strong habitat limitation).3. We tested the response of mobile estuarine consumers over 5months to changes in habitat availability in situ by comparing densities and feeding rates on artificial reefs that were or were not adjacent to neighbouring artificial reefs or nearby natural reefs.4. Using either constructed or natural reefs to manipulate habitat availability, we documented threefold density decreases among juvenile stone crabs as habitat increased (i.e. weak habitat imitation). However, for adult stone crabs, density remained stable across treatments, demonstrating that habitat limitation presents a bottleneck in this species' later life history. Oyster toadfish densities also did not change with increasing habitat availability (i.e. habitat limitation), but densities of other cryptic fishes decreased as habitat availability increased (i.e. weak limitation). Feeding and abundance data suggested that some mobile fishes experience habitat limitation, or, potentially in one case, strong limitation across our habitat manipulations.5. These findings of significant, community-level habitat limitation provide insight into how global declines in structurally complex estuarine habitats may have reduced the fishery production of coastal ecosystems.",,,,,,,,,3,0,0,0,3,0,5,,,0021-8790,1365-2656,,,,,,,,,,"Univ North Carolina Chapel Hill, Inst Marine Sci, Morehead, KY 27599 USANortheastern Univ, Ctr Marine Sci, Nahant, MA 01908 USACNMI Div Coastal Resources Management, MP 96950, Saipan, CM 32611 USA",Univ North Carolina Chapel HillCNMI Div Coastal Resources Management,,,2017-11-19,WOS:000413406700012,28833089,

Sediment cores and settled particles were collected to determine grain size, organic and inorganic carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus content. Overlying water and pore water samples were analysed for ammonium, nitrite, nitrate, phosphate, silicate, dissolved organic nitrogen, dissolved organic phosphorus and chlorophyll a. Results from the period studied showed that: (1) the benthic export of dissolved N, P and Si was 2-3 times higher at AR; (2) the particulate organic carbon (POC), nitrogen (PON) and phosphorus (POP) in suspended/settled particles were about 1.5 times higher at AR; (3) at both AR and NRA, the benthic export of dissolved N, P and Si, during a calm weather period, was 2-4 times higher than during or immediately after a storm event; and (4) at both sites, particulate organic compounds (POC, PON and POP) increased about 20 times during a storm event.

Bridging the gap between free-fall instruments and frame-based CPT,,,,,,,,OCEANS 2011,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Proceedings Paper,2011,2011,"Physical and geotechnical parameters of marine sediments are of vital interest to fields like foundation-planning of offshore structures, surveying of cable routes, sediment dynamics, sediment manipulation (dredging, plowing), ground-truthing of acoustical surveys, risk assessment and mine burial predictions. Therefore, characterization of geotechnical in-situ parameters with dynamic penetrometers is of interest for research, consulting and the offshore industry, because in-situ methods, and especially dynamic tests, are generally less time consuming than static tests or measurements on samples. In addition, recovery of sediment samples from the seafloor may alter the sediment characteristics (pressure decrease, temperature change) and limits the information value. To date, the determination of fundamental parameters like shear strength, bearing capacity or grain size is predominantly done ex-situ. However, in-situ assessment of these parameters leads to a better characterization of marine sediments due to direct measurement under field conditions.In this paper, we present the technical specifications and performance of a newly developed dynamic penetrometer. The penetrometer, named Lance Insertion Retardation Meter (LIRmeter), is a winch-lowered device which can be used in a pogo-style fashion to make multi-penetration measurements. The observed parameter is the deceleration during penetration. The probe consists of a lance of four meter length equipped with electronics to record the deceleration during penetration, and is aimed to bridge the gap between lightweight free-falling systems and sophisticated static CPT. The LIRmeter weighs about 400 kg in water and can achieve penetration depths up to four meters in cohesive sediments in its current configuration.Signals from analog MEMS-acceleration sensors of different ranges of 1.7, 3.5 and 6 g are converted using a 16-bit/16-channel ADC. Data is sampled at rates of typically 500 Hz per channel assuring a high data-density even at short penetrations. Ambient pressure, inclination and temperature are also recorded as secondary parameters. Power supply is provided by a 20 Ah Lithium-Polymer battery, allowing an operation time of 14 h. Charging of the battery takes about four hours. Data acquisition, as well as communication is controlled by a rugged, low-power industrial PC/104-system running GNU/Linux. Charging and communication can be done without needing to open the pressure case. Data can be downloaded via ethernet-interfaces. The recorded time-series of deceleration during sea-floor penetrations can be integrated once and twice to obtain time series of velocity and penetration depth. Thus, a relationship between deceleration and penetration depth can be established. The justification for this approach is provided by a common and well-accepted premise that stiff to hard sediments cause a high deceleration during penetration, whereas soft sediments lead to lower peak deceleration of a probe during penetration. By using state-of-the-art methods, geotechnical parameters can be deducted from this relationship, and estimates on grain-size can be made.Calculating sediment-physical and geotechnical parameters from deceleration measurements is not yet common, but represents an up-and-coming field of research. Different approaches (momentum-based, empirical relations and numerical experiments) exist and have mainly been adopted for lightweight free-falling penetrometers in the context of sediment mobilization and burial predictions. Some of the theoretical approaches appear to be suitable for penetrometers like the LIRmeter. Here, we show results of an adaptation of these approaches.Data were collected in (a) the eastern part of the German Bight (North Sea) and (b) the western part of the German Bight. The variety of sediment types ranges from muddy sediments to sandy sediments with different grain sizes and a varying amount of mud. The deceleration of the probe is in the range of about 3 m/s(2) for deep-sea ooze, 10-20 m/s(2) for sediments with a higher amount of mud and over 35 m/s(2) for sandy sediments. Samples of these sediments were taken and analyzed with respect to grain-size in the laboratory. Supplemental information has been provided by the German North Sea geoscientific database Geopotenzial Deutsche Nordsee (GPDN).The system has proven failsafe operation, regardless of the regime, soil and weather. These conditions ranged from shallow seas to ocean depth (in other surveys), from gravel to deep-sea ooze and from calm to stormy seas. The first deployments show excellent data quality and operational performance of the LIRmeter. It can be observed that the achieved penetration depth is affected by the amount of mud content in the sediment. A high amount of mud leads to deeper penetration of the probe. Especially the research areas in the North Sea show a high variability in mud-content. Hence, special attention is paid on these sediments. Results of different approaches are presented and discussed in context of grain-size and measurements with other penetrometers.",,,,,MTS/IEEE OCEANS ConferenceMTS/IEEE OCEANS Conference,"SEP 19-22, 2011SEP 19-22, 2011",Marine Technol Soc (MTS); IEEE; OESMarine Technol Soc (MTS); IEEE; OES,"Kona, HIKona, HI",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,978-0-933957-39-8,,,,,,,,,"Univ Bremen, Fac Geosci Marine Tech & Sensors, D-28359 Bremen, GermanyMarum Ctr Marine Environm Sci, Bremen, GermanyForschungsanstalt Bundeswehr Wasserschall & Geoph, Kiel, Germany",Forschungsanstalt Bundeswehr Wasserschall & Geoph,,,2011-01-01,WOS:000299005800079,,

The project offers the social science community an opportunity to collect survey data from a representative sample of the German population. Submitted study proposals are evaluated based on a scientific review process. Panel members were initially recruited in 2013 in face-to-face interviews followed by a self-administered profile survey. The mode was chosen by the participants. All participants of the profile survey are considered as members of the panel and invited to the bi-monthly regular waves. The starting cohort encompassed 4900 panelists at the beginning of 2014. In order to compensate for panel attrition, a refreshment sample was drawn in 2016, using the General Social Survey (ALLBUS) interview as vehicle. The initial cohort encompasses German speaking respondents aged between 18 and 70 years (at the time of recruitment) and permanently residing in Germany, whereas the second cohort includes respondents from the age of 18 without upper restriction. The ALLBUS Sample is based on a disproportional sampling of respondents from the western and eastern part of Germany. A design weight that enables integration of the two recruitment cohorts is included into the dataset. For more details, please see the methods reports of the recruitment processes and die GESIS Panel reference paper (Bosnjak et al., 2017).

To discover the cultural impediments to these technologies, the author conducted 181 formal, semi-structured interviews at more than 82 institutions (including electric utilities, regulatory agencies, interest groups, energy systems manufacturers, nonprofit organizations, consulting firms, universities, national laboratories, and state institutions) from 2005 to 2008. These interviews were supplemented with an extensive literature review. The study finds that the apparent disconnect between how electricity is made and how it is socially perceived perpetuates public apathy and misinformation about it; also that deeply held values related to consumption, abundance, trust, control, and freedom shape American attitudes toward energy. As a result, wind farms and solar panels (along with other renewable power systems) are often opposed not because they are a poor alternative to fossil fuels, but because people simply do not comprehend why such technologies may be needed.

However, what part the value of the biological component in these scenes plays in fostering people's enjoyment is unclear. Using the contingent valuation method (CVM), we examined divers' willingness to pay for changes in the fish and coral attributes over an artificial reef. Using image manipulations, different levels of community descriptors, such as richness, abundance, and biodiversity of corals and fish, were isolated, and the willingness to pay for proposed factors was examined. The results showed that divers were willing to contribute towards all increases in reef community attributes, and were partially able to discriminate between them.

Reefs were divided into three regions (east, central, west) across an east to west gradient of increasing reef complexity and salinity. Gray triggerfish (Balistes capriscus) primarily consumed reef-associated prey (xanthid crabs, bivalves, barnacles) and pelagic gastropods, while red snapper (Lutjanus campechanus) diets were mainly comprised of non-reef prey (stomatopods, fishes, portunid crabs). Natural stable isotopes of carbon (delta13C), nitrogen (delta15N), and sulfur (delta34S) were measured in consumer muscle tissue as well as potential primary producers. Gray triggerfish occupied a lower trophic position than red snapper, with lower delta13C and delta15N values across all size classes and regions, and generally higher delta34S values. Red snapper had a smaller range of stable isotope values and corrected standard ellipse areas across all size classes and regions, indicating a smaller isotopic niche. Contribution estimates of particulate organic matter (26 to 54%) and benthic microalgae (BMA, 47 to 74%) for both species were similar, with BMA contributions greater across all three size classes (juveniles, sub-adults, adults) of red snapper and all but the juvenile size class for gray triggerfish. Species gut contents and stable isotopes differed by region, with fishes consuming more crabs in the east region and more gastropods in the central and west regions. delta13C and delta15N values generally decreased from east to west, while delta34S increased across this gradient. Results highlight species-specific feeding differences associated with artificial reefs, where gray triggerfish may be more dependent on the reef structure for foraging opportunities. In addition, results offer further information on the integral role of BMA in primary production at nearshore artificial reefs.

Fishing activity in two artificial reefs (ARs) was monitored between August 2001 and August 2002 in the gulf of Morrosquillo, to investigate their possible impact on the fishery dynamics. We determined catch per unit effort (CPUE) and catch composition, and found 19 species in Punta de Piedra and 36 in Tolu (16 species common to both). In Punta de Piedra, CPUE was 0.40 kg/hour/fisherman and estimated annual catch was 1 830 kg (Tolu values: 0.42 kg/hour/fisherman and 4 820 kg). No significant differences in CPUE were found between ARs and no seasonal pattern was evident. The differences in total composition and extracted biomass between ARs were mainly a consequence of greater effort exerted in Tolu, whereas the absence of trends and correlation with environmental factors of CPUE and species caught suggests that the ARs are near their carrying capacity. As expected, the ARs supported and improved CPUE and fishing success in comparison with reported values of natural habitats, traditional fishing grounds and some artificial habitats in the zone, owing to their greater volume, structural complexity and vertical profile. However, this increase could also be the result of biomass aggregation, not production. The potential negative impacts of ARs on the environment require experimental research. The deployment of non-extractive ARs and the controlled usage for fishery purposes could be a useful tool for resource enhancement and management in the area. Rev. Biol. Trop. 57 (4): 993-1007.

Sea-ice losses around West Antarctica's continental shelf generate longer phytoplankton blooms but also make it a hotspot for coastal iceberg disturbance. This matters because in polar regions ice scour limits blue carbon storage ecosystem services, which work as a powerful negative feedback on climate change (less sea ice increases phytoplankton blooms, benthic growth, seabed carbon and sequestration). This resets benthic biota succession (maintaining regional biodiversity) and also fertilizes the ocean with nutrients, generating phytoplankton blooms, which cascade carbon capture into seabed storage and burial by benthos. Small icebergs scour coastal shallows, whereas giant icebergs ground deeper, offshore. Significant benthic communities establish where ice shelves have disintegrated (giant icebergs calving), and rapidly grow to accumulate blue carbon storage. When 5000 km(2) giant icebergs calve, we estimate that they generate approximately 10(6) tonnes of immobilized zoobenthic carbon per year (tCyr(-1)). However, their collisions with the seabed crush and recycle vast benthic communities, costing an estimated 4 x 10(4) tCyr(-1). We calculate that giant iceberg formation (ice shelf disintegration) has a net potential of approximately 10(6) tCyr(-1) sequestration benefits as well as more widely known negative impacts.This article is part of the theme issue 'The marine system of the West Antarctic Peninsula: status and strategy for progress in a region of rapid change'.",,,,,,,,,58,0,0,0,42,1,60,,,1364-503X,1471-2962,,,,,,,,,,"British Antarctic Survey, Nat Environm Res Council, Madingley Rd, Cambridge CB3 0ET, EnglandInst Antartico Argentino, Dept Biol Costera, 25 Mayo 1147 PC 1650, Buenos Aires, DF, ArgentinaMuseo Argentino Ciencias Nat Bernardino Rivadavia, Ave A Gallardo 470 C1405DJR, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina",,,,2018-05-28,WOS:000432326900011,29760118,

Platforms provide substrate for sessile organisms such as barnacles and oysters that enhance habitat for stone crabs Menippe spp. and other fouling-associated organisms. In recent years, Louisiana's small nearshore platforms (<15 m) have been subjected to a high rate of removal, but little is known about their relative value as artificial reefs. During 2014, we compared stone crab populations at platforms on and off Ship Shoal in order to evaluate habitat conditions in the two areas. We hypothesized that platforms on the shoal would provide higher quality habitat than those in the surrounding area because the shoal supports higher diversity and abundances of benthic organisms. Stone crab populations were characterized by means of visual counts and by removing subsamples for species identification, sexing, and carapace measurements. Of the 378 stone crabs collected, 368 were Gulf stone crabs M. adina and 10 were Cuban stone crabs M. nodifrons. Stone crabs colonized every platform studied, but densities were higher (mean values: 4.0 crabs/m(2) on the shoal versus 1.8 crabs/m(2) off the shoal), and carapace width at 50% maturity (CW50) was 27.1 mm larger for crabs on than off the shoal. Mean carapace width, size-class distribution, and sex ratio of crabs on and off the shoal were not significantly different. Platforms provided substrate for barnacles, which enhanced the structural complexity of platforms and were observed to be prey for stone crabs. Nevertheless, higher stone crab density and CW50 on the shoal suggested that shoal platforms are better habitat types for stone crabs.",,,,,,,,,7,0,0,0,6,0,7,,,0002-8487,1548-8659,,,,,,,,,,"Louisiana State Univ, Dept Oceanog & Coastal Sci, 1002-Y Energy Coast & Environm Bldg, Baton Rouge, LA 70803 USALouisiana Univ Marine Consortium, 8124 Highway 56, Chauvin, LA 70344 USALouisiana State Univ, Dept Expt Stat, 161 MD Woodin Hall, Baton Rouge, LA 70803 USA",Louisiana Univ Marine Consortium,,,2017-05-10,WOS:000399571200001,,

This study used baited remote underwater stereo-video systems (stereo-BRUVs) to compare species richness, fish abundance and size along 42.3 km of subsea pipeline and in adjacent areas of varying habitats. The pipeline is laid in an onshore-offshore direction enabling surveys to encompass a range of depths from 9 m nearshore out to 140 m depth offshore. Surveys off the pipeline were performed across this depth range and in an array of natural habitats (sand, macroalgae, coral reef) between 1 km and 40 km distance from the pipeline. A total of 14,953 fish were observed comprising 240 species (131 on the pipeline and 225 off-pipeline) and 59 families (39 on the pipeline and 56 off-pipeline) and the length of 8,610 fish were measured. The fish assemblage on and off the pipeline was similar in depths of <80 m. In depths beyond 80 m, the predominant habitat off-pipeline was sand and differences between fish assemblages on and off-pipeline were more pronounced. The pipeline was characterised by higher biomass and abundances of larger-bodied, commercially important species such as: Pristipomoides multidens (goldband snapper), Lutjanus malabaricus (saddletail snapper) and Lutjanus russellii (Moses' snapper) among others, and possessed a catch value 2-3 times higher per stereo-BRUV deployment than that of fish observed off-pipeline. Adjacent natural seabed habitats possessed higher abundances of Atule mate (yellowtail scad), Nemipterus spp. (threadfin bream) and Terapon jarbua (crescent grunter), species of no or low commercial value. This is the first published study to use stereo-BRUVs to report on the importance of subsea infrastructure to commercially important fishes over a depth gradient and increases our knowledge of the fish assemblage associated with subsea infrastructure off north-west Australia.

With the recent development of fine-scale acoustic tracking, ecologists and fishery managers have gained a powerful tool to explore how exploited species behave in newly created artificial habitats. Here, we report for the first time the space used by the black scorpionfish (Scorpaena porcus) and red scorpionfish (Scorpaena scrofa), two highly important exploited species in the Mediterranean Sea that are often managed with ARs. The Vemco VR2W positioning system (VPS) was used to examine the fine-scale movement patterns (home range) and residency time of these species. S. porcus (182-271 mm total length; n = 14) and S. scrofa (252-445 mm total length; n = 7) were tracked for up to 91 d in ARs located in Edremit Bay, northern Aegean Sea, Turkey. The results revealed high site fidelity during the tracking period and high variability (among individuals) in their home range areas, which ranged from 933 m(2) to 28,674 m(2) (Kernel Utilization Distribution 95%) for S. porcus and from 1895 m(2) to 17,487 m(2) for S. scrofa, with a mean and s.d. of 9591 +/- 8998 m(2) and 8104 +/- 6113 m(2), respectively. The variability in the home range areas was explained neither by the fish length nor diel phase (day vs. night), although residency indexes suggested stronger site fidelity in large S. scrofa. While the lack of size-dependent home range behavior could be explained by the limited size of the range (imposed by the telemetry system), the lack of diel differences in their home range sizes could be explained by the ambush predatory behavior of both species. Our findings suggested that ARs may facilitate the profitability of fisheries in both species by retaining adults and enhancing recruitment of newly settled fish, as suggested by the movement patterns and habitat utilization indexes considered in this study.",,,,,,,,,14,0,0,0,11,0,16,,,0165-7836,1872-6763,,,,,,,,,,"Ege Univ, Fac Fisheries, TR-35100 Izmir, TurkeyIzmir Katip Celebi Univ, Fac Fisheries, TR-35620 Izmir, TurkeyUIB, CSIC, Inst Mediterraneo Estudios Avanzados, IMEDEA, C Miquel Marques 21, Esporles 07190, Illes Balears, Spain",,,,2018-12-28,WOS:000451934800003,,

Benthic and necto-benthic species presented a striking increase in abundance and richness in the second year of colonization, while more mobile species did not evince any variation between years. Differences in mobility among species suggest that the latter group may have reached the breakwater from nearby artificial substrates, whereas the former colonized the new structure as recruits.

The nonlinearities concern both the calculation of the wave loading and the structural analysis of the platform. More specifically, numerical calculations have been undertaken using a fully nonlinear three-dimensional wave model capable of accurately representing a realistic distribution of wave energy in both frequency and direction. The purpose of these calculations is to provide what is essentially a benchmark against which to assess the accuracy of the commonly applied design wave solutions; linear and 2nd order random waves and linear and nonlinear steady wave solutions. On the other hand, in the field of structural analysis, three cases are considered for comparison, linear analysis, nonlinear analysis with the nonlinearity limited to the modelling of the soil and finally, geometrically nonlinear analysis with nonlinear modelling of the soil. The calculations are performed using the well-known structural analysis software SAP2000, enhanced with an interface that was developed in order to calculate the forces due to wave loading and apply them on the structural members. The example treated in the context of the present paper is a compliant tower, set-up in deep water. The results show that for the specific environmental conditions and for the structure examined herein, the consideration of the nonlinear particle kinematics in the wave loading and the consideration of the structural nonlinearities leads to significant differences with respect to the common design methods in both the displacements and stresses of the structure. Moreover, irrespectively of the adopted wave theory, the structural nonlinear analyses lead to significant discrepancies from the linear ones. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

In this study, based on Illumina sequencing analysis of 18S rDNA, the diversity and community structure of protists in coral reef, artificial reef and open-water areas in Daya Bay were described for the first time. The biodiversity of protists in open-water areas was higher than that in artificial reefs and slightly higher than that in coral reefs, but there were no significant differences in protist alpha diversity among the different habitats or depths in Daya Bay. The depth of Daya Bay was not sufficient to significantly affect the distribution of the protist communities, while pH and salinity had the strongest impacts. Furthermore, the correlations between protist abundance and environmental variables of the water mass were much weaker than those between habitat and protist abundance. PERMANOVA revealed significant differences in protist diversity among the habitats. The interactions of living organisms and differences among habitats play key roles in the formation of protist communities, and artificial reefs were found to change the community structure of protists, suggesting that artificial reefs play a role similar to that of coral reefs to improve ecological functions and restore ecosystems.",,,,,,,,,11,0,0,0,9,0,13,,,0272-7714,1096-0015,,,,,,,,,,"Chinese Acad Fishery Sci, South China Sea Fisheries Res Inst, Guangzhou 510300, Guangdong, Peoples R ChinaMinist Agr, Sci Observing & Expt Stn South China Sea Fishery, Guangzhou 510300, Guangdong, Peoples R ChinaChinese Acad Fishery Sci, Key Lab Marine Ranching, Guangzhou 510300, Guangdong, Peoples R ChinaShanghai Ocean Univ, Shanghai, Peoples R China",,,,2019-10-22,WOS:000489190500038,,

Generally, policies mandate removal of these structures post-production; however, many enter 'Rigs-to-Reefs' (RTR) programs that convert the rig materials into artificial reefs ('reefing'). Despite the growth of RTR programs worldwide, the functionality of the resulting habitats remains uncertain, particularly due to the lack of comparative studies with natural systems. To address this data gap as it relates to trophic ecology, we compared annual, ontogenetic, and habitat-specific diet and stable isotope signatures (delta C-13 and delta N-1(5)) of adult red snapper Lutjanus campechanus (n = 1585) from relic coralgal natural reefs to those of fish from standing and reefed platforms located in similar depth strata of the northwestern GOM. Stomach content analyses revealed significant effects of year, habitat, and total length on prey composition. Subsequent analyses of stable isotope values by size class identified a non-linear relationship with ontogeny. delta C-13 and delta N-15 values at reefed platforms and natural reefs decreased in the medium size class (401-600 mm total length), whereas fish from standing platforms exhibited more consistent feeding patterns across ontogeny. Annual variability was also observed in delta C-13 and delta N-15 values, with 2013 and 2014 significantly different from 2015. These findings suggest that the trophic impacts of habitat type on reef fishes are more complex than previously considered in the GOM and that reefed platforms provide foraging opportunities more similar to natural reefs than standing platforms.",,,,,,,,,7,0,0,0,7,0,7,,,0171-8630,1616-1599,,,,,,,,,,"Florida Atlantic Univ, Harbor Branch, Oceanog Inst, 5600 US Highway 1 North, Ft Pierce, FL 34946 USATexas A&M Univ, Harte Res Inst Gulf Mexico Studies, 6300 Ocean Dr, Corpus Christi, TX 78412 USA",,,,2020-04-07,WOS:000521737900009,,

Social opposition to wind farms grows daily, and people allied with social movements, associations, human rights organizations, and universities have made many local interventions to stop construction. This research aims to demonstrate that even though investments in Brazilian wind power, especially Ceará state, were based on a conservationist and regionalist discourse, wind power benefits actually flow to outside groups without financial returns accruing locally, and, even worse, causing material and non-material damages to people who live near wind farms. This study reveals that laws regulating wind-power development in Brazil facilitate the implementation of wind farms to the detriment of broad social acceptance because it is a means to make local residents invisible, as in the case of exclusion of communities on maps used to obtain environmental licenses or land-title fraud (grilagem) of collective and historical land claims. Finally, we suggest measures for better control of policies for wind-farm development in Ceará that would make it possible for communities to negotiate as equals with wind-power investors and obtain benefits from the profitability of wind-power generation.","Resumen Aunque la energia eólica sea considerada como una fuente energética limpia, las investigaciones muestran que la implantación de campos eólicos en el nordeste brasileño está generando diversos impactos sociales e ambientales negtivos a las poblaciones que se encuentran en el litoral, especialmente a los pescadores tradicionales, a los campesinos, a los quilombolas y a los pueblos indígenas.

Any just regulatory process for considering and permitting such infrastructure will need to heed the concerns that local communities voice. But what counts as a local voice? In this paper it is argued that the regulatory process plays a performative role, constructing what counts as a local voice. Furthermore, this has consequences for how regulatory deliberations proceed and the outcomes of regulatory processes. The empirical basis for this argument is a study of major offshore renewable energy infrastructure in England and Wales and the way that it is regulated through a specific regime - the Nationally Significant Infrastructure Projects (NSIPs) regime established by the Planning Act 2008. Through a detailed study of eight projects that have passed through the regime, the analysis unfolds the way that the voices of local residents, local businesses, local NGOs and local authorities are constructed in the key boundary object of the Examining Authority's report; it then draws out the implications for the mitigation measures that are negotiated. The research suggests that what counts as a local voice is constrained by how the performative role of the NSIPs regulatory regime differentiates between interests and suggests that new ways of giving voice to local people are required.",,,,,,,,,19,0,0,0,1,0,19,,,1354-9839,1469-6711,,,,,,,,,,"UCL, Bartlett Sch Planning, London, EnglandUCL, Sch Laws, London, EnglandUCL, Dept Sci & Technol Studies, London, England",,,,2018-05-25,WOS:000432281100005,,

The reef complex (1500 m(2)) consisted of two sets (concrete and tire), each comprising 16 modules. Trammel nets were used in monthly samplings of the reef site and a control area. During 2 years of monitoring, 51 fish species were recorded in both areas, of which 24% and 11%, respectively, were found exclusively at the reef and in the control area. The most abundant families were Carcharhinidae, Carangidae, and Triakidae. Based on c.p.u.e. in numbers and weights, density and biomass appear to be higher at the reef site than in the control area. At the reef, species richness and diversity were generally higher during the second year, which may reflect the degree of fouling. Visual observations revealed higher fish diversity on concrete experimental structures than on tire modules. The effectiveness of the reef in creating a complex habitat for the fish community is shown by the dominance of the shark (Rhizoprionodon lalandei), a predator of small teleosts commonly found on the reef structures.

From side-scan sonar imagery, we created a categorical habitat map of the hard- and sand-bottom habitats surrounding the reef. We recorded water conditions using an Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler. Correlations between gag space use (distance from the reef, distance from the seafloor, and travel speed) and environmental conditions (bottom type, time of day, lunar phase, and water temperature, speed and flow direction) showed gag typically using space near, but not directly at the reef. The 50% and 95% kernel density contours fell within 17 and 39 m of the reef, respectively, though gag spent the most time about 10 m from the reef. All individuals made occasional excursions beyond their primary space-use areas. Gag spent 86% of the time within 2.5 m of the seafloor, with periods of frequent or extended movement up to 9 m from the seafloor, usually near the reef. On average, gag moved about 25% farther from the reef during the day; correlations with other environmental conditions were weak or unclear. In all cases, variation in space-use among individuals or of particular individuals over time was greater than the variability explained by changing environmental conditions. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Innovative technologies may offer a means to target deepwater populations and allow for the development of a lionfish trap fishery, but the removal efficiency and potential environmental impacts of lionfish traps have not been evaluated. We tested a collapsible, non-containment trap (the 'Gittings trap') near artificial reefs in the northern Gulf of Mexico. A total of 327 lionfish and 28 native fish (four were species protected with regulations) recruited (i.e., were observed within the trap footprint at the time of retrieval) to traps during 82 trap sets, catching 144 lionfish and 29 native fish (one more than recruited, indicating detection error). Lionfish recruitment was highest for single (versus paired) traps deployed <15 m from reefs with a 1-day soak time, for which mean lionfish and native fish recruitment per trap were approximately 5 and 0.1, respectively. Lionfish from traps were an average of 19 mm or 62 grams larger than those caught spearfishing. Community impacts from Gittings traps appeared minimal given that recruitment rates were >10X higher for lionfish than native fishes and that traps did not move on the bottom during two major storm events, although further testing will be necessary to test trap movement with surface floats. Additional research should also focus on design and operational modifications to improve Gittings trap deployment success (68% successfully opened on the seabed) and reduce lionfish escapement (56% escaped from traps upon retrieval).

However, if they soon appeared as a convenient response to fisheries depletion, there has since been a shift between this ideal perception and a real understanding of their functioning and impact.The assessment of their actual performance is constrained by a knowledge deficit about ecosystems' natural variability, the definition of appropriate spatial and temporal scale studies, and the difficulty and cost of field surveys. In such a context, a number of questions can be raised, such as: (1) Is there an increase or redistribution of biological resources? (2) Are habitats a limiting factor for resources under heavy exploitation or limited recruitment? (3) Is ecosystem engineering enough and adapted as a response to resources degradation?, (4) What kind of control may be applied in regard to the system's possible modification?In France, artificial reefs are mainly used for the purpose and benefit of coastal fisheries.

Better understanding human-wildlife interactions and their links with management can help improve the design of wildlife protection zones. One important example is the problem of wildlife collisions with vehicles or human-built structures (e.g. power lines, wind farms). In fact, collisions between marine wildlife and watercraft are among the major threats faced by several endangered species of marine mammals. Natural resource managers are therefore interested in finding cost-effective solutions to mitigate these threats. 2. We combined abundance estimators with encounter rate theory to estimate relative lethal collision risk of the Florida manatee (Trichechus manatus latirostris) from watercraft. We first modeled seasonal abundance of watercraft and manatees using a Bayesian analysis of aerial survey count data. We then modeled relative lethal collision risk in space and across seasons. Finally, we applied decision analysis and Linear Integer Programming to determine the optimal design of speed zones in terms of relative risk to manatees and costs to waterway users. We used a Pareto efficient frontier approach to evaluate the performance of alternative zones, which included additional practical considerations (e.g. spatial aggregation of speed zones) in relation to the optimal zone configurations. 3. Under the various relationships for probability of death given strike speed that we considered, the current speed zones reduced the relative lethal collision risk by an average of 51.5% to 70% compared to the scenario in which all speed regulations were removed (i.e. the no-protection scenario). We identified optimal zones and near-optimal zones with additional management considerations that improved upon the current zones in terms of cost or relative risk. 4. Policy Implications: Our analytical framework combines encounter rate theory and decision analysis to quantify the effectiveness of speed zones protecting manatees while accounting for uncertainty. Our approach can be used to optimize the design of protection zones intended to reduce conflicts between human waterborne activity and marine mammals. This framework could be extended to address many other problems of human-wildlife interactions, such as the optimal placement of wind farms to minimize collisions with wildlife or the optimal allocation of ranger effort to mitigate poaching threats.

These analyses include modeling the abundance of manatees and boats in space and time using a Bayesian approach; modeling the lethal collision risk to manatees on a fine scale under different boat speed zones; and determining the optimal protection zones using Linear Integer Programming to balance the trade off between risk to manatees and burdens to waterway users. These analyses are organized into 4 different folders: 1) a folder with data and code to run a Bayesian analysis of abundance (using informative priors) using multi-season and single season N-mixture models of the hurdle variety (used to model abundance of manatees). 2) a folder with data and code to run a Bayesian analysis of abundance (using informative priors) using a multi-season hurdle model (used to model abundance of boats), 3) a folder with data and code to model the lethal collision risk between boats and manatees on a fine spatial scale while accounting for uncertainty.

Fishes were collected through bottom gillnets at 1 month, 6 months, 1 year, 6 years, 7 years, and 10 years after artificial reef deployment. A total of 961 fishes belonging to 41 species and 18 families were caught, with C. chrysurus (Carangidae) and C. nobilis (Haemulidae) as the dominant species and Sciaenidae as the richest family (N = 11 species). No single species occurred throughout the surveys and fish species composition differed temporally among <1 year, 1-6 year, and 7-10 year time intervals. Fish richness, abundance, biomass, and size varied significantly with time; richness increased gradually toward a stabilization in the last years. Abundance and biomass decreased after the sixth year, and size decreased linearly through time. No temporal trend of fish abundance and biomass was found for piscivorous species; however, these variables increased until the sixth and seventh years for planktivorous and invertivorous fishes. Abundance and biomass of the most frequent fish families changed differentially with time, with a gradual decreasing after the first year for Carcharhinidae and Triakidae, a unimodal response for Carangidae and Haemulidae, and a steady increment for Sciaenidae and Ariidae.

Designed artificial reef systems are similar, albeit smaller, modified habitats designed to accommodate fish assemblages. We compared fish production at a large designed reef to reported production at oil platforms. Given the focus in artificial reef research on distinguishing between new and aggregated fish production, we used a different approach to that of Claisse et al. (Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 111: 15462-15467, 2014) to calculate production, based on a steady-state assumption. This assumption simplifies the analysis and distinguishes 'local production', 'new production', and 'biomass flux'. Comparing biomass flux with standing stock biomass enables a new approach to address the production versus attraction debate, by revealing how much biomass is exposed to fishing compared to how much has local production. The local fish production at this artificial reef was 384 g m(-2) year(-1), which is within the 105887 g m(-2) year(-1) range reported by Claisse et al., although our study included visitor species not included by Claisse et al. We estimate that the fish production new to the ecosystem may only be 4-5 % of the local production, due to the large abundance of visitor species on this reef. The annual flux of biomass across this reef was very large, similar to 380 times greater than the standing stock biomass, meaning that this reef is vulnerable to overexploitation from fishing. Our results show that like oil platforms, designed artificial reefs can be very productive marine habitats, but may not greatly increase the net fish production in a system. The method detailed here will allow similar studies to be done relatively simply at other marine habitats, including fish aggregation devices.",,,,,,,,,57,1,0,0,52,0,62,,,0025-3162,1432-1793,,,,,,,,,,"Univ New South Wales, Evolut & Ecol Res Ctr, Sydney, NSW 2052, AustraliaUniv New South Wales, Sch Biol Earth & Environm Sci, Sydney, NSW 2052, AustraliaSydney Inst Marine Sci, Chowder Bay Rd, Mosman, NSW 2088, AustraliaNSW Dept Primary Ind, Port Stephens Fisheries Inst, Taylors Beach Rd, Taylors Beach, NSW 2316, Australia",,,,2016-09-01,WOS:000382753200008,,

Commonly treated at law, and in fact, as an extension of terrestrial or marine spaces, recognition of air as habitat and related conservation protection is rare. In addition, management is confounded by the dynamic, three-dimensional and indivisible nature of airspace, by wildlife and aircraft mobility, and by temporal features. Regulation of airspace and patterns of spatial activity are dominated by aircraft traffic control and related transport imperatives to the exclusion of wildlife protection. Where strategic planning mechanisms are applied, they are often tied to amorphous definitions of habitat, rely upon terrestrial habitat protection for their expression or are reflected as two-dimensional notations on a map.

Although they have received little attention to date, the large-scale development of upland wind farms also has the potential to disturb vegetation and soils, alter hydrology and water quality and, thus, impact freshwater ecosystems. This paper presents the findings of a 5-year study of the impacts of wind farm construction on the freshwater environment. Data on water quality, invertebrate and fish populations were collected for 2 years before construction and for the following 3 years covering the construction period and the initial period of the farm's operation. In contrast to previous studies, the impacts of the wind farm development were assessed for a suite of potentially affected hydrochemical variables using a before-after-control-impact (BACI) analysis that allowed separation of construction effects from spatial and temporal variability in hydroclimatological conditions, thereby providing an improved, more robust evidence base. Therewas a small but significant negative effect of construction on pH, alkalinity (Alk) and acid neutralising capacity (ANC) in the upper part of the treatment catchment, which was where the wind farm was situated. The effects were more marked under higher flow conditions. It is hypothesised that this reflects changes in hydrological processes with increased near-surface runoff or organic acid mobilisation.

We used a VEMCO Positioning System (VPS) to monitor the fine-scale movements of yellowfin bream (Acanthopagrus australis, referred to as Bream), an estuarine predator and important recreational species. Fish were implanted with acoustic tags with accelerometer sensors (to measure relative fish activity), and their movements monitored on an artificial reef and adjacent habitats. Elevated activity patterns during crepuscular periods indicated that foraging was likely occurring over a large seagrass bed adjacent to the artificial reef system. Alternatively, lower activity was observed when fish were on the artificial reef, which may reflect the role of this habitat as a refuge, or that alternative foraging strategies were being employed. All fish exhibited a high degree of fidelity to the artificial reef on which they were tagged, and there was minimal movement among other reef groups within the array. There was extensive overlap in space use contours for smaller fish on the seagrass edge, but no overlap for larger fish that also tended to forage further afield.

Four reefs were deployed on sandy-muddy bottom far from natural reefs, while the fifth was placed in a bay surrounded by rocky shores. The reefs were formed of cubic concrete blocks (2 X 2 X 2 m) arranged in pyramids. Concrete cages (4 X 6 X 5 m) for shellfish culture were placed among the pyramids. Underwater observations and sampling showed rapid colonization of the concrete block reefs at all locations. The sessile community was dominated by filter-feeders, mainly represented by mussels (Mytilus galloprovincialis) and oysters (Ostrea edulis and Crassostrea gigas). At all sites, fishing surveys conducted with a standard trammel net were started 1 year before reef deployment and have been continued. The aim was to compare the effectiveness of the reefs in the different areas in terms of fishing yield and their impact on the fish assemblage of the original habitat. The effects of the artificial reefs were particularly evident at sites far from natural hard substrates. Catches at these sites after reef deployment showed a gradual increase in fish abundance, in species richness (both mean and total) and diversity. Evidence for this was the appearance and/or the increase in catches of some hard-substrate species of fish (e.g., Sciaena umbra, Umbrina cirrosa and Scorpaena porcus) and molluscs (Eledone moschata and Rapana venosa) which were rare or completely absent in the original sand-plain habitat. The increase of these species seemed to be directly correlated to the reef dimensions in terms of volume of immersed materials and of area covered. Different results were obtained at the site near natural hard substrates, where many reef-dwelling species were also caught before the reef construction, and total richness was already very high (49 species caught) in comparison to the other four sites (22-31 species).",,,,,,,,,96,2,0,0,58,4,106,,,0007-4977,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1994-09-01,WOS:A1994QB58400025,,

Nearshore ecosystems are increasingly recognized as critical habitats for fish of cultural, ecological and economic significance. These ecosystems are often densely inhabited by juvenile fish, highly productive and refuges from predation, leading ecologists to characterize them as nurseries. However, nearshore ecosystems are being transformed globally to support demands of growing coastal populations. Many shorelines are modified by armouring (e.g. seawalls, riprap) that minimizes erosion, and overwater structures (e.g. piers, docks) that facilitate waterfront use. These modifications affect the ecology of nearshore systems by restructuring, eliminating and shading shallow waters.2. Here, we review literature examining effects of armouring and overwater structures on coastal and estuarine fishes, and discuss how research and management can coordinate to minimize negative effects.3. Along armoured shorelines, fish assemblages differed from unarmoured sites, fish consumed less epibenthic and terrestrial prey, beach spawning was less successful and fish were larger. Under large overwater structures, visually oriented fish were less abundant and they fed less. Shade from overwater structures also interrupted localized movements of migratory fish. Thus, shoreline modifications impaired habitats by limiting feeding, reproduction, ontogenetic habitat shifts from shallow to deeper waters and connectivity.4. Research suggests that restoring shallow waters and substrate complexity, and minimizing shading underneath overwater structures, can rehabilitate habitats compromised by shoreline modifications.5. Synthesis and applications. Shoreline armouring and overwater structures often compromise fish habitats. These threats to nearshore fish habitats will become more severe as growing coastal populations and rising sea levels increase demands for shoreline infrastructure. Our ability to assess and rehabilitate nearshore fish habitats along modified shorelines will be enhanced by: focusing research attention on metrics that directly indicate fish habitat quality; implementing and evaluating shoreline features that repair compromised habitat functions within human-use constraints; collating natural history knowledge of nearshore ecosystems; and embracing the socio-ecological nature of habitat improvements by educating the public about conservation efforts and fostering appreciation of local nearshore ecosystems. Actions to reduce impacts of shoreline modifications on fish are particularly feasible when they align with societal goals, such as improving flood protection and providing spaces that facilitate recreation, education, and connections between people and nature.",,,,,,,,,53,0,0,0,45,0,60,,,0021-8901,1365-2664,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Washington, Sch Aquat & Fishery Sci, 1122 NE Boat St, Seattle, WA 98105 USA",,,,2017-10-01,WOS:000410678700010,,

Although all of these types of event could be directly beneath earthquakes, damage caused by(1) or(2) seems to be larger than that caused by the others. There does not seem to be a consensus yet on rating the probabilities of the future occurrence of these events. It is important to conduct future studies on what types of earthquake pose a future threat beneath the Tokyo Metropolitan Area.An earthquake as a geophysical phenomena is not a disaster. When an earthquake causes various human casualties, it is called a disaster. If a huge scale of damage is caused by an intermediate scale of earthquake, even if the earthquake is not so severe the result might be a large-scale disaster. When the next earthquake of M 7 class hits central Tokyo, it is imaginable that it will cause a large-scale disaster. It is called the next Tokyo Earthquake which is an earthquake occurring directly beneath the Tokyo Metropolitan Area, in this volume. We have to prepare various measures against the next Tokyo Earthquake, which require us to understand the general nature of the disaster caused, and to estimate the extent of damage.

Transport of power from wind farms in this section of the country to the coastal regions where population and the need for power are high is limited by the capacity of the electrical grid, which was designed to link power sources (mainly coal and nuclear plants) located close to demand centers. Television and radio broadcasters are heavy consumers of electrical power with transmission facilities distributed across all regions of the US. Most regions are served by broadcasters with transmitters on or adjacent to farmland. In many cases, the placement of 1 turbine on each of these farms would generate enough power for both the farmer and the broadcaster without adding to the load on the utility grid. TV and FM broadcasters spend more than $400MM annually on transmitter power. A distributed wind cooperative among broadcasters and farmers will bring many benefits to rural economies and to the environment. It will improve the sustainability of local television in rural communities by making a direct substantial reduction to their electrical bill, which is their largest non-personnel expense Benefits to the agriculture industry include a new, reliable, on-site cash generating wind energy crop that can be sold locally. The project will enable substantial amounts of money spent for energy to remain in local, rural communities. It will also help to provide a steady income for farmers which could prevent the sale or repossession of the family farm due to financial hardship. These distributed, local community-based, renewable power systems have been prevalent in Europe for decades. Distributed wind energy systems circumvent the national power grid constraints by utilizing the power directly, on site. There are approximately 1,200 TV and 2,600 FM transmitters in the 12 windswept Midwest states and another 14,000 transmitters in the remaining states. If fully realized, distributed wind turbines serving all TV and FM markets have the potential to produce approximately 4 TW hours of renewable energy and eliminate 2.5 million metric tons of CO2 annually. It has been well established that wind turbines can cause interference to TV and Radio transmissions. Phases 1 of this project developed a proof of feasibility basic interference model. Phase II will develop an general interference prediction model that can be used to properly place turbines on farms in close proximity to transmission towers while eliminating or mitigating problems with signal interference. Phase 3 will demonstrate the full technical and economic performance of an operating transmitter powered by and co-sited with a fully operational wind turbine.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,2012-33610-20114; 578080,,,,,,,,ROBERT MILLER CONSULTING LLC,ROBERT MILLER CONSULTING LLC,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:12675068,,

Two plastic, triangle-shaped, porous artificial reefs were moored on the seafloor: a) below a cod farm and b) at a nearby reference site, and were monitored for 4 months, on a bi-weekly basis by SCUBA divers. Monitoring included both visual observations, mainly of the motile biota, and subsampling of the fouling community by removing pieces of plastic mesh that were attached to the reefs for this purpose. Diverse biological communities developed on the artificial reefs at both fish farm and reference sites; however, overall species richness, abundance and sessile species cover were consistently greater at the farm site. Although the biota recorded were typical boreal species, many of the same taxa observed in warmer waters, in similar studies, were found on these reefs. Artificial reefs are one of many options that may be considered to enhance the sustainability of coastal aquaculture, and we suggest that: a) ARs should be studied over the course of a year or more, and b) efforts should be made to consider how we may harvest the biota associated with the ARs for commercial use.",,,,,,,,,9,2,0,0,7,0,11,,,1867-1616,1867-1624,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Haifa, Dept Maritime Civilizat, Leon Recanati Inst Maritime Studies, Charney Sch Marine Sci, Haifa, IsraelWestfjords Nat Hist Inst, Natturustofa Vestfjarda, Westfjords, Iceland",Westfjords Nat Hist Inst,,,2017-06-23,WOS:000403061500018,,

However, evidence indicates that artificial reefs have formed around some of these structures and their removal could cause more harm than good. Furthermore, other perceived social, environmental and economic benefits of a total removal policy may not be warranted. The Australian regulator (NOPSEMA) is currently exploring the possibility of supporting an in situ decommissioning policy, in which alternatives to full removal such as leaving in situ, partial removal or nearby relocation may be adopted if demonstrated to be the preferable approach. This will necessarily involve changes to law and policy but such amendments must be evidence-based. The evidence needed will largely involve the disciplines of engineering and natural sciences, but also fields such as environmental management, economics, social sciences and law. If Australia were to progress an in situ decommissioning policy shift, research will be needed across all of these areas in the specific national context. This paper commences by outlining emergent engineering knowledge, showing the general conservatism of current methodologies available to assess the integrity of decommissioned offshore facilities.

Two groups of three structures (Reef Ball (TM)) were disposed in the Island Joao da Cunha/SC, a group located near the rocky shore and the other with a distance of 50 meters. The strategy of visual census was used in the accompaniment of ictiofauna, done by linear transects in the mentioned areas. The fishes were counted and identified to the lesser possible taxon. A total of 19 species were identified, Stegastes fuscus was the most abundant in the area close to the rocky shore and Haemulon sp for the distant points. The diversity was larger in the reefs near to the rockyshore (0,693 1,925 nats) then in the distant points (0,60 1,332 nats). The total abundance also presented a similar standard pattern to the diversity, being higher near the rockyshore. Two distinct species associations were identified, one in distant reef points composed by Batigobius soporator, Haemulon sp and Anisotremus virginicus; and another association near the rockyshore, composed by Sparissoma sp, Epinephelus marginatus, Sphoeroides testudineus, Eucinostomus sp, Stegastes fuscus Diplopodus argenteus, Pareques acuminatus and Epinephelus morio. The presence and the distance of the rocky shore, was shown as an important factor, in the colonization of artificial reefs.

Abiotic and biotic site characteristics were investigated by water analysis for each sampling cycle. Further, data of contaminant loads of the softbody and pollutant concentration of the water column, suspended particles and sediments from both sites were analysed. Results show that positive offshore effects due to dilution of contamination were not evident for all parameters analysed. Condition indices were high, and parasites were not present in offshore mussels. In contrast, the integrative health parameter LMS and growth performance were slightly, but not significantly, better in the nearshore cultivated mussels. These findings correspond with the higher contaminant concentrations in the softbodies of mussels and the water column from the offshore testing site. Both sites showed low LMS values and high accumulations of lipofuscin and neutral lipids, indicating that environmental conditions in the German Bight are generating stress for blue mussels even in the offshore areas.

Short Communication: Growth rate of Acropora muricata coral fragments transplanted on dome-shaped concrete artificial reef with different composition. Biodiversitas 20:1555-1559. Artificial reefs are artificial habitats laid in waters by mimicking some of the characteristics of natural reefs; and could be made of different materials, one of which is concrete. Seashell waste and stone ash could be added as an alternative material to the concrete for artificial reefs. The purpose of this research is to access the growth rate of Acropora muricata coral fragments transplanted on the hollow dome-shaped concrete with three different compositions: C1), conventional concrete, composed by a mixture of Portland cement, sand, and gravel (composition was 1:3:2); C2), a mixture of Portland cement, sand and crushed bivalve's shells (composition was 1:3:2); and C3), a mixture of Portland cement, stone waste (stone dust), sand and crushed bivalve's shells (composition was 1:3:3:2). Observation of coral fragment growth was conducted underwater by Scuba diving for six months with observed parameters were fragment length, colony diameter and a number of branching. The highest rate of fragment lengthening of A. muricata coral fragment was at C2 (1.019[plus or minus] 0.081 cm/month) and C1 (1.014[plus or minus]0.076 cm/month). The highest colony diameter increment was also in C2 (1.903[plus or minus]0.212 cm/month) and C1 (1.856[plus or minus]0.219 cm/month); while largest number of branches was also in C2 (13.31 or 2.21 branch/month) and C1 (12.56 or 2.09 branch/month), respectively. Based on one-way ANOVA and Tukey's HSD test (p = 0.05), there is no significant difference in fragment lengthening and colony diameter in C1 and C2 model, yet differed significantly with the C3 model.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,1412-033X,,,,,,,,,,,"Inst Teknol Sepuluh Nopember, Fac Sci, Surabaya, East Java, 60111, Indonesia",,,,2019-10-21,ZOOREC:ZOOR15511073103,,

There is a corresponding scale of cognitive and sensory capability. Coupling hydrodynamic with Lagrangian particle modelling is well established, as is individual based modelling of animal behaviour. These areas have developed rapidly, due to availability of faster computers. These different disciplines have fundamentally different conceptual frameworks, but the combination of techniques offers an unparalleled opportunity to model swimming animals in water more accurately. More accurate models of dispersion, migration and other spatial dynamics would support a better informed ecosystem management and provide methods to define protected areas that are linked in coherent networks. Development plans for tidal power schemes and offshore wind farms mean that predictive models of migrating fish are needed urgently. Statistical models based on correlations become inaccurate as the environments move to previously unobserved states. This is where models based on rules such as individual based models have a unique advantage. I briefly review Eulerian.

The proposed plan for strategic development of CENTEC in 2018-2022, aims at consolidating its core research areas and in developing new research areas that will allow it to continue in the forefront of research worldwide. The consolidation of the core research areas is achieved through the research lines of the research groups: 1. Marine Environment 2. Dynamics and Hydrodynamics 3. Marine Structures 4. Safety and Logistics of Maritime Transportation In addition, the plan for strategic development of new research areas will address: 1. Renewable Energies Offshore 2. Energy efficiency in the design and operation of ships 3. Subsea Production of Oil& Gas4. Blue Economywhich is achieved with the involvement of the various research groups.The renewable energies offshore will include resource evaluation, dynamics, strength, and safety and maintenance of the equipment. The study on energy efficiency in the operation of ships will concentrate on energy efficiency during operations without compromising safety in storm conditions. The study on Subsea Production of Oil & Gas considers the various possible ways of exploring oil and gas in verydeep waters, by giving more emphasis to subsea than to surface production, as follows from the interests of Portuguese Companies in the exploitation of natural reserves in Brazil and Africa.

Nationally CENTEC was rated as EXCELLENT in the 2008-2012 evaluation and ranked:-> 3rd in Engineering Sciences-> 1st in Mechanical Engineering & Engineering Sciences -> 2nd in Marine Sciences & TechnologiesCompared with that period, in 2013-2017 the production of indexed journal papers increased about 100%, while book chapters and conference papers only increased 5%. The details are in http://www.centec.ist.utl.pt/centec_public/CENTEC-Publications2013-2017.pdfThe proposed plan for strategic development of CENTEC in 2018-2022, aims at consolidating its core research areasand in developing new research areas allowing to continue in the forefront of research worldwide. The consolidation of the core research areas is achieved through the research lines of the groups: 1. Marine Environment 2. Dynamics and Hydrodynamics 3. Marine Structures 4. Safety and Logistics of Maritime Transportation The plan for strategic development of new research will address: 1. Renewable Energies Offshore 2. Energy efficiency in the design and operation of ships 3. Subsea Production of Oil& Gas4. Blue Economywhich is achieved with the involvement of the various groups.The renewable energies offshore will include resource evaluation, dynamics, strength, and safety and maintenance of the equipment. The study on energy efficiency in the operation of ships will concentrate on energy efficiency during operation without compromising safety in storm conditions. The study on Subsea Production of Oil & Gas considers the possible ways of exploring oil and gas in very deep waters, by giving more emphasis to subsea than to surface production, following the interests of Portuguese Companies in the exploitation of natural reserves in Brazil and Africa. Emphasis will be given to safety and reliability of production and maintenance planning.Attention will be given to the various aspects of Blue Economy by looking at the interfaces and synergies of activities like renewable energy, offshore aquaculture, maritime operations and other news uses of the sea.It is envisaged to give continuity to Advanced Education through research, providing training to PhD students and experience to post-doctorate researchers, in an environment of wide international research cooperation. Dissemination will also be one of the main directions through the publication of journal papers and participation in conferences as well as organizing international conferences and seminars.The Marine Environment Group will study the marine environment that is important for the activities at sea. The main emphasis is given to mathematical and physical modelling of waves, currents and wind. The group aims at describing the variability of the mentioned phenomena in terms of probabilistic models applicable both to short term and to long term time scales. A particular concern is in the spatial distribution of the extreme values so as to define the areas that are subjected to the same extremes. The other main objective is to be able to predict wind and wave conditions by numerical models both in the hindcast and forecast mode. The performance of the models will be enhanced through assimilation schemes.The objective of the Dynamics and Hydrodynamics group includes the development of advanced computational tools, experimental investigation at model scale and full scale trials, and development of virtual reality models to allow enhanced visualization of the results. Work will concentrate in multi-body hydrodynamics in waves including slowly varying drift forces. Design of mooring systems and assessment of mooring damping. Modelling of wave energy devices and power take off solutions. Methods will be implemented to calculate extreme dynamic loads on floating wind turbines. It is planned to develop a coupled fluid-structure interaction (FSI) solver to investigate the hydroelastic responses of slender ships under slamming loads. Tests with self-running scaled models group will continue and the offline system identification algorithm will be improved. The current Ship Manoeuvring Simulator (SMS), will be upgraded into a Distributed Interactive Simulation (DIS) system. New algorithms are being developed for guidance and track planning and also for coordinated guidance of a group of autonomous vehicles.Ultimate strength is to be studied under different types of loads, fabrication-related imperfections; impact loads and age-related degradation. Fatigue Strength is based on the recent advances in computational mechanics leading to highly detailed fatigue and fracture analyses of ship and offshore structures. Impact Strength of metal and composite structures subjected to transverse impacts will be studied. Experimental, analytical and numerical research will be conducted on fibre-reinforced polymer materials for structural applications. Geometric Modelling of Marine Structures will implement a new prototype system able to support the fast digital prototyping of complete hull structures.The research on Maritime Traffic Safety and Human Factors will develop methods and tools for assessment and management of maritime traffic risks in coastal waters and port areas. Efficient methods for structural reliability assessment of intact and damaged ships and offshore and subsea structures will be developed. Methods for reliability and availability of ship systems, offshore wind farms and oil and gas production systems, including subsea systems and equipment. The general objective in the area of maritime transportation and port operations, considers also its integration in the wider scope of supply chain logistics. It will address port operations modelling, optimization of short sea shipping and economic and technologic aspects of Maritime Clusters.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,UIDB/00134/2020,,,,,,,,Centro de Engenharia e Tecnologia Naval e Oceanica,Centro de Engenharia e Tecnologia Naval e Oceanica,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:15425979,,

The facilitation of recreational boating activities often requires substantial alteration of natural areas, however the environmental and ecological consequences of such alterations are rarely described in the scientific literature. In this study, ecological and physico-chemical conditions were investigated in a recreational boating marina, located inside a marine park on the south-east coast of Australia. Recruitment panels were deployed for 8weeks both inside and outside the marina, and differences in the composition of the developing fouling communities were observed. The recruitment of taxa, which often have short-lived larvae, was increased inside the marina (bryozoans, spirorbids and sponges) while the recruitment of taxa, which often have longer-lived larvae, was reduced or absent (barnacles, solitary ascidians and non-spirorbid polychaetes). Differences were also observed in environmental conditions inside the marina cf. directly outside. The marina environment had higher turbidity, temperature and pH along with higher concentrations of lead and copper in suspended sediments, while flow rates and trapped sediment loads were reduced inside the marina. The differences observed in the study suggest that there may be marked environmental changes associated with marina developments. The potential ecological consequences of these changes should be a primary consideration during the planning process, particularly for developments in locations of notable ecological value.",,,,,,,,,62,0,0,0,52,0,62,,,0892-7014,1029-2454,,,,,,,,,,"Univ New S Wales, Evolut & Ecol Res Ctr, Sch Biol Earth & Environm Sci, Sydney, NSW, AustraliaBatemans Marine Pk, Narooma, Australia",Batemans Marine Pk,,,2013-08-07,WOS:000321828200005,23822594,

Arguello, California. A pilot study was conducted to examine the distribution and abundance of rockfishes around Hidalgo (by scuba and by ROV photosurveys) and at eight adjacent natural reefs (by ROV photosurveys). To test for differences in fish assemblages among reefs using factorial ANOVA, the natural reefs were classified according to two levels each of three factors: ''low'' (0.2-0.5 m) versus ''high'' (>1 m) relief height; ''nearfield'' (<3 km from Hidalgo) versus ''farfield'' (>3 km from Hidalgo) proximity to the platform; and ''shallow'' (113-160 m) versus ''deep'' (195-213 m) reef depth. Fishes were also tagged over natural reefs with breakaway hook tags. Surveys and tagging studies were conducted from July to October 1990. During surveys in July and August, large numbers of young-of-the year (YOY) rockfishes (primarily Sebastes entomelas, S. flavidus and S. hopkinsi) were found in the surface and midwaters around Hidalgo. At the base of the platform, 1+ yr rockfishes (mainly S. entomelas and S. flavidus) were very abundant. When the platform was resurveyed in October, following the first gale of the year, nearly all the YOY rockfishes had disappeared, though the If yr fishes were still abundant at the platform's base. While the ultimate fate of the YOY rockfishes is not known, our preliminary data suggest the hypothesis that Platform Hidalgo acts as a producer of fish biomass by providing recruitment habitat for pelagic larvae to settle and grow before dispersing as small juveniles. Both multivariate cluster analysis and univariate ANOVA show that the rockfish assemblage around Hidalgo is different in species composition and abundance from those over the natural reefs, although several species co-occur at the platform and the reefs. Three-way factorial ANOVA (without replication) suggests that among the natural reefs there are no statistically significant differences (at P less than or equal to 0.05) in abundances of rockfish populations or in diversity of rockfish assemblages due to the effect of relief height, depth, or proximity to the platform. However, pattern-recognition techniques (cluster analysis) reveal distinct groupings of these fauna that are related foremost to reef depth, followed by proximity to the platform and finally relief height. Fish density differed significantly (P less than or equal to 0.05) between sampling times at selected sites. We propose that the factor relief height be dropped in subsequent definitive studies of these offshore reef assemblages. By doing so, the effects of remaining factors, including possible platform effects, on the distribution and abundances of these fishes can be tested with a more powerful replicated factorial design. Sampling also should be conducted on a number of occasions to examine patterns and sources of natural temporal variability.",,,,,,,,,25,0,0,0,12,0,26,,,0007-4977,,,,,,,,,,,"ARTHUR D LITTLE INC,EARTH & MARINE SCI,CAMBRIDGE,MA 02140MARINE RES SPECIALISTS,VENTURA,CA 93001",ARTHUR D LITTLE INCMARINE RES SPECIALISTS,,,1994-09-01,WOS:A1994QB58400065,,

Two key issues emerge from this review: only one sixth of the published applications on the relation between renewable energy and landscape make use of the ecosystem service framework. Secondly, the applications that do address ecosystem services for landscape planning and design lack efficient methods and spatial reference systems that accommodate both cultural and regulating ecosystem services.

Increasing oil and gas exploration activities in the absence of sufficient baseline data in deep-sea ecosystems has made environmental management challenging. Here, we review the types of activities that are associated with global offshore oil and gas development in water depths over 200 m, the typical impacts of these activities, some of the more extreme impacts of accidental oil and gas releases, and the current state of management in the major regions of offshore industrial activity including 18 exclusive economic zones. Direct impacts of infrastructure installation, including sediment resuspension and burial by seafloor anchors and pipelines, are typically restricted to a radius of similar to 100 m on from the installation on the seafloor. Discharges of water-based and low-toxicity oil-based drilling muds and produced water can extend over 2 km, while the ecological impacts at the population and community levels on the seafloor are most commonly on the order of 200-300 m from their source. These impacts may persist in the deep sea for many years and likely longer for its more fragile ecosystems, such as cold-water corals. This synthesis of information provides the basis for a series of recommendations for the management of offshore oil and gas development. An effective management strategy, aimed at minimizing risk of significant environmental harm, will typically encompass regulations of the activity itself (e.g., discharge practices, materials used), combined with spatial (e.g., avoidance rules and marine protected areas), and temporal measures (e.g., restricted activities during peak reproductive periods). Spatial management measures that encompass representatives of all of the regional deep-sea community types is important in this context. Implementation of these management strategies should consider minimum buffer zones to displace industrial activity beyond the range of typical impacts: at least 2 km from any discharge points and surface infrastructure and 200 m from seafloor infrastructure with no expected discharges. Although managing natural resources is, arguably, more challenging in deep-water environments, inclusion of these proven conservation tools contributes to robust environmental management strategies for oil and gas extraction in the deep sea.",,,,,,,,,197,0,0,0,108,2,211,,,,2296-665X,,,,,,,,,,"Temple Univ, Dept Biol, Philadelphia, PA 19122 USAUniv Southampton, Natl Oceanog Ctr, Waterfront Campus, Southampton, Hants, EnglandUniv Sunshine Coast, Sch Sci & Engn, Maroochydore, DC, AustraliaUniv Hawaii, Dept Oceanog, Honolulu, HI 96822 USAUniv Fed Espirito Santo, Dept Oceanog & Ecol, Ctr Ciencias Humanas & Nat, Vitoria, SpainFlorida State Univ, Coastal & Marine Lab, St Teresa, FL USALouisiana State Univ, Dept Oceanog & Coastal Sci, Baton Rouge, LA 70803 USAHeriot Watt Univ, Lyell Ctr, Edinburgh, Midlothian, ScotlandUniv Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Inst Ciencias Mary & Limnol, Lab Biodiversidad & Macroecol, Mexico City, DF, MexicoUniv Aveiro, Dept Biol, Aveiro, PortugalUniv Aveiro, Ctr Estudos Ambient & Mar, Aveiro, PortugalUniv Oregon, Oregon Inst Marine Biol, Dept Biol, Charleston, OR USAUniv West Indies, Dept Life Sci, St Augustine, Trinidad TobagoHeriot Watt Univ, Sch Life Sci, Ctr Marine Biodivers & Biotechnol, Edinburgh, Midlothian, ScotlandUniv Toronto, Ctr Environm Eptgenet & Dev, Toronto, ON, CanadaDuke Univ, Nicholas Sch Environm, Fuqua Sch Business, Durham, NC 27708 USAUniv Georgia, Dept Marine Sci, Athens, GA 30602 USAUniv Queensland, ARC Ctr Excellence Environm Decis & NESP Threaten, Biodivers Res Grp, Ctr Biodivers & Conservat Sci,Sch Biol Sci, Brisbane, Qld, AustraliaUniv Algarve, Ctr Marine & Environm Res, Fac Sci & Technol, Faro, PortugalDalhousie Univ, Dept Oceanog, Halifax, NS, CanadaSouth African Natl Biodivers Inst, Ctr Biodivers Conservat, Claremont, South AfricaUniv Aberdeen, Sch Biol Sci, Inst Biol & Environm Sci, Oceanlab, Newburgh, Scotland",Univ Fed Espirito Santo,,,2016-01-01,WOS:000458351000058,,

In this context, we tested the importance of habitat variables at two spatial scales (patch and landscape) in driving fish community assembly using experimental artificial reefs constructed across a gradient of seagrass cover in a coastal bay of The Bahamas. We found that species richness and benthic fish abundance increased over time, but eventually reached an asymptote. The correlation between habitat variables and community structure strengthened over time, suggesting deterministic processes were detectable in community assembly. Abundance of benthic fishes, as well as overall community structure, were predicted by both patch- and landscape-scale variables, with the cover of seagrass at the landscape-scale emerging as the most important explanatory variable. Results of this study indicate that landscape features can drive differences in community assembly even within a general habitat type (i.e., within seagrass beds). A primary implication of this finding is that human activities driving changes in seagrass cover may cause significant shifts in faunal community structure well before complete losses of seagrass habitat.",,,,,,,,,50,1,0,0,47,0,62,,,0029-8549,1432-1939,,,,,,,,,,"Florida Int Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Marine Sci Program, N Miami, FL USAUniv Georgia, Odum Sch Ecol, Athens, GA 30602 USA",,,,2011-09-01,WOS:000293914000016,21409448,

Information on fine-scale habitat use patterns would be helpful in evaluating this. Little is known about the fine-scale movement patterns of Red Snapper around artificial reefs. The present study examined fine-scale (similar to 1-m accuracy) movements of Red Snapper with the Vemco VR2W Positioning System. This system enabled continuous monitoring of tagged fish from 100 to 694 d. Locations of individual fish were recorded approximately every 10 min and totaled over 1.9 million accurate locations of Red Snapper from August 2010 through May 2012. Red Snapper showed close association with the reef structure (mean +/- SD distance = 26.3 +/- 35.4 m) but differential habitat use in relation to both diel and seasonal periods. Home range areas (95% kernel density estimates [KDE]) were significantly larger during day than night periods and showed the lowest area use at dawn and dusk. Monthly home ranges (95% KDE) and core areas (50% KDE) were significantly larger in spring, summer, and fall than in winter and were significantly correlated with water temperature, suggesting colder winter temperatures reduced Red Snapper movement. Home range area was significantly correlated with fish size (407-590 mm standard length), and the fish in this study showed the highest site fidelity (88% still present after >10 months) of any Red Snapper in other previous studies. Red Snapper also showed use of multiple reefs within the monitoring area, as home ranges (95% KDE) showed a second peak around other artificial reefs.

Five-lined cardinalfish (Cheilodipterus quinquelineatus) were tested in groups with split-branded cardinalfish (Apogon compressus) as a reference species and individually against Apogon leptacanthus as well as conspecifics of another reef site. The group tests showed that both species preferred artificial reef sites that had previously been occupied by conspecifics. Individual C. quinquelineatus preferred scent of conspecifics from their own reef site to that from another site. They also preferred the scent released by artificial reefs previously occupied by conspecifics of their reef site to that of similar reefs previously occupied by conspecifics of another reef site. No discrimination between species from the same reef site was obtained in experiments with individual fish. Our data suggest that cardinalfish are keeping station and are homing by use of conspecific olfactory signals.",,,,,,,,,51,1,0,0,51,0,67,,,0379-864X,1464-3553,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Oslo, Inst Mol Biosci, N-0316 Oslo, NorwayAgder Univ Coll, Fac Math & Sci, Dept Nat Sci, N-4604 Kristiansand, NorwayUniv Oslo, Inst Biol, N-0316 Oslo, NorwayUniv Windsor, Dept Biol, Windsor, ON N9B 3P4, Canada",,,,2006-03-01,WOS:000236252900009,16436688,

The artificial reefs were exposed to the marine environment near the Xuejia Island in September 2015. In November 2015, we collected the first water samples to analyze different reef materials on organism attachment. We found that the biomass of fouling organisms on different artificial reefs followed the order P.P > P.S > CA > P.F > P.C, and the values were 888.29 g/m2, 755.43 g/m2, 752.07 g/m2, 620.11 g/m2 and 402.01 g/m2 respectively. The number of organism species on P.S was 7, and it was 5 on P.F, P.P and CA. We collected the second samples in March 2016 and found that CA still had the largest biomass that was 1956.94 g/m2, followed by P.P, P.F, P.C and P.S on which the biomass was 1601.44 g/m2, 1453.06 g/m2, 1254.63 g/m2 and 1072.43 g/m2 respectively.

AR units supported 20 times the biomass of control quadrates and their enrichment impact was still significant at a radius of 13m away from units. The 13m values were also significantly higher than those of quadrates adjacent to units, suggesting the existence of a halo of relative depletion within the outer enrichment halo. The main species contributing to this pattern was the migrant herbivore Siganus rivulatus. A decrease in grazing resources is thus suggested as an explanation for creation of this halo. The most consistent AR residents were also Lessepsian migrants - Sargocentron rubrum, nocturnal predators which displayed high microhabitat fidelity and a steady increase in density. The 6 species of migrants recorded accounted for 65.3% of the commercially exploitable biomass and 25.2% of the specimens in the AR site.

We quantified the level of vessel activity from vessel traffic data spanning 2011 to 2015. Overlapping these data layers, we identified regions where high vessel activity posed the highest risk to these species. Navy Board Inlet, Eclipse Sound, Frobisher Bay, Hudson Strait and the northern Labrador Shelf were consistently identified as areas of highest risk to multiple species of seabirds in summer and autumn. These waters not only encompass important summer foraging areas near colonies and post-breeding/migratory habitat but are also frequently navigated by vessels servicing busy communities. The level of vessel activity we found for the study area is relatively low compared to waters where many Arctic species overwinter (e.g., Thick-billed Murres off Newfoundland and Labrador).

We deployed reefs of three sizes to aggregate fishes at different densities (and thus different levels of nutrient supply via excretion) and examined seagrass characteristics that reflect ecosystem processes. Responses varied as a function of reef size, with higher fish densities (on larger reefs) associated with more distinct ecological thresholds. For example, adjacent to larger reefs, the percentage of P content (%P) of seagrass (Thalassia testudinum) blades was significantly higher than background concentrations; fish densities on smaller reefs were insufficient to support sharp transitions in %P. Blade height was the only variable characterized by thresholds adjacent to smaller reefs, but lower fish densities (and hence, nutrient input) on smaller reefs were not sufficient for luxury nutrient storage by seagrass.

This type of foundation has been very popular in the oil and gas industry and the current trend is to extend its use to offshore wind farms. Seepage conditions play a pivotal role in suction caisson installation process in sand. Pressure gradients generated by imposed suction inside the caisson cavity cause an overall reduction in the soil resistance around the caisson wall and tip. This transient soil loosening around the caisson wall helps caisson penetration into the seabed. In this paper, we present a study of the role of seepage on the suction caisson installation process in homogenous sand. We also investigate the effects of seepage conditions on soil resistance to caisson penetration with a particular focus on how frictional and tip resistances are differently affected. For this purpose, a series of numerical models are developed using FLAC3D. These models are used to investigate the variation of suction pressure during caisson installation in homogenous sand and to predict the amount of suction required to penetrate the caisson to a certain depth. An explicit strategy is used for each embedment depth, which consists of updating current suction based on displacement history available after the previous prescribed displacement increment. The numerical models are developed for different caisson sizes and wall thicknesses to study the effects of caisson geometry on soil resistance during caisson installation. Problem dimensions are normalised with respect to the diameter of the caisson in order to obtain the results that can be applied to any caisson size. The results showed that suction pressure tends to increase with the embedment depth. Additionally, the overall behaviour and the pressure variation with depth are similar for caissons of different sizes and wall thicknesses. Finally, in order to validate the developed numerical models, data from centrifuge tests are investigated and compared with the results obtained from this study. The developed finite difference models are found to be in good agreement with centrifuge tests, in particular for thicker caissons (t/D = 1%).",,,,,,,,,25,5,0,0,0,0,27,,,1744-5302,1754-212X,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Greenwich, Fac Engn & Sci, Dept Civil Engn, Chatham, Kent, EnglandUniv Birmingham, Sch Civil Engn, Birmingham, W Midlands, EnglandUniv West London, Sch Comp & Technol, London, England",,,,2018-12-28,WOS:000402987000001,,

Beginning in 1967, environmental resource managers and local fishers initiated a project to build an artificial reef using banded, but unballasted, waste automobile and truck tires offshore Broward County, Florida, USA. Estimates of the number of tires placed offshore range between 1,000,000-2,000,000. Since deployment, storm events and ocean currents have caused the bands to give way and the break-up of the reef. Over the years, many tires have washed ashore onto recreational beach areas. Tires that remain in the water continue to move with wave action and currents. Many of these remaining tires have already been forced up against the offshore edge of natural reef with numbers at individual sites estimated in the 100,000's. The objectives of this project were to examine the feasibility of removing the tires as well as gain subjective insight into the impact of the tires on natural habitat. Sixteen hundred tires were removed from the reef edge and recycled. The potential problems arising from the use of tires in artificial reef construction were apparent. Natural reef fauna was broken and buried providing a seascape resembling a junkyard. The shortsighted use of unstable material to construct artificial reefs is an issue facing many coastal areas. Disturbance of this unstable material has futher added to other natural and anthropogenic stresses suffered by the coral reef systems and the wildlife they support. Clearly, unstable materials, such as tires, are not suitable for artificial reef construction. If already deployed, tires should be removed to prevent physical damage to the natural habitat and reduce the related negative biological impacts, in turn, limiting economic loss to local communities benefiting from use of the natural reef.",,,,,6th International Conference on Environmental Problems in Coastal Regions6th International Conference on Environmental Problems in Coastal Regions,"JUN 05-07, 2006JUN 05-07, 2006",Wesse Inst Technol; WIT Transact Ecol & EnvironmWesse Inst Technol; WIT Transact Ecol & Environm,"Rhodes, GREECERhodes, GREECE",16,1,0,0,8,0,19,,,1743-3541,,1-84564-167-1,,,,,,,,,"Nova Southeastern Univ, Farquhar Coll Arts & Sci, Ft Lauderdale, FL 33314 USANova Southeastern Univ, Oceanog Ctr, Ft Lauderdale, FL 33314 USA",,,,2006-01-01,WOS:000239398400021,,

An important factor influencing the success of artificial reefs may be the provision of refuge for zooplanktivorous fishes, which use artificial reefs as a base to forage the surrounding zooplankton. A numerical model was developed to quantify this trophic pathway on a designed coastal artificial reef, using field-parameterised data for zooplankton biomass, current velocity, and the consumption rate and abundance of a reef-resident zooplanktivorous fish (Atypichthys strigatus). The model estimated that this species consumed similar to 2.9 kg (1.0 g m(-3)) of zooplankton per day on this artificial reef, which represents only 0.35% of the total zooplankton biomass. The ability of this artificial reef to support similar to 130 kg standing stock of this species suggests that the zooplankton pathway is a reliable mechanism for fish production. A second model explored the influence of reef size on zooplanktivorous fish densities and the supply of zooplankton required to sustain their consumption rate. As reef size increased, the ratio between the foraging volume and refuge volume declined, meaning that small reefs have lots of food and not much refuge, and large reefs can have lots of refuge but not enough food. This indicates that reef size can be manipulated to maximise fish abundance while avoiding food limitation. Reef size, shape, and orientation should be considered carefully during the planning of artificial reefs, as it can greatly influence the foraging of reef-resident zooplanktivorous fishes and thus influence the entire reef assemblage.",,,,,,,,,57,1,0,0,45,0,59,,,0171-8630,1616-1599,,,,,,,,,,"Univ New S Wales, Sch Biol Earth & Environm Sci, Evolut & Ecol Res Ctr, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia",,,,2015-12-15,WOS:000367393200001,,

Measuring nearly 1500 m2, the reef consisted to four sets of different materials randomly disposed: concrete pipes (N = 12); tires structures (N = 20); and cement tanks (N = 7) and pre-made blocks (N = 4). In order to determine the artificial reef effects on the teleost community, trammel nets were used for monthly sampling the reef site (RA) and on a control area (AC) with sandy bottom.

The sidescan data were processed to remove an empirically estimated average grazing angle dependence on backscatter. The processed data were analysed by forming histograms of pixels extracted from a 20 m(2) box around each ground truth site. A positive correlation (r=0.73) between mean backscatter intensity and mean grain size was obtained, i.e., the coarsest samples had the brightest backscatter. A positive correlation (r=0.59) was also found between the standard deviations of the backscatter and grain size distributions, i.e., poorly sorted sediments gave the most variable backscatter. The performance of the sidescan data was compared to results from a co-incident single-beam echo-sounder RoxAnn survey. The RoxAnn roughness index E I compared well with the sidescan, whilst the RoxAnn hardness index E2 did not. This may be due to a physical link between the acoustic measures.

Predators attracted to ARs can influence the distribution and abundance of prey fish species. Determining the role of predators in AR is important in advancing the understanding of community interactions. This paper documents the effects of predation on fish assemblages of AR located near a coastal lagoon fish nursery. The Dicentrarchus labrax is a very opportunistic species preying on juveniles (0(+) and 1(+) age classes) of several demersal fish species on the ARs. Reef prey and sea bass abundance were negatively correlated. The mean numbers of prey per sea bass stomach increased with the increase of reef fish prey abundance, suggesting that predation has a significant influence, resulting in a decrease in prey abundance. Prey mortality (4-48%) of demersal reef fish associated species depends on bass density. Prey selection was related both with prey abundance and vulnerability. Results showed that D. labrax predation on AR-fish associated species can increase prey natural mortality. However, the role of bass predation on the ecological functioning of exploited ARs is not clear. There may be increases in local fishing yields due either to an increase in predator biomass through aggregation of sea bass attracted to ARs or to greater production. In contrast, predation on juveniles of economically important reef fish preys, especially the most frequent and abundant (Boops boops), can contribute to a decrease in recruitment to the fishery. Our results indicate that inter-specific interactions (predator-prey) are important in terms of conservation and management, as well as for the evaluation of the long-term effects of reef deployment. Thus, it is necessary to consider ecological interactions, such as predation, prior to the development and deployment of artificial habitats as a tool for rehabilitation.",,,,,,,,,28,1,0,0,24,2,30,,,0025-3162,1432-1793,,,,,,,,,,"CRIPSul, IPIMAR, P-8700305 Olhao, PortugalUniv Algarve, CCMAR, P-8005139 Campus De Gambelas, Portugal",CRIPSul,,,2008-03-01,WOS:000253351000021,,

For most engineers, the deployment of an artificial reef ecosystem (ARE) is based on their experience, but what is the effective deployment to produce the higher abundance and to enrich biomass under the finite budget is seldom mentioned. In fact, how to deploy artificial reefs into the selected site and construct an effective ARE is the most challenge to ecological engineers.The main objective of this research is to construct a mathematical model called the deployment of artificial reef communities (DARCs) model, and then to provide a concrete approach for deploying an ARE under the finite budget. The constructing spirit of DARCs model is based on the observations of biologists that a higher complexity of habitat system will increase the species diversity and biomass. The fractal dimension (FD) is applied as an assessing indicator for the habitat system complexity of ARE in this study. In addition, a step-by-step algorithm for achieving the maximal fractal dimension of an ARE through the determinations of the number of deployed artificial reef communities (ARCs), the distance of adjacent ARCs, and the spatial configuration of ARCs in an ARE is presented. A computerized tool written by Fortran program to conduct the design of an ARE as well as perform the simulated analyses is completely proposed, and a case study is followed. The simulation-based analyses of changing budget reveal that the FD of a given region will be constrained regardless of increasing budget. This phenomenon shows that the more deployment of ARCs may lead to waste capital. Finally, a decision support system called DSS(for)ARE is established for the quick-design of an AR ecosystem under the consideration of conservation policy. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

Currently, the technology is not completely prepared for a commercial development and its levelized cost of energy (LCOE) is still high. In fact, there are numerous types of wave energy converters (WECs) in the development phase. Given the differences between them, there are several classifications based on different aspects such as the location in relation to the distance to the coast and the bathymetry, the position relative to the sea level, the size and orientation, and the energy capture principle. However, none of the existing classifications considers the operating range at rated power according to the power matrix of the devices. This paper includes a new proposal for classification of WECs, named OPERAWEC (Operation Waver Energy Converters), with the aim of covering that gap. A methodology to implement the classification to different WECs is proposed, and that methodology is applied to ten different existing WECs (Wave Dragon, Pelamis, Aquabuoy, Archimedes Wave Swing, Oyster, Oceantec, OE Buoy, Pontoon, Seabed AB and Wavebob), classifying them into six different groups (Group I, Group II, Group III, Group IV, Group V and Group VI). Most of them belong to the Group IV and/or Group V, and some of them are categorised into several groups. The paper ends showing how to apply OPERAWEC classification as a part of a screening process for WECs selection in the Spanish Atlantic coast.

An artificial reef project was initiated in the coastal area of Yenne Village on the central coast of Senegal in June 2004 in response to a strong demand for coastal fisheries management and resource conservation in Senegal. The artificial reef consisted of 400 gabions and 75 concrete cubes installed in a 570 m(2) area. We used a modified point-stationary census method with video analysis to quantify fish abundance over a summer and winter season. The results showed a strong tendency for fish aggregation around the artificial reef, while fish aggregation was negligible at the control site. Estimated fish biomass at the artificial reef increased from 0 to 1.7 tn only 1 mo after construction of the artificial reef. The biomass then decreased to around 300 kg in winter. The total fish biomass significantly differed over time (H = 11.674, p < 0.05). At the control site, the biomass was very low in July 2004 (0.8 +/- 0.3 kg), and this trend was maintained throughout the study period. This is the 1st study to quantify fish abundances on an artificial reef in the West African region.

Mortality was also estimated from catch curves fit to Red Snapper and Gray Triggerfish age distributions that were estimated at the study reefs both before (2005-2007) and after (2007-2008) the GPS coordinates of the above subset were advertised to the public. Red Snapper site fidelity (f), estimated by fitting Burnham's (1993) joint encounter model to tagging data, was 12.8% per year; while estimated instantaneous total mortality (Z) of Red Snapper ranged from 0.08 per year during the closed recreational fishing seasons to 1.31 per year during the open seasons. Similar estimates were not available for Gray Triggerfish due to inadequate model structure. Prior to reporting of reef coordinates to the public, estimated Z from the catch curve analysis was 1.04 per year for Red Snapper and 0.56 per year for Gray Triggerfish. After reporting, estimated Z increased from 0.56 to 0.69 per year for Gray Triggerfish and from 1.04 to 1.14 per year for Red Snapper. The low site fidelity and high fishing effort in the region resulted in no discernible refuge effects for Red Snapper. A modest refuge effect occurred for Gray Triggerfish, fish which have been shown to display high site fidelity (>80% per year) to reefs; however, Gray Triggerfish mortality from fishing quickly increased following the reporting of the study reef coordinates.

The following broad classes of shipboard solids were the focus of this study: Electrical Cable, Felt Gasket, Bulkhead Insulation, Foam Rubber, Black Rubber, and Paint. Experiments were performed at 25 degrees Celcius to approximate sea-surface temperatures found in United States coastal areas (shallow/reef conditions). Average leach rates were determined by continuously exposing the solids to seawater under dynamic laboratory-simulated reef conditions for 14-16 months. The PCB mass released from each solid was determined from the PCB mass present in the seawater volume surrounding the solid at sequential time intervals over the course of the total exposure or leaching time. In general, results of these leaching experiments indicate that PCB release from shipboard solid matrices is very low and attenuated to varying degrees as a function of solid matrix type. The shipboard-solid-specific leaching behaviors were quantified as a function of time to evaluate temporal effects related to shipboard solid conditioning and PCB depletion. None of the materials tested exhibited a constant PCB release rate; rather, the leach rates were variable and changed as a function of exposure time. This type of behavior is characterized by an initial leach rate increase, followed by a leach rate maximum, beyond which the leach rate decreases monotonically over a significantly longer timeframe. The required exposure time to reach a maximum leach rate was variable for each solid, from immediate (days) to gradual (months), suggesting differing degrees of initial conditioning for each solid upon seawater exposure. Leach rates observed over the course of each leaching experiment for any given solid were observed to span several orders of magnitude. Upon comparing the leach rate behaviors observed for different shipboard solids, these differences also spanned several orders of magnitude, indicating that PCB release is also affected to varying degrees by different solid matrices. Although these warm temperature teach rates were the primary focus of the effort reported here, these studies were complemented by a set of experiments performed to investigate thermodynamic effects for lower temperatures expected at greater ocean depths (4 degrees Celcius). These cold temperature teach rate behaviors and relative leach rate rankings were similar to the 25 degrees Celcius leach rate results. However, 4 degrees Celcius leach rate magnitudes were significantly suppressed and slower initial kinetics were observed during the initial conditioning period. This temperature dependence is significant for the sinking of vessels as artificial reefs in cold shallow water, in addition to the sinking of vessels in deeper ocean environments. PCB leach rate results and data treatments will be presented, with particular emphasis on using these empirical data in risk assessments evaluating the re-use of ex-Navy vessels for constructing artificial reefs.",,,,,Oceans 2005 ConferenceOceans 2005 Conference,"SEP 17-23, 2005SEP 17-23, 2005",IEEEIEEE,"Washington, DCWashington, DC",3,0,0,0,2,0,3,,,0197-7385,,0-933957-34-3,,,,,,,,,"Space & Naval Warfare Syst Ctr, Environm Sci & Appl Syst, Code 2375, San Diego, CA 92152 USA",,,,2005-01-01,WOS:000238978701089,,

The ichthyofauna was sampled in the dry and rainy seasons using gillnets, and the composition, richness, diversity, abundance and biomass per distance unit were recorded. The availability of potential macrobenthic prey was evaluated using a stainless steel corer for each inter-module distance, and the results correlated with the stomach contents of the captured ichthyofauna. Community descriptors did not significantly change with treatments of reef distance. A canonical correspondence analysis revealed similar fish composition among reef distance treatments, but increased occurrence of exclusive species and habitat-dependent fish with increased distances among reef modules. Non-metric multidimensional scaling showed different composition of fish populations between sampling periods, with a predominance of Sciaenidae in the dry season and Ariidae and Carcharhinidae on the rainy season. The adjacent infauna was not directly related to the ichthyofauna but to the benthic prey, which were possibly using the structure interstices, and small fish.

The abundance of fishes inside the marina was greater than at the breakwater throughout the study, but species richness was higher inside the marina only during the hot and wet period (Austral Summer and Spring). Fish assemblages were strictly different, between areas. Species dominance for each area and at nearby natural rocky reefs was also different. This study shows that artificial habitat causes micro-spatial modifications to local fish assemblages. As spatial variations were related to the behavioural and ecological aspects of fishes, marine facilities should be carefully planned, and engineering principles should be combined with ecological processes to better resemble natural habitats, thereby reducing environmental impacts.

A key proposed advantage of MSP is that it makes tradeoffs in resource use and sector (stakeholder group) values explicit, but doing so requires tools to assess tradeoffs. We extended tradeoff analyses from economics to simultaneously assess multiple ecosystem services and the values they provide to sectors using a robust, quantitative, and transparent framework. We used the framework to assess potential conflicts among offshore wind energy, commercial fishing, and whale-watching sectors in Massachusetts and identify and quantify the value from choosing optimal wind farm designs that minimize conflicts among these sectors. Most notably, we show that using MSP over conventional planning could prevent >$1 million dollars in losses to the incumbent fishery and whale-watching sectors and could generate >$10 billion in extra value to the energy sector. The value of MSP increased with the greater the number of sectors considered and the larger the area under management. Importantly, the framework can be applied even when sectors are not measured in dollars (e. g., conservation). Making tradeoffs explicit improves transparency in decision-making, helps avoid unnecessary conflicts attributable to perceived but weak tradeoffs, and focuses debate on finding the most efficient solutions to mitigate real tradeoffs and maximize sector values. Our analysis demonstrates the utility, feasibility, and value of MSP and provides timely support for the management transitions needed for society to address the challenges of an increasingly crowded ocean environment.",,,,,,,,,296,15,0,0,162,0,330,,,0027-8424,,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Bren Sch Environm Sci & Management, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USAUniv Calif Santa Barbara, Natl Ctr Ecol Anal & Synth, Santa Barbara, CA 93101 USA",,,,2012-03-20,WOS:000301712600069,22392996,

Building artificial reefs requires however a good knowledge of the biological characteristics and behavior of the target species, to be able to answer its needs and facilitate its establishment on the reef. Moreover a good knowledge of the surrounding environment is essential since the prevailing conditions will ultimately determine the performance and perennity of the reef. In this report, we describe 7 reefs that were built in the last 35 years. The purpose is to highlight the important aspects that should be taken into consideration in the future for the conception and deployment of artificial reefs for lobster. In the light of the examples, we present a discussion and some recommendations on the elements that should be addressed for the choice of the reef site, the building of the reef and for the performance evaluation, to determine if the initial goals were reached. Discussion on the choice of the reef site is based on the following six elements: the physical and chemical conditions on the site (temperature, salinity, oxygen, water and sediment contamination), the dynamics of prevailing water currents at small and large scales, the dynamics of the substrate (erosion and sedimentation), the characteristics of the substrate, the site depth, and the presence of conspecifics. The elements considered important for the conception and building of the reef that are discussed include the type of building material, the dimensions of the reefs and their spatial arrangement, the number, form, dimension and orientation of the shelters on the reef and the colonisation of the reef by other algal and animal species. The discussion on reef performance evaluation focuses on the variables to sample, the sampling techniques and strategies, and the sampling effort, depending on the type of reef, initial goals and the degree of precision required. It is certainly possible to build artificial reefs that are efficient for lobsters. These must provide a long-term suitable habitat adapted to the needs of the successive benthic stages of the lobster. The success of any artificial reef project relies on a responsible and effective planning and requires a scientifically rigorous assessment of reef performance in meeting its goal.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,,0,0,0,,,0704-3694,,,,,,,,,,,"Direction Regionale des Sciences, Ministere des Peches et des Oceans, Institut Maurice-Lamontagne, 850, route de la Mer, Mont-Joli, PQ, G5H 3Z4, Canada",,,,2001-01-01,BCI:BCI200100463850,,

The experiment was designed to examine the effect of (1) increased vertical profile and (2) hole diameter on the recruitment and retention of demersal finfish to each of the six artificial reef designs. Increased vertical profile was accomplished through the addition of fish aggregation devices (FADs) to half of the benthic artificial reef units, which were concurrently equipped with large diameter holes (25.4 cm diameter), small diameter holes (12.7 cm diameter), or no holes. Mean abundances of demersal finfish individuals were significantly greater on FAD units than on units lacking FADs. Hole diameter was only occasionally a significant factor affecting mean total number of demersal individuals and species and did not significantly affect estimated average total lengths of species present. Hole presence (both hole diameters) had a positive significant affect on mean numbers of demersal individuals and species.

A study of the post-recruitment survival of coral colonies transplanted onto a 19-year-old AR and its adjacent natural reef (NR) was carried out at Eilat (Red Sea) in order to test the hypothesis that differences in benthic communities between the two reefs are derived from differential survival processes. Transplanted miniature coral colonies were monitored in situ on both reef types. It was found that the survival of those of the soft coral Dendronephthya hemprichi on the AR was nearly double that of those transplanted onto the NR. Similarly, survival of nubbins of the stony coral Pocillopora damicornis on the AR was over three-fold greater than on the NR. We suggest that the observed differential survival resulted from the unique suites of environmental conditions at the two habitats, mainly in terms of sedimentation load and current velocities, yet not from differences in substratum type (artificial vs. natural). The results demonstrate the role played by survival processes in shaping coral assemblages on ARs and NRs, and indicate that post-recruitment survival must be considered when designing ARs for restoration or enhancement purposes.

Benthic macroinvertebrate abundance was highest on reefs spatially separated from salt marshes. Macroinvertebrate species richness was highest on reefs separated from both salt marshes and seagrass beds. Comparisons of predation on juvenile bivalves transplanted to reefs for 7-12 days indicated that survivorship of clams was greatest on reefs spatially separated from both salt marshes and seagrass beds, whereas reef proximity to vegetated habitats dirt not affect the survivorship of oysters, The foraging behavior of blue crabs may explain patterns of macroinvertebrate abundance and clam survivorship among reefs with different proximity to vegetated habitats. In experiments conducted In 30-m(2) field enclosures, blue crabs had higher predation rates on hard clams transplanted onto artificial reefs adjacent to salt marshes or seagrass beds than on reefs separated from both habitats by unvegetated sand bottom. Thus, vegetated habitats appeared to act as corridors by facilitating the access of blue crabs to oyster reefs and enhancing the intensity of blue crab predation.

In the present work, underwater visual censuses of fishes were conducted at both artificial and natural reefs, aiming at verifying whether fishes are attracted or and produced on artificial reefs. Length frequency, mean biomass and frequency of occurrence of four fish genera targeted by local fisheries (Caranx, Haemulon, Lutjanus and Mycteroperca) were compared between two artificial and two natural reefs. Evidences of both production and attraction of target reef fishes by artificial reefs were found. Production is evidenced by the enormous abundance of recruits of a single grunt species, the tomtate (Haemulon aurolineatum Cuvier). The high concentration of adults of predator demersal fishes (Mycteroperca spp. and Lutjanus spp.), present at low density on natural reefs, is the main evidence for attraction by artificial reefs. Results are inconclusive for the pelagic predators Caranx spp. The attraction that artificial reefs exert over large demersal predators can negatively affect nearby natural areas through shifts in predation, competition or nutrient input. Production can affect benthic communities in soft bottoms adjacent to artificial reefs by foraging of reef-associated fishes. Even when unplanned for fisheries purposes artificial reefs are often submitted to commercial and recreational fisheries and, due to the strong attraction they exert over large predators, these structures need harvest regulations.

Offshore windfarms require construction procedures that minimize impacts on protected marine mammals. Uncertainty over the efficacy of existing guidelines for mitigating near-field injury when pile-driving recently resulted in the development of alternative measures, which integrated the routine deployment of acoustic deterrent devices (ADD) into engineering installation procedures without prior monitoring by marine mammal observers. 2. We conducted research around the installation of jacket foundations at the UK's first deep-water offshore windfarm to address data gaps identified by regulators when consenting this new approach. Specifically, we aimed to (a) measure the relationship between noise levels and hammer energy to inform assessments of near-field injury zones and (b) assess the efficacy of ADDs to disperse harbour porpoises from these zones. 3. Distance from piling vessel had the biggest influence on received noise levels but, unexpectedly, received levels at any given distance were highest at low hammer energies. Modelling highlighted that this was because noise from pin pile installations was dominated by the strong negative relationship with pile penetration depth with only a weak positive relationship with hammer energy. 4. Acoustic detections of porpoises along a gradient of ADD exposure decreased in the 3-h following a 15-min ADD playback, with a 50% probability of response within 21.7 km. The minimum time to the first porpoise detection after playbacks was > 2 h for sites within 1 km of the playback. 5. Our data suggest that the current regulatory focus on maximum hammer energies needs review, and future assessments of noise exposure should also consider foundation type. Despite higher piling noise levels than predicted, responses to ADD playback suggest mitigation was sufficiently conservative.

We estimated the spatial scale of movement, activity patterns, and individual home ranges, as well as whether these variables were affected by lionfish size or density.

Acoustic detection of the remaining tagged fish ended prematurely following two hurricanes that passed over the array, which may implicate the storms in displacing tagged fish, causing tag loss, or contributing to lionfish mortality.

The SPUE differed significantly with season, increasing in late spring and peaking during the austral summer months. A significant effect was observed in the number of fish relative to the lunar cycle. All females sampled during the summer were spawning capable, while all those sampled during other seasons were either regressing or regenerating. What these data strongly infer is that the E. itajara spawning aggregation sites have been located in the southern state of Parana and the northern state of Santa Catarina and summer is the most likely spawning season.

Strength, top surface and mid-height cross-sectional deformation, longitudinal and circumferential strains, and the failure mechanism of the tubes were compared, with a significant difference found between the response of the two groups of tests, and with this difference increasing as the magnitude of axial pre-compression and indenter displacement were increased.

Such habitats, when able to move, offer unique environmental conditions, mainly in terms of hydrodynamic aspects. The current study tested whether floating habitats would develop unique communities in comparison to identical fixed ones, due to differences in current regime between the 2 types of habitat. We found significant differences in the hydrodynamic features associated with habitats of different motion capabilities, predominantly in mass-transfer rate, current velocity and shear stress. Floating installations had greater flow velocities and shear stress compared to fixed ones. We suggest that these hydrodynamic features determine the nature of the benthic communities on floating and fixed habitats, as the former revealed greater biomass and less chlorophyll content compared to the latter, while coral settlement was greater on the fixed installations, particularly near the seabed. The motion of floating artificial habitats increased the mass-transfer rate, as reflected by higher current velocities, and elevated the shear stress felt on their surfaces. These conditions encourage massive settlement of benthic macroinvertebrates and determine the community structure of floating artificial habitats in reefal environments.",,,,,,,,,30,0,0,0,23,3,31,,,0171-8630,1616-1599,,,,,,,,,,"Tel Aviv Univ, George S Wise Fac Life Sci, Dept Zool, IL-69978 Tel Aviv, IsraelTel Aviv Univ, Fac Engn, DepFluid Mech, IL-69978 Tel Aviv, Israel",,,,2006-01-01,WOS:000239896600002,,

In order to enhance sealife settlement and protect these strategic environments from trawl fishing, artificial reefs were deployed as an implementation of the regional coastal management and preservation policy. Such reefs are made of a number of monolithic structures, designed so to enhance fish colonization, and are located in the vicinity of the rocky outcrops.Within the MARINA (Modellistica ad Alta Risoluzione Integrata del Nord Adriatico, Integrated High-Resolution Modelling of the Northern Adriatic sea) project, funded by the Veneto Regional government (Regione Veneto - Geology and Geo-Resources Dept., Water Protection Unit), CNR-ISMAR integrated different scientific activities performed on the Northern Adriatic sea (NA) in a high-resolution modelling work for the study of the impacts of some reef systems on local hydrodynamics and sediment transport, with the final aim of providing a support tool for managing and planning the deployment of these structures, often located in the proximity of aquaculture sites.During the study, a three-level step activity was planned. Initially, a statistical characterization of the NA ocean circulation was obtained by means of a basin scale high-resolution (500 m) numerical modelling run. To simulate sea currents the Coupled Ocean - Atmosphere - Wave - Sediment Transport (COAWST) modelling system was used. COAWST relies on the ocean model ROMS (Regional Ocean Modeling System), the wave model SWAN (Simulating WAves Nearshore), and the CSTMS (Community Sediment Transport Modeling System) routines, and in this configuration received the atmospheric forcings from the meteorological COSMO-I7 model.Once the mesoscale hydrodynamic conditions on the Tegnue area were known, a set of super-high-resolution (having grid sizes variable between 0.15 m and 4.00 m) simulations was performed via the numerical model MIKE-3 to provide a detailed three-dimensional description of hydrodynamics and sediment transport processes close to a single submerged monolith, albeit in a simplified domain. For these runs, the hydrodynamic and geometric conditions, as well as the grain size representing the bottom properties, were chosen in order to cover the whole range of statistically relevant possible environmental conditions on the Tegnue area, as resulting from the first step of the activities. The results of the single-monolith runs were assembled by means of a superimposition approach in order to simulate the complex structure of the real systems.Last, the whole data set results, currently describing four Tegnue in different hydrodynamic and sedimentological conditions, were made available via a dedicated user-friendly graphical query tool. The overall results show that relevant suspended sediment concentration increases may occur only during severe storms and in presence of fine bottom material, suggesting that artificial reef systems in the NA, if properly deployed, do not generally produce harmful turbidity effects on the rocky outcrops.",,,,,35th World Congress of the International-Association-for-Hydro-Environment-Engineering-and-Research (IAHR)35th World Congress of the International-Association-for-Hydro-Environment-Engineering-and-Research (IAHR),"SEP 08-13, 2013SEP 08-13, 2013",Int Assoc Hydro Environm Engn & ResInt Assoc Hydro Environm Engn & Res,"Chengdu, PEOPLES R CHINAChengdu, PEOPLES R CHINA",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,978-7-302-33544-3,,,,,,,,,"CNR ISMAR, I-30122 Venice, ItalyReg Veneto, Geol & Georesources Dept, Plans & Programs Water Resources Safeguard PO, I-30121 Venice, Italy",Reg Veneto,,,2013-01-01,WOS:000343761502084,,

Patterns of cytological indices, which are considered as reliable indicators of environmental stressors, have been compared to ten selected reef community indices. The DI showed the highest correlations among community indices to the cytological indices in artificial reefs and high correlation in natural reefs as well.

They use the Wadden Sea either as a stop-over site between the arctic breeding areas and the wintering areas in Africa, or stay in the area to winter. Besides, some species gather to moult in late summer. Most birds staying in the Wadden Sea, feed during low tide at intertidal mudflats and congregate in large flocks at communal high tide roosts. Often, these roosts are found at the edges of salt marshes, on sand flats and beaches or, when foreland is lacking, also at dikes and breakwaters in harbours. Some species also roost at inland pastures and arable fields or in wetlands behind the seawall. The attendance of high tide roosts is highly dynamic and depends, e.g., on actual water tables, distance to the nearest feeding areas, the degree of human disturbance and species-specific behaviour. The safe-guarding of high tide roosts is one of the most important tools for the conservation and protection of birds in the Wadden Sea and can be achieved by the targets set in the Wadden Sea Plan. As part of the Wadden Sea Plan and the Stade Declaration of 1997, a special project was launched to investigate the current status of high tide roosts in the Wadden Sea and to present a review of available knowledge of the distribution of waterbirds at high tide roosts, including knowledge concerning the necessity for undisturbed roosting sites. This report presents a detailed over-view of distribution of waterbirds in the Wadden Sea during high tide and an inventory of protection regimes and potential sources of anthropogenic disturbance for each site. For this purpose, data from mainly trilateral co-ordinated water-bird counts from the Joint Monitoring of Migratory Birds (JMMB), which are carried out in the framework of the Trilateral Monitoring and Assessment Program (TMAP), between 1990 - 2000 were analysed for species which show tidal movements and depend on high tide roosts. These counts are mainly carried out in the Wadden Sea Cooperation Area, but additionally also include agricultural sites behind the seawall (mainly in Denmark, Lower Saxony and the Netherlands), which belong to the network of roosting sites as well and are especially important during exceptional high tides or for specific terrestrial species like Brent Goose, Golden Plover and Curlew. Data on site characteristics and potential sources of anthropogenic disturbance were derived from available trilateral data (Quality Status Report) and expert estimates on the level of human activities. Special caution was taken to provide a similar approach in estimating these levels in Denmark, Schleswig-Holstein, Lower Saxony and the Netherlands. Roosting behaviour in migratory waterbirds is a complex phenomenon. Gathering in large and dense flocks is thought to minimise the risk of predation for individuals by e.g. Peregrine Falcons, but also saves energy when staying close together at the roost. In a dynamic area like the Wadden Sea, actual water tables, distance to the nearest favourable feeding areas, preferred roosting habitat, site-tenacity and social status of the birds all contribute to the actual number of birds and species observed at a high tide roost. As a result, species often use a network of roosting sites. For a species like Red Knot this network might cover an area of 800 km2 within a short run of tidal cycles. Apart from these natural factors, the level of anthropogenic disturbance is one of the most important factors determining numbers observed at high tide roosts and puts an extra constraint on the birds' narrow energetic balance and tight time schedule for migration. Case studies in several parts of the Wadden Sea, point out that recreational activities are the most observed sources of disturbance. This is supported by our inventory, which points out that 80% of all roosting sites in the Wadden Sea is subject to some kind of recreational pressure (36% of the roosting sites when considering only moderate to heavy recreational pressure). Moreover, data on phenology show that the seasonal occurrence of some species is affected by moderate and heavy recreation pressure, i.e. birds tend to avoid roosts visited by many people in the summer holiday season. Hunting is observed at many sites as well (up to 33% of all sites in Denmark, when regarding moderate to heavy hunting pressure). Although hunting on migratory waterbirds has been gradually phased out in the Wadden Sea during the 1990s, hunting on small mammals like Hare is still common practise and also occurs at salt marshes, close to high tide roosts. Other sources of potential anthropogenic disturbance, like civil air traffic, military training activities and wind farms occur at a much smaller scale, although sometimes close to important high tide roosts (e.g. Vliehorsat Vlieland, the Netherlands, which is situated in a military shooting range). In general, it turns out that the largest roosting sites are a result of large intertidal mudflats at close range and low levels (or absence) of human disturbance. This combination is especially found at remote and uninhabited islands, like Suderoogsand, Trischen (both Schleswig-Holstein), Scharhorn (Hamburg), Memmert (Lower Saxony), Griend and Richel (both Netherlands). The outstanding importance of the Wadden Sea has been acknowledged in several international conventions and directives, such as the Ramsar Convention, the Bonn Convention on Migratory Species and the EC Bird and Habitat Directives. These all have been implemented in the national legislation and the respective protection regimes. When regarding Special Protection Sites of the EC Bird Directive and Ramsar sites, which overlap with most of the national protection regimes, most countries have more than 80% of their high tide roosts located within designated areas (for most species also supporting more than 90% of the birds observed). In the Netherlands and Lower Saxony, this figure is somewhat lower since both countries have a large proportion of inland agricultural areas among their roosting sites, which are subject to limited special protection measures. Only in Lower Saxony, important inland sites outside the trilateral cooperation area have been included in SPA boundaries, whereas in the Netherlands these areas were not taken into account in the last update of SPAs in 2000. Especially species like Brent Goose, Golden Plover and Curlew are known to frequent inland roosts in large numbers. More-over, inland roosting sites become important for all species during very high water tables, when regular high tide roosts become flooded. In Lower Saxony, Hamburg and Schleswig-Holstein, nation-al protection regimes have been set up by establishing national parks, which include zoning for different human activities. In Denmark and the Netherlands, a similar approach was followed with the introduction of the Nature and Wildlife Re-serve and the Key Planning Decision Wadden Sea respectively. However, the actual size of the highest protection zone in these countries is smaller than in Germany. Besides, zoning of recreational activities has not been developed here in detail. The guiding principle of the trilateral Wadden Sea policy is to achieve, as far as possible, a natural and sustainable ecosystem in which natural processes proceed in an undisturbed way (Minis-trial Declaration Esbjerg 1991). Three of the four targets on birds, which were agreed upon at the Leeuwarden Conference in 1994, are related to the impact of human disturbance. This report shows that, despite extensive protection regimes, disturbance of roosting birds occurs in all parts of the Wadden Sea. Especially outdoor recreation occurs around many roosting sites and its volume, along with conflicts between tourism and nature conservation, is expected to increase in future (Quality Status Report, 1999). Moreover, recreational activities more and more expand to spring and autumn (although still peak during summer holidays in July and August). As a result, potential conflicts between waterbirds at-tending high tide roosts and recreational activities around these roosts are especially to be expected in May and in July-October. Both are critical periods to birds as they involve pre-migration and pre-breeding fattening and moulting in late summer. In order to reduce this conflict, a spatial and temporal zoning of recreational activities as well as a convincing visitor information system should be further developed. Besides, more information is needed concerning natural flight distances, which can give feed-back in planning public access to areas in the vicinity of roosting sites. For this purpose, also care-fully designed experiments should be set up in order to assess the complex relationships between bird numbers and the level of recreational activities. Also it is important to include management of non-waterbird hunting in trilateral protection measures, especially to reduce impact from hunting in salt marshes or inland roosting sites during high tide. Furthermore, the impact of civil air traffic (including ultra-light aircraft), military training activities and wind farms should be assessed in more detail. Civil air traffic has been largely regulated by trilateral standards now, but severe disturbance is still reported from a number of roosting sites. Military training activities occur only at a few sites, but one of these (Vliehors at VIieland) is one of the most important high tide roosts in the entire Wadden Sea. Establishing wind farms in the Wadden Sea Conservation Area is forbidden now, but conflicts for roosting birds might arise when planning wind farms in inland areas close to the seawall or in offshore areas close to the Wadden Sea. A more careful selection of sites as well as more detailed studies concerning the impact of wind farms for other species than geese is necessary to reduce possible conflicts here. This can also be achieved by a better formal protection of inland roosting sites, which is lacking especially in the Dutch part of the Wadden Sea.",,,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,1,0,2,,,0946-896X,,,,,,,,,,,"Sovon Vogelonderzoek Nederland, Rijksstraatweg 178, NL-6573, DG Beek-Ubbergen, Netherlands",,,,2003-01-01,ZOOREC:ZOOR14002013190,,

In Portugal, seven artificial systems have been deployed along the southern coast of the Algarve. Research to date has focussed mainly on fish populations, particularly those of economical importance. The present work aims to study the macrobenthic communities of the artificial reef structures, as these will enhance the food resources and shelter, making the reefs more attractive to fish. In particular, we experimentally analysed the sequence of colonisation of macrobenthic communities of the Ancao artificial reef system, which was deployed in the summer of 2002. The study of the colonisation of benthic communities was done using samples of concrete cubic units (15 x 15 cm) that were suspended at the reef modules at a depth of 20 m, at the time of the reef immersion. Four replicate samples were collected by SCUBA diving from two groups of the Ancao reef every three months from the starting date. Sampling was done using essentially non-destructive methods to assess the percentage cover of macrobenthic organisms in both vertical and horizontal surfaces. The percentage cover of the taxonomic groups was compared within the different surfaces of the samples and between the two reef groups. The bottom surface of cubic samples had a significantly higher colonisation related to the dominance of barnacle cover, probably due to lower sedimentation levels. Samples from both reef groups showed a similar pattern of colonisation. Barnacles, bryozoans and serpulids dominated the samples three months immediately after the beginning of the experiment. Other invertebrates groups, such as Porifera, Hydrozoa, Anthozoa, other sessile Polychaeta, Decapoda, Gastropoda and Bivalvia, were more abundant after six months of colonisation.",,,,,38th European Marine Biology Symposium38th European Marine Biology Symposium,"SEP 08-12, 2003SEP 08-12, 2003","Univ Aveiro, Dept Biol; Fund LusoAmer Desenvolviment; Fund Calouste Gulbenk; Fund Cienc TecnolUniv Aveiro, Dept Biol; Fund LusoAmer Desenvolviment; Fund Calouste Gulbenk; Fund Cienc Tecnol","Univ Aveiro, Aveiro, PORTUGALUniv Aveiro, Aveiro, PORTUGAL",32,3,0,0,29,2,45,,,0018-8158,,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Lisbon, Lab Maritimo Guia, IMAR, FCUL, P-2750374 Cascais, PortugalEscola Super Educ Joao Deus, P-1269094 Lisbon, PortugalCRIPSul, IPIMAR, P-8700305 Olhao, Portugal",Escola Super Educ Joao DeusCRIPSul,,,2006-02-01,WOS:000234198500030,,

We describe modelling techniques for predicting golden eagle ranging behaviour within a Geographic Information System (GIS). The model, called PAT (Predicting Aquila Territory), used data on ranging behaviour and geospatial factors from two areas of western Scotland. A range centre was estimated from the weighted mean nest site location in the past ten years. Range boundaries were estimated from Thiessen polygons, in the presence of neighbouring ranges, and a maximum ranging distance generated from parameters responsive to local range density, in the absence of neighbouring ranges. The model assumed that eagles did not use the sea or freshwater bodies, and avoided areas of human activity and closed canopy forests. The model also assumed that golden eagles preferred areas close to ridges (and other convex terrain features) and close to the centre of the range. The model output, at 50 x 50 m resolution, was three-dimensional with geographical location as x and y co-ordinates and use as a percentage of total home range use as the z co-ordinate. Comparison of the model's predictions against range use observations suggested that it provided a good fit to observed range use. The PAT model has many potential applications, including the prediction of the likely impact of local developments such as wind-farms and commercial forest expansion on territorial eagles and for providing information useful to managing land use change to the benefit of eagles across large areas.",,,,,,,,,36,0,0,0,35,0,39,,,1424-8743,,,,,,,,,,,"Scottish Natural Heritage, 2 Anderson Place, Edinburgh, EH6 5NP, United Kingdom",,,,2002-12-01,ZOOREC:ZOOR13900034864,,

Vertical variation in fish diversity, however, was generally not accompanied by differences in vertical movements. Carnivores and invertivores were the dominant trophic groups, being found at each depth range from surface to seabed.

No seasonal patterns were detected for Atlantic Sharpnose Sharks, but one individual returned to the study area in all 5 years that the transmitter was active. One Sandbar Shark and one Nurse Shark had long-term preferences (>3 years) for specific sites. Long-distance migrations (n = 7) away from the artificial reef area in the northern Gulf of Mexico were observed for three Sandbar Sharks (588, 589, and 1,894 km), two Bull Sharks (927 and 968 km), and two Nurse Sharks (903 and 943 km), with six of these migrating sharks returning to their tagging areas. Specifically, two Bull Sharks and two Nurse Sharks made winter migrations to the southern end of Florida (Florida Keys), and two Sandbar Sharks migrated to the middle of the west coast of Florida. A third Sandbar Shark made the longest distance migration and moved out of the Gulf of Mexico, into the Atlantic Ocean, and up to the South Carolina coast. Importantly, this Sandbar Shark returned to the same artificial reef where it was tagged and released in the northern Gulf of Mexico after its 3,788-km round trip migration.

Our research is guided by the radical approach to MSP which, at its centre, places the interplay between MSP actors and their stakes. Our approach certainly considers the relationship of MSP with politics and power, questioning the rational choice. Hence, we have selected fishers as a group which is often recognised as less privileged, with no or little influence on MSP. Firstly, using semi-structured interviews, we investigated the ways in which fishers identify the challenges inhibiting their meaningful participation in MSP. The fishers pointed out data and knowledge gaps as well as a perceived limited agency in decision-making. However, misconceptions about MSP, i.e., equating MSP to offshore wind farms, appeared to be the most significant short-term challenge. Secondly, through a focus group with MSP planners, we explored what the planners recognised as barriers to the fishers' active participation, and gauged the planners' awareness regarding the problems identified by the fishers. Both groups, fishers and planners, identified similar challenges. The major difference between these two groups was the issue of who should be responsible for addressing the concerns they identified. We conclude that much of the fishers' reluctance towards MSP stemmed from their negative experiences in previous marine management initiatives, leading to a general lack of trust among the members of this group. We speculate that this lack of trust could have been diminished through a properly implemented stakeholder mapping in the pre-planning phase. However, the schedule stipulated by the EU MSP Directive, i.e., to prepare the plans before early 2021, did not allow the necessary time for the accomplishment of this step. We, thus, postulate that the stakeholder consultation process should be decoupled from formal MSP, and it should be most active in the pre-planning phase.",,,,,,,,,11,0,0,0,1,0,11,,,0964-5691,1873-524X,,,,,,,,,,"Polish Acad Sci, Inst Oceanol, Warsaw, PolandMaritime Inst Gdansk, Gdansk, PolandNatl Marine Fisheries Res Inst, Gdynia, PolandUniv Gdansk, Gdansk, Poland",,,,2019-10-25,WOS:000488137600017,,

The project offers the social science community an opportunity to collect survey data from a representative sample of the German population. Submitted study proposals are evaluated based on a scientific review process. Panel members were initially recruited in 2013 in face-to-face interviews followed by a self-administered profile survey. The mode was chosen by the participants. All participants of the profile survey are considered as members of the panel and invited to the bi-monthly regular waves. The starting cohort encompassed 4900 panelists at the beginning of 2014. In order to compensate for panel attrition, a refreshment sample was drawn in 2016, using the General Social Survey (ALLBUS) interview as vehicle. The initial cohort encompasses German speaking respondents aged between 18 and 70 years (at the time of recruitment) and permanently residing in Germany, whereas the second cohort includes respondents from the age of 18 without upper restriction. The ALLBUS Sample is based on a disproportional sampling of respondents from the western and eastern part of Germany. A design weight that enables integration of the two recruitment cohorts is included into the dataset. For more details, please see the methods reports of the recruitment processes and die GESIS Panel reference paper (Bosnjak et al., 2017).

However, with limited funding for each site, it is important to select the best structural design for optimization of fish habitat depending on both the target species and environmental factors. The reef shapes of each unit structure give different shadow area, void space and surface area, attracting different fish species. The present study was carried out for 5 years during 1984-1988 with various designs of artificial reefs, such as cylinder shapes, turtle blocks, cube and jumbo reefs, in the eastern and southern Korean coastal waters. The dominant fish species and total fish catch was investigated four times a year with SCUBA, underwater VTR and remote operated vehicle. The Shannon-Weiner index was used for the analysis of species diversity and evenness. When the dominant species were analyzed for the ten target species for each reef site, it was noted the cylinder shapes attracted armored rock fish, white corvenia and barfin flounder; turtle blocks saw-edged perch; and cube shapes common sea bass, whereas porgy, flat fish, black porgy, sea bass and yellow tail showed no distinctive preference for reef structural designs.",,,,,,,,,23,3,0,0,11,0,26,,,0007-4977,,,,,,,,,,,"NATL FISHERIES RES & DEV AGCY SIRANG,KYUNGNAM 626900,SOUTH KOREA",NATL FISHERIES RES & DEV AGCY SIRANG,,,1994-09-01,WOS:A1994QB58400047,,

In this regard, this study aims to test solutions, at a preliminary level, for the eco-sustainable reuse of platforms at the end of their extraction phase. In particular, mineral accretion technology is applied by low-voltage electrolysis of seawater due to the precipitation of calcium carbonate on a cathode material in order to assess the protection capacity of the platforms against corrosion. This approach allows the extension of a platform's life under a more sustainable purpose. The results, derived from laboratory and field experiments, will allow us to reduce uncertainties and define the best operating conditions to increase the efficiency of the mineral accretion technology in the marine ecosystem. The data collection on the main parameters that influence the process (i.e., temperature, salinity, and applied current) and the quantitative analysis of the collected material allowed us to acquire a better knowledge about mineral composition and deposition rate.",,,,,,,,,16,0,0,0,4,0,16,,,,2071-1050,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Campania, Dept Engn, Via Roma 29, I-81031 Aversa, Caserta, ItalyAalborg Univ, Dept Civil Engn, Div Water & Environm, Thomas Maims Vej 23, DK-9220 Aalborg O, DenmarkAalborg Univ, Dept Chem & Biosci, Niels Bohrs Vej 8, DK-6700 Esbjerg, DenmarkInteruniv Natl Consortium Marine Sci CoNISMa, Pzzale Flaminio, I-00144 Rome, ItalyPolytech Univ Marche, Dept Life & Environm Sci, Via Brecce Bianche, I-60131 Ancona, ItalyStn Zool Anton Dohrn, I-80121 Naples, Italy",,,,2020-07-08,WOS:000537476200240,,

Phytoplankton diversity index also had obvious seasonal variation. In November, the Shannon-Wiener diversity index, Margalef index, and Pielou index were higher than in May and July. Comparing the artificial reef areas with the control area, the phytoplankton cell abundance of the control in May was significantly higher than the artificial reef areas. In July and November, phytoplankton cell abundance at the artificial reef constructed in 2014 was significantly higher than other artificial reef areas and the control area. The diversity index in both the control and the artificial reef area constructed in 2012 was lower than the 2010 and 2014 reefs, and lowest in the non-artificial reef area. Clearly, the construction of an artificial reef had a significant effect in improving phytoplankton community diversity, but this diversity is not always increasing consistently but fluctuating.",,,,,,,,,2,11,0,0,1,0,12,,,2095-9869,,,,,,,,,,,"Tianjin Bohai Sea Fisheries Res Inst, Tianjin, 300457, China",,,,2018-12-01,ZOOREC:ZOOR15608061876,,

These small reefs served as stepping-stones to increase fish movement between the large ARs and the continuous reef. Species gain and loss curves were compared to obtain deeper understanding of the underlying mechanisms in relation to the theory of island biogeography. We found that AR without stepping-stones maintained up to 57-fold more individuals than ARs with stepping-stones during mass recruitment events that were dominated by the family Apogonidae. However, in-between these mass recruitment events the overall impact of the stepping-stones on richness and abundance was small. By contrast, increasing distance from the continuous reef from 12 to 25 m increased fish richness, although this was confounded with time since AR deployment. Increase in richness with distance was predominantly caused by elevated species gain. Our results suggest that fish assemblages respond in distinct ways to two types of isolation: (1) Increased richness with distance from a continuous reef, and (2) increased fluctuation in abundance with decreased connectivity. The latter may be the outcome of accumulation and then abrupt emigrations of fishes from isolated reefs. This study confirms that the spatial setting of reef patches in relation to larger or continuous reefs alters fish assemblages, which may be important for planning AR deployments that maximizes diversity.",,,,,,,,,18,0,0,0,17,0,19,,,0921-2973,1572-9761,,,,,,,,,,"Yale Univ, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, New Haven, CT 06520 USABen Gurion Univ Negev, Dept Life Sci, IL-84105 Beer Sheva, IsraelInteruniv Inst Marine Sci, H Steinitz Marine Biol Lab, IL-88103 Elat, IsraelBen Gurion Univ Negev, IL-88000 Elat, Israel",Interuniv Inst Marine Sci,,,2011-04-15,WOS:000288807300011,,

These include, among others, the development of wind farms located in the sea and increased numbers of underwater cables. The objective of this study was to determine whether a magnetic field (MF) of 10 mT or a 50 Hz electromagnetic field (EMF) of 1 mT affected the developmental instability of the inner ear organ, which is responsible in fish for hearing and balance, in rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) reared in a laboratory for 37 days (13 days in egg stage and 24 days in larval stage). This was done by analyzing the fluctuating asymmetry (FA) of otolith size. The MF and EMF values applied in this study are those recorded in the vicinities of underwater alternating current (AC) and direct current (DC) cables, respectively. The influence of MF on otolith FA was found to be statistically significant, with the highest significance occurring in the group of youngest larvae of 5 dph (compared to larvae 15 and 23 dph). Otolith FA was also higher in larvae exposed to the EMF compared to control conditions, but the differences were not statistically significant. Thus, we can conclude that underwater constructions and cables which emit a MF of 10 mT or higher can affect living organisms that are within a distance of a few meters, especially those (as in the case of trout) in settled life stages.

Most applications of artificial reefs are underpinned by ecological processes ranging from trophic interactions and recruitment to individual physiology and biogeochemical cycling. Examples concerning three goals are discussed; enhancement of fisheries production, ecosystem restoration, and water quality enhancement. These examples illustrate (1) predictions that can be drawn from basic ecological studies of natural reef organisms and ecosystems regarding ecological structure, processes, and performance of artificial reefs, and (2) how an experimental ecological approach has been (or could be) utilized to elucidate ecological process and yield specific improvements in the application of artificial reefs to achieve management goals.

Several issues have emerged with these sites, including inaccurate coordinates for the original deployment of materials, movement of reef materials by hurricane wave action, structure failure, and deterioration.Emerald Coast Reef Association, a local grop of fishers and divers, partnered with Florida Sea Grant Extension to conduct a side scan sonar survey of selected nearshore reefs in Okaloosa County during 2005. This article summarizes survey methods using recent innovations in side scan sonar technology as well as the survery results.Information systems in conjunction with the use of low-frequency side scan sonar allowed for accurate location of previously deployed reef materials. High-frequency scanning further refined reef material location and was used to evaluate reef condition. Side scan sonar surveys provided the foundation for furture monitoring activities such as video and diving assessments.A number of the structures detected during the survey illustrate valuable lessons for artificial reef deployment and management. Care in the placement of reef materials during deployment needs to be prioritized in order for structures to function as they were originally designed. Cylindrical objects need to be deployed in deeper waters and modified to improve storm stability. Reef deployments made during the era of Long Range Navigation may not have been recorded accurately compared to today's standards. Accurately calibrated navigational instruments and professional records are essential tools for future reef managers.Our experience from these surveys also indicates it may not be necessary to locate all lost reefs, even though fishermen and divers may benefit. Previous research studies suggest that lost reefs are utilized as de facto refugia, potentially benefiting fisheries stocks. Nearshore, however, it is prudent to manage all reef structures closely due to the presence of natural reefs, trawling activity, and navigational lanes.The success of this survey suggests skilled volunteer groups can play a larger role in artificial reef management and monitoring. The capacity to execute these types of projects at the local level complements traditional research information from universities and government entities and is of great value to local artificial reef program managers.",,,,,AFS-Sea Grant Symposium on Mitigating Impacts of Natural Hazards on Fishery Ecosystems held at the 137th AFS Annual MeetingAFS-Sea Grant Symposium on Mitigating Impacts of Natural Hazards on Fishery Ecosystems held at the 137th AFS Annual Meeting,"SEP 05-06, 2007SEP 05-06, 2007",Amer Fisheries Soc; Natl Sea Grant Coll Program; NOAA Natl Ocean Serv; NOAA Fisheries; US Geol Survey; US Fish & Wildlife ServAmer Fisheries Soc; Natl Sea Grant Coll Program; NOAA Natl Ocean Serv; NOAA Fisheries; US Geol Survey; US Fish & Wildlife Serv,"San Francisco, CASan Francisco, CA",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,0892-2284,,978-1-934874-01-1,,,,,,,,,"Univ Florida Sea Grant Extens, Okaloosa Walton Counties, 732 North 9th St, Defuniak Springs, FL 32433 USAEmerald Coast Reef Assoc, Niceville, FL 32578 USA",Emerald Coast Reef Assoc,,,2008-01-01,WOS:000258728300013,,

Using data from a 24-year study of the breakwater at King Harbor (California, USA), annual densities of reef fish larvae were compared with densities observed elsewhere in the Southern California Bight. Larval production at King Harbor has decreased over the study period, as has the size of the fish assemblage. Both declines may be related to recorded increases in water temperature. Larval densities from similar water depths (0-15 m) throughout the bight vary widely between sites and years. However, the mean percentage represented by reef fish among all larvae at King Harbor was 51% during those 5 years for which bight-wide samples were available (35% for all years) compared to 5% in the bight-wide samples. Utilizing larvae of 12 genera of reef fish species common to the samples, five were significantly more abundant in King Harbor samples. Results indicate that the breakwater represents a mature artificial reef and contributes to the reef fish larval pool of the bight, acting as a source rather than a sink.

Muscle stable isotopes exhibited a spatial change from inshore to offshore habitats associated with growth, possibly related to the reef-ward movement of the fish. Otolith stable isotopes of adult fish from CARs were measured in juvenile (from outside the core to the first opaque zone of otolith) and adult (the edge of otolith) portions and were compared with those of juveniles from Setiu Lagoon, suggesting that the adult fish may not primarily use the lagoon as a nursery before ontogenetically migrating to CARs. The effects of coastal currents between monsoonal seasons could reorientate offshore juvenile migration; hence, adult cohorts in CARs may be replenished from various nursery habitats along the coast. Additionally, similarities in the delta O-18(otolith) values of juvenile and adult sections suggested that some individuals may not spend their juvenile phases in shallow estuarine habitats. Based on the findings of this study, we recommend that coastal conservation strategies take into account multiple nursery habitats rather than a single one.",,,,,6th International Otolith Symposium6th International Otolith Symposium,"APR 15-20, 2018APR 15-20, 2018",,"Keelung, TAIWANKeelung, TAIWAN",5,0,0,0,4,0,5,,,1323-1650,1448-6059,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Malaysia Terengganu, Inst Oceanog & Environm, Kuala Nerus 21030, Terengganu, MalaysiaUniv Malaysia Terengganu, Sch Fisheries & Aquaculture Sci, Kuala Nerus 21030, Terengganu, MalaysiaNatl Inst Technol, Dept Ind Engn, Ibaraki Coll, 866 Nakane, Hitachinaka, Ibaraki 3128508, JapanUniv Tokyo, Atmosphere & Ocean Res Inst, 5-1-5 Kashiwanoha, Kashiwa, Chiba 2778564, Japan",Natl Inst Technol,,,2019-12-06,WOS:000498228100004,,

An example is the Kubansk flood in 2012, which significantly affected the sea coast near Novorossiysk, Gelendzhik, and Divnomorsk. The intensive onshore dumping results in the delivery of abundant allochthonous material, bottom silting causing changes in the dominants in the benthos associations, a decrease in the photic layer and the death of the phytobenthos, and also debris formation at the bottom.

The first three counties are closer to the Salvador Metropolitan Area (the State Capital). They include mostly urbanized and developed coastline segments, or sections being developed. The remaining counties present mostly pristine or uninhabited coastlines interrupted by occasional lightly-occupied areas. This study is aimed at evaluating the recreational quality and carrying capacity of these beaches, as well as its ecological constraints, providing scientific basis for local development planning. The recreational quality of these beaches was evaluated based on an approach involving indicators geo-environmental quality indicators (twenty) and available infrastructure (twelve). These indicators were identified and described during fieldwork (data collecting) undertaken between October 2010 and January 2011. The indicators were classified under three different levels of attractiveness: 1 for the lowest and 3 for the highest quality. The average area occupied per person (current scenario) was estimated for all beaches. The available area was measured and the carrying capacity was estimated based on user perception of ideal occupation for recreational activities. According to this approach, the beaches of Vilas do Atlântico, Buraquinho, Itacimirim, Praia do Forte, Imbassaí and Subaúma were classified as providing high recreational quality for their users. Conversely, the beaches of Busca Vida, Interlagos, Santo Antônio, Porto Sauípe, Massarandupió, Baixio and Sitio do Conde were classified as providing low recreational quality. In the first group, most beaches had naturally sheltered areas allowing safe water activities and a reasonable service infrastructure (restaurants and lodging). In addition, these beaches are apparently free of sewage and other man-made structures impacting recreational activities. Most beaches classified as providing low recreational quality offered no naturally protected areas for water activities or acceptable recreational infrastructure such as restaurants, snack bars, restrooms, lodging, etc. Regarding the carrying capacity analysis, the beaches of Buraquinho, Vilas do Atlântico, Ipitanga, Itacimirim, Interlagos, Santo Antonio, Praia do Forte and Barra do Itariri presented recreational area during low tide inferior to 100,000 m², comprising the lowest values for carrying capacity (<10,000 people/day). The study assumes 10 m²/person (user) as the ideal carrying capacity scenario. The beaches classified as having superior carrying capacity are Massarandupió, Sitio do Conde, Baixio and Costa Azul, all superior to 300,000 m² and carrying capacity beyond 30,000 users/day. Buraquinho, Barra do Jacuípe, Itacimirim, Praia do Forte, Imbassaí, Porto Sauípe, Massarandupió, Baixio, Barra do Itariri, Costa Azul and Mangue Seco beaches presented more restrictive carrying capacity limits - based on parameters such as plant cover, vulnerable ecosystems (mangroves, coral reefs, lagoons and dunes) near the coastline and density of man-made permanent structures within the coastal strip (50 meters from the shoreline). Only Ipitanga beach presented less restrictive ecological limits. The reaming beaches of Costa dos Coqueiros Region showed intermediate ecological limits. Therefore, most beaches included in the present study should have implemented tools for limiting their use based on their ability to accommodate users and provide them with recreational services. Although Ipitanga beach has presented less restrictive ecological limits, one must be aware of its low carrying capacity. Tourism and beach development planning must take into account geo-environmental and infrastructure constraints for they will affect recreational quality. Beaches providing superior recreational quality tend to attract more users but occupation must respect local ecological limits. Therefore, each beach must be dedicated to uses consistent with their capabilities and constraints.",,"O litoral norte do estado da Bahia compreende sete municípios - Lauro de Freitas, Camaçari, Mata de São João, Entre Rios, Esplanada, Conde e Jandaíra - em aproximadamente 200 km de litoral. Os três primeiros apresentam um litoral com urbanização consolidada ou em processo de consolidação, já os demais, apresentam, na maioria de sua extensão, praias desertas ou semi-desertas, com pouca ou nenhuma urbanização do seu litoral. Este trabalho teve como objetivo avaliar a qualidade recreacional e a capacidade de carga das praias do litoral norte da Bahia, bem como os seus limites ecológicos, oferecendo subsídios aos planos de uso e ocupação deste litoral. A qualidade recreacional das praias estudadas foi avaliada a partir da análise de 20 (vinte) indicadores de qualidade geoambiental e 12 (doze) de infraestrutura, classificados em diferentes graus de atratividade. De acordo com o método de estudo empregado, as praias de Vilas do Atlântico, Buraquinho, Itacimirim, Praia do Forte, Imbassaí e Subaúma foram classificadas como de alta qualidade recreacional, e as praias de Busca Vida, Interlagos, Santo Antônio, Porto Sauípe, Massarandupió, Baixio e Sitio do Conde como de baixa qualidade recreacional. No primeiro caso, a maior parte das praias apresentou zonas abrigadas para banho e uma boa oferta de restaurantes e meios de hospedagem, não existindo evidências de lançamento de efluentes , nem estruturas antropogênicas que dificultem o uso. Já naquelas classificadas como de baixa qualidade recreacional, em geral, não existem zonas abrigadas para banho nem uma boa infraestrutura turística e de serviços. Com relação à capacidade de carga, as praias de Buraquinho, Vilas do Atlântico, Ipitanga, Itacimirim, Interlagos, Santo Antônio, Praia do Forte e Barra do Itariri apresentaram os menores valores de capacidades de carga (inferiores a 10.000 pessoas/dia), considerando uma área ideal de 10 m²/usuário. Por outro lado, as praias com maior capacidade de carga, acima de 30.000 usuários/dia, são as de Massarandupió, Sitio do Conde, Baixio e Costa Azul. As praias de Buraquinho, Barra do Jacuípe, Itacimirim, Praia do Forte, Imbassaí, Porto Sauípe, Massarandupió, Baixio, Barra do Itariri, Costa Azul e Mangue Seco apresentaram um limite ecológico mais restritivo para a capacidade de carga - estabelecido com base em características da cobertura vegetal, número de ecossistemas nasproximidades da praia e densidade de construções fixas - e apenas a praia de Ipitanga apresentou um limite ecológico menos restritivo. Por fim, recomenda-se que os planos de gestão considerem de forma integrada as características recreacionais das praias, baseadas em parâmetros geoambientais e de infraestrutura, e a sua capacidade de carga, considerando os limites ecológicos e de acomodação destas praias.",,,,,,,3,0,0,0,0,3,7,,,1646-8872,,,,,,,,,,,"Universidade Federal da Bahia, BrazilUniversidade do Algarve, PortugalUniversidade Federal da Bahia, BrazilInstituto Federal Baiano, Brazil",Universidade Federal da BahiaUniversidade do AlgarveUniversidade Federal da BahiaInstituto Federal Baiano,,,2012-06-01,SCIELO:S1646-88722012000200002,,

It is a usually slow deformation of rock resulting from constant stress being applied over a period of time. Sometimes a seismic slip is observed at the ground surface along a ruptured fault that has produced a substantial earthquake. Examples are from the Hollister and Hayward, California, region. Several of the slides are split images of a location, comparing fault movement over the years. Seismic creep is the constant or periodic movement on a fault as contrasted with the sudden rupture associated with an earthquake. It is a usually slow deformation of rock resulting from constant stress being applied over a period of time. Active faults exhibit a variety of deformational phenomena; the most obvious is earthquake slip. In addition, faults may continue to move after an earthquake occurs (after slip), move slowly over time in the absence of earthquake activity (fault creep), or move slowly as pressure builds before an earthquake (pre-seismic slip). Fault creep may be constant over time, or the motion may alternate between periods of slow and relatively rapid movement. Usually, such episodes of fault slip are a seismic-that is, they are not accompanied by local earthquakes. The characteristics of the fault itself and the total mechanical system that produces the fault movement are the major factors determining the type of creep. As more information is acquired about the fault itself and about the stresses upon it, interpretations are made about movement along that fault, including creep. Fault creep (horizontal fault slippage) has been identified on a number of faults around the world including the north Anatolian fault at Ismetpasa in Turkey, along the Jordan Valley rift in Israel, and the Hayward, San Andreas, and Calaveras faults in California. Sometimes a seismic slip is observed at the ground surface along a ruptured fault that has produced a substantial earthquake. For example, along the San Andreas fault near Parkfield, California, offsets of road pavement increased by a few centimeters in the days following the June 27, 1966, earthquake. Such continued adjustment of the crustal rock after the initial major offset may be caused partly by the minor slips that produce aftershocks. They may also result from the yielding of the weaker surface rocks and gouge in the fault zone as they accommodate to theadjusted tectonic forces in the region. Seismic creep, when it occurs in developed areas, may result in structural damage. Creep has damaged the huge concrete-lined water tunnel from the Sierra Nevada that brings water to cities on the east of San Francisco Bay. It has damaged Berkeley Memorial Stadium at the University of California and the Almaden Cienega Winery near Hollister. The tunnel and the stadium straddle the active Hayward fault which is undergoing right-lateral slip at the rate of 2 to 5 millimeters a year. When the tunnel was drained in 1966, cracks several centimeters across were discovered. These encircled the concrete lining where the tunnel and fault zone intersect. A concrete drainage culvert under the stadium shows considerable cracking where it crosses the Hayward fault trace; instruments that were placed across the cracks in 1966 show that the right-lateral slipcontinues to occur. Obviously, faults should be avoided when considering locations for man-made structures. When utility lines, roads, and railroads must be laid across active faults, they should have jointed or flexible sections within the fault zone.

Based on the bottom artificial reefs and surface kelp culture facilities in the Xiangshan Bay sea ranch, we proposed systematic techniques related to acoustic conditioning of the black seabream (Sparus macrocephalus). Experiments conducted in 12 m x 10 m x 1.6 m ponds on Xixuan Island showed that black seabream was positively sensitive to 500-600 Hz periodic signals. Conditioned responses were apparent after 8 d. Two to three days were required for recovery of the memory of a conditioned response after a 20-day interval. According to the practical application requirements in the open sea, unattended acoustic conditioning equipment was developed. The ranching equipment was used in 12 m x 12 m x 2.5 m cages, and the behavior of black seabream juveniles was successfully guided after 7 days. Of the 16000 released fish, 82.5% of them were conditioned with a flexible grading net. To avoid inducing a stress response, the juveniles were released into the sea ranch in situ from the net cage. The acoustic conditioning equipments were moved into the open sea and the aggregation phenomenon of the released fish was observed when the sound was played. After 6 months of investigation and based on Sr+ marking, only one acoustically conditioned fish was found outside the 3.5-km(2) sea ranch area, thereby reached the goal of guiding activity. The practical effect in the Xiangshan Bay sea ranch showed the validity of the acoustic conditioning system, which may contribute to improve the operation of the sea ranches in the East China Sea.",,,,,,,,,3,0,0,0,0,0,3,,,1672-5182,1993-5021,,,,,,,,,,"Shanghai Ocean Univ, Coll Engn, Shanghai 201306, Peoples R ChinaEast China Sea Fisheries Res Inst, Shanghai 200090, Peoples R ChinaNingbo Ocean & Fishery Res Inst, Ningbo 315103, Zhejiang, Peoples R China",Ningbo Ocean & Fishery Res Inst,,,2018-06-01,WOS:000431921800024,,

A generalized additive modeling approach was used to characterize relationships between environmental variables and the relative abundance of red snapper Lutjanus campechanus over unconsolidated substrate on the continental shelf (<150 m) of the U.S. Gulf of Mexico (GoM) at three different life stages: juvenile (age-0, <125 mm FL), sub-adult (age-1-2, 125-300 mm FL), and adult (age-2+, >300 mm FL). Fisheries independent data (2008-2014) were used to develop separate models for both the eastern and western GoM, and final models were used to predict the relative availability of suitable habitat for each life stage across the two regions. Predictor variables included in final models varied by age class and region, with depth, dissolved oxygen, longitude, and distance to artificial structure common to most models. Depth was among the most influential variables in all models, and preferred depth increased with increasing size/age. Regional differences in fish-habitat relationships were also observed, as relative abundance of larger red snapper over unconsolidated substrates was more closely linked to artificial structure in the eastern GoM. The location of predicted high quality habitat for juvenile red snapper was greatest on the inner Texas shelf and a smaller area east of the Mississippi River Delta, suggesting these two areas may represent important nursery grounds for the respective regions. Clear ontogenetic shifts in the spatial distribution of predicted high quality habitat were evident in both the eastern (expansion from west to east with age) and western (shift from inshore to offshore) GoM. Given the unique population dynamics between the eastern and western GoM, improving our understanding of spatial and temporal variability in habitat quality may be important to maintaining connectivity between juvenile and adult habitats, and may enhance recovery and management of red snapper stocks in the GoM.",,,,,,,,,22,0,0,0,19,0,32,,,1932-6203,,,,,,,,,,,"Louisiana State Univ, Dept Oceanog & Coastal Sci, Baton Rouge, LA 70803 USATexas A&M Univ, Dept Marine Biol, Galveston Campus, Galveston, TX 77553 USATexas A&M Univ, Dept Wildlife & Fisheries Sci, College Stn, TX 77843 USA",,,,2019-03-28,WOS:000461166300035,30870449,

Our aim was to describe and quantify the dynamic coupling between the distribution of marine species (seabirds) and the natural variability of their habitat in real time through the combination of a high-resolution hydrodynamic model, aerial digital surveys and real-time species distribution modelling. We used a 2-step (delta) generalized additive model at 500 m spatial resolution for assessment and prediction of the changing patterns of wintering red-throated divers (RTDs) Gavia stellata in the outer Thames estuary, United Kingdom. Our dynamic species distribution models successfully resolved the major oscillations in the distribution of RTDs and confirmed their tight association with frontal zones where the probability of prey encounter was higher. The relative model standard errors (%) were generally below 30% in the high-density areas. Area under the curve (AUC) values indicated that the models were capable of distinguishing presence from absence about 75% of the time. The predictive power of the achieved distribution models made it possible to accurately identify areas where RTDs were concentrated. Comparisons between visual aerial and digital stills aerial surveys documented that, in spite of similar patterns, the aerial digital surveys generally recorded significantly higher densities of RTDs than the visual aerial surveys. This study demonstrates how marine distribution models with assimilation of habitat variables from a well-calibrated fine-resolution hydrodynamic model coupled with the use of digital aerial surveys can facilitate the capture of detailed associations between seabirds and their dynamic habitats.",,,,,,,,,17,0,0,0,15,0,19,,,0171-8630,1616-1599,,,,,,,,,,"DHI, Agern Alle 5, DK-2970 Horsholm, DenmarkBritish Trust Ornithol, The Nunnery IP24 2PU, Thetford, EnglandAPEM Ltd, Riverview,A17 Embankment Business Pk, Stockport SK4 3GN, Lancs, England",APEM Ltd,,,2016-01-19,WOS:000368922900017,,

A large number of immature fish and a pioneering biofouling community at 134-D were comparable to the 1989 observations made at 128-A. Further, adult reef-dependent species were observed moving freely between 128-A and 134-D. Observations made in 1989 at 86-A and 128-A suggest that differences were related to the manner by which each structure was toppled and the length of time each had remained undisturbed; differences observed between 1989 and 1990 were related to time undisturbed and meteorological conditions of the winter of 1989; and differences recorded between 1990 and 1998 were related to continued diversification and maturation of the community at 128-A. Observations made in 1991 at 128-A and 134-D suggest that 134-D acted as a recruitment reef as well as part of a reef complex for adult reef-dependent species moving between the adjacent structures.",,,,,,,,,60,0,0,0,43,3,77,,,0007-4977,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1994-09-01,WOS:A1994QB58400066,,

Two typical seabed strength profiles commonly encountered in the field, and identified as critical for potential punch-through failure, were considered: (1) uniform stiff-soft-stiff clay and (2) nonuniform clay with an interbedded stiff clay layer. Three-dimensional large deformation finite-element (LDFE) analyses were carried out with and without simulating strain softening and strain rate dependency of the shear strength. The results were compared with previously published LDFE results and centrifuge test data. A detailed parametric study was undertaken, varying the relevant range of layer thicknesses (relative to the spudcan diameter), strength ratios, normalized strength, and strength nonhomogeneity. Punch-through and rapid leg penetration (for stiff-over-soft) and squeezing (for the reverse) were demonstrated by the penetration resistance profiles and associated soil failure mechanisms. The results emphasized that the resistance profile from a spudcan continuous penetration in a three-layer sediment (e.g., stiff-soft-stiff) may be significantly different from the combined profiles resulting from two separate analyses on first-second layers and second-third layers, even if an appropriate depth factor is accounted for. For uniform stiff-soft-stiff clays, the presence of the bottom stiff clay layer within a short distance of one diameter affected spudcan bearing response in the top layer and suppressed the potential for punch-through failure (apart from rapid leg run for t(1)/D = 0.75 and s(u1s)/s(u2) = 3). A trapped soil plug beneath the advancing spudcan, following penetration of the top stiff layer, caused the bottom stiff layer to be sensed earlier and led to enhancement of the limiting squeezing depth. For nonuniform clay with an interbedded stiff layer, spudcan bearing response was dominated by squeezing (with limiting squeezing depth of approximately 0.18D) in the top soft layer and potential punch-through and rapid leg run (for t(2)/D >= 0.5 and s(u2)/s(u3s) = 2.5) in the middle and bottom layers. In contrast to ISO recommendations, the soft soils in between the advancing spudcan base and the stronger layer did not squeeze out completely. Instead, some of the trapped material was forced into the underlying stronger layer. Punch-through distance was found to reduce significantly with increasing positive strength gradient of the bottom layer.

But converting sea wavemotion into electrical energy is challenging, in part due to the relatively low speeds andirregular movements of ocean waves.WITT Ltd (WL) has devised a technological innovation in energy generation called the WITTthat has the capability to harness wave energy. The innovation concerns a patentedtransmission system that converts mechanical motion in the full six degrees,up and down,back and forth, side to side, into a single unidirectional rotation used to drive an efficientgenerator for the production of electricity. No other transmission is capable of collecting allof this chaotic motion and turning it into useable power. WITTs can be scaled to any size andfitted within different enclosures dependent on the application. Sealed unit operation ispotentially maintenance free and suitable for marine environments. It can also be built fromtried and tested industry components. For this reason the WITT provides a far morecompelling marine energy harvesting device than is currently available.This project will create a prototype unit capable of delivering 15 watts for use both in marinebuoys and small boats where naturally occurring motional energy can be converted intousable power. Many marine buoys require electrical power for instrumentation and lightingdevices. Solar PV is often used but has daylight use limitations and requires extensive batterysupport. Small marine vessels, yachts, motor boats, etc also can use of solar PV with thesame limitations. Small wind turbines are also used but are noisy and only work in windyconditions. Otherwise electricity is sourced from diesel power.This project will demonstrate WITTs in marine buoy and small vessel use to show itscompelling energy harvesting capability and will demonstrate the cost and environmentalsavings than can be achieved by generating electricity from a WITT compared to diesel for allsmall vessels.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,720460,,,,,,,,Witt Limited,Witt Limited,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:15312590,,

Mt. Saint Helens is located in southwest Washington in the Cascade Range, a mountain range dominated by periodically active volcanic peaks. In addition to photos taken on May 18, 1980, this slide set includes images of pre-eruption activity and post-eruption effects such as the blast area, mud flows, ash fall, and altered terrain. The Juan de Fuca Plate is colliding with the North American Plate in the Cascadia Subduction Zone off the coast of Oregon and Washington. Geologists and volcanologists had been studying Mount Saint Helens in the 1970s and had predicted an eruption before the end of the century. The mountain had been recognized as a dormant volcano that had erupted intermittently from 1831 to 1857. The Klickitat Indians of the Pacific Northwest called Mount Saint Helens Louwala-Clough or Smoking Mountain. However, the beautiful snow-covered peak looked serene to the casual observer just days before the start of eruptive activity. On March 20, 1980, seismographs in Washington and Oregon began recording earthquakes and a rhythmic ground shaking known as harmonic tremor (anindicator of the subsurface motion of gases or magma). A series of phreatic (steam) eruptions began on March 27. Shortly after the start of eruptive activity geologists noticed another sinister indicator of impending disaster. The north flank of the mountain had begun to swell. Aerial photos indicated that this bulge increased the height of some areas of the north side of the mountain by more than 450 feet. On May 18, the bulge collapsed, triggering the eruption. The sequence of events on May 18 began with a magnitude 5.1 earthquake. The shaking caused a massive landslide on the unstable north side-one of the largest landslides in historic times. Removal of this overburden resulted in the release of trapped gases that combined with steam from water, melted ice, and snow. This massive uncorking of the volcano produced a lateral blast that downed trees up to 19 miles from the volcano. The blast hurled nearly a cubic mile of Mount Saint Helens across the landscape and into the atmosphere. The mountain lost about one-seventh of its original height, dropping from 9,700 feet to 8,400 feet. An ash cloud of new magmatic material and steam reached an altitude of more than 16 miles in ten minutes. The cloud, driven by the prevailing winds, traveled in an east-northeasterly direction and deposited ash in eleven states and reached as far east as Wisconsin. Pyroclastic flows (gravity flows of volcanic material that has been explosively ejected from a volcanic event) periodically poured out of thecrater and down the north flank into the valley below. These flows, along wth hot ash and debris, began melting the snow and ice that remained onthe flanks of the mountain. The debris-filled water, together with ground water and rain water, raised Spirit Lake 200 feet and created mudflows which moved down the Toutle River valley and the Pine Creek drainage. The eruption resulted in scores of injuries and the loss of 60 lives. The lateral blast, debris avalanche, mudflows, and flooding caused extensive damage. All buildings and related man-made structures in the vicinity of Spirit Lake were damaged or buried. Two hundred houses were destroyed and many more were damaged in Skamania and Cowlitz Counties, leaving many homeless. Many tens of thousands of acres of forest land as well as recreational sites, trails, and four billion board feet of salable timber were destroyed or damaged. More than 185 miles of highways and roads and 15 miles of railways were destroyed or extensively damaged. Wildlife suffered heavily in the area. Many agricultural crops were destroyed downwind of the volcano. State and Federal agencies estimated that over 2.4million cubic yards of ash, equivalent to 900,000 tons in weight, were removed from highways and airports at a cost of $2.2 million. The total cost of the destruction and damage caused by Mount Saint Helens was about $1 billion.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2018-03-15,DRCI:DATA2018041012515859,,

Differences in composition of macrobenthic communities were found to be related to the bottom sedimentology and the composition and geometry of the investigated structures. The iron, flat, and even substrata of shipwrecks were dominated by Bivalvia (Ostrea edulis) and Anthozoa (Corynactis viridis), whereas the aluminum, cage-like structure of the airplane was dominated by massive sponges and bryozoans. Furthermore, abundances of some macrobenthic invertebrates were greater on the wrecks than those observed on natural, rocky substrates.

To better understand the hydrodynamic and morphodynamic roles of an artificial reef (AR) in beach protection, a series of experiments were conducted in a 50 m-long wave flume configured with a 1:10 sloping beach and a model AR (1.8 m long x 0.3 m high) with 0.2 m submergence depth. Five regular and five irregular wave conditions were generated on two types of beach profiles (with/without model AR) to study the cross-shore hydrodynamic and morphological evolution process. The influences of AR on the processes are concluded as follows: (1) AR significantly decreases the incident wave energy, and its dissipation effect differs for higher and lower harmonics under irregular wave climates; (2) AR changes the cross-shore patterns of hydrodynamic factors (significant wave height, wave skewness and asymmetry, and undertow), leading to the movement of shoaling and breaking zones; (3) the beach evolution is characterized by a sandbar and a scarp which respectively sit at a higher and lower location on the profile with AR than natural beach without AR; (4) the cross-shore morphological features indicate that AR can lead to beach state transformation toward reflective state; (5) the scarp retreat process can be described by a model where the scarp location depends linearly on the natural exponential of time with the fitting parameters determined by wave run-up reduced by AR. This study demonstrates cross-shore effects of AR as a beach protection structure that changes wave dynamics in surf and swash zone, reduces offshore sediment transport, and induces different morphological features.",,,,,,,,,7,2,0,0,3,0,10,,,,2073-4441,,,,,,,,,,"Tongji Univ, Coll Civil Engn, Shanghai 200092, Peoples R ChinaDalhousie Univ, Dept Engn, Truro, NS B2N 5E3, Canada",,,,2020-11-18,WOS:000586231300001,,

Surface sediment samples showed no significant textural or compositional difference between sediments near the wreck and those far from it. The large and diverse carbonate-producing community resident on the wreck (dominated by bryozoans, corals and sponges) has not had a measurable influence on adjacent bottom sediments (dominated by bivalves and barnacles), even after 21 years. It is likely that carbonate production on the Rainbow Warrior is insufficient to leave any sedimentary record over the potential lifetime of the wreck on the seafloor, which informs our understanding of the long-term impacts of shipwrecks (and other artificial substrata) on the local benthic environment in shallow temperate ecosystems.

AR units supported 20 times the biomass of control quadrates and their enrichment impact was still significant at a radius of 13m away from units. The 13m values were also significantly higher than those of quadrates adjacent to units, suggesting the existence of a halo of relative depletion within the outer enrichment halo. The main species contributing to this pattern was the migrant herbivore Siganus rivulatus, A decrease in grazing resources is thus suggested as an explanation for creation of this halo. The most consistent A R residents were also Lessepsian migrants - Sargocentron rubrum, nocturnal predators which displayed high microhabitat fidelity and a steady increase in density. The 6 species of migrants recorded accounted for 65.3% of the commercially exploitable biomass and 25.2% of the specimens in the AR site.

Eggs, larvae, and post-settlement juveniles typically show high rates of natural mortality. For example, of the 60 million eggs produced annually by a 10-year-old female, only about 450 would survive to 5 cm, the size at which they enter the shrimp fishery. Changes in abundance by size and age appear to be consistent with density dependence in survival rate from ages 0 to 1 and likely ages 0 to 2. Red snapper are attracted to structure or reef habitat at all ages, but larger, older fish also occur over open habitat once they have reached a size that renders them largely invulnerable to predation. Artificial reefs comprise a small fraction of the overall high-relief reef habitat, but harbor a large fraction of the present-day age 2 red snapper populations. Prior to the proliferation of artificial reefs in the northern Gulf, age 2 red snapper may have historically occurred mainly over open-bottom, sand-mud benthic habitat where natural and shrimp trawl bycatch mortality was high. Age 2 fish dominate red snapper populations at artificial reefs, whereas the age composition of red snapper at natural reefs usually show older ages are dominant. The present day red snapper fishery is heavily dependent on catches at artificial reefs. Evidence is presented that suggests red snapper production in the northern Gulf likely has been increased by the establishment of significant numbers of artificial reefs.",,,,,,,,,140,3,0,0,120,0,204,,,1064-1262,1547-6553,,,,,,,,,,"LGL Ecological Res Associates Inc, Bryan, TX 77801 USAAuburn Univ, Dept Fisheries & Allied Aquacultures, Auburn, AL 36849 USAGazey Res, Victoria, BC, Canada",LGL Ecological Res Associates IncGazey Res,,,2009-01-01,WOS:000263995500002,,

Recent research, however, suggests the most complex habitats may not harbor the highest density of individuals and number of species, especially in areas with elevated human influence. Understanding nuances in relationships between habitat heterogeneity and ecological communities is warranted to guide habitat-focused conservation and management efforts. We conducted fish and structural habitat surveys of thirty warm-temperate reefs on the southeastern US continental shelf to quantify how structural complexity influences fish communities. We found that intermediate complexity maximizes fish abundance on natural and artificial reefs, as well as species richness on natural reefs, challenging the current paradigm that abundance and other fish community metrics increase with increasing complexity. Naturally occurring rocky reefs of flat and complex morphologies supported equivalent abundance, biomass, species richness, and community composition of fishes. For flat and complex morphologies of rocky reefs to receive equal consideration as essential fish habitat (EFH), special attention should be given to detecting pavement type rocky reefs because their ephemeral nature makes them difficult to detect with typical seafloor mapping methods. Artificial reefs of intermediate complexity also maximized fish abundance, but human-made structures composed of low-lying concrete and metal ships differed in community types, with less complex, concrete structures supporting lower numbers of fishes classified largely as demersal species and metal ships protruding into the water column harboring higher numbers of fishes, including more pelagic species. Results of this study are essential to the process of evaluating habitat function provided by different types and shapes of reefs on the seafloor so that all EFH across a wide range of habitat complexity may be accurately identified and properly managed.

In coastal Parana, many factors including shipping, aquaculture and the use of artificial substrates provide suitable environments for the establishment and rapid spread of introduced marine species. To better understand this process, the encrusting community was studied on polyethylene plates (n = 120, 10 x 10 cm) that were placed seasonally at fixed locations on the inner continental shelf to detect non-native species. Of the 62 taxa found, 40 were identified to species, 14 of which were native, 9 introduced and 17 cryptogenic. We found a new introduction while most introduced species were previously reported at a nearby estuary with an international port. Possible complementary explanations for these detections are 1) estuaries influence ecological processes on the inner continental shelf, 2) the study area is near the route of cargo and other ships entering the port, 3) other local vectors, such as hulls of fishing and recreational boats, and artificial reefs link the estuary to the offshore areas. Thus, not only are estuaries invaded by exotic species, but also non-indigenous marine species may be present in the open sea where they are likely to colonize artificial substrates.",,,,,,,,,16,0,0,0,16,6,17,,,1984-4689,,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Fed Parana, Programa Posgrad Ecol & Conservacao, BR-81531980 Curitiba, Parana, BrazilUniv Fed Parana, Dept Zool, BR-81531980 Curitiba, Parana, Brazil",,,,2012-06-06,WOS:000303976100005,,

The system will utilize existing microminiature, multichannel , wireless, programmable Addressable Sensing Modules (ASM's) to sample data from a variety of sensors. These inductively powered nodes do not require batteries or interconnecting lead wires, which greatly enhances their overall reliability and reduces their installation cost. Networks of sensing nodes can be embedded, interrogated, and remotely accessed in applications where visual inspection by people is not practical due to: physical space constraints, remote geographic locations, high inspection costs, and high risks involved for those performing the inspections. The sensors can indicate the need for repair, replacement, or reinforcement, which will reduce the risks of catastrophic failures and would be useful after natural disasters, such as earthquakes, hurricanes, tornadoes, and floods. The availability of critical structural health data on the internet would greatly assist highway engineers and scientists, to improve their working database on these structures, which will improve our understanding of the safety of civil structures and their requisite maintenance. If successful, market potential could be significant, as various task-specific robots can be employed with the systems for remote inspection and internet data delivery from a broad spectrum of structures, such as: bridges, bridge footings, dams, offshore oil rigs, buildings, hazardous waste sites, and nuclear power plants.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,9961188,,,,,,,,MICROSTRAIN INC,,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:13562127,,

Red snapper management began in 1989; the stock is now showing signs of recovery. The Gulf of Mexico Fishery Management Council has been slow to sufficiently reduce catches of the directed fisheries to rebuild the stock in a timely fashion, although compliance with the Magnuson-Stevens Reauthorization Act of 2006 (MSRA) required substantial cuts in the harvest of red snapper beginning in 2007. In our opinion, this could have been avoided if conservative management practices had been adopted earlier. We believe that 'faith-based fisheries' arguments have been used to defer effective management of red snapper in the Gulf, which in turn has strained the relationship between science, management, and stakeholders there. We provide a simple empirical argument and alternate interpretations of a recently published perspective on the historical fishery of red snapper in the Gulf to conclude that the preponderance of evidence used in the agency stock assessment process, and the simple arguments made here, do not support the perspective that the red snapper stock has increased in size sufficiently to defer compliance with the MSRA.",,,,,,,,,88,0,0,0,80,0,112,,,0960-3166,1573-5184,,,,,,,,,,"Louisiana State Univ, Dept Oceanog & Coastal Sci, Baton Rouge, LA 70803 USANOAA Fisheries, Santa Cruz Labs, SW Fisheries Sci Ctr, Santa Cruz, CA USAUniv W Florida, Dept Biol, Pensacola, FL 32514 USAUniv British Columbia, Fisheries Ctr, Vancouver, BC V5Z 1M9, CanadaUniv Florida, Dept Fisheries & Aquat Sci, Gainesville, FL USAAquabio Inc, Arlington, MA USAFlorida Inst Technol, Coll Engn, Melbourne, FL 32901 USAUniv Western Sydney, Sch Nat Sci, Syndey, NSW, AustraliaUniv Washington, Sch Aquat & Fishery Sci, Seattle, WA 98195 USAN Swell Media LLC, Jensen Beach, FL USA",Aquabio IncN Swell Media LLC,,,2011-06-01,WOS:000290577100002,,

In the Asia- Pacific region, particularly in China, artificial reefs are commonly used in the commercial farming of sea cucumbers. However, few studies have examined the epilithic biofilms on the artificial reefs. To gain a better understanding of the succession of epilithic biofilms and their ecological processes in sea cucumber culture waters, two experiments were conducted in culture waters of the sea cucumber Apostichopus japonicus in Rongcheng, China, using artificial test panels. On the test panels of succession experiment, more than 67 species were identified in the biofilms. On the test panels of seasonal variation experiment, more than 46 species were recorded in the biofilms. In both experiments, communities of epilithic biofilms were dominated by diatoms, green algae and the annelid Spirorbis sp. In the initial colonization, the dominant diatoms were Cocconeis sp., Amphora spp. and Nitzschia closterium in June, which were succeeded by species of Navicula, Cocconeis and Nitzschia (July to September), and then by Licmophora abbreviata, Nitzschia closterium and Synedra spp. in the following months. A diatom bloom in the autumn and filamentous green algae burst in the summer were also observed. Ecological indices well annotated the succession and seasonal changes in epilithic communities. Multidimensional scaling (MDS) analysis found significant differences in diatom community composition among months and seasons. Fast growth of biofilms was observed in the summer and autumn, whereas the biomass of summer biofilms was largely made up of filamentous green algae. Present results show that the components of epilithic biofilms are mostly optimal foods of A. japonicus, suggesting that biofilms on artificial reefs may contribute important nutritional sources for sea cucumbers during their growth seasons. Future works should include quantitative determination of the contribution of epilithic biofilms to the diet of A. japonicus, potential roles of epilithic biofilms in regulating the water quality of sea cucumber ponds, and the regulation of epilithic biofilms in sea cucumber culture ponds.",,,,,,,,,7,1,0,0,5,0,8,,,0254-4059,1993-5005,,,,,,,,,,"Ocean Univ China, Key Lab Mariculture, Minist Educ, Qingdao 266003, Peoples R ChinaYantai Univ, Ocean Sch, Yantai 264005, Peoples R China",,,,2017-01-04,WOS:000390003700012,,

Eighty-nine species were cited by the fishers and 44.1% are important commercial fish in the region. The fishers cited five distinct zones used to fish: border zone (68 species), estuary (41 spp.), artificial reef (27 spp.), malacacheta (24 spp.), and open ocean (10 spp.). The fishery resources were classified according to their gastronomic and economic characteristics: primary fish (35 spp.), secondary fish (32 spp.), mixed fish (10 spp.), discarded fish (7 spp.), and fish used as bait (5 spp.). The price of the target species increases along the production chain due to the greater number of people involved, processing costs, and improvement of the product.

These behavioural differences suggested that artificial reefs might be a good area to deploy adult lobsters for re-stocking purposes. The movements displayed by the lobsters during this experiment were not influenced by any of the measured environmental factors, whereas spider crab movements occurred against major current direction, when current speed was intense.",,,,,,,,,4,0,0,0,3,0,5,,,0018-8158,1573-5117,,,,,,,,,,"CSIC, ICM, E-08003 Barcelona, SpainTecnoterra, Associated Unit, Lisbon, PortugalUPC, Technol Dev Ctr Remote Acquisit & Data Proc Syst, Dept Elect, Barcelona 08800, SpainIRTA, Unitat Operat Cultius Expt, Tarragona 43540, SpainConsiglio Ric Sperimentaz Agr, Unita Ric Ingn Agr, I-00015 Rome, Italy",Tecnoterra,,,2014-12-10,WOS:000344606400003,,

Fish were collected from August through October 2000 in the north-central Gulf of Mexico. A total of 432 stomachs were examined, of which 164 (37%) contained prey. Size-class influenced diets; diets of small red snapper were dominated by fish, those of medium red snapper by fish and tunicates, and those of large red snapper by crabs and fish. Red snapper fed on prey from several different habitats. Small red snapper fed mostly on reef and sand prey types; medium red snapper fed on similar portions of reef, sand, and mixed prey types; and large red snapper fed on mixed prey types. Adjusting for fish size, mean gut fullness was significantly lower for the dusk than for the day period. Fish were the most important prey for all periods. The second most important prey group changed with period: stomatopods for dawn, tunicates for day, and crabs for dusk and night periods. Prey habitat type also varied over periods. Sand prey type dominated dawn and dusk periods, whereas reef prey type dominated day and night periods. We used multidimensional scaling analysis to compare the relative influence of diel period to size-class on red snapper diets. This analysis suggested that fish size-class had a greater influence on red snapper diet than did period. However, with size effects removed, red snapper still showed significant diet shifts with periods.",,,,,,,,,38,0,0,0,39,0,67,,,0002-8487,1548-8659,,,,,,,,,,"Auburn Univ, Dept Fisheries, Marine Fish Lab, Fairhope, AL 36532 USA",,,,2003-11-01,WOS:000186618100013,,

Placement of artificial reefs relative to nearby existing artificial and natural reefs can influence fish use of these structures, yet no quantitative guidelines exist for selecting optimal distances between new and existing reefs. Here, we documented fish abundance, biomass, species richness, community composition, and key environmental variables on 24 artificial and natural reefs with adjacent sand flats to infer minimum buffer distances around existing reefs where placement of new artificial reefs should be avoided. At each site, we surveyed 4 transects: one 30 m transect across reef structure and 3 consecutive 30 m transects of increasing distance from the reef across sand bottom. Fish abundance, biomass, and species richness were highest on reefs and progressively decreased across adjacent sand flats. Environmental variables influenced these community metrics, but patterns of fish habitat use persisted. Fish community composition shifted gradually from reefs across adjacent sand flats, with fish communities on reefs most dissimilar to communities on sand bottom farthest from the reefs. A minimum buffer of 60 m (30 m around existing reefs plus 30 m around new reefs) or 120 m (60 m plus 60 m) between reefs would encompass 77 and 97%, respectively, of fishes utilizing sand-bottom habitat around each reef.

The ecosystem-based planning and management approach has developed over the past decades with the goal of reducing this threat by defining planning and management of uses in a way that mitigates negative effects on ecosystem structure and function. For oceans and coasts, marine spatial planning (MSP) can further aid the implementation of ecosystem based management, a widely accepted tenet of planning for the marine environment. It can do so by allocating different uses of space in a way that reduces conflicts for the benefit of the environment. Here, we propose an approach to MSP that incorporates principles of reconciliation ecology for the planning of marine (nearshore) enclosures. The approach supports conservation within and around anthropogenic elements outside of marine protected areas. Since human activity typically involves some damage to natural ecosystem, this research contributes by proposing a way to incorporate ecosystem modeling for MSP that includes human activity. Examining areas of human activity under different management scenarios allows identification of possible trends in human-natural ecosystem interactions. Using such an approach increases marine conservation opportunities, and directs educated and cautious MSP in ways that allow implementation of an ecosystem-based approach.",,,,,Symposium on Ecological Engineering in the Coastal Seascape at 5th International EcoSummitSymposium on Ecological Engineering in the Coastal Seascape at 5th International EcoSummit,"AUG 29-SEP 01, 2016AUG 29-SEP 01, 2016",,"Montpellier, FRANCEMontpellier, FRANCE",4,0,0,0,3,0,5,,,0925-8574,1872-6992,,,,,,,,,,"Technion, Fac Architecture & Town Planning, Sego Bldg, IL-32000 Haifa, IsraelTechnion, Fac Civil & Environm Engn, Haifa, Israel",,,,2018-12-28,WOS:000444614500063,,

The same unimodal response was recorded for abundance and biomass of planktivorous and invertivorous fishes and for Haemulidae, suggesting that this family accounted for most of the temporal variations recorded per species richness and CPUE values. The abundance and biomass of sharks decreased gradually after the first year but increased in the 15th year. While these variables increased steadily toward an apparent stable level in the later part of the study for Scianidae and Ariidae, they decreased linearly with time for Carangidae.

The use of Underwater Visual Census (UVC) by SCUBA divers is predominant; however, remotely acquired video data (e.g., cameras systems, remotely operated vehicles (ROVs), submersibles) are becoming more frequently used to acquire community data. Both remote and diver-based surveys are currently used to survey artificial reef habitat in the Northwestern Gulf of Mexico (GOM) and have associated error due to inherent method bias. Because survey methods that most accurately document the occurrence and estimated abundance of several important fisheries species are greatly needed in the GOM, we compared data collected on the same days and sites from both Roving Diver Surveys (RDS) and micro-ROV surveys conducted on reefed oil and gas platforms. The combined datasets identified a total of 56 species from 22 families, and there was no significant difference in measured species richness between a comprehensive 30 min ROV survey and RDS. Five species of federally managed fish in the GOM were more frequently detected by ROV, as were the majority of species in the Lutjanid and Carangid families. However, abundance estimates from RDS surveys were up to an order of magnitude greater. Multivariate analyses indicated that method choice affected community composition, with Lutjanids and Carangids driving the differences. These two fish families in particular are subject to method bias, probably due to inflated abundance estimates with RDS, or alternatively, deflated estimates from ROV. Although our ROV surveys more frequently detected important fisheries species and produced conservative abundance estimates, a further examination of species distributions on these high-relief platform reefs is needed to fully determine the most accurate survey method. In addition, the attraction and/or gear avoidance of certain species to underwater vehicles deserves further investigation. Overall, our data indicate these methods are viable but the choice of survey method can have implications for the management of certain species, and that careful consideration of methodology is necessary to most accurately document species of interest.",,,,,,,,,15,0,0,0,9,0,20,,,0165-7836,1872-6763,,,,,,,,,,"Texas A&M Univ Corpus Christi, Harte Res Inst Gulf Mexico Studies, 6300 Ocean Dr, Corpus Christi, TX 78412 USAFlorida Atlantic Univ, Harbor Branch Oceanog Inst, 5600 N US Highway 1, Ft Pierce, FL 34946 USADickinson Marine Lab, Texas Pk & Wildlife Dept, Artificial Reef Program, 1502 FM 517 East, Dickinson, TX 77539 USA",Dickinson Marine Lab,,,2020-03-17,WOS:000517656400014,,

The spatial and temporal dimensions of fish behavior (movement and/or vertical migrations) are particularly relevant for rockfishes (Sebastes spp.) because most rockfish species are long-lived and have high site fidelity, increasing their vulnerability to overexploitation. In this study, we describe the short-term (with a tracking period of up to 46 d) spatial behavior, as determined by acoustic tracking, of the black rockfish Sebastes schlegelii, a species subject to overexploitation in the Yellow Sea of China. The average residence index (the ratio of detected days to the total period from release to the last detection) in the study area was 0.92 0.13, and most of the tagged fish were detected by only one region of the acoustic receiver array, suggesting relatively high site fidelity to the study area. Acoustic tracking also suggested that this species is more frequently detected during the day than at night in our study area. However, the diel detection periodicity (24 h) was only evident for certain periods of the tracking time, as revealed by a continuous wavelet transform. The habitat selection index of tagged S. schlegelii suggested that S. schlegelii preferred natural reefs, mixed sand/artificial reef bottoms and mixed bottoms of boulder, cobble, gravel and artificial reefs. The preference of this species for the artificial reefs that were recently deployed in the study area suggests that artificial seascapes may be effective management tools to attract individuals. The vertical movement of tagged S. schlegelii was mostly characterized by bottom dwelling behavior, and there was high individual variability in the vertical migration pattern. Our results have important implications for S. schlegelii catchability, the implementation of marine protected areas, and the identification of key species habitats, and our study provides novel information for future studies on the sustainability of this important marine resource in eastern China.",,,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2016-05-18,DRCI:DATA2016080008563653,,

Although protists play an important ecological role in marine ecosystems, the response of the protist community to ARs is still poorly understood. In the current study, an Illumina sequencing analysis of 18S rDNA was performed, and the diversity, community structure, and co-occurrence networks of protists in the ARs and open sea area (OW) in Daya Bay were described. The results indicated that significant seasonal differences occur in the seawater protists between the surface and bottom of the ARs and OW. However, the protists in the ARs and OW had different seasonal variations. The ARs always affected the alpha diversity of marine protists in different seasons, while the surface and bottom OW sites had different seasonal effects. The ARs sites had different effects on the community composition of the surface and bottom seawater in different seasons relative to the OW sites. The linear discriminant analysis (LDA) effect size (IEfSe) method showed that 85 biomarkers mainly belonging to 11 taxa, including Bacillariophyta, Chlorophyta, and Dinophyceae, were affected by the ARs (P < 0.05, LDA > 2.0). The ARs played an important role in the seasonal changes in the protist community composition and had different effects on the dominant species of protists in the surface and bottom seawater. A redundancy analysis (RDA) significance test showed that the structure of the protist community in Daya Bay was mainly affected by environmental factors, such as seawater temperature, salinity and dissolved oxygen. Compared with the OW group, the surface and bottom layers of the ARs had more complex protist interactions or more niches. The ARs increased the degree of spatial heterogeneity, which may lead to significant niche differentiation, indicating that ARs as habitat factors affect the complexity and stability of the symbiotic network of protists. The results could provide basic data on the response of the protist community to the ARs in Daya Bay and a reference for assessments of the impact of ARs on the ecological environment.

The purpose was the creation of a new concept of the artificial reef for Octopus vulgaris, with a view to establishing new artificial reef sites to be used in the fisheries management of this species (MPA, NTZ or fishing areas). First, the main characteristics of natural octopus nests were recorded (entrance width, length, etc.) by divers. These characteristics were used in the construction of new octahedral artificial reef blocks. The blocks were made of reinforced concrete, in a shape like that of an inverted pyramid, with an upper surface of 100x100x25 cm(3) and a lower one of 60x60 cm(2). Four cylindrical holes each with two ellipsoidal openings were placed in one face and in the lateral edge of the octo-block, to serve as the entrances to the artificial nest. Each nest has a volume of 5000 cm(3). Eighty octo-blocks were deployed as artificial reefs at 10 m from each other at 15 different depths at two sites by divers with the help of the winch of the R/V EGESUF. These artificial octo-reefs were censused by direct observation. Twenty-eight octopuses were sampled at the end of 25 dives. Minimum mantle length of the octopuses was 75 mm and the maximum 249 mm, with an average of 152.71 mm. The average total length was calculated to be 918.57 mm. The weight of the specimens was between 244 g and 7140 g with an average of 2335.43 g.

As the offshore hydrocarbon industry matures, operators and national governments must decide whether decommissioned pipelines should be left in situ or removed for onshore disposal. In most jurisdictions, there is a requirement to evaluate the environmental consequences of different pipeline decommissioning options in a comparative assessment. To do this effectively requires an understanding of the associations between pipelines and fauna. Pipeline operators routinely collect video footage for inspection and maintenance purposes using remotely operated vehicles (ROV). This footage has the potential to provide insight into interactions between the marine environment and offshore pipelines. This study uses inspection footage from eight pipelines to quantify the presence and abundance of species and features listed under a number of EU and United Kingdom conservation designations; 12 such features and species were observed on the pipelines or neighboring sediments. The soft coral Alcyonium digitatum was present in the highest densities on pipelines located on mud, while Sabellaria sp. and Echinus esculentus were more common on pipelines in sand. Gadoids, anemones and hermit crabs were also frequently observed around pipelines. The study identifies the limitations to the use of industry ROV footage for ecological purposes, but shows that with consideration of taxon size, image resolution, ROV speed and altitude, this can be a valuable approach to gain additional insights into environment-infrastructure interactions. The results suggest that removal of pipelines will remove established colonies of epibenthic species, some of which have conservation value. The ecological significance of this loss, however, must be weighed against the broader considerations during pipeline decommissioning including cost, technical feasibility and impacts to other marine users.

We used the monitoring data to identify a series of ecologically coherent regions in which trends in abundance and breeding success varied in a consistent fashion and examined how closely the annually sampled data matched the change quantified by the whole population surveys. The number of ecologically coherent regions identified varied from 2 for the northern gannet Morus bassanus and common guillemot Uria aalge to 7 for the great cormorant Phalacrocorax carbo. Trends imputed for ecologically coherent regions more closely matched those observed between whole population censuses and were more consistent than those identified for more policy-driven monitoring regions.

A long-term study of the successional development of the turf community (sessile invertebrates and understory algae) on PAR began 1 year after reef construction. This epibenthic assemblage plays an important role in the overall community structure of reefs. Surveys of the turf community were conducted on PAR from fall 1981 through fall 1986. To determine if PAR was developing a turf community characteristic of more mature reefs, the study was expanded in fall 1984 to include sampling of two reference reefs-Torrey Pines Artificial Reef (TPAR) and Las Pulgas Reef (LPR). Percent cover of turf community organisms was estimated using randomly placed 0.125 m(2) quadrats. Species encountered were grouped into 24 broad taxa. During the 5-year study, the turf community on PAR became progressively more complex; it evolved from a few pioneer taxa into a diverse community. Development occurred in three ''phases'': (1) Early PAR-dominated by the mud ectoproct (Cryptoarachnidium argilla), (2) Middle PAR-dominated primarily by algal turf, and (3) Late PAR-dominated by erect ectoprocts. Comparisons between PAR and the reference reefs revealed that the assemblage of taxa on PAR in fall 1986 was similar to those on TPAR and LPR. However, abundances of several major components were lower on PAR. Although these differences should decrease with time as development continues on PAR, there will always be some inherent variation caused by differences in reef location and design.",,,,,,,,,14,1,0,0,4,0,15,,,0007-4977,,,,,,,,,,,"ECOANAL INC,OJAI,CA 93023",ECOANAL INC,,,1994-09-01,WOS:A1994QB58400052,,

The frequency control mechanism in an HVDC grid can be either centralized or decentralized. An autonomous frequency control (AFC) is a decentralized control, which does not require communication links between dc grid terminals. In the AFC, the dc-link voltage is used as a medium to reflect the inland frequency change to other terminals. The AFC has some technical and non-technical challenges, especially when the dc grid is connected to more than one shore ac systems. Among challenges of the AFC are the deficiency in meeting grid code requirements, adverse reaction of converters, dc voltage variations, difficulties of offshore wind participation in power markets.

Many countries have been focusing on new energy resources to combat these crises, and offshore wind energy resources are especially attractive; they are safe, non-polluting, renewable, and widely distributed with large reserves, which has made them become the focus of developed countries. However, the distribution of wind energy has strong regional and seasonal differences, which determines the success and efficiency of wind energy developments. Therefore, there is a clear need for resource evaluation and planning in advance in the wind energy development. Previous research has made a great contribution to the evaluation of offshore wind energy resources, mostly through analysis of the climatic characteristics of wind energy. In the actual development process of wind energy resources, these analyses of the climatic characteristics of wind energy provide a reference for site selection. However, after constructing wind farms, to aid their operation, there needs to be a more comprehensive understanding of other factors, such as the short-term forecasting and medium- to long-term predictions of wind energy. This paper reviews the research progress of the wind energy resource evaluations, and then considers where future research needs to focus, for the evaluation of wind energy resources. This mainly includes further analyses of the climatic characteristics of wind energy, short-term forecasting, medium- to long-term predictions, early disaster warning systems, the establishment of a wind energy development index (WEDI) and an integrated application system, in hope of providing a reference for offshore wind power generation, seawater desalination and other wind energy resource developments, and accelerating the industrialization and utilization of offshore wind energy. Doing this will alleviate the energy and environmental crises, and promote the sustainable development of human society. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

As the offshore hydrocarbon industry matures, operators and national governments must decide whether decommissioned pipelines should be left in situ or removed for onshore disposal. In most jurisdictions, there is a requirement to evaluate the environmental consequences of different pipeline decommissioning options in a comparative assessment. To do this effectively requires an understanding of the associations between pipelines and fauna. Pipeline operators routinely collect video footage for inspection and maintenance purposes using remotely operated vehicles (ROV). This footage has the potential to provide insight into interactions between the marine environment and offshore pipelines. This study uses inspection footage from eight pipelines to quantify the presence and abundance of species and features listed under a number of EU and United Kingdom conservation designations; 12 such features and species were observed on the pipelines or neighboring sediments. The soft coral Alcyonium digitatum was present in the highest densities on pipelines located on mud, while Sabellaria sp. and Echinus esculentus were more common on pipelines in sand. Gadoids, anemones and hermit crabs were also frequently observed around pipelines. The study identifies the limitations to the use of industry ROV footage for ecological purposes, but shows that with consideration of taxon size, image resolution, ROV speed and altitude, this can be a valuable approach to gain additional insights into environment-infrastructure interactions. The results suggest that removal of pipelines will remove established colonies of epibenthic species, some of which have conservation value. The ecological significance of this loss, however, must be weighed against the broader considerations during pipeline decommissioning including cost, technical feasibility and impacts to other marine users.

Many features of the aerosphere, operating over spatial and temporal scales of many orders of magnitude, have the potential to be important influences on animal flight, and much as marine ecologists have studied the relationship between physical oceanography and swimming locomotion, a subfield of aeroecology can focus attention on the ways the biology of flight is influenced by these characteristics. Airflows are altered and modulated by motion over and around natural and human-engineered structures, and both vortical flow structures and turbulence are introduced to the aerial environment by technologies such as aircraft and wind farms. Diverse aspects of the biology of flight may be better understood with reference to an aeroecological approach, particularly the mechanics and energetics of flight, the sensing of aerial flows, and the motor control of flight. Moreover, not only does the abiotic world influence the aerospheric conditions in which animals fly, but flying animals also, in turn, change the flow environment in their immediate vicinity, which can include the air through which other animals fly, particularly when animals fly in groups. Flight biologists can offer considerable insight into the ecology of the aerial world, and an aeroecological approach holds great promise for stimulating and enriching the study of the biology of flight.",,,,,Annual Meeting of the Society-for-Integrative-and-Comparative-BiologyAnnual Meeting of the Society-for-Integrative-and-Comparative-Biology,"JAN 02-06, 2008JAN 02-06, 2008",Soc Integrat & Comparat BiolSoc Integrat & Comparat Biol,"San Antonio, TXSan Antonio, TX",16,1,0,0,10,0,20,,,1540-7063,1557-7023,,,,,,,,,,"Brown Univ, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Providence, RI 02912 USABrown Univ, Div Engn, Providence, RI 02912 USAMIT, Dept Aeronaut & Astronaut, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA",,,,2008-07-01,WOS:000257577700008,21669775,

They have been used primarily in relatively shallow water for the placement of fixed, freestanding oil and gas platforms. However, their relevance has changed with the advent of offshore wind farms and the need to understand the underlying geology. Furthermore, the Deepwater Horizon accident has shown that these data are essential to any structure attached to the seabed, not just those that are rigidly fixed. The development of accurate acquisition techniques reduces the uncertainty and increases the effectiveness of these surveys (RenewableUK, 2011). Adapting conventional exploration survey acquisition techniques to high-resolution surveys allows the use of precise positioning systems and robust operational equipment. The result is a three-dimensional (3D) high-resolution (HR3D) survey similar in the visualization offered by conventional seismic surveys but with much higher spatial resolution. The HR3D technique presents some physical challenges in the design of the acquisition system. However, the same technique offers some advantages that simplify engineering. Engineering and adaptation of larger-scale geophysical equipment is straightforward. Furthermore, some methods not viable for use in the exploration survey industry have a use in this application. A series of trials in late 2010 and early 2011 allowed the development of the system with individual focuses on the physical, navigation, and geophysical aspects of the system.

In addition, the differing ecological needs of porgy and sea bass for shelter guided the design of the Box Reef in Korea as a device to enhance productivity of marine ranching. The effect of these and other structures on fisheries catch is positive. But caution must be exercised to avoid using reefs simply as fishing devices to heavily exploit species attracted to them. No worldwide database for artificial habitats exists. The challenge to any ecological restoration effort is to define the condition or possibly even the historic baseline to which the system will be restored; in other words, to answer the question: Restoration to what? Examples of aquatic ecosystem restoration from Hong Kong (fisheries), the Pacific Ocean (kelp beds), Chesapeake Bay (oysters) and the Atlantic Ocean (coral reefs) are discussed. The degree to which these four situations consider or can approach a baseline is indicated and compared (e.g., four plants per 100 m 2 are proposed in one project). Measurement of performance is a key factor in restoration planning. These situations also are considered for the ecosystem and fishery contexts in which they are conducted. All use ecological data as a basis for physical design of restoration structures. The use of experimental, pilot and modeling practices is indicated. A context for the young field of marine restoration is provided by reviewing major factors in ecosystem degradation, such as high stress on 70% of commercially valuable fishes worldwide. Examples of habitat disruption include an extensive hypoxic/anoxic zone in the Gulf of Mexico and nutrient and contaminant burdens in the North Sea. Principle of ecological restoration are summarized, from planning through to evaluation. Alternate approaches to facilitate ecological recovery include land-use and ecosystem management and determining levels of human population, consumption and pollution.",,,,,39th European Marine Biology Symposium39th European Marine Biology Symposium,"JUL 21-24, 2004JUL 21-24, 2004",Univ Genoa; Italian Soc Marine BiolUniv Genoa; Italian Soc Marine Biol,"Genoa, ITALYGenoa, ITALY",121,8,0,0,99,1,141,,,0018-8158,,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Florida, Dept Fisheries & Aquat Sci, Gainesville, FL 32611 USAUniv Florida, Florida Sea Grant Coll Program, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA",,,,2007-04-01,WOS:000245895800014,,

Species richness was similar in the two treatments, with 12 species on floating (constant depth) plates and 15 on stationary (variable depth) plates. However, species composition differed, with the community on floating plates being dominated by the native bivalve Mytella charruana (66.1 +/- 5.5% cover) and that on stationary plates dominated by the barnacles Fistulobalanus citerosum (49.8 +/- 3.5% cover) and the introduced Amphibalanus reticulatus (33.9 +/- 3.7% cover). Other introduced species were Garveia franciscana, on one stationary plate, and Megabalanus coccopoma also on one stationary plate and not very abundant on half of the floating plates (< 2%). Thus, stationary plates were more susceptible to introduced species that may become very abundant, suggesting that this type of substrate should be a priority in management for bioinvasion control.

Within the UK the exploitable resource is especially attractive, at 6200TWhpa, ~18 times present UK electricity consumption and hence could provide all of the UK's electricity requirement with minimal emission and visual impacts. More than 5GW of installed capacity has been achieved in UK waters, enabled by government subsidies. The major barrier to further exploitation is that the levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) from offshore wind is £140/MWhr. 2-3 times higher than other key renewable sources: onshore wind, solar and nuclear (a large non-renewable but low emission source). The high LCOE is caused by the severe environment which results in high operational, reliability and maintenance (O&M) costs. Seabed turbine foundations (largely monopile structures) O&M accounts for at least than 25% of all life cycle O&M costs, mostly caused by marine biofouling amounts to 10% of the LCOE. Even with the deployment of state of the art fouling prevention technology, the fouling thickness deposited on foundations grows continuously, eventually causing stress induced corrosion and crack defects. Fouling remediation treatment consists of deploying cleaning tools such as brushes and power jets by divers (which is dangerous) or ROVs with annual costs ~ £30k/MW.The project will develop a fouling management system consisting of a mobile survey robot leading a cleaning robot team that will eliminate be need for divers and ROVs. The team will be placed on the turbine structure at sea level and will journey down below sea level to the work place. The lead robot will travel autonomously over the entire subsea monopile surface, imaging the fouling and measuring its thickness in real time at every location where it occurs. Simultaneously the leader will instruct one or more cleaning robots to every fouled location and remove the fouling with an innovative guided power ultrasound technique. On returning to the sea surface the team would simply be transported to the next turbine scheduled for treatment and the cycle repeated. Overall O&M costs will be reduced by at least 50% compared with present diver/ROV techniques. This would mean a £7/MW (5%) reduction in LCOE. This is a significant contribution to the overall LCOE reduction required to make offshore wind competitive with other energy sources and thus reap the full environmental advantages of offshore wind.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,104079,,,,,,,,Innovative Technology and Science Limited,Innovative Technology and Science Limited,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:15508890,,

The present work addresses this issue to propose environmental management measures connected to the utilization of fishery resources. Offshore and inshore surveys were carried out along the Saudi Gulf waters using trawl and beach-seine nets, respectively. Data relative to only fish (offshore) and fish and invertebrates (inshore) were collected concurrently with several factors: density of oil and gas facilities (offshore), distance to the nearest coastal platform (inshore), oceanographic variables, and habitat characteristics. Results of offshore surveys indicated higher fish density-both total and of fishery resources-in locations with a higher number of oil and gas facilities within a 5 km radius, whereas biomass density was not significantly different. Hence, oil and gas facilities seem to serve as nursery areas for small fish. For inshore communities, more species and diversity were found in stations closer to coastal oil and gas facilities. In addition, among the five coastal embayments sampled, those with more oil and gas facilities had more species. The findings of the present work support the hypothesis of a positive net ecological role of oil and gas platforms of the Saudi Arabian Gulf, with the implication that this effect could be extended to improve the sustainability of important fishery resources.",,,,,,,,,26,0,0,0,25,0,27,,,1054-3139,1095-9289,,,,,,,,,,"King Fahd Univ Petr & Minerals, Marine Studies Sect, Ctr Environm & Water, Res Inst, Dhahran 31261, Eastern Provinc, Saudi ArabiaAZTI Tecnalia, Marine Res Div, Pasaia 20110, SpainSaudi Aramco, Environm Protect Dept, Dhahran, Saudi Arabia",,,,2015-09-01,WOS:000368251600022,,

These limitations can compromise the practical value of wind farm impact studies. We used radar- and observer-based methods to quantify great white pelican flights in the vicinity of a planned wind farm on the Cape west coast, South Africa, and modelled turbine collision risk under various scenarios. Model outputs were combined with pre-existing demographic data to evaluate the possible influence of the wind farm on the pelican population, and to examine impact mitigation options. We recorded high volumes of great white pelican movement through the wind farm area, coincident with the breeding cycle of the nearby colony and associated with flights to feeding areas located about 50 km away. Pelicans were exposed to collision risk at a mean rate of 2.02 High Risk flights.h-1. Risk was confined to daylight hours, highest during the middle of the day and in conditions of strong north-westerly winds, and 82% of High Risk flights were focused on only five of the proposed 35 turbine placements. Predicted mean mortality rates (22 fatalities.yr-1, 95% Cl, 16-29, with average bird and blade speeds and 95% avoidance rates) were not sustainable, resulting in a negative population growth rate (lambda = 0.991). Models suggested that removal of the five highest risk turbines from the project, or institution of a curtailment regimen that shuts down at least these turbines at peak traffic times, could theoretically reduce impacts to manageable levels. However, in spite of the large quantities of high quality data used in our analyses, our collision risk model remains compromised by untested assumptions about pelican avoidance rates and uncertainties about the existing dynamics of the pelican population, and our findings are probably not reliable enough to ensure sustainable development.

This indicates that management and protection of these resources and their habitat are required. Teranas is identified as important critical marine habitat and locally in Malay is defined as a hard rock substrate on the seabed. Teranas can appear in all shapes and sizes, depths, and locations. The combination of these various bottom features often make a teranas attractive to fish. The objective of this study is to detect a teranas so that it can be located and managed through mapping. Sonar in the form of a multibeam echosounder was used to map a teranas with a combination of bathymetry and water column features to identify the signature for teranas. The result produced a signature library to readily identify a teranas with the multibeam echosounder. An important factor in determining the signature for the teranas was the seabed structure and its associated marine life. Bathymetry identified the seabed structure, and the water column characteristics helped verify the presence of marine life. Fishing and visual surveys with scuba diving were also conducted to verify the effectiveness of the multibeam echosounder to identify the teranas. These study results can be used as an aid for planning and managing a teranas to help sustain the associated fisheries resources. Moreover, since a teranas is similar in structure and position to an artificial reef, the multibeam echosounder, when coupled with visual diver-based surveys and fishing effort, could be used to identify the extent and marine fauna associated with an artificial reef.

In addition, despite the proliferation of AR studies, comparative studies between artificial and natural reefs (NRs) are scarce. We present here the monitoring results of initial (1-2 year) and progressed (10 year) stages of the developing benthic communities of a purpose-planned AR submerged at Eilat, Israel (Red Sea), and compare them to its adjacent NR. Visual surveys of macro-invertebrates were conducted on the initial stages and coral communities were characterized at the progressed stage, using belt transects. The results demonstrate a distinct shift in species composition of the AR communities along the monitoring periods from a soft coral dominated community, comprised mainly of Dendronephthya hemprichi, in initial developmental stages of up to two years post-deployment, to a community dominated by the sponge Crella cyatophora at year 10. Distinct differences in coral species count, living cover and diversity were found between the AR and its neighboring NR. We estimate the time frame required to develop a progressed diverse AR community to be well over a decade, even in tropical ecosystems. The factors shaping the species composition of purpose-designed ARs in a coral reef environment, including structural design, spatial orientation, depth and age, are discussed. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

In comparing 12 previous Red Snapper length-at-age (0-25 years) studies across the Gulf of Mexico, results were similar except for two studies significantly different from one another, but none with respect to our study. Our findings suggest that Red Snapper populations are young and restricted to one or two spawning years before capture on artificial reefs.

Ammonium, nitrates, phosphates, silicates, total organic nitrogen and phosphorus, chlorophyll a and phaeopigments were also determined monthly in water samples within AR and control sites. Results of the two-year study showed that: (i) there was a significant exponential fit between organic carbon and chlorophyll a (r(2) = 0.91; P < 0.01) in reef sediment suggesting an increase of benthic productivity; (ii) organic carbon and nitrogen content in settled particles within AR environment was about four times higher two years after reef deployment; (iii) nutrients and chlorophyll a in the water column were higher at AR than control site. Two years after AR deployment, dissolved organic and inorganic compounds in near bottom water were 30-60% higher, emphasizing benthic remineralization processes at AR's organically rich sediment. Marked chemical changes in the ecosystem were observed during the two-year study period, reinforcing the importance of these structures for sandy coastal areas rehabilitation through trophic chain pull-out.

We tested these hypotheses by comparing fish assemblages on two artificial hard substrata, the Ca' Roman and Sottomarina jetties, before (1994 and 2003) and after (2005 and 2006) the deployment of a new breakwater in the area. Our results support the fish production hypothesis. A remarkable increase in richness and abundance of sedentary species was observed on the extant substrata with the presence of the new barrier. More mobile species showed less definite trends. The net result has been a total increase in abundance and richness in the area. While fish assemblage showed important temporal variation in composition before deployment (Ca' Roman, comparison between 1994 and 2003), clear trends of increasing abundance were concurrent with the presence of the new barrier. This increase in abundance, particularly of sedentary species, may be attributed to enhanced connectivity and/or an improvement in larval retention due to the changes in water circulation connected with the new breakwater, or to an increase in juveniles and/or adults promoted by changes in environmental conditions. Indeed, changes in benthic cover were recorded, with an increase of uncovered rock and the appearance of previously unrecorded algae after breakwater deployment. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

A reduction in their patch size or density may affect the productivity, biodiversity and stability of these ecosystems. We determined the effects of different densities and patch sizes of Ecklonia radiata (the dominant kelp in southern Australia) on the secondary productivity, species richness, diversity and community structure of understory epifaunal invertebrates and how associated environmental covariates modified by kelp affected those patterns. We assessed sub-canopy epifauna across 28 artificial reefs with transplanted E. radiata consisting of seven different patch sizes (0.12-7.68 m(2)) crossed with four kelp densities (0-16 kelp m(-2)) over two years. Epifaunal secondary productivity associated with both natural algal and standardised rope fibre habitats decreased with patch size and was elevated when kelp was absent, however, it was also high in natural habitat when there was a high density of kelp. Epifaunal productivity was positively associated with sub-canopy light and water flow but negatively associated with the biomass of the dominant understory alga, Ulva sp. Epifaunal diversity declined with a reduction in reef size as did richness which correlated with a loss of algal species richness. Community structure of epifauna also differed between small and large reefs, between reefs with and without kelp, between rope habitats at the centre and at the edge of reefs, and within natural habitat between reefs supporting high and low densities of kelp. Overall, these results indicate complex effects of E. radiata decline on epifaunal communities, with high secondary productivity associated with dense kelp stands, but also areas without kelp that are dominated by turf algae. While the loss of standing kelp from rocky reefs may result in declines in epifaunal biodiversity, where turf algae replaces kelp, the reefs may still support high secondary productivity.",,,,,,,,,15,0,0,0,12,0,16,,,0030-1299,1600-0706,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Tasmania, Inst Marine & Antarctic Studies, Hobart, Tas 7004, Australia",,,,2020-01-06,WOS:000504046800001,,

Moreover, there have been no park rangers to prevent poaching since 2002.To carry out long-term monitoring of the marine organism mainly fish assemblages established in the artificial reefs, underwater visual censuses (UVC) were carried out in 1987/1989, 1998/2000, and 2008, according to a standardized method. All the fish species present on the artificial reefs were considered to assess density and biomass, but this method is time-consuming (divers formation to UVC techniques).In 2008, in addition to the traditional UVC, a new sampling procedure of the fish assemblages, the FAST method (Fish Assemblage Sampling Technique) was tested. With this method, sampling is based on the presence/absence of a number of given species. This list of species includes only species of interest for commercial and noncommercial fishing.A comparison of the UVC monitoring shows that density of the fish assemblages increased in the first 10 years, then did not increase during the last decade. These results can be explained by a lack of watching within the protected areas to prevent poaching since 2002 and to the reopening to the anthropic activities in 2004. The real efficiency of the artificial reefs to restore or sustain fish assemblages is then discussed.Finally, a comparison of the two census methods (UVC and FAST) has enabled us to put forward a simple, low-cost, and relevant protocol to regularly monitor the fish assemblages of the areas.",,,,,13th French-Japanese Oceanography Symposium13th French-Japanese Oceanography Symposium,20082008,French Acad Sci; Fdn Louis D; Embassy Japan; Maison Culture Japon Paris; Conseil Regional Provence Alpes Cote Azur; Conseil Gen Bouches Rhone; Municipal Marseille; Fac Pharm; Agence Eau Rhone Mediterranee Corse; Fondat Franco Japonaise Sasakawa; Ctr Oceanologie MarseilleFrench Acad Sci; Fdn Louis D; Embassy Japan; Maison Culture Japon Paris; Conseil Regional Provence Alpes Cote Azur; Conseil Gen Bouches Rhone; Municipal Marseille; Fac Pharm; Agence Eau Rhone Mediterranee Corse; Fondat Franco Japonaise Sasakawa; Ctr Oceanologie Marseille,"Marseille, FRANCEMarseille, FRANCE",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,978-90-481-8629-7,,,,,,,,,,,,,2011-01-01,WOS:000329380000010,,

Our objectives were to quickly return transmitter tagged fish to depth (20-30 m) in close proximity (<10 m) to their capture site, and to increase survival by providing predator protection during an initial recovery period.

However, there have been very few studies into the acceptability of these substitute reef environments to divers and the social aspects of diving on artificial reefs. This paper explores the perceptions of diving on artificial reefs through a questionnaire survey of a sample of 337 Australian scuba divers. The awareness of artificial reefs as dive sites among respondents was very high, as were the levels of satisfaction with diving on such sites. Many divers recognised the value of these reefs in reducing diver impacts on natural reefs, and the study shows that artificial reefs do hold considerable attraction to divers.

Knowing what species exist on and around the offshore platforms and what environmental variables influence this species assemblage is crucial for a better understanding of the impact of offshore platforms on marine life. Information on this is limited for offshore platforms in the southern North Sea. This study aims to fill this gap in our knowledge and to determine how the composition and the abundance of species assemblages changes with depth and along a distance-from-shore gradient. The species assemblages on five offshore gas platforms in the southern North Sea have been inventoried using Remotely Operated Vehicles inspection footage. A total of 30 taxa were identified. A Generalised Additive Model of the species richness showed a significant non-linear relation with water depth (p = 0.001): from a low richness in shallow waters it increases with depth until 15-20 m, after which richness decreases again. Using PERMANOVA, water depth (p≤0.001), community age (p≤0.001) and the interaction between distance from shore and community age (p≤0.001) showed a significant effect on the species assemblages. Future research should focus on the effect additional environmental variables have on the species assemblages.

First, like much of the rest of coastal United States, they are experiencing more pronounced coastal hazards, including sea level rise, increased storm rain events, and surging oceanic waters, resulting in flooding. These factors are complicated by climate change. In addition, as the US moves toward clean energy, wind turbines are beginning to be placed in the ocean off their coasts. These two dynamics could result in new relationships between communities and their coasts. This workshop will explore the implications of the changing nature of the human relationship between coastal communities, coastal processes, and electricity infrastructure in the ocean. The workshop will be oriented toward future research and opportunities to adapt, advance preparedness, and absorb and bounce back after storm events. The workshop will be held in Annapolis, Maryland in Spring 2020, and bring together scientists, planners, citizen groups, and business interests. The transition of the US east coast is characterized by two dynamics: coastal hazards, including rising seas, storm surge and increased precipitation events leading to flooding and inundation, which often have more serious impacts in the most vulnerable coastal populations, and siting and installation of renewable energy infrastructure in the ocean. The workshop seeks a better understanding of these interrelated dynamics with a focus on resilience building efforts and consideration of the development of an offshore wind energy system. The workshop will draw on academia (e.g., social and physical scientists, disaster management specialists and Sea Grant engagement professionals); government (federal, tribal, and state and local planners); adaptation practitioners; coastal civil society; and industry/private sector (chamber of commerce, commercial fishers, offshore wind developers) and focus on the changing human relationship with the coast/sea in small coastal communities. The workshop will work to improve understanding of (a) the links between large-scale coastal changes from physical processes and industrialization of the ocean from offshore renewable energy, (b) how best to engage policymakers in viewing these two forces of change together to find common strategies, overcome institutional barriers, and innovative partnering opportunities with co-benefits, and (c) effective risk communication strategies that articulate tradeoffs and uncertainties related to rapid transitions and resilience building in coastal communities. The workshop will generate an interdisciplinary research roadmap that address emerging coastal community transitions and identifies best practices and risk communication strategies to enhance adaptive capacity and resilience.

This population needs food, water and energy. Increasingly, opportunities are sought out at sea to accommodate these needs. As there is already competition for space, especially in the near-shore, opportunities for multi-use, including the combination of, for example, food and energy production in a single location, are sought. One issue that needs to be addressed to allow for multi-use at sea is safety. Existing frameworks for (marine) risk assessment tend to be rather sector specific and, although existing models and frameworks for risk analysis provide useful elements for an integrated analysis, none of the approaches fully caters for the need of having a framework based on a cyclical process of stakeholder input in all steps of the process of risk identification, risk management and risk evaluation and communication, identifying actions to be taken and providing tools useful in each of the steps, while integrating the three perspectives of maritime safety, food (and feed) safety, and environmental impact assessment and the different perspectives of the actors involved. This study developed a common framework for the risk assessment of multi-use at sea, consisting of six steps (Exploring, Understanding, Appraising, Deciding, Implementing and Evaluating & Communication). The framework encompasses and integrates an analysis of food and feed safety aspects, the safety of people and equipment, and environmental safety aspects. For each step, actions are defined, tools that can be of help to stakeholders are presented, and stakeholder participation measures are described. The framework is iterative and dynamic in its nature; with constant communication and evaluation of progress, decisions can be taken to either take a step forward or back. The framework is developed to assist operators and producers, policymakers, and other stakeholders in assessing and managing risks of multi-use at sea.",,,,,,,,,17,0,0,0,0,0,17,,,0964-5691,1873-524X,,,,,,,,,,"Wageningen Marine Res, Wageningen, NetherlandsWageningen Econ Res, Wageningen, NetherlandsWageningen Food Safety Res, Wageningen, NetherlandsWageningen Environm Res, Wageningen, Netherlands",,,,2020-02-25,WOS:000508756500022,,

In this study, sidescan sonar was used to quantify water-column fish abundance and was compared to the established visual observation methods on SCUBA over four reef sites. Calibrated intensity values measured from sidescan sonar echo returns were used to estimate fish body length and to calculate scaled biomass (g/m(2) reef) from a pooled fish length-weight relationship of commonly observed reef fish in the area. Sidescan sonar methods were equivalent to SCUBA surveys for measuring fish abundance over the same reef areas; however, overall reef-associated abundances measured with sidescan were significantly higher because the sidescan could measure a larger water-column area and furthermore allowed for a rapid assessment of abundance on a greater number of reefs in a single sampling day. Scaled abundance and biomass differed significantly between structural types, with the reefed oil-jacket structures in deeper, federally managed waters showing the highest scaled abundance and biomass.

The condition of reefs was examined through SCUBA diving and a side-scan sonar. Much of the reefs in Daeyeonpyeong and Ganghwa area were buried in bottom sediment. Despite an intensive search in Bangnyeong area, even a cluster of reefs was not found and most of them seemed to be buried by sand waves. Thus an appropriate investigation on the sediment transport should be included in pre-assessment for the expected performance and protection of artificial reefs. Distribution of average CPUE in natural fishing ground (control) was estimated by bootstrapping simulation and possible comparison of CPUE between control and reef areas (treatment) were made in Bangnyeong and Socheong (Experiment I). Positive reef effect was detected in Socheong but CPUE of treatment in Bangnyeong was varied between or lower than the 99% CPUE confidence intervals of the control.

We compiled line transect data from 15 shipboard surveys (June 2012-April 2014), along with associated remotely sensed habitat data, in the lower Mid-Atlantic Bight off the coast of Delaware, Maryland, and Virginia, USA. We implemented a recently developed hierarchical community distance sampling model to estimate the seasonal abundance of 40 observed marine bird species. Treating each season separately, we included six oceanographic parameters to estimate seabird abundance: three static (distance to shore, slope, sediment grain size) and three dynamic covariates (sea surface temperature [SST], salinity, primary productivity). We expected that avian bottom-feeders would respond primarily to static covariates that characterize seafloor variability, and that surface-feeders would respond more to dynamic covariates that quantify surface productivity. We compared the variation in species-specific and community-level responses to these habitat features, including for rare species, and we predicted species abundance across the study area. While several protected species used the study area in summer during their breeding season, estimated abundance and observed diversity were highest for nonbreeding species in winter. Distance to shore was the most common significant predictor of abundance, and thus useful in estimating the potential exposure of marine birds to offshore development. In many cases, our expectations based on feeding ecology were confirmed, such as in the first winter season, when bottom-feeders associated significantly with the three static covariates (distance to shore, slope, and sediment grain size), and surface-feeders associated significantly with two dynamic covariates (SST, primary productivity). However, other cases revealed significant relationships between static covariates and surface-feeders (e.g., distance to shore) and between dynamic covariates and bottom-feeders (e.g., primary productivity during that same winter). More generally, we found wide interannual, seasonal, and interspecies variation in habitat relationships with abundance. These results show the importance of quantifying detection and determining the ecological drivers of a community's distribution and abundance, within and among species, for evaluating the potential exposure of marine birds to offshore development.",,,,,,,,,15,0,0,0,15,0,15,,,1051-0761,1939-5582,,,,,,,,,,"North Carolina State Univ, Dept Forestry & Environm Resources, Raleigh, NC 27695 USACUNY Coll Staten Isl, Dept Biol, Staten Isl, NY 10314 USABiodivers Res Inst, Portland, ME 04103 USAUniv Idaho, Dept Fish & Wildlife Sci, Idaho Cooperat Fish & Wildlife Res Unit, Coll Nat Resources, Moscow, ID 83844 USA",Biodivers Res Inst,,,2016-09-01,WOS:000383358000016,27755708,

Cradoscrupocellaria hirsuta, Catenicella paradoxa, and Smittina nitidissima were recorded at several localities of central sectors of the Mediterranean. Only Ca. paradoxa was previously known from the area, while S. nitidissima had previously been recorded only from the Eastern Mediterranean, and Cr. hirsuta is new to the area. Within the examined area, Cr. hirsuta has a wide distribution, occurring on artificial panels and natural substrates. S. nitidissima and Ca. paradoxa were detected only on artificial panels, except for a few Ca. paradoxa colonies from a single locality, which had settled on algae. Artificial substrates offer additional surfaces available for colonisation, often more suitable than natural substrates. As such, they can be rapidly exploited by new settlers and particularly by opportunistic taxa as most alien species are. Although artificial substrates can be advantageous tools for the early detection of non-indigenous species (NISs), submerged anthropogenic substrates, such as artificial reefs and coastal protection structures, may selectively attract non-indigenous species favouring their spreading alongshore.

In the deep ocean, beyond the continental shelf, sponges can form high-density fields, constituting important habitats supporting rich benthic communities. Yet these habitats remain relatively unexplored. The oil and gas industry has played an important role in advancing our knowledge of deep-sea environments. Since its inception in the 1960s, offshore oil and gas industry has moved into deeper waters. However, the impacts of these activities on deep-sea sponges and other ecosystems are only starting to become the subject of active research. Throughout the development, operation and closure of an oil or gas field many activities take place, ranging from the seismic exploration of subseafloor geological features to the installation of infrastructure at the seabed to the drilling process itself. These routine activities and accidental releases of hydrocarbons during spills can significantly impact the local marine environment. Each phase of a field development or an accidental oil spill will therefore have different impacts on sponges at community, individual and cellular levels. Legacy issues regarding the future decommissioning of infrastructure and the abandonment of wells are also important environmental management considerations. This chapter reviews our understanding of impacts from hydrocarbon exploration and exploitation activities on deep-sea sponges and the habitats they form. These impacts include those (1) at community level, decreasing the diversity and density of benthic communities associated with deep-sea sponges owing to physical disturbance of the seabed; (2) at individual level, interrupting filtration owing to exposure to increased sedimentation; and (3) at cellular level, decreasing cellular membrane stability owing to exposure to drill muds. However, many potential effects not yet tested in deep-sea sponges but observed in shallow-water sponges or other model organisms should also be taken into account. Furthermore, to the best of our knowledge, no studies have shown impact of oil or dispersed oil on deep-sea sponges. To highlight these significant knowledge gaps, a summary table of potential and known impacts of hydrocarbon extraction and production activities combined with a simple traffic light scheme is also provided.",,,,,,,,,20,0,0,0,16,0,20,,,0065-2881,,978-0-12-815101-3,,,,,,,,,"Heriot Watt Univ, Sch Energy Geosci Infrastruct & Soc, Edinburgh, Midlothian, ScotlandUniv Edinburgh, Sch GeoSci, Edinburgh, Midlothian, ScotlandNatl Oceanog Ctr, Southampton, Hants, EnglandNat Hist Museum Denmark, Copenhagen, DenmarkInst Adv Sustainabil Studies ES IASS, Potsdam, GermanyPlymouth Univ, Sch Biol & Marine Sci, Plymouth, Devon, EnglandUniv Tennessee, Ctr Environm Biotechnol, Knoxville, TN 37932 USAUniv North Carolina Wilmington, Ctr Marine Sci, Wilmington, NC 28403 USA",Nat Hist Museum DenmarkInst Adv Sustainabil Studies ES IASS,,,2018-12-28,WOS:000452394500002,30012276,

This imbalance may be corrected to varying degrees by enhancing certain natural biological/ecological attributes (ecosystem services), such as the removal of particles by means of filter feeding animals. This topic is addressed by means of a case study - aquaculture in coastal waters. We begin by examining the impacts related to the release of nutrient-rich effluents from a commercial fish farm in the oligotrophic Gulf of Aqaba. This is followed by description of 3 approaches that have been tested as means to capture and remove aquaculture effluents, as an example of how we may enhance the sustainability or reduce the environmental impacts of commercial activities. These approaches include placement of detritus feeding grey-mullets in benthic enclosures on the organically enriched seafloor below commercial fish cages, mooring artificial reefs as benthic biofilters next to fish farms and deployment of pelagic biofilters in the water column, adjacent to fish cages.",,,,,Conference of the NATO-Advanced-Study-Institute on Strategic Management of Marine EcosystemsConference of the NATO-Advanced-Study-Institute on Strategic Management of Marine Ecosystems,"OCT 01-11, 2003OCT 01-11, 2003",NATO Adv Study InstNATO Adv Study Inst,"Nice, FRANCENice, FRANCE",1,0,0,0,1,0,1,,,1568-1238,,1-4020-3157-2,,,,,,,,,"Woods Hole Oceanog Inst, Woods Hole, MA 02543 USA",,,,2005-01-01,WOS:000233133900003,,

Using baited remote underwater video (BRUV) fish assemblages on purpose-built estuarine artificial reefs and adjacent natural rocky-reef and sand-flat were assessed 18 months post-deployment in three south-east Australian estuaries. Fish abundance, species richness and diversity were found to be greater on the artificial reefs than on either naturally occurring reef or sand-flat in all estuaries. Comparisons within each estuary identified significant differences in the species composition between the artificial and natural rocky-reefs. The artificial reef assemblage was dominated by sparid species including Acanthopagrus australis and Rhabdosargus sarba. The preference for a range of habitats by theses sparid species is evident by their detection on sand-flat, natural rocky reef and artificial reef habitats. The fish assemblage identified on the artificial reefs remained distinct from the adjacent rocky-reef, comprising a range of species drawn from naturally occurring rocky-reef and sand-flat. In addition, some mid-water schooling species including Trachurus novaezelandiae and Pseudocaranx georgianus were only identified on the artificial reef community; presumably as result of the reef's isolated location in open-water. We concluded that estuarine artificial reef assemblages are likely to differ significantly from adjacent rocky-reef, potentially as a result of physical factors such as reef isolation, coupled with species specific behavioural traits such as the ability of some species to traverse large sand flats in order to locate reef structure, and feeding preferences. Artificial reefs should not be viewed as direct surrogates for natural reef. The assemblages are likely to remain distinct from naturally occurring habitat comprised of species that reside on a range of adjacent natural habitats.",,,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2015-09-03,DRCI:DATA2015156007181825,,

In the winter, all red snapper showed less movement, and during the warmer months most (63%, 29 out of 46) fish used a secondary reef site. Over diel periods, fish showed significantly greater movements during day hours on 2 reef sites and during night hours on 1 reef site.

Many (53%, n = 9) fish moved short distances (similar to 1.5 km) to nearby reefs, and some red snappers (n = 3) that emigrated returned to their original release site. Red snapper showed some prey-like behaviors, e. g. close association with reef structure, quick movements over open habitat, and paired emigrations to nearby sites.

Reef diving choices and preferences can be calculated through the use of the analytic hierarchy process (AHP). In the AHP, each reef alternative is calculated in terms of a set of decision criteria, as well as the relative importance of each criterion. Decision makers need to know what role artificial reef modules play within the diving choice spectrum in order to decide their potential management interests and AHP results can be used in that decision. In the present pilot case study, the AHP results show that two sub-criteria -the hope of seeing unusual aquatic organisms, and the benefits of updating diving skills- are the most relevant criteria for the diving decision process.

As a consequence, these systems have often been unappreciated and understudied. Important ecosystem services of molluscan-dominated systems include: (1) filtering capacity; (2) benthic-pelagic coupling; (3) creation of refugia from predation; (4) creation of feeding habitat for juvenile and adult mobile species as well as sessile stages of species that attach directly to molluscan shells; and (5) provision of nesting habitat. Destructive harvesting and overfishing can reduce habitat extent and impair habitat functioning. Only recently have ecosystem services been incorporated into the management of these systems. The role of oyster reefs as essential fish habitat falls into two principal categories: (1) reefs as habitat for oysters and (2) reefs as habitat for resident and transient species. Although the former role has received some attention as part of efforts to restore oyster resources, the latter role remains largely unexplored. The role of oyster reefs as critical habitat for other species is suggested by the diverse fauna associated with them; however, the factors that control the development of these reef-associated assemblages are generally unknown, and enumeration of specific habitat services using replicated field experiments is just beginning. Using data summarized from studies in Maryland, Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Texas, we classify finfish assemblages associated with reefs based upon the degree of their association and include an extensive finfish and decapod species list. We conclude, within the context of the current state of knowledge, that (1) the construction of reef bases using materials that provide adequate vertical relief and interstitial space and (2) the establishment of broodstock sanctuaries protected from harvesting pressure are important for restoring oyster populations. Utilization of reef habitats by numerous commercially, recreationally, and ecologically important species across a wide geographic range likely portends the reef habitats' importance as essential fish habitat, but many functional relationships remain to be evaluated. Future oyster habitat research needs include (1) defining the morphological and spatial reef characteristics that support enhanced oyster growth and survival; (2) improving understanding of how harvest methods affect reef integrity and function; (3) determining the critical services provided by reef habitats in the life cycles of important species; and (4) further clarifying the trophic links between the resident fauna on oyster reefs and transient species.",,,,,Sea Grant Symposium on Fish Habitat - Essential Fish Habitat and Rehabilitation at the 1998 Annual Meeting of the American-Fisheries-SocietySea Grant Symposium on Fish Habitat - Essential Fish Habitat and Rehabilitation at the 1998 Annual Meeting of the American-Fisheries-Society,"AUG 26-27, 1998AUG 26-27, 1998",Amer Fisheries SocAmer Fisheries Soc,"HARTFORD, CTHARTFORD, CT",188,3,0,0,163,0,253,,,0892-2284,,1-888569-12-3,,,,,,,,,"Marine Resources Res Inst, S Carolina Dept Nat Resources, Charleston, SC 29422 USA",Marine Resources Res Inst,,,1998-01-01,WOS:000082192300032,,

A stable isotope technique was applied to analyze consumers and their potential carbon sources. Samples were collected from the reef areas built in 2010, 2012, and 2014 and the control area in Dashentang during June 2016. An IsoSource model was used to construct the food web. Stable isotopes were used to calculate the trophic levels of the consumers. The results showed that food sources can be categorized into three categories based on the [delta]13C values of phytoplankton, particulate organic matter, and soil organic matter. Phytoplankton represented the largest source of carbon for consumers (67.2%[approximately]81.5%). The findings from the IsoSource mix model revealed that phytoplankton were the main contributors to the food web in the studied areas. There were no significant differences in the [delta]13C or [delta]15N values of the same food sources from different areas. The [delta]13C values of suspension-feeding bivalves, including Arca subcrenata, Ruditapes philippinarum, and Crassostrea gigas, were significantly higher in the reef areas than in the control area. The proportion of phytoplankton in the carbon sources for suspension-feeding bivalves was significantly higher in the reef areas than in the control area. The [delta]15N values of consumer species ranged from 7.70% to 14.34%, and the trophic levels ranged from 2.0 to 3.95. The [delta]15N values or trophic levels of piscivorous consumers were higher in the reef areas than in the control area, and the level of significance increased with the duration of the reefs.

Uncertainties about the cumulative effects of marine renewable energy developments cause substantial delays during the consenting process, which are exacerbated by the lack of clarity about how to assess cumulative effects. These obstacles have contributed to perceptions that this essential emerging industry receives disproportionate scrutiny relative to established maritime activities. However, alongside legislated targets to reduce carbon emissions, there are legal obligations to protect, maintain and improve the condition of the marine environment. As the imperative to halt the decline in the condition of the environment increases, so expectations of cumulative impact assessments grow and the risk of consenting delays persists. To investigate how robust current cumulative impact assessment practise is, a novel evaluation framework was developed and applied to Environmental Statements of the world's largest offshore wind farms, currently in United Kingdom waters. The framework was designed to evaluate cumulative impact assessments relative to the information needs of decision-makers tasked with managing cumulative effects. We found that current practise does not meet those needs, that there is dissonance between science and practise, and problematic variability between assessments was observed. Straightforward recommendations for improved practise are provided, which if implemented may ease the perceived regulatory burden by clarifying practise. We also highlight additional steps that could enable project-led cumulative impact assessments to better support regional marine management. The results and recommendations will be of interest to countries worldwide where marine renewable energy is emerging alongside ecosystem-approach and marine spatial planning aspirations.",,,,,,,,,42,1,0,0,11,0,45,,,1364-0321,1879-0690,,,,,,,,,,"Cranfield Univ, Sch Water Energy & Environm, Cranfield MK43 0AL, Beds, EnglandCtr Environm Fisheries & Aquaculture Sci Cefas, Pakefield Rd, Lowestoft NR33 OHT, Suffolk, EnglandCape Eleuthera Inst, Queens Highway, Eleuthera, Bahamas",Cape Eleuthera Inst,,,2018-01-30,WOS:000418574800025,,

As an indicator of performance, three fish assemblage parameters (abundance, biomass, species richness) were measured using underwater visual censuses at 11 months post-deployment and 4 months after restoration from hurricane damage. All artificial reef plots showed higher values for fish abundance, biomass and species richness than control plots covered by bare sand, which shows that artificial reefs can locally enhance the fish assemblage. However, the effect differed among artificial reef plots. Fish abundance was 3.8 times higher on the layered cake plots compared to the reef ball plots, while fish biomass was 4.6 times higher. Rock pile plots had intermediate values. Species richness did not differ significantly among different artificial reef plots. Three-dimensional modelling revealed that layered cakes had a smaller gross volume, shelter volume and total surface area than reef balls. The availability of multiple small shelters in the layered cake design appeared to be more relevant than other physical parameters, as the layered cake plots had higher fish abundance than the reef balls plots. We concluded that on Saba and St. Eustatius, layered cake plots performed better than reef ball plots after one year of colonization. Rock pile plots, made of local volcanic rock, showed an intermediate performance, and were 4-10 times cheaper to construct. If observed differences are consistent with other locations and persist during further colonization, current efforts to deploy reef balls could better be allocated to deploy artificial reef structures with a higher shelter density.",,,,,,,,,19,2,0,0,13,1,24,,,0925-8574,1872-6992,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Appl Sci Van Hall Larenstein, Marine Management & Conservat Grp, POB 1528, NL-8901 BV Leeuwarden, NetherlandsWageningen Univ & Res, Marine Anim Ecol Grp, POB 338, NL-6700 AH Wageningen, NetherlandsWageningen Univ & Res, Wageningen Marine Res, POB 57, NL-1780 AB Den Helder, NetherlandsSaba Conservat Fdn, POB 18, Saba, Dutch Caribbean, NetherlandsUniv Haifa, Hatter Dept Marine Technol, Charney Sch Marine Sci, Abba Khoushy Ave 199, IL-3498838 Haifa, Israel",Saba Conservat Fdn,,,2020-10-13,WOS:000573277800002,,

This study tested the effect of the macroalgal cover on temperate reef fishes by mimicking macroalgae on artificial reefs in NW Sicily (Mediterranean Sea). Macroalgal cover affected reef fishes in different ways and independently of intrinsic temporal trends. The fish assemblages of manipulated and control artificial reef units differed in the relative abundances of the associated species, but little in species composition. In line with studies in seagrass habitats, fishes were most abundant in reefs covered by artificial macroalgae. Three species (Boops boops, Serranus scriba and Symphodus ocellatus) exhibited consistently greater abundance on vegetated reef units than on control reef units. The total number of species and the abundance of three particular species (S. scriba, S. ocellatus and Thalassoma pavo) displayed temporal trends which were independent on short and large temporal scales. Only fish total biomass and one species (Spicara flexuoso) displayed strong effects of interaction among the experimental factors. Mechanisms to explain these findings are discussed from observational evidence on habitat use and interactions among multiple species. This study highlights that manipulative experiments involving repeated sampling of fish in artificial habitats appear to be a valid approach to study fish-habitat relationships in fluctuating environments. It is also concluded that macroalgae mimics may serve as a tool for restoring lost marine vegetated habitats when current human-induced conditions prevent the recovery of pristine macroalgal stands.

The ichthyoplankton and juvenile fish assemblages were sampled at Green Canyon 18 (219-m depth, shelf slope), Grand Isle 94 (60-m depth, mid-shelf), and South Timbalier 54 (22-m depth, inner shelf) with passive plankton nets and light traps. At all sites, clupeiforms were the dominant taxa collected, comprising 59-97% of the total catch. Reef-dependent Fishes (e.g., pomacentrids and scarids) were relatively rare at all Platforms, while reef-associated taxa (e.g., serranids, carangids, and blenniids) were generally more common. High numbers of piscivorous juveniles (synodontids, scombrids, and carangids) were collected, indicating that predation during early life history stages may be important in determining local reef assemblages. Similarity indices indicated that the larval and juvenile fish assemblages collected at the platforms differed across the shelf. Overall, across-shelf patterns in reef fish larval and juvenile fish distributions were similar to those of the adults. Taxonomic richness (genus level) was highest at the mid-shelf platform, possibly a result of its proximity to a high density of upstream and surrounding platforms, which may create generally favorable conditions for the recruitment of reef fishes. There were no significant differences in taxonomic diversity among the platforms in plankton net collections, but light trap diversity was significantly highest at the mid-shelf platform. With the limited amount of hard-substrate habitat available in the northern Gulf, the addition of artificial habitats (platforms) may increase the chances of adult fishes finding suitable spawning habitat, as well as increase the number of settlement sites for juvenile fishes, particularly where platforms are most dense (mid- and inner shelf).",,,,,Gulf of Mexico Fish and Fisheries MeetingGulf of Mexico Fish and Fisheries Meeting,"OCT 24-26, 2000OCT 24-26, 2000",Minerals Management ServMinerals Management Serv,"NEW ORLEANS, LANEW ORLEANS, LA",22,0,0,0,20,1,29,,,0892-2284,,1-888569-54-9,,,,,,,,,"NOAA, Beaufort Lab, Beaufort, NC 28516 USA",,,,2003-01-01,WOS:000185466300003,,

As wild fisheries reduce in size or stabilise there is growing interest in enhancement as a means of restoring or increasing production. The purpose of this paper is to document marine enhancement initiatives in New Zealand and to describe species, or groups of species, of potential enhancement interest over the next 10 years. An overview of any potentially negative impacts of such enhancemenis is given. The rise in interest in fisheries enhancement in New Zealand in recent years, which is likely to further increase in coming years, flows from the successful Nelson scallop enhancement programme, encouraging results from other initiatives, and the growing momentum of marine enhancement internationally. However, there is also an increasing awareness that stocking alone is seldom enough, and that successful enhancement often requires restoration of key components of the marine environment itself. The species Rely to be of most interest for enhancement in New Zealand over the next 10 years are scallops, dredge oysters, estuarine shellfish including cockles and pipi, toheroa, paua, rock lobster, certain seaweeds, snapper, and salmon. There will probably also be interest in the wider use of artificial reefs for ecosystem development. Such initiatives could potentially take place the length and breadth of the country, to the benefit (or cost) of all users, commercial, recreational, and customary.

Artificial reef (AR) is a kind of artificial fish habitat which provides living, hiding and breeding places for aquatic organisms and thereby augmenting the biodiversity and abundance of fishery resources. In particular, the installation of ARs along coastal regions could bring down the fishing pressure from mechanized sectors and thus support the small scale traditional fisheries. Since the management based on AR is not species specific but effective for all aquatic organisms in the ecosystem, it allows fishery managers to move from a single species framework to ecosystem based fisheries management in the long run. Being a tropical coastal nation, India has also initiated trials on AR deployment. However, these studies so far are limited to the design, construction and performance of AR.

To provide insight into the factors explaining invasion success, we examined the distribution and abundance of native lionfish in 2 regions of the Western Pacific (Marianas and Philippines). Densities of lionfish and other predatory coral reef fishes were evaluated via stratified surveys targeting habitat preferred by lionfish. There were considerable regional differences in species composition of lionfishes in general and density of Pterois volitans in particular. Red lionfish were uncommon on Guam (3.5 fish ha(-1)) but 6 times more abundant in the Philippines (21.9 fish ha(-1)). Densities in both regions were an order of magnitude less than reported in the invaded Atlantic. There was no relationship between density of lionfish and that of other reef predators, including groupers. Both native populations of P. volitans were more common on reef-associated habitats (sandy slopes, reef channels, and artificial reefs) than on coral reefs. On Guam, P. volitans was more abundant in areas of low water visibility (reef channels and river mouths) compared to reefs with high water clarity. Lionfish in their native range are habitat generalists that occupy various environments, including areas with low salinity and high sediment loads.

Migration counts from points strategically located on the coast can be a reliable and effective method of reaching this goal. We propose a consistent and statistically robust method for estimating such numbers by generalized additive modeling of the numbers passing during periods when counts are interrupted. This procedure has the advantage of accounting for the effects of covariates, such as wind, on the counts in a flexible manner, potentially increasing accuracy and precision. We develop a reliable method of estimating precision, based on a parametric bootstrap, and applied a sensitivity analysis to our models to test their accuracy. We demonstrate the method with three species of seabirds migrating through the Strait of Gibraltar. Estimated numbers of the Northern Gannet (Morus bassanus) are similar to the estimated Atlantic population that winters in the western Mediterranean Sea, while for both Cory's (Calonectris diomedea) and Balearic (Puffinus mauretanicus) Shearwaters they are greater than the current population estimates. These results have important implications in conservation and highlight the necessity for reestimation of the latter two species' global population.

This can cause future problems as decommissioning needs to be planned at the beginning to prevent complications that may arise, as it implies important operations and high costs. There are numerous features that make decommissioning a challenge, such as the marine environment, the technical limitations of vessels and the lack of specific regulations that determine what should be done, increasing the uncertainty of the process. Additionally, the unique characteristics of the sites involve exclusive optimal solutions for each project. This article analyses the main operation parameters that affect the decommissioning process, identifying the benefits and drawbacks of the influencing variables. A model is designed to compare different transportation strategies, searching for cost reduction. A decommissioning methodology is been proposed based on this analysis, taking into consideration the technical aspects of the process, and minimising environmental impacts. The model forecasts that the predicted duration and costs of this process are not being adequately captured in site decommissioning plans. (C) 2016 The Authors.

In the current study, we investigated changes in the taxonomic diversity and ecological exergy (eco-exergy) of the macrobenthic faunal community for 2 years following AR construction in Daya Bay, China. The results indicated that macrobenthic faunal diversity, species richness, and evenness increased but abundance, biomass, eco-exergy, and specific eco-exergy decreased following AR construction; after declining, however, abundance, biomass, and eco-exergy appeared to be increasing at the end of the 2-year sampling period. In terms of biomass and eco-exergy, mollusks were the dominant group at each sampling period and were mainly responsible for the changes in biomass and ecoexergy. Eco-exergy was positively correlated with macrobenthic abundance and was negatively related with evenness.

Only 48.9% of the articles in the literature review included a theoretical underpinning, or discussed an existing framework. Of these, 42.2% were theories or frameworks that were only featured in a single paper, highlighting the need for theoretical focus within this field of study. For those theories and frameworks that had been explored in multiple articles, these theories and frameworks were grouped into nine overarching concepts: acceptance, place attachment, justice, economics, technology innovation systems, environmental assessment, strategic environmental assessment, adaptive management, and marine spatial planning (MSP). Each of these concepts were expounded on to discuss the limitations of the current research on the concept and identify promising avenues for future research. In comparing the functionality of these concepts, most have a realized capacity for understanding costs and benefits, risk and uncertainty. However less than half have a realized capacity for managing costs and benefits and risk, while less than a third have a realized capacity for managing uncertainty.

An unmanned solution eliminates the need for a secondary manned vessel to provide emergency response onsite, reducing the number of technicians required to work offshore which reduces the overall risk profile and the risk of COVID-19 transmission between personnel.Change 2: Enable offshore wind farm layout optimisation to improve the profitability of offshore wind farms. A resident marine-based search and rescue service removes the constraint of helicopter search and rescue which requires sites to be built in grid patterns.Change 3: Enable helicopter only operations for rapid repair/breakdown response. Current guidance requires a secondary means of rescue within 30 minutes of a helicopter in the event of an emergency. Safety Net would cover this requirement enabling helicopters to deploy without backup vessels.OBJECTIVES/ FOCUSThis project will bring the partners together required to develop a turn key search and rescue service. The partners will be integrating several state-of-the-art technologies with high TRL values and applying these in a novel manner.Working with our technology partners the key objectives are:* Create a machine learning / Artificial Intelligence (AI) solution to save lives. Employing input from both aerial and onboard multispectral sensors the solution will:- Autonomously navigate all deployed assets to the casualties, identified by location beacon or VHF DR.* Identify the signature of one or more casualties in the water.* autonomously manoeuvre assets, according to prevailing conditions, Collision Regulations and casualty location to a position where the casualty can be recovered* Employ the novel Casualty Conveyor Rescue System to recover conscious or unconscious casualties from the water to a place of shelter where their needs can be remotely assessed.* Employing a data solution, to communicate sensory and multispectral data from both aerial and surface assets to a Remote Operations Centre. The solution must provide primary low latency, high capacity bandwidth from a moving asset in multiple degrees of freedom* Employing 5G and fiber optic networks to provide secondary resilient communication via mobile assets and the Launch and Recovery System (LARS) base stations.By developing, testing and integrating these technologies we aim to offer the worlds first offshore autonomous marine based search and rescue service, helping to save lives at sea and build the wind farms of the future.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,77451,,,,,,,,Offshore Survival Systems Limited,Offshore Survival Systems Limited,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:15366083,,

The model was consisted of 19 functional groups, basically covering the main processes of the energy flow in the Lidao artificial reef ecosystem. The functional groups were divided according to the relationships of the corresponding positions between appeared fishes and artificial reefs, and the planktonic heterotrophic bacteria were included into the model as a functional group. The fishes appeared in the investigation zone were divided into seven functional groups, and the trophic levels of the functional groups varied from 1.00 to 3.72. The type I fishes had the highest trophic level. The total system throughput was estimated to be 10786.68 t . km(-2) . a(-1), 27% of which flowed to detritus, and 17% flowed out the ecosystem in the forms of fishing and sediment. The total net primary productivity of the system was 4131.97 t . km(-2) . a(-1), and the total energy transfer efficiency was 10.5%. The proportion of the total flow originated from detritus was 39%, and that from primary producers was 61 go, indicating that the energy flow was dominated by food web rather than detritus. The ratio of total primary productivity to total respiration of the system was 1.84, the connectivity index was 0.20, and the Finn's cycling index and the mean path length of the energy flow were 4.5% and 2.62, respectively. This study showed that the Lidao artificial reef ecosystem had a relatively low maturity and sta-bility, was at a developing stage, and had weak resistance against outside interference. The ecological environment and the output of fisheries in the artificial reef zone would have inter-annual fluctuations, and thus, the eco-environment restoration of the artificial reef ecosystem could only be realized by the sustainable maintaining of the ecosystem.",,,,,,,,,10,27,0,0,8,0,35,,,1001-9332,,,,,,,,,,,"Ocean Univ China, Coll Fisheries, Qingdao 266003, Shandong, Peoples R China",,,,2013-01-04,BCI:BCI201300095565,23359953,

This has led to a significant growth in installed wind power capacity within the last decade (especially in offshore wind power in the UK) to 18.9 GW in the UK and 539 GW globally. The UK market has multiplied 10-fold, supplying 5.4% of the UK's electricity consumption in 2016\.Turbine blades are subjected to gusting wind loads, driving the accumulation of fatigue damage in the blade structures, leading to failures. Around 3,800 blade failures a year are attributed to poor maintenance. Preventative inspection every 3-4 months and maintenance every 6 months is necessary, costing between £70,000 and £700,000 each. Accidents and fatalities are also quite prevalent: 2,265 accidents to June 2018, with fatalities accounting for 6% and injuries 7%.This phase 2 further develops RADBLAD, a first-of-its-kind magnetically-adhering wall-climbing robot, with manipulator arm that deploys the x-ray system around a blade. An end effector holds the source and detector against the blade, so they move with the blade in the presence of 3-D blade vibrations. A crucial and novel extension of RADBLAD lies in the use of a radiographic system for inspection and in providing an integrated solution that offers high-quality, efficient inspection method, which is human safe. Unlike radiography, RADBLAD does not require costly, time-consuming onshore dismantling of blades and transportation to workshop, inspection in x-ray bays and return and reassembly, taking around 10-days during which revenue is lost due to generating downtime. Contact methods, e.g. ultrasound volume inspection, are less effective on multi-layered composite structures, and more difficult to perform on-site. RADBLAD is also faster and cheaper than onshore inspection (not counting loss of revenue due to turbine downtime).To successfully achieve this, the project consortium features the relevant expertise, including robotic development and manufacture, radiography development, and AI algorithm software development.Our initial target market is the offshore wind turbine operation and maintenance market, with wind farm asset operators the target users.

Because of the unstable nature of sediments, they require a detailed and systematic investigation that acoustic systems can provide. An AR into the marine environment acts as an open system with exchange of material and energy, altering the physical and biological characteristics of the surrounding area. The AR stability will depend on the balance of scour, settlement, and burial resulting from ocean conditions over time. The acoustic systems are efficient tools in monitoring the environmental evolution around ARs, whereas water turbidity can limit visual dive and ROV inspections. High-frequency multibeam echosounder offers the potential of detecting fine-scale distribution of reef units, providing an unprecedented level of resolution, coverage, and spatial definition. In 2008 the EM3002 multibeam was used to investigate the first scientifically-planned AR in Italy deployed during 1974-75. After 33 years the AR is almost in perfect condition. A considerable scouring around the structures and some vertical/horizontal movements of the single units have occurred. Moreover a deepening of the whole area hosting the AR was observed.",,,,,9th International Conference on Artificial Reefs and Related Aquatic Habitats (CARAH)9th International Conference on Artificial Reefs and Related Aquatic Habitats (CARAH),"NOV 08-13, 2009NOV 08-13, 2009",,"Curitiba, BRAZILCuritiba, BRAZIL",8,0,0,0,0,0,10,,,1679-8759,1982-436X,,,,,,,,,,"CNR, Ist Sci Marine, I-60125 Ancona, ItalyUniv S Florida, Coll Marine Sci, St Petersburg, FL 33701 USA",,,,2011-10-26,WOS:000295722300016,,

Water-column effects were generally limited to the period of the ongoing oil releases, although, due to an extensive oil sedimentation event (dirty blizzard), effects on the benthos have the potential to be chronic, especially in soft sediments. Impacts on phytoplankton, zooplankton, and ichthyoplankton were relatively short-lived, and the abundance and species composition of planktonic communities returned to pre-spill conditions within a year of the event. Mortalities of larval fish were generally less than 20% of Gulf-wide species populations owing to the extensive and extended spawning periods of most species. Impacts on the productivity of the region's fisheries were also relatively short-lived and influenced by extensive fishery closures to protect seafood safety, although long-term effects may eventually alter the productivity of some stocks.Benthic communities exhibited effects from the spill that ranged from negligible to significant. Hard-bottom communities, including natural and artificial reefs, suffered injuries that were severe and long lasting. Due to the patchy nature of oil deposition, high tolerance of toxins, and low bioavailability, effects on soft-sediment communities appear to be minimal except in areas, such as beaches, where oil settled in very high amounts. However, DWH oil may persist in coastal and continental shelf sediments for decades if it is sequestered by continuing sedimentation in the absence of events such as tropical storms that may resuspend contaminated bottom material. Nevertheless, vertebrates and shellfish foraging or living in the sediments may be continuously exposed to weathered DWH oil. Understanding the full impacts of the spill requires sustained monitoring in order to separate event-induced impacts from normal variability, and it also requires research that spans the natural range of variation in benthic and pelagic communities. Collection of routine contaminant baselines in GoM waters, sediments, and biota should be viewed as a high priority moving forward.",,,,,,,,,40,0,0,0,31,0,48,,,1042-8275,,,,,,,,,,,"Univ S Florida, Coll Marine Sci, Biol Oceanog, St Petersburg, FL 33701 USALouisiana State Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Baton Rouge, LA 70803 USAUniv S Alabama, Dauphin Isl, AL USADauphin Isl Sea Lab, Dauphin Isl, AL USAUniv S Florida, Coll Marine Sci, St Petersburg, FL 33701 USA",,,,2016-09-01,WOS:000382334500022,,

Particularly, macro-invertebrate and fish assemblages can benefit directly from reefs providing structurally complex habitats and indirectly through alteration of soft-sediment environment near the reef areas. To test this hypothesis, a manipulative field experiment was carried out on an eroding intertidal flat in the southeastern coast of Bangladesh by deploying replicate units of each 20 m long oyster breakwater reefs specially designed to protect adjacent shorelines. Transient fishes and resident intertidal macro-invertebrate communities were assessed monthly for a period of 18 months. On the intertidal flat, five transects were setup for faunal and environmental data collection, three crossing the breakwater reefs and two along the control areas without reefs. Prior to the deployment of the reefs, both the macro-invertebrate and fish assemblage were not significantly different among the five transects, indicating a rather uniform distribution of species in all tidal flats. Data collected post-reef deployment revealed that oyster breakwater reefs supported a greater biomass as well as abundance of benthic macro-invertebrates on the landward mudflat behind the reefs than the mudflat of control sites. The community structure, and seasonal variation of the macrobenthic community were associated with the variations in the sediment accumulation, as influenced by the breakwater reefs. Additionally, higher abundance of transient finfish and mobile macro-invertebrates at the reef sites suggest that the faunal communities were attracted by the higher abundance of prey resources (i.e. polychaetes, small crustaceans, juvenile gastropods and bivalves) as supported by the reefs. Thus, the reef areas served as shelter, nursery, and foraging grounds for different species. Though the ecological benefits of using oyster breakwater reefs only span adjacent to the reefs, this study confirms the importance of reef structure in facilitating local coastal biodiversity in a subtropical region.",,,,,,,,,9,0,0,0,7,0,9,,,0925-8574,1872-6992,,,,,,,,,,"Wageningen Univ & Res, Wageningen Marine Res, POB 77, NL-4400 AB Yerseke, NetherlandsWageningen Univ & Res, Aquaculture & Fisheries Grp, POB 338, NL-6700 AH Wageningen, NetherlandsUniv Chittagong, Inst Marine Sci, Chittagong 4331, BangladeshNIOZ Yerseke, Royal Netherlands Inst Sea Res, Dept Estuarine & Delta Syst, POB 140, NL-4400 AC Yerseke, Netherlands",,,,2019-12-02,WOS:000497646800009,,

Generally, fish living on artificial reefs fared as well or better than those on natural reefs, with some exceptions. Semicossyphus pulcher fared better on artificial reefs, having higher foraging success, fecundity, densities, and tissue production. Embiotoca jacksoni grew faster on natural reefs, and P. nebulifer was in slightly better condition on natural reefs. Total fish tissue production tended to be higher on artificial reefs than on natural reefs, though this pattern was not evident on all reef pairs. Tissue production was positively correlated with the abundance of large boulders, which was higher on artificial reefs than natural reefs. The similar or greater production of fish tissue per cubic metre on artificial reefs relative to natural reefs indicates that these artificial habitats are valuable in producing fish biomass.

Seasonal effects on Barred Sand Bass abundance were observed on UVC but not on BRUV. BRUVs detected Barred Sand Bass more frequently than UVC surveys (83% vs 46%, respectively), and a power analysis estimated that BRUVs required substantially fewer samples than UVC to detect a 100% change in the relative abundance of Barred Sand Bass over time (19 vs 52 samples, respectively). However, Barred Sand Bass exhibited territorial behavior around the bait and BRUV data were quite conservative, suggesting that UVC will perform better at generating estimates of total abundance.

The artificial reefs comprised five shelter treatments: 24 large holes, 12 large holes, 24 small holes, 12 small holes, and holeless controls. Although small individuals (<15 cm TL) of the two most abundant species, E. striatus and E. afer, were distributed evenly among these treatments, larger individuals were usually more abundant on large-hole reefs. E. striatus and E. afer partitioned the artificial reefs by depth, ranging from 6 to 12 m, with E. striatus occurring deeper than E. afer. Tagged individuals demonstrated persistence on and homing to specific reefs. Overall, Nassau grouper was the most abundant of six species of Epinephelus observed on the artificial reefs. However, this was not the case on natural reefs or in commercial catches, which were dominated by E. cruentatus, E. fulvus, and E. guttatus. Growth rates of a distinct recruit cohort of Nassau grouper on the artificial reefs were comparable to those estimated in other recent field studies. Mean monthly growth rates ranged from 0.84 to 1.17 cm.month(-1), and mean growth from the first month of observation (mean size = 8.7 cm) through the eleventh month (19.5 cm) was 10.8 cm. Persistence of the cohort during the year was low, with an 85.4% decline from 158 to 23 individuals over 8 months, presumably due to predation. Due to apparent recruitment overfishing caused by decimation of the local spawning aggregation off St. Thomas, Nassau grouper catches have declined dramatically in recent years. Given the differential distribution of adult Nassau grouper between artificial and natural reefs, we conclude that artificial reefs of the appropriate design may enhance the local abundance of this commercially valuable species.",,,,,,,,,59,2,0,0,39,2,71,,,0007-4977,1553-6955,,,,,,,,,,"OREGON STATE UNIV, DEPT ZOOL, CORVALLIS, OR 97331 USAOREGON STATE UNIV, COLL OCEAN & ATMOSPHER SCI, CORVALLIS, OR 97331 USA",,,,1994-09-01,WOS:A1994QB58400019,,

This work has been undertaken on behalf of The Offshore Wind Strategic Monitoring Research Forum (OWSMRF) (https://jncc.gov.uk/our-work/owsmrf/) MRF is an industry-led collaborative forum that aims to identify and develop research to fill critical knowledge gaps in our understanding of the impact of offshore wind development on the marine environment. OWSMRF stakeholders identified cumulative impacts on kittiwakes as the priority need for improving understanding of offshore windfarm environmental impacts. Improving understanding of connectivity between OWF and SPA populations was identified as one of the key knowledge gaps in this area (the other two being: reducing uncertainty around estimates of collision mortality and developing a tool to facilitate cumulative effects assessment). JNCC organised an expert workshop to help understand what research might help to reduce uncertainty in this connectivity. This report provides a summary of existing, relevant, research and evidence, and research opportunities that were discussed during the workshop. The research opportunities (ROs) suggested as potentially very useful and discussed during the workshop are: RO2.1: extending a draft apportioning tool that has been developed for Scottish waters (by CEH and RSPB, on behalf of Marine Scotland) into UK waters. This tool uses species distribution predictions based on GPS tracking data presented in Wakefield et al. (2017) to provide quantitative apportioning of birds seen within a windfarm footprint to source colonies (for four species including kittiwake). This project would use the code developed for the existing (Scottish waters) tool and the UK-wide work of Wakefield et al. (2017) to extend the tool across UK waters. RO2.2: macro-analysis of existing data to identify spatial and temporal patterns in migration movements. This project uses a collation of currently available data and products from various sources (both at-sea and tracking data types, and distribution map products). These data would be analysed to assess broad latitudinal movements and timings of migration, to indicate the extent at which cumulatively, kittiwakes are interacting with multiple windfarm zones and footprints during different seasons. RO2.3: strategic (non-GPS) tracking feasibility study. This project would explore the feasibility of, and practicalities around, using smaller lighter and less expensive means of tracking than GPS devices. This would include consideration of VHF radio tracking, Passive Integrated Transponder (PIT) devices and/or colour ringing. If deployed at scale across the UK, this would provide information on linkages between multiple wind farms and colonies (in similar way to existing GPS tagging studies, but over a longer time period, covering many more individuals, at much larger spatial scale, and including the non-breeding season) and on linkages between colonies over time (e.g. do kittiwakes move from one colony to another across years). This RO would also provide synergies with improved understanding of windfarm-induced mortality, and demographic rates for estimating population impacts of windfarm effects. RO2.4: catching kittiwakes at sea; proof of concept and guidance. This project is a combination of desk-based and at-sea studies which would explore approaches and methods for catching kittiwakes at sea, sampling/device attachment/data collection options, potential biases and other issues to be aware of. It would combine a literature review and contacting seabird catching experts to learn lessons, and a trial of catching kittiwakes at sea to test lessons and assumptions, and production of guidance for catching of kittiwakes at sea for data collection/device attachment purposes. This would facilitate a more windfarm focussed approach to collection of movement/linkage data, leading to efficiencies and reduced uncertainty in linking windfarm effects to relevant populations. RO2.5: citizen science to provide age structure information of kittiwakes, both along the coast and at sea. This RO would use citizen science to improve evidence for assessing what proportion of birds seen at a windfarm footprint (and/or potentially affected by a windfarm) are adults. This would allow potential windfarm effects to not only be apportioned to the appropriate population (e.g. colony) but also to the appropriate age-class within each population. Several of these research opportunities would complement each other, and combined, could lead to real change in the way windfarm effects are apportioned to colonies and populations, and significantly reduce uncertainty in assessments of cumulative impacts on kittiwake from offshore windfarm deployment.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,0963-8091,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2021-11-21,ZOOREC:ZOOR15712083124,,

In giant kelp forests, shade from the canopy of the giant kelp, Macrocystis pyrifera, negatively affects understory algae, which compete with sessile invertebrates for space. This raises the possibility that giant kelp indirectly facilitates sessile invertebrates, via suppression of understory algae. We evaluated the effect of giant kelp on the relative abundance of algae and invertebrates by experimentally manipulating kelp abundance on large artificial reefs located off San Clemente, California, USA. The experiments revealed a negative effect of giant kelp on both light availability and understory algal abundance and a positive effect on the abundance of sessile invertebrates, which was consistent with an indirect effect mediated by shade from the kelp canopy. The importance of these processes to temporal variability in benthic community structure was evaluated at 16 locations on natural reefs off Santa Barbara, California, over an eight-year period. Interannual variability in the abundance of understory algae and in the abundance of sessile invertebrates was significantly and positively related to interannual variability in the abundance of giant kelp. Analysis of these observational data using Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) indicated that the magnitude of the indirect effect of giant kelp on invertebrates was six times larger than the direct effect on invertebrates. Results suggest that the dynamics of this system are driven by variability in the abundance of a single structure-forming species that has indirect positive, as well as direct negative, effects on associated species.",,,,,,,,,99,2,0,0,90,0,117,,,0012-9658,1939-9170,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Dept Ecol Evolut & Marine Biol, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USAUniv Calif Santa Barbara, Inst Marine Sci, Santa Barbara, CA 93111 USA",,,,2009-11-01,WOS:000271457300016,19967868,

Three-dimensional, intertidal reefs were constructed near Fisherman's Island, Virginia: two reefs in 1995 using surfclam (Spisula solidissima) shell and six reefs in 1996 using surfclam shell, oyster shell, and stabilized coal ash. We have monitored oyster recruitment and growth quarterly at three tidal heights (intertidal, mean low water, and subtidal) on each reef type since their construction Oyster recruitment in 1995 exceeded that observed in the two subsequent years. High initial densities on the 1995 reefs decreased and stabilized at a mean of 418 oyster/m(2). Oyster settlement occurred on all reef types and tidal heights in 1996; however, postsettlement mortality on the surfclam shell and coal ash reefs exceeded that on the oyster shell reefs, which remained relatively constant throughout the year (mean = 935 oysters/m(2)). Field observations suggest that predation accounts for most of the observed mortality and that the clam shell and coal ash reefs, which have little interstitial space, suffer greater predation. Oyster abundance was consistently greatest higher in the intertidal zone on all reefs in each year studied. The patterns observed here lead to the preliminary conclusion that the provision of spatial refugia (both intertidal and interstitial) from predation is an essential feature of successful oyster reef restoration in this region. In addition, high levels of recruitment can provide a numerical refuge, whereby the oysters themselves will provide structure and increase the probability of an oyster population establishing successfully on the reef.",,,,,International Conference on Shellfish RestorationInternational Conference on Shellfish Restoration,"NOV 18-21, 1998NOV 18-21, 1998",,"HILTON HEAD ISL, SOUTH CAROLINAHILTON HEAD ISL, SOUTH CAROLINA",50,1,0,0,41,0,61,,,0730-8000,,,,,,,,,,,"Coll William & Mary, Virginia Inst Marine Sci, Eastern Shore Lab, Wachapreague, VA 23480 USAColl William & Mary, Virginia Inst Marine Sci, Gloucester Point, VA 23062 USA",,,,2000-06-01,WOS:000088636000059,,

In the process of the large scaled construction of submerged concrete structures, of course environmental hazardous substance, such as alkaline(pH) and heavy metals, may be leached. Thus, this issue needs to be adequately reviewed and studied. Therefore, this study attempted to develop a CSA(Calcium Sulfo Aluminate) activator using electric arc furnace reducing slags, as well as the eco-friendly concrete for artificial reefs using electric arc furnace oxidizing slag as aggregate for concrete. The strength properties of the eco-friendly concrete exposed to the marine environment were lower than those of the normal concrete by curing 28 days. This suggest that additional studies are needed to improve the early strength of the eco-friendly concrete. With respect to seawater resistance of the eco-friendly concrete, the average strength loss against 1 year of curing days reached 8-9%. the eco-friendly concrete using high volume of ground granulated blast furnace slags and high specific gravity of electronic arc furnace oxidizing slag demonstrated the sufficient usability as a freeze-thaw resistant material. With respect to heavy metal leaching properties of the eco-friendly concrete, heavy metal substances were immobilized by chemical bonding in the curing process through the hydration of concrete. Thus, heavy metal substances were neither identified at or below environmental hazard criteria nor detected, suggesting that the eco-friendly concrete is safe in terms of leaching of hazardous substances.",,,,"해양환경에 노출된 콘크리트는 육상에서 건설되는 콘크리트와 달리 해풍, 조력, 파도, 파랑 등에 의한 물리적 작용과 해수의 SO42-, Cl- 및 Mg2+ 이온 등에 의한 화학적 침식작용 및 동결융해 등 가혹한 환경에 노출되어 콘크리트의 내구성을 크게 저하시킨다. 해중 콘크리트의 대규모 시공은 콘크리트의 강도손실은 물론 알칼리(pH) 및 중금속 등 환경유해물질이 용출될 수 있어 이에 대한 충분한 검토와 연구가 필요한 실정이다. 본 연구에서는 전기로 환원슬래그로부터 CSA 자극제를 개발하고 전기로 산화슬래그를 콘크리트용 골재로 활용하여 인공리프용 친환경콘크리트를 개발하였다. 초기강도는 Normal concrete보다 낮게 나타나 친환경콘크리트의 초기강도 품질향상을 위한 추가적인 연구가 필요하였으며, 친환경콘크리트의 해수저항성은 양생일 1년 대비 평균 강도손실이 8∼9% 발생하였다. 고함량 고로슬래그 미분말과 고비중 전기로 산화슬래그 골재를 사용한 친환경콘크리트를 동결융해저항성 재료로써 충분히 활용할 수 있는 가능성을 확인하였다. 친환경콘크리트의 중금속 용출특성은 콘크리트의 수화반응을 통한 경화과정에서 중금속 성분은 화학적 결합을 통해 고정화되기 때문에 환경유해성 기준 이하이거나 검출되지 않아 유해물질 용출에 안전하다는 것을 확인하였다.",,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,,,1015-6348,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2015-01-01,KJD:ART001994802,,

Comparisons of mtDNA sequences of the SwGoMx population with those from conspecifics from 16 sites scattered across its native geographic range show that the SwGoMx population is derived from two of four native lineages: one from the north-west Pacific Ocean, the other from the northern Indian Ocean. Three hypotheses address how this species was introduced to the SwGoMX: (1) aquarium release; (2) borne by cargo-ship; and (3) carried by offshore petroleum platform (petro-platform). The first is unlikely because this species rarely features in the aquarium trade, and N. cyanomos'' traded to the USA from the sole IWP source we are aware of are a misidentified congener, N. taeniurus. The second hypothesis is unlikely because shipping has not been associated with the introduction of alien damselfishes, there is little international shipping between the IWP and the SwGoMx, and voyages between those areas would be lengthy and along environmentally unfavorable routes. Various lines of evidence support the third hypothesis: (i) bio-fouled petro-platforms represent artificial reefs that can sustain large and diverse populations of tropical reef-fishes, including N. cyanomos in the SwGoMx; (ii) relocation of such platforms has been implicated in trans-oceanic introductions leading to establishment of non-native populations of such fishes; and (iii) genetic characteristics of the SwGoMx population indicate that it was established by a large and diverse group of founders drawn from the IWP regions where many petro-platforms currently in the SwGoMx and other Atlantic offshore oilfields originated.",,,,,,,,,13,0,0,0,11,0,13,,,2167-8359,,,,,,,,,,,"Smithsonian Trop Res Inst, Naos Marine Lab, Balboa, PanamaUniv Michoacana, Fac Biol, Lab Biol Acuat, Morelia, Michoacan, MexicoUniv Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Escuela Nacl Estudios Super, Lab Nacl Anal & Sintesis Ecol Conservac Recursos, Unidad Morelia, Morelia, Michoacan, MexicoNova Southeastern Univ, Guy Harvey Res Inst, Ft Lauderdale, FL 33314 USAUNAM, Fac Ciencias, Unidad Multidisciplinaria Docencia & Invest Sisal, Sisal, Yucatan, MexicoUniv Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Lab Nacl Resiliencia Costera, Unidad Acad Yucatan, Sisal, Yucatan, MexicoTexas A&M Univ Corpus Christi, Harte Inst Gulf Mexico Studies, Corpus Christi, TX USA",,,,2018-02-19,WOS:000424497900004,29441235,

In recognition of their potential ecological and economic importance, there is increasing interest in understanding how design features can influence community development. We investigated the influence of wave exposure on breakwater coral communities in Dubai, United Arab Emirates. Coral community composition, cover, size structure, recruitment, mortality, and growth rates were compared quarterly between two windward and two leeward breakwater sites for 1 yr to explore the influence of wave exposure on coral community development. Comparisons also were made with a natural coral reef to gain an understanding of how community structure and dynamics compare between these habitats. Benthic and water column sediment particle sizes were also analyzed. Leeward breakwaters contained a low-cover coral community dominated by small colonies with high mortality compared with windward breakwaters and the natural reef. Windward breakwater coral communities had comparable recruitment, mortality, and growth rates as the natural reef. Fine sediments (< 63 pm) dominated the benthos and water column on leeward breakwaters, while windward breakwaters and the natural reef were dominated by sediments with larger size classes (> 125 pm), likely as a result of differences in wave action among reef types. Overall, these results suggest that leeward breakwaters represent sub-optimal habitats for coral community development. However, with appropriate design, breakwaters can develop diverse and abundant coral communities with comparable coral cover, demographics, and growth rates to those on the natural reef in Dubai.",,,,,,,,,32,1,0,0,28,0,33,,,0007-4977,,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Windsor, Windsor, ON N9B 3P4, CanadaUnited Nations Univ, Int Network Water Environm & Hlth UNU INWEH, Hamilton, ON L8P 0A1, Canada",United Nations Univ,,,2010-10-01,WOS:000283281600006,,

Whether ARs actually produce biomass, or only attract fish from natural zones, is strongly debated. Using stable isotope ratios to elucidate the trophic organization of the largest Mediterranean artificial reef system, the present work demonstrates that the studied ARs effectively support biomass production, as invertebrate species directly depended on locally produced organic matter (OM). OM of pelagic origin was the main source of matter due to the predominance of filter-feeder organisms on the ARs, while benthic primary production was of secondary importance. Isotopic ratios of fishes confirmed the importance of the ARs as a food supplier. Their position in the trophic network was consistent with the hypothesis proposing the effective ability of ARs to increase fish biomass through production mechanisms. Carbon and nitrogen stable isotope ratios provided a basis for achieving an integrative view of trophic relationships and food web functioning of ARs.

Herein, we describe the colonization process of the recently deployed Faro/Ancao AR, and assess the time until the fish assemblage reaches stability and their seasonal patterns. In addition, we compare the results from the present study with those previously reported for an older AR. The fish assemblages were monitored monthly over a 2-year period by means of visual census. A rapid increase in fish colonization occurred within the first 4 months. After this initial period the assemblage structure showed high similarity (> 73%). The high rate of colonization of the AR was related to the maturity already achieved by the nearby 14-year-old AR and to the fish migration from the Ria Formosa lagoon, a nearby nursery habitat. The reef fish assemblage structure showed a seasonal pattern, mainly associated with recruitment episodes of occasional demersal species (Boops boops, Trachurus trachurus and Pagellus spp.) in spring and summer. A total of 66% of the species found in AR are of commercial and recreational importance. The overall mean density and biomass were 2.8 ind.m(-3) and 207 g.m(-3). The occasional demersal species accounted for 42% of the fish density. The most important species in terms of biomass belong to the Sparidae family along with Dicentrarchus labrax. The fish assemblage of the new ARs showed higher mean number of species, diversity, density and biomass values than those reported for the older AR. This result was associated with enlargement of the AR area and with the fishing exploitation of the isolated, small and patchy old AR. Moreover, the high biomass values recorded in the new ARs were mainly due to the increased density of D. labrax after AR enlargement.

Recruitment of the experimental artificial reef was by 27 taxa of algae and sessile invertebrates. Except during an hypoxia event, hydrographic parameters generally did not correlate with diversity obtained from both recruitment and succession studies from 1993 to 1995. This indicates that the hydrography of Hoi Ha Wan was not the major factor governing changes in recruitment diversity patterns, and Hoi Ha Wan is suitable for artificial reef deployment with regard to water quality. Most of the colonizing sessile invertebrates showed year round recruitment with peaks matching spawning periods. Polychaetes, bivalves and ascidians showed an extended settlement period in summer and autumn. Algae and sponges were recruited in winter. Bryozoans and barnacles generally recruited year round. The pioneer colonizers of the artificial reef were, therefore, a feature of the deployment season. Most recruits settled on the laterally exposed and top surfaces of the reef blocks whereas the sheltered and bottom surfaces had the greatest bare areas. The present study shows that PFA (pulverised fuel ash)-containing concrete (25%, 50% and 75% of PFA by volume), does not differ from true concrete in terms of diversity and eveness recruitment studies. Of the 27 recorded attaching species, only seven showed variations in recruitment between block types.

The parsimonious generalized additive model results showed that higher reef fish diversity was associated with southern shallower water, temperature of 25 degrees C, lower levels of dissolved oxygen and chlorophyll a, and rock bottom type. The multivariate generalized linear model identified that month, depth, bottom type, and location significantly influenced the local reef fish; these habitat variables explained 18% of the variation in reef fish community composition.

We test the hypothesis that the structural complexity of urban breakwaters, when compared with adjacent natural rocky intertidal habitats, is a driver of anthropogenic litter accumulation. We determined litter abundances at seven sites (cities) and estimated the structural complexity in both urban breakwaters and adjacent natural habitats from northern to central Chile, spanning a latitudinal gradient of similar to 15 degrees (18 degrees S to 33 degrees S). Anthropogenic litter density was significantly higher in coastal breakwaters when compared to natural habitats (similar to 15.1 items m(-2) on artificial reefs versus 7.4 items m(-2) in natural habitats) at all study sites, a pattern that was temporally persistent. Different litter categories were more abundant on the artificial reefs than in natural habitats, with local human population density and breakwater extension contributing to increase the probabilities of litter occurrence by similar to 10%. In addition, structural complexity was about two-fold higher on artificial reefs, with anthropogenic litter density being highest at intermediate levels of structural complexity. Therefore, the spatial structure characteristic of artificial reefs seems to enhance anthropogenic litter accumulation, also leading to higher residence time and degradation potential. Our study highlights the interaction between coastal urban habitat modification by establishment of artificial reefs, and pollution. This emergent phenomenon is an important issue to be considered in future management plans and the engineering of coastal ecosystems. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

In this study, hook-and-line fishing gears were used to collect fishes, which were similar to those used in the local recreational fisheries. The longitude and latitude of sampling sites and artificial reef sites were recorded, and the horizontal distance from sampling site to its nearest artificial reef site (distance off reef) was figured out. Catches included Sebastes schlegeli Hexagrammos otakii, Sebastiscus marmoratus and Chelidonichthys spinosus, of which the individuals of Sebastes schlegeli accounted for 82. 58%. SPSS 19. 0 was used to analyze the relationships between the total length, the yield per unit effort (YPUE) of Sebastes schlegeli and the distance off reef. Significant difference was observed between total length, YPUE and the distance off reef. The results showed that the larger the fish was, the more probably it emerged in the areas near the artificial reef site. The difference in movements related to the total length may be attributed to foraging behaviors. Larger fish may realize a greater forging success using a sedentary ambush strategy. As a contrast, smaller fish may be more likely to actively pursue appropriate prey which seemed to be less abundant in the areas near artificial reef site. This could explain why they tended to have higher movement probabilities than larger fish. YPUE declined with the increase of the distance off reef, which meant the density of reef fishes decreased as the sampling site set farther away from the artificial reef. Two types of YPUE were standardized in this study. YPUE1 stood for the yield of fishes hooked by every angler per minute, while YPUE2 stood for the yield of fishes hooked by every angler per drop. The equation between YPUE1 and x representing the distance off the reef is YPUE1 = 681. 474 108. 886(lnx). The equation between YPUE2 and x is YPUE2 =186. 597+17374. 787/x. Both YPUE1 and YPUE2 have a significant negative correlation with the distance off reef, while YPUE1 seemed to have a more significant correlation than YPUE2 (-0. 730 vs -0. 692). This may be owed to the frequency of drops in every sampling site, which was twice at most. The results on the distribution of reef fishes in this study may be a reference for commercial fishing. The more fish appeared in the areas around the reef site, the more catches there would be. Hook-and-line fishing gears were not widely used in the marine investigation and experiments in China so far. However, the research design of this study may accelerate the development of recreational fishery in which fishing with hook-and-line gears was one of the most important entertainment forms. Meanwhile, the research also reflected that the artificial reefs did well in fish-gathering effect, which may aid to making further progress in the similar study.",,,,,,,,,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,,,1672-5174,,,,,,,,,,,"Ocean Univ China, Coll Fisheries, Qingdao, 266003, China",,,,2017-03-30,ZOOREC:ZOOR15304024211,,

On natural and artificial reefs, adult giant kelp plants were more common on low-relief substrates, i.e., on hard substrates lying less than 1 m above the surrounding sand. Conversely, juvenile kelp, kelp-fouling organisms, and kelp-grazing fish were more common on high-relief substrates. There was no statistically significant relationship between the density of sea urchins and bottom relief. The effects of fish grazing, but not the effects of abrasion and sea urchin grazing, are probably much greater on kelp plants that are partially encrusted with fouling organisms. To study fish grazing, fouled sections of adult kelp plants were exposed on high and low relief. To study abrasion and sea urchin grazing, unfouled sections of adult kelp plants were similarly exposed. On both artificial and natural reefs, fouled sections of kelp plants lost significantly more tissue on high relief; unfouled sections did not. The results indicated that the relationship of giant kelp density to bottom relief was produced by differences in fish grazing which were, in turn, produced by the higher densities of kelp-grazing fish or kelp-fouling organisms on high relief. The data did not suggest that the relationship between kelp density and bottom relief was produced by abrasion, sea urchin grazing, or kelp recruitment. Finally, the data suggest that a reef intended to support giant kelp should be designed to minimize bottom relief and the number of shelter crevices suitable for kelp-grazing fish.",,,,,,,,,10,0,0,0,4,0,12,,,0007-4977,,,,,,,,,,,"DEPT FISH & GAME,LONG BEACH,CA 90802SO CALIF EDISON CO,ROSEMEAD,CA 91770",DEPT FISH & GAMESO CALIF EDISON CO,,,1994-09-01,WOS:A1994QB58400031,,

Studying recruitment processes to experimental settlement plates attached to ARs and NRs reveal the factors that shape community structure at the two reef types, and determine the ability of an AR to support communities similar to those found in adjacent natural habitats. In this study, conducted in Eilat (Red Sea), we used settlement plates to test the hypothesis that differences in benthic communities between ARs and NRs are derived from differential recruitment processes. A monitoring period of 18 months revealed great differences in the recruitment of corals and other benthic communities between the studied ARs and adjacent NRs. The ARs were either made of PVC or metal and 10-17 years old when the study commenced. The recruitment of soft corals reflected the species assemblage found in the area, consisting mainly of the family Nephtheidae and Xeniidae, species, while that of stony corals was mostly determined by the life history traits of the recruited taxa, e.g., the opportunistic nature of the family Pocilloporidae. Benthic organisms, mainly filter feeders like bryozoans, bivalves, sponges and tunicates, were more abundant at the ARs than at the NRs, mainly on the underside of the plates. We suggest that this differential recruitment resulted from a synergistic effect of abiotic and biotic factors, including current regime, sedimentation load and larval settlement preferences, which subsequently differentiated the composition of the benthic communities at the ARs and NRs. Thus, in order to construct an AR for restoration purposes, it must offer similar structural features to those found in the natural surrounding, leading to recruitment of local taxa. However, if the AR and NR will differ structurally, the composition of recruits will also differ and eventually the communities at the two reef types will become distinct, hereby increasing the species diversity in the area.

For this purpose, a DSS is proposed which, based on cartographic information and using objective and quantifiable criteria, allows comparative assessments and analyses between different project alternatives. The analytical procedures used by the system include, among others, hydrodynamic modeling tools and visual impact simulators. In addition, impacts on marine species are assessed taking into account intrinsic ecological and biological aspects. The magnitude of the impacts is quantified by means of fuzzy logic operations and the integration of all the elements is carried out by an interactive multi-criteria analysis. The results are shown in tables, graphs and figures of easy interpretation and can be also visualized geographically by means of a cartographic viewer.The system identifies the main impacts generated in the different phases of the project and allows establishing adequate mitigation measures in search of optimized solutions. The establishment of the assessment criteria has been based on the abundant, but dispersed, scientific literature on the various elements of the system and having the opinion of experts in the various fields.

ARs located in suitable locations have the ability to significantly enhance fisheries resources. Experience in other countries indicates that a successful AR programme must involve controls on fishing effort. Without such controls ARs act as fish aggregating devices, leading to overfishing, if deployed in heavily exploited areas. The powers contained in the Marine Parks Ordinance allow for controls on all fishing activities within marine parks and prohibit fishing in marine reserves. Two areas at Yan Chau Tong and Hoi Ha Wan have been designated as marine parks but deployment of ARs within these sites would impact a relatively small area. Clearly if any significant impacts are to be made on the Hong Kong marine ecosystem and fisheries resources then ARs must be deployed over a much wider area than the currently designated marine parks. The opportunity to select suitable ARs sites in tandem with Marine Protected Areas selection is detailed. A number of offshore sites appear to have excellent potential for AR development and are strong candidates as marine parks and marine reserves. By creating marine reserves in core areas of natural high conservation value rocky coastline and reef such as Ping Chau and Breakers Reef some of the finest quality marine habitat in Hong Kong waters would be protected from over-exploitation.

J,,,,,,,,,Michael Brown,,Screw piles for wind energy foundation systems,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Awarded Grant,Feb 26 2016,2016,"Screw (or helical) piles are foundations which are screwed into the ground. They are widely used onshore for supporting motorway signs and gantries as they possess good tensile and compressive resistance. This project aims to make screw piles a more attractive foundation (or anchoring) option offshore for wind farms, which are being deployed in deeper water and subject to increasing performance demands. The UK has challenging targets for expansion of energy from renewables with the potential for over 5000 offshore wind turbines by 2020. The necessary move to deeper water will increase cost and put greater demands on subsea structures and foundations. The current foundation solutions being considered for these applications are driven piles, large monopiles or concrete gravity based structures (GBS). Driving of piles in large numbers offshore causes concerns over plant availability and impact on marine mammals. There are also concerns over the limit of practical monopile development and the high material demands of GBS. Screw piles have the potential to overcome these issues and are scalable for future development from current onshore systems which have relatively low noise installation and are efficient in terms of both tensile and compressive capacity. To meet offshore demands, screw piles will require geometry enhancement but it is envisaged that these will initially be modest to allow de-risked transfer of onshore technology offshore. This will lead to the deployment of several smaller piles or pile groups rather than moving straight to very large single screw piles that may prove difficult to install and require significant investment. To allow screw piles to be considered as a foundation solution for offshore wind this project will develop piles with optimised geometries that minimise resistance to installation but are capable of carrying high lateral and moment loads. In order to install screw piles torque devices are used to effectively screw the anchors into the ground. With increased pile size requirements and potential changes in geometry this project will develop improved, less empirical techniques to predict the torque required in a variety of soil conditions. This will allow confidence in pile installation and investment in appropriately sized installation plant. As new pile geometries are being developed these will need to be tested (through model, numerical and field testing in this project) to verify that they can meet the performance demands of the offshore environment. The project will also develop bespoke analysis techniques to allow consulting geotechnical engineers the tools they require to design the foundations and contractors the tools to inform the installation processes. As piles can be deployed as large single units or smaller units in groups the efficiency of group deployment and multiple foundation geometries will be explored, as using several smaller geometry foundations could reduce the risks during offshore installation and actually be more economic due to lower fabrication costs and demands on installation plant. The areas of investigation above will be combined to produce a design and decision making toolkit for use by geotechnical designers to allow deployment of screw piles as offshore foundations in an efficient and cost effective manner.The research has the potential to make it easier to deploy screw pile foundations for offshore renewables. This project will develop foundations able to deal with current water depths and will provide understanding of the behaviour of piles as water depths and the demands on the foundations increase. By harnessing the installation and performance benefits of screw pile/anchor technology, the results of the project will contribute to an overall cost reduction in electricity generated by renewable means and increase the public's confidence in the future viability of this energy source.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,EP/N006054/1,,,,,,,,University of Dundee,,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:15340039,,

Two vessels were used as artificial reefs off Sal Island (Cape Verde) in 2006 and 2008, with the aim of bolstering the local economy through ecotourism. The additional economic value anticipated was to: (i) enhance fish aggregation as well as other marine organisms, and (ii) mitigate human pressure on natural reefs by diverting divers. The supply-side view of diving trips was tested and analysed over a 4-year period (2008-2011) in the choice of divers between natural and artificial reefs, as well as such reef attributes as reef depth, reef distance from the main pier in Santa Maria Bay, and the year-season as well as combinations thereof. Data were also analysed to determine if the deployed reefs off Sal Island had a complementary or a substitute function. It was observed that the presence of artificial reefs created more dive users, but that divers who used these reefs were not deterred from diving at natural reefs. This resulted in a low-diversion effect (low substitutability). Thus, dive operators can offer additional options to divers (moderate to highly complementary). The distance to diving sites was the most influential factor in diving decisions (linear model results indicated 15 more divers at distances closer to Santa Maria Bay than elsewhere). From the log-linear model the number of divers would be expected to change, the distance being the most influential factor (11.7 times higher at closer sites); reef type and depth were less influential (0.2 times fewer divers at artificial reefs; 2.3 times more divers in shallower waters). Also apparent was that the depth of the reef was fundamental in the diver niche allocation throughout the seasons.",,,,,10th International Conference on Artificial Reefs and Related Aquatic Habitats (CARAH)10th International Conference on Artificial Reefs and Related Aquatic Habitats (CARAH),"SEP 23-27, 2013SEP 23-27, 2013",,"Izmir, TURKEYIzmir, TURKEY",8,0,0,0,5,0,9,,,0175-8659,1439-0426,,,,,,,,,,"Oceanario Lisboa SA, P-1990005 Lisbon, PortugalUniv Algarve, Ctr Marine Sci CCMAR, Faro, PortugalInst Portugues Mar & Atmosfera IPMA IP, Olhao, Portugal",Oceanario Lisboa SA,,,2016-01-13,WOS:000367072400010,,

Predators are often assumed to have independent and additive effects on shared prey survival; however, multiple predator effects can be non-additive if predators foraging together reduce prey survival (risk enhancement) or increase prey survival through interference (risk reduction). In marine communities, juvenile reef fish experience very high mortality from two predator guilds with very different hunting modes and foraging domains-benthic and pelagic predator guilds. The few previous predator manipulation studies have found or assumed that mortality is independent and additive. We tested whether interacting predator guilds result in non-additive prey mortality and whether the detection of such effects change over time as prey are depleted. To do so, we examined the roles of benthic and pelagic predators on the survival of a juvenile shoaling zooplanktivorous temperate reef fish, Trachinops caudimaculatus, on artificial patch reefs over 2 months in Port Phillip Bay, Australia. We observed risk enhancement in the first 7 days, as shoaling behaviour placed prey between predator foraging domains with no effective refuge. At day 14 we observed additive mortality, and risk enhancement was no longer detectable. By days 28 and 62, pelagic predators were no longer significant sources of mortality and additivity was trivial. We hypothesize that declines in prey density led to reduced shoaling behaviour that brought prey more often into the domain of benthic predators, resulting in limited mortality from pelagic predators. Furthermore, pelagic predators may have spent less time patrolling reefs in response to declines in prey numbers. Our observation of the changing interaction between predators and prey has important implications for assessing the role of predation in regulating populations in complex communities.",,,,,,,,,14,0,0,0,13,0,14,,,0029-8549,,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Melbourne, Dept Zool, Parkville, Vic 3010, Australia",,,,2013-07-03,WOS:000319077100008,23124272,

We tested the effect of diver profile, reef type, use of additional equipment, timing, and group size on diver behavior and their contacts with benthic organisms. Eighty-eight percent of divers contacted benthic organism at least once, with an average of eight touches and one damage per dive. No significant differences in contacts were verified among gender, group size, or experience level. Artificial reef received a higher rate of contact than pinnacle and fringe reefs. Specialist photographers and sidemount users had the highest rates, while non-users of additional equipment and mini camera users had the lowest contact rates.

Embiotocids provide an interesting model for reef-fish production because they are viviparous and their entire ontogeny can be observed on the reefs. We deduce that the two reef populations of both species were stable at their carrying capacity. This carrying capacity was greater in King Harbor throughout the study. We also report a linear decline in survival of juveniles of both species over the 25-year period. Overall regional processes were similar on the two reefs, yet temporal differences suggested that they were acting independently.

Depending on the microbial community and surrounding environment, they may either contribute to the wreck's preservation or deterioration. Even within a single wreck, preservation and deterioration processes may vary, suggesting that the microbial community may also vary. This study aimed to identify the differences through widespread sampling of the microbial communities associated with the Pappy Lane shipwreck (NC shipwreck site #PAS0001), a shallow water ferrous-hulled shipwreck in Pamlico Sound, North Carolina to determine if there are differences across the wreck as well as from its surrounding environment. Loose shipwreck debris, drilled shipcores, surrounding sediment, and seawater samples were collected from the Pappy Lane shipwreck to characterize the microbial communities on and around the shipwreck. Results indicated that the shipwreck samples were more similar to each other than the surrounding sediment and aquatic environments suggesting they have made a specialized niche associated with the shipwreck. There were differences between the microbial community across the shipwreck, including between visibly corroded and non-corroded shipwreck debris pieces. Relative abundance estimates for neutrophilic iron-oxidizing bacteria (FeOB), an organism that may contribute to deterioration through biocorrosion, revealed they are present across the shipwreck and at highest abundance on the samples containing visible corrosion products.Zetaproteobacteria, a known class of marine iron-oxidizers, were also found in higher abundance on shipwreck samples with visible corrosion. A novelZetaproteobacteriastrain,Mariprofundus ferrooxydansO1, was isolated from one of the shipwreck pieces and its genome analyzed to elucidate the functional potential of the organism. In addition to iron oxidation pathways, the isolate has the genomic potential to perform carbon fixation in both high and low oxygen environments, as well as perform nitrogen fixation, contributing to the overall biogeochemical cycling of nutrients and metals in the shipwreck ecosystem.

From the results, the following conclusions were made. First, if the installation velocity is less than 1m/s during the AR installation with the cables, the initial settlements of a fixed seabed condition are generally similar. Second, the initial settlement of the seabed increases when the contact angle with the cube-type AR increases. Third, the initial settlement occurs considerably when the ARs are installed on the seabed composed of saturated sand and clay.

Modelled distributions showed a clear effect of distance from the reef for fish both in the water column and the bottom, where there was generally a close association with the reef.

The research hypothesis was that the placement of small, structurally complex artificial reef modules would increase fish abundance and species richness relative to unmodified marina seawalls. Nondestructive visual surveys of fishes were completed monthly for 14 months for 12 artificial reef sites and 12 control (unmodified) sites within a small marina. Divers recorded species, abundance, and size class (0-2 cm, >2-5 cm, >5-10 cm, >10-20 cm, >20-30 cm, >30-50 cm, and >50 cm) for all sites. Data was statistically analyzed using analysis of variance and a post-hoc Student Newman-Keuls test. Total mean fish abundance and mean species richness were both significantly higher at artificial reef sites than at control sites. Analysis of mean abundance by size class found that the >2-5 cm, >5-10 cm, >10-20 cm, and >20-30 cm classes were significantly higher for artificial reef sites. Species richness analysis by size class found that classes >2-5 cm, >5-10 cm, >10-20 cm, and >20-30 cm were significantly higher at artificial reef sites. Fishes from the grunt (Haemulidae) and snapper (Lutjanidae) families contributed the most to the total abundance for both types of sites. These results support the research hypothesis and have vital implications for mitigating ecological impact to coastal fish nursery areas with the use of artificial structure.",,,,,,,,,15,0,0,0,14,0,16,,,0749-0208,1551-5036,,,,,,,,,,"Nova Southeastern Univ, Halmos Coll Nat Sci & Oceanog, Dania, FL 33004 USAUniv Paul Valery Montpellier, Univ Montpellier, CEFE UMR 5175, CNRS, Montpellier 5, France",,,,2017-11-01,WOS:000415373200009,,

The Ocean SAMP applies the inclusive, ecosystem-based approach to marine spatial planning recommended by the National Ocean Commission in 2004 that is a feature of the National Ocean Policy promulgated in 2010. It places within a larger spatial planning context the impact assessment process that is the basis for the issuance of leases and permits requested by a developer for a specified activity at a defined marine site. The Ocean SAMP was prepared over a two and a half year period of information generation, analysis, consultation, planning and policy making prompted by the need to identify potentially suitable sites for anticipated offshore wind farms. Its highly consultative approach builds upon the 30 years of experience of the Rhode Island Coastal Program in developing and implementing special area management plans (SAMPs) for coastal and marine areas where conflicts over needs for both development and conservation demand special attention and negotiation among stakeholders with different interests. The phases in the development and approval of the Ocean SAMP, and the prospects for successful implementation are examined through frameworks suggested for the preparation of a governance baseline put forward by the international Land Ocean Interactions in the Coastal Zone (LOICZ) program.

It is located at 10-14 m depth on a sandy-silty seabed in the Tyrrhenian Sea, 5 nmi north of the outlet of the Tevere River (Latium, Italy) and 1.5 nmi offshore the town of Fregene (Latium, Italy). The development of the polychaete community on the reef was studied from May 1981 to December 2001 in order to examine long-term community dynamics and verify to what extent changes in polychaete assemblage could depict the development of the benthic assemblage. At each sampling time, two standard surfaces of 400 cm(2) were scraped from the vertical walls of the same block. Temporal changes in the development of the polychaete community were detected by univariate (S, N, ExpH', 1/Simpson, J') and multivariate (CLUSTER, nMDS) analysis of the faunal data. Functional structure of the community was also analyzed. Changes in the community structure were shown by an overall increasing trend in the total number of species and individuals. The 20-year development of the polychaete community was divided into five different phases representing different benthic assemblages on the reef: the first two periods correspond to settlement of pioneer species (1981-82); the third is a phase characterized by Mytilus galloprovincialis dominance and regression (1983-85); the fourth is a phase of mud accumulation between dead balanids, with the presence of laminar bryozoans (1991-92), and the last corresponds to a phase dominated by bryozoan bioconstruction (2001). The increased complexity in the benthic assemblage and substratum on the reef is also shown by an increased differentiation and distribution of polychaete functional groups. Increasing environmental heterogeneity on the reef is the basic factor that affected biodiversity by generating new niches that could be occupied by additional species with different ecology. The similarity of the benthic assemblage observed on the reef in 2001 with natural bioconstructions suggest that after two decades the ecological succession has lead to a settlement at a steady-state of equilibrium with the surrounding environment.",,,,,9th International Polychaete Conference9th International Polychaete Conference,"AUG 12-17, 2007AUG 12-17, 2007",,"Portland, MEPortland, ME",10,0,0,0,8,0,10,,,1178-9913,,978-1-86977-374-8; 978-1-86977-373-1,,,,,,,,,"ISPRA, Inst Environm Protect & Res, Via Casalotti 300, I-00166 Rome, ItalyUniv Roma La Sapienza, I-00185 Rome, Italy",,,,2009-01-01,WOS:000277952400038,,

However, some species can adapt and even benefit from such modifications. Artificial reefs have long been used to provide habitat for invertebrate communities and promote local fish populations. With the increasing demand for energy resources within ocean systems, there has been an expansion of infrastructure in near-shore benthic environments which function as de facto artificial reefs. Little is known of their use by marine mammals. In this study, the influence of anthropogenic sea floor structures (pipelines, cable routes, wells and shipwrecks) on the foraging locations of 36 adult female Australian fur seals (Arctocephalus pusillus doriferus) was investigated. For 9 (25%) of the individuals, distance to anthropogenic sea floor structures was the most important factor in determining the location of intensive foraging activity. Whereas the influence of anthropogenic sea floor structures on foraging locations was not related to age and mass, it was positively related to flipper length/standard length (a factor which can affect manoeuvrability). A total of 26 (72%) individuals tracked with GPS were recorded spending time in the vicinity of structures (from <1% to >75% of the foraging trip duration) with pipelines and cable routes being the most frequented. No relationships were found between the amount of time spent frequenting anthropogenic structures and individual characteristics.

All current methods for estimating habitat values of coastal marine sites rely heavily on the opinion of experts or on data variables that can readily be manipulated to influence the outcome. As a result, unbiased, quantitative comparisons between the values of different marine habitats are generally unavailable. We report here on a robust, objective technique for the valuation of marine habitats that makes use of data that are commonly gathered in surveys of marine fish populations: density, fidelity, and mean size. To insure comparability across habitats, these variables are assessed for guilds of fishes, rather than for single species. The product of the three guild-based parameters is transformed to its square root and then summed across all guilds in the habitat, yielding a single measure of habitat value for each site surveyed. To demonstrate the usefulness of this approach, we have analyzed data from existing surveys of 13 marine sites in the Southern California Eight, encompassing 98 fish species from 23 guilds. For seven of the sites, it was possible to develop estimates of the confidence interval of the habitat valuation, using a resampling technique. Variance estimates from resampling in one habitat mirrored those derived from analysis of annual variation. The resultant ranking of habitat types was: kelp beds > shallow artificial reefs > wetlands > protected shallow waters (soft bottom) > shallow open coastal sand (depth <30 m) > soft bottom habitat on the continental shelf (30 m < depth <200 m) > soft bottom habitat on the continental slope (depth >200 m). Although our data sets were restricted to Southern California, similar data could be obtained from any reasonably well-studied marine environment. The guild-based valuation technique may, therefore, be broadly applicable to the analysis of other marine ecosystems.",,,,,,,,,22,0,0,0,16,0,27,,,0007-4977,1553-6955,,,,,,,,,,"Occidental Coll, Vantuna Res Grp, Zool Lab, Los Angeles, CA 90041 USAUniv Nebraska, Sch Biol Sci, Lincoln, NE 68588 USASo Calif Coastal Water Res Project, Westminster, CA 92683 USANatl Marine Fisheries Serv, Santa Rosa, CA 95404 USA",,,,1999-03-01,WOS:000079983200004,,

The red-throated diver (Gavia stellata) has been reported to be sensitive to ship traffic and other anthropogenic pressures and is consequently of high conservation concern. We studied red-throated divers in the German Bight (North Sea) using satellite telemetry and digital aerial surveys with the aim of assessing effects of ship traffic on the distribution and movements of this species during the non-breeding season. Data from the automatic identification system of ships (AIS) were intersected with bird data and allowed detailed spatial and temporal analyses. During the study period, ship traffic was present throughout the main distribution area of divers. Depending on impact radius, only small areas existed in which ship traffic was present on less than 20% of the days. Ship traffic was dominated by fishing vessels and cargo ships, but also wind farm-related ships were frequently recorded. Red-throated divers were more abundant in areas with no or little concurrent ship traffic. Analysis of aerial survey data revealed strong effects of ship speed on divers: in areas with vessels sailing at high speed only a slow resettlement of the area was observed after the disturbance, while in areas with vessels sailing at medium speed the resettlement was more rapid during the observed time period of 7 hours. Data from satellite-tracking of divers suggest that large relocation distances of individuals are related to disturbance by ships which often trigger birds to take flight.

Hard bottom areas were sampled with wooden fish traps from April to early December 1987. Mean catch per trap and total length were determined for the most commonly caught species. Black sea bass comprised over 96% of the catch overall. The other abundant species were: spotted hake (Urophycis regia), tautog (Tautoga onitis), red hake (Urophycis chuss), conger eel (Conger oceanicus), scup (Stenotomus chrysops), and ocean pout (Macrozoarces americanus). The catches of each species fluctuated through time, apparently as a result of seasonal migration patterns. Most species appeared to migrate inshore in the spring and offshore in the autumn. Ocean pout had not previously been reported to occur south of Delaware and was most abundant during the time of the coldest temperatures. The fish community on hard bottom areas in the Middle Atlantic Bight (MAB) had not been adequately described previously owing to the limitation of trawl nets sampling rough bottom. The hard bottom reef fish community differs considerably from that reported from South Atlantic Bight reef areas as well as from smooth bottom areas on the MAB continental shelf.

The SLOCAR project was developed to (1) determine whether an artificial reef could be designed to encourage algal development which provides habitat for blue, olive, and yellowtail young-of-the-year (YOY) rockfish species, (2) assess whether YOY recruitment at the artificial reef site would compare favorably to the local natural reef habitat, and (3) determine if annual fish recruitment to the artificial reefs would continue over time. Two local natural reef sites (NRS) were selected for comparison purposes. Studies were conducted using SCUBA at SLOCAR and NRS during the months of July and August from 1986 through 1990. Algal assemblage surveys were performed to estimate percent cover of foliose red algae and densities of Pterygophora californica (palm kelp) and Nereocystis luetkeana (bull kelp) at each location. The densities of the surface-canopy forming Nereocystis were initially greater at SLOCAR than NRS. However, Nereocystis densities at SLOCAR declined over the course of the study. In addition, temporal changes in the densities of Pterygophora and percent cover foliose red algae suggested the artificial reef's algal community was comparable to the local natural reefs. Blue rockfish, yellowtail rockfish, and olive rockfish comprised 96% of all young-of-the-year (YOY) rockfish observed at SLOCAR and 95% of all YOY observed at NRS. In general, densities of YOY at the four SLOCAR modules equaled or exceeded the densities of YOY at the two NRS modules during the first 3 years of the study. Over the remaining 2 years, YOY rockfish densities were similar among all the sites. We believe the different algal compositions between SLOCAR and NRS were one of the primary factors contributing to the initial differences in YOY densities observed between the artificial and natural reef sites. The higher YOY densities at SLOCAR during the first 3 years appear to have been, in part, attributable to the higher densities of the canopy forming kelp Nereocystis. As the algal community matured and Nereocystis densities declined at SLOCAR, YOY densities became more similar to the densities observed at NRS.",,,,,,,,,12,0,0,0,7,0,13,,,0007-4977,,,,,,,,,,,"PACIFIC GAS & ELECT CO,AVILA BEACH,CA 93424RSI SERV CORP,VILLA PK,CA 92667",RSI SERV CORP,,,1994-09-01,WOS:A1994QB58400007,,

Seawalls typically lack the complex microhabitats and protective spaces of natural shorelines and consequently organisms that settle on them may be particularly susceptible to predation. We tested whether the addition of complex microhabitats to seawalls enhances the survivorship of oysters, key habitat-forming species on intertidal shores, by reducing the intensity of predation. At two sites in Sydney Harbour, we compared the magnitude and sources of mortality of juvenile oysters among (1) flat tiles, without crevices or ridges; (2) complex tiles, with 2.5 cm high ridges, separated by crevices; and (3) complex tiles, with 5 cm high ridges, separated by crevices. We also compared predatory fish visitation and feeding among sites and treatments using GoPro (R) cameras. The abundance and feeding of predatory fish was much greater at one of the study sites than the other, but at neither site differed among treatments. At the site with greater predatory fish abundances, survivorship of juvenile oysters was 50% greater on the 5 cm complex tiles than flat tiles, and on complex tiles approximately 300% greater in crevices than on ridges. Of the dead oysters, almost all were cracked, indicative of fish predation. In contrast, at the site with fewer predatory fish, there were no detectable differences in oyster survivorship between treatments. These results suggest that the addition of complex habitat to seawalls could be an effective strategy in reducing fish predation pressure on juvenile oysters at sites with abundant predatory fish. A greater understanding of the site-specific pressures is required to enhance the abundances of desirable species and functions on seawalls. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

The main discrepancies in data regarded crypto-benthic and nekto-benthic species, whereas the ROV proved to be a suitable method to census low-mobile and abundant planktivorous species. The differences between the fish assemblage described by the ROV, with respect to the one depicted by UVC, should be considered in the light of the technical limits of the recording camera, whose resolution and field of vision is clearly lower than the diver's eye. In addition, video images did not allow for the acquisition of a correct estimate of the distance between the individuals and the platform structures. This led, almost certainly, to an under- or over-estimation of fish abundance as regards to the censused volume.

Current state and federal laws and regulations allow for alternative uses in lieu of the complete removal required in existing leases. Any decommissioning pathway will create a complex mix of costs, benefits, opportunities, and constraints for multiple user groups. To assist the California Natural Resources Agency in understanding these issues, we evaluated the potential socioeconomic impacts of the 2 most likely options: complete removal and partial removal of the structure to 85 feet below the waterline with the remaining structure left in place as an artificial reef-generally defined as a manmade structure with some properties that mimic a natural reef. We estimated impacts on commercial fishing, commercial shipping, recreational fishing, nonconsumptive boating, and nonconsumptive SCUBA diving. Available data supported quantitative estimates for some impacts, semiquantitative estimates for others, and only qualitative approximations of the direction of impact for still others. Even qualitative estimates of the direction of impacts and of user groups' likely preferred options have been useful to the public and decision makers and provided valuable input to the project's integrative decision model. Uncertainty surrounds even qualitative estimates of the likely direction of impact where interactions between multiple impacts could occur or where user groups include subsets that would experience the same option differently. In addition, we were unable to quantify effects on ecosystem value and on the larger regional ecosystem, because of data gaps on the population sizes and dynamics of key species and the uncertainty surrounding the contribution of platforms to available hard substrate and related natural populations offshore southern California.

Numerous works have studied temporal patterns of Benthic Invertebrate Biophonies (BIB) and linked them to environmental parameters or ecological processes, but there is a lack of knowledge about the spatial variability of BIB. Here, we mapped Benthic Invertebrate Sounds (BIS) in three dimensions using a compact array (2 m x 2 m x 2 m) of four hydrophones within the scope of eco-acoustics studies. Firstly, we developed tools to localize any individual sound emitted by benthic invertebrates. A theoretical calculation of the Cramer Rao Bounds (CRB) consolidated by in situ active emissions from known positions, demonstrated the accuracy of the localization. Secondly, by accumulating all the positions of the BIS recorded during a night, three methods are proposed to map the BIB at different spatial scales. An in situ measurement campaign carried out on a 300 m x 300 m artificial reef system revealed that the marine fauna was binary spatially distributed: rich and numerous on artificial reefs and poor and weak outside the reefs. At small ranges (10 m), the acoustic maps matched the geometric structures of the reefs with an accuracy of 0.5 m. At large scales (100 m and 300 m), the acoustic hot-spots on the maps corresponded to distant reefs, with an accuracy of 7 m and 10 m respectively.This study provides the first maps of the BIB at ecologically relevant scales and shows that they can be used to identify, quantify, follow and track benthic activity hot-spots. In combination with biological and ecological information, passive acoustic monitoring using such maps can be a powerful complementary tool for ecological studies, such as the quantification of grazing activity or the evaluation of the efficiency of marine ecologic restoration programs.

The academic partners listed above are collaborating to establish the proposed center, with UMA as the lead institution. The proposed Center is motivated by the possibility of integrating engineering with ocean and atmospheric sciences to support the development of systems with low cost of energy and high reliability. The thrust areas include: oceanography and geology as it relates to preparing wind turbine sites, turbine design, environmental effects, particularly impact on flying wildlife, land use, and system management and integration into the electrical grid. The proposed work has a very good focus on a well-defined area that is of long-term importance to energy generation in the US. The investigators have an excellent background, and will provide the needed expertise to expand the use of wind power for electrical generation. The work by the proposed Center will make wind energy, particularly off-shore wind energy, more competitive with energy from non-renewable sources. The proposed Center would build on Amherst's wind research program, consolidating all aspects of wind power into a single unit. The Center plans to increase the diversity of participants in wind energy research and industry. Since UMA is the lead institution for the Northeast Alliance for Graduate Education and the Professoriate (NEAGEP), the NEAGEP infrastructure will be available to the proposed I/UCRC. ODU has strong research and academic ties with Hampton University and Norfolk State University, both designated as HBCUs.

GARC was developed with industrial waste including GBFS, SS and flue gas desulfurization gypsum as the major raw materials. Physical properties and compressive strength development of the prepared GARC were examined. Hydration products of GARC paste were investigated through X-ray diffraction, differential scanning calorimetry and scanning electron microscope techniques. The developed GARC shows a 28-day compressive strength of 71.4 MPa and a density of 2765.5 kg/m(3), which contains industrial waste accounting for 98% by weight of its total solid raw materials. Investigation of hydration products in GARC paste reveals that the major hydration products are ettringite and C-S-H gel with a very dense microstructure, without considerable amount of portlandite that is commonly found in traditional concrete. The absence of portlandite is favorable for lowering the pH valve of artificial reefs, which would be benefit for avoiding the accumulation of fouling organisms like barnacles on the surface of concrete artificial reefs. An experimental-scale deployment of GARC specimens in the sea preliminarily demonstrates that GARC is suitable for the attachment growth of algae. The successful development of GARC mainly composed of GBFS and SS could potentially offer great benefits in promoting the sustainable development of steel manufacturers closely located to coastline as well as fishery industry.

Thus, diel feeding habits of red snapper on artificial reefs were examined using gut fullness, diet composition, and prey habitat preferences. Red snapper were collected by hook and line from artificial reefs off Alabama in July and Aug. 2000. Examination of stomach contents found red snapper feeding upon fish, demersal crustaceans, and pelagic zooplankton. Although other studies suggest that lutjanids primarily feed nocturnally, red snapper in this study fed throughout the day and night. Significant differences in gut fullness were found between 2-hr time intervals; however, no obvious pattern in feeding periodicity was evident. Although fish was the largest diet component by weight for both day and night during diel sampling, examination of prey habitat preferences indicate that red snapper fed on more water-column organisms during the day and more sand- or mud-associated organisms at night. Based on our interpretation of these results, we hypothesize that red snapper reside above the reefs during the day, opportunistically feeding mostly upon water-column-associated organisms and some benthic prey. At night they may move away from the reef to consume nocturnally active fishes and benthic crustaceans.",,,,,,,,,21,0,0,0,17,0,32,,,1087-688X,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2006-12-01,BCI:BCI200700215350,,

In order to develop Thailand's AR program, the current distribution of ARs and natural reefs was investigated. Also the materials used for AR construction were studied. A high distribution of ARs was found in coastal areas (depth <= 30 m) that lacked natural reefs. Of the total sea areas, shallow water areas (depth <= 10 m) showed to have a higher distribution of ARs with a density ratio of 0.06. AR program's trends from various coastal countries showed that the data presented a wide field of studies on AR in numerous countries, ranging from structure research to physical, biological, and economical monitoring. In comparison, however, a relatively narrow range of studies have been done for Thailand, most of which were concerned with productivity and ecological success. The data also reflected the use of various materials and types of structures in AR construction in other countries, but this variety was not visible in that of Thailand. In addition, while the use of a variety of structures has enabled many countries to deploy ARs in deeper waters to enhance and restore resources, Thailand's AR deployment was shown to only have a high distribution and density ratio of ARs in shallow areas because of the use of relatively primitive structures and deployment methods. Upon comparison of AR programs in various countries, it seems that Thailand lacks the necessary technology, future plans and information about recent trends. Shallow waters (depth <= 10 m) will undoubtedly be important AR deployment sites for the restoration and enhancement resources, but in order to counteract the present environmental damages and decline of marine resources, it will be necessary to conduct a much wider field of studies. In addition, more effective deployment plans should be implemented to focus on deeper waters (depth > 10 m), which may be beneficial for the future AR program development. According to previous studies. AR development in Thailand should be improved with more effective methods of structure construction, planning, and techniques in order to restore the environment and the coastal resources.

The programme is being implemented in two phases. The first phase has involved AR deployment in recently established marine parks. The second phase will involve the establishment of FPA selected specifically for their suitability for AR deployment and fisheries restoration. Prior to site selection, a comprehensive two-stage consultation exercise was conducted, which targeted fishers, marine users and green groups. Ecosystem simulations were employed to assess the potential benefits to fisheries arising from the implementation of the second phase. Modelling results indicate that AR deployment, utilizing 10-20% of local waters managed predominantly as no-take zones, could arrest the current decline in fisheries yield and produce significant improvements within ten years. Limited selective fishing may be authorized at a small number of AR to encourage support from local fishers and facilitate enforcement. Successful implementation must involve a high level of fishing compliance within the 'no-take' zones. Management should be facilitated by establishing community-based advisory groups for each EPA that will comprise representatives from fishers, government and academics. They will be responsible, in addition to providing advice, for assisting with management issues including fishing permit allocation. The benefits and problems associated with different restoration initiatives are discussed. (C) 2002 International Council for the Exploration of the Sea. Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.

In order to increase the necto-benthic colonization potential, an artificial reef was installed on the northern coast of Rio de Janeiro (21[degree]27'S, 41[degree]00'W), an area with typically low relief bottom. Measuring nearly 1500 m2, the reef consisted to four sets of different materials randomly disposed: concrete pipes (N = 12); tires structures (N = 20); and cement tanks (N = 7) and pre-made blocks (N = 4). In order to determine the artificial reef effects on the teleost community, trammel nets were used for monthly sampling the reef site (RA) and on a control area (AC) with sandy bottom. During the 23-month survey from April/96 to March/98, were recorded: a) Chaetodipterus faber (Broussonet, 1782) and Haemulon aurolieatum (Cuvier, 1829) as exclusive species of the RA; b) higher values of species richness and abundance on the RA, at least in 5 of 8 periods; c) increase on the fish abundance on summer months. Correlation analysis indicated that salinity and precipitation were the most significant environmental factors correlated with the temporal fish community variation.

Most of the uncertainty in air-gap calculations comes from our poor knowledge of the distribution of crest heights. The distributions, which have been proposed, differ considerably, largely because different wave sensors appear to give different results.In October 1997, the Metocean Committee of the E&P Forum decided to start the first phase of a Joint Industry Project (JIP) named 'WACSIS' (Wave Crest Sensor Intercomparison Study). This phase is dealing with continuous and time synchronised data acquisition of various wave crest sensors during the 1997/1998 storm season at the Dutch Meetpost Noordwijk (MPN) measurement platform.Wave crest sensors involved are Baylor Wave Staff, THORN Wave Height Sensor (an upgrade of the EMI Laser), MAREX SO5 Wave Radar, SAAB Radar, Vlissingen Step Gauge and Marine 300 Step Gauge.A Directional Waverider Buoy, a SMART 800 GPS Buoy and a WAVEC Directional Buoy were deployed for obtaining directional wave information. For current and pressure information, an S4ADW Current Meter was deployed at 10 metres below mean sea level. Relevant additional fully operational sensors of the Dutch North Sea Monitoring Network (MNZ) are used as reference instruments, resulting in hydrological and meteorological data sets for validation and calibration purposes. To facilitate thorough data analysis and data assessment afterwards and the possibility to explain any flaws in the measurements due to the various measurement principles, the wave crest measurements are supported by digitised video frames twice a second. In this way, well known problems with regard to the instruments' response due to implicit filtering, influences of spray and positioning at the platform's structure can be traced back.The whole data acquisition project for the 1997/1998 storm season effectively started mid December 1997 and ended mid May 1998. By GSM telecommunication links to and from MPN, all sensors can be monitored on-line (and even worldwide) and service and maintenance visits can be scheduled most optimally.Following phases of this project may include a thorough data analysis and another measurement campaign including wave kinematics measurements. This will however be dependent on how representative the 1997/1998 storm season was compared to available long term observations.Data analysis and data assessment of the unique and very complete data set resulting from this project will facilitate access to old data sets for statistical purposes, since this intercomparison will link the individual sensors and allow for ways to compensate their different behaviour.",,,,,IEEE OCEANS Conference and Exhibition on Engineering for Sustainable Use of the Oceans (OCEANS 98)IEEE OCEANS Conference and Exhibition on Engineering for Sustainable Use of the Oceans (OCEANS 98),"SEP 28-OCT 01, 1998SEP 28-OCT 01, 1998",IEEE; IEEE Ocean Engn SocIEEE; IEEE Ocean Engn Soc,"NICE, FRANCENICE, FRANCE",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,0-7803-5045-6,,,,,,,,,"Oceanog Co Netherlands, OCN BV, NL-2701 AK Zoetermeer, Netherlands",Oceanog Co Netherlands,,,1998-01-01,WOS:000078340800350,,

Enabling a whole systems approach to local energy systems will provide new services and value streams, further driving direct benefits to the UK and enabling developments in the areas of system control, software development and aggregation services, establishing the UK as the world leader in this field.Levenmouth has been chosen as the initial test bed for the design study of a vector integration platform (VIP) to be designed through this project. Levenmouth has a diverse range of assets including a hydrogen microgrid, a deployed fleet of electric and hydrogen vehicles, a 7MW offshore wind turbine, an industry CHP plant and heat network. Due to the local demographic, significant levels of fuel poverty and low social mobility, the direct benefits of operating a smart local energy system will be tangibly realised.This project will develop the technical software specification for a VIP with the capabilities to control supply and demand assets across multiple energy vectors under a variety of different regulatory and market arrangements whilst returning a profit margin for both the owners and end users. Through working closely with the utility companies, local energy network owners and regulators, the VIP developed will provide a test bed for hardware testing and modelling policy on a local level with a significant focus attributed to testing public opinion and reaction to a de-carbonised energy system. Interactions with national models will be facilitated for accurate forecasting of multi-vector outcomes and to enable roll out of an evolved VIP across the UK and for exporting internationally.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,133795,,,,,,,,Ore Catapult Development Services Limited,Ore Catapult Development Services Limited,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:15375239,,

Dissemination will also be one of the main directions through the publication of journal papers and participation in conferences as well as organizing international conferences and seminars.The Marine Environment Group will study the marine environment that is important for the activities at sea. The main emphasis is given to mathematical and physical modelling of waves, currents and wind. The group aims at describing the variability of the mentioned phenomena in terms of probabilistic models applicable both to short term and to long term time scales. A particular concern is in the spatial distribution of the extreme values so as to define the areas that are subjected to the same extremes. The other main objective is to be able to predict wind and wave conditions by numerical models both in the hindcast and forecast mode. The performance of the models will be enhanced through assimilation schemes.The objective of the Dynamics and Hydrodynamics group includes the development of advanced computational tools, experimental investigation at model scale and full scale trials, and development of virtual reality models to allow enhanced visualization of the results. Work will concentrate in multi-body hydrodynamics in waves including slowly varying drift forces. Design of mooring systems and assessment of mooring damping. Modelling of wave energy devices and power take off solutions. Methods will be implemented to calculate extreme dynamic loads on floating wind turbines. It is planned to develop a coupled fluid-structure interaction (FSI) solver to investigate the hydroelastic responses of slender ships under slamming loads. Tests with self-running scaled models group will continue and the offline system identification algorithm will be improved. The current Ship Manoeuvring Simulator (SMS), will be upgraded into a Distributed Interactive Simulation (DIS) system. New algorithms are being developed for guidance and track planning and also for coordinated guidance of a group of autonomous vehicles.Ultimate strength is to be studied under different types of loads, fabrication-related imperfections; impact loads and age-related degradation. Fatigue Strength is based on the recent advances in computational mechanics leading to highly detailed fatigue and fracture analyses of ship and offshore structures. Impact Strength of metal and composite structures subjected to transverse impacts will be studied. Experimental, analytical and numerical research will be conducted on fibre-reinforced polymer materials for structural applications. Geometric Modelling of Marine Structures will implement a new prototype system able to support the fast digital prototyping of complete hull structures.The research on Maritime Traffic Safety and Human Factors will develop methods and tools for assessment and management of maritime traffic risks in coastal waters and port areas. Efficient methods for structural reliability assessment of intact and damaged ships and offshore and subsea structures will be developed. Methods for reliability and availability of ship systems, offshore wind farms and oil and gas production systems, including subsea systems and equipment. The general objective in the area of maritime transportation and port operations, considers also its integration in the wider scope of supply chain logistics. It will address port operations modelling, optimization of short sea shipping and economic and technologic aspects of Maritime Clusters.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,UIDP/00134/2020,,,,,,,,Centro de Engenharia e Tecnologia Naval e Oceanica,Centro de Engenharia e Tecnologia Naval e Oceanica,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:15473817,,

J,,,,,,,,,,,"Novel Acoustic Methods for Directly Monitoring Seabed Sediment Transport, Geohazards & Scour",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Awarded Grant,Sep 30 2020,2020,"This project will develop and field test novel acoustic methods for directly monitoring and understanding processes of seafloor sediment transport and scour, including around Offshore Wind Farms. These seabed processes can be a significant geohazard to offshore wind installations and their seabed power cables, telecommunication cables, oil and gas pipelines and other strategic seafloor infrastructure. The PhD will be based initially around a series of calibrated flume experiments to understand what determines the nature of acoustic signals emitted by seabed sediment transport or erosion processes. For example, it will determine how the power spectrum of radiated sound is affected by flow speed, bedload transport rates and intensity of grain collisions, grain sizes present (sand or mid), and presence and nature of dense near bed layers (e.g. layers of saltating grains or sheet-flow). These laboratory experiment (supervised by Simmons in Hull) will help to interpret acoustic field data to better monitor and understand seabed sediment transport. Hydrophone and/or ADCP data will then be used to monitor processes of sediment transport and seabed scour near Offshore Wind Facilities in the N. Sea. This work will use hydrophone data sets that are already acquired by Neasham in Newcastle. The PhD will finally analyse a series of major field data sets involving hydrophone records of active sediment transport processes. They will include major new field data sets offshore West Africa, California and British Columbia. This work will show how hydrophones can be used to understand hazardous seabed flows, and processes of sediment transport and seabed scour, which may underpin future global seabed listening networks. The aim here is to further test acoustic methods needed to quantify sediment transport around Offshore Wind Facilities, and make use of existing opportunities provided by two NERC funded projects worth over £3.2 Million. This scale of funding is simply not available through the CDT itself (where budgets for single projects are less than £20k at most). This project will also allow the student to take part in two major oceanographic cruises, which will use a wide range of seabed surveying and monitoring tool, thus providing outstanding field training. They are an outstanding training opportunity. It will also include training via analysis of hydrophone data from locations near Offshore Wind Farms in the North Sea.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,2444010,,,,,,,,Durham University,,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:15326635,,

The PI's research is focused on mathematical approaches to this problem. This research is designed to help make improvements to several stages of the materials process chain, from construction of phase diagrams to determination of growth rates and texture optimization. Her work features the interplay of modeling, simulation and analysis tools involving partial differential equations and stochastic processes. A combination of techniques from optimization, statistics and numerical analysis help this project substantially contribute to some of the field's long-standing challenges. The PI's plans include the creation of a mesoscopic theory of microstructure evolution which is focused on traditionally neglected disappearance events. Novel high-accuracy tools for multicomponent phase diagram calculation are achieved by fully utilizing modern sampling and constrained optimization techniques. Through a network of already established and newly formed collaborations with engineers in the US and abroad, the PI plans a comprehensive analysis of the impact of micro- and mesoscopic parameters on macroscopic materials properties. The Modeling Days conference organized by the PI and run together with the K-12 Mathematics Day workshop, brings students and senior researchers working in the field closer together and provides a unique career forum and networking opportunity for students from K-12 to postgraduate level, and helps to recruit and retain a talented workforce. Microstructure degradation of components exposed to high temperature and high pressure has been linked to failure of components such as used in petrochemical plants, oil and gas transmission pipelines, offshore structures, ships, pharmaceutical plants, food processing equipment, and gas turbine engine components. The PI's research provides cost-effective solutions for predicting and preventing failure of materials due to environmental factors. This work has a direct impact on many practically important areas by advancing the synthesis of novel smart materials. These are highly sophisticated materials which possess very specific sets of properties targeted to particular applications. Close collaboration between mathematical and engineering communities on the global scale fostered by this project is crucial for accelerating the design and deployment of such materials. The project provides an unparalleled opportunity for involving students from high school to graduate level in a wide array of vertically-integrated research and educational activities focused on mathematical modeling and analysis of real-life systems. Such activities include short-term and long-term research projects, internships with industry, workshops and meetings with top scientists in the field. Special effort in the project is dedicated to the recruitment of women and minorities into STEM-related fields and outreach activities aimed at showcasing mathematics as a powerful tool for discovery.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,1056821,,,,,,,,George Mason University,,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:13811426,,

The results of this survey were compared to a more limited survey conducted circa 1970 and to earlier, less detailed accounts. Our survey approximately doubles the known area of reef and unconsolidated shelly substrate in the bay system.Certain components of the Galveston Bay reef system have persisted throughout recorded time; others have exhibited substantial malleability, changing position and shape in response to natural and man-made changes in the bay system. Regional subsidence has resulted in an increase in water depth over the reefs, thus reducing the acreage intertidally and subaerially exposed, and areas of high subsidence have suffered reef attrition due to siltation. Channelization, dike construction, and the disappearance of major barrier reef have substantially changed bay circulation patterns. As a consequence, the equilibrium that once existed between the reefs and bay circulation has been modified, resulting in loss or attrition of a number of reefs in areas of lowered salinity and the accretion of reefs parallel to the new isohaline structure of the bay. Thus, some reefs are no longer optimally located for continued high productivity; many areas of low reef coverage would now support productive reef if substrate became available. In optimal areas, reefs more than doubled in size in 20 yr.No evidence was found to suggest that the oyster fishery had contributed to reef attrition, however leasing may have encouraged reef accretion. Artificial reefs did no worse or better than their natural nearby counterparts, indicating siting as the overriding concern for successful artificial reef emplacement. The Houston Ship Channel has extended the isohalines upestuary to the great benefit of oyster populations and the oyster fishery. Over 1000 hectares of reef have developed along this channel, a substantial fraction of which exists between the channel edge and the crest of the parallel-trending spoil banks. Both a channel and a spoil bank are required for development of reef along channels. Channels in which spoil was placed on only one side always have reef development predominately or exclusively on that side.",,,,,,,,,30,0,0,0,16,1,38,,,0730-8000,,,,,,,,,,,"TEXAS A&M UNIV,DEPT OCEANOG,COLLEGE STN,TX 77843",,,,1995-12-01,WOS:A1995TT36500023,,

The method involved surrounding an area of oyster reef with a buried net at low tide, allowing the water level to rise, raising the net at high tide to trap motile organisms, allowing the water to recede, and collecting the entrapped nekton. Natural and artificially constructed reefs were sampled, and efficiency (mark-recapture) studies were performed to evaluate the method. The advantages of this method are: (1) the habitat in the area to be sampled receives minimal damage; (2) the size and shape of the net system are flexible and can be adapted to fit a variety of habitats; (3) no permanent structures, other than a shallow perimeter trench, are present to act as attractants; and (4) it is relatively inexpensive to purchase and maintain gear. One disadvantage to the method is that it is very labor intensive, typically using three to five people. This method proved more efficient on natural reefs than artificial reefs, and the return rate was slightly better for Fundulus heteroclitus than for Palaemonetes spp. Seventeen decapod and 24 fish taxa were collected from initial spring, summer, and fall 1995 sampling.",,,,,,,,,33,0,0,0,20,0,38,,,0730-8000,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1996-12-01,WOS:A1996WB85200034,,

As well as protecting the local coastline, they enhance surfing possibilities and/or increase the environmental value of the area where they are situated. Multifunctional artificial reefs (MFARs) have some promising new aspects, too: first, they provide an unimpaired visual amenity, and second, they can offer tourist and economic benefits by improving the surfing conditions. Regarding the functionality of an MFAR, much research has been carried out on surfability, i.e. whether a wave is good for surfers. However, no research has yet been done on the influence of the submergence and the length of the reef slope on the breaker type, even though this is important for the design of the reef in terms of surfability. A preliminary design was achieved step by step, making use of the theory and state of the art of multifunctional artificial reefs (Voorde et al. 2009a, 2009b). This reef geometry was then used as an initial design in physical and numerical tests. These were performed to ascertain the capacity of a multifunctional reef to serve as a submerged breakwater and so protect the local coastline of Leirosa, Portugal, and improve the local surfing possibilities. This paper describes the numerical study conducted to analyze the influences of the main relevant parameters in the vertical plane, namely: the height, the submergence, and the length and slope of the reef.

Blue Ocean Ltd. created a 30.65 km(2) AR area covered by oysters in the eastern part of Laizhou Bay, Bohai Sea. It is important for the government and investors to understand and assess the current status of the AR ecosystem compared to the system status before AR deployment. We provide that assessment, including trophic interactions, energy flows, keystone species, ecosystem properties and fishing impacts, through a steady-state trophic flow model (Ecopath with Ecosim). The model estimated values of 4721.2 and 4697.276 t km(-2) yr(-1) for total system throughput and 534.74 and -519.9 t km(-2) yr(-1) for net system production before and after AR deployment, respectively. After AR deployment, sea cucumber and oyster showed the same trophic level (TL = 2.0) while veined whelk Rapana venosa had TL = 3.0. The mean TL of catches was 2.484 after AR deployment and the primary production required to support fisheries (PPR) was 1104 t km(-2). Detritus production dominated over primary production and represented 73.82% (2530.82 t km(-2)) of total primary production required. The sea cucumber showed the lowest PPR/catch value (5.6) among functional groups, indicating that fishing catch biomasses were close to primary production values. The total primary production to total respiration and total primary production to total biomass ratios showed higher system maturity after AR deployment. The trophic flow diagram showed 1 grazing and 2 detritus food chains. Pelagic and bottom fish and different benthic organisms, including large crustaceans and zoobenthos, were the dominant community before AR deployment.

A survey was conducted among recreational users of the bay of Saint-Brieuc, where an offshore wind farm is currently planned. The goal is to identify the preferences of the bay's users with respect to various compensation possibilities: monetary compensation, investment in publicly owned assets, or the ecological restoration. Two multinomial logit (MNL) models and a latent class (LC) model are used to explore the preferences and some sources of heterogeneity within the community. The results of this study show that form of compensation is an important determinant of preferences and has an effect on the acceptability towards the compensation principle. More precisely, results shows that compensation is better accepted if it obeys the principle of strong sustainability, which includes ecological restoration for the gain of the population as a whole and which excludes monetary transactions, associated with the bribe effect. The study also highlights the naturalists' specific attitude for who compensation should be determined within a regulatory framework, one which imposes compensatory measures related to objectively determined ecological impacts.

This threat deals particularly, in short and medium terms, with offshore or coastal fish stock (Worms et al. 2006; Cury 2008).In order to address alimentary and socio-cultural food issues, to act on preserving and developing resources, the crisis manager generally focuses on two fundamental principles: (1) to act on preserving the species by managing fishing efforts and limiting catches (an example of management by the policy of TAC and quotas fishing); (2) to impact the environment by developing, for example, marine ranching and by expanding artificial coastal habitats with artificial reefs. In light of their systematic developmental approach (FAO 1995), we prefer to use the term: artificial habitats (or AH). Based on the Japanese experience in the field of artificial habitats, and on a feasibility study in the town of Saint-Len (Reunion Island), we will study the methodology and planning proposals for implementing an ICAM strategy that is essential to the success of the development of fishery facilities (Denis 2001; Henocque, Lecons et futur de la gestion integree des zones cotieres dans le monde, VertigO - La revue en sciences de lenvironnement 2006).Our contribution will be based on a geo-socio-systemic approach pertaining to artificial habitats in the coastal area.

The biogeochemical response of organic matter and drill cuttings additions resembled each other, in both cases resulting in enhanced sediment-water fluxes of oxygen, nitrate and ammonium, and reduced concentration of oxygen in sediment pore water. This finding indicated degradation of an organic compound in the water-based drill cuttings. Regarding the biological response, benthic community composition was significantly different for all treatment factors, evidenced by PERMANOVA. Abundance and biomass were reduced in boxes without addition of organic matter, probably as a response to starvation, while abundance and taxa richness were reduced in boxes with drill cuttings.

This highly productive system has yielded annual fishery landings of >453.6 x 10(6) kg (1 billion pounds) since 1969. The Louisiana ecosystem has been heavily exploited and significantly altered over the years to meet the demands for coastal development, seafood production, navigation, oil exploration, flood control, and other social, economic, and industrial activities. While not all impacts can be viewed as detrimental to fisheries or their habitat, some of these habitat impacts have contributed to significant ecological problems such as saltwater intrusion, loss of coastal wetlands, and development of vast area of hypoxia along the coast. Management strategies to deal with some of these problems propose directed manipulations of the coastal environments to stop or reduce rates of degradation. Over the past 46 years, fisheries yields from Louisiana waters have remained strong. Although quantitative data are lacking to examine more than a few decades of environmental changes, an analysis of fishery-independent trends for selected inshore species of nekton over a recent 21-yr period suggests that many species have been remarkably resilient to significant changes in their habitats and pressures from exploitation. Over a longer period (60 yr), more significant changes to inshore demersal trawl assemblages are apparent, but data are lacking to conclusively identify their causes or quantitatively document the magnitude of change. We review some of the major changes that have occurred in habitat believed to be essential to fishes and review other factors likely to be significant in structuring fish populations. Given the significant number of environmental impacts affecting the system, we also discuss potential reasons why more dramatic changes in nearshore and estuarine fish populations of coastal Louisiana are not apparent.",,,,,"3rd Annual Conference on Fisheries, Habitat, and Pollution3rd Annual Conference on Fisheries, Habitat, and Pollution","NOV 06-08, 1997NOV 06-08, 1997","Natl Marine Fisheries Serv; NOAA, Coastal Serv Ctr; LLC; Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commiss; S Carolina Sea Grant Consortium; S Carolina Dept Nat Resources; Univ S Carolina, Belle W Brauch Inst Marine Biol & Costal Res; TerrAqua Environm Sci & PolicyNatl Marine Fisheries Serv; NOAA, Coastal Serv Ctr; LLC; Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commiss; S Carolina Sea Grant Consortium; S Carolina Dept Nat Resources; Univ S Carolina, Belle W Brauch Inst Marine Biol & Costal Res; TerrAqua Environm Sci & Policy","CHARLESTON, SCCHARLESTON, SC",144,3,0,0,109,1,189,,,1051-0761,1939-5582,,,,,,,,,,"Louisiana Univ Marine Consortium, Chauvin, LA 70344 USALouisiana State Univ, CCEER, Coastal Fisheries Inst, Baton Rouge, LA 70803 USALouisiana State Univ, Dept Oceanog & Coastal Sci, Baton Rouge, LA 70803 USALouisiana Dept Wildlife & Fisheries, Marine Fisheries Div, Baton Rouge, LA 70898 USA",Louisiana Univ Marine ConsortiumLouisiana Dept Wildlife & Fisheries,,,2000-04-01,WOS:000086008300004,,

Being attracted to hard substrates, fish schools usually aggregate around the jackets or legs of the platforms where they are afforded some protection from predators and benefit from high concentrations of prey and smaller organisms foraging in the area. However, even though higher fish densities are reported near the structures, behavior and movements of fish schools around the platforms have not yet been properly investigated.In such context, this chapter investigates the diurnal spatial movements of schooling fish around three gas extraction platforms placed in the north-central Adriatic Sea to improve knowledge on how these structures influence the surrounding fish assemblage.Hydroacoustic multibeam echosounder surveys were conducted for 1 year at dawn, noon, and dusk. Results highlighted the variation in fish biomass around the platforms related to the time of the day and distance from the structure. Recognizing a constant attraction of fish to the platforms during daylight hours (i.e., dawn to dusk), fish biomass was greater near the gas platforms, especially at dusk. Oppositely, variation in the morphometric features of fish schools occurred during the daytime only for the school volume associated with platforms at deeper depths. Complementary information on the fish assemblages associated with the gas platforms derived from fishing surveys allowed a better understanding of the diurnal behavior of fish schools around the structures.",,,,,Symposium on Marine Artificial Reef Research and Development: Integrating Fisheries Management ObjectivesSymposium on Marine Artificial Reef Research and Development: Integrating Fisheries Management Objectives,"AUG 22-23, 2017AUG 22-23, 2017",,"Tampa, FLTampa, FL",1,0,0,0,0,0,1,,,0892-2284,,978-1-934874-51-6,,,,,,,,,"CNR, Inst Marine Sci, Largo Fiera Pesca 1, I-60125 Ancona, Italy",,,,2019-02-13,WOS:000456750700002,,

We combined a Bayesian Belief Network with a Geographical Information System (GIS) for the spatially explicit quantification of the ecological and economic risks of spatial management options. As an example we assessed the German exclusive economic zone (EEZ) in the North Sea to determine the potential effects of 2 scenarios on the vulnerability of plaice Pleuronectes platessa to fishing, fishing fleets and their revenues. In the first scenario we simulated a shift in plaice distribution due to changes in bottom temperatures to assess spatial management options. Then we imitated an expansion of offshore wind energy development with an associated reallocation of international fishing effort to assess the ecological and economic consequences. We predicted that an increase of 0.5 degrees C in the average bottom temperature would require a significant reduction in fishing effort to maintain the current relative level of the vulnerability of plaice to fishing. The likely consequences of the second scenario were a homogenous increase in plaice catches around the areas closed for fishing, together with a decrease in the vulnerability of plaice to fishing within 17% of the study area. Our results showed the great potential of this framework to integrate the spatially explicit assessment of the economic and ecological risks of spatial management options.

This hypothesis was tested using experimental exclusion cages and partial cages at two sites at two distances at two different rocky reefs. Undisturbed uncaged assemblages of macrofauna close to the rocky reefs were generally different from those in the partial cages and full cages. However, caging artifacts could not be detected and there were no strong correlations between the macrofauna and the proportions of different grain size and organic content. The structure of the macrofaunal assemblages close to the rocky reefs was, nevertheless, different from those far from the reefs and the sediments were finer far from than close to the rocky reefs. The results indicated that factors other than predation or grain size caused the differences in the macrofauna. For the spatial and temporal scales used in this study, it was clear that, although predation maybe intense, on its own it cannot explain the differences in the structure of the assemblages close and far from rocky reefs.

An Ecopath with Ecosim model was developed to simulate the ecosystem impacts of Reef Fish Fishery Management Plan Amendment 30B (which aims to rebuild Gag Mycteroperca microlepis) and Amendment 31 (which reduces effort in the longline fishery). We also evaluated the impact of a hypothetical increase in the exploitation of baitfish and future changes to phytoplankton productivity. The model predicted that rebuilding Gag will cause the biomass of Black Sea Bass Centropristis striata to be 20% lower than it is now and those of Black Grouper M. bonaci, King Mackerel Scomberomorus cavalla, and other shallow-water groupers to be 5-10% lower. Reducing effort in the longline fishery will lead to biomass declines for Black Sea Bass (13%) and Vermilion Snapper Rhomboplites aurorubens (7%). Harvesting baitfish at historically high levels caused the biomass of Red Snapper Lutjanus campechanus, Vermilion Snapper, Greater Amberjack Seriola dumerili, King Mackerel, and numerous species of dolphins and seabirds to be 5-12% lower after 20 years, while biomass increased for species whose diet consists of benthic-associated prey.

This exploration is hampered by the lack of high band width communications. Radio waves do not propagate in sea water, and acoustic communication systems operate at relatively low bandwidth. Recent developments in blue/green semiconductor light sources suggest an alternative technology path to high bandwidth underwater optical communications. Intellectual Merit: The technical challenge of this proposal is to understand how the propagation of light underwater impacts optical communication system design and to develop methodologies to compute accurate communication link budgets for different ocean water conditions. To accomplish this, underwater optical communication systems will be built and tested in different water conditions. Understanding the role of absorption and scattering on the attenuation and dispersion of the signal is especially important to quantify. The scattering of light underwater also places special requirements on the dynamic range of the receiver, as well as the collection optics and pointing requirements. In addition to underwater optical communication links, short range optical wireless links integrated with solid state lighting systems and autonomous robotic vehicles will be considered. Broader Impact: High bandwidth underwater communications would be enabling for many scientific disciplines that investigate the ocean environment. Presently there is a proliferation of research that relies on autonomous underwater vehicles for data collection, and increasing numbers of people and robots work underwater, performing surveys, examining cables and pipelines, or working on oil rigs. Working underwater is dangerous and difficult and is consistently hampered by poor communications.

Like a vehicleparking sensor, the SafeSurround concept aims to provide audio and visual alarms to warnships’ officers of collision hazards. However, the technical challenges to achieve this aremuch greater than for a vehicle parking sensor, when the vehicle is a 90m-long vessel beingbuffeted by waves.The need for a hazard detection system has been raised by the Marine Safety Forum as aresult of an increasing number of vessel collisions with offshore oil installations. This is partlybecause increased size and power of support vessels increases their capability to causedamage, and also because inexperienced crews are failing to adhere to safety procedures andguidance. In 2005 a support vessel collided with the Mumbai High North processing platform,causing a fire that resulted in 22 deaths, the destruction of the platform and $195m in lostrevenue and clean-up costs.Guidance Marine Ltd (GML) is the leading developer and supplier of local position referencesensors for Dynamic Positioning (DP) and other vessel control systems. GML’s laser andradar sensors can be integrated by all major DP manufacturers and are used on a daily basisby most Offshore and Platform Supply Vessel operators. GML’s products accurately measurethe relative position of the target in relation to the sensor to enable the vessel to hold positionand operate safely in close proximity to an installation.SafeSurround is envisaged as the final piece of the DP jigsaw, giving close-range (<300m)relative position information for hazard detection to work alongside laser and microwave DPsensors. The ultimate goal is to integrate SafeSurround into DP systems, but first the conceptmust be proven as a stand-alone system. The project will test the positioning and configurationof sensors required to protect a vessel from collisions, in a range of environments fromharbours to oil rigs to the open sea.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,710726,,,,,,,,Guidance Marine Limited,Guidance Marine Limited,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:15365393,,

This study assesses the basic biology and ecology of lionfish in the Mediterranean, examining morphometrics, reproduction and diet as well as population structure and distribution. The population density of lionfish has increased dramatically in Cyprus since the first sighting in late 2012; by 2018 aggregations of up to 70 lionfish were found on rocky grounds with complex reefs and artificial reefs in depths of 0-50 m. Lionfish in Cyprus become mature within a year, and adults are capable of spawning year-round, with peak spawning in summer when the sea-surface temperature reaches 28.4 degrees C. The Cypriot lionfish grow faster and bigger than in their native range, and females are more common than males. Lionfish are generalist predators in these waters, as also found in their native range, consuming a range of teleost and crustacean prey, some of which are of high economic value (e.g., Spicara smaris and Sparisoma cretense) or have an important role in local trophic webs (e.g., Chromis chromis). Overall, the reproductive patterns, the presence of juveniles and adults throughout the year, the rapid growth rates and the generalist diet indicate that lionfish are thriving and are now already well established in the region and could potentially become the serious nuisance that they are in their temperate and tropical western Atlantic-invasive range.",,,,,,,,,40,0,0,0,27,0,41,,,0022-1112,1095-8649,,,,,,,,,,"Marine & Environm Res MER Lab, CY-4533 Limassol, CyprusUniv Cyprus, Dept Biol Sci, Nicosia, CyprusUniv Plymouth, Sch Biol & Marine Sci, Plymouth, Devon, EnglandEnalia Physis Environm Res Ctr, Nicosia, CyprusUniv Cyprus, KIOS Res & Innovat Ctr Excellence, Nicosia, CyprusIsrael Oceanog & Limnol Res, Natl Inst Oceanog, Haifa, Israel",Marine & Environm Res MER LabEnalia Physis Environm Res Ctr,,,2020-05-05,WOS:000527888400001,32249927,

Both local marine ecology and political climate play a role in decommissioning offshore oil production platforms. Compared to the relatively supportive political climate in the Gulf of Mexico for rigs-to-reefs programs, conflicting social values among stakeholders in Southern California increases the need for understanding ecological impacts of various decommissioning alternatives (which range from total removal to allowing some or all of platform structure to remain in the ocean). Additional scientific needs in the decommissioning process include further assessment of platform habitat quality, estimation of regional impacts of decommissioning alternatives to marine populations, and determination of biological effects of any residual contaminants. The principal management need is a ranking of environmental priorities (e.g. species-of-interest and marine habitats). Because considerable numbers of economically important species reside near oil platforms, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Fisheries should consider the consequences of decommissioning alternatives in their overall management plans. Management strategies could include designating reefed platforms as marine protected areas. The overarching conclusion from both ecological and political perspectives is that decommissioning decisions should be made on a case-by-case basis. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

Recruitment refers to the number of individuals arriving onshore from pelagic larval habitat. Documenting recruitment at new sites may provide insight into coastwide patterns, providing resolution to competing hypotheses that describe why annual recruitment varies. However, recruitment can be patchy along the coast, requiring exploratory research to identify recruitment sites before beginning long-term monitoring. The objective of this study is to provide the first description of the timing and abundance of nearshore juvenile rockfish entering kelp beds in Trinidad Bay. Fish were sampled weekly over the summers of 2010 and 2011 with two artificial reefs, Standard Monitoring Units for the Recruitment of Fishes (SMURFs). The number of fish sampled varied annually, averaging 3,464 (n = 2, SD = 315) fish sampled per SMURF in 2010 and 447 (n = 2, SD = 8) sampled per SMURF in 2011. Of the fish sampled, 46% and 23% were juvenile Black Rockfish S. melanops in 2010 and 2011, respectively. The order in which species arrived onshore was consistent between the years and matched the order of parturition among species. We conclude Trinidad Bay would be a valuable site for long-term monitoring of rockfish recruitment in northern California and discuss our observations within the context of habitat selection, larval transport, and open-ocean survival.Received August 25, 2013; accepted November 6, 2013",,,,,,,,,5,0,0,0,5,0,8,,,0002-8487,1548-8659,,,,,,,,,,"Humboldt State Univ, Dept Fisheries Biol, Arcata, CA 95521 USA",,,,2014-05-13,WOS:000333882800021,,

Characteristics examined included sex ratio, peak spawning season, batch fecundity of females (1 x 10(6) oocytes), fork length (FL, mm) at maturity, and batch fecundity as a function of FL or weight (i.e., Delta 1 x 10(6) oocytes = Delta FL). These characteristics were investigated to build a foundational understanding of an understudied region of the Gulf and a relatively new artificial reef habitat. Reef sites managed by the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department Artificial Reef Program were sampled for 1 year, yielding 112 individuals. The sex ratio was 1:1 males to females but varied among sample sites, suggesting that an unidentified factor may have influenced aggregations of males and females. Spawning season was similar in other regions of the Gulf of Mexico (i.e., between June and August with a peak in July).

Changes in compressive strength, composition, and coverage of sessile biota species, as well as in trace element concentration of the block surface and in sessile biota from four taxonomic groups, were determined as a function of time at sea and block type. Compressive strength clearly increased with time in all types to values well above the minimal strength considered necessary for stability of the blocks at sea. Moreover, the 40% and 60% CFA blocks were 1.5 times stronger than the 0% and 80% ones. Main sessile taxa recorded were filamentous green algae, bryozoa, barnacles, serpulid polychaeta, hydrozoa, and bivalves. Number of species settled and biotic coverage varied among block side and seasonally, but did not differ significantly between block types. The initial heavy metal composition (Hg, Cd, Pb, Cu, Zn, Cr, Mn, Fe, Al) of the block material was directly proportional to the CFA percentage. At the end of the study, Pb had decreased in all types, Cd in the 60% CFA block, and Fe and Al in the 40% and 60% blocks, while Mn had increased in the blocks with 0'% and 80% CFA. After 21 months at sea, the only detectable change was a decrease in Pb concentration in all types, indicating that changes may be due to long-term processes. Trace metal levels (Hg, Cd, Zn, Mn, Cu, Fe, and Al) were measured in the sessile biota (hydrozoa, polychaeta, and bivalvia). In most cases, no dependence was found between metal levels and time at sea or CFA content of the blocks. In the hydroid, metal concentration even decreased over time.(C) 2002 International Council for the Exploration of the Sea. Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.

The modules were arranged in three configurations, each in triplicate: (1) solitary modules (1 m(3)), (2) side-by-side modules (2 m(3)) and (3) modules forming a triangle (3 m(3)). The surrounding ichthyofauna were sampled in two periods of the year (dry: September 2009 and October 2010; rainy: April 2010 and April 2011) with gillnets to record the richness, species diversity, number of individuals and biomass per volume unit. The total mean values of richness, diversity, number of individuals and biomass did not differ significantly among the reef volumes. However, when these variables were analyzed per standardized volume unit, there was an increase in these variables with the increase in reef volume, considering all the transient ichthyofauna as well as the most representative families, Ariidae and Sciaenidae. A non-metric multidimensional scaling ordination analysis revealed differences in the composition of the ichthyofauna between the sampling periods, dominated by Sciaenidae (Stellifer rastrifer, Paralonchurus brasiliensis, Larimus breviceps and Cynoscion virescens) in the dry period and by Ariidae (Aspistor luniscutis) and Carcharinidae (Rhizoprionodon porosus) in the rainy period. The results suggest that the increase in module size from 1 to 3 m(3) may result in slight alterations in the community descriptors, with a decrease in the relative values of richness, diversity and density per standardized volume unit. Furthermore, the effects of the seasonal flow of the Paraiba do Sul River may overlap the effects of reef configuration, mainly in the rainy period with higher flow. The implementation of several dispersed 1 m(3) modules seems to be the most favorable configuration to attract transient ichthyofauna, especially Ariidae and Sciaenidae, on the northern coast of the state of Rio de Janeiro.

The Chao Phraya delta in Thailand is the target area of this research. This region includes many artificial structures in the east coast and around the river mouth, and many abandoned shrimp farms in the west coast. Although the target area is exposed to erosion, there is no fundamental counterplan to this problem at present.In the previous research, we analyzed satellite data obtained from 1987 to 2000 and solved a coastal environment system at the target area. The causes of coastal erosion are mangrove deforestation, abandoned shrimp farms, subsidence, soil runoff, and sea level rise, all of which are closely interrelated with each other. We emphasized the problem of coastal erosion, and explicated the coastal environment from the viewpoint of the relationships between coastal erosion and its various causes.In this research, we performed the time series analysis with both satellite data and old aerial photographs, and indicated the coastal changes in over a period of more than half a century. Then we investigated the more reliable cause of coastal erosion and suggested the coastal management for future environmental.We also established a method of synergy use of both aerial photographs and recent satellite data. Then we revealed a change in the coastline over half a century. Moreover, by comparison between change of coastline and history of human activities, we could explain the more detailed causes of coastline changes. Finally as the result of this research, we discussed the direction of coastal management strategy around the Chao Praya river mouth, for example, the priority of how to process wasted closed water areas and how to prevent erosion of the coastline.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,15404026,,,,,,,,The University of Tokyo,,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:14811137,,

Aquaculture-based enhancement includes stock enhancement, restocking, and sea ranching. Developments in aquaculture techniques, tagging, genetics, modelling and ecology have underpinned growth in this field in the 21st century, particularly in the context of marine recreational fisheries. Marine enhancement practice has now matured to the point that quantitative tools are frequently applied before any fish or shellfish are released into the natural environment, and pilot-scale enhancement scenarios and release strategies are evaluated before full implementation. Social and economic studies are also increasingly important components of this assessment. Here, several case studies from diverse geographic areas exemplify the union of aquaculture technology, quantitative modelling, social science, physiology and ecology to estimate enhancement potential, improve enhancement strategies, assess enhancement outcomes, and support adaptive management. Integrating aquaculture-based enhancement with habitat enhancement presents a remarkable opportunity for future research and development, and offers the potential to further increase the opportunities and associated socio-economic benefits that are available to a broad range of fisheries stakeholders.

There is a clear need for developing new technologies that will help cut our electricity bills whilst building a UK manufacturing industry. Iberdrola has been developing an innovative floating foundation concept, TLPWIND, during the last four years to help reduce the costs of electricity from OW. The floating foundation will be moored to the seabed using a tensioned cable system that will restrict its motion almost entirely. It’s main dimensions and steel weight have been carefully optimised and its fabrication costs minimised. The TLPWIND concept enables more efficient and reduced cost transportation and installation (“T&I”) with the wind turbine being assembled onshore, in a controlled environment. This heavily reduces offshore operations and the use of expensive heavy installation vessels, and thus T&I costs. This approach is intended to de-risk offshore wind projects, particularly in the view of Insurers and Financiers, and consequently increase investor confidence and commitment to OW projects. This project aims to adapt this semi-mature concept to UK site conditions (50-60m plus) and help reduce overall LCOE.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,101969,,,,,,,,Iberdrola Engineering and Construction UK Limited,,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:15387591,,

The affinity of Red Snapper for artificial and natural reefs is well established; however, this affinity appears to vary with age. We used a multigear survey that targeted all age-classes of Red Snapper to determine the distribution by age-class on artificial reefs, natural reefs, and unconsolidated mud-sand bottom across the shallow-water (<100 m) portion of the north-central Gulf of Mexico continental shelf. Bottom trawl, remotely operated vehicle (video), vertical longline, and bottom longline surveys were conducted in randomly selected 2-kmx2-km grids that were previously surveyed with side-scan sonar to yield a synoptic understanding of habitat use by age-class. Zero- and 1-year-old Red Snapper (collected from trawls) were found primarily in shallow water (similar to 20-40m deep) on unconsolidated muddy bottom in the northwestern portion of the survey area. Vertical longline catch per unit effort was highest at artificial reef sites, followed by natural reef sites and lastly sites with unstructured bottom. The vertical longline surveys collected 2-8-year-old Red Snapper near artificial and natural reefs, yet the mean age and size of these fish did not differ between the two habitats. Older Red Snapper (5-42years old) were collected on bottom longlines, away from reef structures on unstructured bottom throughout all depth strata. Our results demonstrate ontogenetic changes in habitat use for Red Snapper (from unstructured bottom areas to artificial or natural reefs and back to unstructured bottom areas), but unlike the results from previous studies they do not show a strong trend toward increases in the prevalence of older Red Snapper with increasing depth.",,,,,,,,,20,0,0,0,17,0,26,,,0002-8487,1548-8659,,,,,,,,,,"Univ S Alabama, Dept Marine Sci, 5871 USA Dr North,LSC B,Room 25, Mobile, AL 36688 USADauphin Isl Sea Lab, 101 Bienville Blvd, Dauphin Isl, AL 36528 USAMississippi State Univ, Coastal Res & Extens Ctr, 1815 Popps Ferry Rd, Biloxi, MS 39532 USA",,,,2018-12-28,WOS:000444682900002,,

Technologies for the conversion of Marine Energy (ME) into electricity are now ready for full-scale deployment in farms of devices, making the final step from demonstration to operability and commercial exploitation. Although marine energy is more abundant along the Atlantic and Nordic European coasts, significant resources are also available in the Mediterranean Sea, opening up new perspectives for sustainable energy production in sensitive coastal areas and for the economic development of Southern Europe. The implementation of ME converters in the Mediterranean is in fact liable to induce significant technological advancements leading to product innovation, due to the local low energy levels which impose more restrictive constraints on device efficiency and environmental compatibility. In addition, the milder climate allows the testing of concepts and prototypes in the natural environment at more affordable costs, lowering capital risks for new and innovative small and medium enterprises. Research institutions and industrial players in Mediterranean countries have already taken up the challenge, despite the numerous limiting factors that still need to be removed. In particular, the ME sector adds up to the many different traditional maritime activities and to the new ocean-related industries that are developing, potentially exacerbating the competition for the use of marine space in the Mediterranean region and threatening its environmental status. The ME sector needs therefore to design suitable instruments to involve all the relevant stakeholders in a participative public debate as to how to best manage the maritime space. As the prospective sea use patterns are rapidly changing, an adequate international legal and policy framework needs to be designed for the coherent management of sea space, and Marine Spatial Planning needs to be finally implemented by EU Member States also in the Mediterranean area. To this end, the creation of transnational clusters of stakeholders is expected be an effective catalyzer, especially as they can foster the exchange of knowledge and best practices both across European countries and between the North and the South shore of the Mediterranean basin.",,,,,,,,,22,0,0,0,1,0,22,,,2296-598X,,,,,,,,,,,"Natl Agcy New Technol Energy & Sustainable Econ D, Rome, ItalyUniv Siena, Dept Phys Sci Earth & Environm, Siena, Italy",,,,2018-11-12,WOS:000448625300001,,

Fleece-like microstructure attracted especially mussel larvae, however, most settled individuals lost attachment on this type of microstructure with increasing size during the time of experiment. Substrates with thick filaments and long and fixed appendices were less attractive to larvae but provided a better foothold for juvenile mussels as shown by the results of the dislodgement trials. In addition these appendices of substrates could interweave with the mussels, building up a resistant mussel/substrate conglomerate. Our results show that a mussel byssus apparatus can withstand harsh conditions, if suitable substrates are deployed. Depending on cultivation aims (seed or market sized mussels) and cultivation method (one or two step cultivation), different collector types for larval attraction, good foothold and interweaving abilities or collectors combining these properties should be developed and applied. The study suggests that substrates need to be very precisely tailored according to the major environmental conditions. Furthermore, the results imply that a one size fits all substrate may not be the most culture-effective approach, but, in the contrary, substrates need to be changed and modified according to the size of the mussel as they go through their different life cycle stages.

Here, the installation of huge offshore wind parks within the near future is planned. The aim was to model environmental effects of altered sea-use patterns on marine biota. Indicators of ecological integrity were used to assess altering conditions and possible ecosystem shifts ranging from systems' degradations to the development of highly productive and diverse artificial reef systems.

Access to this type of renewable energy not only contributes to society's energy supply but also helps to save energy and reduce environmental pollution. Although some works have reviewed applications of the Multi-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) model in wind power plant site selection, little research has focused on this problem in a fuzzy environment. This is the reason why a hybrid Fuzzy Analytic Hierarchy Process (FAHP) and The Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) are developed for wind power plant site selection in Vietnam. In the first stages of this research, an FAHP model is proposed for determining the weight of each potential location for building a wind power plant, based on qualitative and quantitative factors. A TOPSIS is applied for ranking all potential alternatives in the final stage. The authors collected data from seven locations, which have good conditions for investment in a wind power plant.

Such IoT nodes require low device cost, and thus low sub-component costs for sensing elements, processing circuits, communications, and power. In addition, they are power constrained, requiring minimal energy consumption during sensor data collection, processing, and transmission. Integrating low-cost and low-power components into a single size-limited device becomes a substantial challenge using conventional semiconductor fabrication materials and processes. This SBIR Phase II project will use a novel System-on-Foil approach that patterns efficient silicon circuitry directly into a novel flexible silicon substrate, alongside low-cost printed electronics. This approach enables the integration of all core IoT elements, including microprocessors, sensors, antennas, interconnects, and power supplies, making robust systems with applications in condition monitoring for civil infrastructure, human health monitoring, automotive, grid battery management, wind turbines, aerospace, and industrial equipment.<br/><br/>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will advance a novel semiconductor recrystallization technology to support a new generation of flexible electronics. To include on-board processing, communication, and memory circuitry, current state-of-the-art flexible electronics rely on surface mounting and soldering of off-the-shelf silicon chips, similar to rigid printed circuit board assemblies. This pick-and-place approach not only reduces device flexibility, but also leads to interconnection challenges that severely compromise device reliability. This project leverages a thin film recrystallization process where equivalent silicon circuits can now be patterned directly into flexible silicon, resulting in a highly scalable manufacturing process that drastically improves device reliability. By patterning all components directly into a high-temperature substrate, conformal electronics can be made that are durable even in heavy vibration and shock environments. The project objectives include the transition of prototype recrystallization processes to a higher throughput and higher quality pilot-scale recrystallization system. The resulting flexible silicon substrates will then be used for preliminary development of integrated circuit fabrication to produce active silicon components as a step toward fully patterned System-on-Foil electronics.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,2026115,,,,,,,,LUX SEMICONDUCTORS INC,LUX SEMICONDUCTORS INC,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:15135825,,

Despite negative publicity, they have ensured community survival where socioeconomic benefits outweigh adverse impacts. This is especially true for Small Islands (SI) where increasing sea levels and storm intensities threaten already limited land availability. This paper presents coastal vulnerability in sao Miguel Island (the Azores SI archipelago) and considers SI issues with regard to coastal land loss. Regional wave statistics using 1998 to 2011 wind record showed: periods ranging from 7 to 13s (circa 83%); wave heights between 1 and 3 m (circa 60%); and increasing trends in westerly (p = 0.473), easterly (p = 0.632) and southeasterly (p = 0.932) waves. Sea level analyses between 1978 and 2007 indicated a statistically significant rising trend (2.5 +/- 0.4 mm yr(-1); p = 0.000), while between 1996 and 2007 it was 3.3 +/- 1.5 mm yr(-1) (p = 0.025), agreeing with other global sea level studies. Based on 2001 and 2008 population data and using zonal statistics, circa 60% of the Island's population was found to reside within I km of the sea and the percentage of total population was linearly correlated with distance from the shoreline (r(2) = 99%). Three case studies show hard coastal engineering solutions preserved Azorean coastal lifestyle and had little or no observed negative impacts on their environs. Although hard engineering is likely to remain a valuable and feasible coastal protection option, an inventory of sao Miguel's population distribution, surf breaks, bathymetry and coastal erosion rates showed the potential of using multifunctional artificial reefs as a soft engineering solution. These offshore submerged breakwaters offer coastal protection while providing additional benefits such as surfing amenity and beach widening.

The ultimate aim of artificial reefs is to improve sportfishing in generally barren coastal waters for small boat fishermen. Thigmotropism, schooling behavior, shelter, and food are all important in the success of artificial habitat in improving fishing. A replication experiment, utilizing car bodies, streetcars, concrete shelters and quarry rock, indicated that quarry rock and concrete shelters probably are the best for artificial reefs, with quarry rock coasting about half that of 5 x 8 x 21/2 foot concrete shelters in this area. Automobile bodies, and to a lesser extent, streetcars, provide good low-cost reefs for about 3 or 4 years. Large fishes appear first on artificial reefs, which act as collecting stations; later as the reefs approach natural conditions, plant and animal populations exhibit fluctuations similar to natural reef eco-systems. Semi-resident fishes of the area make up most of the artificial reef or oil installation populations. A naturally-seeded kelp bed on a car body reef added considerably to its success. Oil installations were beneficial to the fauna and flora. Washed drill cuttings deposited on the bottom, were not deleterious to marine life in the area. || ABSTRACT AUTHORS: J. G.

The analyses lasted 2-3 years and regarded species diversity, abundance and biomass. Species numbers were higher in SH. The most abundant fish was the small-sized goby Gobiusculus flavescens, the most abundant invertebrates were polychaetes, crustaceans and, especially, mussels, Mytilus edulis, which were massively present. The diversity by abundance was, therefore, low. Evenness attained in TR almost slight homogeneity whereas it was low in SH. Biomass was higher in TR because it was the more dominated by mussels. Other invertebrates and phytobenthos surpassed in SH the biomass values of TR. Biomass diversity was extremely low. Whereas in TR the community structure was different between the years 2001 and 2002, the values of both years were identical in SH. The differences of results between the two localities can be related to the respective stages of succession which maybe dominance (mussels) controlled in TR whereas it is founder (algae) controlled in SH.

Three artificial reefs were built in the Huron-Erie corridor in the Great Lakes to replace lost spawning habitat. Genetic data were collected to determine the source and numbers of adult lake sturgeon spawning on the reefs and to determine if the founder effect resulted in reduced genetic diversity. DNA was extracted from larval tail clips and 12 microsatellite loci were amplified. Larval genotypes were then compared to 22 previously studied spawning lake sturgeon populations in the Great Lakes to determine the source of the parental population. The effective number of breeders (N-b) was calculated for each reef cohort. The larval genotypes were then compared to the source population to determine if there were any losses in genetic diversity that are indicative of the founder effect. The St. Clair and Detroit River adult populations were found to be the source parental population for the larvae collected on all three artificial reefs. There were large numbers of contributing adults relative to the number of sampled larvae. There was no significant difference between levels of genetic diversity in the source population and larval samples from the artificial reefs; however, there is some evidence for a genetic bottleneck in the reef populations likely due to the founder effect. Habitat restoration in the Huron-Erie corridor is likely resulting in increased habitat for the large lake sturgeon population in the system and in maintenance of the population's genetic diversity.",,,,,,,,,15,0,0,0,14,0,17,,,1061-2971,1526-100X,,,,,,,,,,"W Virginia Univ, Div Forestry & Nat Resources, Morgantown, WV 26506 USAUS Geol Survey, Great Lakes Sci Ctr, Ann Arbor, MI 48105 USA",,,,2015-07-01,WOS:000358127300017,,

All EU countries are required to have Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) guidelines in place for such developments and whilst tracking studies of marine predators have been recommended to aid EIAs, they are as yet not a requirement. This study tracked Northern Gannets breeding on Les Etacs, a stack immediately offshore Alderney, Channel Islands, to determine their use of both local and international waters and examine the consistency between an individual's foraging trips. The 15 Northern Gannets that made at least two foraging trips foraged in three different territorial waters and their combined home-range area overlapped with nine potential offshore marine renewable energy developments. Repeatability between the first and second foraging trips made by an individual was apparent when considering the direction travelled and the maximum distance travelled from the colony, but not when considering the percentage overlap in core foraging areas, trip duration, or the total trip distance suggesting individuals did not appear to be dependent on specific foraging areas. Our findings highlight the need to consider all important seabird colonies which forage in the range of potential offshore developments and to use tracking technology to determine which colonies may be affected by such developments and the colony's dependence on these areas. Tracking studies of birds from important seabird colonies should form an integral part of the EIA process for marine renewable developments. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

The loose tires have physically damaged benthic reef fauna on the natural reef, including corals that have recruited onto individual tires. Due to the biological damage caused by the mobile tires, a large-scale removal plan has been initiated. To assess damage, and to acquire a baseline to evaluate the effectiveness of the tire removal, an examination of existing biota was accomplished. Live corals were absent on the natural substrate of the Middle reef edge buried by tires. However, on tires the abundance of corals is similar to that found on neighboring hardbottom reef tracts.

Size-selective mortality was present but similar between the inshore and offshore reefs. Finally, growth declined with pre-molt size and Was higher in the inshore than offshore reefs. These results indicated that the offshore reefs were likely dominated by smaller shrimp (at high density) due to higher settlement, lower growth rates and longer periods of susceptibility to size-selective mortality. To better understand the source-sink implications of our results, we developed a demographic model parameterized from our field estimates of size-specific molt frequency and mortality and region-specific (inshore or offshore) settlement and growth rates. We simulated settlement, mortality and growth both inshore and offshore and estimated reproductive output in the 2 regions. We found that shrimp in the inshore region exhibited higher levels of reproductive output than did shrimp in the offshore region. This suggests that the off shore region is acting as a population sink despite its higher local population size,",,,,,,,,,7,0,0,0,7,0,9,,,0171-8630,1616-1599,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Florida, Dept Zool, Gainesville, FL 32611 USAFish Passage Ctr, Portland, OR 97213 USA",Fish Passage Ctr,,,2008-01-01,WOS:000257050600013,,

The geographical focus is on the Nordic-Baltic energy region and the technological focus is on onshore wind power and power transmission, which are considered key technologies in achieving carbon-neutral energy systems in northern Europe. We combine qualitative analysis of social acceptance with quantitative assessments of scenarios using techno-economic energy-system modelling. Key factors in and consequences of social acceptance are identified, especially environmental, health, and distributional factors, as well as costs for developers and society. The energy system analysis includes four scenarios illustrating the system effects and costs of low social acceptance. The results indicate that if low social acceptance were to restrict investments in onshore wind power, costlier solar photovoltaics and offshore wind power would step in. Greater social acceptance cost for onshore wind and transmission lines favours local solutions and a more balanced renewable energy mix. There are important distributional effects: no restrictions on transmission line investments benefit power producers while raising consumer prices in the Nordic-Baltic energy region, while very low social acceptance of onshore wind power would lead to 12% higher consumer costs. The results imply that socio-technical and political factors such as social acceptance may significantly affect transition pathway scenarios based on techno-economic variables alone. Therefore, the techno-economic, socio-technical and political layers of co-evolution of energy systems should be considered when analysing long-term energy transitions.

Results showed that the biomass of macroinvertebrates in the ASR increased with the age of the ASR. Based on self -organizing map (SOM), the macroinvertebrate community of short-term artificial reef (SAR), medium-term artificial reef (MAR) and long-term artificial reef (LAR) emerged as a cluster, which may indicate that the benthic community in the ASR formed after three years. The age of the ASR was the main factor affecting the benthic community. The macroinvertebrates belonged to six phyla, Platyhelminthes, Nemertea, Annelida, Mollusca, Arthropoda and Echinodermata, among which the latter four were the ones that contributed the most for abundance. The biomass of Mollusca increased dramatically with age. The dissimilarity of the species composition of Mollusca was mainly caused by Meretrix meretrix and Protothaca jedoensis. The two species accounted for 15.61%, 28.05% and 75.11% of the macroinvertebrate biomass found in SAR, MAR and LAR, respectively. The ASR might be served as a bivalve stock enhancement tool. We conclude that ASR could assemble macrobenthos effectively and increase the environmental quality of the adjacent area, being a valid option for marine habitat restoration purposes.

This study examined the effects of population density, sex, and habitat on lionfish condition (i.e. mass relative to total length) and size-at-age. Lionfish density was estimated with a remotely operated vehicle during 2010-2017 at a series of nGOM natural (n = 16) and artificial (n = 22) reefs, and individual lionfish (n = 3296) were sampled at additional reefs in the same system between 2013 and 2017. Mean lionfish total length increased across time, while density increased through 2015 and then stabilized or slightly declined. Lionfish density at artificial reefs was 2 orders of magnitude greater than at natural reefs throughout the study. Fish condition was lower on artificial reefs across all years, and lower on natural reefs during 2015-2017 versus 2013-2014. Age estimates obtained from sagittal otoliths ranged from 0.2-7.7 yr, corresponding to birth years between 2008 and 2016. There were significant differences in growth and size-at-age between sexes and habitats, with males attaining larger sizes-at-age than females and fish growing faster at natural reefs. Significant declines in mean size-at-age and condition as a function of lionfish density were also observed.

The purpose of this study is to know the influence of narrowing the reef gap on the bottom current velocity. We conducted numerical analysis by using the fully nonlinear Boussinesq equations derived by Wei etal (1995) and taking account of the energy dissipation due to wave breaking. This method was applied to the actual field in Japan Sea. Three ratios of opening width, W to the top deck length of the artificial reef, Lr; Lr/W=3, 4, and 5 are examined. The return flow velocity at the opening was 1.9 and 1.8 times of that evaluated from the mass transport for Lr/W= 3 and 5, respectively. Increase of return flow velocity is quantitatively shown for narrowing the gap. Moreover, the circulation pattern inside the reefs is changed by the width of the gap. And since the responses of the bottom shear stress, which is the major force to transport the sea bottom sediment, to the bottom water particle velocity are different for steady currents and for oscillatory currents the decomposition of currents into two modes is necessary. The bottom shear stress was evaluated by the decomposed velocities together with the friction factor. The topographical change was computed by the sediment flux and budget equations. The simulated results were verified through the comparison with the experimental ones in the hydraulic laboratory. This method was also applied to the actual field facing Japan Sea and quantitatively reproduced the measured local scour at the offshore region of the reef opening. This application shows that one-storm waves with the duration of 24 hours can produce significant scour of the maximum depth, 3m.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,15560449,,,,,,,,Hachinohe National Collage of Technology,Hachinohe National Collage of Technology,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:14494656,,

The lower depth limit of scleractinian coral growth moved up from 10m to 6 m, while live coral cover decline is less apparent now than in the early decades of augmented sediment loading. Coral community structure has changed with dominance shifting to more low-light tolerant species such as those of the genera Pectinia and Turbinaria. Reef restoration to increase coral cover of degraded reefs and initiate colonisation of non-reef areas is considered to be viable following observations of predictable mass spawning events, recruitment and vigorous growth, but the techniques employed need to account for the high sediment conditions and destabilised reef substrate. The deployment of fibreglass artificial reef units increased opportunities for coral establishment, and supported at least 106 reef taxa, including 29 scleractinian genera after 10 years. As vital components of restoration, coral nurseries comprising mesh-net platforms raised above the reef floor prevented sediment accumulation and smothering, and enabled the rearing of coral fragments and juveniles with reduced mortality. This included the nurturing of 'corals of opportunity' (naturally fragmented pieces of live coral lying on the reef bed as well as recruits settled on loose rubble), which would otherwise be killed by sedimentation. Transplants of massive or encrusting species displayed higher survival over branching ones. Restoration strategies need to be adapted to changed environmental conditions caused by anthropogenic disturbances. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

In total, 31,049 soaring birds of at least 27 species were counted, by far the most numerous being the White Stork Ciconia ciconia (23,358 ind.), followed by the Lesser Spotted Eagle Aquila pomarina (3,112 ind.). In Karnobat area, situated farther from the Black Sea coast, the total number of soaring migrants (21,231) was more than two-fold higher than in Sredets area (9,818). Overall, there was a significant difference in flock size and flight altitude within separate area (i.e. among observation points) as well as between the two observation areas and the three 5-day periods. However, there was a substantial variance in factors significantly affecting the flock size and flight altitude among most numerous individual species. In general, birds passed at much higher altitude above Karnobat area (mean flight altitude 208.3 m +/- 6.4) compared to Sredets area (mean flight altitude 130.5 m +/- 4.4). In both observation areas, northern direction was the most commonly observed flight direction (46.3% of all recorded flight directions). The highest numbers of soaring migrants passed in the late afternoon, between 15.00 and 18.00 hrs - 11,554 individuals (43.0% of all birds counted). The study confirmed that the front of Western Black Sea migration route, or Via Pontica as part of the Mediterranean/Black Sea Flyway in SE Bulgaria, is rather wide, since the magnitude of inland migration in Bourgas district can be compared with that along the Black Sea coast, at least during spring migration. Both observation areas qualify as Important Bird Areas (IBA) of European importance according to the several BirdLife International criteria.

They are known to be displaced by various marine industry activities, including construction and operation of offshore wind farms. However, the consequences of displacement for individuals and consequently on the population as a whole are unknown. On 2nd May 2017, seven scientists with particular expertise in red-throated diver ecology and/or the energetic and demographic consequences of displacement for marine birds were invited to a workshop. Using their expertise and knowledge of divers and other marine birds, plus fundamental ecological principles, some generalisations about how red-throated divers might be affected by displacement were sought. This report comprises the main points of discussion and agreement during the workshop. For displacement to cause a population-level change the following needs to occur. Divers need to show a behavioural response to anthropogenic marine structures, leading them to forage in a different area. This needs to cause a change in energy budgets either through increased energy costs of displacement and barrier effects or decreased energy intake through reduced prey acquisition and assimilation. This, in turn, would lead to poorer body condition with associated impacts on demographic rates, e.g. reduced breeding success or survival. Finally, a sufficient number of individuals need to have altered demographic rates for it to affect population growth rate and size. It is difficult to draw concrete conclusions about how displacement will affect individuals and populations of red-throated divers, in the absence of empirical evidence. Based on our understanding of the ecology of red-throated divers and similar species, the following would seem to be more likely. Red-throated divers appear capable of utilising a range of marine habitats and prey species. They also tend to occur at relatively low densities and not in large aggregations. Consequently, reduced prey intake caused by increased density-dependent competition or interference would seem unlikely. Red-throated divers are highly mobile in winter which may mean they are better able to find alternative foraging sites following displacement. However, individuals tend to be relatively site faithful in winter and in their choice of staging/moulting areas (even though there is large variation among individuals in choice of site). Red-throated divers show a strong stress response and this could temporarily limit their ability to exploit new locations following displacement, even if prey is abundant. Without understanding why divers are so mobile and how their behaviour changes following displacement, it is not possible to infer the energetic consequences of displacement with any certainty. Year-round energetic budgets of red-throated divers are unknown but this information is key to understanding the possible consequences of displacement. An understanding of red-throated diver time budgets during winter, e.g. proportion of time spent foraging, would indicate when individuals are struggling to find sufficient food and might be in poorer condition. If red-throated divers tend to be in poorer condition in the non-breeding season when displacement is occurring, displacement could have an impact on survival and productivity. However, if individuals are in relatively good condition during the non-breeding season and spend only a small proportion of their daily activity budget foraging, they may have the capacity to buffer against any additional energetic expense of displacement and barrier effects.",,,,,,,,,4,0,0,0,4,0,4,,,0963-8091,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2017-11-24,ZOOREC:ZOOR15312077482,,

As artificial reef deployments should be accompanied by clear and measurable goals and thus subsequent environmental impact monitoring and performance evaluation, there is a need to develop cost-effective monitoring programs. This study provides proof of concept for a citizen science approach to monitoring the fish faunas of artificial reefs (Reef Vision). Recreational fishers were recruited to collect video samples using Baited Remote Underwater Video systems and submit the resultant footage for analysis and interpretation by professional scientists. Reef Vision volunteers were able to collect enough data of sufficient quality to monitor the Bunbury and Dunsborough artificial reefs in Geographe Bay, south-western Australia. Data were extracted from the footage and used in robust univariate and multivariate analyses, which determined that a soak time of 45 min was sufficient to capture >= 95% of the number of species, abundance, diversity and composition of the fish fauna. The potential for these data to detect differences in the characteristics of the fish fauna between reefs and seasons was also investigated and confirmed. With the continuing deployment of artificial reefs around the world, the use of similar cost-effective citizen science monitoring approaches can help determine the effectiveness of these structures in achieving their aims and goals and provide valuable data for researchers, managers and decision makers.

We examined abundance, species richness, and species composition of epifauna associated with aggregations, sampling snails from 12 aggregations and collecting epifauna from snails. We estimated 49 100 organisms (+/- 7400) within a 25 m(2) area of an aggregation, many of which were juvenile invertebrates, and 193 species (95% CI 178-224) representing at least 7 trophic guilds. Epifauna occur on H. nigritus because shell structure provides benthic habitat heterogeneity, although biological characteristics of this foundation species may influence the associated composition of epifauna. To test this hypothesis, we anchored artificial reefs constructed of black murex shells and compared epifaunal communities that developed on them to those on aggregations. Abundance of epifauna was not different between aggregations and artificial reefs (p = 0.4); however, species composition was different (p = 0,005, R = 0.7). Epifaunal communities of aggregations had higher numbers of filter feeders and grazers than artificial reefs. Black murex snails illustrate that mobile benthic organisms can function as a foundation species and that biological characteristics of a foundation species may influence the associated composition of species. This system is ephemeral in nature, and epifauna that occur each spring and summer on snails may vary considerably.

Despite the high and growing importance of water-based recreation to the Australian economy, and the known fragility of many Australian ecosystems, there has been relatively limited research into the effects of marine tourism and recreation, infrastructure and activities, on aquatic resources. In this paper we have reviewed the ecological impacts on fauna that are caused by outdoor recreation (including tourism) in Australian coastal marine ecosystems. We predict that the single most potentially severe impact of recreation may be the introduction and/or dispersal of non-indigenous species of marine organisms by recreational vessels. Such introductions, together with other impacts due to human activities have the potential to increasingly degrade recreation destinations. In response, governments have introduced a wide range of legislative tools (e.g., impact assessment, protected area reservation) to manage the recreational industry. It would appear, however, that these instruments are not always appropriately applied. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

This study addresses the importance of habitat selection by recruits in establishing the local pattern of adult distribution in two sympatric Caribbean damselfish species, Stegastes dorsopunicans and S. planifrons. Both species inhabit shallow reefs but show little overlap in their distribution; S. dorsopunicans predominates in the reef crest and S. planifrons occurs primarily on the reef slope. Furthermore, S. dorsopunicans is associated with rocky substrate, while S. planifrons occupies live coral. The substrate cover follows a similar pattern with coral being much less common on the reef crest than on the reef slope. Monitoring recruitment every other day in reciprocal removal experiments and artificial reefs indicates that the observed pattern of local adult distribution is a product of habitat selection for both species. The presence or absence of conspecifics did not influence recruitment patterns for either species. Stegastes dorsopunicans recruited primarily to shallow, rocky areas, appearing to cue on both substratum type and depth. Stegastes planifrons recruited exclusively to coral substratum independent of depth.

Previous studies have focused on relatively small, simple ARs for the estimation of wake regions. Thanks to progressive artificial reef industry, nowadays relatively large, complex ARs are being installed on the seabed; hence, it is necessary to investigate how to secure wake region of those ARs. In this study, the concept of wake volume was used to estimate the wake regions of five relatively complex artificial reefs (ARs). The element-based finite volume method was used to estimate wake volume, and its fluctuation due to the size of the ARs and the inflow velocity was calculated. From the analysis results, it was found that the thickness and area of the structural members of the ARs are important to secure wake region. However, wake region was not created if the AR is composed of only a thin steel frame. This indicates that the function of the structural members of the ARs that blocks the flow is important for the creation of the wake region. In the case of AR in which a wake region occurs, the AR size (height) has a significant positive correlation with the magnitude of the wake region, and if the inflow flow velocity is 1.0 mÂ·s-1 or more, a sufficient eddy currents occur and accordingly no variation in wake volume is observed. Thus, to increase wake region, it is shown that not only the size of AR, but also the thickness and area of the structural members play an important role.",,,,,,,,,2,0,0,0,0,0,2,,,1229-8999,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2021-06-22,KJD:ART002660216,,

Routine scientific surveys largely target bottom or near seabed fisheries and are therefore not wholly appropriate for sampling pelagic species; however, they do provide consistency of methodology and standardisation. Angling returns have a particular value, in that other species may be targeted and anglers can sample ground unavailable to conventional trawls, however, anglers tend only to report large or specimen fish and may report the place of catch as the place of landing. There is some angler reluctance to disclose detail of location of capture of certain species. In general, recreational/anecdotal material did not contradict the findings of scientific survey based evidence, illustrating that these types of data, when considered together, can provide a sound basis for management recommendations. Key findings were: [center dot] Angel shark appears now to be severely depleted and deserves special protection from impacts of fishing. [center dot] The local status of basking shark is known largely though sightings close to the shore of the Northern Irish coast, as these fish migrate to or from feeding and courtship grounds. There are no directed fisheries and accidental bycatch in fisheries is very uncommon. [center dot] The overall North-east Atlantic population of spurdog is depleted and, although angling catches appear to be increasing in Northern Irish waters; this reflects recent changes in recreational fishing patterns and intensity. [center dot] Tope regularly occur in small numbers in scientific trawl surveys and are targeted by anglers and caught as accidental bycatch in Irish Sea fisheries. A seasonal occurrence of tope with an autumn influx to the Irish Sea and the presence of large females and pups in local areas, including Strangford Lough, indicate important nursery areas. [center dot] Lesser spotted dogfish appear to be stable or increasing [center dot] Nursehound appear to be stable or increasing. [center dot] White skate are now rarely observed in Northern Ireland waters and are regarded as severely depleted and extirpated from most of the Celtic Sea ecoregion. [center dot] Common skate are now severely depleted in Northern Ireland waters. [center dot] The thornback ray and blonde ray are stable or increasing in numbers.

Nursery hotspots included Belfast Lough, Carlingford Lough and off Dundrum Bay. Despite the status of some rays being stable or increasing in overall terms in the study area, their susceptibility to local depletions should be recognised.

In conclusion, this study should be considered very preliminary; it is also necessary to increase the number of tagged fish, with additional research on the behavior of reef species to better clarify these aspects.

Recent research, however, suggests the most complex habitats may not harbor the highest density of individuals and number of species, especially in areas with elevated human influence. Understanding nuances in relationships between habitat heterogeneity and ecological communities is warranted to guide habitat-focused conservation and management efforts. We conducted fish and structural habitat surveys of thirty warm-temperate reefs on the southeastern US continental shelf to quantify how structural complexity influences fish communities. We found that intermediate complexity maximizes fish abundance on natural and artificial reefs, as well as species richness on natural reefs, challenging the current paradigm that abundance and other fish community metrics increase with increasing complexity. Naturally occurring rocky reefs of flat and complex morphologies supported equivalent abundance, biomass, species richness, and community composition of fishes. For flat and complex morphologies of rocky reefs to receive equal consideration as essential fish habitat (EFH), special attention should be given to detecting pavement type rocky reefs because their ephemeral nature makes them difficult to detect with typical seafloor mapping methods. Artificial reefs of intermediate complexity also maximized fish abundance, but human-made structures composed of low-lying concrete and metal ships differed in community types, with less complex, concrete structures supporting lower numbers of fishes classified largely as demersal species and metal ships protruding into the water column harboring higher numbers of fishes, including more pelagic species. Results of this study are essential to the process of evaluating habitat function provided by different types and shapes of reefs on the seafloor so that all EFH across a wide range of habitat complexity may be accurately identified and properly managed.",,,,,,,,,36,0,0,0,32,0,39,,,1932-6203,,,,,,,,,,,"Univ North Carolina Chapel Hill, Inst Marine Sci, Morehead City, NC 28557 USAUniv North Carolina Chapel Hill, Dept Biol, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USANatl Ocean & Atmospher Adm, Natl Ctr Coastal Ocean Sci, Natl Ocean Serv, Beaufort, NC USA",,,,2017-09-05,WOS:000409282800034,28873447,

Fishes were enumerated over sand, shell, and natural hard bottom reef habitats in the north-central Gulf of Mexico (GOM) off Alabama on quarterly cruises over a two-year period with a baited stationary underwater video camera array. Red snapper showed both significantly higher abundance and larger size over the reef habitat; however, no seasonal effects were observed, indicating temporal abundance patterns were consistent among seasons. Fish assemblages differed among habitats, with significant differences between reef and shell assemblages. Efforts to identify the species that most contributed to these differences indicated that the red snapper accounted for 59% of the overall similarity within the reef fish assemblage and 20% of the total, dissimilarity between the shell and reef fish assemblages.

These ?non-containment curtain traps? exploit the tendency of lionfish to aggregate around structures. The prototype traps contain a fish aggregation device (FAD) centered within an open frame. When retrieved, a net curtain is drawn up around the FAD, capturing all fish within the frame. Two pairs of traps were deployed 29 km off Pensacola, Florida in the Gulf of Mexico at a depth of 34 m. One pair was positioned 10 m and another 40 m from existing artificial reefs originally placed to provide habitat for native marine organisms, but which is now dominated by invasive lionfish. Divers counted lionfish, then removed them via spear (to simulate trap retrieval) at different intervals (simulating soak times). The traps attracted 23-40% of lionfish from the existing artificial reefs although not all lionfish were within the trap itself. Longer soak times increased capture rates: 14% of attracted lionfish were within the trap after one day, 35% after two days, and at least 80% for intervals 32 days or longer. Future tests will evaluate the effectiveness of trap modifications, and the effect of varying depths and distances from source populations. Preliminary results from these trials are encouraging and demonstrate that traps can be developed to remove lionfish from deep, remote locations throughout their invaded range, although collaboration with the fishing community will be essential to maximize efficiency.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,0361-2953,,,,,,,,,,,"National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, Office of National Marine Sanctuaries, 1305 East West Highway, N/ORM62, Silver Spring, Maryland 20910, USA",,,,2016-01-01,ZOOREC:ZOOR15512088150,,

Deploying artificial reefs of concrete pyramids with kelps attached has been commonly used and applied in this study. As a part of an effort to evaluate structural and functional recovery of created and restored habitat, the macroalgal community and food web structure were studied about a year after the establishment of the artificial macroalgal bed, making comparisons with nearby natural counterparts and barren ground communities. Dominant species, total abundance, and community structure of macroalgal assemblage at the restored macroalgal bed recovered to the neighboring natural bed levels during the study period. The main primary producers (phytoplankton and macroalgae) were isotopically well separated. delta C-13 and delta N-15 values of consumers were very similar between restored and natural beds but varied greatly among functional feeding groups. The range of consumer delta C-13 was as wide as that of primary producers, indicating the trophic importance of both producers. There was a stepwise trophic enrichment in delta N-15 with increasing trophic level. A comparison of isotope signatures between primary producers and consumers showed that, while suspension feeders are highly dependent on pelagic sources, invertebrates of other feeding guilds and fishes mainly use macroalgae-derived organic matter as their ultimate nutritional sources in both macroalgal beds, emphasizing the high equivalency of trophic structure between both beds. Isotopic signatures of a few mollusks and sea urchins showed that they use different dietary items in macroalgal-barren grounds compared with macroalgal beds, probably reflecting their feeding plasticity according to the low macroalgal biomass. However, isotopic signatures of most of the consumers at the barren ground were consistent with those at the macroalgal beds, supporting the important trophic role of drifting algae. Our results revealed the recoveries of the macroalgal community and trophic structure at the restored habitat.

Previous analysis of VMS data has demonstrated a high level of fishing around oil and gas pipelines in the North Sea. This is thought to be due to a reef effect which attracts fish to the pipeline. We present side scan and photographic imaging which clearly reveals evidence of bottom trawling within an area of 500 m either side of the pipelines. Investigation of individual photographs on transects running over the pipeline, point towards evidence for a reduction in benthic fauna on seabed where there are trawl marks compared to seabed where there are not. This likely effect is also evident on sea pens which were commonly found on the muddier ground in the survey areas. Two of the most frequent biotopes, burrowed mud and sea pens and burrowing megafauna in circalittoral fine mud, are the focus of conservation efforts through OSPAR and as 'Priority Marine Features' in Scottish waters.

Growth occurred through extra- and intra-tentacular budding. Juvenile growth, expressed as geometric diameter extension rate, of O. crispata was assessed by 2 methods. First, growth was estimated by the repeated measurement of the same colonies for a period of 12 mo. Mean growth rate was 1.04 +/- 0.05 mm mo(-1) (n = 105). Second, growth was estimated from the size of new recruits at an age of 3 mo on the PFA-concrete blocks. Mean growth rate was 0.9 +/- 0.51 mm mo(-1) (n = 10). The first approach also showed that the growth rate of O. crispata was higher in winter and spring (from December to April) than summer and autumn (from April to December).

The expansion of aquaculture in intertidal areas may impact birds and other organisms using these habitats, leading to questions of sustainability of both aquaculture and functioning estuarine ecosystems. Understanding the effect of oyster culture on shorebird activity, particularly on Red Knots (Calidris canutus rufa), a species on the U.S. Threatened List, is important for adaptive management and the expansion of oyster culture. In May 2013 we experimentally compared Red Knot and shorebird use of a beach section with racks and a control, and in 2016 we compared the use of sections with artificial reefs, oyster racks, and control on Delaware Bay, New Jersey (USA). The data included only times when no workers or other people were present. Censuses, conducted every 30 min throughout the day (279 censuses in 2013, 231 censuses in 2016), included the number of Red Knots and other shorebirds in each treatment section. In 2013, the total number of shorebirds was significantly higher in the rack section than in the control section, except for Red Knots and Ruddy Turnstones (Arenaria interpres) that occurred in higher numbers in the control than in the rack section. In 2016 Red Knot numbers were also significantly lower in the rack section. In 2013, the mean number of Red Knots/census was 13 for racks vs 59 for the control (P < 0.0002). In 2016, the mean number of Red Knots/census was 13 for racks and over 68 for other treatments (P < 0.0001). Treatment, date, and number of non-Knot shorebirds explained 60% (2013) and 69% (2016) of the variation in Red Knot numbers. Red Knots avoided the sections with racks while both foraging and roosting, suggesting that caution should be used before placing oyster racks in areas used for foraging by Red Knots.

A sidescan sonar mosaic was produced and classified according to derived backscatter parameters (mean, median and standard deviation of the backscatter values) using an unsupervised classification procedure. The accuracy of the final classified map was assessed by comparison with a ground-truthing survey in which the biological habitat was derived from underwater video footage. The sidescan correctly predicted seabed surface characteristics of observed biological habitat with 78% accuracy. A second, and more challenging test of the acoustic data to correctly predict biological habitat was made by comparing it with data from 21 grab sampling stations. These stations were divided into three groups using multivariate statistical techniques based on their backscatter properties. Benthic assemblage structure was found to be significantly distinct between the high and low, and the medium and low backscatter stations. There was a low to moderate but significant correlation between the multivariate patterns of acoustic backscatter, benthic assemblage structure, and particle size distribution. The work shows that even in areas with subtle and gradational changes in substratum, the sidescan was able to predict biological community with an acceptable accuracy. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Growth was estimated from weight-converted length increments of 142 Floy-tagged individuals at liberty for a median of 187 days. Egg production was estimated for females of three taxa (four species) as the product of the weight of batch egg production and spawning frequency (the latter determined from histological evidence of day-old postovulatory follicles). Milt production was deduced from male to female ratios of gonad weights for reproductive fish. Somatic growth rates varied three- to fourfold among the six species and, in part, reflected the distribution of maturity stages of intraspecific populations. On average, the per capita growth rates of taxa dominated by immature stages were faster than those dominated by large adults. Somatic production varied more than somatic growth rates (by a factor of 15), because of additional variations in standing stock biomass among populations. The somatic production of at least one species was underestimated as a result of a tag effect on growth. Weight-specific egg production varied only twofold among the three taxa examined, perhaps because fishes with smaller batch egg productions compensated by spawning more frequently, and vice versa. Estimates of weight-specific milt production further diverged because of the influence of relative testis-to-ovary weights that ranged from a small fraction to unity. Additional variation among taxa in total gonadal (egg plus milt) production was about one-half that of somatic production (a factor of eight). Besides representing interspecific differences in adult biomass, variations in gonadal production reflected intraspecific differences in the biomass contributions of the two sexes within the fraction of adults that were reproductively active. Despite likely substantial underestimates of gametic materials, gonadal production ranged from a large fraction to a large multiple of somatic production among the four species. Our observations suggest that the elaboration of tissue unrelated to yield is nontrivial and represents a major component of energy flow through the fishes in this reef system and perhaps others.",,,,,,,,,45,3,0,0,37,1,51,,,0007-4977,1553-6955,,,,,,,,,,"MEC ANALYT SYST INC, CARLSBAD, CA 92009 USAPORT LONG BEACH PLANNING DEPT, LONG BEACH, CA 90802 USAUNIV CALIF LOS ANGELES, ENVIRONM SCI & ENGN PROGRAM, LOS ANGELES, CA 90024 USA",MEC ANALYT SYST INCPORT LONG BEACH PLANNING DEPT,,,1994-09-01,WOS:A1994QB58400020,,

Scientists have hypothesized that artificial reefs and platforms improve and/or diversify habitat, increase resources, modify the assemblages of organisms in the region, or concentrate existing resources. The placement of these de facto reefs has undoubtedly impacted the regional marine community, although little information is available. Only recently have assessment methods been developed to test these and other hypotheses concerning artificial reefs.At the shallowest site, South Timbalier 54 (ST54, water depth 22 m), the decline in fish density with distance from the platform was precipitous; generally, after a distance of 18 m, fish densities were similar to that of the open waters of the northern Gulf of Mexico. At the deeper sites (Green Canyon 18, GC18, water depth 219 m; Grand Isle 94, GI94, 60 m), a drop in fish density with distance from the site existed; however, fish density was higher at greater distances from the platform. As we defined it, the area of influence extended 10 m at GC18 and 18 m at GI94. Six species made up more than 90% of the fishes observed at each site on any survey and platform assemblages could be characterized as not specious and dominated by a few species at each structure. By site, the dominant six species (highest to lowest abundance) were GC18: creole-fish Paranthias furcifer, blue runner Caranx crysos, Bermuda chub Kyphosus sectatrix, almaco jack Seriola rivoliana, greater amberjack S. dumerili, and great barracuda Sphyraena barracuda; GI94: blue runner, horse-eye jack C. latus, red snapper Lutjanus campechaaus, mangrove snapper (also known as gray snapper) L. griseus, gray triggerfish Balistes capriscus, and great barracuda; ST54: Atlantic spadefish Chaetodipterus faber, bluefish Pomatomus saltatrix, blue runner, mangrove snapper, red snapper, and sheepshead Archosargus probatocephalus. While the species assemblages found at each site were unique, the dominant species at each site was different and some overlap of observed species existed between sites. Seasonal migrations were common at each of the study sites. Mean densities observed were 0.333 (+/-0.034) fish/m(3) at ST54, 0.496 (+/-0.017) fish/m(3) at GI94, and 0.029 (+/-0.003) fish/ m(3) at GC18.

Monthly visual counts were taken for a year of the fish populations at the tire reef. Those were compared with counts taken of a rocky reef near by. The tire reef showed greater abundance, biomass and dominance of a few commercial species. Lutjanus guttatus, L. argentiventris, Haemulon steindachneri and H. scudderi were the most abundant and accounted for over 90% of the monthly changes in biomass. Although no clear pattern was found to explain the monthly variations in abundance, we believe that changes in water turbidity increased the error in population estimates. Gonadal ripeness analysis in L. guttatus indicated that 75% of the organisms were immature. The evidence, coupled with our visual observations, leads us to believe that the tire reef can be considered as a nursery area for commercial fish species. Artificial reef construction in areas of high diversity of commercial fish species could increase survival of their juvenile stages.

It includes visual censuses of fish assemblages and standardized fishing operations made by professional (trammel net) and amateur (hook-and-line) fishermen within and outside the reserve. Both methods attest that the abundance and the individual size of the most valuable fish species are markedly increasing, and that the behaviour of these species tends to be more natural.

These natural phenomena offer a huge source of pollution-free energy. The energy from this source might be capable of replacing all the energy presently supplied by the existing fossil burning plants. This means, that the harvest from this source of energy is capable of drastically reducing the amount of polluting gases which are presently being emitted into the atmosphere. In addition to the above, this source does not pose such colossal potential dangers to humans, as the use of nuclear energy. Nor does it cause the often so unpleasant noise pollution generated by wind farms. However, to the best of the author's knowledge, this source of energy still remains unexploited. This paper discusses five of the major obstacles which, till now, have prevented this objective from becoming a reality. These are:a. The random nature of the variations in the occurrence and the intensity of the sea waves, makes the supply of energy from that source very irregular and unreliable.b. The corrosive activity of the sea water and of secretions from certain forms of sea life, creates a need of frequent replacements of the wetted parts, respectively the need to make them of exotic and often very expensive materials.c. The blocking, clogging and jamming of the equipment by seaweeds and other matter which is being carried by the waves, may cause frequent interruptions in the operations of the power plant and extra expenses on cleaning the affected parts of the equipment.d. The destructive nature of the sea waves, like the abrasion of parts by particles of sand which are carried by the waves, or the impact of floating logs of fallen trees etc. may require frequent shutdowns of the plant and costly repairs.e. The economic aspects of such a power plant. The cost of constructing and of running such a plant has to be adequately low. To allow an affordable supply of power.This paper present the outline of a design, which is capable of reducing the severity of all the obstacles listed above, to tolerable limits.",,,,,2nd International Conference on Energy Sustainability2nd International Conference on Energy Sustainability,"AUG 10-14, 2008AUG 10-14, 2008","ASME, Adv Energy Syst Div; ASME, Solar Energy DivASME, Adv Energy Syst Div; ASME, Solar Energy Div","Jacksonville, FLJacksonville, FL",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,978-0-7918-4319-2,,,,,,,,,,,,,2009-01-01,WOS:000265637200030,,

Experimental reef plots were constructed using Pecten maximus shell as cultch. Clumps of live adult M. modiolus were translocated from nearby natural reefs into cultch with a high profile (elevated cultch), cultch with a low profile (flattened cultch), as well as directly into the seafloor. The aim of the study was to test the hypothesis that translocated mussel clumps would increase habitat complexity thus accelerating community succession and enhancing natural recruitment of M. modiolus spat. These effects were predicted to be greater on elevated cultch due to greater protection from predators and increased accessibility to food resources. Within the artificial reef array the translocated clumps had a significant positive effect on recruitment compared to cultch without mussels with average densities of spat settled on the translocated M. modiolus clumps ranging from 100 to 200 individuals m(-2) compared to 4 to 52 spat m(-2) on cultch without mussels. Recruitment of M. modiolus spat was also significantly higher on translocated horse mussels when compared to natural reefs where densities of 8-36 spat m(-2) were recorded. Reef elevation appeared to provide some degree of protection from predators but differences in translocated M. modiolus survival on the different elevation treatments were not significant. In total, 223 taxa were recorded 12 months after reef construction. The presence of translocated clumps of M. modiolus was the main driver of the increases in faunal diversity and species abundance. Application of objective criteria to assess the performance of artificial reefs suggested that translocation of M. modiolus clumps alone achieved most of the restoration objectives. Consequently this pilot study demonstrates a straightforward and realistic intervention technique that could be used to kick start the regeneration and expansion of impacted mussel and similar biogenic reefs elsewhere.

Birds are potentially endangered by offshore WEPs due to: (I) collisions with WEPs (bird strike), (2) short term loss of habitat during construction and/or servicing of the plants, (3) long term loss of habitat because of displacement (frightening away) of birds by WEPs, (4) barrier effects on migrants, (5) disruption of ecologically linked units. In order to estimate the potential conflict between the separate parameters, it is essential to know the spatial and temporal distribution of birds as well as details of their behaviour (migration, foraging, influence of weather) and behavioural responses in relation to offshore WEPs and to maintenance vessels (fleeing distance, avoidance manoeuvres, consequences of lighting, collision risk). This project was therefore designed to close gaps in the knowledge on temporal and spatial distribution of mainly migratory birds as well as to obtain more precise information on altitude distribution of migration over the North and Baltic Sea by consulting the literature and applying various field methods. In 2001 we carried out own observations of spring and autumn migration on the islands of Helgoland (North Sea), Fehmarn and Rugen (Baltic Sea), using visual, acoustic and radar methods. Additional data from military large range surveillance radar were analysed in cooperation with the 'Amt fur Geoinformationswesen der Bundeswehr'. The collected data are intended to assess the risk of WEPs for birds as well as to provide a basis for the classification of the conservational significance of the various planning sites. The combined evaluation of all aspects is intended to result in the development of a method to facilitate the assessment of appropriate zones for construction of WEPs taking into account the problem of migratory and resting birds. According to visual standardized observations, birds migrate over the German Bight near Helgoland throughout the year (this probably also applies for the Baltic Sea, although it is not been substantiated by continuous observations within this project). Spring and autumn migration are of similar magnitude with regard to bird numbers. Migration mainly takes place from February to May and from August to November. Standardized seawatching, visual raptor and passerine observations recorded a total of 136.000 individuals belonging to 168 species at the three locations. The migratory intensity varies from day to day. An average of more than 500 birds per hour was recorded at all three sites during the main migratory periods. Raptors, cranes, pigeons, swifts and Dunnock tend to fly primarily at high altitudes (> 50 m). Herons and most song birds fly at mid to high altitude (mainly > 10 m). Whereas divers, gannets, cormorants, swans, geese, dabbling ducks, diving ducks, waders, gulls, terns and swallows fly mainly between 5 to 10 m and grebes, petrels, seaducks, mergansers, skuas and auks below 10 m. The altitude of migration decreases with increasing wind force and headwinds. Dabbling ducks and terns almost exclusively maintained a distance of at least 500 m from the coast. This behaviour was even more pronounced in divers, seaducks and auks, where the distance to the coast usually exceeded 2 km. These species are expected to show particularly strong avoidance manoeuvres when confronted by obstacles. The observations with ship radar showed that migration took place up to altitudes of at least 3.800 m. Since the raw data obtained with ship radars do not yield a quantitative altitude distribution, it was necessary to calculate a conversion equation in order to correct for the distribution of echoes up to an altitude of 1.800 m. According to the radar observations, more than 20 % of all birds migrate at an altitude below 200 m at Helgoland and Ruegen, while more than 30 % fly below this altitude at Fehmarn (taking into account that birds flying immediately above the sea surface cannot be detected by the radar). During spring, migration generally took place at lower altitudes. The migration altitude was lowest during the afternoon hours and increased after sunset to attain the highest values two hours after sunset. Thereafter the altitude again decreased and remained relatively low in the second half of the night. However, between 16% and 25% of all echoes still occurred below 200 m during the night (main period of migration). During rain and headwinds birds clearly migrate at lower altitudes. During spring, the main direction of migration was NE, whereby a large proportion of bird movements took place in the opposite direction, particularly on Helgoland. The autumn migration was usually directed to SW to SSW at all locations. Only on Ruegen there was also a distinct movement in the opposite direction (NNE). On Fehmarn the main flight direction was at right angles to the coast (birds crossing the Fehmarn Belt). It was almost exclusively parallel to the coast of Rugen. The average speeds of migration on all locations differed with season (distinctly faster during spring than in autumn). The military radar confirmed the main direction of migration but also revealed undirected movements on Fehmarn, north of Ruegen and in the Pomeranian Bight during the day. These are attributed to foraging birds (gulls, ducks changing between feeding locality). The seasonal course of migratory intensity varies markedly and is characterised by a few days of extremely high activity. Half of all birds pass through within 5% to 10% of the total number of days. The migratory intensity is also subject to strong diurnal variation: The least activity was usually recorded in the afternoon hours, independent of location or season, whereas it increased markedly about one hour after sunset. During the course of the night, until sunrise, the intensity again decreased. The highest activity was observed during tailwinds. During calm conditions and slight headwinds (predominant weather condition) there was also intense migration. During rain, migration was less or commenced later. There was significant accordance in migratory intensity determined with different methods for divers, seaducks, finches and thrushes. This was not the case for gulls and raptors. Despite some disparity, the radar data provide a representative picture of current migration of sea and coastal birds as well as of songbirds. The military radar data confirmed that there is a wide band of intensive migration along the entire coast from the Netherlands up to Denmark. There is also a wide hand of almost equivalent intensity in the Baltic, from Schleswig-Holstein and Mecklenburg-Vorpommern to Denmark and Sweden. An exception is the migratory activity (presumably of sea ducks and gulls) in the region north of Ruegen and in the Pomeranian Bight. Methods to quantify flight movements, to determine bird strike risk and to assess suited areas for the construction of WEPs, were evaluated. Accordingly, the use of a combination of different techniques (visual, radar and thermal imaging cameras) as well as information on distribution at sea is unavoidable. With regard to the overall assessment of the risk potential displacement and bird strike are the most critical factors. The effects of illumination of WEPs remain unclear. Further research is required in order to obtain improved reliability and estimates of the variability in bird migration presented in this report. This means including more data from more years, improved evaluation of collision risk and finally the impact of WEPs at the population level. There is a need to develop methods to minimize bird strikes and also to improve the understanding of bat migration over the North and-Baltic Seas.",,,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,,,0944-5730,,,,,,,,,,,"Institut fuer Vogelforschung Vogelwarte Helgoland, Inselstation, Postfach 1220, D-27494 Helgoland, Germany",,,,2004-01-01,ZOOREC:ZOOR14112071007,,

Data were based on monthly trawl surveys over a single year carried out eighteen years apart. The spectra show significant differences between the two periods, indicating major shifts in the trophic structure of the system. Specifically, biomass of the omnivorous, estuarine species in the middle of the foodweb (originally dominating) has been replaced by carnivorous and herbivorous-detritivorous species. As a consequence, the initial sigmoid shape of the BTLS has tended to become more linear. However, interpretation of the causes involved remains unclear. It is suggested that this potential indicator of trophic status of the fish community reflects a combination of interacting driving forces acting simultaneously in the lagoon: (i) increased marine conditions as well as artificial reefs constructed in adjacent zones may enhance biomass of marine predators and detritivorous species; (ii) attenuation of estuarine influences may lead to decreasing biomass of estuarine generalist species; and (iii) the establishment of a marine protected area may increase predator biomass, causing a decline in prey biomass.

Some of the earliest explorations of mesophotic coral ecosystems (MCEs) involving both submersibles and rebreather diving focused on fishes. Since 1968, over 400 publications have documented fishes on MCEs, similar to 75% of which were published since 2011. Most fish species inhabiting MCEs belong to families and genera typical of shallow coral reefs, and many new species remain to be discovered and described. Species richness generally peaks at a depth of 30 m and declines with increasing depth. The composition of the fish communities on MCEs includes a mixture of species restricted to MCEs and species with broad depth ranges. Patterns of species turnover and composition vary depending on geographic location, ecological characteristics, and method of study. Nearly 70% of MCE fish research has occurred within the tropical western Atlantic and Hawai'i. Not enough is known about global distributions to infer broad biogeographical patterns, but there seems to be higher representation by endemic species and individuals on MCEs, and the eastward attenuation of diversity of shallow Pacific reefs does not appear to apply to fishes within MCEs. Analyses of nearly 900,000 occurrence records of reef fishes at depths of 1-200 m reveal patterns of diversity that are mostly consistent with controlled studies. Future work should emphasize basic exploration and documentation of diversity in under-sampled geographic regions and hypothesis-driven studies in areas where logistics facilitate MCE research.",,,,,,,,,23,0,0,0,24,2,27,,,,,978-3-319-92735-0; 978-3-319-92734-3,,,,,,,,,"Bernice P Bishop Museum, Honolulu, HI 96817 USANOAA, Papahanaumokuakea Marine Natl Monument, Honolulu, HI USACalif Acad Sci, San Francisco, CA 94118 USAHawaii Inst Marine Biol, Kaneohe, HI USA",Bernice P Bishop MuseumHawaii Inst Marine Biol,,,2019-10-16,WOS:000487754900041,,

Results show that areas of highest potential visual impact are sheltered coastal areas with complex geomorphological features such as barrier islands, peninsulas, straits, archipelagos and lagoons in combination with intensive anthropogenic activity and presence of nature protected areas.

These effects are not limited to the immediate physical damage, but can have wide-spread and lasting impacts due to alteration of the chemical makeup of the surrounding water column. This can subsequently impact the growth of benthic organisms, often leading to phase shifts and high levels of mortality of corals in the vicinity of the wreck. At Palmyra atoll, the grounding of a longline fishing vessel on the shallow reef terrace is associated with a phase shift to the corallimorph, Rhodactis howesii. In 2013, a wreck removal effort initiated by the US Department of Fish and Wildlife resulted in the successful extraction and disposal of the wreckage, after which the density and percent cover of R. howesii in the immediate vicinity of the wreck site dropped precipitously. Here, we document the response of the fish community to the wreck removal and localized decline in R. howesii. We show that the biomass of scarid parrotfishes and acanthurid surgeonfishes and unicornfishes (primarily herbivores) increased after the removal of the wreck, while biomass of chaetodontid butterflyfishes (primarily invertivores, many species are known to feed on coelenterate polyps) declined over the study period. The density of small scarids and acanthurids also increased, but only after a few years post removal. Overall these results indicate that Palmyra's unfished herbivore population has rapidly responded to the removal of the wreck and associated decrease in corallimorph cover, can maintain high levels of grazing where space is made available for colonization of early successional algae species, and may have the potential to facilitate reef recovery.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,2296-7745; 2296-7745,,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Marine Sci Inst, Santa Barbara, CA, 93106, USA",,,,2018-11-06,ZOOREC:ZOOR15910082342,,

The results indicate that the reef acts as a hold point deflecting the longshore currents and changing the sediment pathway which resulted in morphological changes observed over longer term. Whilst expected during the design phase of the reef a long-term salient is not observed in the historical record.

J,,,,,,,,,,,Validating the Generic Application of an Innovative Second Generation Horizontal Axis Cross Flow Tidal Turbine,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Awarded Grant,Sep 30 2010,2010,"Developing renewable energy sources in order to counter the effects of global warming is a high priority for the UK and other countries. But these sources must be economic long term, otherwise purchasers of electricity – that’s all of us – will be paying too high a price.It has long been thought that man should be able to extract energy from the tides – the unstoppable rise and fall of the ocean means that strong flows of water could be used to generate electricity. The problem has always been how to do this. So engineers looked at wind turbines, and concluded that these, suitably strengthened, would be a good way of doing just that. Now prototypes are testing whether the dream of cheap tide generated electricity can be achieved. Initial results are indicating that the machines can be made to work, but at a high cost.Three eminent engineers at Oxford’s Department of Engineering Science (Professors Guy Houlsby and Martin Oldfield, and Dr Malcolm McCulloch) a few years ago felt that they could do better and drew up designs for a radically different approach to generating power from the tides, one which should be more efficient, and cheaper as well. What’s more, it could form the basis for economically extracting power from the Severn Estuary, without many of the environmental problems posed by constructing a barrage. They called their design the Transverse Horizontal Axis Water Turbine or THAWT for short.The problem they faced was how to get their invention to market. Two engineers involved in the hydro electricity business (Sean Westrope and Peter Dixon) joined with them to set up the Kepler Energy company, whose aim is to commercialise THAWT and take it into world markets. But to do this, more fundamental work was necessary. Detailed tests were needed to evaluate the forces in the machine in order to produce a design made of real world materials. And a detailed plan had to be drawn up to make the machine, install it and operate it – and make money from it.This is where the TSB came in – by matching the investment of the hydro engineers, it provided some of the finance to do these tests and to formulate the plans.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,100863,,,,,,,,The Small Hydro Company Ltd,The Small Hydro Company Ltd,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:15328784,,

Standard spatial planning approaches, such as a Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA), may be challenging and time consuming to interpret in heavily utilized ocean spaces. Spatial autocorrelation, a statistical measure of spatial dependence, may be incorporated into the planning framework, which provides objectivity and assistance with the interpretation of spatial analysis results. Here, two case studies highlighting applications of spatial autocorrelation analyses in the northeast region of the United States of America are presented. The first case study demonstrates the use of a local indicator of spatial association analysis within a relative site suitability analysis - a variant of a MCDA - for siting a mussel longline farm. This case study statistically identified 17% of the area as highly suitable for a mussel longline farm, relative to other locations in the area of interest. The use of a clear, objective, and efficient analysis provides improved confidence for industry, coastal managers, and stakeholders planning marine aquaculture. The second case study presents an incremental spatial autocorrelation analysis with Moran's I that is performed on modeled and remotely sensed oceanographic data sets (e.g., chlorophyll a, sea surface temperature, and current speed). The results are used to establish a maximum area threshold for each oceanographic variable within the online decision support tool, OceanReports, which performs an automated spatial analysis for a user-selected area (i.e., drawn polygon) of ocean space. These thresholds provide users guidance and summary statistics of relevant oceanographic information for aquaculture planning.

One approach is to manage anthropogenic pathways to prevent the spread of established pest organisms to uninfected localities that are beyond their natural dispersal capacity. This paper describes the efficacy of acetic acid treatments against a variety of cosmopolitan fouling taxa, and evaluates a potential application in the treatment of foulers transported with movements of shellfish seedstock between mussel fanning areas in New Zealand. Laboratory and field experiments demonstrated that immersion in 4% acetic acid (in seawater) for as little as 1 min can eliminate many soft-bodied fouling organisms, with lower concentrations requiring longer immersion times. The effects of immersion treatment were enhanced when combined with a 24-h air exposure phase to simulate the inter-regional transport of mussel seedstock. We demonstrate that it is possible to cost-effectively treat mussels to eliminate the majority of problematical foulers without resulting in significant adverse effects to the stock either by: (i) a 4% treatment followed by a rinse to remove the acetic acid residue before transport, or (ii) application of the 4% treatment at the end of the transport phase. A concentration of 4% is equivalent to the acetic acid content of domestic vinegar, hence does not represent a significant environmental or occupational risk provided appropriate measures are put in place for handling and waste disposal. Acetic acid concentrations remain stable over time in the presence of organic matter, but may change during repeated use of treatment solutions. To ensure treatment criteria are being achieved, field determination of acetic acid levels can be made using simple titration-based approaches. Because of an apparent buffering effect in the case of sequential shellfish seedstock immersion, pH could not be used to estimate acetic acid concentrations in this instance, but may provide a simple and reliable field-based indicator for other fouling treatments. Further work to refine the treatment method should seek to maximise the 'window' between pest mortality and mussel survival, to provide assurance that high-risk species can be eliminated with minimal risk of adverse effects on seedstock. Where treatments that are completely effective against all pest organisms result in unavoidable mussel mortality, decisions about whether or not to apply them must balance treatment costs and benefits against the unmanaged risks and consequences of pest incursion.

It can be challenging to identify the relevant local wildlife population for impact assessment for those species that are continuously distributed and highly mobile. Here, we document the existence of local communities of Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops aduncus) inhabiting coastal and estuarine waters of Perth, Western Australia, where major coastal developments have been undertaken or are proposed. Using sighting histories from a 4-year photo-identification study, we investigated fine-scale, social community structure of dolphins based on measures of social affinity, and network (Half-Weight Index HWI, preferred dyadic association tests, and Lagged Association Rates LAR), home ranges, residency patterns (Lagged Identification Rates LIR), and genetic relatedness. Analyses revealed four socially and spatially distinct, mixed-sex communities. The four communities had distinctive social patterns varying in strength, site fidelity, and residency patterns. Overlap in home ranges and relatedness explained little to none of the association patterns between individuals, suggesting complex local social structures. The study demonstrated that environmental impact assessments for mobile, continuously distributed species must evaluate impacts in light of local population structure, especially where proposed developments may affect core habitats of resident communities or sub-populations.

J,,,,,,,,,,,Welding processes used with Nickel-Aluminium Bronze components for service in the marine environment,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Awarded Grant,Sep 30 2019,2019,"Nickel-Aluminium Bronze (NAB) is widely used in seawater-contacting marine components such as external fixings, propellers and valves due to its good corrosion resistance and biofouling resistance. However, the development of welding processes that produce a favourable microstructure and mechanical properties in this alloy system is challenging, so welds in NAB are much more vulnerable to corrosion and Stress Corrosion Cracking (SCC) than the wrought material. This limits the maintainability of NAB parts and makes expensive replacement programmes necessary.In this project, the structural properties and corrosion resistance of NAB welds produced using different welding processes will be analysed, along with those of steel welds for comparison. NAB and steel welds will be exposed to marine environments while being simultaneously stressed and both the corrosion rate and community of biofouling organisms will be monitored. We will link this information to analysis of the material's final state via optical and electron microscopy and X-ray diffraction, and to results from mechanical tests which will be performed on welds post-exposure. This will enable us to identify welding processes which produce favourable weld microstructure and crystallographic in this material, to determine the dominant processes involved in NAB weld degradation, and to predict the effects of corrosion on the long-term structural integrity of NAB welds. During the environmental tests, we will also investigate the link between marine biofouling and corrosion damage. This will allow us to develop more practical, biologically-based corrosion inspection methods for marine welds.This work aligns with the Materials Engineering (Metals & Alloys) area of EPSRC's Manufacturing the Future theme. We will improve welding methods both for manufacturing NAB components and for NAB component repair by developing a greater understanding of how weld microstructures relate to corrosion-based degradation mechanisms. This will lead to economic benefits to operators of vessels and offshore structures, and to the UK marine maintenance industry. A direct practical outcome of this work will be to inform the welding processes used in Repair and Overhaul (R&O) by the industrial project partner Babcock International Group. It will also act as an enabling technology for the use of additive manufacturing (esp. Wire + Arc Additive Manufacturing) of NAB as an alternative to casting for creating complex-shaped components, which is currently under development by several major manufacturers. We also aim to link microstructure to biofouling for the first time, which will enable provide techniques for corrosion detection in NAB components, benefitting the safety and maintainability of offshore infrastructure",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,2267399,,,,,,,,University of Bristol,,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:15317310,,
J,,,,,,,,,"Star, Lisa",,RUI: Effects of Pre-Excavation Activities on the Performance of Urban Cofferdams,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Awarded Grant,Aug 01 2015,2015,"The recent tendency in urban excavations for high-rise buildings is the use of cofferdams which at times are responsible for the majority of the resulting ground movements. As a result of these projects, the allowable ground movements imposed by underground regulatory agencies have been drastically reduced, calling for improvements in the observational and analytical methods used in movement control plans. This award supports fundamental research on the methods of analysis and design of urban cofferdams and presents an opportunity for advances in soil-structure interaction behavior of deep excavations. Design recommendations considering the proposed effects in the performance of cofferdams do not currently exist in the United States. Two urban cofferdams serve as the test bed of this research: the first was built for a structure projected to be the tallest building in the United States, and to have the deepest basement ever built in the city where the structure was proposed; the second was built for the One Museum Park West building in Chicago, Illinois. The fundamental knowledge developed in this research will inspire new methods of analysis and design of offshore structures, deep foundations, wharfs, and retaining structures, and will advance the understanding of the soil-structure interaction in other types of geotechnical projects. Knowledge will be produced on the behavior of sheet pile interlocks in urban cofferdams under compression loading, the concrete material time-dependent effects on the behavior of cofferdams braced with reinforced concrete ring beams, and slippage and rotation at sheet pile interlocks for urban cofferdams braced with segmental steel ring beams. Three-dimensional fully-coupled flow-deformation numerical analyses of urban cofferdams using advanced constitutive soils models and incorporating the small strain behavior of soils will be used in the analyses. New design methodologies oriented for practice will be developed to incorporate the following factors into the design process: the material time-dependency of reinforced concrete ring beams, the structural compliance of steel ring beams and sheet piles, the slippage and rotation at sheet pile interlocks, and the installation of deep foundations and other structures inside of cofferdams. The ultimate goal of this research is to create more sustainable and resilient urban environments by preserving and protecting existing infrastructure, which is often compromised when excessive deformations occur.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,1538506,,,,,,,,California State University-Long Beach Foundation,California State University-Long Beach Foundation,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:13878199,,

With thousands of artificial structures present in the North Sea, we test the hypothesis that these structures are connected by water currents and act as an interconnected reef. Population genetic structure of the Blue mussel, Mytilus edulis was expected to follow a pattern predicted by particle tracking models (PTM). Correlation between population genetic differentiation, based on microsatellite markers, and particle exchange was tested. Specimens of M. edulis were found at each location, although the PTM indicated that locations >85 km offshore were isolated from coastal sub-populations. Fixation coefficient FST correlated with the number of arrivals in the PTM. However, the number of effective migrants per generation as inferred from coalescent simulations did not show a strong correlation with the arriving particles. Isolation by distance analysis showed no increase in isolation with increasing distance and we did not find clear structure among the populations. The marine stepping-stone effect is obviously important for the distribution of M. edulis in the North Sea and it may influence ecologically comparable species in a similar way. In the absence of artificial shallow hard substrates, M. edulis would be unlikely to survive in offshore North Sea waters. Although we found an indication that FST was lower between connected locations, isolation by distance analysis showed no increase in isolation with increasing distance. Finally, we did not find clear structure among the populations. Mytilus edulis population genetics Samples were collected at 27 locations (henceforth named sub-populations) between April 2014 and January 2016: from coastal sub-populations during low tide, by commercial and scientific divers from oil and gas platforms and wind farm foundations and during inspection, repair and maintenance work on buoys and offshore installations from structures lifted out of the water (Table 1, Figure 1). Sampling depth varied between 0 and 27 meters. Two likely outgroup sub-populations corresponding to peripheral populations of the species M. edulis (Denmark) and M. galloprovincialis (Portugal) were included; from a harbour in Lisbon, Portugal and from mussel longlines in the Limfjorden in Denmark. Geographic distances between sub-populations (excluding outgroups) varied from 17 km (Scheveningen and Q13-A) to 1,105 km (Blyth and Sylt) with an average of 348 km. Between 50 and approximately 100 individuals were sampled randomly at every location and stored at -20°C or in 70% ethanol to be transported to the laboratory. Then, all samples were cleaned of marine growth and placed at -80°C for long-term storage. Molecular methods From each sample, between 24 and 67 specimens were selected randomly and genomic DNA was isolated from the adductor muscles by using the 96 well genomic DNA extraction kit according to the manufacturers protocol (FAVORGEN Biotech Corp). DNA concentration was measured on a Nanodrop and diluted to 10 ng/mul. Two multiplex sets of four markers were used (set1: Med367, Med379, Med722 and Med733; set2: Med737, Med740, Med747 and Me15/16). Markers were used individually in the PCR, pooled per set and analysed on an ABI3730 DNA Analyser. Seven markers were microsatellite loci as described in Lallias et al. (2009) and the Me15/16 locus targeted a part of the adhesive protein gene which partially discriminates between M. edulis, M. galloprovincialis and M. trossulus (Inoue, Waite, Matsuoka, Odo, & Harayama, 1995). Marker information, PCR conditions and multiplex conditions are indicated in Table 2. The GeneScan 500 LIZ marker was used as internal marker. Allele calling was performed in Genemapper v3.7 (Applied Biosystems 2004). Connectivity calculated by particle tracking models The transport of mussel larvae between sampled sub-populations in the North Sea was modelled using two Delft3D software modules: FLOW and PART (Deltares, 2016b, 2016a). The PART module was able to simulate mid-field water quality and particle tracking, based on a hydrodynamic forcing output from the other Delft3D module, FLOW. Hydrodynamical model The hydrodynamical model applied was Delft3D-FLOW, which solves the unsteady shallow-water equations in three dimensions. The model incorporates a large number of processes, such as wind shear, wave forces, tidal forces, density-driven flows, stratification, atmospheric pressure changes, air temperature and the exposure and inundation of intertidal flats. The large number of processes included in this module means that Delft3D-FLOW can be applied to a wide range of environments (e.g. river, estuarine, coastal and marine areas; Lesser et al. 2004). Flow equations were solved on a curvilinear grid consisting of 8,710 computational elements (Roelvink, Jeuken, van Holland, Aarninkhof, & Stam, 2001). The vertical resolution of the model was ten water layers using a sigma-coordinated approach (i.e., proportional to water depth; Stelling and van Kester 1994). Hydrodynamic transport was computed using detailed bathymetry and open boundary forcing based on tidal constituents. The model was forced using meteorological data from the High Resolution Limited Area Model (KNMI, 2015), which comprised two horizontal wind velocity components (at 10 m above mean sea level) and other atmospheric variables such as air pressure and temperature, archived every 6 h. The freshwater discharges from 18 rivers were included in the model; seven of these discharges varied temporally (daily averages) and 11 were constant (based on long-term averages). This model is described in detail in Erftemeijer et al. (2009). Two grid lay-outs covering the southern North Sea (including the Wadden Sea) were used in this study: a moderately fine grid (ZUNOGROF) and a domain decomposition model grid (ZUNO-DD) with a much higher grid resolution in the Dutch coastal zone and the Wadden Sea. The subdomains of the ZUNO DD model are displayed in Figure 2 using different colours and are used to increase spatial resolution for hydrodynamic results in these areas. In coastal and inshore (estuarine, lagoonal) systems, the spatial variability in hydrodynamic forcing is much higher. To enable the simulation of these processes, the areas near the Dutch coast and in the Wadden Sea have been given a much higher horizontal grid density, so with smaller grid cells per surface unit. This provides for a much better simulation of the hydrodynamic processes in such areas. These spatial differences in resolution in the Dutch coastal waters and the Wadden Sea have been given a different colouring in Figure 2. Particle transport model Particle tracking models (PTM) are often used in environmental modelling (e.g., North et al. 2008; Broekhuizen et al. 2011; Postma et al. 2013). Here, the Delft3D-PART module was used to calculate larval transport across the southern North Sea. Delft3D-PART is a random walk particle tracking model, based on the principle that movement of dissolved substances in water can be described by a limited but potentially large number of discrete particles that are subject to advection due to currents and by horizontal and vertical dispersion. The movement of the particles in the model consists of two steps: advection, which is driven by the FLOW results, and dispersion, which is a stochastic random walk process. In addition, the horizontal and vertical movement of the particles can be adjusted to account for swimming preferences or changes in buoyancy. Particle tracking allows water quality processes to be described in a detailed spatial pattern, resolving sub-grid concentration distributions. Delft3D-PART is shown to be locally mass conservative (Postma et al., 2013). Modelling set up DELFT3D-FLOW calculated the hydrodynamic conditions for the southern North Sea for two consecutive years, 2004 and 2005. Meteorological conditions are important to determine the geographic destination of particles such as larvae, superimposed on the regular transport conditions in the southern North Sea. At the time of analysis, there were no hydrodynamic modelling results available for the years of sampling, 2014 to 2016. Instead, two model runs from 2004 and 2005 were used. Although there is large variation in climatic forcing between years, we chose these two years because of the overall comparable (southern) North Sea wind patterns during the months we used for PTM, i.e. March to June. The comparability especially regards wind directions and wind force. We could only roughly assess this comparability from meteorological data available to us (Royal Dutch Meteorological Institute); we did not do a detailed analysis. We assume that through this approach the differences between the hydrodynamic circulation patterns in the (southern) North Sea between these two periods is less than when random years would have been used. For the DELFT3D-PART model, each sampling location acted as an origin point of larvae and the density of the larvae throughout the consecutive months at the other locations (destinations) was calculated. Larval release was started at day 59 (1 March) of each year, from the top layer in the model. Both the timing and the period of particle release was based on the general reproductive timing and pelagic larval stage period of M. edulis. Mussels start spawning early spring, based on temperature of the water. Variation of spawning timing may result of the variation in temperature increase between years; in the southern North Sea this usually starts in March, and peaks in April/May or even later (De Vooys, 1999). Time from spawning of mussel larvae to settlement is around three months (Widdows, 1991). It was further assumed that the larvae are largely passive and that they are transported only by advection and general dispersion. They were also considered neutrally buoyant. Each origin released 1,489 particles per half hour, for 14 days (1,000,001 particles in total), after which no further release of particles occurred. The program calculated the horizontal transport and vertical dispersion to lower layers with time steps of 30 minutes for 70 days. Although mortality of M. edulis larvae is expected to be very high (Barker Jorgensen, 1981), this study did not include this aspect in the DELFT3D-PART model. The purpose of the study was to assess the maximum success of larvae settling at a specific destination, which was assumed to be proportional to the total number of larvae arriving at a specific destination throughout the 70 days. The total number of arriving particles from each source-destination combination was calculated and combined in a particle matrix. Data analysis Hybrid removal A mix of alleles of Mytilus galloprovincialis and M. trossulus were observed in our data at the partially species diagnostic locus Me15/16, and therefore we estimated the hybrid index h for each individual using a maximum likelihood approach that estimates the proportion of alleles inherited from one of two hybridizing species (Buerkle, 2005; Buerkle & Lexer, 2008). This approach was applied as implemented in the R package Introgress (Gompert & Alex Buerkle, 2010). The samples from Lisbon (M. galloprovincialis) and Limfjorden (M. edulis) were used as parental reference samples and locus Med379 was not taken into account due to high levels of missing data for several samples. All individuals identified as non-pure M. edulis (h < 1.0) were omitted from subsequent analyses, as this aspect would have affected the non-neutral influences on connectivity inferences. Isolation with migration analysis Effective gene flow between sampling locations was estimated for all possible pairs, using the coalescent approach implemented in the software 'Isolation with Migration' (IMa2p) (Hey & Nielsen, 2004; Sethuraman & Hey, 2016). The IMa2p model consists of subpopulations that are simulated backwards in time towards merging sometime in the past. Parameters for time since population divergence t, population sizes q and bidirectional migration rates m are estimated by a Metropolis-coupled Markov Chain Monte Carlo process. In order to not overfit the data we only ran simulations for pairs of samples. Coalescent simulation runs consisted of ten Markov Chain Monte Carlo chains with geometric heating (setting parameters ha = 0.99, hb = 0.75) and ten million steps after an initial burn-in period of five million steps. Parameters estimated and parameter ranges examined (in coalescent units) were three population sizes q (ancestral and two populations ensuing from population subdivision, range examined 0-100), two migration rates after population subdivision (both directions, range examined 0-1) and time since population subdivision t (range examined 0-10). Convergence of estimated parameter distributions was ensured by: checking effective sample size (ESS) values, autocorrelation values and chain swapping, examining trend line plots for absence of trends, and by comparing parameter estimates generated from the genealogies produced during the first and second half of runs. A mutation rate for the seven microsatellite loci of 0.001564 per generation was assumed, following the methodology by Luttikhuizen et al. (2018). Migration rates among sampled locations were visualised by chord diagrams using the R package Circlize version 0.4.3 (Gu, Gu, Eils, Schlesner, & Brors, 2014). The fit of the pairwise isolation-with-migration models to the data and the underlying processes was assessed by comparing the distribution of estimated migration rates with that of the pairwise FST values directly estimated from the microsatellite data. Pairwise FST values were converted to 2Nem values following the infinite island model approximation by Wright (Wright, 1943) in which FST = (1 + 4Nem)-1. Correspondence between 2Nem values stemming from FST estimation and from isolation-with-migration simulations was compared using Pearson rank correlation. Correlation was performed with the average between the two (bidirectional) migration rates stemming from isolation-with-migration simulations.

Protection of multi-terminal voltage source converters (VSC)-based HVDC transmission systems against DC faults is challenging. This paper presents a single-ended protection scheme for DC faults in a three-terminal VSC-HVDC transmission system. The under-voltage criterion is used to distinguish the DC faults from the transient and normal conditions. The rate of change of DC voltage and current as well as the variation of transient energy is used to discriminate the internal faults from the external faults. The DC fault current has very high value within a few milliseconds during the transient phases such as the capacitor discharging and diode freewheeling stages. Therefore, current limiting reactors are introduced in series with the DC circuit breaker to maintain the DC fault current within the breaker capacity. The single-ended protection scheme is tested with the three-terminal VSC-HVDC transmission system with current limiting reactors for various DC fault conditions. The DC fault data is generated from PSCAD/EMTDC simulation and the protection scheme is tested in MATLAB environment. Test results show that the proposed protection scheme gives reliable protection for the DC faults in a three-terminal VSC-HVDC transmission system.",,,,,,,,,8,0,0,0,0,0,8,,,1975-0102,2093-7423,,,,,,,,,,"Natl Inst Technol Karnataka, Dept Elect & Elect Engn, Mangalore, India",,,,2019-03-07,WOS:000459450800001,,

Total fish number was lowest in March at all the 3 sites when P. maximowiczi migrated to deeper and warmer waters. Assemblage equitability and species diversity also varied seasonally in accordance with the abundance fluctuation of P. maximowiczi. P. maximowiczi, Alcichthys alcicornis and Hexagrammos otakii were more abundant at the artificial reef and natural reef sites, while Dexistes rikuzenius and Hemitripterus villosus were more abundant at the sandy-mud bottom site; total fish abundance was largest at the artificial reef site mainly due to the large number of P. maximowiczi. Species richness was similar among sites, but equitability, and consequently species diversity, was lowest at the artificial reef site.

An artificial reef (AR) could be a tool for protecting or restoring these habitats and their declining biodiversity, and also help to enhance sustainable fisheries. The goal is to design non-polluting structures that best mimic the complexity of natural habitats in order to improve their service to the community. To date, the assessment of reef performance has been mostly focused on fish assemblages and species of ecological and/or socio-economic interest, and has disregarded the biofilm communities that determine the first level of an AR's trophic network. In this work, we used biofilm formation to compare the quality of substrates used as building parts for an AR, in order to optimize an eco-friendly material that will be used to design a new generation of ARs produced by giant 3D printers. The structure of the photosynthetic communities has been identified using pigment biomarkers and their production of exudates has been analysed. These polymeric substances were quantified in terms of total sugar and protein concentrations. They were further analysed in terms of amino acid content. We found no significant differences between the micro-algae communities developed on the different substrates. These photosynthetic communities were mainly composed of diatoms, prasinophytes, haptophytes, and dinoflagellates. However, we showed that the material for ARs is crucial for biofilm development, especially with regard to its secretions of sugar. The choice of an appropriate substrate for AR construction is thus of particular importance since biofilm secretions determine the organic substrate on which sessile macro-organisms will settle.",,,,,,,,,14,0,0,0,10,0,14,,,0925-8574,1872-6992,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Nice Sophia Antipolis, Univ Cote dAzur, CNRS, FRE ECOMERS 3729, Nice, FranceSorbonne Univ, Museum Natl Hist Nat, UMR BOREA 7208, CNRS,UCN,UA,IRD, Paris, FranceSorbonne Univ, Museum Natl Hist Nat, UMR MCAM 7245, Paris, FranceSorbonne Univ, Museum Natl Hist Nat, UMR BOREA 7208, CNRS,UCN,UA,IRD,Stn Biol Marine, Concarneau, France",,,,2018-10-03,WOS:000444614500027,,

Using South Georgia as a model location (where the history and geography of benthic biology is relatively well studied) we investigated whether the composition of functional groups were critical to benthic accumulation, immobilization and burial pathway to sequestration-and also aid their study through simplification of identification. We reclassified [1], [2]) morphotype and carbon mass data to 13 functional groups, for each sample of 32 sites around the South Georgia continental shelf. We investigated the influence on carbon accumulation, immobilization and sequestration estimate by multiple factors including the compositions of functional groups. Functional groups showed high diversity within and between sites, and within and between habitat types. Carbon storage was not linked to a functional group in particular but accumulation and immobilization increased with the number of functional groups present and the presence of hard substrata. Functional groups were also important to carbon burial rate, which increased with the presence of mixed (hard and soft substrata). Functional groups showed high surrogacy for taxonomic composition and were useful for examining contrasting habitat categorization. Functional groups not only aid marine carbon storage investigation by reducing time and the need for team size and speciality, but also important to benthic carbon pathways per se. There is a distinct geography to seabed carbon storage; seabed boulder-fields are hotspots of carbon accumulation and immobilization, whilst the interface between such boulder-fields and sediments are key places for burial and sequestration.",,,,,,,,,30,1,0,0,24,0,31,,,1932-6203,,,,,,,,,,,"British Antarctic Survey, Nat Environm Res Council, Cambridge, England",,,,2017-06-27,WOS:000404541500028,28654664,

Though some studies have apparently demonstrated that artificial reefs are capable of acting as production enhancers, others have not, for reasons which may be associated with the design of the reef itself. The review identifies a number of lines of enquiry for future research, and argues that while the proper design of a reef is essential to maximise productive potential, this may be of little value in the absence of a management strategy aimed at controlling the build-up of harvesting pressure which some reefs may engender.

Current industry approach is to design, manufacture, operate, and retire assets based on traditional methods, which typically rely on standards-based estimates, historical data/domain experience, physical examination, testing, monitoring, and inspection. This process is extremely time and resource intensive. Further, this process often does not consider the opportunity to use remanufacturing processes to extend/enhance product performance. Sentient technology will address these issues and fulfill the industry requirements. Phase II will expand the Phase I technology to include additional gearbox materials, damage modes and remanufacturing processes in a more comprehensive design and analysis framework capable of predicting optimal time-to-remanufacture and optimizing refurbishing operations to extend the useful life of components. This SBIR technology reduces physical testing using virtual testing, and will assist in remanufacturing of high value, high demand rotorcraft, automotive and wind turbine gearbox components. Hence, it decreases the energy, material resources, and costs associated with manufacturing, and ensures that the product performance is maintained/improved. The broader/commercial impact of the SBIR technology is within aerospace, energy, and transportation industries on high dollar assets that rely on the reliable function of highly engineered (and thus expensive) gearboxes. Our new Advanced Manufacturing partnership based application provides the US manufacturing supply chain a first mover and a sustainable competitive advantage greater than the 6% offshore labor rate advantage. This advantage comes through reuse of high value-added assets optimized for maximum lifetime use, coupled with decreased time and costs associated with traditional physical testing and analysis methods. This is possible based on the high-level of detail included in physics-based models, which (conceptually) decode material information at the microstructure level just as the Human Genome Project decodes genetic information at the DNA level. Our innovation enables the customer to rapidly, cost effectively, and accurately predict a product?s lifecycle (design, manufacture, operation, degradation, maintenance, repair/remanufacture, and retirement) at the material, component, and assembly/system scales. We foresee a future opportunity due to the fact that our innovation developed under this NSF grant will give us a competitive advantage of lower costs to provide the software and service. Our cost to deploy the technology is 10X lower than traditional companies in this space.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,1330900,,,,,,,,Sentient Corporation,Sentient Corporation,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:13947150,,

This paper focuses on investigating a tugboat's life cycle performance, specifically comparing different configurations of the propulsion system and selecting an optimal system with the lowest emissions release, costs and hazard impacts. A case study was carried out comparing five different engine configurations with the help of commercial and in-house developed life cycle assessment software in order to comprehensively evaluate the ship performance. Three main life phases, three evaluation flows, four emission categories and three criteria, were under consideration in this study. The results indicate LCA method and the in-house software could help to compare and determine optimal configurations and the engine configuration with three medium size engines is the optimal one which generated lowest emissions equivalent to 15.5 million euros, invested 14.2 million euros and occur a risk impact equivalent to 1.01 million euros. This paper not only provides a case study for the tugboat configuration assessment but also recommends LCA methodology as a general evaluation method for emission reduction technologies who have to meet the extreme requirements of emission control in the next few decades.

Simulation of the ecosystem parameters and potential reef distances as triangularly defined fuzzy sets generates input into the rules. Then, based upon the strength of belief in a rule, the artificial reef placement location can be accepted or rejected as being conducive to consumption at the reef and foraging behaviour of the species. Ease of utilisation of the model is highlighted by spreadsheet application to a red snapper (Lutjanus campechanus) ecosystem in Gulf of Mexico waters off the coastal shelf of Alabama.

Data from fishing surveys employing bottom long-lines were analysed to characterize the diversity, assemblages and distribution patterns of demersal fish along the Brazilian outer shelf and upper slope, between latitudes 13 degrees S and 22 degrees S.2. Non-metric multi-dimensional scaling (MDS) and cluster analysis indicate three distinct species assemblages separated primarily by depth (the 200m isobath) and secondarily by latitude (19 degrees S), suggesting a continual transition along the depth and latitudinal gradients in the study area. Species richness was negatively correlated with depth, but with no clear relationship with latitude.3. Results suggest the existence of reef formations on the shelf-edge zone (40-200 m) and slope down to 500m depth off the eastern Brazilian coast. More than 75% of the catches recorded were reef fish species from the families Serranidae, Lutjanidae, Malacanthidae, Muraenidae, Sparidae, Balistidae, Carangidae, Haemulidae, Scorpaenidae and Priacanthidae.4. The maximum depth of occurrence for 20 reef species was extended from limits previously recorded.5. The findings reinforce the hypothesis of a faunal corridor for species associated with deep reef formations along the shelf-edge zone (40-200 m), in the South American continental margin, connecting the south-western Atlantic and the Caribbean provinces.6. The shelf-edge reefs support important multi-species fisheries and harbour critical habitats for the life cycle of many reef fish species, including spawning aggregation sites that are extremely vulnerable to human pressures, such as intensive fishing, shipping and offshore oil and gas exploitation; all activities currently expanding off the Brazilian coast.7. Results reveal the biological importance of deep shelf-edge reefs as a critical ecological area. Despite their importance, shelf edge reefs are not currently included in any marine protected area network in the tropical south-western Atlantic. There is now an urgent need to enhance knowledge, implement adequate management strategies and consider these deeper habitats as priority areas for conservation.

Additionally, the attractive effect of two kinds of artificial reef models ( pyramid and cylinder reef models) on S. schlegelii was also studied. The results showed that S. schlegelii had different behavioral habits in early developmental stages. The post-larvae were scattered, whereas larvae and juveniles concentrated around the test tanks when there were no artificial reef models. When the two kinds of artificial reef models were introduced into the test tanks, there were no significant changes in the larval and post-larval average distribution rates in the central region of the tanks where the artificial reef models were placed ( P>0.05), but juveniles increased significantly from 1.11% to 47.78% and 54.44%, for pyramid and cylinder reef models, respectively ( P<0.01), indicating significantly increased attractive effects of the two kinds of models with the growth and development of the fish.

However, differences in multivariate community structure indicated that each habitat contained a distinct assemblage, with strongest difference between sheltered breakwaters and the exposed natural reef. All communities were characterized by marked seasonality; abundance and richness were generally higher in the warmer seasons (summer, fall) than during cooler periods (winter, spring), and there were related seasonal changes in community structure, particularly on the natural reef.

Here, we use carbon and nitrogen isotopes in tissues of biota from two offshore oil platforms to estimate the importance of phytoplankton and platform-associated macroalgae and epiphytic microalgae to the diets of platform-dwelling consumers. Although the consumption of macroalgae was indicated for small, mobile consumers including crabs, amphipods, and harpacticoid copepods, both a Bayesian mixing model and temporal changes in isotope composition identified phytoplankton as the most important basal resource for these consumers. Sessile suspension-feeding barnacles and oysters consumed phytoplankton and epiphytes, and probably redirected large amounts of pelagic production to other consumers. Secondary consumers including syllid polychaetes and the blennies, Molly Miller Scartella cristata and Tessellated Blenny Hypsoblennius invemar, exhibited a distinct contribution from epiphytes although large ranges in all potential basal resources were observed. Elemental and isotope analysis of the gut contents of individuals indicated that the nektonic Gray Triggerfish Balistes capriscus was omnivorous, directly consuming reef-derived macroalgae and epiphytes as well as animal tissue. Although we found that reef-derived resources entered benthic and nektonic food webs surrounding platforms, phytoplankton was the dominant basal resource fueling platform-dwelling communities at the time of our study, and no consumer studied specialized on a diet of red macroalgae. If these findings are generally representative, platform-derived benthic algae would not be integral to food-web function on artificial reefs, and reef function should be similar in areas both favorable to and unfavorable to in situ algal growth.",,,,,,,,,23,0,0,0,21,0,28,,,1942-5120,,,,,,,,,,,"Louisiana State Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Baton Rouge, LA 70803 USALouisiana State Univ, Dept Oceanog & Coastal Sci, Baton Rouge, LA 70803 USA",,,,2014-01-29,WOS:000329369900006,,

Shallow-water waves are defined as waves whose wavelengths are far greater than the water depth. Nonlinear wave interactions occur when waves, moving possibly with different speeds and in different directions, intersect. These equations and systems have permanent waves and breaking waves: the wave profile remains bounded, but its slope becomes unbounded in finite time. The CH and DP equations also contain peaked solitary waves, as these wave forms replicate a feature characteristic of the traveling wave solutions to the governing equations for largest possible amplitude. This project provides a greater understanding of wave breaking phenomena and contributes to the extensive modeling of shallow-water waves. Water waves lie at the forefront of modern applied mathematics and theoretical physics. The study of water wave phenomena has been a rich source of mathematical theories for over 200 years and affects a variety of issues pertaining to the ocean and environment. Breaking waves, both whitecaps and surf, are commonly observed in the ocean, but surprisingly, little is known about them. Yet they are important for a variety of reasons. They place large hydrodynamic loads on man-made structures, transfer horizontal momentum to surface currents, provide a source of turbulent energy to mix the upper layers of the ocean, and move sediment in shallow water. The investigator studies mathematical models of nonlinear shallow-water waves, particularly the CH and DP equations as well as the CH2 systems. The CH-type equations might also be relevant to the modeling of an important shallow-water breaking wave phenomenon, the tsunami. A tsunami wave is generated when a large body of water, such as a region in a lake or a sea, becomes rapidly displaced on a massive scale. With typical wavelengths of 200 km, tsunamis are governed by shallow water equations and can be catastrophic when they reach land, as seen in the recent Indonesia and Japan earthquakes. This project seeks further understanding of the dynamics of shallow-water wave breaking, especially before and after breaking has occurred when the flow is steady and more amenable to theoretical and numerical study. In particular, the investigator conducts mathematical analysis pertinent to the modeling of tsunami waves, which in turn helps better predict and understand the waves' characteristics.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,1207840,,,,,,,,University of Texas at Arlington,,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:13822083,,

As population continues to increase in coastal regions where the threat is highest, so does the possibility for greater disasters, as demonstrated by hurricanes Katrina, Ike, or Sandy. This risk can be devastating for entire communities, for the insurance industry, which ultimately must pay for a significant portion of the incurred losses, for local and state governments who have to struggle with the impact on their populations and economies, and for the nation as a whole. The implementation of affordable solutions to mitigate damage requires a quantification of the wind forces causing this destruction, and models that relate wind forces to the capacity of man-made structures to resist them. Full-scale measurements are required in order to calibrate and improve the models The proposed wireless multi-sensors network system has the capability of measuring pressure and temperature on a roof, collecting data (rate up to 1400 samples/s) and sending it to a server to process and publish on the web in nearly real-time. The focus of this proposal is to enhance the capabilities of prior innovation to characterize wind loads on full-scale residential structures during actual hurricanes. The deployment will leverage on the state-of-the-art in wireless sensors networks, cloud computing and social media to seamlessly manage and scale efficiently data streams as the velocity and volume of the source data grows unabated. In this proposal the team plans to add a smart data acquisition to the system which will allow faster data rates when the winds change fast and slower data rate when winds change slowly. This will help to avoid unnecessary data storage and economize the sensor duty cycle. The unique aspect of the system is it has not only the wireless and networking capabilities, but it also has several in-situ controls such as individual sensor remote control, self-negotiating communication, and excellent data throughput, precision, and accuracy; it is robust, reliable, and portable, and allows simultaneous deployment on multiple residences in case of a hurricane landfall.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,1535760,,,,,,,,Florida Institute of Technology,,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:13615061,,

The design concept is replicable and scalable in tropical waters throughout the world. It is one of the only viable approaches to making sustainable building materials at scale which also yields multiple marine biodiversity and climate change adaptation benefits.

Early projects used a cross-channel design and species-specific metrics (e.g., proximity to historical spawning locations) to guide reef placement. However, the Middle Channel Reefs and portions of other early projects were compromised by fine sediment accumulation. Therefore, geomorphological criteria were considered in siting reefs constructed after 2013 to avoid sediment sources and improve the likelihood of successful reef function. To evaluate the effectiveness of the revised placement process, we quantified physical maturation of constructed reefs using annual side-scan and down-looking sonar surveys beginning in 2014 and underwater video surveys beginning in 2015. Reef areas and hardness were measured from sonar surveys and underwater video was used to quantify surficial sediment composition. Size and hardness of reefs developed using geomorphological criteria decreased with time, but at rates slower than what was observed at the Middle Channel Reefs. Sediment composition of the reefs remained similar through 2017 and prevalence of reef rock was high, except at Hart's Light Reef, where dreissenid mussel shells composed 32% of the surficial substrate by age three. However, accumulation of fine sediments was documented at all reefs in 2018.

While protection of natural coastal habitat is recommended, balancing conservation with human services is now the challenge for managers. Marine infrastructure such as seawalls, marinas and offshore platforms is increasingly used to support and provide services, but has primarily been designed for engineering purposes without consideration of the ecological consequences. Increasingly developments are seeking alternatives to hard engineering and a range of ecological solutions has begun to replace or be incorporated into marine and coastal infrastructure. But too often, hard engineering remains the primary strategy because the tools for managers to implement ecological solutions are either lacking or not supported by policy and stakeholders. Here we outline critical research needs for marine urban development and emerging strategies that seek to mitigate the impacts of marine infrastructure.

Further, the lee of the outer breakwater provides a stable, quiet water area for numerous Young-of-Year (YOY) fishes. By means of SCUBA we monitored YOY abundance from 1986-1990. During these five years there were dramatic natural and anthropogenic disturbances of the habitat. With little inter-annual variation of upwelling or temperature, fluctuations were found in YOY abundances. Five species, Hypsypops rubicundus, Chromis punctipinnis, Girella nigricans, Heterostichus rostratus and Paralabrax clathratus are rocky reef species which exhibit interannual variations of YOY abundance corresponding to the various disturbances.

Experiments were performed to determine the impacts of crude oil, dispersed crude oil, and dispersant on the community structure and function of microorganisms in seawater (SW) and biofilms formed on carbon steel, a common ship hull construction material. Steel corrosion was also monitored to illustrate how oil spills may impact preservation of steel shipwrecks. Microcosms were filled with seawater (SW) and incubated at 4°C. Carbon steel disks (CSDs) were placed in each tank, and tanks were amended with crude oil and/or dispersant or no treatment. SW and CSD biofilms were sampled biweekly for genetic analysis using Illumina sequencing of 16S ribosomal RNA gene amplicons. Predicted and sequenced bacterial metagenomes were analyzed to examine impacts of oil and dispersant on metabolic function. Gammaproteobacteria, Alphaproteobacteria, and Flavobacteriia dominated SW and biofilms. Bacterial community structure differed significantly between treatments for SW and biofilms. OTUs affiliated with known (Pseudomonas) and potential (Marinomonas) hydrocarbon-degraders were roughly twice as abundant in biofilms treated with oil and dispersed oil, and steel corrosion of CSDs in these treatments was higher compared to control and dispersant treatments. OTUs affiliated with the Rhodobacteraceae family (biofilm formers and potential oil degraders) were less abundant in the dispersant treatment compared to other treatments in biofilm and SW samples, but OTUs affiliated with the Pseudoalteromonas genus (biofilm formers and proposed hydrocarbon degraders) were more abundant in dispersant-treated biofilms. Overall, functional gene analyses revealed a decrease in genes (predicted using PICRUSt and observed in sequenced metagenomes) associated with hydrocarbon degradation in dispersant-treated biofilms. This study indicates that exposure to oil and dispersant could disrupt the composition and metabolic function of biofilms colonizing metal hulls, as well as corrosion processes, potentially compromising shipwrecks as ecological and historical resources.

J,,,,,,,,,"McCartney, Michael",,Collaborative Research: Does larval transport or physiological tolerance set the southern range boundary of a northern blue mussel?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Awarded Grant,Mar 01 2010,2010,"Intellectual Merit This project will test whether the southern range boundary of a northern blue mussel, Mytilus trossulus, is determined by limitations on the dispersal of larvae, or the physiological tolerance of larvae and/or juveniles. Mytilus trossulus and its sister species, M. edulis, co-occur throughout the Canadian maritime provinces and the northern Gulf of Maine. While the abundance of M. trossulus decreases abruptly south of the Canadian border, M. edulis ranges south to North Carolina. Work to date has demonstrated that: 1) Adult M. trossulus in northeastern Maine inhabit coastal sites, islands, and man-made structures that are within the colder water of the Eastern Maine Coastal Current (EMCC). 2) Drifters released in the EMCC rarely enter nearshore waters to the south, suggesting that across-shelf transport is extremely limited. 3) Larvae of the two species may differ slightly in thermal tolerance, and some evidence suggests that tolerance may also be affected by nutritional status. 4) Mytilus trossulus juveniles transplanted within the northeastern Maine region, but outside of the EMCC, have high survivorship, while transplants further to the southwest suffer high mortality. In combination, these results suggest that larval transport sets the proximate range boundary within northeastern Maine (on a scale of 10 km), but thermal tolerance would ultimately limit the distribution on a larger spatial scale (200 km). This research project is designed to test this pair of hypotheses via a combination of field and lab experiments. Satellite drifters equipped with temperature loggers deployed in and out of the EMCC during the season of M. trossulus larval dispersal (mid-June to mid-August) will be used to quantify the physical flow fields and temperature regimes during larval dispersal. Drogues will allow us to assess whether larvae at different depths may experience different flow fields. Data from hydrographic surveys, combined with regular spatial and temporal sampling of mussel larvae and new settlers, will be used to assess possible associations between larval and post-settlement stages and different water masses. The physiological tolerance of new settlers will be assayed via transplants to sites in and out of the EMCC. Finally, laboratory growth and survival experiments will assay larval performance in different thermal and feeding regimes. The investigators will use molecular markers to identify the morphologically indistinguishable larvae and settlers of these sibling species. Broader Impacts This project will provide training for one MS and one PhD student, and several undergraduates. The PIs are at institutions that emphasize undergraduate and graduate research, and our project will provide numerous student opportunities for field and laboratory research in oceanography and benthic ecology. Such research opportunities are likely to attract a number of students who would otherwise pursue careers in biomedical research. The Gulf of Maine is home to a thriving Mytilis edulis aquaculture industry, and M. trossulus is a commercially inferior species ? growers are concerned about its possible spread. Hence a better understanding of the factors determining the range boundary of this species will help growers avoid M. trossulus spat. Results will be disseminated to enhance communication with the Maine aquaculture community. All of the fieldwork will be conducted in a region of Maine facing great educational challenges; teachers from area schools will be recruited to assist with summer field and laboratory work.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,961325,,,,,,,,University of North Carolina at Wilmington,University of North Carolina at Wilmington,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:13900952,,

However, uncertainties around the impacts of offshore wind on the environment, particularly marine birds, increase consent risk for future developments. Offshore wind farms are known to cause displacement of wintering red-throated divers (Gavia stellate), resulting in increased consent risk for projects planned for areas of high diver density. However, the consequences of this displacement at the individual and population level are unknown. Displacement is likely to increase energetic costs for divers but their ability to cope with these additional costs will depend on how energetically constrained they are. For the first time, energetics of red-throated divers is being investigated by the Red-throated Diver Energetics Project. Using time depth recorders and geolocators attached to red-throated divers on their breeding grounds, novel information on foraging behaviour of divers will be obtained. Divers are sensitive to disturbance and are a difficult species to work with, but the experience and expertise of ringers ensured all tags were successfully deployed. During the summer of 2018, a total of 74 red-throated divers were tagged. Breeding birds were caught either using a nest trap or a wader net. All birds were fitted with two tags, a time depth recorder and a geolocator tag, as well as a metal ring with a unique number. Altogether, 31 red-throated divers were tagged in southern Finland, 31 in Scotland and 12 in Iceland. In Iceland and Finland, approximately equal numbers of males and females were tagged, whereas there was a slight bias towards tagging females in Scotland. Sex was assigned according to biometrics. Red-throated divers had a poor breeding season in the Northern Isles, Scotland, with an average of 38% of nesting attempts producing a well grown chick, close to fledging. By contrast, 62% of nests in Finland fledged at least one chick. Given the sensitivity of divers to disturbance and the poor breeding season in Scotland, it was important to check that trapping divers did not affect their breeding success. Reassuringly, a comparison of breeding success for red-throated diver nests at which trapping of divers occurred and control nests with no trapping, showed no discernible effect of trapping on breeding success, in both Scotland and Finland. Tagged divers will be recaptured in 2019, tags removed and data downloaded and analysed. Additionally, breeding success and other data will be collected at nests where trapping occurs and at control sites, to investigate any effects on divers from carrying tags for a year and/or a second season of trapping. Analyses of data retrieved from the tags will reveal dive frequency, depth and duration for red-throated divers, enabling assessment of the proportion of time divers spend foraging throughout the year. Periods when divers spend longest foraging will indicate when they are most energetically challenged. This information will provide key evidence to understand the time of year when divers are least able to cope with additional energetic costs, which will provide insight into the potential consequences of displacing wintering red-throated divers.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,0963-8091,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2019-07-24,ZOOREC:ZOOR15508048256,,

In autumn and spring, soprano pipistrelles appear in areas where the species is not recorded during the summer. This also seems to be the case along other large Norwegian fiords (e.g. the fiord Hardangerfiorden in Hordaland county), but no banding effort has been made to confirm this (detector surveys only). Use of Sussex Auto bat (U.K) and puppet hair nets, automatic recording devices (batcorder system from EcoObs, Germany) and radio telemetry suggest that soprano pipistrelles will not undertake longer movements (e.g. to islands off the coast) in this region, but rather that this species avoid the extreme western parts with the strongest oceanic influence. This is also supported by records from bat boxes (Schwegler and BCI-type) over an east-west gradient.Whiskered bats Myotis mystacinus is rare or void in some oceanic sections of western Norway, but appear here in September. Daubenton's bats Myotis daubentonii can move from islands and to the mainland (one record), but on islands without freshwater habitats, no records of Myotis spp. has been made.The northern bat Eptesicus nilssonii is a very common species on the mainland and on large islands. On smaller islands it is void in summer, but appears there in autumn, even more that 10 km off the coast. Data from automatic recording devices show that the species may concentrate at the end of headlands in autumn and movements off to sea here is a possibility.With minimum effort, rare species such as the parti-coloured bat Vespertilio murinus, have been recorded on islands in autumn and not in summer, suggesting at least some movements of this species along the coast in western Norway. A single record of a serotine bat Eptesicus serotinus has been made at one island of the coast of western Norway (2 September 2011, on the island Vigra, Giske municipality, More og Romsdal county, 62 degrees 32' N 06 degrees 00' E). The ultrasound recording was determined to species by Ingemar AHLEN, Hans J. BAAGOE and Kjell ISAKSEN (all with knowledge of the site where the recording was made). The status of the latter species in Norway is uncertain. It may be a ship assisted individual or there may be a small undetected population. Too little effort has been made to map species in much of western Norway to exclude the existence of populations of this species here.Some records of the Nathusius' pipistrelle Pipistrellus nathusii have been made on oil installations in Norwegian territories and one such record is reported here from the Troll oil field in the North Sea in Norwegian territory in May 2011. This bat landed on a support ship and was released when the ship returned to mainland Norway. A noctule Nyctalus noctula has been confirmed from one island of the coast during migration season and possible noctules have been found on oilrigs in the North Sea.Even though a member of Eurobats (since 1994), responsible government authorities in Norway does not direct companies building wind farms to include bats in environmental impact assessments (eg. as recommended in Eurobats Publication series no. 3), thus bats does not receive any meaningful attention in plans to erect windmills. Several such projects are now being realized without any knowledge about the possible effect on bat populations and without any knowledge about which species can be found in these project areas.

Journal of Coastal Research, SI 50 (Proceedings of the 9th International Coastal Symposium), 731 - 737. Gold Coast, Australia, ISSN 0749.0208Sandbanks are an important coastal resource, both in terms of the activities that occur on them (e.g., dredging, offshore wind farms) as well as the direct and indirect effects they can have on adjacent beaches. Due to the large temporal and spatial domains that sandbanks occupy, there have been relatively few investigations that examine bank behaviour and impacts on other sedimentary bodies (beaches and other banks). Navigation charts near historical ports can yield long datasets for sandbank analysis; however large time intervals and gaps in the data make it difficult to distinguish trends from cycles and gradual from episodic behaviour.In this paper we assemble a new 182-year historical dataset that has significant improvements in data density and temporal coverage (i.e., fewer gaps and smaller time intervals) and permits a more detailed investigation of patterns in bank behaviour. The sandbank exhibits 70-80 year cyclical behaviour in its movement, volume and elevation and holds two distinct and associated morphological states (deltaic and elongate). Annual bathymetry shows gradual bank migration is common to both morphologies but bank reconfiguration (elongate <-> deltaic) occurs rapidly (relative to the cycle period), on a bank-wide scale and may be considered to be episodic. The switch from deltaic to elongate morphology is hypothesised to result from upstream morphology-tide interactions induced by changes in the shape or position of other banks.The cyclical nature of bank elevation, extent, proximity to shore and shape has important implications for adjacent beaches as variation in sandbank characteristics alters the transmission and alongshore distribution of wave energy (through refraction and dissipation of wave energy by breaking). The latter controls net longshore sediment transport and therefore erosion/accretion trends. Bank-beach interactions are shown to be complex; high bank elevations, which can provide the greatest coastal protection by reducing wave energy incident to the shoreline, are actually associated with the most severe erosion in the historical record. To further elucidate bank beach relations, current field and numerical modelling efforts examine the direct (sediment exchange) and indirect (refraction, dissipation) linkages between bank and beach behaviour.",,,,,,,,,18,0,0,0,2,0,18,,,0749-0208,1551-5036,,,,,,,,,,"Univ E Anglia, Sch Environm Sci, Norwich NR4 7TJ, Norfolk, EnglandCEFAS, Lowestoft NR33 OHT, Suffolk, England",,,,2007-01-01,WOS:000207860300137,,

These communities represent a critical component of estuarine food webs and frequently include juveniles of ecologically and economically important species that utilize oyster reefs as nurseries. Oyster-related metrics are commonly used to quantify restoration success, yet it is also important to examine communities of oyster-associated organisms when attempting to identify ecological convergence between natural and restored oyster reefs. Here, we compare the community composition of motile benthic organisms over time at one restored and three natural oyster (Crassostrea virginica) reefs in the Loxahatchee River estuary (Florida, USA) as one means of assessing restoration success. We also examine the effects of vertical relief on motile benthic organisms following restoration. The community of motile benthic organisms at the 1.93-ha restoration reef gradually began to resemble natural communities in the months following reef construction. Within similar to 22 months, biomass and community composition were similar between natural and restored habitats. At that point, the mean biomass of motile benthic organisms at the restoration site had reached 83.6 g/m(2) (versus 89.8 g/m(2) at nearby natural reefs), and the restored reef supported >1600 kg of small, motile, oyster-associated organisms. Biomass values increased more rapidly in high-relief sections of the restored reef (30 cm vs. 15 cm reef height), particularly during the first year following restoration. High-relief areas were also characterized by increased oyster densities, greater oyster-generated rugosity. and decreased sedimentation. Our findings suggest that small differences in reef design can have important implications for restoration success as well as food web structure and dynamics via shifts in community composition.

First, a cube-type AR was selected because of its typical free-fall installation procedure, its facilitate volume (67.4%) in Korean coastal waters, and accumulated statistics showing severe seabed settlement. Second, numerical flow analyses were carried out to estimate the terminal velocities and distances of the AR in water.

Since 1982 this index has been obtained from monthly sampling of concrete artificial reefs in a nursery area in the Gulf of Batabano, A significant relationship was obtained between the index for juveniles and catch in the next year (r = 0.8301, P<0.001).",,,,,4th International Workshop on Lobster Biology and Management4th International Workshop on Lobster Biology and Management,"JUL 25-31, 1993JUL 25-31, 1993",,"KITASATO UNIV, SCH FISHERIES SCI, SANRIKU, JAPANKITASATO UNIV, SCH FISHERIES SCI, SANRIKU, JAPAN",20,0,0,0,14,1,23,,,0011-216X,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1995-03-01,WOS:A1995QK86800013,,

The results showed that TN in marine ranching areas were accumulated with the presence of artificial reefs and the cultivation of mussels and seaweeds. TN were increased from 266.62mg/kg in 2010 to 596.21mg/kg in 2015. The high abundance of phytoplankton promoted the release of available phosphorus in sediments that collected from marine ranching and control areas. The concentration of TN in marine ranching area were decreased from 547.26mg / kg in 2010 to 317.25mg/kg in 2015, while the values were decreased from 438.21mg/kg in 2010 to 342.97mg/kg in 2015in the control area.

The effect of zoobenthos on the nutrient exchange flux at the sediment-water interface has been determined not the dominant factor for variation of concentrations of TN and TP. The DIN in marine ranching area was susceptible to be TN. PO43--N in the control areas was consistent with the change of TP in sediments.

It comprises nine volcanic Small Islands (SIs) scattered over 600 km and are vulnerable to coastal hazards due to limited land availability and ocean exposure. To mitigate and adapt to hazards and human occupation, traditional hard-engineering structures have been used. However, these structures have negative impacts on natural coastal character and amenity value and with growing environmental awareness, soft-engineering solutions designed to work with natural processes, such as multifunctional artificial reefs (MFARs), are globally becoming more appealing. MFARs are offshore submerged structures which provide coastal protection while enhancing marine and recreational amenities such as surfing, diving and beach widening. This paper determines optimal MFAR multifunctional design criteria based on current progress and assessment of nine international MFARs installed to-date. It subsequently explores MFAR feasibility in Sao Miguel Island, the biggest and most populated Azorean Island with the largest surfing population. An assessment of surf breaks was undertaken, including coastal processes and retreat rates, and MFAR site selection, criteria and rationale are discussed. By considering site-specific parameters such as local bathymetry, wave climate, tides, coastal processes and marine environment alongside tourism potential and surf culture, Sao Roque reef was selected as a potential MFAR to provide both coastal protection and surfing amenity.

For ARs to function as substitute habitat for degraded natural reefs, they should perform as dose as possible to local natural reefs, however this is seldom investigated. Here we evaluated the performance of new custom-designed reef structures (CDARs) as fish habitat. As a benchmark for their success, we compared fish abundance, diversity and community composition on CDARs to another commonly used AR type (Reef Balls (RBs)) and nearby natural reefs. Fish were monitored on all reef types over two recruitment seasons at three locations in Port Phillip Bay, Australia. Overall, there were no consistent differences in fish density among reef types, although densities on both AR designs were markedly lower than natural reefs at some locations. However, fish species richness on the CDARs was, on average, 2x higher than natural or RB reefs. There were large dissimilarities in fish community composition among reef types across all locations and years. These dissimilarities declined over time with the CDARs becoming more similar to natural communities than to RB reefs. Our results suggest that CDARs can play a role in reef fish conservation where natural reefs are under threat, supporting natural community structure and enhancing local biodiversity. Overall, our findings suggest that la cation of deployment, rather than design, has a more significant influence on fish abundances on ARs, whereas reef design is an important determinant of species diversity and community structure irrespective of location. ARs represent an important management tool for enhancing fisheries productivity and conservation in areas where reef habitat has been degraded or lost. However, failure to incorporate consideration of reef location and design into future AR deployments may lead to poor performance and failure to achieve restoration or conservation goals.

However, these may be difficult to obtain for mobile species, especially colonial central-place foragers (CCPFs; e.g., bats, corvids, social insects), because it is often impractical to determine the provenance of individuals observed beyond breeding sites. Moreover, some CCPFs, especially in the marine realm (e.g., pinnipeds, turtles, and seabirds) are difficult to observe because they range tens to ten thousands of kilometers from their colonies. It is hypothesized that the distribution of CCPFs depends largely on habitat availability and intraspecific competition. Modeling these effects may therefore allow distributions to be estimated from samples of individual spatial usage. Such data can be obtained for an increasing number of species using tracking technology. However, techniques for estimating population-level distributions using the telemetry data are poorly developed. This is of concern because many marine CCPFs, such as seabirds, are threatened by anthropogenic activities. Here, we aim to estimate the distribution at sea of four seabird species, foraging from approximately 5,500 breeding sites in Britain and Ireland. To do so, we GPS-tracked a sample of 230 European Shags Phalacrocorax aristotelis, 464 Black-legged Kittiwakes Rissa tridactyla, 178 Common Murres Uria aalge, and 281 Razorbills Alca torda from 13, 20, 12, and 14 colonies, respectively. Using Poisson point process habitat use models, we show that distribution at sea is dependent on (1) density-dependent competition among sympatric conspecifics (all species) and parapatric conspecifics (Kittiwakes and Murres); (2) habitat accessibility and coastal geometry, such that birds travel further from colonies with limited access to the sea; and (3) regional habitat availability. Using these models, we predict space use by birds from unobserved colonies and thereby map the distribution at sea of each species at both the colony and regional level. Space use by all four species' British breeding populations is concentrated in the coastal waters of Scotland, highlighting the need for robust conservation measures in this area. The techniques we present are applicable to any CCPF.",,,,,,,,,78,1,0,0,67,0,86,,,1051-0761,1939-5582,,,,,,,,,,"RSPB, Ctr Conservat Sci, Sandy SG19 2DL, Beds, EnglandUniv Glasgow, Inst Biodivers Anim Hlth & Comparat Med, Graham Kerr Bldg, Glasgow G12 8QQ, Lanark, ScotlandRSPB Scotland, RSPB Ctr Conservat Sci, Etive House,Beechwood Pk, Inverness IV2 3BW, ScotlandBirdWatch Ireland, 20D Bullford Business Campus, Kilcoole, County Wicklow, IrelandCtr Ecol & Hydrol, Bush Estate, Penicuik EH26 0QB, Midlothian, ScotlandUniv Liverpool, Sch Environm Sci, Nicholson Bldg,Brownlow St, Liverpool L69 3GP, Merseyside, EnglandUniv Oxford, Dept Zool, Oxford Nav Grp, South Parks Rd, Oxford OX1 3PS, EnglandJoint Nat Conservat Comm, Inverdee House,Baxter St, Aberdeen AB11 9QAUNI, ScotlandPlymouth Marine Lab, Plymouth PL1 3DH, Devon, EnglandUniv Roehampton, Life Sci Dept, Whitelands Coll, London SW15 4JD, EnglandUniv Exeter, Environm & Sustainabil Inst, Falmouth TR10 9EZ, England",BirdWatch IrelandJoint Nat Conservat Comm,,,2017-10-01,WOS:000412080200007,28653410,

To determine diets and degree of prey selection we analyzed gut contents of lobsters (Homarus americanus Milne-Edwards), two species of crabs (Cancer irroratus Say and C. borealis Stimpson) and 13 fish species of which pollock (Pollachius virens (Linnaeus)), cunners (Tautogolabrus adspersus (Walbaum)), and sculpins (several species) were the most conspicuous species of this assemblage. Dietary data were compared with those on benthic prey availability. In the laboratory, we conducted experiments to test whether there is prey selection in relation to their energetic value. In the field, we conducted two experiments: (1) to test whether fish predators move into the intertidal zone during high tide for feeding purposes; and (2) to test the impact of increased predator abundance in these communities using artificial reefs made of concrete blocks.Large fish and crustacean predators foraged both benthic (mainly invertebrates) and pelagic (mostly fishes) prey. Juveniles or small individuals of crustaceans, mollusks and fish were the most heavily preyed, crabs (Cancer spp.), mussels (Mytilus edulis Linnaeus), and herring (Clupea harengus Linnaeus) being the most common items. Juvenile sea urchins (Strongylocentrotus droebachiensis (Muller)) were important prey of cunners. In the laboratory, lobsters, cunners and sculpins exhibited strong preference for small crabs and mussels but not for echinoderms. These results were consistent with those obtained with a prey selection index, and were closely related to the energy value of prey, suggesting that these predators behave as energy maximizers.13 pollock and four cunners were caught in the mid-intertidal zone. These specimens contained a variety of undigested benthic intertidal organisms indicating that they utilize intertidal zones as feeding grounds. These results suggest that fishes may play an important role on the structure and organization of intertidal sessile communities. A significant number of predators colonized the artificial reefs, indicating that the availability of living space is an important factor affecting the distribution and abundance of large mobile predators. These predators reduced the abundance of juvenile or small benthic species, particularly of green sea urchins, in the area surrounding the reefs, suggesting that size-selective predation is presumably the mechanism by which predators influence the structure and organization of benthic communities in these environments.",,,,,,,,,113,0,0,0,72,4,125,,,0022-0981,1879-1697,,,,,,,,,,"UNIV MAINE, DEPT ZOOL, ORONO, ME 04473 USA",,,,1991-01-01,WOS:A1991FW13800002,,

Reefs were divided into three regions (east, central, west) across an east to west gradient of increasing reef complexity and salinity. Gray triggerfish (Balistes capriscus) primarily consumed reef-associated prey (xanthid crabs, bivalves, barnacles) and pelagic gastropods, while red snapper (Lutjanus campechanus) diets were mainly comprised of non-reef prey (stomatopods, fishes, portunid crabs). Natural stable isotopes of carbon (d13C), nitrogen (d15N), and sulfur (d34S) were measured in consumer muscle tissue as well as potential primary producers. Gray triggerfish occupied a lower trophic position than red snapper, with lower d13C and d15N values across all size classes and regions, and generally higher d34S values. Red snapper had a smaller range of stable isotope values and corrected standard ellipse areas across all size classes and regions, indicating a smaller isotopic niche. Contribution estimates of particulate organic matter (26 to 54 %) and benthic microalgae (BMA, 47 to 74 %) for both species were similar, with BMA contributions greater across all three size classes (juveniles, sub-adults, adults) of red snapper and all but the juvenile size class for gray triggerfish. Species gut contents and stable isotopes differed by region, with fishes consuming more crabs in the east region and more gastropods in the central and west regions. d13C and d15N values generally decreased from east to west, while d34S increased across this gradient. Results highlight species-specific feeding differences associated with artificial reefs, where gray triggerfish may be more dependent on the reef structure for foraging opportunities. In addition, results offer further information on the integral role of BMA in primary production at nearshore artificial reefs.

The females were then killed and their gonads examined for sexual stage and fecundity determination. Fecundity was inversely correlated to the spatial complexity of the environment whereas oocyte size tented to increase together with spatial complexity. Females placed in tanks with artificial reefs presented a lower fecundity and reproductive investment and bigger oocytes than those maintained in the bare bottom tanks. Fish reared in tanks with a sandy bottom had intermediate reproductive traits. The response of females to changes in the spatial structure of their environment was observed after only one or two reproductive cycles, providing the first experimental evidence of such rapid phenotypic adaptation to environmental complexity.

Near-bottom, biological surveys were conducted at a petroleum platform located in 305 m water depth off the coast of Louisiana between 268 m and the seabed. Surveys were performed with a remotely operated vehicle (ROV) and consisted of replicated benthic transects on all four sides of the platform extending 125 m outward from the platform. The fouling community on hard surfaces of the horizontal cross-members and verticals were surveyed using HD video and digital still images. Relative abundances of fishes were estimated using digital still images collected at regular intervals under three illumination regimes: no light, red light, and white light, while the ROV hydraulics were switched off to reduce vehicle noise. Additional surveys of fishes were conducted during day and night at the platform and at two far-field sites located 2 km and 3 km from the platform by monitoring species attracted to buckets containing an olfactory attractant. The results indicated abundant coldwater coral Lophelia pertusa present on the platform and on the surrounding rubble near the platform.

The fish community at the farfield site was substantially different and less diverse than that observed at the platform and was dominated by king snake eels (Ophichthys rex) and Scorpaenidae.

Two of the dominant emissions of offshore oil and gas production to the marine environment are the discharge of produced water and drilling waste. Although environmental impacts of produced water are predominantly due to chemical stressors, a major concern regarding drilling waste discharge is the potential physical impact due to particles. At present, impact indicators for particulate emissions are not yet available in life cycle assessment. Here, we develop characterization factors for 2 distinct impacts of particulate emissions: an increased turbidity zone in the water column and physical burial of benthic communities. The characterization factor for turbidity is developed analogous to characterization factors for toxic impacts, and ranges from 1.4 PAF (potentially affected fraction) . m(3)/d/kg(p) (kilogram particulate) for drilling mud particles discharged from the rig. The characterization factor for burial describes the volume of sediment that is impacted by particle deposition on the seafloor and equals 2.0 x 10 (1) PAF . m(3)/d/kg(p) for cutting particles. This characterization factor is quantified on the basis of initial deposition layer characteristics, such as height and surface area, the initial benthic response, and the recovery rate. We assessed the relevance of including particulate emissions in an impact assessment of offshore oil and gas production. Accordingly, the total impact on the water column and on the sediment was quantified based on emission data of produced water and drilling waste for all oil and gas fields on the Norwegian continental shelf in 2008. Our results show that cutting particles contribute substantially to the total impact of offshore oil and gas production on marine sediments, with a relative contribution of 55% and 31% on the regional and global scale, respectively. In contrast, the contribution of particulate emissions to the total impact on the marine water column is of minor importance. We conclude that particles are an important stressor in marine ecosystems, particularly for marine sediment, and particulate emissions should therefore be included in a (life cycle) impact assessment of offshore oil and gas production.

All devices were provided with a polyethylene floating rope 8 mm in diameter that served as a collector for egg deposition. Total rope length was 1,440 m in SC (2,880 segments of 0.5 m), 250 m in LC (500 segments of 0.5 m), and 250 m in TC (10 m per trap). Although the sites where SC and LC were deployed were sheltered from the action of destructive fishing gears, heavy winter storms destroyed the SC after a year. Most recreational fishermen and none of the professional fishermen provided detailed information on percent egg coverage on their collectors. The collectors attached to the three devices proved highly suitable for cuttlefish spawning, collecting more than 500,000 eggs on 2,440 m of rope.

The removal sites had higher concentrations of many contaminants than reef or control sites, but lower concentrations than platform sites. Reduced meiobenthic abundances and altered Harpacticoida community structure were primarily a function of reef effects, not contaminant effects. The habitat influence is likely a result of complex ecological interactions near platforms. The reef effect appears to be important in controlling meiofauna near platforms where contaminants are low because of drilling and production techniques used in the Gulf of Mexico.

According to the distance to the boundary of the fish cages, 6 points were selected as sampling stations: 2 at the fish cages, 2 near the boundary of the fish culture area, and 2 reference sites further away from the culture area. Bimonthly sediment samples were collected for analysis of silt-clay fraction (SCF), moisture content (MC), total organic carbon (TOC), total Kjeldahl nitrogen (TKN) and total phosphorus (TP). The macrobenthos (>0.5 mm) present in the sediment were sorted, identified and enumerated. TOC, TKN and TP levels at the fish cage stations were consistently higher than those at the reference stations over the 1-year pre-AR and 2-year post-AR deployment monitoring period. The diversity of macrofauna was significantly reduced at the fish cage stations relative to the reference sites. The intermediary stations near the fish culture area showed a transitional state of disturbance. Over the 2-year post-AR deployment period, TOC, TKN and TP showed a decreasing trend at the fish cage and intermediary stations. More diverse macrofaunal communities were recorded at the fish cage stations, with species diversity H'increasing from 0-1 at the beginning of the AR deployment to H' > 2 at the end of the study. The present results demonstrated that artificial reefs can improve the benthic abiotic environment and biotic conditions beneath fish rafts which are deteriorated due to farming activities.

However, the approach was designed to assess ecosystem impacts of offshore fisheries, and so it considers only the impacts of fishing on marine ecosystems and fisheries resources. This study is to extend the EBFA approach for inshore or coastal ecosystems, which have a variety of impacts due to a number of anthropogenic activities other than fishing. These activities cause significant impacts on inshore ecosystems and their fisheries resources, which include various kinds of impacts from multiple driving forces such as 1) aquaculture, 2) stock enhancement activities, 3) land-based wastes and pollution, 4) inshore construction activities, 5) leisure activities like sport fishing and scuba diving, 6) accidents and disasters like oil spills, climate changes and fluctuations, harmful algal blooms and jellyfish attacks, and 7) other man-caused factors like artificial reefs input, stocking fries and juveniles, constructing marine forests and marine ranches etc. We attempted to develop a revised version of EBFA. A number of indicators for assessing impacts of those driving forces were developed in this study. However, relevant reference points for the indicators have not been fully developed yet. Practical applications seem to be far off due to the lack of knowledge and information for assessing risks of some indicators, and thus further research, especially on the reference points, is required to assess all relevant impacts to marine ecosystems.",,,,,12th International Conference on the Mediterranean Coastal Environment (MEDCOAST)12th International Conference on the Mediterranean Coastal Environment (MEDCOAST),"OCT 06-10, 2015OCT 06-10, 2015","Mediterranean Coastal Fdn; Inst Oceanol; Inst Fish Resources; Republ Turkey, Promot FundMediterranean Coastal Fdn; Inst Oceanol; Inst Fish Resources; Republ Turkey, Promot Fund","Varna, BULGARIAVarna, BULGARIA",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,978-605-85652-3-4,,,,,,,,,"Pukyong Natl Univ, Busan 608737, South KoreaKorea Res Inst Ships & Ocean Engn, Daejeon 305343, South Korea",,,,2016-07-06,WOS:000377577200046,,

This nutrient loading increased nearly 300% since 1950, primarily due to increased use of agricultural fertilizers. Over this same time period, the red snapper (Lutjanus campechanus) population in the Gulf of Mexico has shifted strongly from being dominated by the eastern Gulf of Mexico to being dominated by the northern and western Gulf of Mexico, with the bulk of the current population in the same regions with significant nutrient loading from the Mississippi and Atchafalaya rivers and in or near areas with development of mid-summer hypoxic zones. The population decline of red snapper in the eastern Gulf is almost certainly attributable to overfishing, but the cause of the population increase in the northern and western Gulf is subject to broad debate, with the impact of artificial reefs (primarily oil platforms which have incr eased greatly since the 1960s) being the most contentious point. Nutrient loading has been shown to positively impact secondary production of fish in many marine systems. The present paper offers the hypothesis that increased nutrient loading has contributed significantly to increased red snapper population in the northern and western Gulf of Mexico. Nutrient loading may be working in synergy with the abundant oil platforms both increasing primary production and providing structure encouraging red snapper to feed throughout the water column.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2022-11-15,PPRN:22645426,,

Emphasis was placed on determining spatial and temporal patterns in habitat utilization by fishes on an offshore artificial reef(Mobil Platform HI-A389A). Overall, 43 species were observed during diurnal surveys in the upper 24 m of the artificial reef Midwater pelagic fishes (i.e., carangids and scombrids) accounted for over 50% of all taxa enumerated on the artificial reef; however, these taxa were transient members of the assemblage and were observed infrequently. Labrids, pomacentrids, and serranids were the dominant reef-dependent taxa. Distinct trends in vertical, diel, and seasonal abundances were observed for juvenile and adult fishes. Of the three designated depth zones (upper 1.5-9.0, middle 9.0-16.5; lower 16.5-24.0 m), abundance and species diversity were lowest in the upper zone. Nocturnal counts were characterized by a marked reduction or complete absence of most species, due in part to twilight cover-seeking and movement activities. Seasonal variation in community composition and species abundance (May versus September) was primarily due to recruitment of juveniles (0-age fishes) to the artificial reef in late summer. Increases in total fish abundance (all taxa combined) coincided with both increasing habitat rugosity and degree of fouling. Species richness on natural coral reefs in the FGBNMS was higher than on the artificial reef.

There are 186 villages in Bulgaria in which there are no longer any inhabitants, which is a very serious economic and social problem. The depopulation of the countryside has led to massive financial losses in the absorption of the EU funds. That is why the state should intervene and devise policies for the development of villages. 2) There are possibilities for combating this problem in the application of alternative environmental energy sources - solar panels for electricity and for heating water using wind and thermo generators, biomass heating, etc. Bulgaria is one of the fastest growing markets for wind energy worldwide. There are already several wind farms in Dobrudzha and sea-experience that would be of particular interest to Latvia, where the wind is a convertible commodity all the year round. There are unique inventions patented by Bulgarian scientists, for example, the thermo-photovoltaic CHP of the researcher Georgi Tonchev. The European Wind Energy Association states that by 2020 Bulgaria will be ready to expand its energy production from wind up to 3,000 megawatts, covering more than 13 % of the total electricity consumption in the country. The European Union will provide grants to 58 municipalities for energy efficient projects. 3) The paper focuses also on energy policies and interests, the protests against shale gas production in 12 Bulgarian towns, on the passiveness of the institutions and the media, underestimating the chances of reviving the Bulgarian village and the opportunities to attract foreign investment and to reduce household bills. The methodology used in the paper is based on the case studies approach, content analysis of the Bulgarian media materials and the study of demographic statistics.

Key uncertainties were identified and the effect of future impacts on the carbon budget were assessed. The water of the shelf seas contains between 210 and 230 Tmol of carbon and absorbs between 1.3 and 3.3 Tmol from the atmosphere annually. Off-shelf transport and burial in the sediments account for 60-100 and 0-40% of carbon outputs from the NWES, respectively. Both of these fluxes remain poorly constrained by observations and resolving their magnitudes and relative importance is a key research priority. Pelagic and benthic carbon stocks are dominated by inorganic carbon. Shelf sediments contain the largest stock of carbon, with between 520 and 1600 Tmol stored in the top 0.1 m of the sea bed. Coastal habitats such as salt marshes and mud flats contain large amounts of carbon per unit area but their total carbon stocks are small compared to pelagic and benthic stocks due to their smaller spatial extent. The large pelagic stock of carbon will continue to increase due to the rising concentration of atmospheric CO2, with associated pH decrease. Pelagic carbon stocks and flows are also likely to be significantly affected by increasing acidity and temperature, and circulation changes but the net impact is uncertain. Benthic carbon stocks will be affected by increasing temperature and acidity, and decreasing oxygen concentrations, although the net impact of these interrelated changes on carbon stocks is uncertain and a major knowledge gap. The impact of bottom trawling on benthic carbon stocks is unique amongst the impacts we consider in that it is widespread and also directly manageable, although its net effect on the carbon budget is uncertain. Coastal habitats are vulnerable to sea level rise and are strongly impacted by management decisions. Local, national and regional actions have the potential to protect or enhance carbon storage, but ultimately global governance, via controls on emissions, has the greatest potential to influence the long-term fate of carbon stocks in the northwestern European continental shelf.",,,,,,,,,61,0,0,0,32,0,63,,,,2296-7745,,,,,,,,,,"Univ East Anglia, Ctr Ocean & Atmospher Sci, Sch Environm Sci, Norwich, Norfolk, EnglandCtr Environm Fisheries & Aquaculture Sci, Lowestoft, Suffolk, EnglandBantry Marine Res Stn, Bantry, IrelandUniv Essex, Sch Life Sci, Colchester, Essex, EnglandGeol Survey Norway, Trondheim, NorwayPlymouth Marine Lab, Plymouth, Devon, EnglandScottish Assoc Marine Sci, Oban, Argyll, ScotlandUniv Liverpool, Earth Ocean & Ecol Sci, Liverpool, Merseyside, EnglandDept Environm Food & Rural Affairs, London, EnglandNatl Oceanog Ctr, Southampton, Hants, EnglandUniv Exeter, Ctr Geog & Bwironmental Sci, Exeter, Cornwall, EnglandZayed Univ, Coll Nat & Hlth Sci, Abu Dhabi, U Arab EmiratesMet Off, Exeter, Devon, EnglandRoyal Netherlands Inst Sea Res NIOZ, Texel, NetherlandsUniv Utrecht, Texel, NetherlandsNatl Oceanog Ctr, Liverpool, Merseyside, EnglandNERC, Swindon, Wilts, England",Bantry Marine Res StnDept Environm Food & Rural Affairs,,,2020-03-18,WOS:000521220600001,,

We broadly review the environmental effects of decommissioning, analyse case studies, and outline analytical approaches that can advance our understanding of ecological dynamics on oil and gas structures. We find that ecosystem functions and services increase with the age of the structure and vary with geographical setting, such that decommissioning decisions need to take an ecosystem approach that considers their broader habitat and biodiversity values. Alignment of decommissioning assessment priorities among regulators and how they are evaluated, will reduce the likelihood of variable and sub-optimal decommissioning decisions. Ultimately, the range of allowable decommissioning options must be expanded to optimise the environmental outcomes of decommissioning across the broad range of ecosystems in which platforms are located.

Both nations will face challenges in connecting renewable sources in remote areas over (electrically) long cable or overhead DC routes and also challenges in controlling a system with a high proportion of asynchronous generation. This proposal identifies areas of common technical challenge and lays out a joint programme to analyse the issues and assess possible solutions. Fully exploiting the potential transfer capacity is vital; in China this is from western/central hydro resources to eastern/costal cities and in the UK from Scottish and North Sea wind resource to southern load centres. The realisable transfer capacity from a set of AC and DC routes depends on exactly how the control of the system is arranged under differ loading conditions (which affects stability constraints) and on the risk profile of the configuration (which affects the de-loading for redundancy and security reasons). We will investigate coordinated control of AC, DC and FACTS elements to optimise transfer capacity and will develop tools to support operator decision-making including risk analysis. A national transmission system run with a high proportion of asynchronous generation has little inertia and so explicit frequency response needs to be synthesised to maintain the system frequency within limits. Two specific aspects will be investigated: the ability to provide frequency response services across a DC link (from kinetic energy from wind turbines at the remote end) without explicit communication of frequency data and the headroom required in power converters (turbine and HVDC) to accommodate this service. The protection schemes that identify and isolated faulty equipment are also impacted by use of asynchronous generation since their power converter interfaces offer much lower short-circuit currents that are difficult to discriminate. The problem will be analysed in detail and re-engineering of the protection schemes proposed. A series of technical challenges that arise from widespread use of HVDC to connect remote renewable resources will also be studied. First is the operation and protection of multi-terminal HVDC that would allow meshing of DC routes to form more secure networks providing that the power flow and fault management issues can be addressed. Second is the reassessment of wind farm collection networks to eliminate potentially wasteful energy conversion stages. Third is innovation in HVDC converter design to make cost-effective the supply (or in-feed) of small fractions of power at intermediate points.The main programme of work will be conducted by post-doctoral research associates in China and the UK each of whom will have a 3-month placement in the other country to deepen the interaction between the research teams. In China, PhD projects will also be arranged around the key research themes. In the UK, the work will be allied to the existing PhD cohorts in the universities. A steering committee that meets alternately in China and the UK will manage the programme.The key outputs will be the analysis methods that are developed to assess the problems identified (and which are useful to grid system operators); proposals for engineering solutions (useful to system operators and equipment vendors) and verification of these proposals through scaled laboratory test systems and real-time simulation.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,EP/K006312/1,,,,,,,,Imperial College London,,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:15307882,,

However, coral restoration programs typically lack rigor and critical evaluation of their effectiveness. A review of 83 peer-reviewed papers that used coral transplantation for reef restoration reveals that growth and survival of coral fragments were the most widely used indicators of restoration success, with 88% of studies using these two indicators either solely (55%) or in combination with a limited number of other ecological factors (33%). In 53% of studies, reef condition was monitored for 1 year or less, while only 5% of reefs were monitored for more than 5 years post-transplantation. These results highlight that coral reef restoration science has focused primarily on short-term experiments to evaluate the feasibility of techniques for ecological restoration and the initial establishment phase post-transplantation, rather than on longer-term outcomes for coral reef communities. Here, we outline 10 socioecological indicators that comprehensively evaluate the effectiveness of coral reef restoration across the four pillars of sustainability (i.e. environmental, sociocultural, governance, and economic contributions to sustainable communities). We recommend that evaluations of the effectiveness of coral restoration programs integrate ecological indicators with sociocultural, economic, and governance considerations.

Using a three-dimensional biophysical model, we quantified the potential connectivity of larvae, particularly relevant to reef fishes, from three offshore platforms to four coastal shelf regions where the majority of rocky settlement habitat occurs in the SCB. The regions cover the shelves of the mainland coast and islands and offshore banks in the southern SCB. The main findings indicate that (1) the potential for larval subsidies from platforms in the southern SCB to populations in the northern SCB are greater than the potential for larval subsidies from platforms in the northern SCB to the southern SCB; (2) there is greater seasonal variability of potential connectivity from platforms to the mainland shelf region of the northern SCB than to the mainland shelf region of the southern SCB or shelves around islands and banks; and (3) there is consistency across years in the relative magnitude of potential connectivity from the platforms to the four shelf regions.

An artificial reef complex was built in response to protection, mitigation and restoration needs in an area subjected to illegal trawling, destruction of seagrass beds and the discharge of muddy material. The reef complex consisted of large concrete blocks (2 X 2 X 2 m) arranged in pyramids and single small concrete blocks (1.2 X 1.2 X 1.2 m). Short-term observations were intended to show seasonal changes in the settlement periods for exploitable resources such as oysters (Ostrea edulis). The long-term investigations were intended to show the pattern of sessile biota development, climax stages and interaction with fishes. To accomplish these objectives, asbestos panels (20 X 30 X 0.4 cm) were immersed for 1, 3, 6, 9 and 12 months at four stations in different depths. Photographic and removal sampling have been used since 1986. Results indicated consistent increases in biomass, cover and number of sessile species with time of panel immersion. Decreases were observed in relation to depth, particularly from stations at -18 m to -30 m. Similar patterns of community development occurred over all 3 years. After 1 year the community was dominated by encrusting bryozoans, serpulids, hydroids, barnacles, ascidians, bivalves and algae (also Corallinaceae), although they occurred in different proportions according to depth. Mussels were never dominant, as has been described for other artificial reefs in the Adriatic (Ancona) and Middle Tyrrhenian Sea (Fregene).

Understanding this ecosystem service is important but difficult because of complex taxonomic diversity, history and geography of benthic biomass. Using South Georgia as a model location (where the history and geography of benthic biology is relatively well studied) we investigated whether the composition of functional groups were critical to benthic accumulation, immobilization and burial pathway to sequestration-and also aid their study through simplification of identification. We reclassified [1], [2]) morphotype and carbon mass data to 13 functional groups, for each sample of 32 sites around the South Georgia continental shelf. We investigated the influence on carbon accumulation, immobilization and sequestration estimate by multiple factors including the compositions of functional groups. Functional groups showed high diversity within and between sites, and within and between habitat types. Carbon storage was not linked to a functional group in particular but accumulation and immobilization increased with the number of functional groups present and the presence of hard substrata. Functional groups were also important to carbon burial rate, which increased with the presence of mixed (hard and soft substrata). Functional groups showed high surrogacy for taxonomic composition and were useful for examining contrasting habitat categorization. Functional groups not only aid marine carbon storage investigation by reducing time and the need for team size and speciality, but also important to benthic carbon pathways per se. There is a distinct geography to seabed carbon storage; seabed boulder-fields are hotspots of carbon accumulation and immobilization, whilst the interface between such boulder-fields and sediments are key places for burial and sequestration.

Second, we considered these thtee indices with respect to two ARs (AR1 and AR2) and determined wake volumes using the element-based finite volume method. AR2 was found to have better efficiency and tranquillity indices than AR1 because of its size and complexity. The AR1 stability index was slightly better than that of AR2. Overall, AR2 (box type with a steel box inside) showed better wake region performance, mainly because of a higher efficiency index (9.55) compared with that of AR1 (2.00).

This process must consider impacts to marine ecosystems to meet regulatory requirement and for best environmental practice. However, there is a paucity of information globally on the ecosystem value of these structures, despite the many thousands that are installed throughout our oceans. This study provides the first assessment of fish assemblages and habitats formed by colonising invertebrates on oil and gas wellheads and associated infrastructure in depths of 78-825 m on the north west shelf of Western Australia. Video footage was obtained from Remotely Operated Vehicles deployed by industry on 25 wellhead structures, with six surveyed in each of four distinct depth zones: 78-85 m, 125-135 m, 350-395 m and 490-550 m, and one in 825 m depth. A total of 7278 individual fish from 60 species and 35 families were observed. Commercially important lutjanid (snapper) and epinephelid (grouper) species were common and most abundant on well infrastructure to depths of 135 m, but were absent in depths > 350 m. An as yet unidentified species of roughy, recorded here as Gephyroberyx sp. was the most common fish species observed on well infrastructure in depths > 350 m. Two speckled swellsharks (Cephaloscyllizon speccum), believed to be endemic to north-west Australia, were observed for the first time in situ. Numerous fish species were observed at depths beyond their known limits and two IUCN vulnerable species were recorded: the grey nurse shark (Carcharias taurus; 135 m depth) and the round ribbontail ray (Taeniura meyeni; 78 m depth). Fish assemblages and colonising invertebrate habitats present on wellheads and associated infrastructure were strongly influenced by depth, age and height of the structures. Older, taller wellheads in depths < 135 m possessed greater abundances of groupers, snappers, site-attached reef species, and transient pelagic fish species. Beyond 350 m depth, the number of species and total fish abundance declined markedly, as did the percent cover of ascidians, black/octocorals, sponges and Gorgonocephalidae (basket stars) observed growing on the infrastructure. Deeper structures were characterised by an abundance of Gephyroberyx sp. and, while these structures had less colonising invertebrate coverage in general, crinoids (490-550 m) and crustacea (barnacles; 350-395 m) were dominant at these depths. With very little known about marine ecosystems in depths > 100 m, or about wellheads as a type of subsea structure, this study demonstrates the ecological value of ROV footage obtained during industry operations and is indicative of the importance of subsea oil and gas infrastructure as a habitat for fish, and potentially as structures with value to fisheries.",,,,,,,,,31,0,0,0,25,0,31,,,0278-4343,1873-6955,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Western Australia, UWA Oceans Inst, 35 Stirling Hwy, Crawley, WA 6009, AustraliaUniv Western Australia, Oceans Grad Sch, 35 Stirling Hwy, Crawley, WA 6009, AustraliaUniv Western Australia, Sch Biol Sci, 35 Stirling Hwy, Crawley, WA 6009, AustraliaWoodside Energy, GPO Box D188, Perth, WA 6840, Australia",,,,2018-12-28,WOS:000441486200002,,

Seaweed beds are declining with environmental change and pollution. In affected areas, including urchin barrens and those affected by whitening events, coralline algae appear, preventing the attachment of seaweed spores to the substrate. Many methods have been used to restore seaweed beds, such as those employing artificial reefs, seaweed ropes, spore bags, and transplanted cultures. However, such efforts are insufficient to overcome the disappearance of seaweed beds from coastal areas. This study examined the use of a new technique that involves encapsulating seaweed zygotes with polysaccharide-like alginates to improve their attachment using the brown algaSargassum fulvellum, which plays an important role in seaweed forests. We tested the efficacy of encapsulated zygotes using polyvinyl chloride (PVC) panels and concrete bricks in the sea. In the laboratory, the germination percentage of encapsulatedSargassumzygotes was 70% +/- 1.6%, similar to the rate of unencapsulated zygotes.

The focus is on projects harvesting energy from winds, waves and currents. Environmental concerns induced by MRE projects are reported based on a classification scheme identifying stressors, receptors, effects and impacts. Although the potential effects of stressors on most receptors are identified, there are large knowledge gaps regarding the corresponding (positive and negative) impacts. In that context, the development of offshore MRE requires the implementation of fit-for-purpose monitoring activities aimed at environmental protection and knowledge development. Taking European legislation as an example, it is suggested to adopt standardized monitoring protocols for the enhanced usage and utility of environmental indicators. Towards this objective, the use of the FoR approach is advocated since it provides guidance for the definition and use of coherent set of environmental state indicators. After a description of this framework, various examples of applications are provided considering a virtual MRE project located in European waters. Finally, some conclusions and recommendations are provided for the successful implementation of the FoR approach and for future studies. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

The ability to assess recreational harvest is important for determining the effectiveness of AR deployments. Harvest estimation at AR fisheries pose many logistical and budgetary challenges. We present a pragmatic approach to estimate harvest at an AR off coastal Sydney, Australia, that combines existing datasets and a cost-effective sampling design from two different time periods. Fishing effort data collected from June 2013 to May 2014 were derived directly from digital images of the AR and were validated by direct observation. Multiple datasets were then integrated to obtain a list of taxa that are harvested by recreational fishers within the AR area. Data from a series of probability-based surveys conducted prior to the deployment of the AR from March 2007 to February 2009 were used to obtain estimates of harvest rates for these taxa. Harvest at the reef was estimated by multiplying fishing effort and these harvest rates together. Total annual recreational harvest from the AR during June 2013 May 2014 was estimated to be 1016 82 fish by number, 700 59 kg of fish by weight, and 12,504 kg per km2. Standardized harvest at the Sydney AR was relatively high (2.3-43.6 times larger) compared to other fishery areas from which the fishable area is known. Harvest at the AR was dominated by 6 functional groups (ambush predators, leatherjackets, large to medium pelagic fish, small pelagic fish, medium demersal predators and large demersal predators), which accounted for 92% of the total annual harvest by number, and 95% of the total annual harvest by weight. Comparisons of standardized harvest between the Sydney AR and other fishery areas revealed two distinct groups, a) the AR and Swansea channel, a marine dominated entrance to a large estuary, and b) all other fishery areas. The use of existing datasets from a previous time period to represent current conditions in a fishery can be subject to potential bias since harvest composition and harvest rates were calculated using data collected prior to the implementation of the AR. However, this pragmatic approach may be the only viable option when the implementation of probability-based survey methods is logistically complex and prohibitively costly. Future studies attempting to estimate harvest at small, discrete AR fisheries located near large population centers should therefore consider an integrated methodology that combines existing datasets and cost-effective sampling designs.

The project's first step was to initiate comprehensive siting and design studies. A 25-yr time series of kelp surface canopy maps for a 100 km reach of coastline was entered into a GIS database and analyzed in conjunction with geotechnical and human-use information to define ecologically favorable and acceptable sites in the general area. A site was chosen near an area that appeared most promising in the primary study area. This study's field work determined that the design of the mitigation reef will not be straightforward and that an experimental phase to test various designs needs to be performed. We recommend that a low relief (0.5-1.5 m) reef with relatively high exposure to sand scour and occasional, partial burial be constructed in order to promote the establishment of kelp. Scattered rock and broken concrete at three different density spreads (17, 34, and 67%) on the bottom will be tested. This study has revealed that existing artificial reefs have not typically sustained a persistent kelp bed. This fact, therefore, makes the Phase I experiment even more critical than originally thought.",,,,,,,,,3,0,0,,3,0,3,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1998-06-01,BCI:BCI199900213021,,

The three species consumed similar prey items, mainly a variety of crustaceans, teleosts, polychaetes and macroalgae, but the proportions of the items differed among species. The dietary composition of all three scorpionfish differed significantly in nearshore waters, but not between H. otakii and S. schlegelii in offshore waters, where both species fed predominantly on carideans, penaeids and brachyurans. The delta C-13 values varied significantly among the three scorpionfish in nearshore waters, and tended towards significance (P=0.053) between H. otakii and S. schlegelii in offshore waters, suggesting that they partition food resources. Bayesian mixing models further confirmed that all scorpionfish were generalist carnivorous and that the main food sources were assimilated in different proportions. In the nearshore waters, resource partitioning occurs among the three scorpionfish, reducing the potential for competition and the feeding ecology implies that they have dietary plasticity, which facilitates their coexistence and maintains local benthic fish community stability.",,,,,,,,,13,2,0,0,8,0,15,,,0018-8158,1573-5117,,,,,,,,,,"Ocean Univ China, Key Lab Mariculture, Minist Educ, Qingdao 266003, Peoples R ChinaDalian Ocean Univ, Ctr Marine Ranching Engn Sci Res Liaoning, Dalian 116023, Peoples R ChinaMurdoch Univ, Sch Vet & Life Sci, South St, Murdoch, WA 6150, AustraliaQingdao Natl Lab Marine Sci & Technol, Lab Marine Fisheries Sci & Food Prod Proc, Qingdao 266072, Peoples R ChinaUniv Antilles, UMR BOREA, Lab Excellence CORAIL, CNRS 7208,MNHN,UPMC,UCBN,IRD 207,DYNECAR, F-97157 Pointe a Pitre, Guadeloupe, FranceMurdoch Univ, Harry Butler Inst, Ctr Sustainable Aquat Resources, South St, Murdoch, WA 6150, AustraliaMurdoch Univ, Asia Res Ctr, South St, Murdoch, WA 6150, Australia",,,,2018-12-28,WOS:000450842300022,,

This study investigates the effects of severe short-term (8 days) exposure to acidified seawater on infaunal mediation of ecosystem processes (bioirrigation and sediment particle redistribution) and functioning (nutrient concentrations). Following acidification, individuals of Amphiura filiformis exhibited emergent behaviour typical of a stress response, which resulted in altered bioturbation, but limited changes in nutrient cycling. Under acidified conditions, A. filiformis moved to shallower depths within the sediment and the variability in occupancy depth reduced considerably. This study indicated that rapid acidification events may not be lethal to benthic invertebrates, but may result in behavioural changes that could have longer-term implications for species survival, ecosystem structure and functioning.

Current management strategies tend to look to the past to set goals, focusing on halting declines and restoring baseline conditions. Here, we explore a complementary approach to decision making that is based on the anticipation of future changes in ecosystem state, function and services. Reviewing the existing literature and utilizing a scenario planning approach, we explore how the structure of coral reef communities might change in the future in response to global climate change and overfishing. We incorporate uncertainties in our predictions by considering heterogeneity in reef types in relation to structural complexity and primary productivity. We examine 14 ecosystem services provided by reefs, and rate their sensitivity to a range of future scenarios and management options. Our predictions suggest that the efficacy of management is highly dependent on biophysical characteristics and reef state. Reserves are currently widely used and are predicted to remain effective for reefs with high structural complexity. However, when complexity is lost, maximizing service provision requires a broader portfolio of management approaches, including the provision of artificial complexity, coral restoration, fish aggregation devices and herbivore management. Increased use of such management tools will require capacity building and technique refinement and we therefore conclude that diversification of our management toolbox should be considered urgently to prepare for the challenges of managing reefs into the 21st century.",,,,,,,,,92,3,0,0,73,1,103,,,1354-1013,1365-2486,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Queensland, Marine Spatial Ecol Lab, Sch Biol Sci, Brisbane, Qld 4072, AustraliaUniv Queensland, Australian Res Council Ctr Excellence Coral Reef, Sch Biol Sci, Brisbane, Qld 4072, AustraliaUniv Exeter, Marine Spatial Ecol Lab, Coll Life & Environm Sci, Exeter EX4 4QD, Devon, EnglandUniv Queensland, Global Change Inst, Brisbane, Qld 4072, Australia",,,,2015-02-01,WOS:000348652400002,25179273,

Key uncertainties were identified and the effect of future impacts on the carbon budget were assessed. The water of the shelf seas contains between 210 and 230 Tmol of carbon and absorbs between 1.3 and 3.3 Tmol from the atmosphere annually. Off-shelf transport and burial in the sediments account for 60-100 and 0-40% of carbon outputs from the NWES, respectively. Both of these fluxes remain poorly constrained by observations and resolving their magnitudes and relative importance is a key research priority. Pelagic and benthic carbon stocks are dominated by inorganic carbon. Shelf sediments contain the largest stock of carbon, with between 520 and 1600 Tmol stored in the top 0.1 m of the sea bed. Coastal habitats such as salt marshes and mud flats contain large amounts of carbon per unit area but their total carbon stocks are small compared to pelagic and benthic stocks due to their smaller spatial extent. The large pelagic stock of carbon will continue to increase due to the rising concentration of atmospheric CO2, with associated pH decrease. Pelagic carbon stocks and flows are also likely to be significantly affected by increasing acidity and temperature, and circulation changes but the net impact is uncertain. Benthic carbon stocks will be affected by increasing temperature and acidity, and decreasing oxygen concentrations, although the net impact of these interrelated changes on carbon stocks is uncertain and a major knowledge gap. The impact of bottom trawling on benthic carbon stocks is unique amongst the impacts we consider in that it is widespread and also directly manageable, although its net effect on the carbon budget is uncertain. Coastal habitats are vulnerable to sea level rise and are strongly impacted by management decisions. Local, national and regional actions have the potential to protect or enhance carbon storage, but ultimately global governance, via controls on emissions, has the greatest potential to influence the long-term fate of carbon stocks in the northwestern European continental shelf.

Coral connectivity and spawning behaviour were studied to determine the possible source of coral seedling released during the spawning season, twice a year. A geographic reef viability index was established consisting of seven parameters which are coral larval density, pelagic larval length, sea currents, temperature, chlorophyll-a, depth, and substrate availability. The ocean hydrodynamic model was designed to resemble the pattern of larval scattering. By using the simulations and rankings, there were 95 (21%) sites which could probably be used for in situ reefing, whereas 358 (79%) sites were likely ideal for ex situ reefing.

The implementation of the marine ranching program in Korea has been a turning point in shifting from exploitative to sustainable fishery management. Of course, prior to the marine ranching program, the Korean government first introduced the installation of artificial reefs and fry release to promote fish stocks. However, as these projects were implemented independently, the convergence effect of the projects was not visible. In addition, the government, which had no choice but to rely solely on strengthening fishing regulations in its efforts to prevent a rapid decline in marine resources, sought to make a breakthrough in the enhancement sustainable use of marine resources through the marine ranching program.Accordingly, in 1999, the Korean government selected five marine ranching pilot programs in consideration of the characteristics of the eastern, western, southern, and Jeju coastal area, and invested approximately 150 billion won in capital in the pilot programs. Each program has been in progress for about 8 to 11 years, and all five pilot programs were completed in 2013, starting with Tongyeong marine ranching in 2006. The marine ranching programs were successfully implemented, leading to increases in marine resources, which led to increases in income from both fishing and non-fishing (e.g., recreational use) activities. However, in spite of this successful implementation, the marine ranching program has experienced some setbacks, such as illegal fishing and monitoring limitations. In conclusion, this study shows that the pilot programs need to overcome lack of management of fishing limit suitable for the level of resources, formal activities of marine ranching management of organizations and members, illegal fishing for fishers outside the organization, insufficient reporting of fishing performance and lack of statistics data, and insufficient connection to tourism business.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,1738-1592,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2021-07-07,KJD:ART002620548,,

Methods A comprehensive compilation of the scientific literature was performed to examine the distribution, human impacts and conservation status of the South Atlantic MEs. Results Our review indicated that the South Atlantic Ocean (SAO) is one of the major MEs areas in the world's oceans. The South Atlantic MEs are composed of a mosaic of distinct seascapes, mainly rhodolith beds, mesophotic reefs (i.e., rocky and biogenic) and marine animal forests (e.g., sponge aggregations, octocoral and black coral forests) that occur along the East South American and West African coasts, seamounts and oceanic islands. Throughout the SAO, the distinct seascapes of MEs are usually formed on the middle and outer continental shelves, shelf-edge, seamounts, submarine canyons, incised valleys and paleochannels, reef structures and insular shelves. We highlighted sea temperature anomalies, ocean acidification, extreme floods and droughts, fisheries, invasive species, marine debris, mining, and oil and gas exploitation as major threats to these ecosystems. Main conclusions Given the threats to the South Atlantic MEs, growing human pressures may degrade these ecosystems in the next years and undermine their unique biodiversity as well as their potential to provide connectivity between regions and depths.

How mobile reef fish use patchy habitat, and the potential consequences oil demographic parameters, must be known for spatially explicit population dynamics modeling, for discriminating essential fish habitat (EFH), and for effectively planning conservation measures (e.g., marine protected areas, stock enhancement, and artificial reefs). Gag, Mycteroperca microlepis, is an ecologically and economically important warm-temperate grouper in the southeastern United States, with behavioral and life history traits conducive to large-scale field experiments. The Suwannee Regional Reef System (SRRS) was built of standard habitat units (SHUs) in 1991-1993 to manipulate and control habitat patchiness and intrinsic habitat quality, and thereby test predictions from habitat selection theory. Colonization of the SRRS by gag over the first six years showed significant interactions of SHU size, spacing, and reef age; with trajectories modeled using a quadratic function for closely spaced SHUs (25 in) and a linear model for widely spaced SH Us (225 in), with larger SHUs (16 standardized cubes) accumulating significantly more gag faster than smaller 4-cube SHUs (mean = 72.5 gag/16-cube SHU at 225-m spacing by year 6, compared to 24.2 gag/4-cube SHU for same spacing and reef age). Residency times (mean = 9.8 mo), indicative of choice and measured by ultrasonic telemetry (1995-1998), showed significant interaction of SHU size and spacing consistent with colonization trajectories. Average relative weight (W-r) and incremental growth were greater oil smaller than larger SHUs (mean W, = 104.2 vs. 97.7; incremental growth differed by 15%), contrary to patterns of abundance and residency. Experimental manipulation of shelter on a subset of SRRS sites (2000-2001) confirmed our hypothesis that shelter limits local densities of gag, which, in turn, regulates their growth and condition. Density-dependent habitat selection for shelter and individual growth dynamics were therefore interdependent ecological processes that help to explain how patchy reef habitat sustains gag production. Moreover, gag selected shelter at the expense of maximizing their growth.

Boulders comprising a footprint of 36,017 m(2) were deployed on sand substrate, adjacent to hardbottom, to replace an expected covering of 30,756 m(2) hardbottom. Nourishment of the beach was initiated May 2005 and completed in February 2006. Fishes on the artificial mitigation reefs and neighboring natural hardbottom were counted annually in August, 2004 through 2008, with 30-m belt transects and rover-diver surveys. Across all surveys a total of 18,313 fish of 185 species was counted. Mean species richness and abundance were typically greater on the transects at mitigation reefs than on nearshore hardbottom (NHB). MDS plots of Bray-Curtis similarity indices show a clear distinction between the mitigation reefs and NHB fish assemblages regardless if the data were, or were not, standardized to account for rugosity differences. SIMPER analysis indicated the two assemblages had, on average, 75% dissimilarity. Thus, while the mitigation boulders exhibited greater abundance and species richness than the NHB, the two assemblages differed dramatically in structure. The mitigation reefs provided a habitat suitable for fish colonization. However, this habitat differed dramatically in size and appearance from impacted NHB and created a unique environment unlike the NHB.

J,,,,,,,,,Boyd McKew,,Quantifying a marine ecosystem's response to a catastrophic oil spill,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Awarded Grant,Dec 01 2017,2017,"Over 1.3 million tonnes of oil enters the sea each year from sources including oil rigs and tanker spills. Europe is particularly vulnerable to oil spills, as over half of the 20 biggest oil-shipping disasters have occurred there, including three in the UK. Recently on the 10th September the Agia Zoni oil tanker sank in the Saronic Gulf (near Athens, Greece) releasing over 2500 tonnes of fuel oil and marine gas into the marine environment. Such oil spills have severe impacts on the local marine life, tourism and fishing industry, as oil contains many different toxic hydrocarbons that can cause mass mortalities of birds, mammals, fish and shellfish. Fortunately there are some types of bacteria that can degrade hydrocarbons to naturally clean up the marine environment. Usually these specialist bacteria grow to very large numbers after an oil spill. However, it takes many different species of bacteria working together to degrade the hundreds of different types of hydrocarbons that are present in oil, and we still know very little about how these microbial consortia develop over time during an oil spill and subsequent clean-up operations. Oil spills can also have an impact on important microbially driven processes, such as the cycling of nitrogen. In marine environments, microorganisms convert nitrogen to different chemical forms (e.g. from ammonia to nitrite and then nitrate in a process known as nitrification), which can then be removed from the ecosystem as dinitrogen gas by denitrification. Too much nitrogen in the form of ammonia or nitrate could cause severe pollution problems, resulting in increased growth of algae, potentially triggering harmful and toxic algal blooms. Microorganisms involved in the N-cycle therefore perform vital ecosystem services, but presently we have very little understanding of how the nitrogen cycle is affected by large oil spills. In this study we will investigate some of these important research areas. Firstly, we will monitor the effects of the oil spill and subsequent clean-up operation over a 10-month period. We will determine which microorganisms (Bacteria, Archaea, Fungi and microalgae) are affected by the oil in either a positive way (e.g. increase in abundance of oil-degrading microbes) or negative way (e.g. direct toxicity of oil or being out-competed by oil-degrading microbes). This will be achieved by extracting DNA from oil-contaminated sediments and water followed by sequencing and quantifying taxonomic marker genes. At the same timepoints, we will measure changes in hydrocarbon composition and concentration. This will allow us to determine changes in the specialist hydrocarbon-degrading microbial communities in relation to hydrocarbon availability, and improve our understanding of the indigenous microbial community to remove the oil.We will also perform a focused analysis on N-cycling microorganisms (both nitrifying and denitrifying organisms) to determine how their abundances are affected in response to the oil spill. This will determine whether they may be any overall negative effects on the important ecosystem service that they perform.Finally our research will quantify the effect of the oil spill on the wider marine food web by recording effects on marine animals, including invertebrates such as shellfish, as well as fish and marine mammals, to establish which species are affected by oil spills and how well their populations recover from the spill over time.Since opportunities to study large oil spills in situ are rare, it is important for us to understand the effects of an oil spill in natural settings to enable the design of better oil remediation and management strategies for future spills and limit the damage they cause to coastal environments and marine life.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,NE/R016569/1,,,,,,,,University of Essex,,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:15355743,,

Owing to the strong northerly winds in that area, considerable pressure exists to construct wind farms. A total of 145,432 soaring birds, including 134,599 storks and 9,376 raptors over a period of 453.6 hours were observed between 20 August and 29 October by two teams working daily in two shifts. White Stork Ciconia ciconia and European Honey Buzzard Pernis apivorus were the most numerous species (91.4% and 5.7% respectively) of all soaring birds observed. As both species migrate early, relatively few birds were recorded passing through in October. A total of 57,179 soaring birds were observed within a range of 2.5 km from the observers, and of these 32,248 were flying at heights up to 200 m. Few individuals of the rapidly declining breeding populations of Egyptian Vulture Neophron percnotperus ('Endangered') and Lesser Kestrel Falco naumanni ('Vulnerable') passed (8 and 33 respectively). Pallid Harriers Circus macrourus ('Near Threatened') however, were more numerous (100) than at other migration sites along the East African-West Asian Flyway (Israel, southern tip of Sinai, Suez and Bab-el-Mandeb). Western Marsh Harrier Circus aeruginosus and Montagu's Harrier Circus pygargus were also more numerous than at these sites. Some other large migrant species, observed at Suez, Bab el-Mandeb or in Israel, were seen only in small numbers or not at all at Zeit Bay in autumn. Among them, the Steppe Eagle Aquila nipalensis being the best known example of loop migration, entering Africa at Suez and Bab el-Mandeb, is for this reason not expected in autumn at Zeit Bay, while in spring it is a regular migrant. The number of Black Storks Ciconia nigra observed accounted for 4.8% of the flyway population, that of White Storks for 33.3%, Great White Pelicans Pelecanus onocrotalus for a further 3.5% and European Honey Buzzards for 0.8%. The extrapolation of the number of birds passing through the study area during the migration season, suggests that it was used by 92% of the White Stork, 12% of the Black Stork, 5% of the Great White Pelican, 4% of the European Honey Buzzard and 2% of the Pallid Harrier flyway populations in autumn 2006.",,,,,,,,,7,0,0,0,8,0,10,,,0959-2709,1474-0001,,,,,,,,,,"Johannes Gutenberg Univ Mainz, Inst Zool, D-55128 Mainz, GermanyUniv Osnabruck, Dept Biol Chem, Expt Ecol Grp, D-49076 Osnabruck, Germany",,,,2011-12-01,WOS:000297981600001,,

The chapter concludes with a summary of commonly used habitat mapping technologies. Benthic (seafloor) habitats are physically distinct areas of seabed that are associated with particular species, communities, or assemblages that consistently occur together. Benthic habitat maps are spatial representations of physically distinct areas of seabed that are associated with particular groups of plants and animals. Habitat maps can illustrate the nature, distribution, and extent of distinct physical environments present and importantly they can predict the distribution of the associated species and communities.The data sets collected for constructing habitat maps provide fundamental information that can be used for a range of management and industry applications, including the management of fisheries, spatial marine environmental management, design of marine reserves, supporting offshore oil and gas infrastructure development, port and shipping channel construction, maintenance dredging, tourism, and seabed aggregate mining. Seafloor habitat mapping provides fundamental baseline information for decision-makers working in these sectors.GeoHab (www.geohab.org) is an international association of marine scientists conducting research using a range of mapping technologies into the use of biophysical (i.e., geologic and oceanographic) indicators of benthic habitats and ecosystems as proxies for biological communities and species diversity. Using this approach, combinations of physical attributes of the seabed identify habitats that have been demonstrated to be effective as surrogates for the benthic communities that they typically support. Thus management priorities can be identified using seabed habitat maps as a guide. The work of GeoHab demonstrates how knowledge of seabed properties can be employed to guide marine environmental management, marine resource management, and conservation efforts.Seafloor geomorphology is one of the more useful of the physical attributes of the seabed mapped and measured by GeoHab scientists. Different geomorphic features (e.g., submarine canyons, seamounts, atolls, fjords, etc.) are commonly associated with particular suites of habitats. Knowledge of the geomorphology and biogeography of the seafloor has improved markedly over the past 15 years. Using multibeam sonar, submarine features such as fjords, sand banks, coral reefs, seamounts, canyons, and spreading ridges have been revealed in unprecedented detail. The case studies presented in this book represent a range of seabed geomorphic features where detailed bathymetric maps have been combined with seabed video and sampling to yield an integrated picture of the benthic communities that are associated with different types of benthic habitat.",,,,,,,,,3,1,0,0,2,0,4,,,,,978-0-12-814961-4; 978-0-12-814960-7,,,,,,,,,"UNEP GRID Arendal, Arendal, NorwayUniv Sydney, Sch Geosci, UNEP GRID Arendal, Sydney, NSW, Australia",UNEP GRID Arendal,,,2020-12-31,WOS:000540371300003,,

Today, over 3,837 offshore oil and gas platforms have been installed, producing 25% of the U.S.A.'s natural gas and approximately 13% of its oil. In addition to meeting the world's energy needs, these structures also form one of the world's most extensive de facto artificial reef systems. However, federal regulations require that these structures be removed within 1 yr after the mineral lease is terminated. Disposal of obsolete offshore oil and gas structures is not only a financial liability for private industry, but can also result in a loss of productive marine habitat. In 1986, the Louisiana Fishing Enhancement Act was signed into law in response to the National Fishing Enhancement Act, creating the Louisiana Artificial Reef Program. This program was designed to take advantage of fishing habitat opportunities offered by these obsolete platforms. Since the program's inception, 25 reef sites have been created off Louisiana's coast using the components (jackets and decks) of 71 obsolete platforms. The use of obsolete oil and gas platforms in Louisiana has proved to be highly successful. Their quantity, design, longevity, and stability have provided a number of advantages over the use of traditional artificial reef materials. Participating companies also save money by converting structures into reefs rather than abandoning them onshore. They then are required to donate a portion of the savings to the state to run the artificial reef program. One disadvantage, however, is that the large size of these platforms restricts the distance from shore where they can be placed. To achieve the minimum clearance of 16 m over a submerged structure, as required by the New Orleans (8th) Coast Guard District regulations, the platforms must be placed in waters deeper than 30 m. Waters of this depth are found between 22 km and 115 km from shore on Louisiana's gently sloping continental shelf, making them almost inaccessible to many anglers. Funds generated by the program, however, can be used to develop reefs to closer to shore if alternative low-profile materials are used. Due to the high maintenance costs of both the structure and aids to navigation, the increased liability exposure, and the undetermined cost of removing the structure once it becomes a hazard to public safety and navigation, leaving the structures standing in place has thus far proved not to be a viable option in Louisiana.",,,,,,,,,11,0,0,0,4,0,16,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1998-06-01,BCI:BCI199900213019,,

Less studied is how seascape context may affect other aspects of habitat quality including growth, condition, or production of focal species. Juvenile white grunts Haemulon plumierii are known to rest on patch reefs during the day and move into seagrass habitat at night to feed, linking multiple habitats through these daily foraging migrations. We created artificial reefs across a gradient of seagrass cover and determined how juvenile white grunt condition, growth, abundance, and secondary production were related to seagrass cover within the seascape. White grunt abundance was positively correlated with the cover of seagrass within the seascape, while condition (relative condition factor, K-n) and growth rate (measured using the ratio of RNA to DNA) did not vary among reefs within different seascapes. Secondary production of white grunts was found to be highest on reefs in seascapes with more seagrass. Our results are consistent with the hypothesis that increased food resources associated with higher seagrass cover contribute to increased grunt production. Differences in habitat quality among reefs in different seascapes were manifest at the population (abundance) and ecosystem function (secondary production) levels and not at the individual level (individual growth rate or condition factor). These results highlight the importance of considering multiple levels of individual and population responses in assessments of habitat quality, and add evidence that seascape composition should be considered in spatially explicit management strategies.",,,,,,,,,14,0,0,0,14,0,22,,,0171-8630,1616-1599,,,,,,,,,,"Florida Int Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Marine Sci Program, N Miami, FL 33181 USA",,,,2012-09-19,WOS:000307723300018,,

Hydrodynamic features greatly differ between floating and fixed artificial substrata, which in turn affect the structure of their associated communities. This study tested the hypothesis that floating and fixed artificial installations in a tropical reef system (Eilat, Red Sea) would support different benthic communities throughout space and time. Specifically, we examined differences in communities recruited onto settlement plates between floating and fixed installations deployed at three different sites, along a two-year monitoring period. The three sites exhibited distinct differences in species assemblages between the monitoring dates (6, 12, 18 and 24 months post deployment), mainly between the first and the last two dates. The average level of dissimilarity between floating and fixed installations increased over time at all sites. Over 50% of the dissimilarity between the floating and fixed installations resulted from five taxonomic groups i.e., bryozoans, bivalves, barnacles, sponges, including the amount of bare space on the settlement plates. The contribution of these groups to the dissimilarity changed both temporally within each site, and spatially among sites. The observed differences were related to the hydrodynamic characteristics of floating and fixed habitats, interacting with biotic features such as predation, successional processes and seasonality; and abiotic features including small-scale spatial changes, light, and position in the water column.

Dependent variables, recorded by divers (i.e., number of species, number of individuals, length (TL in cm), and species diversity (H')), were analyzed for their associations with potentially underlying environmental attributes using stepwise regression, TWINSPAN, and canonical correspondence analyses (CCA). The fish assemblages (dominated by haemulids, labrids, and serranids) were qualitatively and quantitatively similar to the assemblages described by others from the same general area. Pelagic fishes (carangids and scombrids) associated with the reefs were among the most numerous and were the largest predators in the assemblage. The stepwise regression analysis was able to account for fairly high percentages of the variation in number of species (37%), number of red snapper (43%), and size of red snapper (52%). TWINSPAN allowed the recognition of fish assemblages based on their inshore-offshore biotopes. Vermilion snapper was identified as a key indicator species. The CCA helped identify species groups and factors associated with them. The affinity of pinfish and spottail pinfish with rock jetty was evident, as was the association of triggerfish with vertical steel structure.

The species, with a tropical Atlantic origin (from Mauritania to Angola), however, is not found in the Strait of Gibraltar or the Alboran Sea and, probably, has been introduced by maritime traffic through the transport of adults / juveniles or by drifting egg capsules (not by ballast water since it lacks pelagic larval phase).

Ship navigation and the docking on offshore constructions is impeded by significant wave heights H-S > 1.3 m. For these reasons, improvements are required in recognition and forecasting of sea state H-S in the range 0-3 m. Thus, this necessitates the development of new methods to determine the distribution of meteo-marine parameters from remote sensing data with an accuracy of decimetres for H-S The operationalization of these methods then allows the robust automatic processing in near real time (NRT) to support forecast agencies by providing validations for model results.A new empirical algorithm XWAVE_C (C = coastal) for estimation of significant wave height from X-band satellite-borne Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data has been developed, adopted for coastal applications using TerraSAR-X (TS-X) and Tandem-X (TD-X) satellites in the German Bight and implemented into the Sea Sate Processor (SSP) for fully automatic processing for NRT services.The algorithm is based on the spectral analysis of subscenes and the model function uses integrated image spectra parameters as well as local wind information from the analyzed subscene. The algorithm is able to recognize and remove the influence of non-sea state produced signals in the Wadden Sea areas such as dry sandbars as well as nonlinear SAR image distortions produced by e.g. short wind waves and breaking waves. Also parameters of very short waves, which are not visible in SAR images and produce only unsystematic clutter, can be accurately estimated. The SSP includes XWAVE_C, a pre-filtering procedure for removing artefacts such as ships, seamarks, buoys, offshore constructions and slicks, and an additional procedure performing a check of results based on the statistics of the whole scene.The SSP allows an automatic processing of TS-X images with an error RMSE = 25 cm and Scatter Index SI = 20% for total significant wave height H-S from sequences of TS-X StripMap images with a coverage of similar to 30 km x 300 km across the German Bight. The SSP was tuned spatially with model data of the German Weather Service's (DWD) CWAM (Coastal WAve Model) with 900 m horizontal resolution and tuned in situ with 6 buoys located in DWD model domain in the German Bight. The collected, processed and analyzed data base for the German Bight consists of more than 60 TS-X StripMap scenes/overflights with more than 200 images since 2013 with sea state acquired in the domain H-S = 0-7 m with a mean value of 1.25 m over all available scenes at buoy locations.The paper addresses the development and implementation of XWAVE_C, and presents the possibilities of SSP delivering sea state fields by reproducing local H-S variations connected with local wind gusts, variable bathymetry and moving wind fronts under different weather conditions.

J,,,,,,,,,Keith Worden,,"Structural Health Monitoring of Systems of Systems: Populations, Networks and Communities",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Awarded Grant,Jun 30 2018,2018,"One of the main contributors towards the cost of high-value engineering assets is the cost of maintenance. Taking an aircraft out of service for inspection means loss of revenue. However, if damage occurs and leads to catastrophic failure, safety and casualties are major issues. In terms of an offshore wind farm, the cost of an unscheduled visit to a remote ocean site to replace a 75m blade is exceedingly high. If one adopts an approach to maintenance where the structure of interest is monitored constantly by permanent sensors, and data processing algorithms alert the owner or user when damage is developing, one can optimise the maintenance programme for cost without sacrificing safety. If damage is detected early, repair rather than replacement can be viable.The complexity of modern structures and their challenging operating environments make it difficult to develop algorithms that can detect and identify early damage. The relevant discipline - structural health monitoring (SHM) - suffers from problems that have prevented uptake of the technology by industry. Although structural complexity makes analysis difficult, one variant of SHM - the data-based approach - shows great promise. In this case one uses machine learning techniques to diagnose damage from measured data. Data-based SHM faces a number of challenges; the first is that most data-based approaches to SHM require measured data from the structure in all possible states of damage. For a structure like an 5 MW wind turbine - it is simply not conceivable that one should damage a single one for data collection purposes, let alone many. Fortunately, if one is only interested in whether damage is present or not, this is possible using only data from the healthy condition. One builds a picture of the healthy state of the structure and then monitors for deviations. This raises a second issue with data-based SHM; if one is monitoring the structure for changes, one does not wish to be deceived by a benign change in its environmental/operational conditions - so-called 'confounding influences'.The original Fellowship aimed to solve these problems via a population-based approach to SHM modelled on the discipline of 'syndromic surveillance' (SS), which is used to detect disease outbreaks in human populations. The core of the proposed research was an intelligent database holding data across populations of structures, and an inference engine that could use damage data from an individual, to allow diagnostics on others. The original work has progressed very well; the required database was created and algorithms for inference across populations have been developed and demonstrated. Algorithms for removing confounding influences have also been created which are arguably now the state of the art. The Fellowship so far has also allowed insights into how population-based SHM can go far beyond technologies based on SS, leading to this new proposal. Very new concepts in SHM will be explored. The first idea is to extend the 'database' to an 'ontology'; ontologies encode, share and re-use domain knowledge. In a way, moving to an ontology adds a 'language centre' to the existing storage and processing; one might even think of the result as a computational brain concentrating on a specific engineering field - in this case SHM. New population-based methods are proposed. For populations of near-identical structures, the idea of the 'form' of a structure is presented. The form is created to represent all individuals in a population, if damage data are available for an individual turbine in a wind farm, they can be transferred into the form and thus allow inference across the farm. Furthermore, a general theory of populations of disparate structures will be constructed using ideas from mathematics and computation: geometry, graph theory, complex networks and machine learning. Again, the theory will allow damage data from individuals to generate insights across the population.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,EP/R003645/1,,,,,,,,University of Sheffield,,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:15322481,,

As methods become more sophisticated and the theoretical framework more advanced, engineering of more complex and biologically diverse habitat types becomes possible. This review discusses the benefits of incorporating boulder habitat, which provides a unique combination of intermediate stability and high structural complexity, and can be occupied by many rare species. The inclusion of this habitat into engineered coastlines would therefore represent an important outcome for coastal ecological engineering by providing habitat for these species. Some methods are already in use to restore degraded boulder habitat; these methods should strive to closely mimic boulder habitat because semi-natural habitats (e.g. building rubble at bases of seawalls) have not been found to support rare species at this stage. Creation of new boulder habitat is also valuable for important fisheries (e.g. Haliotis spp.). Methods will be improved by focusing on small-scale microhabitats created by boulders and how these microhabitats provide shelter from locally relevant predators. Boulder habitat can reliably stabilise shorelines whereas alternative ecological engineering options based on littoral vegetation (e.g. mangroves, seagrass or saltmarsh) provide stabilisation involving strong spatiotemporal variability. Ecological engineering methods that include highly novel habitats, such as boulders, will achieve valuable biodiversity outcomes by allowing large-scale increases in along-shore distribution of specialist species. Overall, incorporation of boulder habitat in ecological engineering will help ensure coastal habitats include highly diverse assemblages and important ecological functionality as the pressure to modify coastlines increases.",,,,,,,,,25,1,0,0,22,0,27,,,0171-8630,1616-1599,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Tartu, Estonian Marine Inst, Maealuse 14, EE-12618 Tallinn, EstoniaUniv Sydney, Sch Life & Environm Sci A11, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia",,,,2018-05-11,WOS:000431203300012,,

Artificial reefs are typically designed to: 1) enhance specific biological communities, and 2) maintain their structural and functional integrity for many years without: deteriorating or being permanently covered by, sediment. In this context, having reliable and detailed ocean bottom characterization data is necessary to properly site and design artificial reefs. Southern California Edison is constructing the 150-acre San Clemente Artificial Reef in response to a California Coastal Commission/Marine Review Committee (CCC) Study, which determined that San Onofre Nuclear, Generating Station (SONGS) was impacting a nearby kelp bed community. The reef is being designed specifically to grow giant kelp (Macrocystis pyrifera). The 22.4-acre experimental phase of the mitigation project was built in September 1999. A five-year study is now underway to determine and refine the best construction techniques, the best material type (either concrete or quarry rock) and the most effective reef material spacing on the bottom. Detailed geophysical and geological surveys were carried out in the siting phase of this project at eleven different potential kelp artificial reef sites between 1991 and 1998. Once the San Clemente site was chosen, even more detailed bottom characterization studies were performed to assure the successful placement of the San Clemente Artificial Reef. These surveys utilized a precision fathometer, side-scan sonar, and a sub-bottom profiler, as well as ground-truthing surveys. This work was done not only to assure the successful placement of the reef, but also as critical input to the design of the reef itself.",,,,,MTS/IEEE Conference on Celebrating the Past - Teaming Toward the FutureMTS/IEEE Conference on Celebrating the Past - Teaming Toward the Future,"SEP 22-26, 2003SEP 22-26, 2003",Marine Technol Soc; IEEE; OES; Scripps Inst OceanogMarine Technol Soc; IEEE; OES; Scripps Inst Oceanog,"San Diego, CASan Diego, CA",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,0-933957-30-0,,,,,,,,,"Ecosyst Management Associate Inc, Carlsbad, CA 92009 USA",Ecosyst Management Associate Inc,,,2003-01-01,WOS:000221420300181,,

But in comparison to wind energy, wave power is still in its infancy, mainly prototype-based, with technological gaps akin to those experienced in the wind sector some 15 years ago. Several aspects that did not seem significant at a first glance in the design phase, such as the interaction with the marine environment, turned out to be important when the first prototypes were put in the water. In fact, these devices have to face great challenges once at sea and several prototypes have not survived. Firstly, ocean waves are not such an innocuous, predictable flow of water and secondly, life thrives in the ocean. Wave power devices are perfect artificial reefs suitable for algal growth and colonization by many species. And they will have to sustain harsh conditions for over two decades while producing energy. For obvious reasons, there is a lack of existing literature on the subject. In this short review we address a simple question: how tough will the life of wave power devices at sea be? The answer is based on available evidence. We provide as well some ideas to take up the challenge. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Details of the underlying drivers of climate change and its physical consequences are increasingly well understood. Changes in the physical properties of the marine system are especially important for biological components and include, inter alia, changes in ocean temperature and ocean acidification, reductions in the extent and timing of seasonal sea-ice and the retreat and collapse of ice shelves and glaciers. Nevertheless, the implications for biological systems remain poorly understood, above all, for how rapidly physical changes might cascade through marine foodwebs. It is therefore important that ecological studies that facilitate long-term comparisons are established, and in order to develop projections of the future consequences of climate change. These studies are best undertaken in the absence of any effects caused by other human activities. In this respect, ice-shelf collapse is of special importance as it opens up new habitats for biological colonisation and ecological succession, and impacts established biogeochemical cycles.A recent review by Trathan et al. highlighted how 50-years of retreat in ice shelves and coastal glaciers around the Antarctic Peninsula has exposed at least 2.4 x10^4 km^2 of new open water. These newly revealed habitats appear to have allowed new phytoplankton blooms that were rapidly followed by new marine zooplankton and seabed communities. In general, the fauna under existing ice shelves exists in oligotrophic, deep-sea-like conditions and, because ice shelf collapse may lead to greater nutrient input, there may be a shift in community structure through the loss and gain of species. Ice-shelf loss will allow increased levels of marine snow and benthic-pelagic coupling that will alter benthic nutrient cycling and may result in additional carbon storage. Further, terrigenous material may also be deposited in some of these habitats, potentially impacting upon the existing benthos and modifying conditions for future colonisation.The benthic communities of the Antarctic shelf show high levels of gigantism, longevity, slow growth, late maturity and endemism, meaning that many species are susceptible to disturbance. However, these communities are also potentially more dynamic than so far assumed and can show surprising rates of change, even over relatively short time periods. Nevertheless, they remain susceptible to environmental variability and change. Therefore, the regional nature of ongoing climate change coupled with the high levels of endemism mean that community processes will vary across a range of sites. Gaining early sight of communities will be key, prior to the commencement of species loss, or future colonisation.The Antarctic shelf ecosystems that form following ice-shelf loss will be susceptible to colonisation by species from immediately adjacent areas; however, other complex processes may also take place as ocean currents may create opportunities for species to return that were last present in the last interglacial, a warmer period than at present.Our project will use a four-fold approach:1) Characterisation of the benthic community formerly under A68, their assemblages and spatial distribution at a range of nested scales in relation to the distance from the former ice-shelf front. 2) Samples returned to the UK (preserved in ethanol, RNAlater, or stored at -80C) for future molecular genetic and genomic analysis of phylogeography, evolutionary history and metagenomics.3) Collection of macro- and megafauna and dietary sources such as ice-algae, plankton and organic matter in the sediment for food web analysis using bulk stable isotopes of delta 13C, 15N and 34S, and lipid analysis.4) In-vitro incubation whilst at sea to explore 13C uptake by infaunal meio- and macrofauna in multicorer-tube microcosms.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,NE/R012296/1,,,,,,,,NERC British Antarctic Survey,,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:15407180,,
J,,,,,,,,,Robert Grabowski,,Improved prediction of cohesive sediment erosion based on inter-particle forces,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Awarded Grant,Mar 31 2020,2020,"Cohesive sediment (more commonly known as mud) forms the bed of many waterways and coastal environments and is thus the foundation on which critically important engineering structures are built. These structures alter local water flows that can induce the erosion (or scour) of sediment, resulting in the undermining of bridge piers, abutments and revetments; compromising the foundations of off-shore wind turbines; and causing the self-burial of submarine pipelines. Scientists have long known that the composition of the sediment will affect its resistance to erosion, but have not been able to develop universal models to predict erosion thresholds, rates or depths of scour. Research in this topic has been hindered by (i) inconsistencies in how erosion is defined and measured and (ii) the large number of sediment properties that control cohesion and adhesion in cohesive sediment. Better predictions of erosion thresholds and rates are urgently required to improve the assessment of scour risk to protect essential transportation and energy infrastructure, particularly as climate change is predicted to increase the frequency and severity of storms that drive the hydrodynamic forces responsible for sediment erosion.This innovative study will advance the development of a physically-based predictive model of cohesive sediment erosion by focusing on the particle-particle and particle-fluid interactions that underlie cohesive and adhesive forces within cohesive sediment. It will combine (i) new field and laboratory research on erosion thresholds and rates of cohesive sediment and (ii) a novel computational dynamics model to simulate cohesive sediment mechanics and erosion dynamics. The research is composed of three work packages (WPs). In WP 1, erosion threshold and rates of natural and artificial sediments covering a diversity of sediment and water properties will be measured in the new EPSRC-funded UKCRIC facilities at Cranfield University. It will be the first time that the effects of sediment and water properties on cohesive sediment erosion will be investigated systematically in a single study using facilities capable of high-precision monitoring of water flow, the sediment bed surface, and the erosion of surface particles and aggregates. In WP 2, a Discrete Element Model (DEM) that represents cohesive sediment as a mixture of rigid, non-cohesive elements and smaller 'soft' cohesive elements will be combined with a Computational Fluid Dynamics model (CFD). This new coupled model incorporates several recent advances in the modelling of materials (a mixture of particle sizes with varying physical, chemical and mechanical properties) and permits the simulation of erosion at similar spatial and temporal scales as the laboratory analyses in WP 1. Finally, WP 3 will analyse, evaluate and compare the results of the empirical study (WP 1) and coupled numerical model (WP 2), employing statistical and probabilistic approaches to infer significant relationships between erodibility and sediment properties and evaluate the performance of the modelling. The study will produce a step-change in the scientific understanding of cohesive sediment mechanics and the prediction of erosion thresholds, rates and depth of scour. The greatly improved predictions of cohesive sediment erosion will have wide ranging applications that will help to protect critically important aquatic environments and water resources from contaminated sediment and engineering infrastructure from scour-induced failure.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,EP/T001100/1,,,,,,,,Cranfield University,,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:15304913,,

To address benthic carbon storage in the North-West European continental shelf, we have spatially predicted the mass of particulate organic carbon (POC) stored in the top 10 cm of shelf sediments in parts of the North Sea, English Channel and Celtic Sea using a Random Forest model, POC measurements on surface sediments from those seas and relevant predictor variables. The presented model explains 78% of the variance in the data and we estimate that approximately 250 Mt of POC are stored in surficial sediments of the study area (633,000 km(2)). Upscaling to the North-West European continental shelf area (1,111,812 km(2)) yielded a range of 230-882 Mt of POC with the most likely estimate being on the order of 476 Mt. We demonstrate that the largest POC stocks are associated with coarse-grained sediments due to their wide-spread occurrence and high dry bulk densities. Our results also highlight the importance of coastal sediments for carbon storage and sequestration. Important predictors for POC include mud content in surficial sediments, annual average bottom temperature and distance to shoreline, with the latter possibly a proxy for terrestrial inputs. Now that key variables in determining the spatial distribution of POC have been identified, it is possible to predict future changes to the POC stock, with the presented maps providing an accurate baseline against which to assess predicted changes.",,,,,,,,,47,1,0,0,22,0,49,,,0168-2563,1573-515X,,,,,,,,,,"Ctr Environm Fisheries & Aquaculture Sci, Lowestoft NR33 0HT, Suffolk, EnglandUniv Colorado, Inst Arctic & Alpine Res, Boulder, CO 80309 USA",,,,2017-09-22,WOS:000410456400010,32009697,

The fishery in the State of Paraiba is essentially artisanal, its fleet is composed by 1,842 units, with prevalence of row boats. The boats basically work in the come and go system, but some of them may stay up to 10 days at sea. The crew is composed of one to five men, working in different functions. Five different boat types were observed in the fishing communities visited: catraias, row boats, rafts, aluminum boats and motorized boats. Different fishing methods can be applied in a same fishing trip, and several types of fishing nets, fish traps and hooks are carried out on board. Catch composition analysis from sampled landings of 32 fishing boats, during February-April and August-November of 2006, revealed 46 specific fish taxa, of 26 families. A production of 3,426.7 kg was obtained, with an average yield of 137.07 kg/day and 107.08 kg/boat. The fish families with the largest biomass were Sconnbridae (29.6%) and Carangidae (29.4%). The most representative species in biomass are the jack (Carangoides. bartholomaei), with 25.0%, and Atlantic little tuna, Euthinnus. alletteratus, with 13.5%. Declining catch rates in the artisanal fishery were mentioned by almost all interviewees, and the fishery statistics show the same trend. Endangered or overexploited species were observed in the catches, with a complete lack of management strategies.

However, there is still a lack of knowledge regarding the pros and cons of introducing nearshore FADs in shallow coastal waters. This is particularly the case in areas such as the Persian Gulf where traditional handline fisheries supply daily food for local coastal communities. In this context, experimental anchored nearshore FADs were deployed in the north of the Persian Gulf in order to offer a preliminary assessment regarding their possible impact in terms of both catch efficiency and ecological perspectives. CPUE, biodiversity and catch composition were compared at fishery sites with or without FADs between two fishing seasons in the Persian Gulf. Total catches were relatively well balanced between sites using nearshore FADs or without FADs, and between fishing seasons. In contrast, our analysis suggests that the fish species diversity was lower for FAD fishing operations, than for non-FAD fishing. The main differences in the fish assemblages caught between FAD and non-FAD fishing sites were mainly due to pelagic species (e.g. Scomberoides commersonnianus, Caranx sexfasciatus and Acanthopagrus laws), some of which are considered as endangered species (Scomberomorus commerson). Pelagic species were more abundant in non-FAD fishing operations, suggesting that anchored FADs used in these nearshore waters had an effect similar to that of artificial reefs, favouring the transfer of fishing effort from the pelagic to the benthic resources.",,,,,,,,,5,0,0,0,3,1,5,,,0165-7836,1872-6763,,,,,,,,,,"Gorgan Univ Agr Sci & Nat Resources, Fisheries Dept, Gorgan, Golestan, IranAntenne IRD Polynesie Francaise, UMR EIO 241, F-98716 Tahiti, French Polynesi, France",,,,2019-04-01,WOS:000458939000005,,

Mytilus trossulus and its sister species, M. edulis, co-occur throughout the Canadian maritime provinces and the northern Gulf of Maine. While the abundance of M. trossulus decreases abruptly south of the Canadian border, M. edulis ranges south to North Carolina. Work to date has demonstrated that: 1) Adult M. trossulus in northeastern Maine inhabit coastal sites, islands, and man-made structures that are within the colder water of the Eastern Maine Coastal Current (EMCC). 2) Drifters released in the EMCC rarely enter nearshore waters to the south, suggesting that across-shelf transport is extremely limited. 3) Larvae of the two species may differ slightly in thermal tolerance, and some evidence suggests that tolerance may also be affected by nutritional status. 4) Mytilus trossulus juveniles transplanted within the northeastern Maine region, but outside of the EMCC, have high survivorship, while transplants further to the southwest suffer high mortality. In combination, these results suggest that larval transport sets the proximate range boundary within northeastern Maine (on a scale of 10 km), but thermal tolerance would ultimately limit the distribution on a larger spatial scale (200 km). This research project is designed to test this pair of hypotheses via a combination of field and lab experiments. Satellite drifters equipped with temperature loggers deployed in and out of the EMCC during the season of M. trossulus larval dispersal (mid-June to mid-August) will be used to quantify the physical flow fields and temperature regimes during larval dispersal. Drogues will allow us to assess whether larvae at different depths may experience different flow fields. Data from hydrographic surveys, combined with regular spatial and temporal sampling of mussel larvae and new settlers, will be used to assess possible associations between larval and post-settlement stages and different water masses. The physiological tolerance of new settlers will be assayed via transplants to sites in and out of the EMCC. Finally, laboratory growth and survival experiments will assay larval performance in different thermal and feeding regimes. The investigators will use molecular markers to identify the morphologically indistinguishable larvae and settlers of these sibling species. Broader Impacts This project will provide training for one MS and one PhD student, and several undergraduates. The PIs are at institutions that emphasize undergraduate and graduate research, and our project will provide numerous student opportunities for field and laboratory research in oceanography and benthic ecology. Such research opportunities are likely to attract a number of students who would otherwise pursue careers in biomedical research. The Gulf of Maine is home to a thriving Mytilis edulis aquaculture industry, and M. trossulus is a commercially inferior species - growers are concerned about its possible spread. Hence a better understanding of the factors determining the range boundary of this species will help growers avoid M. trossulus spat. Results will be disseminated to enhance communication with the Maine aquaculture community. All of the fieldwork will be conducted in a region of Maine facing great educational challenges; teachers from area schools will be recruited to assist with summer field and laboratory work.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,961157,,,,,,,,University of New England,,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:13620809,,

Prior to this study, 9362 breeding pairs were known to occur in two colonies. Currently, the colonies of Arica (34,684 nests), Pampa La Perdiz (624 nests) and Salar Grande (20,000 nests) represent almost 95% of the known breeding population. We found that the colony of Arica has a different breeding phenology to that of the Pampa Perdiz and Salar Grande colonies, which could be due to differences in their food phenology. None of the colonies lie within designated protected areas and they strongly overlap with current and planned mining, wind farms and power plants in northern Chile. Apart from the disturbance caused by destruction of habitat and nests, these developments are also important sources of artificial light that cause the grounding of fledglings, after which many of them probably die from the collision impact or predation. It is vital to ensure the conservation of this species by protecting their breeding grounds and by reducing the light pollution not only in the colonies, but also at the access points to the colonies and at the big cities nearby.",,,,,,,,,8,0,0,0,10,0,10,,,0373-2266,2213-1175,,,,,,,,,,"Red Observadores Aves & Vida Silvestre Chile, Julio Prado 1144,Dept 31, Santiago, Chile",Red Observadores Aves & Vida Silvestre Chile,,,2019-05-27,WOS:000467261900007,,

The present study describes the composition, spatial distribution and persistence of invertebrate megazoobenthic assemblages in the Adriatic Sea. Samples were collected during rapido trawl surveys performed from 2007 to 2012. A total of 4 main megazoobenthic assemblages were identified and were designated as A, B, C and D. Group A assemblages were detected in the northern and central offshore area, Group B assemblages occupied the northernmost part of the basin, Group C assemblages were predominantly found along the western coast and Group D assemblages were detected in the deepest parts of the northern and central basin. A degree of spatial overlap in the northern Adriatic was probably due to the physical and chemical characteristics of the area, which is characterized by strong river runoff, hence by changes in sediment composition from sandy mud to muddy sand.

However, caution is still required when assessing the economic benefits of artificial reefs. They may not be sufficient unto themselves, out of a broader framework of spatial regulation of professional and recreational fisheries and attendance. Each operation of immersion poses specifics problems (technical and practical) and requires obtaining prior administrative authorization, usually very stringent.The marine environment is protected by the basic principles of public domain; any form of private occupation or use remains systematically temporary, precarious and revocable.This first aspect is essential in the case of artificial reefs, in which immersion and productive potential are registered over the long term, without any real vocation to be removed from the seabed once their term expired. The administration is still very reserved about the perennity of artificial reefs, a concept against the classic rules in practice for the management of the public domain.The second aspect lies in the arrangements concerning the exploitation of artificial reefs. Purely private access and use of artificial reefs seem irrelevant, given the potential conflicts they generate and the physical and legal impossibility of recognizing a form of private property of the species they house. The public or collective uses are certainly more appropriate to the situation of artificial reefs, they are de facto majority, but do not offer legible and uniform mechanisms for implementation.Ultimately, artificial reefs offer a fragmented vision between different legal systems indirectly relevant to their case.

Data collected on fish assemblages were used to compare the fish trophic structure between shipwreck and natural reefs using diversity indices, permutational multivariate analysis of variance and similarity percentage analysis.Results : Fish abundance was two times greater on shipwreck than on natural reefs and the major trophic guilds on shipwreck were omnivores and carnivores. Multivariate analyses showed a distinct fish trophic structure on shipwreck from that of natural reefs and certain fish species differentiated the trophic structure of shipwreck from natural reefs. The high densities of Pomadasys furcatus, P. guoraca. Pempheris multiradiata. Lutjanus indicus, L. fulvus. Ostorhinchus compressus, Epinephelus coioides.

These platforms serve as artificial reefs on the continental shelf, where, until their introduction, shallow hard substrata were rare. This newly available substrate has helped to expand scleractinian coral populations in the GOM. Here, we conduct molecular genetic analyses on adult scleractinian corals on the Flower Garden Banks (FGB) coral reefs (similar to 180 knn SE of Galveston, TX) and on surrounding oil and gas platforms. We have attempted to determine the degree of genetic affinity among the natural populations and those on the surrounding platforms. The three most abundant hermatypic scleractinian species were sampled: Madracis decactis, Diploria strigosa, and Montastraea cavernosa. Tissue samples were collected from the East (E-) and West (W-) FGB, and seven platforms within a 65 km radius of the FGB, at a depth range of 5-37 m. Genetic variation was assessed using Amplified Fragment Length Polymorphisms (AFLPs). The large number of polymorphic markers generated by AFLPs allowed for the use of standard genetic analysis tools (AMOVA) as well as population allocation techniques (AFLPOP). AMOVA analyses indicated that the E- and W-FGB were genetically homogeneous for populations of Madracis decactis and Diploria strigosa; Montastraea cavernosa populations, however, were significantly different there. In all species, genetic distance (FST) increased significantly with geographic distance between populations. In the brooding species Madracis decactis, this pattern was even stronger when one considered distance between the platforms and the perimeters of the FGB, particularly the nearest FGB, suggesting that the FGB may be a source of larvae for platform populations. AFLPOP analyses showed that the degree of self-allocation to home sites also increased with inter-site distance. Cross allocations between sites dropped significantly and exponentially in all species within only one to several kms of the FGB. Madracis decactis, a brooder with extended larval release periods and near-immediate settlement competence, showed greater affinity to the FGB with distance than Diploria strigosa, a broadcaster. This brooder appears to be more effective at colonizing small, nearby target sites and expanding its geographic range at the meso-scale. The low degree of genetic affinity exhibited by all species on the platforms may be attributed to genetic drift/founder effect or relatively small samples sizes, although total populations were sampled. In general, genetic affinity decreased with inter-site distance. Young coral populations are highly differentiated at the meso-scale during early stages of community succession, implying that much time and repeated colonization of patchy habitats around larger potential larval sources will be required before genetic equilibrium or homogeneity is reached.

Planktonic ciliate communities showed a distinct seasonal pattern in ciliate abundance and a clear seasonal shift in the taxonomic composition.

In terms of spatial distribution, ciliate species were abundant in the area of artificial reefs, and ciliate abundance was higher in the Dapeng Cove aquaculture area and lower at the Daya Bay Nuclear Power Station. Clustering analysis demonstrated that the seasonal variations of the ciliate community structure were more obvious than spatial variations.

We also characterized abundances and distributions of select platform-dwelling benthic organisms (barnacles, blennies, and stone crabs). Sheepshead foraging was more strongly associated with dissolved oxygen (DO, mg/L; measured at each camera) and time to slack tide (high or low) than other biological (prey densities), physiochemical, locational, or temporal variables. The number of Sheepshead foraging incidents increased by 18.9incidents m( -2) h( -1) (95% confidence interval [CI]=4.6-33.3) when DO increased by 1.0mg/L; foraging incidents increased by 4.5incidents m( -2) h( -1) (95% CI=1.6-7.4) when time to slack tide increased by 1.0h.

Abundances of barnacles and blennies decreased with increasing depth.

Granite quarrying produces a range of low-value by-products, including an aqueous granite powder suspension. When mixed with other by-products and consolidated using 5% (w/w) cement and 5% (w/w) coal fly-ash, this substance was used to produce concrete blocks with a compressive strength of approximately 14 N mm(-2) after a standard 90-day curing period. The blocks exceeded the strength requirement of commercial building blocks (British Standard 6073) by five times, were cheaper to produce compared with standard construction-grade blocks, and permitted a range of design options to be considered through the inclusion of voids. The chemical stability of the proposed concrete and base granite material was tested, under conditions designed to maximize metal flux, and showed significant but very low leaching of iron, strontium, barium, rubidium, manganese, and uranium. Metal leaching was not necessarily in proportion to the metal concentration in the base material.

Twelve concrete reefs (cylinders) of 3 different sizes (52, 76 and 115 cm) were placed on randomly selected sites along a rocky intertidal platform. The area around each reef and 4 control sites were divided into 24 sampling cells (6 orientation and 4 distance categories). Hydrodynamic patterns around reefs and control sites were determined using the dissolution of plaster cylinders. Flow velocity was simulated around reefs using a finite-element hydrodynamic model. Substratum temperature was also measured. The biomass and density of benthic community adjacent to the reefs was sampled using 10 x 10 cm quadrats before and 1 yr after installation. Growth of individual Mytilus edulis attached to experimental panels was measured, A flow index revealed a strong scale-dependent gradient of decreasing water motion intensity with distance from the reefs, and the hydrodynamic model showed a reduction of flow velocity on the downstream side of large reefs. Substratum temperature was lower closer to reefs, and shaded areas increased with reef size. Maximum MI. edulis biomass was around large reefs, while the biomasses of other dominant species were not positively influenced by reef size. Biomass and density patterns close to the reefs were significant only around large reefs, with the downstream side having the lowest M. edulis biomass. Growth of M. edulis decreased significantly with distance away from the reefs. Biomass patterns were best explained by the flow velocity around the large reefs (R-2 = 0.27), while mussel growth was best correlated with substratum temperature close to the medium reefs (R-2 = 0.66). Our study shows that the spatial structure of the benthic community studied and its scaling with topographic heterogeneity depends on dominant mediating physical factors (i.e. hydrodynamic processes or substratum temperature).",,,,,,,,,48,0,0,0,39,3,55,,,0171-8630,1616-1599,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Laval, Dept Biol, GIRQQ, Quebec City, PQ G1K 7P4, CanadaUniv Laval, GIREF, Dept Genie Civil, Quebec City, PQ G1K 7P4, Canada",,,,2001-01-01,WOS:000170790300003,,

This capability was ground-truthed by placing a research vessel on the reef at known times and cross referencing this in photographs taken during these periods. Camera performance did diminish at times during the first few hours after sunlight, particularly during the warmer months, this was most likely caused by atmospheric turbulence occurring across the 9 km range.

This study took advantage of an existing network of subtidal oyster reefs and a large-scale oyster reef restoration effort in Pamlico Sound, North Carolina, to (1) compare estuarine fish assemblages on oyster reefs with those on unstructured bottom, (2) identify the short-term change in fish abundance and richness in response to reef creation, and (3) identify spatiotemporal trends in fish abundance and richness. We quantified transient and reef fish using gill nets and fish traps, respectively. Oyster reefs harbored more unique species than unstructured bottom, thereby enhancing the overall diversity of estuarine fish assemblages. Fish abundance on recently created experimental reefs (6-8 months postconstruction) was similar to that on control reefs that were 4-6years old, suggesting rapid colonization of new reefs. Fish diversity at 1 of 2 sites actually decreased on control reefs after reef construction, suggesting that rapid colonization of new reefs was due, in part, to the movement of fish from old to new reefs. Information on the distribution, abundance, and diversity of estuarine fish in relation to restored oyster reefs will improve our understanding of oyster reefs as essential fish habitat.

The vessel can also be trailered to access points along the North Carolina coast and beyond and will be available to the oceanographic research community at large for research on the eastern seaboard. Scientific research conducted from the vessel will focus on the Cape Hatteras offshore region and the coastal ocean and the Albemarle-Pamlico Sound estuarine system. The Labrador Current and Gulf Stream converge at Cape Hatteras, creating a dynamic oceanographic feature in which warm and cool waters mix. The Cape Hatteras region continues to receive scientific attention as a biogeographic barrier between the Western North Atlantic Warm and Temperate (Carolina) and Boreal provinces, as a zone of high primary productivity and micro-zooplankton grazing, as a source of carbon flux to slope sediments, and as an area of on-going and projected commercial interests. Research projects using the vessel include study of the distribution, abundance, population structure, acoustic ecology, and behavior of pelagic cetaceans in the Hatteras region, the ecological physiology of transparent midwater organisms, and transport mechanisms of commercially important species spawned offshore to inshore nursery grounds and transport of pollutants from offshore activities into sensitive inshore habitats. Broader Impacts Research undertaken from the new vessel will focus on biophysical studies that can be used to inform assessment of environmental impacts across jurisdictional boundaries and inform management and policy decisions. Wind farms, military training activities, fisheries, shipping, oil and gas development, mineral extraction, and living resource protection continue to expand into near-shore and off-shore waters; the vessel will enable studies of the biological consequences of these and other human activities and of the dynamics and processes of pelagic and benthic ecosystems. Near-shore and off-shore research will address national priorities relating to stewardship of natural ocean resources through studies of the abundance, and distribution of marine species (including endangered marine mammals and sea turtles), their relationships to habitats and other species, and the impacts of human activity on these taxa, especially within the context of predictive modeling in response to environmental change. The Marine Laboratory has vigorous undergraduate and graduate training programs and most students in these programs engage in field research with their faculty mentors. Students working on near-shore and offshore studies will be trained in seamanship and at-sea research methods using this vessel.

The main focus is on the reduction of emitted high frequencies, approximately greater than 200 Hz, which are normally not useful for seismic imaging. Therefore, potential ways to reduce the high frequencies from air guns are investigated and the development of alternative source types has increased. We have investigated the impact of bubble curtains on the source signature from seismic air guns because bubble curtains are known tomitigate high frequencies in other applications, e.g., pile driving for offshore wind farms. We have conducted tank experiments with two different configurations of bubble curtains around a single air gun and compared the results to the conventional source signature without a bubble curtain. The two different bubble curtains vary in size and in the way they are attached to the air gun. The amount of injected air into the bubble curtains is varied for both configurations. We compare the measured results to simulated data using a common model for air-gun source signatures. The results indicate a reduced peak amplitude with increasing air injection through the bubble curtain. This corresponds to a gradually decreasing frequency content for frequencies greater than 50 Hz. The frequencies of the source signal of less than 50 Hz are practically unaffected by the bubble curtain. In addition, the bubble time period of the source signal is slightly increased with an increasing amount of air injection through the bubble curtain. The main cause for the reduced peak amplitude is likely to be a buffer effect of the bubble curtain on the released air. Hence, a bubble curtain concentrated around the air-gun ports could be an efficient and practical solution to reduce the high-frequency acoustic emission from air guns.",,,,,,,,,2,0,0,0,0,0,2,,,0016-8033,1942-2156,,,,,,,,,,"NTNU, Dept Geosci & Petr, N-7031 Trondheim, NorwayNTNU, Dept Elect Syst, N-7491 Trondheim, Norway",,,,2020-04-03,WOS:000519538200045,,

In this study, sediment samples collected at increasing distance from an offshore gas platform before, during and after its construction were subjected to chemical analysis and assessment of benthic communities. Ecological indices were calculated to evaluate the ecological status of the area. Ecotoxicological analysis of sediment was performed to establish whether pollutants are transferred to biota. The study applied a before-after control-impact design to assess the effects of rig construction and presence and provide reference data on the possible impacts of any further expansion of the gas extraction industry in the already heavily exploited Adriatic Sea. Only some of the metals investigated (barium, chromium, cadmium, and zinc) showed a different spatial and/or temporal distribution that may be platform-related. In the early phases, the sediment concentrations of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons were below the detection limit at all sites; they then became detectable, but without significant spatial differences.

Agardh [with a projective cover (PC) of 70-90%] and the mono-dominant C. vermilara community (PC 80-100%). This is the first record of the Cystoseira and Codium communities in the marine area adjacent to the central part of Dzharylgach Island. These communities inhabit anthropogenic solid substrates at the depth of 0.5-2.5 m with a total area of about 100 m(2). In total, 30 species of macroalgae (comprising one-third of all macroalgae species registered for Dzharylgach Bay) were identified: Rhodophyta - 16 species (53%), Chlorophyta - 8 (27%), and Ochrophyta (Phaeophyceae) - 6 (20%). All of them are registered in the Cystoseira community; in the Codium community only 10 species were found. Algoflora of the investigated area is predominantly oligosaprobic (63% of species); according to salinity, marine species dominate (63%). The rare fraction includes 8 species (7 species are listed in the Red Data Book of Ukraine and one species in the Black Sea Red Data Book); 11 species are first cited for Dzharylgach Bay. The biotope formed by those macrophyte communities is subject to EU Habitats Directive (92/43/EEC) and the Bern Convention. In the area where mobile sandy soils dominate, the formation of a quasi-natural vegetation is noted locally on anthropogenic hard substrate.

This study utilizes agent-based computer modeling to explore the different spatial scenarios of coral transplantation using corals with contrasting r- and K-selected life histories. Spatial indexes are used to compare coral cover and topographic complexity at incremental time scales, within which disturbance events are of minor importance in spatial structuring.

The resulting habitats created were visually surveyed during an eight-month period, and a total of 26 species, belonging to 16 families, were observed. Diplectrum formosum, Orthopristis ruber, Haemulon aurolineatum and Paralabrax dewegeri were the first species to be found in every station, being also the most common species found during the survey. The highest diversity value was found in station number 3 (2,89 bits/ind) in February 2008, and the lowest value (0,73 bits/ind) was found in station number 2 in September 2007. Due mainly to the exceptional calculated values of station 3, a significant difference in the diversity value was observed among the stations; however the differences between the monthly surveys were not significant. The highest equitability value found was 0.95 at station 4 in February 2008, and the lowest value of 0,28 was found at station 2 in September 2007. In reference to the dominance, no statistical difference was found among the four stations, or between the different monthly surveys. The highest number of species found was 17 at station 3 in February 2008, while the lowest number of species (4) occurred during November 2007 and January 2008 in station 4. According to this parameter, significant differences were found among the stations, caused by the exceptional results obtained from station 3, but there were no differences between the months. In conclusion, the significant differences found at station 3, both in the number and in the diversity of species could have been caused by the near location of a fish and mollusk aquaculture facility, which might have attracted young and adult fish that could have then migrated to the artificial habitat, thus raising the values of the evaluated parameters at station 3.

As a result, justification for management activities increasingly asks for two lines of evidence: (1) biological proof of augmented ecosystem function or service, and (2) monetary valuation of these services. For oyster reefs, which have seen significant global declines and increasing restoration work, the need to provide both biological and monetary evidence of reef services on a local-level has become more critical in a time of declining resources. Here, we quantified species biomass and potential commercial value of nekton collected from restored oyster (Crassostrea virginica) reefs in coastal Louisiana over a 3-year period, providing multiple snapshots of biomass support over time. Overall, and with little change over time, fish and invertebrate biomass is 212% greater at restored oyster reefs than mud-bottom, or 0.12 kg m(-2). The additional biomass of commercial species is equivalent to an increase of local fisheries value by 226%, or $0.09 m(-2). Understanding the ecosystem value of restoration projects, and how they interact with regional management priorities, is critical to inform local decision-making and provide testable predictions.

To validate these lab results, an in situ field experiment was carried out on board of a pile driving vessel. Juvenile European sea bass (Dicentrarchus labrax) of 68 and 115 days post hatching were exposed to pile-driving sounds as close as 45 m from the actual pile driving activity.

The objective of this study is to compare the ability to sample reef fish communities at the same locations using two techniques based on the same stationary point count method: one using Underwater Visual Census (UVC) and the other rotating video (STAVIRO). UVC and STAVIRO observations were carried out on the exact same 26 points on the reef slope of an intermediate reef and the associated inner barrier reefs. STAVIRO systems were always deployed 30 min to 1 hour after UVC and set exactly at the same place. Our study shows that; (i) fish community observations by UVC and STAVIRO differed significantly; (ii) species richness and density of large species were not significantly different between techniques; (iii) species richness and density of small species were higher for UVC; (iv) density of fished species was higher for STAVIRO and (v) only UVC detected significant differences in fish assemblage structure across reef type at the spatial scale studied. We recommend that the two techniques should be used in a complementary way to survey a large area within a short period of time. UVC may census reef fish within complex habitats or in very shallow areas such as reef flat whereas STAVIRO would enable carrying out a large number of stations focused on large and diver-averse species, particularly in the areas not covered by UVC due to time and depth constraints.

However, severe storms provide an unpredictable source of mortality for benthic organisms and may strongly influence community composition. Although the importance of storm events is well demonstrated in intertidal and shallow subtidal areas, the effects on offshore, deeper-water communities is still poorly understood. We examined changes in infaunal communities associated with artificial reef systems located 20 miles off the Gulf of Mexico coast of Florida (13 m depth) after a severe storm event. Approximately one third of common fauna exhibited a significant decline in abundance after the storm. Most effects were restricted to surface-dwelling fauna (tube builders, juvenile bivalves, epifauna) with no significant changes in the abundance of the deep-burrowing guild. There was no detectable interaction of reef presence with storm effects and no consistent pattern of change in sediment grain size after the storm. Despite the influence of the storm on abundances, the infaunal community before the storm was more similar to that after the storm than to samples taken from the same sites during the same time period of the previous year.

There is increasing interest among marine ecologists in determining the importance of post-settlement processes to reef fish demography. This study distinguishes movement as an important post-settlement phenomenon affecting estimates of early survivorship of juvenile coral reef fishes. Individuals settling onto artificial patch habitats were collected, marked, released and monitored by visual census over 2 systems of isolated artificial patch habitats. Some recently settled juvenile fish moved as much as 100 m over open sand. Probability of movement was dependent on species; size was a significant factor among species, but not among conspecifics. Survivorship calculated from observations of uniquely marked individuals was contrasted with survivorship estimated by comparing the initial number of newly settled individuals at a site with the number of individuals there after a given time interval. The comparison revealed that new settlers and immigrants can mask the loss of individuals included in the original census and thereby inflate estimates of survivorship. Comparing survival estimates with and without accounting for movement demonstrated that survivorship can be underestimated when new settlers subsequently emigrate and survive at another site, but are unwittingly recorded as lost due to mortality. Significant differences were observed in survival experiences for different species and size classes. Where significant differences were found in survival times of mobile individuals versus sedentary, those that moved survived longer.",,,,,,,,,67,1,0,0,34,0,71,,,0171-8630,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1997-01-01,WOS:A1997XB24200007,,

These were the first dives to document the habitat, benthic fauna, and fish diversity of some of these poorly known deep-water reefs. Fifty-eight fish species and 142 benthic invertebrate taxa were identified. High-definition topographic SEABEAM maps and echosounder profiles were also produced. Sites included in this report range from South Carolina on the Blake Plateau to the southwestern Florida slope: 1) Stetson Lophelia reefs along the eastern Blake Plateau off South Carolina; 2) Savannah Lophelia lithoherms along the western Blake Plateau off Georgia; 3) east Florida Lophelia reefs, 4) Miami Terrace escarpment in the Straits of Florida; 5) Pourtales Terrace off the Florida Keys; and 6) west Florida Lophelia lithoherms off the southwestern Florida shelf in the Gulf of Mexico.

It concludes with a summary of commonly used habitat mapping technologies. Benthic (seafloor) habitats are physically distinct areas of seabed that are associated with particular species, communities, or assemblages that consistently occur together. Benthic habitat maps are spatial representations of physically distinct areas of seabed that are associated with particular groups of plants and animals. Habitat maps can illustrate the nature, distribution, and extent of distinct physical environments and, importantly, they can predict the distribution of the associated species and communities.The data sets collected for constructing habitat maps provide fundamental information that can be used for a range of management and industry applications, including the management of fisheries, spatial marine environmental management, design of marine reserves, supporting offshore oil and gas infrastructure development, port and shipping channel construction, maintenance dredging, tourism, and seabed aggregate mining. Seafloor habitat mapping provides fundamental baseline information for decision makers working in these sectors.GeoHab (www.geohab.org) is an international association of marine scientists conducting research using a range of mapping technologies in the study of biophysical (i.e., geologic and oceanographic) indicators of benthic habitats and ecosystems as proxies for biological communities and species diversity. Using this approach, combinations of physical attributes of the seabed identify habitats that have been demonstrated to be effective surrogates for the benthic communities that they typically support. Thus, management priorities can be identified using seabed habitat maps as a guide. The work of GeoHab demonstrates how knowledge of seabed properties can be employed to guide marine environmental management, marine resource management, and conservation efforts.Seafloor geomorphology is one of the most useful physical attributes of the seabed mapped and measured by GeoHab scientists. Different geomorphic features (e.g., submarine canyons, seamounts, atolls, and fjords) are commonly associated with particular suites of habitats. Knowledge of the geomorphology and biogeography of the seafloor has improved markedly over the past 10 years. Using multibeam sonar, submarine features such as fjords, sand banks, coral reefs, seamounts, canyons, and spreading ridges have been revealed in unprecedented detail. The 57 case studies presented in this book represent a range of seabed geomorphic features where detailed bathymetric maps have been combined with seabed video and sampling to yield an integrated picture of the benthic communities that are associated with different types of benthic habitat.",,,,,,,,,58,1,0,0,22,0,60,,,,,978-0-12-385141-3; 978-0-12-385140-6,,,,,,,,,"Geosci Australia, Marine & Coastal Environm Grp, Canberra, ACT, AustraliaUniv Sydney, Arendal Sch Geosci, UNEP GRID, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia",,,,2012-01-01,WOS:000322237000003,,

Here we describe the breeding and non-breeding social organisations of a temperate protogynous goby, Coryphopterus nicholsii, in the light of this prediction. Our results confirm that C. nicholsii has a stable social organisation, based on the year-round defence of a territory by both females and males. As predicted, larger individuals of both sexes were more likely to defend territories than smaller ones. These territories always included one or more shelter rocks, which were used as refuges by both sexes throughout the year, and also as nest sites by males in the breeding season. We then use experimental manipulation of shelter rock availability to examine the influence of intraspecific competition on territory establishment by smaller males. Following the removal of resident, non-nesting males, territories were quickly taken over. In addition, artificial reefs and nest sites were quickly colonised. Therefore, it appears that suitable shelter rocks are limited. Furthermore, intraspecific competition is strongly size-specific in C. nicholsii and determines which individuals gain access to shelter rocks. The presence of these social conditions is consistent with the prediction that the ability of larger males to monopolise more than one mate affects the occurrence of protogyny in some animals, and may clarify the occurrence of protogyny in C. nicholsii.",,,,,,,,,30,1,0,0,26,0,35,,,0378-1909,,,,,,,,,,,"Univ British Columbia, Dept Zool, Vancouver, BC 1Z4 V6T, CanadaAgr Univ Wageningen, Inst Anim Sci, Expt Zool Grp, NL-6709 PG Wageningen, Netherlands",,,,2000-04-01,WOS:000085550100006,,
J,,,,,,,,,,,Improving detection and estimation of birds collision risk with energy infrastructure,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Awarded Grant,Sep 30 2018,2018,"New tracking technologies have enabled researchers to unravel previously unknown animal movement strategies and migratory routes. The use of animal tracking devices that collect high temporal and spatial precision data, including altitude information has been increasing in recent years. Altitude data is necessary to estimate birds' collision risk with offshore wind turbines, electricity cables or other energy infrastructure. This information is key and part of the decision-making process for proposed renewable developments. Areas with high collision risk should be avoided. This project has two components, first it will examine existing animal movement data, from devices that provide accurate elevation information and will examine bird collision risk with the energy infrastructure in Europe. This is important to identify areas with high collision risk that need mitigation actions. The second part of the project will focus on the development of new technology to determine when a bird actually collides. The devices will be tested during the PhD and the results of this project will open new avenues for identification of risk of collision, an issue that is increasing in importance worldwide. We will use data on the movement of migratory birds from a variety of projects freely available on Movebank. Movement characteristics (altitude, speed, direction, flight type and distance moved) will be used to determine locations of high collision risk. This project will also take advantage of existing high temporal and spatial resolution data from ~80 white storks and will use newly developed features to identify collision events. The student will be involved in the development of the new features. The collision risk with energy infrastructure will be determined using GIS approaches. The student will benefit from the expertise in data analyses and field techniques provided by the supervisory team and collaborating partners.The NEXUSS CDT provides state-of-the-art, highly experiential training in the application and development of cutting-edge Smart and Autonomous Observing Systems for the environmental sciences, alongside comprehensive personal and professional development. There will be extensive opportunities for students to expand their multi-disciplinary outlook through interactions with a wide network of academic, research and industrial / government / policy partners. This project will train the PhD student on the interface between ecology and engineering. The student will be involved in assembling and testing tracking devices, and will be able to assess their performance in lab conditions and in the field, by deploying the devices on birds. - Assembling testing tracking devices (HWU and UEA)- Deployment of tracking devices storks (UK/Portugal)- Movement and behavior data analyses and interpretation (UEA)- GIS analyses of the collision risk (UEA).",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,2105436,,,,,,,,University of East Anglia,,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:15368687,,

For seabirds, MPAs include those near breeding colonies, offshore foraging areas, inshore habitats for wintering species, and migratory bottlenecks. However, frequently there is a lack of readily available current and comprehensive data on foraging areas used by species from particular colonies. Therefore, representative breeding season foraging ranges for each species may be useful alongside other datasets for scoping candidate MPAs. We reviewed studies that estimated foraging range for 25 species of UK breeding seabirds. For representative foraging ranges, we prioritised studies, giving highest value to those based on direct tracking of birds (21%); then those involving indirect estimates using flight speeds and time activity (12%) followed by, boat, aerial, and land-based 'survey' observations (46%); and finally we gave lowest value to speculative estimates (21%). Highest confidence was placed in the foraging ranges of northern gannet (Morus bassanus), black-legged kittiwake (Rissa tridactyla), and common guillemot (Uria aalge), and lowest for common gull (Larus canus), common eider (Somateria mollissima), Leach's (Oceanodroma leucorhoa) and European storm petrels (Hydrobates pelagicus). Both annual and colony-specific variation was evident for some species. Manx shearwater (Puffinus puffinus), northern gannet, and northern fulmar (Fulmarus glacialis), had the largest foraging ranges (maximum ranges >330, 590 and 580 km, respectively), whereas red-throated diver (Gavia stellata) and little tern (Sternula albifrons) had the smallest (maximum ranges 9 and 11 km, respectively). Representative foraging ranges may be useful to suggest likely colony-specific foraging areas, prior to habitat-association modelling for defining candidate MPAs. The approach here has international applicability, and would help progress towards more comprehensive protection of seabird populations. (c) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

We quantified the spatiotemporal variation in eastern oyster Crassostrea virginica recruitment, density, growth, and survival and assessed density dependence within a network of no-take reserves in Pamlico Sound, North Carolina. From 2006 to 2008, average oyster recruitment and total density increased 15- and fivefold, respectively. The unprecedentedly high oyster densities in certain reserves (up to 6,500/m(2) at the end of the study) modified demographic rates such that further density increases were regulated by density-dependent survival. Oyster demographic rates varied significantly among reserves at relatively small spatial scales (20 km). Certain reserves were the strong recruiters, others the fast growers, and yet others the high survivors. Cohort dynamics altered the demographic rank order such that the demographically best reserves varied intra- and interannually. From a management perspective, the prevalence of density-dependent survival suggests that the oysters in this system are habitat rather than recruitment limited, which may minimize the utility of stock enhancement programs. Addition of habitat (i.e., artificial reefs) should focus on reserves characterized by high recruitment but density-dependent growth and survival.

Of the various types of ocean energy (wave, tidal, offshore wind, salinity gradient and thermal gradient), this paper is focused on technologies with which to harness the energy from ocean currents. This energy will have considerable possibilities in the future thanks to its high predictability and its enormous potential for the production of electricity. Most of the review papers concerning tidal energy systems are focused on engineering topics. However, there continues to be limited information as regards other aspects, such as those of an economical, social, political, legislative and environmental nature which, together with their interrelationships, need to be dealt with as a whole in order to detect the key drivers that could affect the success or failure of making tidal energy technologies marketable. The objective of this review paper is to address this gap by providing a detailed strategic analysis based on the most up-to-date literature, reports and guidelines. The paper discusses the different disciplines of which the PESTEL analysis (political, economical, social, technological, environmental and legal) is composed and provides different strategies/recommendations through which to mitigate many of the risks identified in order to facilitate the successful development of these technologies and bring them onto the market.

Areas with defined benthic conservation objectives may include benthic species (demersal fishes and invertebrates); benthic habitats (spawning, nursery and feeding grounds), and Sensitive Benthic Areas (SBAs) (corals, sponges, canyons, seamounts and hydrothermal vents). SBAs are cornerstones of deep-sea biodiversity and ecosystem functioning, forming complex habitats and providing other biota with food and nutrients, refuge from predators, nursery grounds, hard surfaces for invertebrates, and structures for sessile organisms. Potential impacts of the following exploration and production activities are described: seismic, electromagnetic and seabed surveys; placement and presence of seabed infrastructure; exploration and development drilling discharges; and treatment and discharge of produced water. While other activities have the potential to impact areas with defined benthic conservation objectives (e.g., accidental events, decommissioning), this review focuses on routine operational activities. Mitigation measures to reduce potential impacts and associated pros and cons are identified and emerging drilling and production technologies and management strategies are highlighted. Considerations in acquiring seabed imagery and establishing setbacks in areas with defined benthic conservation objectives are also discussed. There remain substantial uncertainties regarding the impacts of routine marine oil and gas exploration and production activities, perhaps particularly on benthic species and habitats. The implementation of mitigation measures, management protocols and technological innovations may reduce impacts of marine oil and gas exploration and production on benthic species and habitats; however, there is a dearth of literature on their effectiveness. Increasing our understanding of pathways of effects, thresholds and potential impacts should facilitate the development and implementation of management strategies and mitigation measures that are both effective and practical. This is of particular importance when contemplating oil and gas activities in areas with defined benthic conservation areas, given their inferred or established vulnerability to anthropogenic activities.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,1499-3848; 1919-5044,,,,,,,,,,,"Paita Environm Consulting Inc, 34 Fernbrook Court, Dartmouth, NS, B2X 3V5, Canada",,,,2020-09-28,ZOOREC:ZOOR15610071271,,

The socio-economic challenge is the increasing energy need in emerging economies, such as China, which causes grave air pollution and CO2 emissions. The project work focusses on China, where heavy air pollution alone is estimated to have caused 2.2million premature deaths. Sustainable energy generation, thus replacing coal-fired power plants is one of the solutions to address this problem. In China specifically, the energy demand is at its highest along the industrialised and densely populated coastal regions. The challenge for a renewable energy supply is that the solar, wind and hydro resource are primarily located in the NW and SW of China and electricity transmission via the grid is already constrained. The Chinese government therefore has identified offshore wind energy as one of the primary energy resources with a potential of over 500GW of installed capacity, capable to produce up to 1,500 TWh of electricity per year, which would offset as many as 340 coal-fired power stations. Whilst initial installations in shallow waters near the coast have been made, over 1/3rd of the resource is located in deeper water (>40m) and will require floating installations. Offshore wind energy generation is currently more expensive than fossil fuels in China, and the risk of typhoon damage is high. The project has a fourfold approach: 1.Enhanced environmental modelling to accurately determine extreme loadings; 2. Assessment of novel, porous floating offshore wind structures and active damping mechanisms; 3. Enhanced numerical modelling techniques to efficiently calculate the complex coupled behaviour of floating wind turbines; 4. Risk based optimisation of devised designs and engineering implications. This combined approach is carried through distinguished scientific research expertise and leading industry partners in the field of offshore wind. To maximise the impact and benefits of this research the project places large emphasis on knowledge exchange activities, industry liaison and the establishment of cross-country research capacity to foster the global commercial realisation of offshore floating wind energy. The project is an interdisciplinary, cross-country collaboration with leading research Universities and industry partners. The academic expertise from the University of Exeter, the University of Edinburgh and University of Bath in the areas of Environmental assessment and modelling, Hydrodynamic design, Advanced computational modelling and risk based reliability engineering is matched with Dalian University of Technology and Zhejiang University as two of the leading Chinese research institutions in Ocean Engineering and Offshore Renewable Energy. Whilst the project carries out fundamental engineering research, strong industrial partnerships in both countries will facilitate industry advice and subsequent research uptake. The strong industrial UK support for this project through the ORE Catapult, DNV-GL, ITPE is matched with wider international support through EDF (France) and DSA (Canada), as well as the Chinese project partners MingYang Wind Power Ltd (3rd largest wind manufacturer in China), the National Ocean Technology Centre, NOTC, (institutional responsibility for marine spatial planning) and the 'Shanghai Investigation, Design & Research Institute', SIDRI (State-owned offshore wind project developer in China), demonstrates the timeliness and industrial relevance of the proposed research. All partners are committed to support the establishment of a long-lasting research base to develop resilient and cost effective offshore floating wind energy systems through collaborative research and innovation efforts, as well as capacity building and knowledge exchange.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,EP/R007519/1,,,,,,,,University of Exeter,,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:15394327,,

Balancing trade-offs between local economic demands, preservation of traditional values, and maintenance of both biodiversity and ecosystem resilience is a challenge for reef managers and resource users. Consistently, growing reef tourism sectors offer more lucrative livelihoods than subsistence and artisanal fisheries at the cost of traditional heritage loss and ecological damage. Using a systematic review of coral reef fishery reconstructions since the 1940s, we show that declining trends in fisheries catch and fish stocks dominate coral reef fisheries globally, due in part to overfishing of schooling and spawning-aggregating fish stocks vulnerable to exploitation. Using a separate systematic review of coral reef tourism studies since 2013, we identify socio-ecological impacts and economic opportunities associated to the industry. Fisheries and tourism have the potential to threaten the ecological stability of coral reefs, resulting in phase shifts toward less productive coral-depleted ecosystem states. We consider whether four common management strategies (unmanaged commons, ecosystem-based management, co-management, and adaptive co-management) fulfil ecological conservation and socioeconomic goals, such as living wage, job security, and maintenance of cultural traditions. Strategies to enforce resource exclusion and withhold traditional resource rights risk social unrest; thus, the coexistence of fisheries and tourism industries is essential.

While some of these platforms are actively lit, allowing for normal working conditions throughout the night, many are unlit, illuminated only by small navigation beacons to warn vessels of their presence. In addition to producing oil and gas, these structures inadvertently serve as artificial reef habitat for a variety of GOM fish and invertebrate species. Though many fish species have been reported aggregating near these structures, this study is the first to examine changes in fish community structure in response to the structures' artificial light regimes. Baited remote underwater video (BRUV) surveys were conducted at two lit and three unlit oil and gas platforms off the coast of Louisiana to examine the effect of platform artificial lighting on fish community structure during the day, at night, and during crepuscular periods. Seventeen recreationally harvested species were observed, with red snapper (Lutjanus campechanus) being the most abundant. Statistical analysis indicated that fish community varied significantly with depth, season, type, and season by type interactions. More fish were seen at lit platforms than at unlit platforms, with the majority of individuals identified near the surface. While fish abundance at the surface remained high during the day, the numbers declined at night. This suggests that though fishes are attracted to the vertical relief of the structure, they may be avoiding the artificial light field at the surface either to escape nocturnal predation or to forage away from the platform.",,,,,,,,,20,1,0,0,15,0,22,,,0378-1909,1573-5133,,,,,,,,,,"Louisiana State Univ, Dept Oceanog & Coastal Sci, 2201 Energy Coast & Environm Bldg, Baton Rouge, LA 70803 USALouisiana State Univ, Dept Oceanog & Coastal Sci, 2247 Energy Coast & Environm Bldg, Baton Rouge, LA 70803 USANatl Pk Amer Samoa, MHJ Bldg, Pago Pago, AS 96799 USA",Natl Pk Amer Samoa,,,2018-01-25,WOS:000419462700011,,

The results suggest time rather than colony size as a primary driver of the ecological patterns of these assemblages, which were dominated by amphipods, molluscs and polychaetes. Temporal variability was linked to changes in environmental parameters, namely temperature, chlorophyll a and particulate organic carbon. Hence, temporal variability must be taken into account for the design of future biodiversity assessment studies, as different patterns may be observed depending on the sampling time. Associated epifaunal assemblages were consistently dominated by resident species (i.e. species present in all sampling periods) and a peak of rare species was observed in the transition from spring to summer following the increase in seawater temperature. Turnover was particularly high in the transition between the spring and summer periods. In both hosts, turnover was higher in the small sized colonies, which harboured less diverse and less abundant assemblages that also differed from those inhabiting larger size colonies. The high levels of diversity associated with gorgonian colonies highlight the need for the conservation of this priority habitat. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

The innovation in shore protection at the Sacred Falls site was chosen to be an offshore reef structure that could be constructed at a remote site with manpower utilizing off the shelf materials and without the use of heavy equipment. Various artificial reef shapes and materials, such as vertical lengths of high-density polyethylene (HDPE) 0.6 m (24 in) pipe, traffic barriers, and large storage units, were considered and tested in an undistorted linear scale of 1:16 (model:prototype) physical model. Modeling efforts focused on determining barrier arrangements best suited to reduce wave heights leeward of the structure. As a result of this 3-D physical model study, and due to their off the shelf nature, the YODOCK traffic barrier in a three pack was found to be a viable option for the conditions at the site. This low cost and effective erosion reduction technology has applicability in emergency and short term situations in shallow water island environments to protect infrastructure.",,,,,1st International Conference on Island Sustainability1st International Conference on Island Sustainability,20102010,Wexxex Inst Technol; Hydrog Inst Republic Croatia; WIT Transact Ecol & EnvironmWexxex Inst Technol; Hydrog Inst Republic Croatia; WIT Transact Ecol & Environm,"Island Brac, CROATIAIsland Brac, CROATIA",1,0,0,0,0,0,1,,,1743-3541,,978-1-84564-434-5,,,,,,,,,"USA, Corps Engineers, Engn Res & Dev Ctr, Coastal & Hydraul Lab, Washington, DC USA",,,,2010-01-01,WOS:000281197700018,,

As for some plant communities, sponges on Caribbean coral reefs include chemically defended species and undefended species that tolerate consumer damage. We surveyed the sponge community on the 155 in long wreck of the USS 'Spiegel Grove' (similar to 1583 m(2) deck surface), which was intentionally sunk 4 yr previously in 2002 as an artificial reef off Key Largo, Florida, USA, to determine the relative abundance of undefended and defended species on previously uncolonized habitat compared to an adjacent reef at a similar depth and with similar topography. As predicted by theory, chemically undefended sponge species were significantly more abundant (96.0%) and larger on the shipwreck than on adjacent coral reef (15.2%,; G-test, p < 0.0001). On a Subsequent survey 18 mo later, the first recruits of 6 chemically defended sponge species were discovered, suggesting that the sponge community on the wreck is in transition toward that occurring on adjacent reefs. Although more definitive replicated experiments remain to be performed, these results corroborate the resource trade-off hypothesis as applied to the evolution of chemical defenses among sponge species on Caribbean reefs.",,,,,,,,,46,0,1,0,46,1,54,,,0171-8630,1616-1599,,,,,,,,,,"Univ N Carolina Wilmington, Ctr Marine Sci, Dept Biol & Marine Biol, Wilmington, NC 28409 USAUniv Kiel, Leibniz Instr Meereswissensch, D-24105 Kiel, Germany",,,,2008-01-01,WOS:000260511800012,,
