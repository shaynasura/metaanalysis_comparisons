The design of the mooring system considered the yard operation conditions and maximum wind speed during a typhoon. In order to secure the mooring safety of Prelude FLNG under an extreme environment, a special steel structure was designed between the quay and Prelude FLNG to maintain the distance from the quay to a certain extent to avoid a collision with the inclined base. The mooring safety was also ensured by installing additional new parts on the quay. A mooring analysis and mooring safety review were performed with more rigorous modeling considering the nonlinearity of the mooring rope and fender. In order to secure additional safety of the mooring system under extreme environmental conditions, a safety assessment was conducted on the failures of the mooring components proposed in the marine mooring guidelines. Based on the results of the mooring analysis, it was confirmed that the Prelude FLNG can be safely moored even under the extreme conditions of typhoons, and a worst case scenario analysis verified that the mooring system design was robust enough. The proposed mooring analysis and design method will provide a basis for the safe mooring of ultra-large floating offshore structures of similar size in the future.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,1225-0767,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2018-03-29,KJD:ART002318153,,,,,

The place recognition and relocalization problem is more challenging in the underwater environment mainly due to three factors: 1) changes in illumination; 2) long-term changes in the visual appearance of features because of phenomena like biofouling on man-made structures and growth or movement in natural features; and 3) low density of visually salient features for image matching. To address these challenges, a patch-based feature matching approach is proposed, which uses image segmentation and local intensity contrast to locate salient patches and HOG description to make correspondences between patches. Compared to traditional point-based features that are sensitive to dramatic appearance changes underwater, patch-based features are able to encode higher level information such as shape or structure which tends to persist across years in underwater environments. The algorithm is evaluated on real data, from multiple years, collected by a Hovering Autonomous Underwater Vehicle for ship hull inspection.

Exposure of northern gannet (Morus bassanus) to multiple wind farms could affect the population because gannets are vulnerable to both displacement and collision. A critical question is whether wind-farm siting decisions can reduce cumulative exposure of gannets. We quantified how 3 different wind-farm siting scenarios would cumulatively expose gannets. Two independent gannet abundance data sets were used to ensure robustness of the analysis: 1) individual tracking data from birds captured in the mid-Atlantic region of the United States from 2012-2015 and 2) relative abundance models developed by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration from surveys conducted from 1978-2014 along the Atlantic Coast of the United States. Our results indicate that for initial development, projects sited close to shore and in shallow areas exposed gannets at the greatest rates; however, no siting scenario effectively avoided exposing gannets because of the birds' broad distribution across the outer continental shelf. These findings suggest that gannets will be cumulatively exposed regardless of siting scenario and management actions should focus on efforts to minimize adverse effects at each wind farm rather than avoiding exposure through siting decisions.

The presence of exotic species on platforms also has consequences for various platform decommissioning options in California and elsewhere (there are an estimated 7000 offshore platforms/installations worldwide), including the removal and transport of platforms for use as artificial reefs, if removals are conducted without regard for the potential transport/dispersal of these species.

Further, management concerns when employing eco-engineering projects include public opinion regarding the aesthetic value of enhanced structures. It is therefore important for ecologists working in urban systems to understand how the public connects with the environment. Here, we used surveys to quantify perceptions of marine environmental issues and attitudes towards an example of eco-engineering research from Sydney Harbour, Australia. We also evaluated the effect of disclosing the costs of enhancing seawalls to participants regarding their support for the initiative. Results showed there was high support for applied management to improve biodiversity. This result is promising for the implementation of future eco-engineering projects.

To date, there have been relatively few studies looking at the reproductive biology and health status of this invasive species. Between 2006 and 2010 sampling of a native population took place to investigate gametogenesis and reproductive cycle and to determine the impact of settlement depth on reproduction. In addition, parasite diversity and impact was assessed. A staging system to assess reproductive development was determined. The study highlighted that from year to year the tunicate could change its reproductive strategy from single sex to hermaphrodite, with spawning possible throughout the year. Depth did not impact on sex determination, however, gonad maturation and spawning occurred earlier in individuals in deeper waters compared to shallow depth and it also occurred later in A. aspersa at sites further away from the open sea. Four significant parasite groups including eugregarines, ciliates, trematodes and turbellarians were detected and prevalence of parasite infections increased in A. aspersa at sites with a reduced water flow rate. This study demonstrates the high biotic potential of this ascidian bioinvader to have a negative impact on native fauna in an introduced ecosystem, due to its highly efficient reproductive and resource allocation strategies. Artificial structures such as mooring lines can harbour large aggregations of A. aspersa, however, these manmade habitats may facilitate the colonisation and establishment of this invasive species in the benthos. Additionally, the parasite communities that A. aspersa harbour may also exacerbate its negative impact, both ecologically and economically, in an introduced area by possibly leading to the emergence of new disease in native species i.e. pathogen spillover.

Knowledge of fish species distribution over coastal areas heavily impacted by tourism over the Mexican Central Pacific is scarce. This work aims to identify the reef fish species on different coastal habitats (sand, rock, mud) present in Puerto Marques Bay. The fish community was characterized in terms of species richness, abundance, feeding behavior and was further assessed using similarity analysis. The number of species and the relative abundance of fish species recorded varied significantly among the habitats (ANOSIM test: R = 0.676, P < 0.01, 999 permutations). In rocky areas, the highest value of richness, exclusive species and the number of organisms were recorded. In comparison with soft bottoms, the complexity of hard substrates plays a significant role in reducing prey abundances and providing nesting sites and different food resources such as invertebrates and macroalgae. Mugil cephalus was the only species recorded with muddy habitat affinity, where it feeds on detritus. Predatory species like Caranx caballus, Lutjanus jordani and Lutjanus peru, generally associated with complex rocky substrates were recorded exclusively in sandy areas near to the tourist marina. Although our data do not allow to conclude the anthropogenic outcomes in the reef fish community structure, they suggest that fish assemblage from sandy bottoms could be affected by the presence of artificial structures.

Static tensile tests and creep tests were conducted on the BFRP tendons after aging subjected to salt solution. Experimental variables included the aging temperature and aging duration. The tensile strength, elastic modulus, creep strain, and creep rupture stress of the degraded BFRP tendons are analyzed and discussed. Furthermore, a scanning electron microscopy analysis was conducted to clarify the degradation mechanism of the creep behavior. The results show that the aging temperature and duration in salt solution have a negligible effect on the creep strain increase of BFRP. The ratio of the creep rupture stress to the original tensile strength of BFRP tendons aged in salt solution decreases considerably. However, the ratio of the creep rupture stress to the degraded tensile strength exhibits no degradation, which indicates that the impact of the sustained load is independent of the impact of the salt solution on the mechanical behaviors of BFRP tendons. The appearance of corrosion channels in BFRP tendons, which accelerate successive fiber-matrix debonding under a sustained load, is determined to be the main cause for the degradation of its creep behavior in salt solution. These results provide a reference for the determination of the long-term stress of BFRP tendons used in offshore structures.

One viable option that presented itself to the petroleum industry was the suction caisson foundation. Floating offshore structures are subjected not only to static uplift loads due to buoyancy, but also to low frequency cyclic loads from environmental conditions. An experimental program was undertaken to investigate the behavior of model suction caissons under simulated location-specific geotechnical and environmental conditions of the GoM (El-Gharbawy, 1998a). The effects of such parameters as the magnitude of the peak cyclic load, the inclination, and frequency of the applied load on the number of cycles undertaken by the caisson to undergo excessive displacement were examined. At peak cyclic loads greater than the long-term capacity of the caisson, caisson displacements occurred at rates proportional to the magnitude of the peak load. The static, long-term capacity (LTC) of the caisson was found to provide an upper limit on the peak cyclic load that could be withstood by the foundation before undergoing significant displacement. The effects of load inclination and oscillation frequency on the cyclic capacity were of particular interest when the peak cyclic load exceeded the long-term capacity of the caisson. The relationship between the number of cycles to a given displacement and the magnitude of the peak cyclic load was also a function of both the load inclination and oscillation frequency.",,,,,9th International Offshore and Polar Engineering Conference (ISOPE-99)9th International Offshore and Polar Engineering Conference (ISOPE-99),"MAY 30-JUN 04, 1999MAY 30-JUN 04, 1999","Int Soc Offshore & Polar Engineers; Canadian Assoc Petr Producers; Amer Soc Civil Engineers, Engn Mech Div; Korea Comm Ocean Resources & Engn; Canadian Civil Engineers, Engn Mech Div; Chinese Soc Ocean Engineers; Chinese Soc Naval Architects & Marine Engineers; Chinese Soc Theoret & Applied Mech; Russian Acad Sci; Singapore Struct Steel Soc; Norwegian Petr Soc; Inst Engineers Australia; Kansai Soc Naval Architects, Japan; IRO, Netherlands; Tech Res Ctr Finland; Soc Mat Sci, Japan; Offshore Engn Soc, UK; Ukraine Soc Mech Engineers; IFREMER, France; Scott Polar Res Inst, UK; Inst Engineers Indonesia; Brazilian Soc Naval Architects & Marine EngineersInt Soc Offshore & Polar Engineers; Canadian Assoc Petr Producers; Amer Soc Civil Engineers, Engn Mech Div; Korea Comm Ocean Resources & Engn; Canadian Civil Engineers, Engn Mech Div; Chinese Soc Ocean Engineers; Chinese Soc Naval Architects & Marine Engineers; Chinese Soc Theoret & Applied Mech; Russian Acad Sci; Singapore Struct Steel Soc; Norwegian Petr Soc; Inst Engineers Australia; Kansai Soc Naval Architects, Japan; IRO, Netherlands; Tech Res Ctr Finland; Soc Mat Sci, Japan; Offshore Engn Soc, UK; Ukraine Soc Mech Engineers; IFREMER, France; Scott Polar Res Inst, UK; Inst Engineers Indonesia; Brazilian Soc Naval Architects & Marine Engineers","BREST, FRANCEBREST, FRANCE",5,1,0,0,0,0,5,,,1098-6189,,1-880653-40-0,,,,,,,,,"Delmar syst Inc, Houston, TX 77094 USA",Delmar syst Inc,,,1999-01-01,WOS:000080987600100,,,,,

Artificial reefs may increase estuarine rocky-reef habitat, but our understanding of their ecological impact is limited. In particular, the question of whether fish on artificial structures are produced by the habitat or attracted from nearby natural rocky-reefs is of concern. We used baited remote underwater video at artificial reef sites and nearby natural reef sites to investigate the influence of artificial reefs on fish abundance in estuaries with low amounts of natural rocky-reef. We measured total fish abundance and the abundance of three species of fisheries importance (all in the family Sparidae) before artificial reef deployment (Reefballs(R)), 1 year after and 2 years after. This design was replicated in three widely separate estuaries over 4 years. During the 2 years post-deployment, abundance of Sparidae fish increased on both artificial and natural rocky-reefs, even when artificial reefs were deployed in different years and seasons. Total fish abundance increased at artificial reef sites with no evidence of change at natural rocky-reef sites. Our findings provide evidence that the fish seen on artificial reefs were not attracted from the nearby rocky-reefs and were likely 'produced' by the addition of artificial reefs in these estuaries. Artificial reefs can increase the carrying capacity in these estuaries by providing refuge that would otherwise be unavailable. Synthesis and applications. The increased fish abundance in three estuaries at both artificial reef and natural reef locations shows that purpose-built artificial reefs can be used in conjunction with restoration/protection of existing natural habitat, to increase estuarine carrying capacity and fish abundance.

After colonization periods of three and thirteen months, plates were retrieved to determine their associated fouling sessile assemblages at an early and late stage of development, respectively. Putative confounding factors (temperature, metal concentrations) were taken into account. Results: While traffic type had no detectable effect, there were strong differences in community structure between habitats, consistent across the study region. These differences were driven by non-indigenous species which contributed to 58 and 40% of the community structure in floating habitats after three and thirteen months, respectively - roughly 10 times greater than in their non-floating counterparts. Assemblages on floating structures also displayed a lower decline in similarity with increasing distance between sampling units, being thus more homogenous than non-floating habitats at the regional scale. Main conclusions: With the absence of international traffic effect, the colonization success by non-indigenous species appears to be mainly habitat-dependent and driven by local propagules. Floating structures not only provide specific niches but characteristics shared with major introduction and dispersal vectors (notably hulls), and in turn constitute important corridors to invasions and drivers of biotic homogenization at multiple scales. cf.

However, most man-made structures are poor surrogates for the habitats they replace and can strongly impact the diversity and functioning of coastal habitats. The value of coastal engineering can be enhanced by the provision of microhabitats that facilitate colonization by marine life. One step forward is moved in this research by combining species coexistence theory, resource patchiness and applied ecology in order to find ways that maximize the biological diversity of coastal defence structures. Featureless areas of a seawall were modified by the addition of microhabitats (resource) that were distributed in different configurations of patchiness. Gastropod diversity peaked at intermediate levels of microhabitat patchiness. This appeared to be driven by different patterns of resource use among species. Gastropods dispersed longer distances on unmodified seawalls than on natural rocky shores, but when microhabitats were added the dispersal decreased. The ability to find microhabitats differed among species. Our results confirm that patchiness in microhabitat distribution affects biodiversity. The extent of microhabitat patchiness could potentially be tailored by coastal engineers to meet specific conservation priorities: increasing diversity versus increasing number of individuals.",,,,,,,,,3,0,0,0,3,0,3,,,1052-7613,1099-0755,,,,,,,,,,"MARE Marine & Environm Sci Ctr, Canical, Madeira, PortugalAzorean Biodivers Grp, CE3c GBA Ctr Ecol Evolut & Environm Changes, Ponta Delgada, Azores, PortugalUniv Acores, Dept Biol, Fac Ciencias & Tecnol, Ponta Delgada, Azores, PortugalPlymouth Univ, Marine Biol & Ecol Res Ctr, Plymouth, Devon, England",MARE Marine & Environm Sci CtrAzorean Biodivers Grp,,,2019-01-01,WOS:000456804200011,,,,,

Survey effort amounted to 44 739 km during which a total of 5121 harbour porpoises was detected, including 258 calves. Our data suggest that porpoises move to distinct areas on a seasonal basis as their biological requirements change. They move into German waters in early spring, reach high numbers in early summer and move out of the area in autumn. The abundance estimates for the German exclusive economic zone and 12 n mile zone were highest in spring (55 048 animals; 95% CI: 32 395 to 101 671) and summer (49 687 animals; 95% CI: 29 009 to 96 385) and lowest in autumn with 15394 animals (95% CI: 8906 to 29 470). Important aggregation zones were detected in offshore waters: in spring, 2 hot spots, Borkum Reef Ground and Sylt Outer Reef (SOR), were identified as key foraging areas. In summer, only the large hot spot SOR persisted, causing a strong north-south density gradient. In autumn, porpoises were more evenly distributed. Most mother-calf pairs were observed during spring and summer in the SOR, underlining its importance as a foraging area when reproductive costs are high. Spatial overlap exists between important areas for porpoises and areas where offshore wind farms are currently licensed or planned. The proportion of the national stock possibly exposed to the construction noise of 18 licensed wind farms was estimated applying different scenarios.

Our bathymetric surveyed data and numerical modeling results suggest that the first run-up tsunami wave transported huge amounts of offshore sea bottom sediment and deposited it in a layer up to 4 m thick along the shoreface slope. In some places, this accreted sediment was not eroded by the backwash because of the particular arrangement of artificial structures and sand dunes. Especially, the sedimentation process and the volume of the sediment transported by the run-up waves can be examined where the influence of the backwash flow was very minor. Remarkable sedimentation attributable to the run-up wave would have occurred mainly by the deposition of the sediment particles along the slope by the run-up waves; the slope was developed toward the stoss side rather than by the settlement of the sediment from the suspension load. We estimated that considerable amounts of sediment were transported by the tsunami from the offshore sea bottom, but most were deposited not on land but in the sea. Eleven months after the tsunami, the harbor bathymetry had almost undergone complete reversion to its pre-tsunami condition, implying that the tsunami impact on permanent geomorphological landforms was limited at this harbor.

The United Kingdom has some of the largest natural resources (large waves, strong tidal currents and high winds) of any country in the world. The exploitation of these resources is critical to addressing the energy trilemma (of producing secure, cost affordable, low carbon energy). Indeed, it is likely that without marine energy the UK's ambitious 2050 carbon reduction targets cannot be met. However, Marine energy has significant challenges to overcome. Wave, tidal and wind turbines must be installed and operated in remote locations, where the water is deep and the ocean, weather and tides are highly energetic. To provide cost effective electricity, renewable energy devices must be inexpensive to manufacture, simple to install, reliable, easy to service and produce large quantities of energy. Achieving all of this within the hostile marine environment is quite a challenge, however the prize is significant, providing not only clean energy, but significant employment and export opportunities.The United Kingdom Centre for Marine Renewable Energy (UKCMER) is a virtual centre, funded under RCUK's Energy Programmes SUPERGEN initiative. UKCMER seeks to coordinate research in renewable electricity generation using the power of the waves, tidal currents and floating wind turbines. The UKCMER core comprises of The University of Edinburgh (who coordinate the programme), Cranfield University, Exeter University, Strathclyde University and Swansea University. In addition to conducting a core research programme UKCMER acts as a hub to coordinate the activities of four additional Grand Challenge projects (EP/N021452/1, EP/N021487/1, EP/N020782/1 and EP/N02057X/1) looking at specific challenges for the marine energy sector. Research in the fourth phase of UKCMER will focus on: methods to enhance the performance of tidal turbines that recognise that arrays of machines are affected by both the interactions of the water flowing passed the devices and the electrical infrastructure which collects the energy generated and sends it to the grid. The development of design tools to assist in the optimal design of wave energy converters, tidal turbines and floating wind turbines that account for the random nature of both the waves and turbulence in the marine environment. Methods to explore the response of wave energy converters, tidal turbines and floating wind turbines to extreme loading events, recognising that such events arise from a combination of steep (rather than large waves) and the state of the device when the waves reach it. Examining how the wakes of tidal turbines deployed in farms interact with each other so that the power production from the farm can be optimised. And finally, how new designs and materials can improve the structural integrity of offshore renewable energy converters. The research programme has been designed to be complementary to the existing grand challenge projects and will make use of early results from these projects.UKCMER leads the UK's international outreach activities and has developed strong links to programmes in Chile, Japan, Korea, Mexico and the USA which will be further strengthened under this grant. UKCMER staff continue to contribute to standardisation activities of the IEC helping to develop the 62600 series of international standards and contributing to the work of the International Towing Tank Conference (ITTC) and the International Ships and Offshore Structures Congress (ISSC).",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,EP/P008682/1,,,,,,,,University of EdinburghUniversity of Edinburgh,,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:15395400,,,,,

The potential interference generated by the scattering characteristics of wind turbines on radar systems is considered a significant issue and has received a lot of attention from the research community and industry alike. However, due to the geometrical complexity of the turbine structure and its enormous electrical size at radar frequencies, the study and modelling of the radar scattering presented a substantial challenge to the research community. The use of commercial Computational Electromagnetic (CEM) tools and other full-wave solvers was limited to a small number of predefined turbine orientations due to the inherent requirement of supercomputing environment or extended modelling runtimes. To accommodate for the growth in demand for renewable energy, larger wind farms are being planned for deployment further offshore -in deeper waters and less favourable seabed conditions. Floating foundations are being widely proposed to reduce costs and enable more rapid growth of offshore wind turbines. Future wind developments (Such as Hornsea Project Two and Three) included floating foundations within their Design Envelope. Some of these projects are located near a number of key shipping routes as well as offshore O&G platforms with REWS installations. To date, the effects of floating foundation on the operation and efficiency of navigational and safety radar systems operating near or within the wind farm is currently largely unknown. Large floating wind turbines will have unique scattering characteristics due to its size, construction materials, vibration profile and movements under wind loading and adverse weather/sea conditions. Floating turbines are likely to dramatically change the radar cross section and its dynamics and consequently impact radar systems.This project will study the effects of wind turbines mounted on floating foundations on offshore radar operations. The project will develop radar scattering models for the floating foundations and account for important parameters such as geometry, materials and platform movement under adverse weather conditions. This project will build on the recently awarded Supergen funding to measure and model the radar scattering from the large 7MW turbine managed by ORE Catapult. The project will analyse the measured data from the ORE Catapult turbine as well as the large dataset of wind farm/radar measurements made available to the University of Manchester by the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR) in South Africa to further develop the existing turbine models and integrate them with the new models of the floating foundations. The analysis, verification and integration of measurements with the modelling capabilities will give a good representation of future offshore turbine. This will then be used to model the static radar returns and Doppler signature generated from the turbines under typical and adverse conditions for safety critical radar operations such as navigation under poor visibility, search and rescue efforts and REWS for collision prevention with offshore O&G assets.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,EP/S012141/1,,,,,,,,University of Manchester,,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:15317426,,,,,

Theoretically, this could arrest the corrosion process if the necessary ingredients for corrosion are eliminated. It may be difficult to stop the process if efforts are not taken to address the corrosion activity directly. Therefore, the procedure may be more effective if corrosion inhibitors are applied before wrapping.

In the present study, the sediment movement pattern behind offshore structure was examined through a series of three dimensional movable bed experiments, so as to develop the numerical model which forecasts morphological change including beach erosions. The experimental results reveal that the sediment movement patterns of the beach line side and the depth region are separated at a certain boundary line. In details, at the beach side including swash zone the sediment movement becomes dominant, which is governed by a relation between depth contours and incident wave directions, while at the depth region the bed load and suspended load due to the orbit motion of waves are carried by nearshore currents, and both movements are clearly separated at a specified boundary that is related to partial standing wave from the beach.

Using the data collected from a monthly trammel net survey in Ma'an archipelago off the east coast of China, we evaluated impacts of five different habitats (artificial reefs, mussel farms, cage aquaculture, rocky reefs and soft bottom) on fish assemblages. This study suggests that artificial reefs (AR) have significantly higher species richness, abundance and diversity than mussel farms (MF) or soft bottom (SB) habitats during most seasons, and that fish taxa in the AR habitats are similar to those in the rocky reef (RR) habitats. Two different fish assemblage patterns were revealed in the study area using non-metric multidimensional scaling ordination: an assemblage dominated by reef fishes (especially by Scorpaenidae species) in AR, RR and cage aquaculture (CA) habitats and an assemblage dominated by Sciaenidae species in MF and SB habitats. We suggest that reef fishes play a key role in differentiating fish community structures in the study area. Although few differences in fish abundance and diversity were found between the CA and SB habitats, a more diverse age structure was observed in the CA habitats. A much more complex fish assemblage and enhanced population of local species were established as a result of the presence of both floating and fixed artificial structures, probably through improved survival rates.",,,,,,,,,16,2,0,0,14,0,18,,,1672-5182,1993-5021,,,,,,,,,,"Shanghai Ocean Univ, Coll Marine Sci, Shanghai 201306, Peoples R ChinaUniv Maine, Sch Marine Sci, Orono, ME 04469 USA",,,,2015-02-01,WOS:000348345700019,,,,,

Wave loading on slender members of bottom-supported jacket structures is frequently calculated by Morison's equation. Due to nonlinearity of the drag component of Morison wave loading and also due to intermittency of wave loading on members in the splash zone, the response is often non-Gaussian; therefore, simple techniques for derivation of their extreme response probability distributions are not available. To this end, the conventional time simulation technique (CTS) is frequently used for predicting the probability distribution of the extreme values of response. However, this technique suffers from excessive sampling variability and hence a large number of simulated response extreme values (hundreds of simulated response records) are required to reduce the sampling variability to acceptable levels. In this paper, a more efficient version of the time simulation technique (ETS) is introduced to derive the probability distribution of response extreme values from a much smaller sample of simulated extreme values.

There is mounting evidence for the ecological benefits of such structures, not least for marine fish. In the United States of America, MMS (particularly oil rigs) are used as reefs to successfully enhance fisheries in the so-called, Rig to Reefs programme. In Europe the opposite occurs: international regulations governing the North Sea (i.e. OSPAR Decision 98/3) require the complete removal of disused offshore installations. In the North Sea it is well known that fish aggregate at MMS and oil and gas MMS have 500 m fishery exclusion zones. So the structures act as small marine protected areas. At this scale, the total area protected is very small relative to the area occupied by commercial fish stocks in the North Sea. However, there is also evidence that aggregations of fish extend well beyond the exclusion zone, which is either a result of aggregation towards the MMS or enhanced productivity and protection resulting in fish spilling over into the adjacent area. The spillover effect is a well-known benefit of marine protected areas but has not been studied in relation to MMS in the North Sea. If this spillover is significant, then the area influence of MMS could be greater than hitherto assumed.Here, we use an unmanned surface vehicle equipped with state of the art high resolution acoustic surveying techniques to evaluate the scale of aggregation and spillover effect of fish from North Sea MMS. Data from the surveys are used to parameterise a high spatial resolution model of fish dynamics and movements which we will use test hypotheses about the whole North Sea scale effects of networks of structures, including the extent to which they arise from enhanced productivity or the protection from fishing afforded by proximity to hard substrate, and the North Sea scale consequences of their removal.. Our results will be used by oil and gas operators in the North Sea, one of which is a partner in our project, to inform their cumulative impact assessments. This will provide evidence for derogating removal, which as stated by the CEO of the Scottish Wildlife Trust, in a parliamentary committee, could result in a triple win, with ...substantial savings to the taxpayer and substantial savings to the operator. There could be a net positive effect on the environment in the retention of these sometimes highly biodiverse areas around rigs and other structures.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,NE/T010681/1,,,,,,,,University of Aberdeen,,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:15356602,,,,,

The GoM is a hub of national energy security with nearly 2,100 operational oil and gas platforms. However, as energy exploration and production moves to deeper depths in the Gulf, older platforms on the Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) are being decommissioned and provide a prime opportunity for repurposing to meet a broad spectrum of needs identified in numerous regional and national reports. Federal regulations (30 CFR S.250.1725) require that offshore platforms either be removed and salvaged or repurposed into a state's approved Rigs to Reefs Program (with more than 500 platforms in the GoM repurposed as artificial reefs to date) within one year of well shut down. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 also provides for alternative uses for existing oil and gas platforms in federal waters. With the wave of decommissioning and widely-documented needs for efficient and effective offshore infrastructure, repurposing these platforms through the MMEERSET project can help fulfill the following priorities: a) meet research needs identified in numerous regional and national reports; b) utilize an existing regulatory framework in the Energy Policy Act of 2005; c) support President Trump's 2018 Executive Order on Ocean Policy emphasizing sustainable uses of the oceans; and d) make business sense for the energy industry that owns the platforms. The MMEERSET will capitalize on the opportunity to convert existing, adaptable offshore infrastructure in the GoM. It is a nascent model project, which makes a business case, can be used to inform future efforts, and can provide the foundation of a network of converted offshore structures for research, monitoring, education, training, and technology testing.

Reclaimed land now account for more than 30% of the current land area, with a concomitant loss of original intertidal and subtidal habitats across most of the southern shoreline of Singapore mainland as well as other offshore islands. The extent of coral reefs, mangroves, mudflats, seagrass beds, estuarine reefs, sandy and rocky shores has diminished considerably, so much so that man-made habitats such as seawalls, tidal canals, swimming lagoons and other artificial structures now form significant marine habitats in their own right. These remarkable changes in the marine environment have affected marine organisms to a greater or lesser extent, based on the very limited information available on marine habitats in Singapore prior to large-scale reclamation. However, the present extent and diversity of marine life that can be observed in Singapore today is still impressive. Much remains to be discovered and deciphered in terms of their biology and ecology. New records and species new to science continue to be described, even as new coastlines are built, and organisms continually adapt to a changing environment characterized by chronic disturbance.

The methodology used is an extension of one recently developed for analyses of marine cables when being installed on the seabed or being towed. The formulation describes elastic cable geometry in terms of two angles, elevation and azimuth, which are related to Cartesian co-ordinates by geometric compatibility relations. These relations are combined with the cable equilibrium equations to obtain a system of non-linear differential equations, which are numerically integrated by fourth and fifth order Runga-Kutta methods. The inclusion of cable elasticity and the ability to consider arbitrary stored currents are key features of this analysis.

While the primary role of defence structures is protecting the coastline, consideration should be given to the biological coastal communities they support. Artificial structures are currently seen as poor habitats for marine organisms. They are constructed in harsh coastal environments, lack structural complexity, and are subjected to episodic disturbance from maintenance, reducing their suitability as habitats for coastal species. Recent work has focused on mitigating the impacts of coastal defence structures, through secondary routes such as enhancing biodiversity by encouraging colonisation of marine biota. Research thus far has focused on enhancements to improve structural complexity on the external surfaces of coastal defences. Many structures are porous with internal compartments. To date no work has been undertaken on the habitat provided by the internal surfaces of the blocks used in building structures.We investigated the role of porous coastal defence structures in habitat provision. Taking advantage of a groyne reduction from 45 m to 20 m length, we surveyed the internal environment of the structure. We also considered the impacts of maintenance activity on coastal assemblages. Our work shows that the internal environment of artificial structures provides functional habitat space supporting higher species richness and diversity than external surfaces. The more benign environment of internal surfaces protects from desiccation stress and is probably less scoured by mobile sediments, and as such is of unrealised importance to coastal assemblages. External surfaces are also subject to high levels of disturbance from maintenance activities, further limiting the potential ecological contribution this area of the artificial habitat might otherwise develop. These findings reveal the multifunctional role of porous coastal defence structures, acting as engineering protection and habitats for coastal assemblages. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

There may be more than 100 000 shipwrecks in the Baltic Sea, however to date, their effects on biodiversity by the introduction of large hard substrates in this typically low-evenness, species-poor ecosystem have received little attention. This study compared separately macrobenthic assemblages found on three different objects (an old torpedo house, a former submarine and a minesweeper) lying at various depths (2-21 m) in Puck Bay (the Gulf of Gdansk, Baltic Sea), and corresponding assemblages in soft sediments from their close (5 m away) and far vicinity (50 m away). A total of 26 taxa of macrobenthic algae, vascular plants and fauna were recorded. Nineteen species were found directly on the study objects. Nine species among them were only found on the submerged objects but none was substrate specific. At two locations clear differences in the assemblage structure between seabed in the close proximity of submerged objects and the seabed located farther apart were noted. Higher species richness, abundance and diversity (measured as Shannon-Wiener H') was recorded only in the location of the deepest object. Its high similarity (both in terms of the assemblage structure and S, N, H') with the closest neighbouring sediments may indicate a direct impact of the object on the surrounding seabed. The submerged objects generally supported a two - three times higher number of species and a similar to 25 times higher number of individuals (but not diversity) than the soft bottom in the vicinity. The shallowest object lying within the euphotic zone hosted the most species rich (on avg. 10 species/144 cm(2)) and abundant (on avg. 379 ind./144 cm(2)) assemblages.

The motion of the elastic structure is coupled with the hydrodynamic loads acting on the slender structure by the ambient flow field. An important input for such hydroelastic problems is the computation of the hydrodynamic loading per unit length experienced by the slender body. A rigorously derived improvement for the inertial loading per unit length over the commonly used Morison-type semi-empirical force (originally obtained for straight long structures in a uniform stream) is used. The structure is also allowed to undergo small (yet finite) deflections from its original reference central-line, due to a particular model of intrinsic elasticity governed by a corresponding nonlinear PDE, which corresponds to the well-known Kirchhoff rod elastic model. The system of coupled hydroelastic equations is investigated in order to derive analytically the influence of the hydrodynamic loading in a uniform stationary stream on the nonlinear stability of the straight rod. It is found that the presence of an ambient stationary stream decreases the critical parameters (critical twist) of the buckling phenomenon which is known to exist for the same rod when placed in a vacuum. Also revealed is a new type of stability loss, which is affected by viscous effects.

Eco-engineering aims to mitigate the negative ecological impacts of built infrastructure through designing structures to be multifunctional, benefiting both humans and nature. To date, the focus of eco-engineering has largely been on benefits for benthic invertebrates and algae. Here, the potential effect of eco-engineered habitats designed for benthic species on fish was investigated. Eco-engineered habitats (flowerpots) were added to an intertidal seawall in Sydney Harbour, Australia. Responses of fish assemblages to the added habitats were quantified at two spatial scales; large (among seawalls) and small (within a seawall). Data were collected during high tide using cameras attached to the seawall to observe pelagic and benthic fish. At the larger spatial scale, herbivores, planktivores, and invertebrate predators were generally more abundant at the seawall with the added flowerpots, although results were temporally variable. At the smaller spatial scale, certain benthic species were more abundant around flowerpots than at the adjacent control areas of seawall, although there was no general pattern of differences in species density and trophic group abundance of pelagic fish between areas of the seawall with or without added habitats. Although we did not find consistent, statistically significant findings throughout our study, the field of research to improve fish habitat within human-use constraints is promising and important, although it is in its early stages (it is experimental and requires a lot of trial and error). To advance this field, it is important to document when effects were detected, and when they were not, so that others can refine the designs or scale of habitat enhancements or their study approaches (e.g., sampling protocols).",,,,,,,,,32,0,0,0,25,0,36,,,2045-7758,,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Sydney, Sch Life & Environm Sci, Ctr Res Ecol Impacts Coastal Cities, Sydney, NSW, AustraliaPlymouth Univ, Sch Biol & Marine Sci, Plymouth, Devon, England",,,,2017-11-01,WOS:000415900800030,29187990,,,,

In the design process it is recognized that this environmental data is modified in the near-field by the interaction with the particular geometrical configuration of the offshore structure. This transformation of the incident wave field around and beneath an offshore structure presents a challenge for ocean engineers when specifying the wave gap elevation to avoid impact loads on the underside of the deck and inundation of the topsides. Thus, the accurate estimation of the wave crest distributions from measurements at various locations near and under the offshore structure during model test studies is essential. A semi-empirical approach is presented herein that builds upon the findings of previous studies and introduces the Method of L-moments. A three parameter model for a wave crest probability distribution function is presented and explicit relationships between the parameters of the distribution and its' first three L-Moments are established. Furthermore, three narrow-band models from earlier research studies are reviewed and compared with the new model. Wave measurements from a mini-TLP model test program are used as the basis for comparison of the four distributions. The root-mean-square error is used as a metric to quantify the overall fit of the data and its accuracy in the high end tail of the data. The L-Moment model is shown to be more robust in representing the data in both the far-field and beneath the deck of the mini-TLP where the wave field demonstrates increased non-linear behavior.

Abundance estimates, frequency of observations, and species indicators (richness and diversity) provided the basis for comparison between methods. UVC recorded significantly greater numbers of species in all estuaries and significantly greater species richness and diversity at two of the three estuaries. Variation in the number and frequency of species detected by each method directly related to the ecological niche and behaviour of each species. UVC provided better estimates of the rare or cryptic reef associated species. BRUV sampled a smaller proportion of species overall but did observe key recreational species such as Acanthopagrus australis, Pagrus auratus and Rhabdosargus sarba with increased frequency, although the presence of large numbers of schooling species such as Pelates sexlineatus reduced the detection frequency of these species. In summary, results indicate that BRUV is an effective method for recording species associated with artificial reefs with the exception of cryptic species that are located within the reef structure itself. BRUV techniques complement UVC by providing increased coverage of species known to be diver averse as well as providing important information regarding behaviour of the species identified. Given the limitation of each method, it is recommended that monitoring plans for artificial structures should adopt a multi-method approach utilising BRUV and UVC where possible.

Yet, the seabird guilds most likely at risk of cumulative effects have not been identified. Assessments of cumulative effects must first calculate the cumulative exposure of seabirds to areas suitable for offshore wind farms and then estimate how exposure will affect populations. This paper addresses this first need, and quantifies how three different wind farm siting scenarios could cumulatively expose seven seabird foraging guilds. The coastal bottom gleaner guild (sea ducks) would be exposed at similar rates regardless of siting decision, while other coastal guilds would be exposed at a higher rate when projects are built in shallow areas and close to shore rather than in high-wind areas.

Installation of shoreline protection structures is increasing in response to rising sea levels and increasing frequency of intense storms. Shoreline hardening structures can facilitate establishment of non-native species with multiple potential consequences. We measured abundances of both native and non-native Codium, a green macroalga, on natural hard substrates (oyster reefs) and artificial substrates (bulkheads and revetments) in two estuaries and assessed the effects of each Codium species on nitrogen fixation and net N-2 fluxes. Native C. decorticatum was the most abundant (86 %) Codium on oyster reefs, while exotic C. fragile dominated (99 %) artificial substrates. N-2 production via denitrification was greater than nitrogen fixation for both species and the net N-2 production associated with non-native C. fragile was greater than with native C. decorticatum. Comparing our results with surveys conducted in the 1940s before C. fragile had invaded, indicates that non-native Codium has outcompeted native Codium on artificial substrates, but that natural substrate provided by oyster reefs remains a refuge for native Codium. Although shoreline hardening with artificial structures can reduce ecosystem services provided by coastal marsh and other habitats, an unexpected beneficial consequence was the N-2 production associated with the non-native Codium, which has the potential to mitigate anthropogenic nutrient loading. Our results illustrate that the interaction between multiple anthropogenic impacts can be positive, and indicate that non-ephemeral macroalgae could be an overlooked component in nitrogen removal from marine ecosystems by enhancing denitrification.",,,,,,,,,19,0,0,0,16,0,20,,,1387-3547,1573-1464,,,,,,,,,,"Univ North Carolina Chapel Hill, Inst Marine Sci, Morehead City, NC 28557 USA",,,,2014-09-01,WOS:000339970100004,,,,,

In total, 64 seine hauls were carried out bimonthly between October 2012 and September 2013 in two beaches located within a marine-estuarine transitional zone in Guanabara Bay and <1 km apart to each other. These beaches share very similar geomorphological and hydrodynamic conditions, but the sublittoral zone of Urca Beach is more structurally-complex because of the presence of artificial structures made of concrete and beds of seagrass and drifting macroalgae, in contrast to the more homogeneous sandy substrate found in Dentro Beach. A total of 1257 fish were caught, with H. clupeola (N=640), A. brasiliensis (N=161), T carolinus (N=123) and T. goodei (N=91) accounting for the dominant species. Urca and Dentro beaches shared few similarities in terms of fish species composition, and no seasonal or spatial difference was found for fish richness, abundance, and biomass. Except for the pelagic and planktivorous H. clupeola, which were more abundant in the seine hauls performed in Dentro Beach, the other dominant fish species were more abundant in the hauls conducted in Urca Beach. These findings confirmed the hypothesis that the availability of complex habitats in the nearby sublitoral zones of sandy beaches may lead to positive effects on their associated fish assemblages probably by the increased availability of feeding and spawning sites. Our paper also revealed that water variables were also important, but their effects only explained partially the seasonal variations of few species, agreeing however with the broad consensus of the function of sandy beaches as nursery grounds. Despite the interesting applied potential for fish management, the role of complex habitats in sandy beaches should be better investigated before any measure toward habitat manipulation and enrichment were carried out.

Some limpet species achieve remarkable sizes, which in the most extreme cases can surpass 35 cm in shell length. In this review, we focus on giant limpets, which are defined as those with a maximum shell size surpassing 10 cm. According to the scientific literature, there are a total of 14 species across five genera that reach these larger sizes. Four of these species are threatened or in danger of extinction. Inhabiting the intertidal zones, limpets are frequently affected by anthropogenic impacts, namely collection by humans, pollution and habitat fragmentation. In the case of larger species, their conspicuous size has made them especially prone to human collection since prehistoric times. Size is not phylogeny-dependent among giant limpets, but is instead related to behavioural traits instead. Larger-sized species tend to be nonmigratory and territorial compared to those that are smaller. Collection by humans has been cited as the main cause behind the decline and/or extinction of giant limpet populations. Their conspicuously large size makes them the preferred target of human collection. Because they are protandric species, selectively eliminating larger specimens of a given population seriously compromises their viability and has led to local extinction events in some cases. Additionally, sustained collection over time may lead to microevolutionary responses that result in genetic changes. The growing presence of artificial structures in coastal ecosystems may cause population fragmentation and isolation, limiting the genetic flow and dispersion capacity of many limpet species. However, when they are necessitated, artificial structures could be managed to establish marine artificial microreserves and contribute to the conservation of giant limpet species that naturally settle on them.",,,,,,,,,29,0,0,0,23,0,31,,,0065-2881,,978-0-12-812402-4; 978-0-12-812401-7,,,,,,,,,"Univ Seville, Lab Biol Marina, Seville, SpainUniv Montpellier 2, Grp Fonct AEO, MARBEC, UMR 9190, Montpellier, France",,,,2017-07-04,WOS:000403551700003,28065294,,,,

Adding over 150 new settlers to three of the shelter-supplemented sites did not measurably increase juvenile lobster abundance above that attributable to shelter enhancement alone. Mark-recapture results confirmed that the observed increase in small juveniles on shelter-supplemented sites was not due to immigration. The addition of artificial structures to nursery sites appears to have reduced predation on the vulnerable small juveniles and led to their local retention. In contrast, larger, more mobile juveniles were no more abundant where shelter was added than on the unmanipulated sites.

Most of the offshore wind turbines installed to date are located in relatively shallow water and are mounted on fixed bottom support structures. Given the limitation of suitable shallow water sites available with high wind resources and also to reduce the environmental and visual impact of turbines, it is necessary to extend wind turbines to deeper water through the development of floating offshore wind turbine (FOWT) systems, which mount wind turbines on floating support platforms. The project aims to fill an important gap in the design, manufacturing and testing of emerging FOWT techniques by specifically characterising extreme loading on FOWTs under complex and harsh marine environments. These are typically represented by storm conditions consisting of strong wind, extreme waves, significant current, rising sea level and complex interplay between these elements, through a coordinated campaign of both advanced CFD modelling and physical wave tank tests. This has direct relevance to the current and planned activities in the UK to develop this new technology in offshore wind. In addition, the project aims to develop a suite of hierarchical numerical models that can be applied routinely for both fast and detailed analysis of the specific flow problem of environmental (wind, wave, current) loading and dynamic responses of FOWTs under realistic storm conditions. As an integral part of the project, a new experimental programme will be devised and conducted in the COAST laboratory at the University of Plymouth, providing improved understanding of the underlying physics and for validating the numerical models. Towards the end of the project, fully documented CFD software and experimental data sets will be released to relevant industrial users and into the Public Domain, so that they may be used to aid the design of future support structures of FOWTs and to secure their survivability with an extended envelope of safe operation for maximum power output.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,EP/T004177/1,,,,,,,,University of Plymouth,,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:15320644,,,,,
J,,,,,,,,,"Sweetman, John",,"Floating Offshore Wind Turbines: Conceptual Assessment of Highly Compliant Platforms using Theory, Design and Simulation",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Awarded Grant,Sep 01 2011,2011,"1133862 PI Sweetman The objective of this project is to develop new theory and numerical tools to accurately simulate the behavior of floating offshore wind turbines subject to large angular displacements, and use those results to assess the economic and technical feasibility of potential next-generation structures. Intellectual Merit: The potential for a change in design philosophy from highly rigid wind turbine support structures to highly compliant ones will be investigated. New designs and operational control systems will be developed that allow the tower to lean significantly in response to the wind force, and the technical and economic merits of these new designs will be assessed. A shift to highly compliant structures would be a major shift in design philosophy paralleling that of the offshore oil business as drilling and production moved into very deep water. A family of new designs will be developed with rotational restoring properties ranging from very stiff (very small lean of the tower due to wind) to very compliant (leans easily). These designs will be completed in sufficient detail to identify all challenges to existing technology. Computing the dynamics of these highly compliant structures is both difficult and important, in part because of the gyroscopic effect of the huge whirling blades. This challenge will be met through theoretical development and practical implementation of a new dynamic simulation methodology that could prove useful beyond the field of wind energy to other rotating equipment subject to large angular displacements. The new method will be based on conservation of angular momentum in Euler-space for a cloud of rigid bodies representing a floating wind turbine. Development of this new theory and simulation methodology is necessary because conventional wind turbine design tools do not consider the order of rotation of angular deflections and so are inadequate for large angular motions. Additionally, the overall system is extremely nonlinear: the environmental forcing, hydrostatic restoring moments, time-domain control system, and gyroscopic effects are all nonlinear; accurate simulation in the time domain is necessary to assess the viability of the any design concept. Proof that highly compliant support structures have both technical and economic value could begin a technical revolution that enables economic development of wind farms in very challenging deepwater offshore locations. Broader Impacts: As the US continues to work towards ``greener?? sources of alternative energy, there is increasing interest in installing wind turbines offshore, where good winds and adequate space are both available. Public pressure continues to push for having these structures beyond sight of land, and new technologies are needed for more cost-effective generation of wind-powered electricity in very deep waters. This proposal explores for the first time the viability of highly compliant structures for that purpose, the result of which could be a dramatic shift in the design philosophy for floating wind turbines. The education and outreach components include course development, education of graduate and undergraduate students and outreach to K-12 students and teachers as well as to at-risk college students. The teaching will include development of innovative course curricula on off-shore wind energy to teach about design of both bottom-founded and floating offshore wind turbines, and will include education of graduate and undergraduate students in the rapidly advancing area of offshore wind turbine design. Outreach to K?12 students and teachers will be include presentations on offshore energy by the PI and his graduate students in the well-established ``Sea Camp?? program at Texas A&M at Galveston; outreach to at-risk college students, who include many historically underrepresented and financially disadvantaged students, will be through an established program.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,1133682,,,,,,,,Texas A&M Engineering Experiment Station,,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:13505635,,,,,

An increasing interest in incorporating heterogeneity that is reflective of natural rocky shores into artificial structures through ecological engineering seeks to mitigate negative impacts. The addition of complex surfaces and novel habitats, such as water-retaining features, has been particularly successful at increasing biodiversity of marine infrastructures to date. Importantly, key habitat-forming groups, such as the complex turfing algae Corallina officinalis found on natural shores and their associated assemblages are still lacking from these eco-engineered features. Furthermore, whether observed biodiversity increases from eco-engineering are due to native or non-indigenous species remains largely unknown. Here, we investigated whether adding small-scale complexity (artificial turf) to artificial rock-pools ('flowerpots') on urban seawalls enhanced their effectiveness to increase native biodiversity. Responses of benthic invertebrates, algae, epifauna and fish in flowerpots with and without artificial turf (coir) were quantified. Contrary to existing literature, which reports an increase in biodiversity with an increase in complexity, no consistent effect of coir was seen on benthic, epifaunal or fish assemblages. Native species consistently occupied more than 95% of space in flowerpots while the proportion of non-indigenous species in flowerpots was small (<75% of the assemblage) regardless of treatment, and decreased over time. This result is promising, but warrants further investigation to determine if these trends reflect seasonal patterns or if non-indigenous species colonise early, but are replaced over time by native species. These are important considerations when planning large-scale deployments of eco-engineering features on seawalls to ensure that native species are targeted without increasing opportunities for non-indigenous species.

This chapter investigates the option of introducing a multi-use design for the Gemini site by adding mussel cultivation (48 kt wet weight per year) and seaweed cultivation (480 kt wet weight per year) to the wind farm. An institutional analysis indicates a political will in the Netherlands to support the development of adding uses to offshore wind farms, but a number of implementation obstacles are also identified. Those obstacles include an absence of licences for multi-use production and legal restrictions against third-party access to wind farms. There is therefore a need for a regulatory framework for multi-use and trust-building among actors involved in multi-use installations. A financial and economic assessment, and a cost-benefit analysis also taking into account monetized changes in CO2 emissions, indicate that adding mussel cultivation to the wind farm is likely to be both financially and socio-economically viable. Including a seaweed cultivation function is probably not financially and socio-economically viable under current technical and economic conditions. Knowledge gaps and uncertainties in these assessments with respect to, for example, missing site-specific data and non-monetized externalities suggest further research, also including pilot cultivations of mussels and seaweed in planned single-use or multi-use installations.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,978-3-319-55772-4; 978-3-319-55770-0,,,,,,,,,"Anthesis Enveco, Masholmstorget 3, SE-12748 Skarholmen, SwedenIstanbul Tech Univ, Coastal & Marine Hydrodynam Res Grp, Istanbul, TurkeyDeltares, Boussinesqweg 1,POB 177, NL-2600 MH Delft, NetherlandsIstanbul Tech Univ, Dept Civil Engn, TR-34469 Istanbul, TurkeyChalmers Univ Technol, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, SE-41296 Gothenburg, SwedenCyprus Inst, Energy Environm & Water Res Ctr, 20 Konstantinou Kavafi,2121, CY-1645 Nicosia, CyprusAthens Univ Econ & Business, Sch Econ, 76 Patiss St, Athens 10434, GreeceICRE8 Int Ctr Res Environm & Econ, Artemidos 6 & Epidavrou, Athens 15125, GreeceLondon Sch Econ & Polit Sci, Grantham Inst, Houghton St, London WC2A 2AE, EnglandWageningen UR, Wageningen Environm Res, POB 47, NL-6700 AA Wageningen, Netherlands",Anthesis EnvecoCyprus InstICRE8 Int Ctr Res Environm & Econ,,,2018-06-05,WOS:000431567000005,,,,,

The model assesses cumulative exposure by identifying all locations where development could occur, placing wind farms within this suitability layer, and then overlaying wind engineering and biological data sets. The first model output is a graphical representation of how offshore wind farm siting decisions affect wildlife cumulative exposure.

Some case studies are reviewed in order to illustrate the possible effect of common cause failures on human and organisational barriers, from incidents on offshore petroleum installations. The dependencies that are thus created are important to integrate into risk analysis studies relating to human and organisational barriers.

Assessment across all conceivable sea states requires accounting for variabilities of long-term environmental loads and short-term stochastics, traditionally captured through extensive sampling or numerical expectation integration. The amount of environmental load variables render numerical integrations across high dimensions computationally prohibitive, while industry requirements of high return periods demand large Monte Carlo samples of time domain dynamic analyses. Subset simulation offers a promising alternative to classic methods of statistical analysis, dividing ultra-low probability problems into subsets of intermediate probabilities. The methodology is uniquely advantageous for the assessment of heavy-tail overload events, which are unpredictably severe and occur at exceedingly rare frequencies. Subset simulation is experimented on a mooring case study situated in the hurricane-prone Gulf of Mexico, with the structure exposed to a joint-probabilistic description of wave, wind and current loads.

This is the so-called 20/20/20 target. The UK's target is for 15% of energy to be sourced from renewables by this date. For this target to be met, over 30% of electricity will need to be generated from renewables and it is anticipated that 31GW of this will come from wind power with 13GW onshore and 18GW offshore by 2020 to 40GW of offshore wind power capacity could be installed by 2030. At present 6GW of wind power have been installed onshore and 3GW offshore. Because of environmental concerns, the development of onshore wind power in the UK is being constrained making the cost-effective and reliable offshore development ever more important. To increase offshore capacity by at least a factor of five in seven years, whilst minimising the cost of energy, presents very significant design, operational and logistical challenges. Within the above context and in the longer term, wind farms and wind turbines will be sited further offshore in deeper water and become bigger. The proposed Supergen Wind Hub brings together leading wind energy academic research groups in UK to address the medium term challenges of scaling up to multiple wind farms, considering how to better build, operate and maintain multi-GW arrays of wind turbines whilst providing a reliable source of electricity whose characteristics can be effectively integrated into a modern power system such as that in the UK. The wind resource over both short and long terms, the interaction of wakes within a wind farm and the turbine loads and their impact on reliability will all need to be better understood. The layout of the farms, including foundations, impact on radar and power systems and shore-connection issues, will need to be optimised. The most effective and efficient operation of wind farms will require them to act as virtual conventional power plants flexibly responding to the current conditions, the wind turbines' state and operational demands and grid-integration requirements. The programme of research for the Supergen Wind Energy Hub will focus on all of the above, both at the level of single farms and of clusters of farms.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,EP/L014106/1,,,,,,,,University of Strathclyde,,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:15323683,,,,,

Among renewable energies, wind energy is the most prominent due to its low, manageable impacts on the local environment. Based on meteorological data from 2006 to 2014 and multi-source satellite data (i.e., Advanced Scatterometer, Quick Scatterometer, and Windsat) from 1999 to 2015, an assessment of the onshore and offshore wind energy potential in Jiangsu Province was performed by calculating the average wind speed, average wind direction, wind power density, and annual energy production (AEP). Results show that Jiangsu has abundant wind energy resources, which increase from inland to coastal areas. In onshore areas, wind power density is predominantly less than 200 W/m(2), while in offshore areas, wind power density is concentrates in the range of 328-500 W/m(2). Onshore areas comprise more than 13,573.24 km(2), mainly located in eastern coastal regions with good wind farm potential. The total wind power capacity in onshore areas could be as much as 2.06 x 10(5) GWh. Meanwhile, offshore wind power generation in Jiangsu Province is calculated to reach 2 x 10(6) GWh, which is approximately four times the electricity demand of the entire Jiangsu Province.

The decision to remove such structures or turn them into reefs (i.e. 'rigs-to-reefs') hinges on the habitat value they provide, yet this can rarely be determined because the residency of mobile species is difficult to establish. Here, we test a novel solution to this problem for reef fishes; the use of otolith (earstone) properties to identify oil structures of residence. We compare the otolith microchemistry and otolith shape of a site-attached coral reef fish (Pseudanthias rubrizonatus) among four oil structures (depth 82-135 m, separated by 9.7-84.2 km) on Australia's North West Shelf to determine if populations developed distinct otolith properties during their residency. Microchemical signatures obtained from the otolith edge using laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS) differed among oil structures, driven by elements Sr, Ba and Mn, and to a lesser extent Mg and Fe. A combination of microchemical data from the otolith edge and elliptical Fourier (shape) descriptors allowed allocation of individuals to their 'home' structure with moderate accuracy (overall allocation accuracy: 63.3%, range: 45.5-78.1%), despite lower allocation accuracies for each otolith property in isolation (microchemistry: 47.5%, otolith shape: 45%). Site-specific microchemical signatures were also stable enough through time to distinguish populations during 3 separate time periods, suggesting that residence histories could be recreated by targeting previous growth zones in the otolith. Our results indicate that reef fish can develop unique otolith properties during their residency on oil structures which may be useful for assessing the habitat value of individual structures. The approach outlined here may also be useful for determining the residency of reef fish on artificial reefs, which would assist productivity assessments of these habitats. (c) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

To creatively solve part of this problem, we assessed the effectiveness of mussel spat ropes for improving fish passage past perched culvert structures. We used a before-after-control-treatment design to test our hypothesis that relative abundances of 'young-of-the-year' migratory fish species would increase following rope installation in a New Zealand stream. Results following remediation indicated a significant three-to four-fold increase in fish abundance relative to a control stream. Although four species (banded kokopu (Galaxias fasciatus), redfin bullies (Gobiomorphus huttoni), longfin eels (Anguilla dieffenbachii) and shortfin eels (Anguilla australis)) were present at both the treatment and control stream sites, the increased fish relative abundance at the treatment site was driven primarily by an increase in 'young-of-the-year' banded kokopu. The present study has shown that mussel spat ropes can significantly improve fish relative abundances above severely perched culverts, but may not be effective for all species present.

This sector is characterized by numerous, extensive landslide masses and there is evidence of their reactivation during the last century. The instability phenomena can be attributed to landslides with complex kinematics classifiable as rock slump and rock topple, rock slide and rock fall, and rock fall and rock flow. They have involved hamlets and communication routes, with observable damage to man-made structures and terraced agricultural terrain, including collapses and deformations of the dry-stone walls. The geomorphological surveys, the boreholes and the monitoring activity have shown that several landslides are active, with movement rates of some cm/year.With the presence of predisposing factors relating to the structural lithology and geomorphology of the rocky slopes, the triggering causes of the gravitational movements are attributable to extreme heavy rainfall and to wave cutting, often with concomitant action on the part of both. The study offers a contribution to encourage concrete efforts to continue the monitoring of this area; the overall objective would entail the planning of general stabilization measures, or at least measures to reduce evident geomorphological risks, also taking into account the remarkable environmental value and qualities of this coastal sector.

In freshwater lakes, where early stages of salmon growth are completed, the high filter-feeding rate of the native bivalve, Diplodon chilensis, can significantly reduce the effect of salmon farming by maintaining oligo-trophic conditions. The constant movements of D. chilensis on the bottom sediment substrate generate enough bioturbation to reduce the impact of nutrient accumulation (nitrogen and phosphorus) due to salmon farming. We documented a similar mitigating effect in marine mussel (Aulacomya ater) beds, on rocky substrates in the channels and fjords where salmon are grown in pens. There is an additional benefit in such cases because A. ater is a valuable commercial resource. Artificial reefs, both in lakes and the inner sea, provide refuges for crustaceans and fish. In particular, these artificial structures enhance juvenile recruitment of invertebrates and fish. In freshwater ecosystems, native endemic crustaceans (crabs [Aegla sp.] and crayfish [Samastacus spinifrons]) are capable of processing excess food deposited on the bottom from salmon pens. Marine crabs (Cancer edwardsi) perform a similar ecological role under salmon pens in the inner sea. In summary, artificial reefs provide a way to link salmon farming with bottom heterogeneity and thus reduce the impacts of the salmon farms by facilitating the incorporation of organic matter into benthic productivity. Excess food is utilized around salmon-farm pens by both native fish and escaped salmon. These fishes, in turn, are prime targets for sport fishing, which, if managed in an appropriate way, could become an effective way to remove assimilated nutrients and organic matter via the removal of fish, which are at the top of the food web. This practice would have the additional benefit of removing salmon that have escaped from culture pens, particularly if the fishery was conducted around the pens.",,,,,Symposium on Ecological and Genetic Implications of Aquaculture Activities held at the Annual Meeting of the World-Aquaculture-SocietySymposium on Ecological and Genetic Implications of Aquaculture Activities held at the Annual Meeting of the World-Aquaculture-Society,"MAY 04-05, 2000MAY 04-05, 2000",World Aquaculture SocWorld Aquaculture Soc,"Nice, FRANCENice, FRANCE",9,0,0,0,5,1,9,,,1571-3075,,978-1-4020-0884-9,,,,,,,,,"Univ Austral Chile, Fac Pesqueiras & Oceanograf, Puerto Montt, SpainUnive San Sebastia, Puerto Montt, Chile",Unive San Sebastia,,,2007-01-01,WOS:000252239300026,,,,,

Jack-up site assessment has seen significant advances over the 50 or more years that jack-ups have been deployed offshore. The advances have occurred as a result of both the improvements that have been seen in the analytical tools and also as a result of the many significant strides in our understanding of the physics of the jack-up and the ocean environment. Jack-ups, due to their semi-compliant nature, pose particularly difficult challenges to the designer and operator - more so than most offshore structures. This requires cutting edge technologies to assure that practical solutions can be reached without either too much conservatism or too little safety. These advances have often occurred, or been encouraged, as a result of the engagement of the operators hiring the jack-ups and their technical overseers such as Jan Vugts. Jan was instrumental in initiating the Shell study into jack-up site assessment that resulted in a follow-up JIP which developed the SNAME Recommend Practice.

In contrast, a greater material input, leading to increased energy consumptions and emissions during the production phase, is required to build offshore wind farms. These contrary effects are investigated for the first German offshore wind farm alpha ventus in the North Sea. In a life cycle assessment its environmental influence is compared to that of Germany's electricity mix.In comparison to the mix, alpha ventus had better indicators in nearly every investigated impact category. One kilowatt-hour electricity, generated by the wind farm, was burdened with 0.137 kWh Primary Energy-Equivalent and 32 g CO(2)-Equivalent, which represented only a small proportion of the accordant values for the mix. Furthermore, the offshore foundations as well as the submarine cable were the main energy intensive components. The energetic and greenhouse gas payback period was less than one year.Therefore, offshore wind power, even in deep water, is compatible with the switch to sustainable electricity production relying on renewable energies. Additional research, taking backup power plants as well as increasingly required energy storage systems into account, will allow further calculation. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

The modeling of such structures poses many challenges because of the flexibility of the riser/mooring system, fluid-structure interaction and random nature of wave loads. Tensioned beam finite elements can be used for structural modeling of line elements. Computational fluid dynamic modeling may be used to firm up hydrodynamic coefficients required in the Morison equation for the estimation of fluid loads on structural elements, as well as to evolve simplified models to represent vortex-induced motions. While wave-body interaction of large-volume structures may be modeled using computational fluid dynamic tools, the use of numerical models employing the fully nonlinear potential flow theory is worth exploring. Simpler analytical models for use in design analysis may be developed by employing coupled models based on nonlinear structural finite element methods and computational fluid dynamic tools.

The impedance-based SHM is a kind of local SHM techniques and to date, numerous techniques and algorithms have been proposed for local SHM of real-scale structures. However, it still requires a significant challenge for practical applications to compensate unknown environmental effects and to extract only damage features from impedance signals. In this study, the impedance-based SHM was carried out on a 1/20-scaled model of an Uldolmok current power plant structure in Korea under changes in temperature and transverse loadings.

Using an energetic modelling approach, we examine the effects of wind farms as barriers to movement on seabirds of differing morphology. Additional costs, expressed in relation to typical daily energetic expenditures, were highest per unit flight for seabirds with high wing loadings, such as cormorants. Taking species-specific differences into account, costs were relatively higher in terns, due to the high daily frequency of foraging flights. For all species, costs of extra flight to avoid a wind farm appear much less than those imposed by low food abundance or adverse weather, although such costs will be additive to these. We conclude that adopting a species-specific approach is essential when assessing the impacts of wind farms on breeding seabird populations, to fully anticipate the effects of avoidance flights.

These structures provide hard-bottom habitat in areas previously dominated by sand or mud, so they have the potential to alter species distributions or serve as stepping-stones between other hard-bottom habitats. It is thus important to understand what factors influence the composition and abundance of benthic fauna recruiting at these sites. We examined recruitment to hard substrata (fouling panels) deployed on sand at various distances from a large rocky reef (similar to 60 m isobath) on the southern Oregon coast in 2014-2015. Recruitment was dominated by the acorn barnacle Hesperibalanus hesperius. For the majority of the study period in 2014, an anti-cyclonic eddy was present near the deployment sites. However, anomalously high recruitment of H. hesperius during August - early October 2014 coincided with dissipation of the eddy, slower bottom currents, and a positive convergence index, suggesting that H. hesperlus larvae from the adjacent area may have been accumulated and retained near our study sites. Other sessile species, including hydroids and bryozoans, recruited to the fouling panels in low abundances, and most of these species have long-range dispersal and fast growth. Mobile invertebrates observed on the fouling panels included gastropods and nudibranchs, most of which also have long-range dispersal and fast growth, and are predators as adults. Thus, a community with two trophic levels assembled on the fouling panels in a relatively short time period (< 12 weeks). None of the common hard-bottom species from the adjacent rocky reef recruited to the panels, suggesting that there is a specialized assemblage of species that can exploit hard-bottom habitats surrounded by sandy plains.

The results indicated that after OWF construction, detritus, phytoplankton, zooplankton, anchovies, and some benthic fish were positively impacted. The increased primary production and detritus resulted in the increased food supply for zooplankton, which made it possible for planktivorous species (particularly anchovies) to be fed. Consequently, the biomass and production of some benthic fish increased, which indicates a potential reef effect. Other groups with decreased biomasses and productions may have been negatively impacted by the OWFs. Herbivory flows dominated the pre- and post-construction JCE despite their low transfer efficiencies; however, the proportion of detritivory flow increased after OWF construction, and this was especially prominent at high trophic levels.

There are no published reports or systematic analysis of the cost of explosive cutting and so this analysis should serve as a useful industry baseline. The elements of a standard contract are presented and the total cost of the operation is derived in terms of the parameters of the contract. The percentage contribution of the fixed cost of service to the total cost is then estimated based on an assessment of average contract parameters. The total cost to perform an explosive severance operation is aggregated according to job type and normalized according to the number, size, and length of cut performed. Descriptive statistics are provided and relations are derived that estimate the time and cost of cutting based on various descriptor variables. The expected size and potential value of the explosive severance market in the Gulf of Mexico is also estimated. A major conclusion of the analysis is that explosive severance is a time-invariant structure-dependent operation and this combination of time invariance and structure dependence is one of the primary reasons for the popularity of explosive severance. Contractors essentially know the cost of an explosive severance operation before performing the job and this certainty of operation is an extremely valuable characteristic from an operational and financial perspective.

For the North Sea, the oil and gas industry has been a dominant presence for over 50 years that has contributed to a wealth of knowledge about the environment. As the industry begins to decommission its offshore structures, this information will be critical for avoiding duplication of effort in data collection and ensuring best environmental management of offshore activities. This paper summarises the outcomes of a Blue Growth Data Challenge Workshop held in 2017 with participants from: the oil and gas industry; the key UK regulatory and management bodies for oil and gas decommissioning; open access data facilitators; and academic and research institutes. Here, environmental data collection and archiving by oil and gas operators in the North Sea are described, alongside how this compares to other offshore industries; what the barriers and opportunities surrounding environmental data sharing are; and how wider data sharing from offshore industries could be achieved. Five primary barriers to data sharing were identified: 1) Incentives, 2) Risk Perception, 3) Working Cultures, 4) Financial Models, and 5) Data Ownership. Active and transparent communication and collaboration between stakeholders including industry, regulatory bodies, data portals and academic institutions will be key to unlocking the data that will be critical to informing responsible decommissioning decisions for offshore oil and gas structures in the North Sea.",,,,,,,,,26,0,0,0,11,0,26,,,0308-597X,1872-9460,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Edinburgh, Grant Inst, Sch Geosci, Kings Bldg,James Hutton Rd, Edinburgh EH9 3FE, Midlothian, ScotlandUniv Glasgow, Inst Biodivers Anim Hlth & Comparat Med, Graham Kerr Bldg, Glasgow G12 8QQ, Lanark, ScotlandUniv Aberdeen, Sch Biol Sci, Zool Bldg,Tillydrone Ave, Aberdeen AB24 2TZ, ScotlandScottish Assoc Marine Sci, Kirk Rd, Oban PA37 1QA, Argyll, ScotlandWageningen Marine Res, POB 57, NL-1780 AB Den Helder, NetherlandsWageningen Univ, Chair Grp Aquat Ecol & Water Qual Management, Droevendaalsesteeg 3a, NL-6708 PD Wageningen, NetherlandsDeep Seas Environm Solut Ltd, Southampton SO40 7AP, Hants, EnglandAlfred Wegener Inst, Helmholtz Ctr Polar & Marine Res, POB 120161, D-27515 Bremerhaven, GermanyCarl von Ossietzky Univ Oldenburg, Helmholtz Inst Funct Marine Biodivers, Ammerlander Heerstr 231, D-23129 Oldenburg, GermanyCefas Lowestoft Lab, Pakefield Rd, Lowestoft NR33 0HT, Suffolk, EnglandOil & Gas UK, INSITE Programme, 3rd Floor,Exchange 2,62 Market St, Aberdeen AB11 5PJ, ScotlandECAP Consultancy Grp, Spean Bridge PH34 4EG, ScotlandSeascape Belgium, Secretariat European Marine Observat & Data Netwo, Wandelaarkaai 7, B-8400 Oostende, Belgium",Deep Seas Environm Solut LtdOil & Gas UKECAP Consultancy GrpSeascape Belgium,,,2018-11-20,WOS:000448099300016,,,,,
J,,,,,,,,,Antony Knights,,Decommissioning - relative effects of alternative management strategies (DREAMS),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Awarded Grant,Jun 30 2020,2020,"Large amounts of hard infrastructure, such as rigs, were installed in the North Sea following the discovery of exploitable oil and gas in the 1970s. Following public outcry about attempts to dispose of the Brent Spar at sea in the 1990s, regulations were introduced that require oil and gas structures in the sea to be removed at the end of their useful lives. Much of the infrastructure in the North Sea is now at the end of its useful life, at least for the purposes for which it was installed, and is to be decommissioned. A large proportion of the cost of this is borne by taxpayers. Other approaches to decommissioning are possible. Elsewhere in the world redundant infrastructure has been left in situ to support wildlife or to limit seabed disturbance, relocated to form artificial reefs, repurposed to sequester CO2, and so on. The presumption of removal has held back consideration of alternative possibilities in the North Sea. At the same time, debate about alternatives is polarised, and there is a tendency to focus on individual cases rather than the whole North Sea (eco)system. The North Sea is a productive sea that, in addition to providing food, supports many industries other than the extraction of oil and gas. A large expansion in the amount of infrastructure being installed for wind generation is underway and planned to continue. Consideration needs to be given to what happens to this at the end of its useful life. Other man-made structures are also in the sea, such as wrecks, which provide havens for some species. The purpose of the DREAMS project is to bring together all available information about the effects of man-made structures on the marine ecosystem, and on the benefits that ecosystem provides for humans. This information will be analysed and combined with ecosystem models, to examine how different possible approaches to decommissioning lead to different outcomes. In particular the project will highlight trade-offs, where action taken to deliver one objective damages our ability to achieve a different objective. The overall aim is to provide comprehensive information to support decisions, representing a shift from individual, narrowly focused studies to a big picture research endeavor, designed to feed into addressing large social challenges and illustrate how marine science can underpin the provision of wide-ranging benefits to society. The research will involve the collection and analysis of large amounts of information concerning the effects of man-made structures in the sea. Results from analyses will be combined with state-of-the-art ecosystem models to examine how different approaches to decommissioning lead to different outcomes, and what those outcomes mean for people.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,NE/T010835/1,,,,,,,,University of Plymouth,,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:15309887,,,,,

In addition, the seawater temperature, the irradiance, and the amount and composition of the sediments were determined. The inner and outer reef arcs were compared. CAUs located on the inner reef shelf were under the influence of terrigenous sediments. On the outer reefs, the sediments were composed primarily of marine biogenic carbonates. The mean carbonate production in shallow reefs of Abrolhos was 579 +/- 98 g m(-2) y(-1). The builder community was dominated by crustose coralline algae, while the non-builder community was dominated by turf. A marine heat wave was detected during the summer of 2013-2014, and the number of consecutive days with a temperature above or below the summer mean was positively correlated with the turf cover increase. The mean carbonate production of the shallow reefs of Abrolhos Bank was greater than the estimated carbonate production measured for artificial structures on several other shallow reefs of the world. The calcimass was higher than the non-calcareous mass, suggesting that the Abrolhos reefs are still in a positive carbonate production balance. Given that marine heat waves produce an increase of turf cover on the shallow reefs of the Abrolhos, a decrease in the cover represented by reef builders and shifting carbonate production are expected in the near future.",,,,,,,,,18,0,0,0,17,0,19,,,1932-6203,,,,,,,,,,,"Inst Pesquisas Jardim Bot Rio de Janeiro, Rio De Janeiro, Rio De Janeiro, BrazilUniv Sao Paulo, Inst Oceanog, Sao Paulo, SP, BrazilMuseu Nacl Rio de Janeiro, Dept Invertebrados, Rio De Janeiro, Rio De Janeiro, BrazilUniv Fed Rio de Janeiro, Dept Biol Marinha, Rio De Janeiro, Rio De Janeiro, BrazilUniv Fed Paraiba, Dept Engn & Meio Ambiente, Rio Tinto, Paraiba, BrazilUniv Fed Sao Paulo, Inst Mar, Sao Paulo, BrazilUniv Fed Espirito Santo, Dept Oceanog, Vitoria, ES, Brazil",Museu Nacl Rio de Janeiro,,,2016-04-27,WOS:000374976200070,27119151,,,,
J,,,,,,,,,,,Unconventional Generators for Wind Applications,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Awarded Grant,Sep 30 2019,2019,"The vast majority of wind turbine electrical generators are three phase, radial flux machines, of either alternating current induction (such as the Double Fed Induction Generator) or permanent magnet synchronous varieties.Whilst these types and topologies of machine are commercially viable for wind, as demonstrated by the growth in the industry, their novelty is deficient. Wind turbine generators have primarily been selected from an existing range to fit the application rather than being designed to suit the application. This PhD project will explore atypical or, for lack of a better word, 'unusual' machine topologies. Homopolar and heteropolar variants of axial and transverse flux machines, both AC and DC, will be explored. These types have been shown to reduce generator active mass to achieve competitive power densities. Generator types and topologies which may have been overlooked or disregarded in past research, possibly when the wind turbine industry was in its infancy, will be revisited and evaluated in a modern wind turbine generator application.The electrical generator design space will be explored for wind turbine applications by comparing these unconventional machine topologies with the common alternatives in terms of power density and quality, volume, cost, manufacturability and energy conversion efficiency. Consideration of materials will also be an important aspect of this research as there is a desire to reduce or remove the use of rare earth permanent magnets due to the required volume, cost, and geo-political and environmental issues.In essence, the application of electrical machines in wind turbine generators will be revisited from the perspective of 'starting from scratch' in order to select the most appropriate generator technology without bias from current commercial choices.In addition to computational studies and analyses, this research may also require experimental studies of physical prototypes.The research has potential benefits for future large-scale wind turbine manufacturers as well as for small-scale wind and other offshore renewables applications as a result of the 'bottom-up' approach to electrical machine design for particular applications.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,2181743,,,,,,,,Durham University,,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:15329498,,,,,

To this end, a laboratory study was carried out comparing the equilibrium scour depth for two structural designs that are differentiated in the geometrical distance of the structure's lowest node to the seabed. Measurements of local scour depths over time have been conducted with echo sounding transducers. An empirical approach is proposed to predict the final scour depths as a function of the node distance to the seabed. Additionally, 3D laser scans have been performed to obtain the digital elevation model of the surrounding sediment bed. Novel methodologies were developed to describe and easily compare the relative volume change of the sediment bed per surface area due to structure-seabed interaction, enabling spatial analyses of highly complex erosion and deposition patterns. The seabed sediment mobility around the structure is found to be highly sensitive to a change in node distance. The decrease of the node distance results in a higher erosion depth of sediment underneath the structure of up to 26%, especially for current-dominated conditions, as well as an increased deposition of sediment downstream of the structure over a distance of up to 6.5 times the footprint length. The results of this study highlight the requirement to consider the interaction of the structure with the surrounding seabed within the design process of offshore structures, to mitigate potential impacts on the marine environment stemming from the extensive sediment displacement and increased sediment mobility.",,,,,,,,,6,0,0,0,2,0,6,,,,2073-4441,,,,,,,,,,"Tech Univ Carolo Wilhelmina Braunschweig, Leichtweiss Inst Hydraul Engn & Water Resources, D-38106 Braunschweig, GermanyLeibniz Univ Hannover, Ludwig Franzius Inst Hydraul Estuarine & Coastal, D-30167 Hannover, Germany",,,,2020-08-10,WOS:000553495500001,,,,,

The concept of Cells of Ecosystem Functioning, based on connectivity, is introduced to define natural units of management and conservation. The definition of Good Environmental Status, as defined in the Marine Strategy Framework Directive, is fully embraced to set the objectives of the project, by adopting a holistic approach that integrates a full set of disciplines, ranging from physics to bio-ecology, economics, engineering and many sub-disciplines.

This would result in the possibility of fatigue cracking in its members. Cracks in these structures usually initiate around welded areas, then grow progressively from the heat-affected zone to base metal through the thickness of the tubular members. Therefore, fatigue life improvement of offshore structures is of great importance. In this paper, structural analysis of an offshore platform is carried out and the critical joint is specified. The welding process is simulated and the residual stresses due to the welding are determined. Experimental residual stress measurement is carried out and is compared with the simulation result. The simulation results show that the heat affected zone (HAZ) is formed in whole thickness of the brace at weld toe location and approximately half thickness of the chord. The fatigue life of the welded tubular X-joints of offshore structure is investigated experimentally. Furthermore, some joints are shot peened and the effect of shot peening on fatigue life of these joints is explored. The results of experiment show that the fatigue life of shot peened tubular joint is about twice of the original tubular joint. Cracks are initiated in all cases at weld toe. Also a crack on chord branch of joints under fatigue test is observed. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Fouling has great economic impacts on shipping and other marine industries and plays an important role in the spread of marine invasive species across the globe. The main strategy to prevent fouling of artificial surfaces is application of antifouling coatings containing varying concentrations and mixtures of biocides. Presently, copper and zinc are popular antifouling biocides, and the latter is gaining in usage due to the known toxic characteristics of copper in the marine environment and consequent regulation and consumer opinion. Nanomaterials, including Cu and ZnO nanoparticles, have been explored as a way to efficiently deliver biocides from coating matrices. Here, we examine the efficacy and biocide release characteristics of several copper- and zinc-based antifouling coatings, including formulations containing traditional micron-sized Cu and ZnO particles and two containing copper and ZnO nanoparticles, respectively. Most of the antifouling coatings tested significantly reduced the abundance and biodiversity of the fouling community in the three study locations across California. Invasive species were suppressed by most coatings at similar levels to natives, suggesting that in general, antifouling coatings do not favor invasive species. We found that zinc-based antifouling coatings were similar and in some cases better performing than copper, despite the generally lower toxicity of zinc to aquatic organisms compared with copper. The performance of zinc-based coatings, moreover, was not directly related to the amount of zinc released into the water or their zinc content. Nano-based coatings did not offer any clear advantages over non-nano coatings, either in the degree of Zn leaching or fouling suppression. Coating matrix properties clearly are an important factor affecting the efficacy and biocide leaching rate of antifouling coatings.",,,,,,,,,35,3,0,0,12,0,39,,,1388-0764,1572-896X,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Marine Sci Inst, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USAUniv Calif Irvine, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Irvine, CA USAUniv Calif Santa Barbara, Bren Sch Environm Sci & Management, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA",,,,2020-06-09,WOS:000536116800004,,,,,

Degradation-based reliability models, based on specialized diffusion processes, will be developed to explicitly account for the influence of randomly-varying environment conditions on critical wind turbine components, condition-monitoring systems, and time- or weather-constrained maintenance scheduling. Subsequently, stochastic optimization models will be developed to minimize operating and maintenance costs over the life cycle of a wind turbine by adaptively scheduling maintenance activities under uncertain conditions. The analytical tools will: (1) determine the optimal timing of inspections, repairs or replacements; (2) prioritize service activities during scheduled outages; (3) determine which spare parts to order and when; and (4) decide how operating and environmental data should be used to assess the current and future health of critical wind turbine components. Specialized Markov decision process (MDP) and partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP) models with mixed (discrete and continuous) state spaces will be developed along with their associated solution techniques. The developed degradation-based reliability models will be validated using real wind turbine operating data, and the long-run average maintenance costs obtained using the optimization models will be compared with those of a computer simulation model. If successful, the results of this research will lead to improvements in the operation and maintenance of wind energy systems that will soon supply a significant portion of electric power in the United States. A large fraction of the cost of producing wind energy is directly attributable to operating and maintenance costs stemming from scheduled and unscheduled maintenance activities. The primary goal of this work is to provide techniques that better manage environmental and wind turbine data to make cost-effective decisions about maintenance activities. Reducing the cost of wind energy will accelerate the design, analysis and installation of new land-based and offshore wind turbines. Increasing the share of electricity generated by wind resources will help stabilize energy prices, mitigate the effects of greenhouse gases and substantially reduce the nation's dependence on foreign natural resources. Furthermore, the development of a viable wind energy market will help stimulate the U.S. economy by creating jobs directly related to wind energy including turbine manufacturing and installation, as well as permanent jobs for wind turbine operators and maintenance workers.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,1266194,,,,,,,,University of Pittsburgh,,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:13575035,,,,,

Structural health monitoring method (SHM) has been used to decline the effect of the damages caused by marine environmental conditions. Global SHM methods are considered as efficient methods which include both economic and safety issues, and use modal characters of the structure. Major parts of offshore structures which are not available for diagnosing change the monitoring process to a big challenge. Different procedures have been used for diagnosing process, where simulating the structure as a finite element (FE) model is the most common one. Comparison between defected structures FE model and the intact model of the structure is the fundamental concept of SHM diagnostic. Mathematical models are used to develop limited measured data for health monitoring. An important step in SHM process includes FE model updating which is applicable using similar algorithms with diagnosing process. Some algorithms, such as neural network, have been used to detect the damage patterns, where their developing complication is their most important challenge. In this study, a new Fuzzy-Krill Herd algorithm is used to perform structural health monitoring process in a fixed jacket platform and compared with common fuzzy-genetic method. For this purpose, an experimental fixed platform model (SPD9 located in Persian Gulf) is prepared to obtain modal parameters using vibration behavior. Structural FE model is built and numerical model updating is performed on the results of the physical model. Moreover, the effects of uncertainty in damages and health monitoring in experimental and numerical models are considered for detecting damages and monitoring the structure. Using a combination of smart algorithms and fuzzy logic, a complicated and efficient system for structural health monitoring process is introduced.

However, there may still be some useful lessons to be learnt from current 'offshore' practice, and there are certainly some awful warnings from the past. Wave energy devices and the marine structures used in oil and gas exploration as well as production share a common environment and both are subject to wave, wind and current loads, which may be evaluated with well-validated, albeit imperfect, tools. Both types of structure can be designed, analysed and fabricated using similar tools and technologies. They fulfil very different missions and are subject to different economic and performance requirements; hence 'offshore' design tools must be used appropriately in wave energy project and system design, and 'offshore' cost data should be adapted for 'wave' applications. This article reviews the similarities and differences between the fields and highlights the differing economic environments; offshore structures are typically a small to moderate component of field development cost, while wave power devices will dominate overall system cost. The typical 'offshore' design process is summarized and issues such as reliability-based design and design of not normally manned structures are addressed. Lessons learned from poor design in the past are discussed to highlight areas where care is needed, and wave energy-specific design areas are reviewed. Opportunities for innovation and optimization in wave energy project and device design are discussed; wave energy projects must ultimately compete on a level playing field with other routes to low CO(2) energy and/or energy efficiency.

These can be used for drilling wells, or for maintenance activities. As rigs are usually scarce compared to the number of wells requiring service, a schedule of wells to be drilled or repaired must be devised. The objective is to minimize opportunity costs within certain operating constraints. This paper present the first stochastic approach to deals with the problem of planning and scheduling a fleet of offshore oil rigs, where the service time is assumed being uncertain. A simulation-optimization method is used to generate expected solutions and performance measures for rigs, as well as statistics about well allocation to rigs. The methodology can be used in two different ways - to schedule an existing fleet of rigs or to scale the size of the fleet - both contemplating the uncertain nature of the problem. The method's expected results include performance measures for each rig, expected delay for a well to be served, the expected schedule of rigs, and a distribution of the well servicing order.

In contrast to the other management tools, ARs require a modification of natural habitats. We used under water visual censuses to investigate the effect of habitat modification on the structure of fish communities by comparing a natural reef (NR) to ARs with different habitat complexity. Different fish assemblage descriptors were used to assess species- and functional- and community-level aspects of the assemblages. ARs were rapidly colonized by adult fishes and presented community compositions different from that of the NR. Fish densities and functional richness were higher in the ARs than in the NR. Small isolated artificial structures, such as culverts and box-culverts, had different fish community compositions than more extended and complex structures, demonstrating the effect of structural habitat complexity on fish assemblages. Fish density was higher in small structures, most likely due to habitat isolation and patchiness. This study indicates that ARs which are located along sandy coastal areas with few rocky habitats and under high river nutrient influence are a suitable habitat for rocky coastal fish communities. Nevertheless, due to higher habitat complexity and lower fishing pressure on ARs, fish communities of an AR functionally differ from those of a NR.

In this article, we propose an improved method of modal parameter estimation by reconstructing a new signal only with interested frequencies. The approach consists of three steps: 1) isolation and reconstruction of interested frequencies using FFT filtering, 2) smoothness of reconstructed signals, and 3) extraction of interested modal parameters in time domain. The theoretical improvement is that the frequency response function (FRF) of filtered signals is smoothed based on singular value decomposition technique. The elimination of false modes is realized by reconstructing a block data matrix of the eigensystem realization algorithm (ERA) using the filtered and smoothed signals. The advantage is that the efficiency of the identification process of modal parameters will be improved greatly without introducing any false modes. A five-DOF mass-spring system is chosen to illustrate the procedure and demonstrate the performance of the proposed scheme. Numerical results indicate that interested frequencies can be isolated successfully using FFT filtering, and unexpected peaks in auto spectral density can be removed effectively. In addition, interested modal parameters, such as frequencies and damping ratios, can be identified properly by reconstructing the Hankel matrix with a small dimension of ERA, even the original signal has measurement noises.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,1672-5182,1993-5021,,,,,,,,,,"Ocean Univ China, Dept Ocean Engn, Qingdao 266100, Peoples R China",,,,2015-12-02,WOS:000364572000005,,,,,

J,,,,,,,,,"Archer, Cristina",,Improved Understanding of Vertical Mixing in the Lower Atmospheric Boundary Layer in the Presence of Wind Turbines via Numerical Simulations and Measurements,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Awarded Grant,Jun 01 2016,2016,"Wind energy has been growing steadily in the U.S. and worldwide in the past decades and it is projected to continue its growth in the near future. Wind energy has countless benefits: it is renewable and abundant, does not produce any harmful pollutant or greenhouse gas emissions, and is so technologically advanced that it is often economically competitive with other traditional energy sources. However, concerns are rising about possible undesirable effects of wind turbines in the lower boundary layer, especially on near-surface temperature. The literature is highly divided about what these effects could be. Numerical simulations have shown: warming during day and night; warming at night and cooling during the day; warming or cooling depending on atmospheric stability; cooling; and no significant effects. These contradictory findings highlight the inherent complexity of the feedbacks between wind turbines and atmosphere. Only one mechanism, however, has been widely accepted (but never tested) to explain how wind turbines affect the lower boundary layer, namely that turbulence generated in wind turbine wakes enhances vertical mixing. Wakes are plume-like volumes downwind of wind turbines that are characterized by lower wind speeds and higher turbulence than the undisturbed upwind flow. Enhanced vertical mixing would manifest as increased vertical momentum fluxes (thus increased wind shear) and increased turbulent kinetic energy (TKE) near the ground. The few observational campaigns that have measured changes in near-surface properties by wind turbines have been flawed or inconclusive and have not measured directly vertical momentum flux changes. Therefore, no direct evidence of the enhanced vertical mixing mechanism is available today. In addition, enhanced vertical mixing does not explain all the observed effects. Intellectual Merit: The research hypothesis put forward in this project is that vertical mixing is generally not enhanced, but, more likely, reduced near the surface downwind of wind turbines. The vertical wind profile is greatly altered due to the extraction of kinetic energy by wind turbines in the region around the rotor disk of diameter D spanned by the turbine blades, but the resulting wind shear near the ground is generally unaltered or reduced, not enhanced, below the rotor. Near-surface heat, moisture, and momentum fluxes, and eventually temperature, are therefore generally not directly affected by wake turbulence, but rather by a combination of the reduced, not enhanced, wind shear, atmospheric stability, and undisturbed flow properties. To test this hypothesis, a combined observational and numerical approach will be carried out. The measurement campaign, named VERTEX for VERTical Enhanced MiXing, will be conducted near the University of Delaware Gamesa 2-MW wind turbine in Lewes, using 12-15 surface flux towers, a 60-m meteorological towers, and 2 scanning lidars. VERTEX will quantify changes in momentum and heat fluxes, air temperature, and TKE near the ground due to the wind turbine. The interactions between the wind turbine and the atmospheric flow will be simulated with at least two state-of-the-art numerical codes that can resolve the details of the turbulent wake down to a few meter resolution. Data from VERTEX will be used to validate the simulations. The sensitivity to a variety of inflow and atmospheric stability conditions will also be assessed. Broader Impacts: This research will provide an understanding if and how wind turbines can alter near-surface properties in any significant way. This understanding is important because it will either enhance wind energy deployment or slow it if such changes are considered too dramatic. Research findings will be communicated to: 1) the scientific community via participation to conferences and peer-reviewed papers; 2) the general public via targeted outreach efforts, including an exhibit at the annual University of Delaware's Coast Day and press releases; and 3) university students via a newly developed graduate and undergraduate course on Energy in the atmosphere.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,1564565,,,,,,,,University of Delaware,,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:13638704,,,,,

In shallow-water areas (< similar to 100 m), fixed bottom caisson designs and artificial islands usually offer the best solutions. In deeper water, however, moored floating systems such as the ship-shaped Floating Production Unit (FPU), the Spar and the Single Column Floater (SCF (TM)) are practical solutions. Even in shallower water where earthquakes are a threat, a moored floater can be a better option because of its ability to avoid seismic effects of the quake due to its suspension in the water above the sea floor.It is estimated that about 30% of the remaining oil and gas reserves lie in the arctic regions of the world. Special care has to be taken to design offshore platforms to survive these extreme arctic environments. Along with severe environmental conditions, there is a possibility of icebergs and multi-year ice sheets as well.A practical solution is to remove the floating structure in case of the expected loads on the structure exceed the maximum design loads. The platform can be brought back to location after the extreme environmental condition has passed.This paper describes a design for a disconnectable mooring system that comprises of external fairleads, submerged chain locker boxes and diverter units along with quick release mechanism and a single handling winch for each group of lines. The system works in tandem with the rig's ROV and an anchor handling tugboat when connecting the system, while disconnection is automatic without any external assistance other than an emergency release signal.

However, these data are frequently lacking, making simple algorithms, which require little data, appealing. Because of their simplicity, these algorithms often rely on implicit assumptions, some of which may be quite restrictive. Potential Biological Removal (PBR) is a simple harvest model that estimates the number of additional mortalities that a population can theoretically sustain without causing population extinction. However, PBR relies on a number of implicit assumptions, particularly around density dependence and population trajectory that limit its applicability in many situations. Among several uses, it has been widely employed in Europe in Environmental Impact Assessments (EIA), to examine the acceptability of potential effects of offshore wind farms on marine bird populations. As a case study, we use PBR to estimate the number of additional mortalities that a population with characteristics typical of a seabird population can theoretically sustain. We incorporated this level of additional mortality within Leslie matrix models to test assumptions within the PBR algorithm about density dependence and current population trajectory. Our analyses suggest that the PBR algorithm identifies levels of mortality which cause population declines for most population trajectories and forms of population regulation. Consequently, we recommend that practitioners do not use PBR in an EIA context for offshore wind energy developments. Rather than using simple algorithms that rely on potentially invalid implicit assumptions, we recommend use of Leslie matrix models for assessing the impact of additional mortality on a population, enabling the user to explicitly define assumptions and test their importance.

This study analyses the feasibility and system performance of parallel tapping line-commutated converter (LCC)-HVDC systems with multiple full-bridge modular multilevel converters under various fault scenarios and operating conditions. Simulation results reveal that undesirable system disturbances such as DC-link voltage sags, DC-link current overshoots, and the transient reduction of inverter extinction angle are imposed on the LCC-HVDC system in the case of tap station AC side faults.

Shipping and ocean sprawl (multiplication of artificial structures at the expense of natural habitats) are considered as the major forces responsible for marine invasions and biotic homogenization. And yet, there is little evidence of their interplay at multiple spatial scales. Here, we aimed to examine this interaction and the extent to which the type of artificial habitat alters the distribution of native and non-indigenous biodiversity. Location Southeast Pacific-Central Chilean coastline. Methods Settlement plates were deployed upon two types of artificial habitats (floating and non-floating hard substrates) at a total of ten study sites, exposed to either international or local traffic. After colonization periods of 3 and 13 months, plates were retrieved to determine their associated fouling sessile assemblages at an early and late stage of development, respectively. Putative confounding factors (temperature, metal concentrations) were taken into account. Results While traffic type had no detectable effect, there were strong differences in community structure between habitats, consistent across the study region. These differences were driven by non-indigenous species which contributed to 58% and 40% of the community structure in floating habitats after 3 and 13 months, respectively-roughly 10 times greater than in their non-floating counterparts. Assemblages on floating structures also displayed a lower decline in similarity with increasing distance between sampling units, being thus more homogenous than non-floating habitats at the regional scale. Main conclusions With the absence of international traffic effect, the colonization success by non-indigenous species appears to be mainly habitat-dependent and driven by local propagules. Floating structures not only provide specific niches but characteristics shared with major introduction and dispersal vectors (notably hulls), and in turn constitute important corridors to invasions and drivers of biotic homogenization at multiple scales.",,,,,,,,,20,0,0,0,18,1,20,,,1366-9516,1472-4642,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Catolica Santisima Concepcion, CIBAS, Fac Ciencias, Dept Ecol, Concepcion, ChileSorbonne Univ, Stn Biol Roscoff, CNRS, UMR 7144 AD2M, Roscoff, FranceUniv Catolica Santisima Concepcion, Fac Ciencias, Dept Quim Ambiental, Concepcion, ChileUniv Catolica Santisima Concepcion, CIBAS, Fac Ingn, Dept Medio Ambiente & Energia, Concepcion, ChileUniv Concepcion, Fac Farm, Dept Anal Instrumental, Concepcion, Chile",,,,2019-10-15,WOS:000489902600001,,,,,

The presence of turbine foundations introduces hard substrates into areas previously dominated by soft sediments, implying that artificial reef effects may occur, with potential benefits for fisheries. This review focuses on the possibilities for locating fisheries for two commercially important decapods, the brown crab Cancer pagurus and the European lobster Homarus gammarus, within offshore wind farms.Existing understanding of habitat use by C pagurus and H. gammarus suggests that turbine foundations have the potential to act as artificial reefs, although the responses of these species to noise and electromagnetic fields are poorly understood. Offshore wind farm monitoring programmes provide very limited information, but do suggest that adult C pagurus associate with turbine foundations, which may also serve as nursery areas. There was insufficient deployment and monitoring of rock armouring to draw conclusions about the association of H. gammarus with offshore wind farm foundations.

Since its diet is mainly based on fish, this raptor is typically encountered close both to marine and fresh waters. Ospreys are well represented in the Arabian Peninsula where remote islands are the location for some of their key breeding sites. On Marawah Island (Emirate of Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates), ospreys have been reported to build nests on top of abandoned man-made structures, including archaeological sites. The discovery of fish remains associated with numerous bird bones and eggshell fragments in archaeological deposits raises the question of the potential contamination of ancient faunal accumulations by birds of prey. To date, the possible impact of ospreys on zooarchaeological assemblages has been little considered and the taphonomic signature of this fish-eating raptor has never been described. However, ospreys are effective competitors to traditional and small-scale fisheries and should be considered as potential accumulators of fish remains on archaeological sites located close to water bodies. Indeed, zooarchaeological analyses demonstrate that fish had always played a major role in the daily subsistence of the ancient inhabitants of Marawah Island since the first traces of occupation dating back some 8000 years. The present study will enable researchers working in the region as well as in other geographical area to determine if ospreys are accumulation agents for fish remains on archaeological sites.The present diet assessment of ospreys allows us to specify the taphonomic signature of this raptor: targeted species are mainly medium to large-sized fish swimming just beneath the surface (e.g. needlefish and queenfish) and slow benthic fish occurring in shallow waters such as tripodfish, emperors, and groupers. Bone accumulations are almost entirely composed of skull elements, indicating specific discarding behaviours. Certain traces left on jaw bones, in particular maxillae, can also help to differentiate osprey accumulations from archaeological ones.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,2352-409X,,,,,,,,,,,"Museum Natl Hist Nat, AASPE, UMR 7209, 55 Rue Buffon, F-75005 Paris, FranceDept Culture & Tourism DCT Abu Dhabi, Hist Environm Dept, POB 94000, Abu Dhabi, U Arab Emirates",Dept Culture & Tourism DCT Abu Dhabi,,,2020-11-24,WOS:000582803200067,,,,,

The partial load and resistance factors within it were calibrated using environmental conditions appropriate to the Gulf of Mexico, USA.One of the advantages of the limit state design approach is that it offers more opportunity for influencing and improving design by adjusting or optimizing the partial safety factors to suit different environmental conditions and design practices.

The platform is located 12 km off the coast of the Brazilian province Rio Grande do Norte, in the north-east of Brazil. The samples were extracted at different orientations and heights above mean sea level. A simple model based on Fick's second law is considered and compared with a finite element model which takes into account transport of chloride ions by diffusion and convection. Results show that convective flows significantly affect the studied chloride penetrations. The convection velocity is obtained by fitting the finite element solution to the experimental data and seems to be directly proportional to the height above mean sea level and also seems to depend on the orientation of the face of the platform. This work shows that considering solely diffusion as transport mechanism does not allow a good prediction of the chloride profiles. Accounting for capillary suction due to moisture gradients permits a better interpretation of the material's behaviour. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Following the trend, Malaysia's fuel consumption has been increasing by an annual rate of 7.2% since 1990 and has even reached 44.9 Mtoe in 2008. It is forecasted to reach 207.3 Mtoe by the year 2030. Due to serious depletion of reserves in various onshore locations, the exploration process is expanded to offshore deeper waters. Seven sedimentary basins belonging to Malaysia, in South China Sea, show great promise to be excellent sources of hydrocarbons. For deep-sea exploration fixed offshore structures are not feasible. An economical alternative is Spar platforms, which are floating structures ideal for exploration of deep water deposits. In this research, Malaysian experience in offshore hydrocarbon exploration is investigated. Various kinds of operational Spar platforms are censoriously explored and their recent technical developments are reviewed. The study reveals that Malaysia's primary energy requirements were met (in year 2008) with natural gas by 43.4% of the total, crude oil by 38.2%, coal by 15.3% and hydropower by 3.1%; indicating evidently that natural gas and crude oil are still the predominant energy sources. Out of the total energy, around 70% oil and 85% natural gas come from offshore fields. These large figures highlight the necessity to consider economically viable alternatives. Spar platform is an innovative marine structure designed to conduct such deep sea explorations. First commissioned Spar at Kikeh field of Malaysia is testimony to immense potential and possibilities of incorporating Spar platforms in the country's deep reserves for sustainable energy generation. Classic Spar, Truss Spar, Cell Spar and Cell-truss Spar are identified to be well suited for these environments. Since the offshore fields are located at waters with more than 1000 m depth, Spar platforms can be successfully installed at these Malaysian deep water fields. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

An experimental measurement from structural behavior under harsh marine environmental conditions is necessary to reduce this uncertainty in practical structural monitoring process of jacket structures. As an alternative, a novel and robust simplified methodology based on the empirical investigation could be a practical approach of better understanding the structures integrity. Hence, these methodologies are often termed as model reduction schemes. In this article, model reduction schemes include simplified platform model and static reduction. This work introduces a structural integrity assessment strategy for jacket structures based on the finite element (FE) model updating and a novel simplified method. Hereof, model reducing and model updating procedure is established based on a novel optimization technique. Since the number of measured degrees of freedom is most of the time restricted in practice, this paper represents a methodology using the cross model cross mode (CMCM) method in combination with an iterative procedure which uses limited, spatially incomplete modal information. One of the important advantages associated with the proposed method is that measuring the rotational degrees of freedoms, which is most of the time very expensive and inaccurate, is not needed.This research is an empirical study on a laboratory model of a jacket structure with the aim of establishing Refined Simplified FE Model (i.e. RSM) to conduct damage detection. The studied jacket structure is a reduced scale 2D frame fabricated and tested at the Laboratory of Modal Analysis of the Tabriz University, Iran. Hereof, experimental vibration tests are accomplished on a physical 2D platform model to record dynamic responses and acquire dynamic features of damaged structure. In addition to eliminate the uncertainty effects in the damage detection results, FtSM technique is employed because of practical considerations and also this technique provides a fast damage zone diagnosis procedure. Also, improved reduction scheme is utilized based on static reduction scheme to carry out damage detection in jacket structure. Improved reduction technique eliminates the bad influence of model reduction procedure on the proposed new methodology. The results demonstrate that the presented new technique is completely successful in conducing damage identification in jacket structures.",,,,,,,,,8,1,0,0,0,0,8,,,0029-8018,,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Tabriz, Civil Engn Dept, Tabriz 5166616471, Iran",,,,2017-11-15,WOS:000414886600013,,,,,

These actions usually govern the platforms' structural design, while seismic action appears to have minor influence. Nonetheless, numerous offshore structures have been founded in earthquake-prone regions where the structural design can be strongly affected by earthquake action. Many studies have investigated the seismic behaviour of oil and gas offshore platforms examining traditional seismic records. This study investigates the application of simple pulses, i.e., exponential, triangular, rectangular and sinusoidal pulse waveforms, as an earthquake excitation for offshore platforms. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first time that the aforementioned set of simplified ground motions have been applied to assess the nonlinear seismic behaviour of offshore oil/gas platform. It should be mentioned that pulses could make important information concerning the dynamic response available considering that many intense seismic events enclose actually an acceleration pulse, which can lead to a nonlinear structural response. It is worth noticing that a small number of works have examined the nonlinear response of the platform and most of the previous works assumed fixed boundary conditions ignoring the soil-structure interaction. On the contrary, this study investigates the structural response of 3-D platforms under the action of simplified pulses, considering also the soil-pile-platform interaction.

They mate and spawn on the reefs, but their larvae drift for several months in the open ocean before metamorphosing into a postlarval stage that moves onshore, seeking shallow, vegetated habitats in which to settle. Following settlement, the postlarvae metamorphose into early benthic-stage juveniles that remain hidden within vegetative cover, sheltered from predators and with a choice of abundant prey.

We also conducted a concurrent 7-mo manipulative experiment on the suspended reef and one of the natural reefs, and monitored fish feeding behaviour on experimental collectors, to examine effects of large mobile consumers on these patterns. In both experiments, taxonomic composition as percent planar cover for the whole community or biomass for the invertebrate component differed between collector topsides, dominated by a filamentous algal matrix, and shaded undersides with a profuse assemblage of suspension- or filter-feeding invertebrates. In the mensurative experiment, we found differences in final community and invertebrate composition between sites, which clustered according to reef type (artificial vs. natural) for collector undersides. Invertebrate biomass was greater at both artificial reefs than at one (undersides) or both (topsides) natural reefs. In the manipulative experiment, we found similar differences in composition between sites/reef types as well as between treatments (exclusion vs. control), and the invertebrate biomass was greater on the artificial reef. Invertebrate biomass was greater in the exclusion treatment than the control on collector undersides, suggesting mobile consumers can affect community composition and abundance.

We found records of 6 artificial reefs in Lake Erie, 8 in Lake Michigan, 3 in Lakes Huron and Ontario, and 2 in Lake Superior. We found 9 reefs in Great Lakes connecting channels and 6 reefs in Great Lakes tributaries. Objectives of artificial reef creation have included reducing impacts of currents and waves, providing safe harbors, improving sport-fishing opportunities, and enhancing/restoring fish spawning habitats. Most reefs in the lakes themselves were incidental (not created purposely for fish habitat) or built to improve local sport fishing, whereas reefs in tributaries and connecting channels were more frequently built to benefit fish spawning. Levels of assessment of reef performance varied; but long-term monitoring was uncommon as was assessment of physical attributes. Artificial reefs were often successful at attracting recreational species and spawning fish; however, population-level benefits of artificial reefs are unclear. Stressors such as sedimentation and bio-fouling can limit the effectiveness of artificial reefs as spawning enhancement tools. Our investigation underscores the need to develop standard protocols for monitoring the biological and physical attributes of artificial structures. Further, long-term monitoring is needed to assess the benefits of artificial reefs to fish populations and inform future artificial reef projects.

Recently, there has been an increase in the frequency of appearance of high wave groups that are observed for long periods due to a rise in the sea level and the emerging abnormal climate. This has caused large-scale morphological change and is the major factor that accelerates beach erosion. This study monitors a target area wherein a sediment transport was observed to actively occur; this was achieved by using a beach stabilization measure. The variations in the beach profile and the ratio of the sandy beach budget were predicted using the results obtained.

The ability to predict the two different modes of post-failure landslide evolution is critical for determining the tsunami hazard and type of landslide impact on offshore structures. The proposed analysis is based on the analogy between ploughing and spreading failures. It uses the energy balance approach to develop the criterion for progressive shear band propagation driven by accumulation of sliding material on top of the stable slope. This criterion is then combined with the kinematic passive block mechanism to produce analytical ploughing failure criteria formulated in terms of the critical rise in the seabed level. If the minimum rise of the seabed level at which ploughing can take place is larger than the maximum possible free-standing step in the seabed surface, the first passive failure block will start crumbling over top the stable zone causing the landslide to runout. Application of the derived criteria to the analysis of observed geomorphological features is demonstrated using an example of a paleolandslide complex in the Caspian Sea.",,,,,,,,,23,3,0,0,0,0,24,,,0008-3674,1208-6010,,,,,,,,,,"ETH, Inst Geotech Engn, CH-8093 Zurich, Switzerland",,,,2016-09-20,WOS:000380912600009,,,,,

The unique architecture of each platform may influence the size and structure of the associated fish assemblage if different structural elements form distinct habitats for fishes. Using scuba survey data from 11 southern California platforms from 1995 to 2000, we examined fish assemblages associated with structural elements of the structure, including the major horizontal crossbeams outside of the jacket, vertical jacket legs, and horizontal crossbeams that span the jacket interior. Patterns of habitat association were examined among three depth zones: shallow (<16.8 m), midwater (16.8-26 m), and deep (>26 m); and between two life stages: youngof-the-year and non-young-of-the-year. Fish densities tended to be greatest along horizontal beams spanning the jacket interior, relative to either horizontal or vertical beams along the jacket exterior, indicating that the position of the habitat within the overall structure is an important characteristic affecting fish habitat use. Fish densities were also higher in transects centered directly over a vertical or horizontal beam relative to transects that did not contain a structural element.

We assess drivers of avian richness and abundance in a long-established seabird community present in a series of longline mussel farms in Italy and in response to a recent modernization process in the farming methodology. Over 2 years (24 surveys) we detected a remarkable diversity (15 species in 5 families) and abundance (n= 5858) of birds, of which 40% (n= 6) are regarded as species of international conservation importance. Our models highlighted that the strongest driver explaining variation in abundance and richness across sites was the type of buoy and the associated cultivation method applied. The older and fast-declining double headrope design, offered greater stability for birds to rest. Conversely, the newer and mechanizable single headrope design dominant method in our study site and projected to replace the older system, was unsuitable for birds. Our findings confirm the function of mussel farms as a sort of marine protected area where low anthropogenic disturbance, higher prey availability and suitable artificial structures promote the establishment of seabird communities with minimal impacts on harvest.

Previous studies found that variation in colonisation of space at mid-shore levels could account for differences in mature assemblages between seawalls and vertical surfaces on adjacent rocky shores in Sydney Harbour (Australia). This study tests the model that the nature of the substratum is responsible for different patterns of early colonisation between vertical ledges of rocky shores and seawalls. According to this model, patterns in early colonisation would differ between cleared areas created on vertical surfaces on rocky shores and seawalls, but not between standard surfaces (panels) installed on each structure. Early colonisation of space differed between seawalls and rocky shores, regardless of the type of substratum (clearings versus panels). Differences in relative abundances between structures were evident on both types of substrata for some taxa, while they varied between substrata for others. No taxa, however, showed consistent differences between structures in only the clearings. In addition, the abundance of some taxa differed between panels on the different structures, suggesting that the effects of the substratum were modulated by factors operating differentially between rocky shores and seawalls.

These procedures are usually performed by mobile drilling rigs with no storage capacity, and thus, hydrocarbons sequestered must be burned off from the rig flare booms. Another major problem has been the inability of the flare to operate at high flow rates. Because the burning process slows the pace of a test, restricting full flow testing, valuable well information is lost. Flaring of hydrocarbons also represents an economic loss. In the case of oil rigs, for example, flaring not only emits CO2 into the atmosphere but also burns off usable oil.The Crystal Sea well-test vessel was designed to address the problems inherent to flaring and, at the same time, provide cost efficiency by salvaging usable oil during well testing. The success of her initial two jobs on the Statfjord North satellite field in the Norwegian sector of the North Sea confirms that sale of the salvaged oil normally lost during the flaring process could generate sufficient economic return to pay for the vessel.

In recent years, their natural environment is being intensively altered by the construction of offshore wind farms in many coastal areas. These constructions form artificial reefs influencing local biodiversity and ecosystem functioning. It has been demonstrated that Atlantic cod is present in the vicinity of these constructions. However, empirical data concerning the diel activity and feeding behaviour of Atlantic cod in the vicinity of these artificial reefs is lacking. Atlantic cod has a flexible diel activity cycle linked to spatio-temporal variations in food availability and predation risk. In this study we integrated acoustic telemetry with stomach content analysis to quantify diel activity and evaluate diel feeding patterns at a windmill artificial reef (WAR) in the Belgian part of the North Sea. Atlantic cod exhibited crepuscular movements related to feeding activity; a 12 h cycle was found and the highest catch rates and stomach fullness were recorded close to sunset and sunrise. It is suggested that the observed diel movement pattern is related to the prey species community and to predation pressure. Foraging at low ambient light levels (i.e. at dusk and dawn) probably causes a trade-off between foraging success and reducing predation pressure. Fish did not leave the area in-between feeding periods. Hence other benefits (i.e. shelter against currents and predators) besides food availability stimulate the aggregation behaviour at the WARS.

The survey determines the populations understanding of nature, how nature is perceived and experienced, what willingness there is to engage in nature conservation and how current issues of nature conservation policy are assessed. In 2019, SINUS Markt- und Sozialforschung GmbH was responsible for conducting the face-to-face study. Topics: 1. Protected areas: Associations with the topic of protected areas (open); familiarity with various terms (Natura 2000, national park, nature reserve, biosphere reserve/area, nature park, landscape conservation area, FFH areas, bird sanctuary, national natural landscapes, national natural heritage, water conservation areas, marine conservation areas); frequency of specifically seeking out the following categories of protected areas: Natura 2000, national park, nature reserve, biosphere reserve and nature park; visiting these protected areas in the immediate vicinity of the place of residence, as an excursion in the region, on holiday in Germany, on holiday outside Germany; most important goals and tasks of protected areas (3 mentions from a selection of keywords); information interest: particularly interesting information about protected areas (3 mentions); preferences for receiving information about the topic of protected areas (3 mentions); attribution of responsibility: Actors who should bear more responsibility in Germany for ensuring that protected areas can fulfil their tasks (federal government, federal states, municipalities, environmental and nature conservation organisations, citizens, churches and religious communities, agriculture, forestry, tourism, and industry, trade, other business); agreement with the following statements on protected areas (protected areas make a significant economic contribution to a region, I think it is good that there are areas where nature conservation is particularly important, there are already enough protected areas in Germany, protected areas are an important part of my homeland, Germany should do more politically to maintain and expand international protected area networks, protected areas are important to preserve nature for future generations, in the future protected areas will be more important for the conservation of species than they have been up to now, protected areas make a significant contribution to the identity of a region, protected areas leave people out because of too many bans). 2. Knowledge of species: basic assessment of own knowledge of species (I know the local flora well, I know the local fauna well, I would like to know more animal and plant species by name); interest in knowledge of species ( mention of 3 groups of species); places of learning where more knowledge about biodiversity should be taught (3 mentions). 3. Human-nature relationship: associations with the term nature (open mentions); attitude towards nature and nature conservation in general (it makes me happy to be in nature, I dont feel good in nature, I am annoyed by the careless way many people treat nature, nature conservation as a duty of man, nature must not stand in the way of economic development, we must only use nature in such a way that this is also possible to the same extent for future generations, in times of economic crisis nature conservation must also manage with less money, the wilder nature, the better I like it, nature conservation is necessary to meet the challenges of climate change). 4. Genetic engineering: attitude towards genetic engineering (trust in scientists when they confirm the safety of the new genetic engineering methods, long-term consequences of the new genetic engineering methods are not yet foreseeable, animals and plants from the wild should not be deliberately genetically modified, possible effects on nature should always be investigated when plants are genetically modified with the new methods); importance of banning the use of genetically modified organisms in agriculture; opinion on the issue of genetic engineering in agriculture (demand for labelling of food from animals fed with genetically modified food, have no problem eating genetically modified food, genetic engineering in agriculture is an important component in the fight against world hunger). 5. Energy transition: Advocacy of the energy transiition; assessment of the changes to the landscape in the course of the energy transiition due to the possible increase in wind turbines on land, out at sea and on the North Sea and Baltic Sea coasts, logging in forests, areas under maize cultivation, areas under rape cultivation, the number of high-voltage power lines, the number of lines laid as underground cables, the number of biogas plants, solar plants on meadows and fields, and solar plants on and on buildings; attitude towards the energy transition (the energy transition in Germany is a real community project, the energy transition distinguishes us in Germany from other countries, necessary to counter climate change, necessary to make Germany less dependent on importing energy and energy sources from other countries). 6. Biological diversity: awareness of the term biological diversity; personal meaning of the term biological diversity; convinced that biological diversity on earth is decreasing; preservation of biological diversity as a priority social task; willingness to do various things to protect biological diversity (change the brand of cosmetics or drugstore articles if their production endangers biological diversity, donate to the care and preservation of a protected area, actively participate in a nature conservation association, use a guidebook when shopping, e.g. informing about endangered fish species, making friends and acquaintances aware of biodiversity protection, informing about current developments in the field of biodiversity); attitude towards biodiversity (scale: personally perceived responsibility for the conservation of biological diversity, demand for a reduction in the use of land for settlements, industry and transport routes, promotes my well-being and quality of life, financial support for the efforts of poorer countries to conserve biological diversity by richer countries, personally perceived impairment by declining biological diversity, climate change threatens biological diversity). 7. Digitalisation: opinion on opportunities and risks of digitalisation in general; rather more opportunities vs. more risks of digitalisation for nature conservation; nature conservation should try to use the opportunities of digitalisation more for itself; use of an app is conceivable that informs about nature threats, successes of nature conservation or personal possibilities of action for nature. 8. Behavioural measure donation scale: Willingness to donate to nature conservation measures in a protected area in Germany in the event of winning 100 euros; decision on the donation amount and the concrete use of the donation (species and habitat protection directly on site, internet information to reach more people and nature experience and recreation for people); voluntary arbitrary division of the donation between the three measures mentioned.

In the study, all reported hydrocarbon leaks from process inventories on all offshore installations on the NCS, with an initial leak rate higher than 0.1 kg/s in the period 2008-2014, have been considered. This includes 78 hydrocarbon leaks, of which about 60% have occurred during manual intervention on normally pressurized systems. The dominating activity when leaks occur is preventive maintenance. A significant fraction of the leaks occur during the preparation for maintenance; such a preparation is typically carried out during the night shift. About half of the leaks are associated with wellhead area and manifolds, separation and compression systems. A substantial fraction of the leaks can be associated with verification faults, dominated by the failure to comply with procedural requirements that are needed to carry out independent verification.

The results demonstrate that over the 18-year period, fluctuating lake levels are associated with shifts in shoreline position and the development of various aggradational and degradational states at the beach. A sustained vapid vise in lake levels will initiate an erosional sequence which will persist even with declining water levels. With a persistent decline in water levels the beach and shoreline will adjust very gradually from unstable, erosional states to an aggradational state. Other results emphasize that those beach sectors directly governed by artificial structures suffered disproportionately higher erosion during high-water levels.

Natural salt marsh formation and natural range expansion outside artificial structures were rare. In the last three decades of this century natural marshes along the southern Wadden Sea coast of Schleswig-Holstein, Germany, started to grow outside groyne fields and extended on tidal mudflats. This growth happened without direct human influence and naturally structured marshes of considerable spatial dimension evolved.Due to a spread in recent decades, natural grown marshes in our study area - southern Schleswig-Holstein Wadden Sea coast - are younger than man-made marshes. Vegetation developed rapidly in response to fine-scaled geomorphological conditions. Meandering creeks and different surface elevation ranges of the developing natural salt marsh are special features. The naturally grown marshes show a high proportion of pioneer vegetation with Sparrina anglica and Salicornia europaea. Succession proceeds fast and elevated parts of the marsh were rapidly colonised with marsh vegetation of Puccinellia maritima and Aster tripoliwn in the lower marsh to late successional stages, like Halindone portulacoides and Elymus athericus, on the higher elevated parts.

To evaluate this model, we contrasted use of natural (kelp forest and turfing algae) and artificial habitat (plastic pier-piling) by a nest-building amphipod (Cymadusa pemptos) under current and future climate conditions of CO2 and temperature. Under future conditions, amphipod populations in mesocosms increased, but this did not lead to greater proportional colonization of kelp and turf. Instead, colonization doubled in artificial habitats, and there was increasing production and occupation of nests on artificial habitats relative to natural habitats. In an age when human modification of natural substrata is increasingly cited as an agent of wildlife decline, understanding the future role of artificial habitats as replacement dwellings for natural habitats is critical.

Compared with the previous version of Norsok Standard N-003 [Norsok Standard. Actions and action effects, N-003. Oslo: Norwegian Technology Standards Institution; 19991, the inertia coefficients adopted by the latest Norsok Standard I Norsok Standard. Actions and action effects, N-003. Oslo: Norwegian Technology Standards Institution: 20071 released in 2007 are significantly decreased while the drag coefficients are slightly increased. The current paper shows that, for fixed offshore structures such as jackets, this change may result in a significantly increased calculated fatigue life. This may indicate that offshore jacket structures currently in service may be allowed a significant life time extension with regard to fatigue. In addition the influence, of the bottom support conditions of the jacket structure on the fatigue life is also investigated. The investigation indicates that, in cases where the pile-soil and conductor soil stiffness data are not available and the structure is high enough, for a rough estimation of the fatigue life on the upper part of a jacket, the jacket's bottom support condition may be simply modelled as fully fixed. By comparing the fatigue life from dynamic analysis with that from static analysis without taking the inertia effects of the structure, equipment mass and other non-structural installations into account, it also shows the significance of the contribution from the structure's dynamic response. The nonlinear dynamic analysis method presented in the current paper has been Successfully applied in several industry projects for the life time extension of offshore installations subject to wave and wind loads.

The proximate composition (carbohydrates, proteins and lipids) differed significantly between liver and muscle tissue but not between fish species or between their potential prey species. Atlantic cod showed to consume more energy than pouting. The latter had a higher overall energy reserve and can theoretically survive twice as long on the available energy than cod. In autumn, both fish species could survive longer on their energy than in spring. Polyunsaturated fatty acids were found in high concentrations in fish liver. The prey species Jassa and Pisidia were both rich in EPA while Jassa had a higher DHA content than Pisidia.Energy profiling supported the statement that wind farm artificial reefs are suitable feeding ground for both fish species.

The control points in the study area were divided into 8 sections, each spaced 50 m pitch apart, for the trend analysis of the beach profiles. Also, the sea zone with 1.35 km(2) area was divided into 6 sections with 300 m x 750 m per section, for the monitoring of water depth variation. The surveying results show that the area of the northern side of the Wolchun beach near the LNG storage base was continuously increased due to the accumulation of sediment after the construction of LNG base. On the contrary, the continuous erosion occurred on the south side of Wolchun beach, and it was observed that the water depth near the surf zone is deepened. Also, the bathymetric change of the test area was occurred actively, and the significantly unstable change of water depth in the region of about -10 m similar to -15 m was confirmed to be generated by the breakwater with the disrupting of operable wave condition.

This study is aimed at analysing legal restrictions on the installation of OWFs in Galician waters and at identifying those zones of less conflict where the wind power density (WPD) is greater and the depths and distances from the coast are technically feasible given the current status of technology in Europe. To do this, a legal study was performed of both the strategic environmental assessment of the Spanish coast and the regulations of the different marine sectors at European, international, national, and regional levels. In addition, the WPD along the north-western area of the Iberian Peninsula and Europe was calculated, and an analysis of maximum and average depths and distances from the coast of planned and installed OWFs in Europe was made.

With increasing concern about the ecological value of built environments, efforts are being made to create novel habitat to increase biodiversity. Rock pools are infrequent on artificial structures. We compared biodiversity patterns between rock pools and emergent rock and assessed the role of pool depth and substratum incline in determining patterns of biodiversity. Rock pools were more taxon rich than emergent substrata. Patterns varied with depth and incline with algal groups being more positively associated with shallow than deeper habitats. Substratum incline had little influence on colonising epibiota, with the exception of canopy algae in deeper habitats where vertical surfaces supported greater taxon richness than horizontal surfaces. The creation of artificial rock pools in built environments will have a positive effect on biodiversity. Building pools of varying depths and inclines and shore heights will provide a range of habitats, increase environmental heterogeneity, therefore creating more possible ecological niches, promoting local biodiversity.

Although dams were shown to negatively affect river habitats, fragmentation by bridges has received less attention and is not as well understood. We tested whether and how bridges present barriers to aquatic insects by studying mass swarmings of Palingenia longicauda mayflies on river Tisza (NE-Hungary). Behavioural observations showed that upon approaching the bridge, upstream-flying mayflies typically turned back and 86% of them never crossed the bridge. Lack of physical contact showed that the bridge was an optical, rather than a mechanical barrier for the polarotactic mayflies. Imaging polarimetry showed that the bridge disrupted the horizontally polarizing channel guiding the flight of mayflies above the river. Energy loss, demonstrated by calorimetry, and time constraints forced females to lay eggs only downstream from the bridge. Counts of larval skins shed by swarming individuals showed nearly 2 to 1 female per male downstream from the bridge, while sex ratio above the bridge was slightly male-biased. We suggest that the surplus of parthenogenetic females, that produce only female larvae, downstream from the bridge may have led to the observed sex-ratio bias since the construction of the bridge (1942). Our results demonstrate that bridges can be optical barriers for aquatic insects and can cause population-level impacts, such as biased sex ratios, in natural populations. Sex ratio biases due to bridges may decrease effective population size and genetic variability, which may have contributed to the recent extinction of this species from most of Europe.",,,,,,,,,25,0,0,0,23,0,26,,,1366-638X,1572-9753,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Debrecen, Dept Ecol, H-4032 Debrecen, HungaryUniv Debrecen, Dept Hydrobiol, H-4032 Debrecen, HungaryUniv Girona, Comp Vis & Robot Grp, Girona 17071, SpainEotvos Lorand Univ, Grp Methodol Biol Teaching, Inst Biol, H-1117 Budapest, HungaryEotvos Lorand Univ, Environm Opt Lab, Dept Biol Phys, H-1117 Budapest, Hungary",,,,2011-11-30,WOS:000296881600007,,,,,

Biofouling on offshore wave energy devices is an issue of concern for the operation or survival of the components. On the other side, these structures may provide habitats for marine organisms and thus increase biodiversity and form artificial reefs. In this chapter, size distribution and biomass of blue mussels on sheltered and exposed marking buoys are examined. Further, these results are used for calculating a worst case scenario of mussel growth on the lifting force of a specially designed toroidal buoy. The results show that more wave-exposed buoys were particularly favourable for blue mussel colonization, but that the hydrodynamic forces of the toroidal buoy were not affected by mussel growth. Thus, biofouling is not necessarily negative for the wave energy absorbance of the wave power buoys.",,,,,,,,,3,0,0,0,1,0,4,,,,,978-1-60876-501-0,,,,,,,,,"Evolutionary Biol Ctr, Dept Anim Ecol, Uppsala, SwedenUppsala Univ, Dept Engn Sci, Swedish Ctr Renewable Elect Energy Convers, Uppsala, Sweden",Evolutionary Biol Ctr,,,2010-01-01,WOS:000276106700012,,,,,

The consequence is a habitat seascape complex, comprising a mosaic of natural and engineered coastal features. This study used the freely available mapping tool (Google Earth) to define the extent of coastal engineering structures in the Great Barrier Reef World Heritage Area (GBR; Australia), a marine ecosystem of global biodiversity and cultural significance. Continuing threats to the heritage estate concomitant with expanding urban and industrial developments has raised concerns directed at the future conservation and resilience of the reef ecosystems, along with maintaining expected human lifestyles and livelihoods it provides. The data here shows that break walls and pontoons/jetties dominate development, contributing to approximately 10% (equivalent) of the coastline linear length. Most (60%) development occurs along the coastline or within the first few kilometres upstream along estuaries. While conservation and protection of natural coastal habitats is still preferred for the objective of fisheries production and biodiversity, managers must consider seascape implication/benefits more broadly when approving new marine infrastructure rather than a case-by-case approach which further contributes to an ad hoc mosaic seascape of natural and engineered habitats. Not only within the GBR heritage estate, but more broadly, coastal managers need to regard wider seascape connectivity processes during the assessment of any new development. There is an urgent need for policy and planning instrument reform that is inclusive of accumulative impacts of urban and industrial development in this heritage estate. Opportunities to include eco-friendly (green engineering) solutions, in the repair and revitalisation of existing artificial structures, is necessary in any new proposed urban and industrial development and expansion.

The development of floating wind farms requires an evaluation of the Maritime Safety Audit Scheme under the Maritime Safety Act in Korea. Floating wind farms shall be assessed by applying the line and area concept for systematic development, management and utilization of specified sea water. The development of appropriate evaluation methods and standards is also required. In this study, proper standards for marine traffic surveys and assessments were established and a systemic treatment was studied for assessing marine spatial area. First, a marine traffic data collector using AIS or radar was designed to conduct marine traffic surveys. In addition, assessment methods were proposed such as historical tracks, traffic density and marine traffic pattern analysis applying the line and area concept. Marine traffic density can be evaluated by spatial and temporal means, with an adjusted grid-cell scale. Marine traffic pattern analysis was proposed for assessing ship movement patterns for transit or work in sea areas. Finally, conceptual design of a Marine Traffic and Safety Assessment Solution (MaTSAS) was competed that can be analyzed automatically to collect and assess the marine traffic data.

In aquatic environments, a popular approach toward habitat enhancement is the introduction of underwater human-made structures or artificial reefs. Despite the nearly global prevalence of artificial reefs deployed to enhance habitat, it remains debated whether these structures function similarly to comparable natural reefs. To help resolve this question, we conducted a literature review and accompanying meta-analysis of fish community metrics on artificial reefs within the coastal ocean and made comparisons with naturally-occurring reference reefs (rocky reefs and coral reefs). Our findings from a synthesis of 39 relevant studies revealed that, across reef ecosystems, artificial reefs support comparable levels of fish density, biomass, species richness, and diversity to natural reefs. Additional analyses demonstrated that nuances in these patterns were associated with the geographic setting (ocean basin, latitude zone) and artificial reef material. These findings suggest that, while artificial reefs can mimic natural reefs in terms of the fish assemblages they support, artificial reefs are not one-size-fits-all tools for habitat enhancement. Instead, artificial reefs should be considered strategically based on location-specific scientific assessments and resource needs to maximize benefits of habitat enhancement.",,,,,,,,,53,1,0,0,37,0,56,,,,2296-7745,,,,,,,,,,"CSS Inc, Fairfax, VA 22030 USANOAA, Natl Ctr Coastal Ocean Sci, Natl Ocean Serv, Beaufort, NC 28516 USANOAA, Southeast Fisheries Sci Ctr, Natl Marine Fisheries Serv, Beaufort, NC USA",,,,2020-05-07,WOS:000530805700001,,,,,

Previous work in Sydney Harbour has shown that common species live on seawalls and rocky shores, but vary in their relative abundances according to height on the shore and location. The potential value of seawalls to provide viable intertidal habitat will depend on their ability to support the full diversity of intertidal species, including those that are relatively rare. This study examines the diversity of animals and plants at 2 heights on rocky shore and seawalls, at 4 locations in Sydney Harbour, using presence/absence measures in an intensive sampling schedule in each habitat. The total number and types of taxa found were very variable within and among locations, but clear patterns arose when the data were combined (800 quadrats in each habitat). With few exceptions, algae and sessile animals were similarly distributed across habitats, but approximately 50% of the mobile animals were not found on seawalls. In addition, rocky shores had a greater proportion of rare taxa (only found in 1 or very few quadrats). Of the shared taxa, patterns of occurrence were similar on the 2 structures.

Much of the infrastructure relating to the oil and gas industry has been in place for decades and is coming to the end of its economic life. In contrast, the marine renewable energy industry is expanding with many windfarms planned for construction in the near future. Current legislation requires that MMS in the North Sea should be removed from the marine environment after their operational lifespan is complete. With the decline of the oil and gas sector, the UK decommissioning operation will cost around £50 billion, with almost half of the financial burden falling on the taxpayer. These forthcoming changes in the North Sea landscape may have a significant impact on marine life. There is mounting evidence that the effects of MMS on the local marine environment are complex, and depend on the age, type, and operational status of the MMS. Once installed, MMS can host artificial reefs supporting diverse communities of marine life. Further, the exclusion of shipping and fishing in the vicinity of many MMS may provide refuges for fish and predators such as sharks, seals or porpoises (de facto Marine Protected Areas). However, the true extent of the effects of MMS on the ecosystem are unclear. To ensure effective decision-making about removal and installation of such structures in the future, there is an urgent need to better understand the impact of MMS on the North Sea ecosystem.EcoSTAR (Ecosystem-level importance of STructures as Artificial Reefs) is a collaborative project combining the expertise of marine ecologists from the Sea Mammal Research Unit (SMRU) at the University of St Andrews and the Centre for Environment, Fisheries and Aquaculture Science (Cefas). EcoSTAR aims to fill in the key knowledge gaps on the impact of MMS across the entire marine ecosystem. This ecosystem-wide approach is critical to fully understand the breadth of possible interactions between MMS and marine species. To achieve this, EcoSTAR will measure impacts of MMS from the bottom of the food chain (the benthic community) all the way to the top (marine mammals). EcoSTAR will 1) improve our understanding of the importance of MMS as habitat for benthic communities such as mussels, anemones and starfish; 2) measure how MMS influence the distribution and movement patterns of marine mammals in the North Sea; 3) determine how many seals and porpoises forage at MMS, and how often, and estimate the associated benefits or costs of MMS to individual animals; and 4) estimate the consumption of fish by seals and porpoises feeding around MMS. Critically, the knowledge gained from this project will be combined with existing data and knowledge of fish, food webs and fisheries, to predict the impacts of MMS on the whole ecosystem using cutting-edge ecosystem models. This will allow the prediction of the impacts of removing old structures (such as oil and gas platforms) and installing new structures (including wind turbines) on the marine ecosystem and on commercial fisheries The findings of EcoSTAR will facilitate the development of environmentally sustainable management strategies for the North Sea as whole, and specifically with regard the addition and removal of MMS.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,NE/T010614/1,,,,,,,,University of St Andrews,,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:15405249,,,,,

The fishing sector, in the Alboran Sea, is economically and culturally one of the most important and relies on overexploited target species such as European hake (Merlucius merlucius). Here we identified and quantified the impact of human pressures on the capacity of marine habitats to support the provision of food as an important ecosystem service. We modelled the spatial distribution of nursery areas of European hake in the Alboran Sea, using General Additive Models (GAM) and overlaid those with European Nature Information System (EUNIS) habitats. A sensitivity analysis of hake nursery areas to cumulative human impacts identified the Bay of Malaga as the most sensitive area with trawling frequencies up to 60 times higher than the habitats recovery time. Further, we identified an increased conflict potential among human activities such as trawling and extraction with the presence of Marine Protected Areas (MPAs), which provide MPAs a high vulnerability similar to that found in unprotected areas. Future scenarios considering the increase of renewable energy and alternative food production show conflicts between aquaculture and MPAs as well as offshore wind farms and offshore shipping. Hence, our results show strong arguments for an integrated spatial management approach, including benthic trawling. We also suggest restricting trawling activities inside MPAs to safeguard the habitats capacity to support ecosystem services. Our spatially explicit assessment framework is transparent and transferable to other Mediterranean regions. Thus, it can function as a model on how to incorporate cumulative effect assessments in marine spatial planning processes.",,,,,,,,,7,0,0,0,3,0,7,,,0141-1136,1879-0291,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Malaga, Andalucia Tech, Dept Ecol & Geol, Campus Teatinos S-N, E-29071 Malaga, SpainCtr Oceanog Malaga, Inst Espanol Oceanog, Puerto Pesquero S-N, Malaga 29640, SpainUniv Hamburg, Inst Marine Ecosyst & Fishery Sci, Olbersweg 24, D-22767 Hamburg, GermanyInst Espanol Oceanog, Sede Cent Madrid, Calle Corazon Maria 8, Madrid 28002, SpainThunen Inst Sea Fisheries, Herwigstr 31, D-27572 Bremerhaven, Germany",,,,2018-12-28,WOS:000452943500021,30361105,,,,

Pre-determined jack-up vessel campaigns appear to have a high cost reduction potential but also a higher stochastic variability than the other decision problems.

The soil profile and depth of each layer of soil is not the same for every place. Therefore, consideration of soil profile and the depth of each layer is important in structural design, especially for offshore structures. In this article, the lateral deflection of piles constructed in a multilayer soil medium is assessed. The evaluation was performed on the Terengganu seaside platform located approximately 350 km away from the Sumatran seismic zones, the Sumatran subducfion and fault zones. To model an earthquake, a recently developed attenuation equation was used, and the effect of the shear wave velocity was investigated, considering the soil profile. The results showed that the effect of the wave reduced as it moved further from the epicentre of the earthquake. The piles experienced complete failure when the magnitude of the earthquake was 8.0, with some loss of pile capacity for a magnitude of 7.5 and below. Considering the effect of shear wave velocity (Vs) of the multilayered strata, and using the new attenuation equation, accurate pile deflections, which were in excellent agreement with previously used methods, were obtained.",,,,,,,,,9,1,0,0,0,0,10,,,0263-2241,1873-412X,,,,,,,,,,"Kermanshah Univ Technol, Dept Civil Engn, Kermanshah, IranUniv Teknol Malaysia, Fac Civil Engn, Trop Geoengn Ctr, Johor Baharu, MalaysiaShiraz Univ, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Shiraz, IranUniv Teknol Malaysia, Fac Civil Engn, Johor Baharu, Malaysia",,,,2018-06-05,WOS:000432748600022,,,,,

Given the complexity of the marine environment, a method capable of accommodating spatio-temporal behaviour of specific species and their interrelation with other marine phenomena is an essential prerequisite for investigating whether or not there has been any measurable impact to date.This paper presents a method based on geostatistical simulation to assess whether pre- and post-construction collected bird count data suggest displacement of birds due to the wind farm. The method takes into account spatial autocorrelation in species abundance at various scales, pre- and post-construction differences in environmental conditions and in survey effort and design.We demonstrate that taking these factors into account influences the conclusions about a wind farm's impact on bird life. In particular, incorporating spatial autocorrelation in seabird numbers is an important factor in reducing the risk of wrongly identifying an effect of a wind farm on bird abundance.Synthesis and applications. The development of offshore wind farms is often in conflict with nature conservation interests. Environmental impact assessment and monitoring is essential to protect and manage the marine environment. The method described here will allow scarce data to be utilized effectively as a basis for well-informed environmental decisions.

At each site we placed pitfall traps across the littoral zone, with replicates at an opposite tidal period. Traps were kept active for 24 hours and emptied every three hours. The beach-hopper Platorchestia smithi was dominant in abundance at both sites; however Portuguese had a higher species number, including the burrowing isopod Actaecia bipleura. Circular summaries and behavioural models were calculated for abundant species. Wefound two different activity peaks for adults (nocturnal) and juveniles (sunrise) of P. smithi, consistent across sites, and a complex, tide-related pattern for A. bipleura. We also remarked the relevance of wrack presence on the littoral: this factor was found to modulate the activities of specific categories of macrofauna, such as females and juveniles of P. smithi, and A. bipleura.

This device costs much less than special side-imaging sonar devices used for research work; moreover, it is capable of scanning just under the boat, referred to as down-scan imaging. The sonar images clearly showed the shape of the deposited debris, and the clarity of the images indicated the density (hardness) of the objects. When the objects were observed using an underwater camera, objective features such as branches and leaves of trees, artificial structures and fishing nets coincided with the estimation by the sonar. The down-scan image was used to determine the height of the debris, and the side-scan image was used to determine the horizontal distribution of the debris. Submarine debris was detected at 78 sites in the small bay having a width of 200m and length of 1 km. We concluded that debris at 21 of these sites should have been removed.

This can be attributed to the continual depletion of reserves in mature fields, and recent discoveries of large quantities of oil and gas in the cold climate region, including the more recent discovery of the Alta Reservoir, in the Barents Sea. However, marine operations in this region are faced with challenges resulting from its arctic conditions.Knowledge of the physical environment is important in designing offshore structures, and in planning, and executing marine operations. Selection of a suitable field development concept may be influenced by the probability of occurrence of rare events, such as drifting icebergs. Furthermore, occurrence of mesoscale phenomenon such as polar low pressures may adversely affect planned marine operations. In addition, uncertainties in weather forecasting will reflect on the available weather window to perform installation and interventions works.This paper presents some of the challenges in designing and planning for marine operations in the cold climate region. A possible field development concept for the open water areas of the Norwegian sector of the Barents Sea is discussed. The current research work considers the need for further assessment of the probability of occurrence of drifting icebergs as of importance when selecting field development concept. The Floating Production Storage and Offloading (FPSO) is proposed, and this should be designed with an internal turret system that can be disconnected and reconnected. Some of the challenges associated with riser systems design when considering a turret system with the capability to disconnect and reconnect are discussed.This paper also propose the use of ensemble forecasts as an alternative to the use of alpha factors to estimate operational weather window when planning for marine operations in the Barents Sea.

By harnessing the power of Machine Learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence (AI), Sift AML transforms the mountains of data produced by wind farms to actionable knowledge that helps to increase their operating efficiency, reliability and maintenance. By doing so, they operate at a higher capacity for longer, saving us all money on our electricity bills.Wind farms create vast quantities of data. A modern offshore wind farm may comprise a hundred or more wind turbines. Each turbine produces hundreds of data signals that contain crucial information about the state of each sub-system and the condition of the thousands of individual components. There are also several support systems that also produce data, such as substations, array cables, service vessels and meteorological masts.In total, a modern offshore wind farm may generate in the order of 10 petabytes of 1Hz data and 15TB of 10-minute statistics annually. Hidden within these data is critical information about component wear and pending failures. When utilised correctly, these data can be transformed into knowledge that can help owners to improve efficiency and reliability, optimise maintenance regimes and reduce operating costs.Most wind farms are connected to central data warehousing systems with web portals where the owners and operators can analyse the information for monitoring purposes. Generally, however, the capabilities of these systems to provide in-depth technical analysis and prognostics are very limited.Sift AML is a simple to deploy, in-depth analytics and prognostics system that enables energy producers of any size to build advanced analytics on top of their existing data warehousing solutions.

Because of their lightness and relatively low installation cost, VLAs offer an attractive alternative for mooring systems. However, existing design procedures are largely empirically based, and uncertainties with regard to anchor trajectory and load capacity have limited their application to temporary mooring systems. This paper presents a design model for predicting VLA performance during drag installation, shank release, and subsequent loading beyond the installation load. Model-based parametric studies on the effects of VLA fluke-shank angle and anchor line angle at the mudline are also presented.

The rotor effective wind speed was estimated using power, pitch angle and rotational speed as inputs combined with a generic C-P model. The results have been compared with Horns Rev-I dataset and NREL 5MW simulations under both downregulation and normal operation states. For the real-time flow recreation, the GCLarsen single wake model was re-calibrated using a 1-s dataset from Horns Rev and tested for the downregulated period.

However, the attenuation of light is significantly more pronounced in water than in air or in space, and so in order to obtain underwater images in colour, it is typically necessary to be within 2 to 3m of the seafloor. In addition to the high risk of collision when operating underwater vehicles at such low altitudes, the limited area of the seafloor covered in each image means large area surveys require a huge investment of time. In this research, we aim to increase the efficiency of mapping large areas of the seafloor by developing an underwater imaging system that can take colour images at ranges of up to 12 m, so that each image can cover a larger area, together with the necessary algorithms to automatically process the data it obtains. The system was deployed to map artificial hydrothermal vents in Iheya North Knoll using the ROV Hyper-Dolphin in October 2012. In this paper, we describe the methods used to process the data it obtains and present wide area 3D reconstructions of habitats surrounding artificial hydrothermal vents.

These temperature changes may adversely affect aquatic ecosystems especially by contributing to the decline of wildlife populations and habitat destruction. Any practice that affects the equilibrium of an aquatic environment may alter the temperature of that environment and subsequently cause thermal pollution. There may be some positive effects, though, to thermal pollution, including the extension of fishing seasons and rebounding of some wildlife populations. Thermal pollution may come in the form of warm or cold water being dumped into a lake, river, or ocean. Increased sediment build-up in a body of water affects its turbidity or cloudiness and may decrease its depth, both of which may cause a rise in water temperature. Increased sun exposure may also raise water temperature. Dams may change a river habitat into a lake habitat by creating a reservoir (man-made lake) behind the dam. The reservoir water temperature is often colder than the original stream or river. The sources and causes of thermal pollution are varied, which makes it difficult to calculate the extent of the problem. Because the thermal pollution caused by Hydropower Plants (HPPs) may not directly affect human health, it is neglected in general. Therefore, sources and results of thermal pollution in HPPs are ignored in general.

The ayu Plecoglossus altivelis altivelis is an amphidromous fish that spends its early ontogenetic stages in suitable nurseries, the surf zone, within 2 km from river mouths. To evaluate the possible impact of habitat loss on larval and juvenile ayu, we collected 50 juveniles from the Takahashi River, Okayama, Japan, on 19 April 2018, where more than 95% of the coastal outlet area is covered with artificial structures. Otolith Sr/Ca- and increment analyses were conducted to examine the habitat use and growth rates of each individual. We also collected nine larvae on 27 December 2018 from a semi-natural surf zone, which is located 5 km from the Takahashi River mouth, in order to evaluate their growth rate. The 50 juveniles spent approximately one-third of their marine life stage in estuaries with brackish water, suggesting that the estuaries are the only nursery grounds remaining in this area. Among the 50 juveniles, specimens that experienced lower salinities showed higher growth rates and larger body sizes in the larval stage (1-80 days old). However, a large variation in growth rates was also observed among the specimens that grew in estuaries, probably owing to environmental instability in the area. While the difference was not statistically significant, the nine larvae from the semi-natural surf zone showed higher growth rates than the 50 juveniles from the Takahashi River. Our results indicate that the estuaries can be an alternative habitat, but that they might not be a better habitat than the regular surf zone habitat.",,,,,,,,,5,0,0,0,4,0,5,,,0272-7714,1096-0015,,,,,,,,,,"Nagasaki Univ, Grad Sch Fisheries & Environm Sci, 1-14 Bunkyo Machi, Nagasaki, Nagasaki 8528521, JapanUniv Tokyo, Atmosphere & Ocean Res Inst, 5-1-5 Kashiwanoha, Kashiwa, Chiba 2778564, Japan",,,,2020-12-08,WOS:000582677500034,,,,,

Evacuation systems are typically comprised of several different components or subsystems. These subsystems allow evacuees a choice in response to the emergency incident onboard the installation, as well as to environmental conditions off the installation. This paper discusses four possible evacuation means-preferred, primary, secondary and tertiary. Of these four techniques, only the preferred means of evacuation is not strongly influenced by the ice regime around the structure. This paper examines these ice regimes and quantifies the size of the broken ice region around a structure for different ice conditions. A large number of parameters affect the size of this broken ice zone including the general ice regime, the existence of a grounded rubble field, the failure mode of the ice, the ice thickness, and the ice roughness. Typical damage zone extent is extremely variable and can be in the order of 25 m from the structure for ice thickness of 1.5 m.

In the stochastic analysis, a random type of wave forces derived from the Morison equation for small bodies was applied. Results of the vibration responses for the system with added damping devices were presented and compared to the responses of structures with traditional design.

Taxon richness of infauna was lower close to the OAR (15, 30 m), and abundances of total infauna elevated at 15 m, driven largely by two families of polychaete (Onuphidae and Spionidae). Sediment characteristics (grain size, total organic carbon, metals) did not vary with distance from the OAR. Using unbaited videos we established that fish foraging activity on the soft sediments was enhanced close to the OAR (15 m), with a 5-10 fold increase in total foraging time that was largely accounted for by the activity of four benthivorous fish species (blue morwong Nemadactylus douglasii, the silver trevally Pseudocaranx georgianus, and goatfishes Upeneichthys vlamingii and U. lineatus).

These species include 10 actinopterygii, 6 crustacean, 3 echinodermata, and 1 mollusc species which of these, six species have economic value. The results demonstrated that artificial reefs could increase the species composition in the area. Inachus dorsettensis (28.64%) and Carcinus aestuarii (25.91%) species constitute 55% of the total individuals recorded around the artificial reefs. Therefore, although these artificial reefs are species-specific for lobsters, their ecological function is also important for other species. This paper put forward that different artificial reef models served as alternative habitats for feeding, sheltering, and protecting the marine species. Then, their ecological function should be studied in detail. On the other hand, more investigations on different artificial reef models are required to protect and ensure the sustainability of the marine species stocks around artificial reefs in further researches.",,,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,,,2538-5542,2538-2705,,,,,,,,,,"Canakkale Onsekiz Mart Univ, Gokceada Sch Appl Sci, Dept Fisheries Technol, TR-17760 Gokceada, Canakkale, TurkeyCanakkale Onsekiz Mart Univ, Fac Marine Sci & Technol, Dept Fishing & Fish Proc Technol, TR-17020 Canakkale, Turkey",,,,2020-04-02,WOS:000520532800001,,,,,

For design or assessment purposes a real load spectrum is translated into a sequence of blocks with different but constant amplitude stress reversals. The block load variations can generate non-linear transients in the crack growth rate, i.e. crack growth acceleration or retardation effects. However these are generally ignored in design and a linear damage accumulation method is used to estimate fatigue lifetime. To investigate the effect of block loading transients on fatigue crack growth, different Delta K block loading schemes have been designed. So-called ESE(T) specimens manufactured from two offshore steel grades have been subjected to variable amplitude tests in air according to these loading schemes. To avoid additional effects of weld process parameters, possible weld flaws, weld microstructure heterogeneity, residual stress on crack path and crack growth, plain material has been chosen for this study. Retardation of crack growth has been evidenced for transitions to blocks with lower Delta K amplitude, further called high-low sequences. This retardation effect increased for larger jumps in amplitude and lower Delta K values. Crack arrest was evidenced at transition block ratios (Delta Ki-1/Delta K-i) higher than 2.2 to 2.4; the exact values depending on how close the stress intensity range is to the threshold value.",,,,,,,,,8,0,0,0,0,0,8,,,0951-8339,1873-4170,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Ghent, Dept Elect Energy Met Mech Construct & Syst, Tech Lane Ghent Sci,Pk Campus A 904, BE-9052 Zwijnaarde, BelgiumSIM Vzw, Tech Lane Ghent Sci,Pk Campus A 935, BE-9052 Zwijnaarde, Belgium",SIM Vzw,,,2019-02-21,WOS:000458228900027,,,,,

Wind power predictions improve the economical and technical integration of large capacities of wind energy into the existing electricity grid. Trading, balancing, grid operation and safety increase the importance of forecasting electrical outputs from wind farms. Thus wind power forecast systems have to be integrated into the control room of the transmission system operator (TSO). Very high requirements of reliability and safety make this integration especially challenging.The pooling of several large offshore wind farms into clusters in the GW range will make new options feasible for an optimized integration of wind power. The geographically distributed onshore wind farms will be aggregated to clusters, for the purpose of operating these wind farms as one large (virtual) wind power plant. For this purpose, a new structure, the wind farm cluster will be introduced. All wind farms, which are directly or indirectly connected to one transmission network node will be associated to one wind farm cluster.

Underwater anthropogenic sound levels in the ocean are increasing, and the evidence for impacts of sound on marine life is overwhelming. Currently, regulatory bodies require emitted sound from marine renewable energy projects to be assessed in order to infer potential impacts on marine life. Geometric spreading models are sometimes used to assess likely ecological impacts of anthropogenic sound by estimating the propagation of underwater sound without in situ verification.2. This study investigated the propagation of anthropogenic sound in shallow waters (25-45 m deep) from a single monopole (a single loudspeaker) and twin monopole (two loudspeakers) sound sources replaying tidal turbine sound to approximate anthropogenic sound sources in this environment.3. Greater sound levels at 100-800, 801-2000 and 2001-20000Hz were observed at all observation distances from the sound source for the twin monopole compared to the single monopole. These results suggest that the sound from multiple anthropogenic sound sources installed in one location is likely to be cumulative in the environment where their sound fields overlap.4. Sound intensities observed in both the single monopole and twin monopole experiments for 01-20 kHz were higher than estimates derived from standard geometric spreading models for underwater sound by 3-41 dB across all measured distances from the source. The greatest difference from the theoretical spherical spreading model (41 dB) occurred at the site most distant from the twin monopole sound source, that is, 5 km.5. Synthesis and applications. The results show that geometric models used by some regulatory bodies may be underestimating the spatial extent to which the anthropogenic underwater sound may be propagating and creating potential ecological impacts. Based on field measurements, we have presented an alternative model which should assist regulatory agencies to better estimate and manage ecological impacts from anthropogenic underwater sound.",,,,,,,,,19,0,0,0,14,0,22,,,0021-8901,1365-2664,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Auckland, Inst Marine Sci, Auckland 1, New Zealand",,,,2014-02-12,WOS:000329846500004,,,,,

The objective of this paper is to review and critically examine recent developments in system reliability methods for fixed steel offshore platforms specifically and identify areas that need to be examined further to maximise the benefits from the use of these techniques.The paper examines the range of proposed methods for system reliability assessment of fixed steel offshore structures under extreme environmental loading. The associated characteristics of the various methods are examined and the paper concentrates in particular on the treatment of the resistance. The various system effects including both deterministic and probabilistic effects and their relative contribution to the overall system reliability are addressed. Key issues such as the modelling uncertainties and sensitivities, validation and benchmarking of the proposed methods are also examined. The study also highlights a number of technical and philosophical issues which need to be addressed to increase the benefits from system reliability applications in design and re-assessment of fixed platforms.

In this work, underwater visual census techniques were applied to describe spatial and temporal patterns of fish assemblages associated with extractive platforms. Data were collected during three seasons according to the following spatial factors: Location (Adriatic and Ionian Seas), Depth (0-6 m and 12-18 m) and Distance from the platform (external and internal). Both univariate and multivariate analyses showed highly significant differences for each factor assessed in this study, as well as for the interaction among said factors. Results indicated that artificial structures in both the Adriatic and Ionian Seas act as artificial reefs attracting reef-dwelling or partially reef-dwelling species, which are not present far from the platforms in open waters. Results also showed significant differences between Ionian and Adriatic fish assemblages, with a higher mean density of fish and a greater mean number of species in the latter basin. Boops boops, Chromis chromis and several species belonging to the Blennidae family most contributed to these differences. This is likely due to the eutrophication that involves the coast of the northern and central Adriatic, allowing a high production of fish, especially planctivorous. Thanks to the eutrophication, platforms located in this basin are characterized by a greater abundance of fouling organisms which offer a perfect habitat for cryptobenthic species, such as Blennids. Moreover, Thalassoma pavo and Scorpaena maderensis, thermophilic species, were more abundant in the Ionian platforms than in the Adriatic ones thus contributing to the dissimilarities between these two basins. Present results could bear strong implications for the environmental management of drilling and production activities in different basins. Assessing biodiversity in these highly complex contexts is a challenge for the near future, and the existence of a reliable method such as UVC would affect international research in this field.

First, there are engineering aspects such as increase in structural loading of the structure, affecting the dynamic response for the drag forces, calculated by naval engineers. Second, there are fouling problems at the heating exchange mechanisms and other pipes collecting sea water (problems similar to power plants located on the coast using sea water for cooling). Finally, we have the transport of fouling from one biogeographical region to another. The rapidly rising world energy requirement, with platforms being built in different shipyards of the world, creates an artificial situation of a sessile benthic organism (biofouling) being transported from one ocean to another. These unintentional introductions of non-native aquatic organisms have resulted in the establishment of many species beyond their native ranges (Gollasch, 2002).Also, with the oil and gas industry going deeper, we have a completely new situation, which consists in artificial structures being placed in the deep blue. Normally, we would expect not much biofouling in the middle of the ocean, on the continental slope (deep sea); however, recent results have been showing that there is great growth of marine fouling attaching to the platforms and risers in the deep sea.In this chapter, we will discuss this new situation of offshore and deep-sea biofouling and its implications on operational and environmental aspects for the oil and gas industry.",,,,,,,,,21,0,0,0,6,0,21,,,,,978-1-84569-386-2,,,,,,,,,,,,,2009-01-01,WOS:000276378700006,,,,,

The second and third stages of the project will analyse loads from wind and waves on offshore wind structures. The fourth stage will examine the associated structural and geotechnical design. An ongoing theme throughout the project will be directed towards outreach, networking and dissemination. The project will improve our understanding of the underlying physical processes as well as exploring the design and environmental implications. In particular, the first theme will provide a better fundamental understanding of typhoon-wave interactions, an important topic in its own right in ocean environmental science.The project will use a wide-range of techniques to tackle the particular problems.

We find that the size of the wind wake is an important factor for the oceanic response to the wind farm. We show through simple analytical models and idealized numerical experiments that a wind speed of 5-10 m/s may generate upwelling/downwelling velocities exceeding 1 m/day if the characteristic width of the wind wake is of the same size or larger than the internal radius of deformation. The generated upwelling is sufficiently enough that the local ecosystem will most likely be strongly influenced by the presence of a wind farm. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Response surfaces fitted to response parameters of a reduced number of short-term sea states, usually between 12 and 16, are used to define the parameters of other sea states inside the key region, allowing a fast long-term response evaluation. The selection of the scatter diagram key region is bounded by extreme environmental contour lines. The suitability of the KRLTA results is evaluated by inspecting the contribution coefficients for the long-term response of the sea states contained in the key region.The application of the KRLTA is demonstrated in the estimation of the long-term extreme generalized load effect (or utilization ratio) of three sections of a steel catenary riser connected to a FPSO under North Sea environmental conditions. The results obtained with the KRLTA using only numerical simulations of 12 sea states are compared with those from a full long-term analysis (FLTA), which demands about 500 sea states to be analyzed, and with results obtained by the currently used environmental contour method (ECM).The obtained results indicate that KRLTA can achieve similar estimates of a FLTA, with computational effort similar to the ECM. Thus, the new KRLTA procedure allows long-term analyses of complex structures such as riser systems, mooring lines and tension leg platforms tendons, with computational efforts comparable to the approximate methods currently applied on the design of these systems.",,,,,,,,,6,0,0,0,0,0,6,,,0951-8339,1873-4170,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Fed Rio de Janeiro, Rio De Janeiro, BrazilPetr Brasileiro SA, PETROBRAS, Rio De Janeiro, Brazil",,,,2019-02-21,WOS:000458228900020,,,,,

In this study, oil and gas status in Malaysian scenario is reconnoitered. As the sea wave influences greatly on offshore structures, approaches for collecting wave data are sight-seen. The structural configuration and characteristics of compliant floating spar platform for energy extraction are addressed. The study reveals that the continental shelf offshore of Malaysian waters is divided into seven sedimentary basins, among which three basins have major ongoing oil and gas extraction activity. Around 68% oil and 86% natural gas of the country's reserves are located in East Malaysia at offshore Sabah and Sarawak. Except the Kebabangan field, all the other offshore energy reserves are located at more than 1000 m depth. In lieu of a fixed platform, a floating platform will be a competent energy extraction structure in this deeper water. The deep water wave data can be appropriately obtained in satellite altimetry approach for its extent of accuracy.

This can be used as habitat by fish and benthic plants and animals. Apart from studies of colonization of artificial reefs, which are usually deployed specifically to enhance populations of fish or to replace degraded habitat, there have been few studies that have specifically examined the use of waste material as habitat. Neither have previous studies compared different types of waste material that one characteristically finds in urbanized estuaries, nor the use of small patches of habitat typically created by waste. Spatial comparisons of species found on previously dumped artificial material may be confounded by the fact that different types of waste may be dumped in different places, or may be of different age. This study built small patch reefs of three different types of widespread waste material (lyres, wood or metal) and compared colonization of these over 19 months to colonization of patch reefs of similar age and size made from natural sandstone. Algal assemblages were similar among the different types of reefs, with all showing more cover and diversity on horizontal surfaces. Invertebrates similarly showed few differences among reefs, although there was greater diversity, primarily due to bryozoans, on the vertical surfaces of wooden reefs. Fish rapidly colonized and used all reefs, with cryptic species showing no differences among types of reefs. Schooling species were, however, more common on all of the waste reefs than on the natural sandstone reefs. Small patches of waste material dumped in estuaries can therefore provide useable habitat for a wide range of estuarine organisms and may form a valuable resource if natural habitats continue to be degraded or lost. Although we are not advocating that rubbish simply be discarded into estuaries with the excuse that it provides habitat, removal of existing rubbish should be considered in terms of multiple changes and disturbances to the environment.

The field data associated with MBF and with intertidal substrates indicated 133 species as potential components of the Chacao channel's MBF.

There is mounting evidence for the ecological benefits of such structures, not least for marine fish. In the United States of America, MMS (particularly oil rigs) are used as reefs to successfully enhance fisheries in the so-called, Rig to Reefs programme. In Europe the opposite occurs: international regulations governing the North Sea (i.e. OSPAR Decision 98/3) require the complete removal of disused offshore installations. In the North Sea it is well known that fish aggregate at MMS and oil and gas MMS have 500 m fishery exclusion zones. So the structures act as small marine protected areas. At this scale, the total area protected is very small relative to the area occupied by commercial fish stocks in the North Sea. However, there is also evidence that aggregations of fish extend well beyond the exclusion zone, which is either a result of aggregation towards the MMS or enhanced productivity and protection resulting in fish spilling over into the adjacent area. The spillover effect is a well-known benefit of marine protected areas but has not been studied in relation to MMS in the North Sea. If this spillover is significant, then the area influence of MMS could be greater than hitherto assumed.Here, we use an unmanned surface vehicle equipped with state of the art high resolution acoustic surveying techniques to evaluate the scale of aggregation and spillover effect of fish from North Sea MMS. Data from the surveys are used to parameterise a high spatial resolution model of fish dynamics and movements which we will use test hypotheses about the whole North Sea scale effects of networks of structures, including the extent to which they arise from enhanced productivity or the protection from fishing afforded by proximity to hard substrate, and the North Sea scale consequences of their removal.. Our results will be used by oil and gas operators in the North Sea, one of which is a partner in our project, to inform their cumulative impact assessments. This will provide evidence for derogating removal, which as stated by the CEO of the Scottish Wildlife Trust, in a parliamentary committee, could result in a triple win, with ...substantial savings to the taxpayer and substantial savings to the operator. There could be a net positive effect on the environment in the retention of these sometimes highly biodiverse areas around rigs and other structures.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,NE/T010770/1,,,,,,,,University of Strathclyde,,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:15340325,,,,,

It is difficult to obtain structural system reliability with respect to complicated systems with numerous failure modes and dependency consideration among them. This paper applies the combination of the weakest failure modes theory with structural reliability theory to conduct reliability analysis on of side by-side offloading mooring system of FPSO. Firstly, the numerical simulation of the system in different conditions is addressed to acquire the statistical data of time-history stress of components including hawsers, fenders and yoke, based on which, the reliability indexes of all the failure modes and correlation coefficient matrix are derived. Then the weakest failure modes, i.e. the representative failure modes that have significant impact on the system, are located through Probability Network Evaluation Technique. The probability of structural system is estimated through the weakest failure modes by considering the system as series. The analysis results indicate that two environment conditions (0 degrees && and 0 degrees && in combinations of wave, wind and current) are relative dangerous, which is in good correspondence with the practical expertise. The method is verified to be an effective and convenient evaluation approach for structural reliability analysis in terms of complex systems. It is beneficial for the identification of structure indicators from the weakest failure mode group and conduct optimum of structural system configurations in the design stage. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

This has recently led to the introduction of the concrete-filled stainless steel tubular (CFSST) columns, which benefit from the stainless steel as a superior metallic corrosion resistant material. Accordingly, CFSST short columns have recently attracted the scientific community. However, circular CFSST slender columns have received very little attention. Currently, this paper provides a nonlinear finite element (FE) inelastic analysis for the axially-loaded circular CFSST slender columns to substitute the lack in their behaviour; especially when the relative cheap lean duplex stainless steel material (EN 1.4162) is utilised. The FE models are firstly validated by using the available test results in literature. This validation stage is, then, followed by a parametric analysis to explore the fundamental behaviour of such columns considering the most important factors. The paper divides the slender columns into intermediate length and long columns based on the type of the overall buckling that takes place, and then the behavioural differences between both types are clearly addressed. The obtained FE axial strengths are additionally compared with those predicted by the European (EC4) and American (AISC) specifications.

In fact, forecasting foundation behavior demands a correct evaluation of the combined effects of construction phasing, spatial variability of the soil mechanical properties, uncertainties on the applied loadings and due to the geomaterial mechanical modeling techniques. For offshore platforms, this is compounded by the hazardous nature of environmental loadings. These loadings, which are often very severe, could have disastrous effects on structure behavior. This dissertation presents the synthesis of a ten-year research program, developed by a team of Institut Francais du Petrole, with the cooperation of university teams, technical centers and industrial companies. The objective was to set up methodologies and numerical tools for the behavior of typical offshore structure foundations, spanning their entire life.It is presented in two distinct parts. The first part presents specific methodologies for the soil/structure interaction analysis of offshore platforms, and discusses the development of rheological models for soil behavior under nonmonotonous loading. The second part considers the use of these sophisticated models for analyzing offshore structure foundations. It shows how these models are integrated in the FONDOF/IFP software, by using the finite element method coupled with algorithms specific to the problems posed by offshore foundations. Several applications are presented, demonstrating the ability of these methods to describe observed phenomena. A special place is reserved for the description of a quality assurance process developed by the French GRECO CNRS 'Geomaterials' Group of university teams, technical centers and industrial companies.

Biofouling, the accumulation of biological growth on submerged surfaces such vessel hulls and artificial structures, is an important transport pathway that can facilitate the establishment of marine non-indigenous species in new locations. Despite efforts to develop effective tools to eradicate newly established populations before they become widespread and beyond control, eradication successes are scarce in the marine environment. This paper describes a dredge-based eradication of the brown mussel Perna perna from a deep (c. 44 m) soft-sediment habitat in central New Zealand, following the discovery of this species amongst biofouling organisms physically removed (i.e. defouled) from a drilling rig.2. We evaluated the efficacy of dredging in removing P. perna and other target species, and determined whether a density-based eradication success criterion had been achieved. The catchability coefficient (q) of the defouled material was estimated using catch data, and the dredge efficiency (E) was determined. Initial and remaining mussel densities were then calculated using estimates of E. The reliability of these estimates was tested by simulations.3. A total of 227 dredge tows covering c. 94% of a 12 center dot 6 ha target area were undertaken, and an estimated 35 tonnes of material defouled from the rig was dredged from the seabed and disposed of in a landfill.4. Estimates of q and E were 0 center dot 0054 and 0 center dot 30 (respectively) and mussel densities at the completion of the eradication programme were estimated to be c. 0 center dot 5 m-2, well below the success criterion of 10 m-2. From our simulations, it was estimated that 71 dredge tows would be required to remove 50% of the initial population, whilst 232 dredge tows would be needed to achieve a 90% reduction in population size.5. Synthesis and applications. The eradication of non-indigenous bivalves from a relatively deep (> 40 m) soft-sediment environment is unprecedented and highlights that, with appropriate tools and other resources, eradication is feasible even in challenging circumstances. Where complete elimination of a pest is not feasible, alternative density-based success criteria can be developed that, if achieved, can effectively mitigate risks. This study highlights the need for further development of both vector treatment options and pest eradication tools, and improved policy surrounding in-water defouling in the coastal environment.",,,,,,,,,36,0,0,0,35,0,39,,,0021-8901,1365-2664,,,,,,,,,,"Cawthron Inst, Nelson 7010, New ZealandVictoria Univ Wellington, Sch Biol Sci, Ctr Marine Environm & Econ Res, Wellington, New Zealand",,,,2011-04-01,WOS:000288379000018,,,,,

One explanation for these patterns may be the lack of some microhabitats on seawalls. Preliminary observations suggested that some features of sandstone seawalls, such as the presence of crevices among blocks, may provide chitons with an important habitat. To test the hypothesis that numbers of the chiton, Sypharochiton pelliserpentis, would be greater in crevices than on exposed surfaces of seawalls, sampling was done on sandstone seawalls in Sydney Harbour. S. pelliserpentis were more abundant in crevices among blocks than on exposed surfaces. Experimental manipulations transplanting chitons to exposed surfaces showed that they were found in greater numbers in crevices where those were available than on exposed surfaces. Chitons transplanted to blocks where crevices had been filled tended to move to non-filled crevices on other blocks. The design of seawalls could easily be improved to offer a better habitat for survival and maintenance of species such as chitons by incorporating crevices and similar features. In an increasingly urbanized world, understanding how to improve the value as habitat of man-made structures will be essential for conserving biodiversity.

Based on previously observed patterns around other types of artificial structures, it was predicted that assemblages of animals under pontoons would be different from those in similar areas away from pontoons. Hypotheses about overall differences in average abundance and composition between sites with and without pontoons were tested, as were hypotheses about variable differences among and within estuaries. Analyses revealed that there were fewer crustaceans under pontoons in one estuary. The most conspicuous patterns related to pontoons were, however, differences in variability among sites with pontoons compared to sites without pontoons. Differences in spatial variability were found for the overall multivariate structure using Bray-Curtis dissimilarities and for abundances of most major taxa. Total abundance was approximately 60 times more variable among sites without pontoons and number of taxa were seven times more variable among sites with pontoons. Such patterns indicate that impacts of pontoons occur at some sites but not at others. This may be explained by intrinsic differences among sites or by differences in practices for maintenance. Predictions from these two contrasting models need to be tested in order to achieve efficient management of this type of structure. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Various reasons have been proposed to explain this phenomenon including increased human disturbance, pollution, or changes in coral reef biota that serve a major ecological function such as depletion of grazers. However, pinpointing the actual factors potentially responsible can be problematic. Here we show a phase shift from coral to the corallimorpharian Rhodactis howesii associated with a long line vessel that wrecked in 1991 on an isolated atoll (Palmyra) in the central Pacific Ocean. We documented high densities of R. howesii near the ship that progressively decreased with distance from the ship whereas R. howesii were rare to absent in other parts of the atoll. We also confirmed high densities of R. howesii around several buoys recently installed on the atoll in 2001. This is the first time that a phase shift on a coral reef has been unambiguously associated with man-made structures. This association was made, in part, because of the remoteness of Palmyra and its recent history of minimal human habitation or impact. Phase shifts can have long-term negative ramification for coral reefs, and eradication of organisms responsible for phase shifts in marine ecosystems can be difficult, particularly if such organisms cover a large area. The extensive R. howesii invasion and subsequent loss of coral reef habitat at Palmyra also highlights the importance of rapid removal of shipwrecks on corals reefs to mitigate the potential of reef overgrowth by invasives.",,,,,,,,,78,0,0,0,71,1,96,,,1932-6203,,,,,,,,,,,"US Geol Survey, Natl Wildlife Hlth Ctr, Honolulu Field Stn, Honolulu, HI USAUniv Hawaii, Hawaii Inst Marine Biol, Honolulu, HI 96822 USAUS Fish & Wildlife Serv, Pacific Isl Refuges, Honolulu, HI USA",,,,2008-08-20,WOS:000264420900015,18714355,,,,

For the most part, carbonate soils are of biogenic origin comprising skeleton bodies and shells of small organisms, the shelly carbonate sands. These soils are a complex and poorly understood material as evidenced by a number of accidents reported during platform installation in the 80s. As a consequence, shelly sands have been placed into a niche classification of problematic soils in most design guides. While failures are now relatively rare, conservative methods and high factors of safety are commonly used. Understanding the behaviour of shelly carbonate sand is critical for the design of foundations for offshore structures. In particular, understanding the physical phenomena taking place at the microscale has the potential to spur the development of robust computational methods to be integrated into novel or existing design approaches.Image-based geomechanics is a fascinating research field that has the potential to transform the way soils are investigated and modeled. The ability to follow deformation at the microscale has helped to answer fundamental questions about the soil behaviour observed at the macro-scale. The proposed research uses 4D synchrotron x-ray imaging and post analysis to investigate the kinematics and the strain maps of a shelly carbonate sand under compression. The outcomes will contribute scientific understanding on the multiscale behaviour of shelly carbonate sands. This will form the basis to develop fabric-informed constitutive models to better predict the soil response, thus improving design practices for foundations of offshore structures. The ambition of this project is to contribute towards safer, less conservative and more sustainable ground structures and reduce the financial risks associated with unforeseen ground response during construction of offshore foundations. This multiscale methodology and image algorithms here developed, will be valuable to the broad granular media community to simulate mechanical processes in additive manufacturing, mining, food and pharmaceutical industries.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,EP/N018168/1,,,,,,,,"City, University of London","City, University of London",,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:15370158,,,,,

We found that fish assemblages associated with breakwalls were more diverse than those associated with natural reefs in two of the three regions studied. The functional niches being filled were similar at both habitats, with the exception of a higher abundance of piscivores at some breakwalls.

This study aims to collect baseline data for all species of bats in the region, with focused analyses on the three bat species to: - Identify hotspots for the three species for advising on future wind energy development. - Discuss the significance of the three species at wind farms in relation to the survey findings. - Produce revised population estimates for the three target species. - To identify any noteworthy local bat species assemblages (all species). Main findings - 715 different 1 km squares (3.4% of the survey area) were surveyed for bats in 2016. This sample comprised 1,537 complete nights of recording in 1,422 different recording locations. 667,755 recordings were collected which, following analyses and validation, were found to include 399,242 bat recordings. - The ranges occupied by noctule, Leisler's bat and Nathusius' pipistrelle in southern Scotland are restricted with little overlap between species. For the two Nyctalus species, there is a clear east-west split, with Leisler's bat occurring in the west and noctule mainly in the east. For both Leisler's bat and noctule, occupancy and activity patterns were particularly aggregated, with a comparatively small number of 1 km squares contributing a large proportion of the recorded distribution and activity. Nathusius' pipistrelle was recorded at few sites, dispersed across the survey area, with some clustering of records in the southwest and the north of the region. - We estimate that 16% and 24% of the populations of the three high risk species are exposed to existing and approved wind farms, with 50% of this exposure at just 10% of wind farms. Whilst wind farms tended to be located at higher elevation than the three high-risk bat species most commonly occur, there was still significant spatial overlap. Because there is little overlap in the ranges of the three high risk bat species, any steps taken to reduce the risk posed by wind farms at a local scale are most likely to benefit a single species, rather than having broader benefits for the three high risk species. - It is likely that the true population estimates for the two Nyctalus species are likely to far exceed the current published estimates of a few hundred individuals for the whole of Scotland. Considering that the 715 1 km squares surveyed in 2016 comprised just 3.4% of the survey area, and that there were 4,327 recordings of Leisler's bat from 224 1 km squares, and 2,101 recordings of noctule from 152 1 km squares, it is likely that the minimum population sizes of Leisler's bat and noctule for the whole of Scotland are in the thousands. Indications from the survey are that Nathusius' pipistrelle was much less abundant than the two Nyctalus species in southern Scotland, with just 185 recordings from 23 1 km squares. Considering the migratory status of Nathusius' pipistrelle it is likely that some records of this species in this survey, particularly at coastal locations, were of migrants. However at one site close to Stranraer (Dumfries and Galloway) in the southwest of the survey area, male advertisement calls were recorded, which may suggest the possibility of breeding in this area. It is expected that the minimum population size of Nathusius' pipistrelle in Scotland is likely to be in the hundreds.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,1759-4014,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2017-01-01,ZOOREC:ZOOR15504019324,,,,,

Here, our objectives were to describe the marine fauna of the area of the port of Sao Sebastiao (on the northern coast of the state of Sao Paulo, in the Sao Sebastiao Channel, SSC) to detect introduced species. Descriptions of the faunal community of the SSC with respect to native and allochthonous (invasive or potentially so) diversity are lacking for all invertebrate groups. Sampling was carried out by specialists within each taxonomic group, in December 2009, following the protocol of the Rapid Assessment Survey (RAS) in three areas with artificial structures as substrates. A total of 142 species were identified (61 native, 15 introduced, 62 cryptogenic, 4 not classified), of which 17 were Polychaeta (12, 1, 1, 3), 24 Ascidiacea (3, 6, 15, 0), 36 Bryozoa (17, 0, 18, 1), 27 Cnidaria (2, 1, 24, 0), 20 Crustacea (11, 4, 5, 0), 2 Entoprocta (native), 16 Mollusca (13, 3, 0, 0). Twelve species are new occurrences for the SSC. Among the introduced taxa, two are new for coastal Brazil. Estimates of introduced taxa are conservative as the results of molecular studies suggest that some species previously considered cryptogenic are indeed introduced. We emphasize that the large number of cryptogenic species illustrates the need for a long-term monitoring program, especially in areas most susceptible to bioinvasion. We conclude that rapid assessment studies, even in relatively well-known regions, can be very useful for the detection of introduced species and we recommend that they be carried out on a larger scale in all ports with heavy ship traffic.",,,,,,,,,40,0,0,0,41,4,43,,,0718-560X,0717-7178,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Fed Parana, Dept Zool, BR-81531980 Curitiba, Parana, BrazilUniv Fed Parana, Dept Zool, BR-81531980 Curitiba, Parana, BrazilUniv Sao Paulo, Ctr Biol Marinha, BR-11600000 Cabelo Gordo, Sao Sebastiao, BrazilUniv Fed Ceara, Ctr Ciencias, Dept Biol, BR-60455760 Fortaleza, Ceara, BrazilUniv Fed Pernambuco, Dept Oceanog, BR-50740550 Recife, PE, BrazilUniv Fed Ceara, Inst Ciencias Mar, BR-60165081 Fortaleza, Ceara, BrazilUniv Fed Parana, Dept Fisiol, BR-81531980 Curitiba, Parana, Brazil",,,,2013-09-18,WOS:000322261700006,,,,,

The programmable scanning LIDAR under development will bring a step change in LIDAR measurement capability and enable wind farm operators to really know the wind profile that is hitting their turbine, rather than being kept ignorant by unrepresentative hub height measurements. A number of innovative steps will be employed in order to improve accuracy and capability. This will enable the total farm output to be forecast from seconds to minutes ahead, thus enabling truly flexible grid resource planning. The system will also offer savings by reducing infrastructure failure rates. This will be achieved by augmenting condition monitoring systems with detailed mapping of the incident wind vector field. As an added bonus the system will highlight yaw misalignment. The system will assist wind turbine parameter tuning so that wind turbine may be set up like a race car for the relevant operating conditions.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,101967,,,,,,,,Sgurrenergy Limited,,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:15327784,,,,,

Of the 5,085 traps set, 60% were classified as functional when retrieved. Evidence of lake trout egg deposition was documented in each of the lakes studied at 14 of 29 sites. A total of 1,147 eggs were trapped. The percentage of traps functioning and catch per effort were compared among sites based on depth, timing of egg deposition, distance from shore, size of reef and type of reef(artificial or natural). Most eggs were caught on small, shallow, protected reefs that were close to shore. Use of disk traps on large, shallow, unprotected offshore reefs or along unprotected shorelines was generally unsuccessful due to the effects of heavy wind and wave action. Making multiple lifts at short intervals, and retrieval before and re-deployment after storms are recommended for use in exposed al eas. On large reefs, preliminary surveys to identify preferred lake trout spawning habitat may be required to deploy disk traps most effectively.

The severe effects on biodiversity of the recent large-scale coastal land claim activities in China are well documented, yet some recent studies have emphasized the ecological opportunities provided by such artificial coastal infrastructure in China, in some cases suggesting that the ecological impacts of coastal infrastructure should be reconsidered due to benefits to some rocky shore species in a changing climate. This is cause for concern because, while studying the new ecology arising from coastal modification is useful, broad conclusions around the ecological role or conservation gains from seawall construction without adequate contextualization underplays the ecological consequences of large-scale coastal land claim, and could potentially undermine efforts to achieve biodiversity conservation. Here, we clarify the characteristics of seawall construction in China and summarize the environmental damage and some broadscale impacts caused by this type of infrastructure expansion on the endangered Yellow Sea tidal flats ecosystem.

Some of these pollutants elicit estrogenic responses in fish, but their effects on the endocrine system of molluscs are largely unknown. In this study, mussels Mytilus edulis were exposed to North Sea oil (0) and the mixture of North Sea oil + alkylphenols (OAP), and the effects on tissue steroid levels and steroid metabolism (P450-aromatase and estradiol-sulfotransferase)were monitored. Levels of free testosterone and free estradiol were much higher in gonad tissue than in peripheral tissue, whereas esterified steroids (released after saponification) were of the same order of magnitude in both tissues. Levels of free steroids determined in gonads were not affected by exposure, but esterified steroids significantly increased in OAP exposed mussels (up to 2.4-fold). The sulfation of estradiol was investigated as a conjugation pathway, and increased activities were observed in digestive gland cytosol of both 0 and OAP exposure groups (up to 2.8-fold). Additionally, increased P450-aromatase activity was determined in OAP exposed mussels (up to three-fold, both in gonad and digestive gland), but not in the 0 group. Altogether, the results indicate that North Sea oil leads to increased sulfation of estradiol, and that in combination with alkylphenols, additional alterations are observed: increased P450-aromatase, and increased levels of esterified-steroids in gonads. Nonetheless, mussels are able to maintain gonad concentrations of free steroids unaltered, possibly via homeostatic mechanisms such as the conjugation with fatty acid or the formation of sulphate conjugates.

Determination of precise chronology of these proxies such as corals (both shallow and deep-sea), fish bones (otoliths), mollusks, speleothems, and inorganic carbonates that precipitate from natural reservoirs and man-made structures therefore becomes very important. The chronological retrieval of the archived records in these proxies are relevant to several important issues that include development of fisheries management strategies, reconstruction of environmental and geochemical changes that are taking place in coastal, estuarine and lacustrine waters and time frames of the initiation of degradation of engineering structures such as bridges. Several recent developments have contributed to high-precision dating of these carbonates.

Depth, slope, type of substratum, biotic cover and hydrodynamic conditions were recorded wherever sparid recruits occurred. Juvenile Diplodus annularis settled in Posidonia oceanica seagrass beds at 5-8 m deep. The five other sparid species recruited in very shallow water (<2 m). D. puntazzo, D. sargus and D. vulgaris were observed in sites presenting a gentle slope with coarse sand, gravel, pebbles or boulders. Sarpa salpa was less dependent on slope for recruitment, but was always associated with macroalgae. Oblada melanura settlement occurred on rocky areas with various slopes, and was favoured by the presence of overhangs. When growing, juvenile sparids extended their home range vertically into deeper zones, and laterally in more exposed areas. Time partitioning in the use of suitable microhabitats for recruitment was observed for some species. Juveniles of Diplodus puntazzo and D. vulgaris shared the same sites from March to May, both exhibiting relatively low abundances.

Following public outcry about attempts to dispose of the Brent Spar at sea in the 1990s, regulations were introduced that require oil and gas structures in the sea to be removed at the end of their useful lives. Much of the infrastructure in the North Sea is now at the end of its useful life, at least for the purposes for which it was installed, and is to be decommissioned. A large proportion of the cost of this is borne by taxpayers. Other approaches to decommissioning are possible. Elsewhere in the world redundant infrastructure has been left in situ to support wildlife or to limit seabed disturbance, relocated to form artificial reefs, repurposed to sequester CO2, and so on. The presumption of removal has held back consideration of alternative possibilities in the North Sea. At the same time, debate about alternatives is polarised, and there is a tendency to focus on individual cases rather than the whole North Sea (eco)system.The North Sea is a productive sea that, in addition to providing food, supports many industries other than the extraction of oil and gas. A large expansion in the amount of infrastructure being installed for wind generation is underway and planned to continue. Consideration needs to be given to what happens to this at the end of its useful life. Other man-made structures are also in the sea, such as wrecks, which provide havens for some species. The purpose of the DREAMS project is to bring together all available information about the effects of man-made structures on the marine ecosystem, and on the benefits that ecosystem provides for humans. This information will be analysed and combined with ecosystem models, to examine how different possible approaches to decommissioning lead to different outcomes. In particular the project will highlight trade-offs, where action taken to deliver one objective damages our ability to achieve a different objective. The overall aim is to provide comprehensive information to support decisions, representing a shift from individual, narrowly focused studies to a big picture research endeavor, designed to feed into addressing large social challenges and illustrate how marine science can underpin the provision of wide-ranging benefits to society.The research will involve the collection and analysis of large amounts of information concerning the effects of man-made structures in the sea.

Results affirmed that the supplementary cementing materials such as GGBS and SF significantly impacted and enhanced concrete resistivity to chloride ions penetration and hence decrease the corrosion activities on steel bars protected by such concretes. As for epoxy coated rebars applications under high chloride laden conditions, results showed great concern to integrity of the epoxy coating layer on the bar and its stability.

The Veslefrikk B (VFB) platform was built in 1985 for drilling exploration but was converted to a production platform in 1989. Shortly thereafter extensive fatigue cracking was discovered and several repairs were made. However, extensive fatigue cracking continued and a retrofitting program was implemented, using various types of grinding and peening techniques. In 1999 the platform was temporarily decommissioned and dry-docked for a comprehensive repair and upgrading program, following the International Institute of welding (IIW) guidelines for weld improvement methods (1), this was completed in only four months. However, after a few more years of service fatigue damage again necessitated new repairs. The majority of cracks occurred in the hull skin plates and caused water leakage. It is noteworthy that cracking this time occurred only in areas of the structure that were left untreated in the first retrofitting program due to low levels of stress from FE analyses in these areas. The paper describes the original repair and strengthening program, and the types of subsequent fatigue damage that necessitated new repairs.

This is used in the context of limit states design, which, in S.471, incorporates two safety classes. In order to provide consistent safety levels, the environmental loads are divided into categories based on frequent and rare occurrence, examples being waves and earth-quakes, respectively.

Fish assemblages were quantified from standing platforms and an array of artificial reef types (Liberty Ships and partially removed or toppled platforms) distributed over the Texas continental shelf.

ROVs captured a variety of species inhabiting these reefs from large transient piscivores to small herbivorous reef fishes. While structure type and relief were shown to influence species richness and community structure, major trends in species composition were largely explained by the bottom depth where these structures occurred. We observed a shift in fish communities and relatively high diversity at approximately 60 m bottom depth, confirming trends observed in previous studies of standing platforms. This depth was also correlated with some of the largest Red Snapper captured on supplementary vertical longline surveys. Our work indicates that managers of artificial reefing programs (e.g., Rigs-to-Reefs) in the GOM should carefully consider the ambient environmental conditions when designing reef sites. For the Texas continental shelf, reefing materials at a 50-60 m bottom depth can serve a dual purpose of enhancing diving experiences and providing the best potential habitat for relatively large Red Snapper.",,,,,,,,,96,5,0,0,79,0,115,,,1932-6203,,,,,,,,,,,"Texas A&M Univ, Harte Res Inst Gulf Mexico Studies, Corpus Christi, TX USATexas Parks & Wildlife Dept, Artificial Reef Program, Austin, TX 78744 USA",Texas Parks & Wildlife Dept,,,2015-05-08,WOS:000356768100113,25954943,,,,

Since then, approximately 60% of the offshore oil/gas production structures used globally have been erected in the GOM to support the production of energy resources. The shallow, shelf and shelf edge waters of the Gulf of Mexico have reached or are rapidly approaching production maturity, requiring that the fixed structures used to support energy production be removed or otherwise disposed of by suitable means. The use of energetic materials has been determined to be a safe, efficient and cost effective technology to remove fixed offshore structures whose service life has been exceeded.However, the use of explosives in an underwater environment raises concerns about safe loading, transport, and use of explosives offshore and the environmental impact of submerged explosions. Agencies of the federal and state governments active in management and oversight of the GOM have established policies concerning offshore explosive operations to promote safety and minimize the impact on the environment.This paper will describe the various types of offshore rig removal operations involving explosives, the marine habitat, underwater blast effects and their mitigation, a summary of the regulatory agencies with oversight over such operations, and a description of the codes required to be followed when conducting these operations. The alternative to the complete removal of platforms and structures for onshore disassembly such as the Rigs-to-Reefs program is discussed also. It should be noted that the management of GOM oil and gas lease abandonment is being observed by concerned organizations in other offshore regions such as the North Sea to determine how to manage their own rig removal or decommissioning programs.

J,,,,,,,,,LONG ZHANG,,Development and demonstration of methods and tools for large scale wind turbine pitch bearing condition assessment (DemoBearing),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Awarded Grant,May 28 2019,2019,"The UK is No. 1 in the world for installed offshore wind power and continues the deployment in a predominant speed in the next few decades to meet 2050 carbon emissions targets. The increasing sizes of offshore wind turbines pose significant challenges in the operation and maintenance of all its components. In particular, wind turbine pitch bearing, as the safety-critical interface between the turbine blade and the hub to rotate the blade for power generation optimisation and emergency stop, is typified as the large, slow, partially rotated bearing but it is the weak part and bottleneck for large offshore turbines (Emerging grand challenge). In addition, the UK will have a large number of onshore turbines approaching the end of their design life by 2030. The pitch bearing poses a significant risk for the decision making in ageing turbine decommissioning or life extension (Upcoming challenge). In-situ pitch bearings condition assessment is a major and open challenge for the whole wind industry as there are no industrial standards available yet and few existing in-situ methods, such as endoscopy and grease analysis, can only partially assess the pitch bearing conditions. Therefore, it is essential to develop effective in-situ condition assessment methods and tools in order to reduce high maintenance cost, unplanned downtime and risk of catastrophic failure, improve reliability and energy efficiency of onshore and offshore wind power generation and enable reliable decision making in ageing onshore wind turbine life extension.The ambitious research is, for the first time and at the international forefront, to develop intelligent pitch bearing condition assessment methods and in-situ tools using vibration and acoustic emission measurements. In particular, the research tackles the global grand challenges in wind industry by addressing the fundamentally technical challenges related to weak, noisy, and non-stationary data analysis for large slow speed bearings. This will be achieved by developing novel algorithms with sparse signal separation, data fusion and machine learning methods, followed by significant demonstration activities on both lab and real world operating environments. The PI has developed the first industrial-scale wind turbine pitch bearing platform including three naturally damaged bearings with over 15 years operating life in a real wind farm and advanced data collection instrument. The newly built platform lays a solid foundation for the proposed research and creates an ideal platform for carrying out demonstration and impact activities. The PI has also secured the unique opportunity to carry out field data collection and demonstration in real world operating wind farms under the strongest supports provided by two industrial project partners.The data collected from three naturally damaged bearings will be made publicly available under open-source licences to enable other researchers to carry out condition assessment for large slow speed bearings. The IP developed during the project will be protected. The developed algorithms will be made publicly available, if not conflicted with the IP.The successful outcome of this project will break new ground in in-situ pitch bearing condition assessment methods and tools, contribute to industrial standards of pitch bearings, and benefit a wide range of industries that use large slow speed bearings, such as offshore oil, gas, mining and steel making, over many decades of bearing service life. The novel methods with regard to weak, noisy and non-stationary data analysis can be used for wide data-driven applications. Therefore, the project has a significant, wide and long term impact in the next few decades.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,EP/S017224/1,,,,,,,,University of Manchester,,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:15310319,,,,,

Subsurface FADs were deployed along the shelf edge and inshore off St. Thomas. Off St. Croix, surface and subsurface FADs were placed along the shelf edge. Fishing success was evaluated by experimental trolling around FAD and control locations. Over 170 trolling trips comprising 447 fishing h were conducted between 1986 and 1990. Catch per boat hour ranged from 0.04 to 1.054 on the FADs and 0.07 to 0.305 on the controls. Trolling around FADs yielded a significantly greater number of fish and strikes than control areas except for the St. Croix subsurface FADs. Species diversity of catch also was significantly greater on the FADs compared to controls except for the St. Croix subsurface units. No significant differences in fishing success were found between the St. Thomas subsurface FADs and the St. Croix surface FADs. The St. Thomas subsurface FADs attracted more coastal pelagic species such as barracuda (Sphyraena barracuda), jacks (Carangidae) and king mackerel (Scomberomorous cavalla), while the St. Croix surface FADs attracted more oceanic pelagics such as tunas (Scombridae) and dolphin (Coryphaena hippurus).

The mooring system of TLP consists of number of tensioned tethers connected to the columns at the top and anchored to the seabed at the bottom. These tethers are vulnerable to failure due to extreme (maximum and minimum) tensions. The reliability study of these tethers is an important subject of study. The reliability may further deteriorate after the failure or removal of any of these tethers. In the present study, reliability analysis of an intact TLP and TLP with one tether missing has been carried out. A Von-Mises failure criterion has been adopted to define the failure of tether against maximum tension. The minimum tension failure occurs when the tethers slack due to loss of tension. The limit state functions for maximum and minimum tension cases have been derived. The computationally efficient algorithm First order reliability method (FORM) has been adopted for reliability calculations. Results are presented in terms of reliability indices and probabilities of failure for each sea state. The probabilities of failure so obtained for different sea states have been used for the assessment of annual and life time probability of failures. Reliability of the TLP with one tether missing has been compared with that of the corresponding intact TLP. Effect of wind has also been studied on the progressive failure of TLP tethers and the results have been compared with that of an intact TLP. (C) 2000 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.

Considering the wave-induced fatigue assessment for such structures, the combination of many environmental loading cases and the need of long time-series responses make the computational cost even more critical. In order to reduce the computational burden related to the wave-induced fatigue analysis of Steel Catenary Risers (SCRs), this work presents the application of a recently developed hybrid methodology that combines dynamic Finite Element Analysis (FEA) and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN). The methodology is named hybrid once it requires short time series of structure responses (obtained by FEA) and imposed motions (evaluated analytically) to train an ANN. Subsequently, the ANN is employed to predict the remaining response time series using the prescribed motions imposed at the top of the structure by the floater unit. In this particular work, the methodology is applied aiming to predict the tension and bending moments' time series at structural elements located at the top region and at the touchdown zone (TDZ) of a metallic riser. With the predicted responses (tensions and moments), the stress time series are determined for eight points along the pipe cross sections, and stress cycles arc identified using a Rainflow algorithm. Fatigue damage is then evaluated using SN curves and the Miner-Palmgren damage accumulation rule. The methodology is applied to a SCR connected to a semisubmersible platform in a water depth of 910 m. The obtained results are compared to those from a full FEA in order to evaluate the accuracy and computer efficiency of the hybrid methodology.",,,,,,,,,9,0,0,0,0,0,9,,,1024-123X,1563-5147,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Fed Rio de Janeiro, Lab Anal & Reliabil Offshore Struct, Civil Engn Program, COPPE, Rio De Janeiro, Brazil",,,,2018-08-15,WOS:000440902200001,,,,,

To evaluate the rate of degradation of wood by teredinids in two sites with different oceanographic conditions in Rio de Janeiro State, Brazil, artificial structures composed of pine wood sheets were immersed in the ocean for three months at Arraial do Cabo in an area under the influence of upwelling, and at Ilha Grande Bay under tropical and oligotrophic influences. After the immersion period, teredinids were removed from the collectors, identified, and counted. Wood consumption by the teredinids was quantified by comparing the dry weights of the collectors before and after immersion. Associated bacteria were isolated and their cellulolytic activities evaluated at different temperatures and salinities. Two Teredinidae species were recorded: Bankia gouldi and Lyrodus floridanus. The highest wood degradation rate and enzymatic activities of the isolated bacterial strains were recorded at Arraial do Cabo, suggesting that upwelling influenced the activities of those species.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2021-04-23,DRCI:DATA2021075021465044,,,,,

A large part of the power generated from renewable sources nowadays comes from wind, and this share is expected to grow even more in the coming years. Notwithstanding the considerable recent technological developments in wind energy that happened in the last years, there are still many open research questions in this field, mainly because industry is gradually moving to larger wind farms, with larger turbines, deployed at different locations (e.g. floating offshore) and posing new techno-economic challenges such as lifetime extension and more reliable power delivery to grid than previously. To help tackle these issues, much insight can be gained with the use of numerical modelling and simulation. Besides that, these numerical models can be employed as design tools for new equipment and installations.This research project intends to develop numerical models and high performance computing techniques beyond the state-of-the-art to support the sustainable exploitation of wind power. The activities of the project can be grouped in two different work streams. In the first one, we will investigate large scale phenomena and will employ the actuator disc/line approach to model the turbines. The main deliverables of this work stream will be highly-accurate numerical models to investigate wind turbine wake interactions and interference, wind farm layout optimization tools and strategies for optimal integrated control of wind farm turbines. In the second work stream, we will perform blade-resolved simulations using numerical models which take the flexibility of the structures into account. With these models, we will perform numerical simulations of large wind turbines, including floating offshore examples and will develop design tools for small scale wind turbines. This proposal will be considered as a match funding from FAPESP, as part of an already approved H2020 European Union grant on high performance computing (Proposal HPCWE, number SEP-210516159, call H2020-FETHPC-2018-2020).

In order to support investment decisions a systematic mathematical approach to the O&M cost contributions is required prior to detailed engineering or even construction of the wind farm.Adopting the general terms of efficiency, productivity and effectiveness defined for production processes we introduce the Wind Farm Process and its Total Overall Equipment Effectiveness (TotalOEE) by considering wind farms performing a transformation of produced electrical energy to delivered (sold) electrical energy. This transformation process consists of an installation, i.e. properly selected wind energy converters and their arrangement to form a wind farm, and of a process comprising operation and maintenance. Both are the subject of optimization to maximize the annual energy output by minimizing the different kinds of losses.In a systematic approach to the causes and nature of losses in wind farms the terms theoretical production time, available production time and valuable production time are redefined in unit full load hours. Then, a calculation scheme is developed to quantify wind farm production losses in terms of planned or unplanned downtimes and speed losses and to relate the associated reduction of revenues DeltaR to the theoretical maximum of annual wind park revenues R-theo(park). It leads to the simple equation DeltaR/R-theo = TotalOEE - 1 < 0. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Data from 36 of the squares with breeding Hen Harriers during the 2000 survey revealed a marginally non-significant negative relationship between wind farm presence and change in the number of breeding pairs between 2000 and 2010.Conclusions: A considerable overlap exists between Hen Harrier breeding distribution and the location of wind farms in Ireland, particularly in areas between 200 and 400m above sea level. The presence of wind farms is negatively related to Hen Harrier population trends in squares surveyed in 2000 and 2010, but this relationship is not statistically significant, and may not be causal.

J,,,,,,,,,Thomas Wilding,,Improving marine growth estimates using 3D photogrammetry,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Awarded Grant,Jan 01 2018,2018,"Offshore infrastructure, including oil and gas and renewables installations, are rapidly colonised by a diverse range of animals and plants (seaweeds), here referred to as 'marine growth'. The nature and extent of marine growth has both engineering and ecological consequences for the performance and integrity of offshore infrastructure. From an engineering perspective, marine growth changes critical structure characteristics affecting performance at both the operational (e.g. drag and loading forces) and decommissioning phases (e.g. jacket lifting/towing). From an ecological perspective, marine growth is the basis for the 'reef-effect' offered by offshore structures; marine growth provides ecosystem services such as water filtration, food provision and shelter (e.g. for commerical fish species). The scale of offshore energy, and the associated installation and removal of structures, is considerable and includes the commissioning of new wind-farms (up to 50,000 wind-turbines are projected by 2050 in Europe) and decommissioning of oil and gas structures (>20% of North Sea assets to be decommissioned within 10 years). Industry needs to monitor four aspects of the marine growth (MG) on their installations. These aspects are marine growth type (e.g. mussels, coral, anemones) mass, volume and surface roughness. Accurate estimation of these aspects is required in order to (1) inform engineering decisions that account for effects of marine growth, (2) optimise cleaning regimes and planning, (3) inform lifting operations at decommissioning and (4) organise disposal of the marine growth. Marine growth estimates are also required to understand the ecosystem-services offered by offshore structures and thus the environmental consequences of installing and removing infrastructure. This information is also required by regulators and policy-makers as an evidence base to optimise decision-making with respect to consenting offshore activities. Currently, industry employs a simple algorithm to estimate marine growth thickness and mass on their structures. This algorithm frequently results in substantial overestimates (up to a factor of 20) between predicted and reported MG mass. The current poor MG estimates result in a high degree of uncertainty, for example in the equipment necessary to lift a structure, and this uncertainty incurs considerable costs. Our project will build on on-going research to assess the feasibility of generating, and analysing, 3D images derived from video footage obtained using remotely operated vehicles (ROV). We will calibrate the MG volume estimated from the ROV-3D images against different MG categories (seaweed, hard-growth, such as mussels, and soft-growth, such as sponges and anemones). We will then take ROV footage gathered around oil and gas structures that have subsequently been decommissioning, and cleaned, and compare our new MG estimates against those recorded by the decommissioning yard. This feasibility assessment will culminate in the production of best-practice guidelines to industry for optimal methods to generate and use 3D images in assessing MG. The knowledge embedded in end-users organisations, as result of this project, will steer adoption of 3D imaging as a novel marine growth assessment tool.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,NE/R014698/1,,,,,,,,Scottish Association For Marine Science,Scottish Association For Marine Science,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:15342489,,,,,

The concept of Ecological Engineering , recently applied to marine biology, integrates ecology, economy and society's needs into the design of artificial marine structures. Recently, some ecological designs, such as the addition of pools, pits, and crevices, have been proposed in order to reduce habitat modification, diminish colonization by invasive species, and spread and maintain ecosystem functioning and biodiversity indexes that are more similar to those of the natural environment. Within the features that may increase artificial habitats' diversity, tidepools are unique habitats that reduce stress in the intertidal, favouring breeding and feeding, as well as providing shelter and a greater degree of moisture to a certain group of species, which may present an advantage for them. Nevertheless, the ecological benefits that arise from the inclusion of these features on fully mature artificial structures are still poorly known. In the present study, tidepools were created on artificial substrate with an affordable method (jackhammer) in the locality of Ceuta (Strait of Gibraltar). The pools were carved on dolomitic riprap at two different intertidal levels, high and low shore (+ 0.75 m and + 0.25 m higher than the lowest fide, respectively) with an average area of 195.2 cm(2) and 353.01 cm(3) of volume. These coastal defence structures were built more than eight years ago, thus the biota has substantially completed its colonization period and is set in terms of species composition. To test humidity effects on benthic assemblages around tidepools, the adjacent halo around the pool, with a width of 5 cm, was equally traced. Pool assemblages were compared to adjacent artificial and natural substrate and also to nearby natural pools. One year later, the results in species richness and diversity were significantly higher in the tidepools than the other two studied treatments (5 cm and control), artificial pools exceeded control species richness by 39.21% and control diversity by 30.70%. Focusing on the tidepool halo (5 cm) effect in the artificial substrate, the results show that the biological assemblages were different than tidepool and emerged rock, indicating that the newly created habitat extends its influence beyond the limits of the tidepools. Tidepools increased the number of species on ripraps and contributed to reduced fragmentation of some vagile species' populations, as they favoured settlement of species that previously seemed excluded from artificial substrate such as Pisania striata, Fisurella sp., Phorcus turbinatus and Lepidochitona sp. In the case of Siphonaria pectinata, it increased its presence in the tidepools and most of its egg masses were observed inside the pools. Finally, it should be mentioned that the pools have extended the upper vertical limits of infra-littoral level species such as Paracentrotus sp., mostly young individuals, and Aiptasia sp. These results may help to modify existing artificial shores to reduce their ecological impact.",,,,,,,,,17,0,0,0,12,0,17,,,0925-8574,1872-6992,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Seville, Fac Biol, LBM, Ave Reina Mercedes S-N, E-41012 Seville, SpainCNR, Ist Ambiente Marino Costiero Loc Sa Mardini, I-09072 Torregrande, OR, ItalyUniv Seville, Estn Biol Marina Estrecho, Juan Pablo 2 S-N, Ceuta 51001, Spain",,,,2018-09-01,WOS:000444614500056,,,,,

Support for environmental management options aimed at improving degraded harbours depends on understanding the factors which influence people's perceptions of harbour environments. We used an online survey, across 12 harbours, to assess sources of variation people's perceptions of harbour health and ecological engineering. We tested the hypotheses: 1) people living near impacted harbours would consider their environment to be more unhealthy and degraded, be more concerned about the environment and supportive of and willing to pay for ecological engineering relative to those living by less impacted harbours, and 2) people with greater connectedness to the harbour would be more concerned about and have greater perceived knowledge of the environment, and be more supportive of, knowledgeable about and willing to pay for ecological engineering, than those with less connectedness. Across twelve locations, the levels of degradation and modification by artificial structures were lower and the concern and knowledge about the environment and ecological engineering were greater in the six Australasian and American than the six European and Asian harbours surveyed. We found that people's perception of harbours as healthy or degraded, but not their concern for the environment, reflected the degree to which harbours were impacted. There was a positive relationship between the percentage of shoreline modified and the extent of support for and people's willingness to pay indirect costs for ecological engineering. At the individual level, measures of connectedness to the harbour environment were good predictors of concern for and perceived knowledge about the environment but not support for and perceived knowledge about ecological engineering. To make informed decisions, it is important that people are empowered with sufficient knowledge of the environmental issues facing their harbour and ecological engineering options.

In New Zealand, the green-lipped mussel, Perna canaliculus, has historically been cultivated at inshore locations, but increased competition for space has led the industry to develop offshore farming sites several kilometers from the coast. We hypothesize that the distance to these farm sites from coastal locations, and their placement over extensive soft-sediment habitats, may provide a barrier to colonization by biofouling species with limited natural dispersal abilities. A study of two offshore mussel farms revealed that they supported relatively impoverished biofouling communities by comparison with inshore mussel farms and other artificial structures. Offshore sites had a relatively low number of taxa and a low prevalence of short-dispersing organisms such as ascidians, which are a problematic group of fouling organisms in aquaculture. We suggest that newly established offshore marine farms have the potential to be kept free of a range of problematic fouling organisms, provided the introduction of such species via human transport pathways can be mitigated.",,,,,,,,,10,0,0,0,9,0,11,,,0893-8849,1749-7345,,,,,,,,,,"Cawthron Inst, Private Bag 2, Nelson 7010, New ZealandNatl Inst Water & Atmospher Res, POB 8602, Christchurch 8011, New Zealand",,,,2016-06-22,WOS:000377215000008,,,,,

Renewable energy will play a vital role in meeting this demand whilst maintaining global climate change targets. Around the British Isles, development of wind farms has entered Round three, with large, high capacity wind parks being planned to enhance energy security and achieve 2020 renewable energy targets. Such developments place additional pressure on existing sea space and may result in conflicts with other marine activities and users. Co-location of certain activities, marine protected areas, aquaculture and commercial fishing in particular, has therefore been proposed as an option to ease demands on space. Using the UK guided by EU and regional policy, as a case study, following the criteria-based planning system, co-location is legally feasible. Crucially, co-location options will depend on site specific characteristics and site management plans. The biology, ecology and hydrology of the site as well as consideration of important commercial and economic factors will be determining factors of success. For marine protected areas compatibility with conservation objectives for the site will be fundamental. Where possible, it is suggested that activities suitable for co-location will develop in tandem with renewable energy projects. The importance of developing joint projects in this manner is particularly true for aquaculture projects to ensure tenure security and commercial viability. Adaptive management will be a basis for evolution of the concept and practice of co-location. Pilot projects and continued monitoring will be essential in shaping the future of co-location of activities. As the Marine Management Organisation continues the development of marine plans for the English inshore and offshore waters, a study into potential solutions for resolving sea use conflicts is timely. This paper therefore provides a concise overview of the current regulation affecting co-location of key marine activities within wind farm zones and provides suggestions on how co-location projects can be adopted and taken forward, using the UK as a case study.

After the test started, the sand particles near the downstream mudline began to oscillate periodically, probably due to the distribution pattern of the seepage hydraulic gradient under the pipeline as well as asymmetric waves. As the wave height gradually increased, the sand under the pipeline began to oscillate at increasing amplitude and the coverage of oscillation extended upstream. Some sand rushed out from the bottom of the pipeline, and the sand oscillated almost symmetrically around the bottom line of the pipeline thereafter. The oscillation amplitude of the sand particles continued to rise, probably due to a decrease in the seepage path under the pipeline and loosened sediment in the oscillation.

The visualization results reproduced the delay in the scour onset reported previously, and related the delay to the aforementioned increase in sediment oscillation amplitude.

We selected a fringing reef along the lagoon of Dahab (Sinai, Egypt) as a model for a management strategy. Point-intercept line transects were used to determine substrate composition, coral community and condition, and the coral damage index (CDI) was applied. Approximately 84% of the coral colonies showed signs of damage such as breakage, partial mortality or algal overgrowth, especially affecting the most frequent coral genus Acropora. Questionnaires were used to determine the visitors' socio-economic background and personal attitudes regarding snorkelling. SCUBA-diving and interest in visiting a prospective snorkelling trail. Experiencing nature (97%) was by far the strongest motivation, and interest in further education about reef ecology and skill training - was high. Less experienced snorkellers and divers - the target group for further education and skill training were those most prepared to financially support such a trail. We therefore recommend a guided underwater snorkelling trail and restricting recreational use to a less sensitive 'ecotourism zone' while protecting the shallow reef flat. Artificial structures can complete the trail and offer the opportunity to snorkel over deeper areas at unfavourable tide or wind conditions. This approach provides a strategy for the management and conservation of shallow-water reefs, which are facing increasing human impact here and elsewhere. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

In the UK, some of the oldest platforms have been in the water for over 40 years and have considerable colonisation of marine organisms. Marine Growth organisms generally include seaweeds, soft corals and mussels in the areas where light penetrates(photic zone) as well as anemones, hydroids and cold-water corals on the deeper sections of the platforms. One of the first marine growth studies published was on the Montrose platform back in 1982; and significant discoveries have been made during offshore installation marine growth assessments since then, such as the first discovery of the CITES Listed Lophelia pertusa coral growing on offshore platforms during the decommissioning of the Brent Spar storage buoy, the with results subsequently being published in Nature in 1999. L. pertusa as since been recorded on the majority of northern North Sea platforms - and therefore their presence on the structures may be contributing to the connectivity of the protect reefs in the UK and Norway.Marine growth causes issues for the oil and gas industry (operators) by adding additional weight to the structure which may cause damage and impair visual inspection of important equipment, both in routine and decommissioning scenarios. New areas of interest have also developed around platform marine growth, including the potential for marine invasive species, potential stepping stone habitats, artificial reefs for conservation (e.g. de-facto MPAs) or fish using the structures for food and shelter. In areas of the Gulf of Mexico, a rigs-to-reef programme, (the conversion of offshore platforms into designated artificial reefs) is underway. However, in Europe, particularly in the North East Atlantic OSPAR region, there is a requirement to remove all offshore infrastructures from the seabed (although derogations may be granted). As part of the decommissioning plan, an operator may be required to assess the extent of marine growth on a platform to determine the additional weight added to the platform (for structure removal) or for potential organic waste disposal and especially if species of conservation importance (e.g. Lophelia and Sabellaria) are present. This project will use a pre-devolved method (CoralNet) to analysis images of marine growth on offshore structures. The method will allow for more images to be analysed, compared to traditional assessment methodology and will allow for a more consistent approach, potentially providing for a good long-term monitoring tool. In addition, finding new and innovative monitoring methods, is not only about collecting data in the field, but also about how the data should be analysed, with this project will contribute.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,NE/N019865/1,,,,,,,,University of Aberdeen,,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:15341693,,,,,

In addition, coupled nonlinear effects of risers and mooring cables connected to the vessel can lead to unexpected responses, thus justifying the significance of modeling these nonlinear coupled effects for safer and cost-effective design and operation of offshore structures. In this study, a fully coupled multi-field fluid-structure-interaction (FSI) solver is developed to simulate the wave- and flow-induced vibration of the flexible multibody system with constraints (viz., vessel-riser system) in a turbulent flow. The structural domain with multibody systems is solved using nonlinear co-rotational finite element method, whereas the fluid domain is solved using Petrov-Galerkin finite element method for moving boundary Navier-Stokes solutions. A partitioned iterative scheme based on non-linear interface force corrections is employed for coupling of the turbulent fluid-flexible multibody system with non-matching interface meshes. Delayed Detached Eddy Simulation (DDES) via the Positivity Preserving Variational (PPV) method is employed for modeling turbulence effects at high Reynolds number. The free-surface ocean waves are modeled by the Allen-Cahn based phase-field method. We address two key challenges in the present variational coupled formulation. Firstly, the coupling of the incompressible turbulent flow with a system of nonlinear elastic bodies described in a co-rotated frame. Secondly, the two-phase coupling based on the phase-field approach to model the air-water interface. We then present the dynamics of coupled vessel-riser system studied in harsh environmental conditions with a view of developing a robust station keeping system.

In this perspective, the governments world-wide are mobilizing initiatives to exploit renewable energy sources to mitigate increasing demand of energy, volatile fuel prices, and environmental concerns. Renewable energy (wind/solar) based power system is a nature-friendly option for power production to foster sustainable development challenges. In the present study, the economic feasibility of development of 75 MW wind power plants (wind farms) in the coastal locations of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (K.S.A.) has been studied/reviewed by analyzing long-term wind speed data. Attention has been focused on four coastal locations (Al-Wajh, Jeddah, Yanbu and Jizan) covering the west coast. In general, long-term data indicates that the yearly average wind speed of K.S.A. varies from 3.0 to 4.5 m/s at 10 m height. The wind farms simulated consist of different combinations of 600 kW commercial wind machines (50 m hub-height). NREL's (HOMER Energy's) HOMER software has been employed to perform the techno-economic assessment.The study presents monthly variations of wind speed, cumulative frequency distribution (CFD) profiles of wind speed, monthly and yearly amount of energy generated from the 75 MW wind farms (50 m hub-height) at different coastal locations of K.S.A., cost of generating energy (COE, $/kWh), capacity factor (%), etc. The CFD indicates that the wind speeds are less than 3 m/s for 45%, 53%, 41%, and 52% of the time during the year at Al-Wajh, Jeddah, Yanbu and Jizan respectively. This implies that wind electric conversion systems (WECS) will not produce energy for about 41-53% of the time during the year. The annual energy produced by 75 MW wind farms (50 m hub-height) has been found to be 107,196, 81,648, 135,822, and 80,896 MWh at Al-Wajh, Jeddah, Yanbu and Jizan respectively. The cost of wind-based electricity by using 600 kW (50 m hub-height) commercial WECS has been found to be 0.0536, 0.0704, 0.0423, and 0.0711 US$/kWh for Al-Wajh, Jeddah, Yanbu and Jizan respectively. Also, attempt has been made to determine the capacity factor (CF) of wind-based power plants, the CF has been found to vary from 12% to 21% for different locations of the Kingdom.

The harsh environmental conditions often lead to failure of these structures well before their design life period resulting in fatal accidents. To minimize VIV, several investigations were conducted by other researchers. The present study focuses on the experimental investigations of an elastically mounted circular cylinder shrouded with net substructure called as Ventilated Net (VN) to suppress VIV. The VN is an omnidirectional, economical, customizable net substructure comprising of flexible hollow tubes in a systematic arrangement. This device could be retrofitted to the offshore structures/risers, to attenuate VIV, thereby preventing the structure from fatigue failure. Experimental investigations are conducted to address the reduction of VIV and drag forces acting on the oscillating cylinder shrouded with VN of various configurations. The experiments are performed in towing tank facility in Department of Ocean Engineering, IIT Madras, India. The primary objective of the present investigation is to quantify the VIV amplitudes by employing VN shrouding the cylinder, at high Re regime, ranging from (0.22-2.50) x 10(5). The effect of spaces between the flexible hollow tubes and shrouding radii of VN around the cylinder are also addressed in this article. From the measurements, it is observed that cylinder with VN of dense mesh at a radial spacing of twice the diameter of the bare cylinder, suppresses VIV by 98% and drag force by 40% at Re of 1.2 x 10(5).

We conducted studies of the three species of concern and a fourth introduced tunicate, Botrylloides violaceus, that occur on these structures to evaluate their effects on mussels and native invertebrate communities. Because most studies of community effects of tunicates have dealt with sessile fouling organisms, we focused instead on epibenthic organisms such as meiofaunal harpacticoid copepods and macrofaunal polychaetes and amphipods that are known to be important prey for juvenile salmon and other small fish. Similar studies have shown mixed results, with negative, positive, or no effects depending on the species. We also found few community-level effects. Abundances of several species were lower when tunicates were present, but only at some of the sites. Several other species, including a non-native isopod, were significantly more abundant in the presence of tunicates. However, in most cases results were not statistically significant and more intensive, controlled sampling or experiments may be needed to demonstrate any consistent tunicate effects.

In shallow water, a wind turbine is typically embedded into the ocean floor while, in deep-water, a wind turbine can be installed on a floating island. In both instances excessive wave loading can result in catastrophic failure. An understanding of wave mechanics is, thus, necessary for the development of offshore wind sites. Similarly, shoreline wave-energy devices experience fluctuating loads due to the complex wave formations caused by coastal obstacles as well as variations in coastal depth. An understanding of wave mechanics is, thus, also necessary to maximise the energy output and life expectancy of a wave-energy device.Although the governing equations which dictate the mechanics of ocean waves are inherently nonlinear, previous research has shown that wave evolution typically occurs in a linear fashion up until the point of breaking. Linear approximations of the governing equations have been used by engineers to estimate the loads experienced by offshore structures and such approximates have proven reliable in estimating the ling-term time-averaged statistics of ocean waves. However, more recent research indicates that the nonlinearity of the governing equations can result in short-term transient events which deviate significantly from the long-term time-averaged statistics, In the vernacular, such events are termed rogue or freak waves, which represent a significant risk to offshore structures. The formation of extreme waves can be mitigated by the phenomenon of wave breaking. However, the process of wave breaking is itself nonlinear. Weakly non-linear approximates of governing equations have, thus, been developed for the analysis of nonlinear wave mechanics. However, the nonlinear mechanisms involved in the formation and breaking of extreme waves have not been conclusively determined. The fidelity of the weakly nonlinear approach, thus, remains unproven.This project seeks to identify nonlinear mechanisms which could cause extreme wave events, including ocean currents, in deep waters, as well as seabed topology, in shallow waters. The fidelity of the weakly nonlinear approach shall then be assessed by direct comparison with numerical simulations of the fully nonlinear potential flow equations, in collaboration with HR Wallingford, Oxford, and the Technical University of Denmark (DTU). Although experimental wave-tank facilities are not available at Oxford University, experimental validation of the results may also be performed with partner laboratories in the United Kingdom, at Plymouth University, and China, at Shanghai Jiao Tong University, with complimentary field data from a variety of ocean sites.Ultimately, this project aims to provide insight into a crucial sustainability topic by advancing the state-of-the-art in the analysis of nonlinear wave mechanics.

During their lifetime cycle, the foundation is suspended to complex loading conditions due to waves, tidal currents and wind loads and its resistance has to be known. At the end of the lifetime cycle, the anchor plates have to be removed from the seabed. The extraction resistance of the anchors is thereby a lot higher than the sum of its self-weight and hydrostatic and earth pressure. When the anchor plate is moved, the volume underneath increases. This leads to a suction until inflowing pore water fills the newly created volume. In order to investigate this effect, an experimental study at model scale with a displacement-driven extraction is performed. Pore pressure measurements are carried out at various locations in the soil body and underneath the plate. The soil movement is tracked with the particle image velocimetry method (PIV). In the conducted experiments different extraction velocities are considered to investigate its effect on the extraction resistance.

Karpathos and Kasos are two small islands, located in the South-East Aegean Sea (Dodecanese complex) that are not connected to the main power distribution network. Energy production is based exclusively on an autonomous thermal power plant and a small wind park, installed on the island of Karpathos. The maximum annual power demand has been estimated to exceed 12 MW by 2014. The mean specific annual energy production cost from the existing system has been calculated at 0.249 epsilon/kW h in 2008.The proposed system aims at the maximisation of wind energy penetration and the minimisation of imported fossil fuel use for the production of electricity.The proposed system consists of a wind park and a pumped storage system (PSS). The introduced power system aims to guarantee power production for certain hours per day. A thorough sitting of the system is accomplished. Three different sites for the PSS installation are examined before the optimum is selected. The available wind potential of the islands was evaluated using a wind mast installed within the frame of the examined project's feasibility study. The annual mean wind velocity at the wind park's installation site was measured to be higher than 11.5 m/s.The introduced system's set-up, and operation & maintenance cost parameters have been estimated. The dimensioning of the system aims mainly at optimising the project's economic indexes, following the existing legislative framework. The annual guaranteed energy production has also been maximised.An economic sensitivity analysis is performed. It is estimated that the proposed project can exhibit attractive economic indexes, regardless of the availability of a subsidy, on the condition that the selling price of energy should be configured at 0.3552 epsilon/kW h and the selling price of guaranteed power should be 127 epsilon/kW year.Under the above mentioned prerequisites, the project payback period is estimated at 5-6 years.The present paper proves the economic feasibility of small scale wind powered pumped storage systems, not taking into account the undoubted environmental benefits.

Arguably, the largest impact will be upon the fishing industry where access loss may lead to displacement and reduced catch per unit effort in turn leading to conflict. To prevent conflict, it is important to understand mitigating factors. Marine renewable energy devices (MREDs) and associated infrastructure will be placed on the seabed, affecting benthic infauna and epifauna, important sources of food for many species including those of commercial importance, potentially providing benefits to the fishing industry and mitigating the causes of conflict. Two key plausible benefits of MREDs are the 'artificial reef effect' and the 'exclusion zone effect'. This study investigated the utility of the Ecopath with Ecosim and Ecospace modelling software to address the implications of these 'effects'. Two case study models were developed, one at the whole west coast of Scotland shelf scale and one at a smaller single installation scale. Our results suggested that the Ecospace model could potentially predict the effects of MRED installations, but revealed that there are a number of considerations which should be taken into account before attempting to do this. Key considerations include data availability (an issue in all modelling), spatial scale and resolution. Other limitations to this particular study such as the ability to make changes over time are currently being addressed by ongoing developments of the software. Despite the considerations and limitations, these case studies reveal the usefulness of spatial ecosystem modelling, particularly Ecospace, to investigate this issue. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

As the development and urbanisation of estuaries continues at an increasing rate worldwide, these environments are being simultaneously affected by these threats. This study quantifies the spread of an invasive reef-building polychaete, Ficopomatus enigmaticus, in a small, highly manipulated urban estuary in South Africa and investigates its role as an ecosystem engineer. Anthropogenic changes to the Zandvlei Estuary, including construction of a rubble weir and canalisation near the estuary mouth, construction of an extensive marina development and hardening of the banks with concrete, have facilitated the expansion of E enigmaticus. The standing stock of E enigmaticus increased from 13.69 t, as measured in 1986, to 50.03 t in 2012, due both to increase in the total area colonised and standing stock per m(2). Since E enigmaticus reefs support a greater biomass of infauna than adjacent sandy areas, total invertebrate biomass in the estuary is estimated to have increased from less than 0.30 t in 1942, to over 56.80 t in 2012, due mainly to hardening of banks in parts of the main estuary with concrete and construction of a marina system. A positive correlation between reef mass and infaunal biomass, density and diversity was also found. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Most real world design evaluation and risk-based decision support combine quantitative and qualitative (linguistic) variables. Decision making based on conventional mathematics that combines qualitative and quantitative concepts always exhibits difficulty in the modelling of actual problems. The successful selection process for choosing a design/procurement proposal is based on a high degree of technical integrity, safety levels and low costs in construction, corrective measures, maintenance, operation, inspection, as well as preventive measures. However, the objectives of maximizing the degree of technical performance, maximizing the safety levels and minimizing the costs incurred are usually in conflict, and the evaluation of the technical performance, safety and costs is always associated with uncertainty, especially for a novel system at the initial concept design stage. In this paper, a design-decision support framework using a composite structure methodology grounded in an approximate reasoning approach and an evidential reasoning method is suggested for design evaluation of offshore engineering products at the initial stages. It is a multiple attribute decision-making (MADM) or multiple-criteria decision-making framework, which provides a juxtaposition of cost, safety, and technical performance and other objectives of a system during evaluation to assist decision makers in selecting the winning design/procurement proposal that best satisfies the requirement in hand. It has also been shown that the formal decision-making techniques such as the Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) and the Delphi method can be incorporated with the proposed framework in carrying out design support evaluation.

Artificial habitats are a common feature of urban marine environments and usually support different assemblages of marine organisms in contrast to neighbouring natural habitats. Despite these differences, artificial habitats can be managed to benefit biodiversity, either by the addition of structures to provide habitat where little natural habitat remains, or by engineering existing structures to better support native populations.2. Seahorses are listed as protected species in New South Wales, Australia, and are of conservation concern worldwide. The physical structure of nets used to protect popular swimming beaches in a highly urbanized estuary, Sydney Harbour, was manipulated to test the hypotheses that more structurally complex habitats would support higher abundances of the seahorse Hippocampus whitei that use these structures and their potential prey (mobile crustaceans).3. The simple addition of frayed net material to construct a more structurally complex net habitat supported higher abundances of H. whitei than unmanipulated nets in a field experiment over 53 days. Habitat preference assays in the laboratory supported the hypothesis that the patterns of distribution observed in the field were due to the preferences of individual seahorses for the more complex habitats.4. The habitats manipulated to add structural complexity supported much higher abundances of the mobile epifauna (amphipods, copepods) that are consumed by seahorses. The potential therefore exists to engineer artificial structures in urban estuaries to provide habitats that are preferred by vulnerable fauna and their food sources.

The life-cycle cost (LCC) was estimated for a range of characteristic environmental loads. An iterative design optimization procedure was employed to find the target reliability at which the LCC was minimized. The structural system was designed for a given set of environmental loads caused by waves, currents, and winds. Extreme environmental conditions were estimated by a probabilistic model. The relationship between the characteristic load and the structural reliability was considered on the basis of the selected probabilistic model to study the variation of the LCC for the given set of environmental loads. The set of LCCs, which were the sum of the capital expenditure (CAPEX), operating expenditure (OPEX), and risk expenditure (RISKEX), were estimated to determine the optimal reliability. A case study was conducted for a pile-guide system (PGS) as a novel offshore installation. The PGS was designed to keep the position of large-scale floating installations. The system consists of guide piles supporting the floating installation, a subsea truss structure cross-linking the piles, and a seabed base platform fixed to the seabed. Two target locations near Busan city were considered to study the change of optimal reliability with respect to the same structural system. Finally, the optimal reliabilities at the two target locations were determined with the minimum LCC. The optimal reliability could vary depending on the types of structures, the economic roles of the system, and the environmental conditions at various locations. Thus, in contrast to the prescriptive strategy, the proposed procedure for determining the optimal design load and reliability would be meaningful and applicable to design of offshore structures.

The EU-funded DEVOTES project (DEVelopment Of innovative Tools for understanding marine biodiversity and assessing good Environmental Status) aims to better understand the relationships between pressures from human activities and climatic influences and their effects on marine ecosystems. To achieve these goals, it is necessary among others, to test and validate innovative monitoring tools to improve our understanding of ecosystem and biodiversity changes. This paper outlines the application of a high frequency non-invasive (HFNI) valvometer as a potential tool for long-term marine monitoring and assessments. The principle of the method is based on the regular gaping behavior (closing and opening of the valves) of bivalve molluscs and the fact that physical or chemical stressors disrupt that gaping reference pattern. Bivalve gaping behavior is monitored in the natural environment, remotely, continuously over a time period of years, requirements that must be fulfilled if bivalve behavior is to be a useful biomonitoring tool. Here, we review the literature and highlight potential uses of the HFNI valvometry as a biosensor, to monitor and provide early-warning alerts of changes in water quality, such as global temperature increase, releases of contaminants and toxic algal blooms. Finally, potential relevant applications for monitoring and assessing environmental status of marine waters in the context of the Marine Strategy Framework Directive are identified.

Malaysian offshore regions are subjected to significant water current. From the literature review carried out, it was found that the current would change the behavior of the sea waves. This is contributing significantly to the environmental loading and affect the dynamic responses of the offshore structures. Hence, the study that focused on the effects of the current together with the wave on the structural dynamic response is necessary. In this study, the effect of the current coexisting with the wave on the dynamic responses of a truss spar model was experimentally investigated and quantified. The model tests were performed in the wave tank of the Offshore Laboratory in Universiti Teknologi PETRONAS with a scaling factor of 1:100. Two sets of environmental conditions were considered in the model tests i.e. wave only and wave-current condition. The dynamic responses of the truss spar model subjected to these conditions were measured. In order to quantify the effect of current, the measured results for the condition with and without current were compared among and presented here. From this investigation, it was found that the existence of the current in the water body has increased the truss spar motions, whereby the higher current velocity, give the higher response.",,,,,"35th ASME International Conference on Ocean, Offshore and Arctic Engineering (OMAE)35th ASME International Conference on Ocean, Offshore and Arctic Engineering (OMAE)","JUN 19-24, 2016JUN 19-24, 2016","Amer Soc Mech Engineers, Ocean Offshore & Arctic Engn Div; Amer Soc Mech EngineersAmer Soc Mech Engineers, Ocean Offshore & Arctic Engn Div; Amer Soc Mech Engineers","Busan, SOUTH KOREABusan, SOUTH KOREA",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,978-0-7918-4992-7,,,,,,,,,"Univ Teknol PETRONAS, Tronoh, Perak, Malaysia",,,,2017-03-01,WOS:000393090000005,,,,,

The majority of these defences lack optimal habitats for intertidal species, resulting in low diversity and abundance. The construction of coastal defences within marine protected areas (MPA) is also increasing and this study investigates ways to limit the loss of species diversity and intertidal habitat caused by installing rock armour defence structures and other coastal developments. Arrays of holes and grooves were created on granite rock armour in the north of England at Runswick Bay, N. Yorkshire and limestone rock groynes in southern England at Boscombe, Poole Bay, Dorset. Runswick Bay is a Marine Conservation Zone (MCZ) designated for its intertidal habitat and Boscombe is located in close proximity to a Special Area of Conservation (SAC). After 12 months, the treatments had attracted new species to the defence structures and increased the overall diversity and abundance of organisms compared to control areas. Mobile fauna including crabs and fish were also recorded utilising the holes and grooves at Boscombe. Non-native species were recorded in grooves at one site however their abundance was not significantly different to that of control areas. At the southern site, species known to be spreading in response to climate change were found in treatments but not in control areas. The cost of the installation of these enhancement techniques was low in relation to that of the defence scheme and could be easily incorporated before, during or after construction. Through evaluation of the use of these ecological enhancement techniques on coastal structures, it is suggested that they have considerable potential to increase biodiversity on artificial structures, particularly when used within large-scale coastal engineering defence projects.",,,,,,,,,36,1,0,0,27,0,38,,,0272-7714,1096-0015,,,,,,,,,,"Bournemouth Univ, Fac Sci & Technol, Dept Life & Environm Sci, Talbot Campus, Poole BH12 5BB, Dorset, EnglandUniv Hull, Sch Environm Sci, Cottingham Rd, Kingston Upon Hull HU6 7RX, N Humberside, England",,,,2018-12-28,WOS:000439740000008,,,,,

Of particular interest are the massive accumulations of rubble formed by shear or compression in the ice cover, which consolidate to form sea ice ridges that can be hazards to such structures. These are common ice features in Arctic and sub Arctic environments and as a result often govern the design loads for ships, coastal and offshore structures operating in these environments. In addition, ridge keels can scour the seafloor in relatively shallow waters posing a threat to pipelines and other subsea facilities. It is not clear what load an ice rubble feature can exert on a given structure and how it will deform. It will depend on a number of parameters including the age of the feature, its composition and structure, and its strength and failure behaviour. This paper will examine the mechanical properties of ice rubble over multiple scales. The paper will begin at the one block level, describing how ice block properties vary over time, before advancing to look at the bonding/sintering processes that occur between two ice blocks and eventually the processes that take place between multiple ice blocks (i.e., ice rubble) and large scale sea ice ridges.

Multibeam bathymetry data show concentric 'halos of holes' extending hundreds of meters around the wrecks. These halos at 5 wreck sites between 16 and 111 yr old consist of hundreds of tightly spaced depressions with diameters of up to 10 m. Seafloor imagery clearly indicates a biogenic origin of the holes. The halos of the 2 youngest wrecks (<25 yr) have fewer holes than older wrecks, suggesting a relationship between wreck age and excavation activity. Conversely, the size of a wreck does not appear to control the sediment turnover activity. Holes are comparatively long-lived, and some of them are actively maintained by bioturbation activity. The spatial distribution of holes is consistent with resource depletion by a central-place forager, albeit on yearly to decadal time scales. Tow-camera data show that some holes support diverse sessile faunal assemblages of sponges, soft corals, and hard corals in an otherwise flat seafloor devoid of sessile fauna. The (to date unknown) bioturbator(s) are thus allogenic habitat engineers. The systematic occurrence of halos around wrecks suggests that 'the ecosystem wreck' extends beyond the spatial confines of the hull of a wreck to the seafloor, by a distance 10-fold greater than the size of a wreck itself.

The aim of this paper is to investigate CA effects in low-cost camera systems (several GoPro cameras) operated in an underwater environment. We found that underwater and in-air distortion profiles differed by more than 1000 times in terms of maximum displacement and in terms of curvature. Moreover, significant CA effects were found in the underwater profiles that did not exist in-air. Furthermore, the paper investigates the effect of adjustment constraints imposed on the underwater self-calibration and the reliability of the interior orientation parameters. The analysis of the precision shows that in-air RMS values are just due to random errors. In contrast, the underwater calibration RMS values are 3x-6x higher than the exterior orientation parameter (EOP) precision, so these values contain both random error and the systematic effects from the CA.

Recently the race for space in heavily used areas such as the North Sea triggered the proposal of co-locating other activities such as aquaculture or fisheries with passive gears in offshore wind farms (OWFs). Our interdisciplinary approach combined a quantification of spatial overlap of activities by using Vessel Monitoring System and logbook data with a stakeholder consultation to conclude and verify on the actual feasibility of co-location. In the German Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) of the North Sea up to 90% of Danish and 40% of German annual gilinet fleet landings of plaice overlapped with areas where OWFs are developed. Our results indicated further that the international gilinet fishery could lose up to 50% in landings within the North Sea German EEZ when OWF areas are closed entirely for fisheries. No spatial overlap was found for UK potters targeting brown crab in the German EEZ. We further identified a number of key issues and obstacles that to date hinder an actual implementation of co-location as a measure in the marine spatial planning process: defining the legal base; implementation of safety regulations; delineation of minimum requirements for fishing vessels such as capacities, quotas, technical equipment; implementation of a licensing process; and scoping for financial subsidies to set up business. The stakeholder consultation verified the scientific findings and highlighted that all those points need to be addressed in a planning process. In the German EEZ we have shown that the socioeconomic importance of spatial overlap varies within planning boundaries. Therefore we recommend an interdisciplinary bottom-up approach when scoping for suitable areas of co-location. Hence, an informed marine spatial planning process requires comprehensive and spatial explicit socio-economic viability studies factoring in also ecological effects of OWFs on target species.

The award to Prairie View A&M University has potential broader and societal impact in a number of areas. Floating offshore wind turbines (FOWTs) have been considered as one of the most promising alternatives to access energy resources with vast available space and fewer restrictions and regulations. The project seeks to analyze floating offshore wind turbine uncertainties that arise due to the ocean environment and hydrodynamic calculations, as well as due to uncertainties in the structural and mechanical systems, which threaten the reliability and the feasibility of FOWTs. Undergraduate students, high school students and students from community colleges will gain research experiences through this project. The current floating offshore wind turbine technologies have challenges to be resolved in order to produce sustainable and cost-effective power. Semi-submersible type FOWTs are known to be one of the most promising options with construction and maintenance cost problems yet to be solved. This project focuses on identification of the uncertainties and on estimating the structural safety factors. The research objectives of this project are to: understand the uncertainties that exist in FOWTs; predict the structural behavior and life-cycle structural reliability of FOWTs; and obtain safety factors for structural design of semi-submersible-type FOWTs that uniquely consider the uncertainties and coupled dynamics of aerodynamics of the wind turbine and hydrodynamics of the floating body under extreme environmental loads. By considering the uncertainties found, the probabilistic capacity and demand models for structural components of FOWTs will be developed using a Bayesian Method. Lastly, the developed models will be used to estimate the life-cycle structural reliability and to obtain the safety factors for the base tower moment and shear forces of FOWTs. The results of this research may eventually reduce the current challenge of the high cost of FOWTs.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,1700406,,,,,,,,Prairie View A & M University,,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:13548464,,,,,

To address this issue and to better understand how cleaning efforts can be directed, a model was created to relate the growth of these fouling communities with different environmental variables.

They will become more widespread over the next 10-30 years in response to rising and stormier seas and accelerating economic development of the coastal zone. Building coastal defences results in the loss and fragmentation of sedimentary habitats and their replacement by artificial rocky habitats that become colonised by algae and marine animals. The engineering design and construction of these structures have received considerable attention. However, the ecological consequences of coastal defences have been less extensively investigated. Furthermore, due to their rapid proliferation, there is a growing need to understand the role of these man-made habitats in the coastal ecosystems in order to implement impact minimisation and/or mitigation measures.As part of the DELOS project, targeted studies were carried out throughout Europe to assess the ecological similarity of low-crested coastal defence structures (LCS) to natural rocky shores and to investigate the influence of LCS design features on the colonising marine epibiota. LCSs can be considered as a relatively poor surrogate of natural rocky shores. Epibiotic communities were qualitatively similar to those on natural rocky shores as both habitats are regulated by the same physical and biological factors. However, there were quantitative differences in the diversity and abundance of epibiota on artificial structures. Typically, epibiotic assemblages were less diverse than rocky shore communities. Also, LCSs offered less structurally complex habitats for colonisation and in some locations experienced higher disturbance than natural shores. We propose several criteria that can be integrated into the design and construction of LCSs to minimise ecological impacts and allow targeted management of diversity and natural living resources.

With this aim, simulations from 12 Regional Climate Models from North America Coordinated Regional Climate Downscalling Experiment were used after proving its reliability by comparing the wind speed from simulations with in-situ data. A decrease of the offshore wind energy resource is projected along the 21st century in the United States, especially in the east coast. The central west coast is the only exception to this decrease trend during the near and mid future. In addition, the offshore wind energy resource was classified following a Delphi approach and considering three factors: wind energy, environmental risk and costs. Under this classification, most of the area under scope in both coasts was classified at least as a 4, which is considered as good resource. A higher wind energy resource was found for the west coast, with vast coastal areas categorized as 5 (excellent). A slight decrease was projected on the United States east coast, mainly caused by a reduction in the indices related to the mean wind speed and the stability of the resource throughout the year.",,,,,,,,,64,6,0,0,3,0,70,,,0306-2619,1872-9118,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Santiago de Compostela, CRETUS Inst, Dept Particle Phys, Grp Nonlinear Phys, Santiago De Compostela, SpainUniv Vigo, Sci Fac, Environm PHYS Lab EPHYSLAB, Orense 32004, SpainNASA, GMAO, Goddard Space Flight Ctr, Greenbelt, MD 20771 USAUniv Space Res Assoc, Goddard Earth Sci Technol & Res GESTAR, Columbia, MD 20771 USA",,,,2020-03-25,WOS:000517398200080,,,,,

This is mostly because of their superior axial load carrying performance, low resistance against fluid loads and easy handling during construction and transportation. Cylindrical structural members, however, very often happen to become subject to accidental lateral damages which are detrimental to their load carrying performance. Collision between supply ships and legs and bracings of offshore oil platforms, impact from heavy dropped objects on these members or denting during installation of marine structures are examples of such accidents. Prior to an accident, cylindrical members are usually carrying their normal operational loads. It is very important to include the effects of this service load (pre-loading) in evaluation of the behaviour of impacted member. The pre-loading may change the dynamic characteristics of the member or degrade its load carrying capacity. While the performance of cylindrical members subjected to lateral impact has been extensively researched, few studies can be found on the impact behaviour of pre-loaded tubular members. This paper reports results from a numerical study on axial pre-loading effects on the dynamic and quasistatic behaviour of cylindrical shells subjected to transverse impact loads.

The elements of a standard abrasive cutting contract are presented and the total cost of a job is derived based on the parameters of the contract. The total cost to perform a severance operation is aggregated according to job type and normalized according to the number, size, and length of cut performed. Descriptive statistics are provided based on data collected over a three-year period from 2000-2002, and relations are derived that estimate the time and cost of a cutting operation based on various descriptor variables. A major conclusion of the analysis is that abrasive cutting is a structure-independent operation, or in other words, the total cost of performing the service does not depend on the characteristics of the structure and can only be predicted after the job is finished and the on-site time of the cutting crew is known. This is in sharp contrast to explosive cutting, where structural characteristics are very good indicators of job cost.",,,,,,,,,3,1,0,0,0,0,3,,,0733-9364,,,,,,,,,,,"Louisiana State Univ, Ctr Energy Studies, Baton Rouge, LA 70803 USATwachtman Synder & Byrd Inc, Houston, TX 77040 USA",Twachtman Synder & Byrd Inc,,,2005-01-01,WOS:000225896800015,,,,,

Current standardization efforts make extensive use of single edge notch tension (or SENT) specimen to reduce the level of conservatism during the assessment. A great effort has been made to evaluate CTOD as a mean to assess fracture toughness, especially for offshore structures. The double clip gage method (DCGM) is an alternative CTOD test method, which produces less conservative values comparing with J-integral conversion into CTOD. In this paper, a novel CTOD definition is developed according to the philosophy of the DCGM, but requiring a single clip gauge and providing values similar to the J-integral converted CTOD.

Despite their popularity, few studies have rigorously examined fish assemblages on these structures and compared them to natural reefs. Six vessel-reefs off the coast of southeast Florida were censused quarterly (two ships per month) to characterize their associated fish assemblages. SCUBA divers used a nondestructive point-count method to visually assess the fish assemblages over 13- and 12-month intervals (March 2000 to March 2001 and March 2002 to February 2003). During the same intervals, fish assemblages at neighboring natural reefs were also censused. A total of 114,252 fishes of 177 species was counted on natural and vessel-reefs combined. Mean fish abundance and biomass were significantly greater on vessel-reefs in comparison to surrounding natural reef areas. Haemulidae was the most abundant family on vessel-reefs, where it represented 46% of total fish abundance. The most abundant family on natural reefs was Labridae, where it accounted for 24% of total fish abundance. Mean species richness was significantly greater on vessel-reefs than neighboring natural reefs and also differed among vessel-reefs. Both mean fish abundance and mean species richness were not significantly different between natural reefs neighboring vessel-reefs and natural reefs with no artificial structures nearby. This suggests the vessel-reefs are not, in general, attracting fish away from neighboring natural reefs in our area. Additionally, economically important fish species seem to prefer vessel-reefs, as there was a greater abundance of these species on vessel-reefs than surrounding natural reef areas. Fish assemblage structure on natural versus artificial reefs exhibited a low similarity (25.8%). Although no one species was responsible for more than 6% of the total dissimilarity, fish assemblage trophic structure differed strikingly between the two reef types. Planktivores dominated on vessel-reefs, accounting for 54% of the total abundance. Conversely, planktivores only made up 27% of total abundance on natural reefs. The results of this study indicate vessel-reef fish assemblages are unique and that these fishes may be utilizing food resouces and habitat characteristics not accessible from or found at natural reefs in our area. Production may also be occuring at vessel-reefs seems to be minimal.",,,,,39th European Marine Biology Symposium39th European Marine Biology Symposium,"JUL 21-24, 2004JUL 21-24, 2004",Univ Genova; Italian Soc Marine BiolUniv Genova; Italian Soc Marine Biol,"Genoa, ITALYGenoa, ITALY",72,1,0,0,63,5,76,,,0018-8158,1573-5117,,,,,,,,,,"Nova SE Univ, Farquhar Coll Arts & Sci, Davie, FL 33314 USANSUOC, Oceanog Ctr, Dania, FL USAGuy Harvey Res Inst, Dania, FL USANatl Coral Reef Inst, Dania, FL 33004 USA",NSUOCGuy Harvey Res InstNatl Coral Reef Inst,,,2007-04-01,WOS:000245895800015,,,,,

To test the hypothesis that offshore wind power increases the abundance of reef species relative to a reference area, we conduct an experiment on the model species common shore crab (Carcinus maenas). Overall, 3962 crabs were captured, observed, marked and released in 2011 and 1995 crabs in 2012. Additionally, carapace size, sex distribution, color morphs and body condition was recorded from captured crabs. We observed very low recapture rates at all sites during both years which made evaluating differences in population sizes very difficult. However, we were able to estimate population densities from the capture record for all three sites. There was no obvious artificial reef effect in the Lillgrund wind farm, but a spill-over effect to nearby habitats cannot be excluded. We could not find any effect of the wind farm on either, morphs, sex distribution or condition of the common shore crab.

Pre-fabricated habitat units can be cheaply and easily cast from concrete into heterogeneous three-dimensional shapes and surface topographies, with proven ability to enhance biodiversity on artificial structures. The net ecological benefits of enhancement using concrete, however, may be compromised on account of its large environmental footprint and poor performance as substrate for many marine organisms. We carried out a pilot study to trial alternative cast-able Reefcrete concrete mixes, with reduced environmental footprints, for use in the marine environment. We used partial replacement of Portland cement with recycled ground granulated blast-furnace slag (GGBS), and partial replacement of coarse aggregate with hemp fibres and recycled shell material. We calculated the estimated carbon footprint of each concrete blend and deployed replicate tiles in the intertidal environment for 12 months to assess their performance as substrate for marine biodiversity. The hemp and shell concrete blends had reduced carbon footprints compared to both ordinary Portland cement based concrete and the GGBS based control concrete used in this study. At the end of the experiment, the hemp and shell blends supported significantly more live cover than the standard GGBS control blend. Taxon richness, particularly of mobile fauna, was also higher on the hemp concrete than either the shell or GGBS control. Furthermore, the overall species pool recorded on the hemp concrete was much larger. Community compositions differed significantly on the hemp tiles, compared to GGBS controls. This was largely explained by higher abundances of several taxa, including canopy-forming algae, which may have facilitated other taxa. Our findings indicate that the alternative materials trialled in this study provided substrate of equal or better habitat suitability compared to ordinary GGBS based concrete.

Comparative studies show that few sessile NIS are found in nearby natural habitats, but little is known about the processes affecting the spread of NIS into these habitats. In southern British Columbia, the invasive colonial ascidian Botrylloides violaceus is widespread, but is far more common on man-made structures at marinas and aquaculture facilities than adjacent natural rocky reefs. To determine whether predation by native species, one element of biotic resistance, influences the successful infiltration of B. violaceus into natural benthic habitats, we conducted a series of predator exclusion experiments. Established adult colonies and newly settled juvenile B. violaceus were transplanted onto replicate PVC panels and deployed at marina pilings and adjacent natural rocky reefs at two locations. Panels were assigned to caged, uncaged, and procedural control treatments to test whether predator exclusion changed survivorship. Both juvenile and adult ascidian survival was significantly lower in uncaged treatments, suggesting that predation can limit the abundance and distribution of this species. Results were similar between piling and rocky reef habitats regardless of life stage and our results suggest that adult and juvenile B. violaceus are vulnerable to predation in both habitats studied. If B. violaceus propagules can disperse from dock floats and infiltrate adjacent natural rock, biotic resistance, through predation by native species, may diminish the likelihood of successful colonization in these habitats. Ensuring that natural habitats and native benthic communities remain healthy and intact may reduce the likelihood that invasive ascidians will spread beyond anthropogenic introduction sites where they can dominate the fouling community.

However, environmental uncertainties concerning variables such as wave height and wind speed are crucial because these may affect installation and maintenance operations with potential delays and financial consequences. In order to include these uncertainties into the duration estimation, adequate tools should be developed to simulate an installation scenario for a large number of historical environmental data. Data regarding environmental time series are usually scarce and limited, therefore they should be modelled. Since the environmental variables are in reality dependent, we propose a probabilistic method for their construction using copulas. To demonstrate the effectiveness of this method compared to the cases where observed or independently constructed environmental time series are used, a realistic cable installation scenario for an offshore wind farm was simulated. It was found that the proposed method should be followed to acquire more reliable and accurate estimation of the installation's duration. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

J,,,,,,,,,,,The MPSE SeaAngel Programme: Project 4 Offshore Marine Engineering,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Awarded Grant,Mar 31 2010,2010,"Efficient Offshore Wind ProgrammeWhat is the Efficient Offshore Wind Programme?The Efficient Offshore Wind programme (EOW) is a collaborative research and development programme led by Mitsubishi Power Systems Europe with partners SSE, Technip Offshore Wind and Wood Group Renewables. Research and development activity under the programme commenced in April 2010 and is expected to be completed during 2015.What will it deliver?The participants have come together to address the technology challenges facing the offshore wind sector. For example the programme will make use of pioneering hydraulic drive technology, developed in the UK, to produce an innovative drive train system designed for application in a high power offshore wind turbine, specifically in the Mitsubishi SeaAngel™ class of wind turbine under development. Many elements of offshore wind farm design will be researched from the perspective of reducing the cost of energy, including; capital cost, reliability, availability, electrical generation and grid compliance, transport and installation, substructure design and installation, operation and maintenance, and health and safety.Why is it unique?Technical collaboration between leading members of the value chain at such an early stage is unusual. By collaborating with their combined experience and expertise, the consortium will be better equipped to make more effective design decisions. This will contribute to a better understanding and management of the interfaces and specific challenges in offshore wind power. It will also improve efficiency within all areas of the value chain, from design development to through-life operation and therefore provide a contribution to reducing the overall cost of energy.How will it benefit the UK?The UK is the largest offshore wind market in the world and is keen to become a world leader in offshore wind technology. It is intended that the programme will boost confidence to the market and help the industry and Government deliver the vision for offshore wind namely; competitively priced renewable energy and wider economic and environmental benefits. The Programme will enhance the ability of the UK to deliver ‘Round 3’ offshore wind farm developments as well as making a contribution towards the development of the emerging UK offshore wind supply chain. The Programme will help prove the viability of offshore wind and enhance the position of the United Kingdom as a centre of excellence for offshore wind.What are the specific research areas?The Efficient Offshore Wind Programme comprises a number of projects:Hydraulic Digital Displacement® drive train development:• Artemis Intelligent Power, since 2010 a group company of MPSE, is working with Mitsubishi engineers to create a digitally controlled, highly responsive hydraulic wind turbine transmission. The hydraulic transmission obviates the need to use traditional gearbox and frequency converter. As these two items are often the source of faults in a wind turbine, substituting them is intended to improve reliability, maintainability and ultimately reduce the cost of energy.• Wind, and particularly offshore wind, is an application area where the legendary robustness of hydraulic transmissions is desirable, however it has to date been rejected for this application primarily due to its low part-load efficiency. Digital Displacement® Technology was created to address this deficiency; the Efficient Offshore Wind Programme provides an exciting opportunity to scale up this technology to the demanding high power and performance levels of offshore wind.• With its infinitely variable transmission ratio, a Digital Displacement® transmission can be coupled with the varying low-speed wind-turbine rotor to one or more high constant-speed, medium voltage, wound-rotor, synchronous generators. These are the same kind of machines that are used in conventional power stations where they are renowned for their ability to provide network support and for their graceful behaviour during transient network faults.• Digital Displacement® machines have a fully modular construction which offers the opportunity that if necessary almost all components can be swapped out from within the wind turbine nacelle. This is an important advantage in offshore wind-turbines where it is essential to carry out maintenance without costly support from crane barges or jack-up vessels. The high degree of integration between the electronic and mechanical components of Digital Displacement® machines will provide inbuilt performance and condition monitoring. This is particularly important in offshore wind where a very long design life is sought, service intervals are infrequent and technician access may not be possible for weeks at a time.Supply chain development and risk mitigation• In the development of novel technology it is vitally important that the supply chain is engaged at an early stage so that it understands the requirements of the new technology, and is able to deliver the required innovation whilst balancing quality improvement and cost reduction challenges as the project develops and moves into the exploitation stage.• The consortium partners all share the Government's desire to see the localisation of the supply chain and will work through this programme to engage with the industry. Contributing towards a strong local supply chain is one of the key ways in which the UK can attract the wider economic benefits of offshore wind, whilst also helping to enhance its viability.• A further element of the project will investigate ways of reducing the number of interfaces between equipment from different suppliers and to increase standardisation across the value chain, through collaboration between the consortium partners at this early stage.• In the development of new technology it is critical to understand how it can be exploited and brought to the market. A key barrier to the deployment of new technology is its perceived risk in the eyes of the finance and insurance communities. Through early engagement with finance and insurance stakeholders this work package will help to reduce barriers to the deployment of new technology both through better understanding of the associated risks and through the development of risk mitigation strategies that reduce the associated insurance premium.Optimised substructure design• The substructure is affixed to the seabed and provides structural support to the wind turbine tower, as well as providing an interface route to the subsea cable connection. It must be capable of handling the loads imparted by the sea and weather conditions and from the wind turbine. In addition it is subject to the harsh marine environment, presenting material erosion and corrosion challenges during operational life.• The aim of this project is to develop an optimised substructure and transition piece concept for supporting large offshore wind turbines, suitable for low cost bulk manufacture and installation.• The end design will be adaptable to a range of water depths and sea-bed conditions through the utilisation of bespoke design codes that address both engineering and regulatory requirements, for example end of life decommissioning.Transport and installation, cable connection• This project will develop a viable range of concepts for electrical power connection from the wind turbine. This work will include the development of new methodologies for the sea bed installation of cable arrays, cable pull-in techniques, cable protection and connection.• In addition, this project will develop and document a range of competitive solutions for land-based logistics at the port and water-based logistics for transport and installation of Mitsubishi SeaAngel™ class wind turbines. These will be developed to fulfil Round 3 requirements such as medium volume production, representative distance from shore, wave height and water depth.Operation and maintenance, health and safety• To achieve an offshore wind farm design life of over twenty years, a sophisticated approach to operations and maintenance is required. The partners will seek to develop an integrated operations and maintenance strategy by drawing on their combined experience, particularly that derived from the oil and gas sector.• Within the Efficient Offshore Wind Programme, the operations and maintenance philosophy will be developed at an early stage in the design process. In this way it is intended that design decisions can be made in consideration of maintenance requirements to deliver enhanced operational efficiency.• The learning outcomes from the offshore oil and gas industry will be built upon in the development of operations and maintenance procedures. Health and safety risk identification, assessment and mitigation shall be carried out to validate all procedures to ensure that safety of operation and maintenance activity is prioritised.• Optimal component replacement strategies for key components on the offshore wind turbine will be developed with particular consideration to health and safety. These replacement strategies will, where possible be verified at an onshore demonstration site in the UK and if required further refined.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,110063,,,,,,,,"Mitsubishi Hitachi Power Systems Europe, Ltd.","Mitsubishi Hitachi Power Systems Europe, Ltd.",,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:15325588,,,,,

Offshore KPIs are used by both duty holders and regulators to assess the reliability of equipment and systems, often they relate to safety systems and the regulator's interest relates to such systems. The most obvious KPIs include number of fatalities, fatal accident rate, lost time injury frequency and total recordable incident rate, as well as hydrocarbon release incident rates associated with maintaining safety. Many of the non-headline KPIs relate to systems that could be critical in the event of an accident and these are of great importance. However KPIs have not yet been developed for the performance of the offshore structural system. Performance standards are a requirement of current UK offshore legislation, although these again are more normally associated with fire and explosion. Since many offshore installations are now in the ageing phase performance measures are increasingly important. This paper described the background to developing KPIs for offshore structures, relating to aspects which are important for both safety and asset integrity. This has been achieved based on a hazard approach, which includes extreme weather, fatigue, corrosion and accidental damage. KPI's need to be measurable and this aspect has been incorporated in their development. It is proposed that these KPIs will have significant use in providing a basis for measuring structural performance, particularly for ageing installations where a case for life extension needs to be made.",,,,,27th International Conference on Offshore Mechanics and Arctic Engineering27th International Conference on Offshore Mechanics and Arctic Engineering,"JUN 15-20, 2008JUN 15-20, 2008","ASME, Ocean, Offshore, & Arct Engn DivASME, Ocean, Offshore, & Arct Engn Div","Estoril, PORTUGALEstoril, PORTUGAL",3,0,0,0,0,0,3,,,,,978-0-7918-4822-7,,,,,,,,,"Cranfield Univ, Cranfield MK43 0AL, Beds, England",,,,2008-01-01,WOS:000263581100014,,,,,

We evaluated spatial distribution patterns and habitat-use of the marine mesopredator, giant Pacific octopus (Enteroctopus dofleini), relative to terrestrial urbanization intensity in Puget Sound, Washington, USA. Using field surveys and citizen-contributed data for E. dofleini, we examined whether: (1) Distribution was related to urbanization, (2) Abundance was related to the extent of benthic anthropogenic debris, and (3) Diet differed as a function of urbanization and den cover. Our results suggest that urbanization impacts may differ with depth. Mixed-effects logistic regression model estimates for the probability of occurrence increased with urbanization in deep-water (> 24 m), and decreased with urbanization in shallow water (< 18 m). Accompanying field surveys indicated that E. dofleini abundance was correlated with the number of benthic anthropogenic debris items, and that E. dofleini diets were not affected by urbanization intensity or den cover.

This leaves the experience-based attitude and demographic relations analysis relatively unexplored. The present studies aims at covering some of that seemingly uncharted territory by analysing attitudes from a sample of more than 1000 respondents. Applying an Ordered Probit Model, the results show general positive attitudes towards offshore wind farms and that the attitude formation seems to be a function of the gender, income, level of education, visit frequency and type of visit to the beach and the view to on-land turbines from the residence. Interestingly and perhaps the most interesting results, the observed relations between demographics and attitude are found to be dependent on the type and frequency of usage of the beach among the respondents. Attitudes towards offshore wind farms and demographic associations are thus found to be more evident in the case that respondents do use not the beach for walking on a relatively frequent basis but much weaker if the respondent use the beach on a frequent basis. However, these results are sensitive to the type of beach usage. This Suggests that attitude formation towards offshore wind farms appear to be dependent on a combination of the type and frequency of use of the beach. To the author's knowledge these findings are novel, as such relation has not yet been identified in the literature. As such, the results sited light on a new angle in both the literature focusing on the opposition formation towards wind power projects in general and offshore wind farms in particular.

There were three stages of field study: registering the wells and pollution sources, measuring the water levels, and groundwater sampling for laboratory analysis. The results obtained with the GOD method demonstrate the predominance of moderate- to high natural vulnerability of the aquifer to pollution in the areas close to the wind park in the district of Amarelas (Xavier and Ziu beach) and revealed high pollution loads according to the POSH method. The directional vectors of the underground flow are meaningful for Xavier Beach (high vulnerability), the center of Amarelas (moderate vulnerability), Tapuiu and Montevideo (low vulnerability). This indicated that the wind farm may have a potential impact on the lowering of groundwater in the area. From the multivariate analysis, it is evident that the groundwater characteristics are strongly related to the geological formation of the wells (Dunas and Barreiras), showing all samples within the Tolerable Maximum Value for human consumption for TDS, hardness, turbidity, and pH. It is vital to carry out preliminary studies of the aquifers underlying the areas where wind farms are to be installed, considering the levels of vulnerability and the risks of pollution and alteration of the water supply.",,"Resumo A pesquisa objetivou avaliar os níveis de alteração dos aquíferos a partir da instalação de parques eólicos sobre dunas no litoral do Ceará por meio dos métodos de vulnerabilidade GOD e POSH, fluxo subterrâneo e aplicação da análise multivariada para subsidiar no monitoramento da qualidade da água subterrânea na área. Foram realizadas três etapas de campo: cadastro dos poços e fontes de poluição, medição de nível d’água e coleta de amostras de água subterrânea para análises laboratoriais. Os resultados obtidos com o método GOD demonstram o predomínio de moderada a alta vulnerabilidade natural do aquífero à poluição nas áreas do entorno do parque eólico do distrito de Amarelas (praia de Xavier e Ziu) que estão próximas ao parque eólico e que foram classificadas de acordo com o método POSH, com elevadas cargas poluidoras. Os vetores direcionais do fluxo subterrâneo estão com sentido para a praia de Xavier (vulnerabilidade alta), sede de Amarelas (vulnerabilidade moderada), Tapuiu e Montevidéu (vulnerabilidades baixas), significando que o parque eólico pode ser um potencial impacto no rebaixamento do lençol freático na área. A partir da análise multivariada, observa-se que as características das águas subterrâneas estão fortemente relacionadas com a formação geológica dos poços (Dunas e Barreiras), conferindo todas as amostras dentro do Valor Máximo Permitido para consumo humano para STD, dureza, turbidez e pH. Ressalta-se a importância em realizar estudos preliminares dos aquíferos subjacentes às áreas onde pretende-se instalar parques eólicos, considerando-se os níveis de vulnerabilidade e os riscos à poluição e alteração do aporte hídrico.",,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,1980-993X,,,,,,,,,,,"Universidade Federal do Ceará, BrazilUniversidade Federal da Bahia, Brazil",Universidade Federal do CearáUniversidade Federal da Bahia,,,2020-01-09,SCIELO:S1980-993X2019000600300,,,,,

We assessed seasonal daytime planktivory patterns over fifteen months (Apr 2003 to Jun 2004) at a temperate site in eastern Long Island Sound, CT. Planktivory was measured using modified Plankton Tethering Units (PTUs) deployed from floating docks and baited with live brine shrimp. Planktivory risk varied throughout the year. The highest levels of risk occurred in Aug, Sept and Oct (85%, 75% and 42.5% of brine shrimp consumed, respectively), the lowest levels of risk occurred from Dec to Apr. Mean monthly consumption of brine shrimp strongly correlated with the presence of planktivorous fish. Many species of benthic invertebrates exhibited high levels of recruitment during times of the year when planktivory risk was high, although some species recruited when planktivory risk was low. These seasonal planktivory patterns (highest risk occurring during the late summer and early fall) may be typical for many temperate near-shore habitats, especially those associated with man-made structures (e.g., floating docks, pilings).

The construction of artificial reefs on sandy bottoms is a possible option to decrease diving pressure on natural reefs. In the present study we tested this hypothesis by submerging an experimental artificial reef anchored to the bottom at 18 m depth and floated vertically 3 m below water surface. The reef was composed of PVC plates, attached both vertically and horizontally along a wire. Propagules of two coral species, the stony coral Stylophora pistillata and the soft coral Dendronephthya hemprichi, were transplanted to this artificial reef. Planulae of S. pistillata were obtained during the breeding season, seeded in petri dishes in the laboratory and after 2 wk the dishes were transferred to the experimental artificial reef. Automized fragments of D. hemprichi which had previously settled on 10 x 10 cm PVC plates were transplanted onto the experimental artificial reef. The survivorship of the transplanted D. hemprichi colonies was significantly higher on the lower sides of shallower plates. Survivorship of S. pistillata colonies increased with depth when located on the vertical plates, or on the upper sides of the horizontal plates. The highest survivorship of this coral was on the vertical plates and on the upper sides of the horizontal plates, while very low survivorship was recorded on the lower sides. The results indicate that vertical artificial surfaces offer the optimal biotic and abiotic conditions for the survival of the two examined corals. The vertical plates are characterized by low sedimentation rates, low coverage of turf-algae, minimal grazing by sea urchins and absence of the competitor tunicate Didemnum sp. In addition, the vertical orientation of the experimental plates reduces shading and offers the required light intensity for zooxanthellate corals such as S. pistillata. Only a few studies to date have tried to implement artificial reefs in a coral reef environment. The results of the present study indicate the potential of enhancing recruitment of corals by transplantation of juvenile recruits onto appropriate artificial structures. Maximal survivorship of these recruits is dependent upon the structural features of the artificial reef, which should offer optimal conditions.",,,,,,,,,53,5,0,0,33,1,64,,,0025-3162,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1997-02-01,WOS:A1997WJ44700017,,,,,

Today, Dublin Port is the busiest port in Ireland, handling 31 million tonnes of cargo a year and over 1.6 million ferry passengers and covering an area of 260 hectares in the centre of Dublin Bay, which encloses an area of about 296 km(2). Close to the port there are wetlands that are home to internationally important populations of birds and a range of coastal, intertidal and subtidal habitats, many of which are protected under EU and other legislation. The bay has been designated as a UNESCO Biosphere.Dublin has a population of over a million people. The bay has high cultural value and is extensively used for recreation. There is a power station and a waste water treatment plant close to the port, together with oil storage, scrap metal recycling and cement manufacture. There were some shell and fin-fish fisheries in the past but commercial fishing is very limited today, although there are some important nursery areas for fish species harvested in the Irish Sea. Levels of contaminants have reduced in sediments due to reductions in shipbuilding, although concentrations of PAHs, metals and a range of pesticides are high in some areas. Dublin is a major oil trans-shipment port and oil exploration has been proposed in the bay, so there is risk of further oil contamination. Water quality is generally good, but sewage infrastructure and treatment capacity need further enhancement to sustain recent improvements. Sea level rise will bring increased risk of coastal flooding and threatens some of the wetland habitats. Additional sea-defences will further add to the extent of artificial structures along the foreshore. Dublin Port is set to expand and there are concerns over invasive species and climate change, particularly given lack of knowledge of potential impacts of invaders and the complex combined effects of multiple local and global stressors.Coastal management is currently characterised by a sectoral approach; greater integration is needed. It is beginning to develop, partly due to recent EU directives and stakeholder engagement will be facilitated by the Dublin Bay Biosphere partnership. Having expanded at the expense of the coastal environment, Dublin City and Port are now beginning to reconnect with nature and with people who are increasingly recognising the value of natural capital and ecosystem services.

J,,,,,,,,,,,The MPSE SeaAngel Programme: Project 1 Digital Displacement Transmission Design and Validation,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Awarded Grant,Mar 31 2010,2010,"Efficient Offshore Wind ProgrammeWhat is the Efficient Offshore Wind Programme?The Efficient Offshore Wind programme (EOW) is a collaborative research and development programme led by Mitsubishi Power Systems Europe with partners SSE, Technip Offshore Wind and Wood Group Renewables. Research and development activity under the programme commenced in April 2010 and is expected to be completed during 2015.What will it deliver?The participants have come together to address the technology challenges facing the offshore wind sector. For example the programme will make use of pioneering hydraulic drive technology, developed in the UK, to produce an innovative drive train system designed for application in a high power offshore wind turbine, specifically in the Mitsubishi SeaAngel™ class of wind turbine under development. Many elements of offshore wind farm design will be researched from the perspective of reducing the cost of energy, including; capital cost, reliability, availability, electrical generation and grid compliance, transport and installation, substructure design and installation, operation and maintenance, and health and safety.Why is it unique?Technical collaboration between leading members of the value chain at such an early stage is unusual. By collaborating with their combined experience and expertise, the consortium will be better equipped to make more effective design decisions. This will contribute to a better understanding and management of the interfaces and specific challenges in offshore wind power. It will also improve efficiency within all areas of the value chain, from design development to through-life operation and therefore provide a contribution to reducing the overall cost of energy.How will it benefit the UK?The UK is the largest offshore wind market in the world and is keen to become a world leader in offshore wind technology. It is intended that the programme will boost confidence to the market and help the industry and Government deliver the vision for offshore wind namely; competitively priced renewable energy and wider economic and environmental benefits. The Programme will enhance the ability of the UK to deliver ‘Round 3’ offshore wind farm developments as well as making a contribution towards the development of the emerging UK offshore wind supply chain. The Programme will help prove the viability of offshore wind and enhance the position of the United Kingdom as a centre of excellence for offshore wind.What are the specific research areas?The Efficient Offshore Wind Programme comprises a number of projects:Hydraulic Digital Displacement® drive train development:• Artemis Intelligent Power, since 2010 a group company of MPSE, is working with Mitsubishi engineers to create a digitally controlled, highly responsive hydraulic wind turbine transmission. The hydraulic transmission obviates the need to use traditional gearbox and frequency converter. As these two items are often the source of faults in a wind turbine, substituting them is intended to improve reliability, maintainability and ultimately reduce the cost of energy.• Wind, and particularly offshore wind, is an application area where the legendary robustness of hydraulic transmissions is desirable, however it has to date been rejected for this application primarily due to its low part-load efficiency. Digital Displacement® Technology was created to address this deficiency; the Efficient Offshore Wind Programme provides an exciting opportunity to scale up this technology to the demanding high power and performance levels of offshore wind.• With its infinitely variable transmission ratio, a Digital Displacement® transmission can be coupled with the varying low-speed wind-turbine rotor to one or more high constant-speed, medium voltage, wound-rotor, synchronous generators. These are the same kind of machines that are used in conventional power stations where they are renowned for their ability to provide network support and for their graceful behaviour during transient network faults.• Digital Displacement® machines have a fully modular construction which offers the opportunity that if necessary almost all components can be swapped out from within the wind turbine nacelle. This is an important advantage in offshore wind-turbines where it is essential to carry out maintenance without costly support from crane barges or jack-up vessels. The high degree of integration between the electronic and mechanical components of Digital Displacement® machines will provide inbuilt performance and condition monitoring. This is particularly important in offshore wind where a very long design life is sought, service intervals are infrequent and technician access may not be possible for weeks at a time.Supply chain development and risk mitigation• In the development of novel technology it is vitally important that the supply chain is engaged at an early stage so that it understands the requirements of the new technology, and is able to deliver the required innovation whilst balancing quality improvement and cost reduction challenges as the project develops and moves into the exploitation stage.• The consortium partners all share the Government's desire to see the localisation of the supply chain and will work through this programme to engage with the industry. Contributing towards a strong local supply chain is one of the key ways in which the UK can attract the wider economic benefits of offshore wind, whilst also helping to enhance its viability.• A further element of the project will investigate ways of reducing the number of interfaces between equipment from different suppliers and to increase standardisation across the value chain, through collaboration between the consortium partners at this early stage.• In the development of new technology it is critical to understand how it can be exploited and brought to the market. A key barrier to the deployment of new technology is its perceived risk in the eyes of the finance and insurance communities. Through early engagement with finance and insurance stakeholders this work package will help to reduce barriers to the deployment of new technology both through better understanding of the associated risks and through the development of risk mitigation strategies that reduce the associated insurance premium.Optimised substructure design• The substructure is affixed to the seabed and provides structural support to the wind turbine tower, as well as providing an interface route to the subsea cable connection. It must be capable of handling the loads imparted by the sea and weather conditions and from the wind turbine. In addition it is subject to the harsh marine environment, presenting material erosion and corrosion challenges during operational life.• The aim of this project is to develop an optimised substructure and transition piece concept for supporting large offshore wind turbines, suitable for low cost bulk manufacture and installation.• The end design will be adaptable to a range of water depths and sea-bed conditions through the utilisation of bespoke design codes that address both engineering and regulatory requirements, for example end of life decommissioning.Transport and installation, cable connection• This project will develop a viable range of concepts for electrical power connection from the wind turbine. This work will include the development of new methodologies for the sea bed installation of cable arrays, cable pull-in techniques, cable protection and connection.• In addition, this project will develop and document a range of competitive solutions for land-based logistics at the port and water-based logistics for transport and installation of Mitsubishi SeaAngel™ class wind turbines. These will be developed to fulfil Round 3 requirements such as medium volume production, representative distance from shore, wave height and water depth.Operation and maintenance, health and safety• To achieve an offshore wind farm design life of over twenty years, a sophisticated approach to operations and maintenance is required. The partners will seek to develop an integrated operations and maintenance strategy by drawing on their combined experience, particularly that derived from the oil and gas sector.• Within the Efficient Offshore Wind Programme, the operations and maintenance philosophy will be developed at an early stage in the design process. In this way it is intended that design decisions can be made in consideration of maintenance requirements to deliver enhanced operational efficiency.• The learning outcomes from the offshore oil and gas industry will be built upon in the development of operations and maintenance procedures. Health and safety risk identification, assessment and mitigation shall be carried out to validate all procedures to ensure that safety of operation and maintenance activity is prioritised.• Optimal component replacement strategies for key components on the offshore wind turbine will be developed with particular consideration to health and safety. These replacement strategies will, where possible be verified at an onshore demonstration site in the UK and if required further refined.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,110061,,,,,,,,"Mitsubishi Hitachi Power Systems Europe, Ltd.","Mitsubishi Hitachi Power Systems Europe, Ltd.",,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:15371013,,,,,
J,,,,,,,,,,,Enabling technology for robotic inspection and maintenance of offshore wind turbine blades,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Awarded Grant,Dec 01 2017,2017,"Offshore wind turbines operate in harsh and extreme environments such as the North Sea. As blades continue getting larger, their tip speeds can exceed 100m/s. At these speeds, any particulates in the air such as rain, dust, salt, inspects etc. can wear away the surface of the blade's leading edge, a phenomenon known as leading edge erosion. This, in turn, alters the aerodynamic shape of the blade, affecting the efficiency AND potentially exposing the blade to further and more serious damage, thereby reducing the life of the blade. Whilst the mechanisms that cause leading edge erosion are not yet fully understood, it can be said that at some point, ALL wind turbine blades will suffer from some form or degree of leading edge erosion during their life, which will need to be addressed.Maintaining blades in the offshore wind sector is an expensive and dangerous job. Typically, highly skilled rope access technicians have to scale down the blades to carry out leading edge repairs.This project aims to take the first steps of developing a robotic device to carry out a number of these detailed inspections and repetitive repairs on the leading edges of blades, freeing up the time of the skilled rope access technicians, enabling them to perform specialist repairs or upgrades to blades only they can do. This would enable more blades to be inspected and treated, maximising the electrical output of the turbines that in turn benefit the owner with increased revenues, maximise the CO2 savings that everybody benefit from and increasing the security of electrical supply for the end users.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,104078,,,,,,,,Bladebug Limited,,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:15380241,,,,,

Subsequently, a cost benefit analysis can be conducted to determine the feasibility of designing, constructing, and deploying artificial reefs to benefit a fishery. Here, we examine the effect of these artificial reefs deployments on the snow crab Chionoecetes opilio off Japan and the environmental factors with which it associates.

The cost of production and installation of fixed structures in deeper waters (i.e.>60 m), is not competitive. A viable solution is the use of floating substructures, floating offshore wind turbines (FOWT), attached to the seabed by mooring lines and anchors. However, the motions of a FOWT exposed to the environmental conditions at sea will be different and added aspects need to be taken into account when designing these structures. For example, the coupled effects between the turbine and the floater will influence the performance of the turbine. Aerodynamic loads will contribute for the damping of the system, the mean aerodynamic thrust loads will have an impact on the mooring loads and the mean torque on the rotor will generate heeling moments on the rotor. Additionally, gyroscopic moments for some types of floating structures may be significant, which may excite unwanted motions, for example yaw moments.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,2434824,,,,,,,,University of Edinburgh,,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:15350504,,,,,

Here we assess the acoustic impacts of an operating tidal current turbine (Paimpol-Brehat site, France) on marine fauna. Its source level (SL) has been measured in situ using 19 drifting transects at distances between 100 m to 2400 m from the turbine. SL ranged from 118 to 152 dB rel mu Pa@1 m in third-octave bands at frequencies between 40 and 8192 Hz. It is comparable to the SL of a 19 m boat travelling at 10kt speed. This SL was used to estimate the impact of this noise type based on acoustic propagation simulations. The acoustic footprint of the device corresponds to a 1.5 km radius disk. Our results show that within this area of greatest potential impact, physiological injury of the hearing apparatus of invertebrates, fishes and marine mammals is improbable. Behavioral disturbance may occur up to 1 km around the device for harbor porpoises only. This is of little concern for a single turbine. However, greater concern on turbine noise impact, particularly on behavioral reactions has to be granted for a farm with up to 100 turbine.

These are tridimensional frames formed by welding steel tubular members, which support the exploration and production facilities. The design of these structures follows working stress design (WSD) methods. However, the development of reliability analysis of structures has lead to the adoption of load and resistance factors design (LRFD) of structural systems, including in the offshore structures. The globalization of the oil and gas industry, and the need to provide a harmonized code for design, resulted in the publication of the International Standard Organization (ISO) design practice, which is LRFD based. The LRFD design method introduces load and resistance factors calibrated to produce uniform reliability levels. The adoption of this code requires the calibration of the loads and resistance factors that represent the local environmental conditions. As part of an ongoing work on the reliability based calibration of load and resistance factors for design of jacket platforms in Malaysia, this paper presents the statistical parameters of the geometrical and material properties of the tubular members of platforms fabricated and installed in Malaysia.

Fresh water availability and impact of fish production farms on the environment are strongly restraining the development of the activity, which is even declining in some countries such as France. Recirculation systems make it possible to decrease water consumption and facilitate waste treatment. Their economical feasibility is being demonstrated and they offer an alternative to developing fish farms. Whatever the rearing system, nutrients of feed are partially converted into fish flesh and most of them are thrown back as wastes into the environment. Integrated systems make it possible to convert such nutrients into algae, molluscs or fish and to release purified water.

This study focused on two main sites along the Atlantic coast (Aquitaine): the Porto artificial reef, located at Mimizan (1989) and the artificial reefs of Capbreton (1999). Both have been placed off the sandy coast at depths of 12-25 m.A standardized monitoring by visual censuses has been performed since 2009-2010 with 4 sampling points placed on different substrates (barge and concrete pipes) to cover the whole Porto site and 2 sampling points on concrete pipes and Typi unit at Capbreton.Twenty-two taxa were recorded on the Porto artificial reef, dominated by benthic fishes. First results indicated differences in taxa richness between the sampling points: the barge had a more important diversity than the assemblage of concrete modules. Hence, a gradient of habitat complexity is discussed in light of results on taxa richness and biomass assessments.Visual censuses revealed a specific richness of 36 taxa on artificial reefs of Capbreton with a significant difference between concrete pipes and Typi unit. Five taxa were counted every year on both sites and could be considered as more representative of these artificial reefs: Trachurus trachurus, Umbrina sp., Trisopterus luscus, Conger conger, Blenniidae. Despite sharing common species, each site had its own species showing their complementarity.Different temporal variations were found on both sites, in particular at Capbreton where pelagic fishes in 2010 have been replaced in 2013 by benthic fauna.These pioneering analyses on the Aquitaine coast require further research, particularly on the temporal evolution of abundances and biomass.

With thousands of platforms to be decommissioned around the world in coming decades, understanding such dynamic interactions is key to improve spatial management of marine ecosystems.In this context, this study drafts a work plan that can be used to investigate fish presence and abundance, school movement and qualitative species composition around a platform over long time periods. It integrates fishing captures, multibeam echosounder (MBES) investigations, and drop camera shootings to overcome the limitations of the individual methods. Monthly samplings were conducted at a three-leg gas extraction platform placed at similar to 80 m depth in the central Adriatic Sea, for one year after its installation. MBES completely insonified the studied area, providing data on school shape, volume, surface area and position throughout the water column. Fishing captures were useful for MBES targets' identification by measuring the presence/abundance of nekto-benthic and pelagic species both in the nearby of the structure and in the open sea, while drop camera shootings added evidence of a few species in close proximity to the poles, which were not censused by the other methods.

This led to significant changes in the zooplankton community, including the appearance of freshwater taxa such as rotifers, cyclopoids (Mesocyclops sp. and Thermocyclops sp.), freshwater cladocerans and insect larvae, reflecting the freshwater conditions. Most estuarine species became less abundant or were absent two years after mouth closure. The estuarine copepod Pseudodiaptomus hessei was least affected and remained dominant. The copepod Acartia natalensis was absent after the first two sampling sessions and only reappeared after the mouth was breached in August 1995.

Coupled analysis on mooring-buoy interactions has been paid more and more concern for recent years. For floating offshore structures at sea, the motions driven by environmental loads are inevitable. The movement of mooring lines occurs due to the excitation on the top by floating structures. Meanwhile the lines restrict the buoy's motion by forces acting on the fareleads. Positioning is the main function of mooring system, its orientation effects can't be ignored for floating structures such as semi-submersible, FPS, and TLP, especially when the buoy's equilibrium position shifting to another place. Similar as hydrostatic restoring forces, mooring force related with the buoy's displacement can be transformed into mooring stiffness and can be added in the differential equations of motion, which is calculated at its equilibrium point. For linear hydrodynamic analysis in frequency domain, any physical quantity should be linear or be linearized, however mooring stiffness is nonlinear in essence, so the tangent or differential stiffness is used. Steel chains are widely used in catenary mooring system. An explicit formulation of catenary mooring stiffness is derived in this article, which consists of coupled relations between horizontal and vertical mooring forces.

Most of the offshore wind turbines installed to date are located in relatively shallow water and are mounted on fixed bottom support structures. Given the limitation of suitable shallow water sites available with high wind resources and also to reduce the environmental and visual impact of turbines, it is necessary to extend wind turbines to deeper water through the development of floating offshore wind turbine (FOWT) systems, which mount wind turbines on floating support platforms. The project aims to fill an important gap in the design, manufacturing and testing of emerging FOWT techniques by specifically characterising extreme loading on FOWTs under complex and harsh marine environments. These are typically represented by storm conditions consisting of strong wind, extreme waves, significant current, rising sea level and complex interplay between these elements, through a coordinated campaign of both advanced CFD modelling and physical wave tank tests. This has direct relevance to the current and planned activities in the UK to develop this new technology in offshore wind. In addition, the project aims to develop a suite of hierarchical numerical models that can be applied routinely for both fast and detailed analysis of the specific flow problem of environmental (wind, wave, current) loading and dynamic responses of FOWTs under realistic storm conditions. As an integral part of the project, a new experimental programme will be devised and conducted in the COAST laboratory at the University of Plymouth, providing improved understanding of the underlying physics and for validating the numerical models. Towards the end of the project, fully documented CFD software and experimental data sets will be released to relevant industrial users and into the Public Domain, so that they may be used to aid the design of future support structures of FOWTs and to secure their survivability with an extended envelope of safe operation for maximum power output.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,EP/T004150/1,,,,,,,,Manchester Metropolitan University,,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:15360416,,,,,

To update population status, we conducted surveys of 45 Pelagic Cormorant and 24 Double-crested Cormorant nesting colonies in 2014, and supplemented this survey with recent and historic counts conducted from 1955 to 2015. We modeled changes in population size over 6 decades to measure long-term population changes, and found strong non-linear trends that varied widely among colonies. Using years when all known colonies in the Strait of Georgia were surveyed, we documented that the Pelagic Cormorant population increased from 961 to 2234 nests in 1959-1974, remained fairly stable (approximately 2250-2450 nests) from 1974 to 1987, decreased after 1987 to approximately 1100 nests in 2000, and then rose slightly to approximately 1400 nests in 2014. The Double-crested Cormorant population increased from approximately 250 nests from 1959-1960, to approximately 1900 nests in 1987, before decreasing to approximately 600 nests in 2000, and remaining at this level through 2014.

The main factors apparently causing decline after 1987 are increased predation and disturbance by Bald Eagles (Haliaeetus leucocephalus), a potential reduction in availability of forage-fish prey, and human disturbance. Remaining large colonies offer some protection from eagle impacts (cliff habitats or man-made structures) or alternate avian prey for Bald Eagles, such as Glaucous-winged Gulls (Larus glaucescens) at Mandarte and Mitlenatch islands.

SEAs require extensive mapping of waterbird densities to define breeding and feeding areas of importance and sensitivity. Use of extensive large scale weather, military, and air traffic control surveillance radar is recommended, to define areas, routes and behaviour of migrating birds, and to determine avian migration corridors in three dimensions. EIAs for individual OWFs should define the key avian species present; as well as assess the hazards presented to birds in terms of avoidance behaviour, habitat change and collision risk. Such measures, however, are less helpful in assessing cumulative impacts. Using aerial survey, physical habitat loss, modification, or gain and effective habitat loss through avoidance behaviour can be measured using bird densities as a proxy measure of habitat availability. The energetic consequences of avoidance responses and habitat change should be modelled to estimate fitness costs and predict impacts at the population level. Our present ability to model collision risk remains poor due to lack of data on species-specific avoidance responses. There is therefore an urgent need to gather data on avoidance responses; energetic consequences of habitat modification and avoidance flights and demographic sensitivity of key species, most affected by OWFs.

The fish (n = 46) were implanted with acoustic transmitters in December 2004 and March 2005 and monitored for c. 12 months. The two principal metrics from the telemetry data, number of visits per day (N day(-1)) and residency (amount of time, s) were highly correlated (r > 0.948), and subsequent analyses were based on N day(-1). Rates of N day(-1) varied inconsistently among estuarine regions across diel periods and times of year for each river. In the Tambo River during autumn, winter and spring, the N day(-1) was greatest in the middle and upper estuarine regions during the day, and often greater in the lower region at dawn and dusk, but varied little among regions in summer. The provision of LWD had little effect on N day(-1) in the Tambo River. In the Mitchell River, N day(-1) varied little among estuarine regions without LWD, regardless of the time of day, and these patterns were consistent across seasons, but N day(-1) was significantly greater to the LWD during the day in winter and spring. Freshwater flows had little effect on monthly patterns of N day(-1) among regions in either estuary. The perceived 'benefits' to A. butcheri of re-establishing LWD within estuarine systems of south-eastern Australia depended strongly on the time of year, time of day and river system, but acoustic telemetry was a useful method of evaluating the use by fish of these artificial structures.

With this in mind, different protection methods have been used over time, most on the basis of the artificial nourishment of beaches and the building structures such as groynes and detached breakwaters. Detached breakwaters are artificial structures, generally parallel to the coastline, inspired by the working of natural formations, protecting a certain stretch from wave action and being able to create accretion areas. This is why these structures have been in general use, with different results, since the 1970s in countries such as Japan, the United States, Israel, Spain, Italy, and Australia.The study undertaken for this research focuses precisely on this type of structure, with the purpose of providing an overall view of the state of the art in this field. In addition, the effects of a detached breakwater on the shoreline for a series of real cases on the Spanish coastline were analysed to check whether the empirical relations given by different researchers for classifying the shoreline's type of response were fulfilled for them all or not. This study only takes formulas on the basis of the geometrical characteristics of breakwaters into consideration as being the most used by design engineers for predesigning a construction. All the formulas studied are based on the nondimensional B/X monomial, which is a ratio between the two most important geometric breakwater parameters (the length of the detached breakwater, B, and its distance to the initial coastline, X), so the result of this work led us to propose the following geometric model for the case of the Catalonian coastline: tombolo formation if B/X >= 1.3; salient formation if 1.3 > B/X > 0.5; limited shore response if 0.5 >= B/X.",,,,,,,,,13,0,0,0,4,0,13,,,0749-0208,1551-5036,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Politecn Madrid, Escuela Ingn Camino Canales & Puertos, E-28040 Madrid, Spain",,,,2008-09-01,WOS:000259385500019,,,,,

Given the pressures to develop offshore wind farms, there is an urgent need to assess population-level impacts on protected marine birds. Here we refine an approach to assess aspects of their ecology that influence population vulnerability to wind farm impacts, also taking into account the conservation importance of each species. Flight height appears to be a key factor influencing collision mortality risk but improved data on flight heights of marine birds are needed. Collision index calculations identify populations of gulls, white-tailed eagles, northern gannets and skuas as of particularly high concern in Scottish waters. Displacement index calculations identify populations of divers and common scoters as most vulnerable to population-level impacts of displacement, but these are likely to be less evident than impacts of collision mortality. The collision and displacement indices developed here for Scottish marine bird populations could be applied to populations elsewhere, and this approach will help in identifying likely impacts of future offshore wind farms on marine birds and prioritising monitoring programmes, at least until data on macro-avoidance rates become available.

This species has a native distribution in the western Indian Ocean, with a continuous presence along the southern and eastern coasts of Africa. In Eilat, the field survey found that H. spinosa was prevalent in shallow depths, on cryptic, shaded substrates. Histological analysis of spermatogenesis and oogenesis, and a determination of the gonad index in monthly samples revealed a seasonal reproductive cycle that was significantly correlated with seawater temperature, associated with photoperiod and food availability. All measures of reproduction showed the highest activity in the summer (June-August), and a short resting period in the winter months (December-March). H. spinosa individuals were rarely observed on artificial structures. Thus, the introduction of H. spinosa into new regions as part of a fouling community is relatively unlikely.

This can lead to overly conservative operating strategies such as preventing a rover on Mars from exploring a scientifically rich area due to potential hazards outside of the original operating envelope and can lead to unanticipated failures such as the loss of underwater autonomous vehicles operating in Earth's oceans. This paper presents an iterative method that links computer simulation of operations in unknown and dangerous environments with conceptual design of systems and development of control system algorithms. The Global to Local Path Finding Design and Operation Exploration (GLPFDOE) method starts by generating a general mission plan from low resolution environmental information taken from remote sensing data (e.g.: satellites, planefly-ovens, telescope observations, etc.) and then develops a detailed path plan from simulated higher resolution data collected in situ during simulator runs. GLPFDOE attempts to maximize system survivability and scientific or other mission objective yield through iterating on control system algorithms and system design within an in-house-developed physics-based autonomous vehicle and terrain simulator. GLPFDOE is best suited for autonomous systems that cannot have easy human intervention during operations such as in the case of robotic exploration reaching deeper into space where communications delays become unacceptably large and the quality of a priori knowledge of the environment becomes lower fidelity. Additionally, in unknown extraterrestrial environments, a variety of unexpected hazards will be encountered that must to be avoided and areas of scientific interest will be found that must be explored. Existing exploratory platforms such as the Mars Exploratory Rovers (MERs) Curiosity and Opportunity either operate in environments that are sufficiently removed from immediate danger or take actions slowly enough that the signal delay between the system and Earth based operators is not too great to allow for human intervention in hazardous scenarios. Using the GLPFDOE methodology, an autonomous exploratory system can be developed that may have a higher likelihood of survivability, can accomplish more scientific mission objectives thus increasing scientific yield, and can decrease risk of mission-ending system damage. A case study is presented in which an autonomous Mars Exploration Rover (MER) is generated and then refined in a simulator using the GLPFDOE method Development of the GLPFDOE methodology allows for the execution of more complex missions by autonomous systems in remote and inaccessible environments.",,,,,ASME International Design Engineering Technical Conference / Computer and Information in Engineering Conference (IDETC/CIE)ASME International Design Engineering Technical Conference / Computer and Information in Engineering Conference (IDETC/CIE),"AUG 21-24, 2016AUG 21-24, 2016","ASME, Design Engn Div; ASME, Computers & Informat Engn DivASME, Design Engn Div; ASME, Computers & Informat Engn Div","Charlotte, NCCharlotte, NC",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,978-0-7918-5010-7,,,,,,,,,"Colorado Sch Mines, Golden, CO 80401 USA",,,,2017-03-08,WOS:000393362900008,,,,,

A review of current human reliability techniques confirms that there is a lack of methodology for quantifying human errors while conducting complex physical operations in extreme environments. The developed methodology is based on a hierarchical Bayesian network accounting for causal dependencies among environmental factors, human error modes, and scenario-based activities. Also, a new model is developed with three refer-ence points (awareness of the situation, access to a system, and action) that derives human error modes (HEMs) from physiological failure mechanisms and helps an analyst identify the root causes of human errors. The proposed methodology is applied to estimate the likelihood of human error in two differ-ent scenarios in harsh operating conditions in floating offshore structures. The two scenarios are a set of different human activities in a workplace under defined operational and environmental conditions. The proposed methodology helps enhance the safety of human performance while considering effective physical factors. It will also help to reform current regulations for working in harsh environments.

Despite the loss of over half of the natural shoreline in many bays, little attention has been paid to the communities inhabiting armored shorelines and to the ecological implications of armoring. The goal of the present study was to examine factors affecting spatial and temporal variation of intertidal, hard-substrate biota (emergent species and fishes), with emphases on the influence of exposure, distance from the open ocean, and similarity to open-coast, hard-substrate communities. We examined community composition at eight San Diego Bay (California, USA) sites (an exposed and a protected site at four bay locations) in June and November 2000 and two open-coast sites in August 2000. At all bay sites, the shore was armored with granite boulders, a form of shoreline stabilization referred to as riprap. Community structure was more variable spatially than temporally on the scales we studied, affected more by distance from the bay mouth and exposure to wave energy than by differences between June and November. Exposed sites near the bay mouth were more similar to natural open-coast sites, sharing about 45% of their species, than protected sites and sites farther from the mouth, which shared as few as 8%. Species richness was generally higher in exposed than protected bay sites. Species tended to occur higher in the intertidal zone at exposed than protected sites, and higher in November, when sea level was higher, than in June. Such results will be useful to shoreline managers who examine the ecological implications of hardening long stretches of coastline and may suggest ways to incorporate artificial structures into ecosystems in a more meaningful way.",,,,,,,,,80,1,0,0,67,0,99,,,0025-3162,,,,,,,,,,,"Scripps Inst Oceanog, Integrat Oceanog Div, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA",,,,2002-01-01,WOS:000176790700018,,,,,

At the same time, the demand for raw materials and therefore the related environmental impacts increase due to technically more demanding wind energy converters and additional components (e.g. substructure) for the balance of plant. Additionally, due to environmental concerns offshore wind farms will be sited farshore (i.e. in deep water) in the future having a significant impact on the operation and maintenance efforts (O&M). Against this background the goal of this analysis is an assessment of the specific GHG (greenhouse gas) emissions as a function of the site conditions, the wind mill technology and the O&M necessities. Therefore, a representative offshore wind farm is defined and subjected to a detailed LCA (life cycle assessment). Based on parameter variations and modifications within the technical and logistical system, promising configurations regarding GHG emissions are determined for different site conditions. Results show, that all parameters related to the energy yield have a distinctive impact on the specific GHG emissions, whereas the distance to shore and the water depth affect the results marginally. By utilizing the given improvement potentials GHG emissions of electricity from offshore wind farms are comparable to those achieved onshore. (c) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Evidence from several studies indicates that nematodes can be highly sensitive to changes in the environmental quality. Here, we investigated the response of nematode assemblages to the presence of offshore gas platforms (located in the central Mediterranean Sea) in terms of spatial heterogeneity, structural and functional diversity. Since the effect of the investigated offshore platforms on macrofaunal assemblages were previously assessed by Terlizzi et al. (2008), the study provided also the opportunity to compare the response of different benthic compartments to the same impact related to fossil fuel extraction on marine environments. The platforms had a significant impact on nematode assemblages up to 1000 m distance from the structure. The effects were evident in term of: a) more homogeneous spatial distribution of nematode assemblages, b) increased trophic diversity of deposit feeders and c) changes in life strategies with an increase of opportunistic species in sediments closer to the platforms. Such effects seemed to be related to the dimension of the platform structures, rather than to chemical pollution or changes in food availability. These findings suggest that the platforms exert a physical alteration of the surrounding environment that is reflected by altered structural and functional traits of nematode biodiversity. The use of nematodes for monitoring the effects of the platforms only partially matched with the results obtained using macrofauna, providing further insights on potential outcomes on the functional response of marine assemblages to fossil fuel extraction.

Thus, the study of such parameters is useful in order to define environmental threats. Within the submerged sector of the Bagnoli coast and particularly in the southern part of the investigated area, there are sediment groups composed of very fine sands located in low-energy zones due to wave refraction and diffraction; they can also be found on the sea bottom and on the man-made structures typical of this zone. These areas show high pollutant levels of N, P, Cu, Fe, Mn, Ni, Pb, Zn, Cd, polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs). The northern area, a place of high-energy hydrodynamic processes, also shows high concentration levels of pollutants due to the presence of secondary cell circulation.Morphological research and analysis of textural characteristics of bottom sediments along the Bagnoli coast allowed the actual processes and their evolution in space and time to be defined. It has also been possible to correlate such processes to the seabed morphology system, the wave formations which affect the coast, the complex system of sediment transport, as well as to the man-made interventions in the area. The results of recent chemical analyses of beach sediments and bottom sediments off the Bagnoli coast were also incorporated. They prove the presence of heavy metals, PAHs and PCBs in high and sometimes very high concentrations.

The development of offshore wind farms in the area would provide hard substrata for the settlement of sessile benthos. Since the seafloor of the Adriatic is predominantly sedimentary this may alter the larval connectivity of benthic populations in the region. Here, we simulated the release of larvae from benthic populations along the coasts of the Adriatic Sea using coupled bio-physical models and investigated the effect of pelagic larval duration on dispersal. Our model simulations show that currents typically carry particles from east to west across the Adriatic, whereas particles released along western coasts tend to remain there with the Puglia coast of Italy acting as a sink for larvae from benthic populations. We identify areas of high connectivity, as well as areas that are much more isolated, and discuss how these results can be used to inform marine spatial planning and the licensing of offshore marine renewable energy developments.

This paper presents an analysis of 61 measured events of resonant vibrations of the Norstromsgrund lighthouse from 2001 until 2003. The vibrations of most of these events did not reach a steady state; thus, they violate an often-quoted criterion for frequency lock-in vibrations and remain outside any modes of ice-induced vibrations suggested in standards.Met-ocean data from both in situ measurements and from the Copernicus marine service information database are further used to better understand the occurrence of resonant ice-induced vibrations.

A Geographic Information System (GIS) and multi-criteria evaluation (MCE) techniques were combined to index suitable co-sites in the German exclusive economic zone of the North Sea. The MCE was based on criteria such as temperature, salinity or oxygen. In total, 13 possible aquaculture candidates (seaweed, bivalves, fish and crustaceans) were selected for the scenario configuration. The GIS modelling framework proved to be powerful in defining potential co-location sites. The aquaculture candidate oarweed (Laminaria digitata) revealed the highest suitability scores at 10-20 m depth from April to June, followed by haddock (Melanogrammus aeglefinus) at 20-30 m depth and dulse (Palmaria palmata) and Sea belt (Saccharina latissima) at 0-10 m depth between April and June. In summary, results showed several wind farms were de facto suitable sites for aquaculture since they exhibited high suitability scores for Integrated Multi-Trophic Aquaculture (IMTA) systems combining fish species, bivalves and seaweeds. The present results illustrate how synergies may be realised between competing needs of both offshore wind energy and offshore IMTA in the German EEZ of the North Sea. This might offer guidance to stakeholders and assist decision-makers in determining the most suitable sites for pilot projects using IMTA techniques. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Instrumentation on the device allows the dissipation of penetration-induced excess pore pressure to be recorded at various locations on the surface. From these dissipation responses the coefficient of consolidation can be inferred, which is a key parameter in the design of many offshore structures founded in surficial soil, such as pipelines or shallow foundations. The intent is that this device is deployed from a seabed frame, while other activities such as penetrometer testing or sampling take place in parallel. This paper presents robust interpretation methods for the parkable piezoprobe by using a combination of centrifuge experiments and large deformation finite-element analyses. The centrifuge tests demonstrate that the penetration response of the parkable piezoprobe is adequately captured by existing bearing capacity models, allowing the optimum device weight to be identified.

In the case of an integral abutment bridge (JAB), as an example, the backfill granular material is subject to slow cyclic stress and strain changes under drained conditions. These bridges are constructed so that the top deck is longitudinally continuous. In other words, IABs are joint-less bridges where the superstructure is connected with the abutment. The rigid connection enables the abutment and superstructure to act as a single structural unit, i.e., the expansion joints which are widely used in traditional bridges are removed in IABs. This removal is mainly due to the high costs of maintenance. The behavior of IABs is dominated by the cyclical temperature changes in the bridge deck. This results in the imposition of cyclical horizontal displacements to the backfill soil of the abutments. The present research is an effort to investigate the induced passive pressure on the IABs, using a laboratory model and an analytical approach. The results indicate that the passive pressure distribution is non-linear and its maximum value along the wall is dependent on the magnitude of the wall rotation and number of cycles. It seems that there are two different mechanisms for this behavior. In the above part of the wall, sand behaves as a plastic material.

The factors of safety, reliable, and extendable capacity are the major design concept. First of all, the demonstration project of the offshore wind farms at Taiwan is going to build three pilot wind farms and meteorological masts. The measurement of ocean environment is included sea surface wave, sea current, sea surface level, sea temperature and salinity. Thus, the instruments of wave gauge, acoustic Doppler current profiler (ADCP), and conductivity-temperature-depth (CTD) are required for the demonstration project. Moreover, the data collection of environmental impact assessment needs underwater noise meters and ocean bottom seismometer, which are also included in the underwater environment monitoring system. Based on the measurement quality and safety, a seabed mounted frame is used for protection all instruments. The overall weight is about 100 kg in air and about 60 kg in water. The underwater environment monitoring system has an underwater junction box that is a node to integrate for power supply and data transmitting of five instruments. The electric power and digital signals are transmitted by a hybrid cable in 150 m long within four pins copper conductors and two optical-fiber cables. The power loss rate in the copper conductors is about 5.025 ohm/km with the power supply of 220 VAC and 0.55 A. The power convertor in the junction box is AC-to-DC, which has input power of 100-240 VAC and output power of 12/48 VDC. The optical-fiber cable transmits the digital data via single-mode with a bandwidth over 156 Mbps, which is required by the underwater noise data with bandwidths from 80 kbps to 2.4 Mbps. The field testing had two stages, which were in a water tank and in the harbor over ten days. The preliminary testing tasks in a water tank were the correct rate of data collection and reliability of system operation.

Evaluating this risk at fine spatial and temporal scales can be challenging, especially in systems where wildlife-vehicle collisions are rare or imperfectly detected. The sizes and behaviors of wildlife and vehicles influence collision risk, as well as how much they co-occur in space and time. We applied a modeling framework based on encounter theory to quantify the risk of lethal collisions between endangered North Atlantic right whales and vessels. Using Automatic Identification System vessel traffic data and spatially explicit estimates of right whale abundance that account for imperfect detection, we modeled risk at fine spatiotemporal scales before and after implementation of a vessel speed rule in the southeastern United States. The expected seasonal mortality rates of right whales decreased by 22% on average after the speed rule was implemented, indicating that the rule is effective at reducing lethal collisions. The rule's effect on risk was greatest where right whales were abundant and vessel traffic was heavy, and its effect varied considerably across time and space. Our framework is spatiotemporally flexible, process-oriented, computationally efficient and accounts for uncertainty, making it an ideal approach for evaluating many wildlife management policies, including those regarding collisions between wildlife and vehicles and cases in which wildlife may encounter other dangerous features such as wind farms, seismic surveys, or fishing gear.",,,,,,,,,17,0,0,0,15,0,17,,,2150-8925,,,,,,,,,,,"Florida Fish & Wildlife Conservat Commiss, Fish & Wildlife Res Inst, St Petersburg, FL 33701 USAUS Geol Survey, Wetland & Aquat Res Ctr, Gainesville, FL 32653 USAUS Geol Survey, St Petersburg Coastal & Marine Sci Ctr, St Petersburg, FL 33701 USA",,,,2019-04-01,WOS:000472716600051,,,,,

India, which has predominantly used fossil fuels to power its generators need to make a switch to clean energy fuels. But renewable sources form a miniscule portion (26 GW,similar to 12%) of India's overall installed power capacity (210 GW). There is no contribution from offshore wind farms to the energy basket for India, as there is no policy framework to encourage the development of offshore wind farms. Several European countries have tapped the offshore wind energy potential to reduce their dependence on adopted by these countries to identify the core components (21 of them) of robust policy intervention. A detailed questionnaire was administered to 181 stakeholders of wind energy in India to seek their feedback on these building blocks. These core components (variables in research parlance) are then subjected to factor analysis to understand the underlying structure of the variables. The factor analysis logically reduces these 21 variables into five factors (Government support, fiscal and quota based incentives, availability of local expertise, capital for investments and building an enabling R&D ecosystem), which are then fed into a logistic regression model as 'independent variables' to predict the probability of growth of offshore wind energy (dependent variable) in the country. The logistic regression model gives the weight (the impact) of these independent variables in influencing the growth of offshore wind energy in India. It emerges that government support, fiscal and quota based incentives and building an enabling R&D ecosystem have a much higher impact on the growth of offshore wind energy for India. This paper fills the gap of absence of an empirically tested framework on offshore wind energy policy for India. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

These changes often coincide with major shifts in the composition and distribution of marine biota, however, rarely are hydrodynamic-mediated factors confirmed experimentally as the mechanism underpinning these shifts. This study first characterized hydrodynamic-related distribution patterns among epilithic and epiphytic microinvertebrates on urban seawalls in Singapore. We found reduced microinvertebrate abundances and distinct microinvertebrate community structure within benthic turf algae in areas where coastal defences had reducedwave energy and increased sediment deposition, among other hydrodynamic-related abiotic changes. Low-exposure areas also had reduced densities of macroinvertebrate grazers and less dense turf algae (lower mass per cm(2)) than adjacent high-exposure areas. Using harpacticoid copepods as a model taxon, we performed a reciprocal transplant experiment to discern between the effects of exposure-related conditions and grazing. Results from the experiment indicate that conditions associated with restricted wave energy from shoreline engineering limit harpacticoid population densities, as transplantation to low-exposure areas led to rapid reductions in abundance. At the same time, we found no effect from grazer exclusion cages, suggesting harpacticoids are minimally impacted by exposurerelated gradients in gastropod macrograzer densities over short time scales. Given the key role of intertidal microinvertebrates, particularly harpacticoids, in nearshore food webs, we postulate that human-engineered hydrodynamic regimes are an important factor shaping marine ecosystem functioning in urban areas.

Aiming at this issue, an integrated Finite Element Method (FEM) model of wave-seabed interaction is proposed to investigate the effects of wave action on the wave-induced slope stability of the temporary trench. The Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) equations are adopted to describe the wave motion in the fluid domain, while the seabed domain is described using the Mohr-Coulomb constitutive model. The wave-induced seepage pressure near the slope is determined by Darcy's law and considered as an external load in the analysis. The stability of the temporary slope is evaluated by the means of shear strength reduction. The present numerical model is firstly validated through the comparison with the analytical solution and the experimental data available in the literature. The integrated numerical model is then applied to a practical engineering application, including a new evaluation method of stability for the trench slope excavated temporarily for the fully-buried submarine pipelines at an actual site. The results indicate that the stability of submarine slope is closely related to the dynamic wave pressure from the upper seawater. The minimum of FOS (factor of safety) corresponding to the most dangerous situation is introduced as the stability index for the slope with specific slope ratio in the whole process of dynamic wave loading. Additionally, the wave-induced seepage pressure should be considered as external load in the design for the seabed with large permeability such as sandy soils.",,,,,,,,,13,3,0,0,0,0,16,,,0378-3839,1872-7379,,,,,,,,,,"Nanjing Tech Univ, Inst Geotech Engn, Nanjing 210009, Peoples R ChinaSouthern Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Ocean Sci & Engn, Shenzhen 518055, Peoples R ChinaGriffith Univ, Sch Engn & Built Environm, Gold Coast Campus, Gold Coast, Qld 4222, AustraliaShanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Dept Civil Engn, Shanghai 200240, Peoples R ChinaHuaqiao Univ, Inst Geotech Engn, Xiamen 361021, Fujian, Peoples R China",,,,2020-06-01,WOS:000532778300022,,,,,

As blades continue getting larger, their tip speeds can exceed 100m/s. At these speeds, any particulates in the air such as rain, dust, salt, insects, etc. can wear away the surface of a blade's leading edge, a phenomenon known as leading edge erosion (LEE). This, in turn, alters the blade's aerodynamic shape, affecting its efficiency and potentially exposing the blade to further and more serious damage, thereby reducing its working life.Whilst the extent and nature of contributing factors to LEE are not yet fully understood, it can be said that at some point in their lifespan, all wind turbine blades will suffer from some form or degree of LEE which will need to be addressed. Maintaining blades in the offshore wind sector is an expensive and dangerous job where, typically, highly skilled rope access technicians are required to scale down the blades to carry out leading edge repairs.Having successfully proven the concept in Phase 1 of the Innovate UK funding round, in this project, BladeBug Limited will continue its work with the Offshore Renewable Energy Catapult to develop, build and test a complete, walking robotic system designed specifically to carry out a number of these detailed inspections and repetitive repairs on the leading edges of wind turbine blades.The ability to perform these tasks remotely will free up time of skilled rope access technicians to undertake specialist repairs or upgrades to blades that only they can do. More blades could then be inspected and treated in the same time frames, maximising the electrical output of the turbines and, as a result, increasing revenues to turbine owners as well as the environmental benefit to everyone in CO2 savings.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,104833,,,,,,,,Bladebug Limited,,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:15305744,,,,,

There were three stages of field study: registering the wells and pollution sources, measuring the water levels, and groundwater sampling for laboratory analysis. The results obtained with the GOD method demonstrate the predominance of moderate- to high natural vulnerability of the aquifer to pollution in the areas close to the wind park in the district of Amarelas (Xavier and Ziu beach) and revealed high pollution loads according to the POSH method. The directional vectors of the underground flow are meaningful for Xavier Beach (high vulnerability), the center of Amarelas (moderate vulnerability), Tapuiu and Montevideo (low vulnerability). This indicated that the wind farm may have a potential impact on the lowering of groundwater in the area. From the multivariate analysis, it is evident that the groundwater characteristics are strongly related to the geological formation of the wells (Dunas and Barreiras), showing all samples within the Tolerable Maximum Value for human consumption for TDS, hardness, turbidity, and pH. It is vital to carry out preliminary studies of the aquifers underlying the areas where wind farms are to be installed, considering the levels of vulnerability and the risks of pollution and alteration of the water supply.

The hypothesis that shipwrecks support assemblages with trophic structure similar to that encountered on natural reefs was rejected. Artificial and natural reefs strongly differ in their trophic structure, both in their multivariate composition and in biomass of most guilds. Substrate characteristics such as rugosity and benthic cover were found to influence the trophic organisation of the communities. Moreover, slow-paced structural changes over time in both biotic and abiotic aspects of wrecks appear responsible for younger and older artificial reefs be dissimilar in respect to biomass density of most feeding guilds. However, the older artificial reef did not present any strikingly inter-mediate feature between the younger artificial reef and the natural reefs, evidencing that distinct trophic assemblages exist over wrecks. Finally, the results found indicate that the use of shipwrecks as mitigation tool for losses of natural reefs may not be fully appropriate as they greatly differ in trophic structure, and consequently in energy flow, from natural reefs. Also, setting shipwrecks near natural reefs should be avoided as they differ in resources availability for many species, which may alter the community structure of natural habitats.

The Veslefrikk B (VFB) platform was built in 1985 for drilling exploration but was converted to a production platform in 1989. Shortly thereafter extensive fatigue cracking was discovered and several repairs were made. However, extensive fatigue cracking continued and a retrofitting program was implemented, using various types of grinding and peening techniques. In 1999 the platform was temporarily decommissioned and dry-docked for a comprehensive repair and upgrading program, following the International Institute of welding (IIW) guidelines for weld improvement methods [1], this was completed in only four months. However, after a few more years of service fatigue damage again necessitated new repairs. The majority of cracks occurred in the hull skin plates and caused water leakage. It is noteworthy that cracking this time occurred only in areas of the structure that were left untreated in the first retrofitting program due to low levels of stress from FE analyses in these areas.

While the importance of coastal geomorphology in determining the patterns of biological communities is relatively well studied on the terrestrial side of the shoreline, the respective relationships have been rarely studied seaward from the shoreline. Therefore, we aimed to fill this research gap by relating coastal geomorphology to marine benthic biodiversity. We studied the variability of species richness of macroscopic seabed fauna and flora along different shore geomorphic types in the Gulf of Finland, Baltic Sea. The shore was classified into nine geomorphological types. Spatial buffers of sizes 125-1000 m (hereafter scales) were formed around each segment of shoreline and mean values of faunal, floral, and total species richness were calculated in each segment and scale. ANOVA revealed that biodiversity significantly differed between the shore types. Generally, the biodiversity was the highest among the types Scraps and steep slopes in sand, Exposed rocky cliffs with boulder talus base and Sheltered rocky rubble shores and the lowest among the type Exposed, solid man-made structures. Smaller spatial scales hosted higher biodiversity but the interaction between shore type and scale was not statistically significant. To conclude, the coastal geomorphology reflects the general patterns of underwater biodiversity, and thus, the information of shore geomorphic types can be used in coastal management and oil pollution combating prioritization in the case when the information of underwater biota is not available.",,,,,15th International Coastal Symposium (ICS)15th International Coastal Symposium (ICS),"MAY 13-18, 2018MAY 13-18, 2018",Korea Inst Ocean Sci & Technol; Korea Soc Coastal Disaster Prevent; JCR; Coastal Educ & Res FdnKorea Inst Ocean Sci & Technol; Korea Soc Coastal Disaster Prevent; JCR; Coastal Educ & Res Fdn,"Busan, SOUTH KOREABusan, SOUTH KOREA",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,0749-0208,1551-5036,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Tartu, Estonian Marine Inst, Tallinn, EstoniaTallinn Univ, Inst Ecol, Tallinn, Estonia",,,,2018-08-22,WOS:000441173100074,,,,,

Shallow (1-3 m) and deep (6-8 m) sampling sites, in natural areas and on man-made structures, were characterized by a structural complexity index (cavity index and mean size of cavity aperture), algal cover (encrusting, turfy, shrubby and arborescent algae) and the density of benthic herbivorous invertebrates and fish. A relationship between structural complexity and biota was only evident for some fish species (Diplodus spp. and Sarpa salpa) at deep sites, where they not only feed but also shelter. Three benthic herbivorous invertebrates, the sea urchins Paracentrotus lividus and Arbacia lixula, and the limpet Patella caerulea, are associated with communities dominated by encrusting algae. Variations in their abundance and role in structuring algal communities follow a depth gradient: P. caerulea and A. lixula are mainly present at shallow sites and P. lividus at deep sites. These benthic herbivorous invertebrates may account for the structure of shallow algal communities. In contrast, at deep sites, fishes (the omnivorous Diplodus spp. and the herbivorous S. salpa) have a potential importance in controlling sublittoral algae, in addition to invertebrates. It is suggested that the ecological impact of herbivorous and omnivorous fishes in temperate seas could be greater than is generally thought. Experiments should be designed to validate this postulate.

Habitat-based enhancements often deploy artificial reefs with the aim to increase the available structure to augment local production, yet current assessment approaches make it difficult to assess whether these reefs achieve pre-deployment goals. This makes it hard for managers to determine whether artificial reefs could improve their fishery outputs, potentially leading to missed opportunities and reduced production. We reviewed 270 research articles to determine whether existing monitoring studies identify whether artificial reefs meet their pre-deployment goals, thereby providing some evidence of their suitability for certain fisheries. We found only 62% of these studies clearly articulated the original goals of the reef. Goals were qualitative, and most studies were conducted over insufficient time frames to allow for ecological communities to stabilize and mature. It is therefore difficult to determine the success or failure of many artificial reefs in addressing the management issues for which they were deployed. In the light of these findings, we think the setting of explicit quantitative goals (which may be biological, social or economic), and monitoring the performance of reefs against these goals, could stimulate the broader application of artificial reefs in fisheries management strategies. Such an approach has been successfully adopted in aquaculture-based fisheries enhancement, and we explain how current evaluation methods such as harvest strategies can be easily adapted to quantitatively monitor artificial reef performance.",,,,,,,,,64,1,0,0,45,0,72,,,1467-2960,1467-2979,,,,,,,,,,"NSW Dept Primary Ind, Port Stephens Fisheries Inst, Taylors Beach, NSW, AustraliaNSW Dept Primary Ind, Recreat & Aboriginal Fisheries, Coffs Harbour Jetty, NSW, Australia",,,,2018-07-01,WOS:000437113100011,,,,,

It is a well established phenomenon that the variation of relative pile-soil stiffness (Krs) and load eccentricity (e/D) significantly affect the response of piles subjected to lateral static load. However, the influence of lateral cyclic load on axial response of single pile in sand, more specifically the effect of Krs and e/D on the cyclic behavior, is yet to be investigated. The present work has aimed to bridge up this gap. To carry out numerical analysis (boundary element method), the conventional elastic approach has been used as a guideline with relevant modifications. The model developed has been validated by comparing with available experimental (laboratorymodel and field tests) results, which indicate the accuracy of the solutions formulated.

Samples were obtained fortnightly throughout a two-year period by means of hauls performed with an experimental purse seine. Two control areas were established to check the aggregation efficiency of the FADs. A total of 16 families and 26 species of fishes were recorded beneath FADs. Pelagic fishes, largely Trachurus picturatus, T. mediterraneus, T. trachurus, Naucrates ductor, Seriola dumerili and Coryphaena hippurus, dominated the fauna. The total fish abundance, number of species and length range of the species confirmed that the FAD community was significantly related to season (recruitment period), resulting in a sequential fish colonisation of the FADs during the study period. Some of the species were present only during a particular period, such as Trachnrus spp. in spring and summer. Other species, although evident for a longer period, were more occasional in catches (Schedophilus ovalis, Balistes carolinensis and Polyprion americanus), and some others were also present in small quantities. Diversity and equitability of the fish community associated with FADs were higher in summer than in winter. Many species were more abundant around FADs than in open water controls. The species that showed the most distinct recruitment phase beneath the FADs were N. ductor, S. ovalis, Trachurus spp., P. americanus, S. dumerili, C. hippurus and B. carolinensis. FADs can be considered nursery structures for many pelagic and demersal species, thus having an effect on the redistribution of juveniles.

Determining wave impact loads accurately is of great significance to the design and operation of offshore structures. An experimental study was carried out to investigate the critical governing parameters for the horizontal wave impact loads on a semi-submersible. The wavelet denoising technique and the frequency response function method are employed successfully to remove the effect of noise and dynamic contamination from the experimental data. The strongly nonlinear characteristics of the wave impact load are demonstrated. The results show that wave impact events are governed by the upwell height and upwell velocity. Most major wave impact events occur where both the two parameters are large, and the upwell velocity is more dominant in the wave impact process. In general, larger parameters tend to result in larger peak pressures and higher probabilities of wave impacts. The motion behaviors of the platform are benefit to reduce the occurrence probabilities of wave impact events and maximum impact pressures, owing to the escape velocities following the wave direction and the rotations leading to the above-water structure away from the waves.

Wherever offshore structures protect the shore from the direct effects of swell, sheltered sandy beaches have developed in association with cuspate forelands and tombolos. In contrast to this open coast setting, the nearshore waters of the west coast are protected by semi-continuous reef systems, which significantly modify the morphology of large-scale accretionary landforms, beaches and foredune sequences. On the south coast, foredune plains occur primarily as fill in sheltered embayments and storm built ridges do not occur. Foredunes on the west-coast include washover ridges and low aeolian dunes on the backshore of embayment and inset beaches. The form of high wave-energy beaches of the south coast fluctuates between reflective and dissipative morphodynamic states, and most commonly between transitional and dissipative states. Sediments are mainly fine grained siliceous sands. In contrast, the low-energy west-coast beaches are composed of medium to coarse grained. calcareous sands. The beaches are planar in section, characterised by lines of debris deposited by tidal and longer-term fluctuations in sea-level and their form does not alter with short-term changes in the wave regime. Despite the very low energy micro-tidal conditions experienced by the coasts of southwestern Australia, systematic variation in the morphology of coastal landforms does occur. As protection to the coast increases from the open-fetch south-coast environment to the reef-protected west-coast setting, swell energy decreases, there is an increase in the relative importance of locally generated wind waves, wave set-up and tidal forcing of currents, and forelands become increasingly asymmetric due to the strength of longshore sediment transport.

This multi-level optimization method minimizes the costs of installation and operations and maintenance, and maximizes power development in a unidirectional wind case by selecting the size and position of turbines. The EPS combines a deterministic pattern search algorithm with three stochastic extensions to avoid local optima. The EPS has been successfully applied to onshore wind farm optimization and enables the inclusion of advanced modeling as new technologies for floating offshore wind farms emerge. Three advanced models are incorporated into this work: (1) a cost model developed specifically for this work, (2) a power development model that selects hub height and rotor radius to optimize power production, and (3) a wake propagation and interaction model that determines aerodynamic effects. Preliminary results indicate the differences between proposed optimal offshore wind farm layouts and those developed by similar methods for onshore wind farms. The objective of this work is to maximize profit; given similar parameters, offshore wind farms are suggested to have approximately 24% more turbines than onshore farms of the same area. EPS layouts are also compared to those of an Adapted GA; 100% efficiency is found for layouts containing twice as many turbines as the layout presented by the Adapted GA. Best practices are derived that can be employed by offshore wind farm developers to improve the layout of platforms, and may contribute to reducing barriers to implementation, enabling developers and policy makers to have a clearer understanding of the resulting cost and power production of computationally optimized farms; however, the unidirectional wind case used in this work limits the representation of optimized layouts at real wind sites. Since there are currently no multi-turbine floating offshore wind farm projects operational in the United States, it is anticipated that this work will be used by developers when planning array layouts for future offshore floating wind farms.",,,,,"35th ASME International Conference on Ocean, Offshore and Arctic Engineering35th ASME International Conference on Ocean, Offshore and Arctic Engineering","JUN 19-24, 2016JUN 19-24, 2016","ASME, Ocean Offshore & Arctic Engn DivASME, Ocean Offshore & Arctic Engn Div","Busan, SOUTH KOREABusan, SOUTH KOREA",1,0,0,0,0,0,1,,,,,978-0-7918-4997-2,,,,,,,,,"Oregon State Univ, Sch Mech Ind & Mfg Engn, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA",,,,2017-03-01,WOS:000393090900080,,,,,

Observational studies are needed to improve understanding of faunal assemblages supported by offshore infrastructure and better predict the effect of removal. Here, we present results from visual inspection and physical sampling of a small oil and gas industry structure decommissioned from an oil field in the North East Atlantic. This is supported by observations of similar structures nearby and by photographs of the surrounding seabed from environmental baseline surveys. The structure supported a reasonably high biomass and diversity of invertebrates (10 kg and 39 macrofaunal and 17 megafaunal species) and fishes (20 kg biomass and 4 species). The invertebrate megafaunal species present on the structure were a sub-set of the hard substratum fauna observed on surrounding seabed. Porifera were absent from the structure. Biological succession in the first 2 years occurred as follows. Sparse colonies of the hydroid Obelia sp. stet were early colonisers then subsequent development of thick hydroid turf (Obelia sp. stet. and Halecium sp. stet.) supported an invertebrate assemblage (2654 individuals kg wet mass -1 ) dominated by saddle oysters [Pododesmus squama (Gmelin, 1791) and Heteranomia sp. stet.)] and scale worms (Harmothoe spp.). Percentage cover of hydroid turf varied significantly over the structure, with most growth on sections exposed to strongest currents. Commercially important fish species present around the structure included Gadus morhua (Atlantic cod), Pollachius virens (saithe) and Lophius piscatorius (monkfish). Studies of artificial structures such as this provide much needed data to understand their role in the ecology of seafloor habitats and inform environmental decision making on all stages of industry from exploration to decommissioning. We show that the ecological role of the decommissioned three-dimensional structures was to enhance the biomass of a sub-set of epifaunal invertebrates found in the area. This supported diverse associated macrofaunal organisms, providing a food source for motile invertebrates and fishes in an area where background hard substratum can be lost through the impacts of drilling.

The Block Island pilot project would consist of 5-10 wind turbines generating about 12 megawatts (MW) of energy. A second larger wind farm is also proposed for nearshore waters (~15 miles S of Pt Judith) that could be in operation by 2014. However before either of these wind farms can be constructed, according to the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act and the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA; MMS 2008), federal regulatory agencies (e.g., US Fish and Wildlife Service [USFWS], Army Corps of Engineers [ACOE], Minerals Management Service [MMS]) require baseline assessments of natural resources, including avian populations, that might be affected by wind farm developments. Understanding the movement ecology of sea ducks is one of the key factors delaying the development of the Cape Wind farm north of Nantucket, MA, which has proposed building 130 wind turbines (Mass Audubon 2009). Surprisingly little quantitative information is known about the movement ecology of sea ducks in New England. We propose to implant satellite transmitters into Surf Scoters because this is a high priority species for the Sea Duck Joint Venture (SDJV 2009). There are numerous stakeholders that would be interested in the results of this study. First, the Governor of Rhode Island's intent on developing renewable energy sources in the state. Other state agencies, Department of Environmental Management (DEM) and Coastal Resources Management Council (CRMC), are interested in the potential development of nearshore wind resources. In addition, federal agencies (USFWS, BOEM, and ACOE) require baseline data provided by this study under NEPA. Local governments, such at the town council for New Shoreham, are interested in offshore wind resources and potential environmental impacts, thus these data would be informative. Non-government agencies, such at The Nature Conservancy and the Audubon Society of Rhode Island are extremely interested in potential impacts of wind turbines on wildlife, thus this quantitative information would be timely. This project meets two primary goals of the National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA), established by the 2008 Farm Bill. First, these research and associated extension activities focus on assisting the development of a nearshore wind farm in Rhode Island, which would lead to energy independence for the United States; one of the primary goals of NIFA and the USDA's Institute of Bioenergy, Climate, and Environment. Second, this research and extension is designed insure the sustainability of biodiversity, which is also a top priority for NIFA and IBCE.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,0224398; 596338,,,,,,,,UNIVERSITY OF RHODE ISLAND,,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:13042667,,,,,

The installation and operation of these devices can result in conflicts with wildlife. In the marine environment, mammals may avoid wind farms that are under construction or operating. Such avoidance may lead to more time spent travelling or displacement from key habitats. A paucity of data on at-sea movements of marine mammals around wind farms limits our understanding of the nature of their potential impacts. Here, we present the results of a telemetry study on harbour seals Phoca vitulina in The Wash, south-east England, an area where wind farms are being constructed using impact pile driving. We investigated whether seals avoid wind farms during operation, construction in its entirety, or during piling activity. The study was carried out using historical telemetry data collected prior to any wind farm development and telemetry data collected in 2012 during the construction of one wind farm and the operation of another. Within an operational wind farm, there was a close-to-significant increase in seal usage compared to prior to wind farm development. However, the wind farm was at the edge of a large area of increased usage, so the presence of the wind farm was unlikely to be the cause. There was no significant displacement during construction as a whole. However, during piling, seal usage (abundance) was significantly reduced up to 25 km from the piling activity; within 25 km of the centre of the wind farm, there was a 19 to 83% (95% confidence intervals) decrease in usage compared to during breaks in piling, equating to a mean estimated displacement of 440 individuals. This amounts to significant displacement starting from predicted received levels of between 166 and 178 dB re 1 muPa(p-p). Displacement was limited to piling activity; within 2 h of cessation of pile driving, seals were distributed as per the non-piling scenario. Synthesis and applications. Our spatial and temporal quantification of avoidance of wind farms by harbour seals is critical to reduce uncertainty and increase robustness in environmental impact assessments of future developments. Specifically, the results will allow policymakers to produce industry guidance on the likelihood of displacement of seals in response to pile driving; the relationship between sound levels and avoidance rates; and the duration of any avoidance, thus allowing far more accurate environmental assessments to be carried out during the consenting process. Further, our results can be used to inform mitigation strategies in terms of both the sound levels likely to cause displacement and what temporal patterns of piling would minimize the magnitude of the energetic impacts of displacement.

These novel habitats are often poor surrogates for natural habitats. The application of integrated greening of grey infrastructure (IGGI) to artificial shorelines demonstrates how multifunctional structures can provide biodiversity benefits whilst simultaneously serving their primary engineering function. IGGI is being embraced globally, despite many knowledge gaps and limitations. It is a management tool to compensate anthropogenic impacts as part of the Mitigation Hierarchy. There is considerable scope for misuse and 'greenwashing' however, by making new developments appear more acceptable, thus facilitating the regulatory process. We encourage researchers to exercise caution when reporting on small-scale experimental trials. We advocate that greater attention is paid to when experiments 'fail' or yield unintended outcomes. We advise revisiting, repeating and expanding on experiments to test responses over broader spatio-temporal scales to improve the evidence base. Synthesis and applications. Where societal and economic demand makes development inevitable, particular attention should be paid to avoiding, minimizing and rehabilitating environmental impacts. Integrated greening of grey infrastructure (IGGI) should be implemented as partial compensation for environmental damage. Mutual benefits for both humans and nature can be achieved when IGGI is implemented retrospectively in previously developed or degraded environments. We caution, however, that any promise of net biodiversity gain from new developments should be scrutinized and any local ecological benefits set in the context of the wider environmental impacts.

In fact, forecasting foundation behavior demands a correct evaluation of the combined effects of construction phasing, spatial variability of the soil mechanical properties, uncertainties on the applied loadings and due to the geomaterial mechanical modeling techniques. For offshore platforms, this is compounded by the hazardous nature of environmental loadings. These loadings, which are often very severe, could have disastrous effects on structure behavior. This dissertation presents the synthesis of a ten-year research program, developed by a team of Institut Francais du Petrole, with the cooperation of university teams, technical centers and industrial companies. The objective was to set up methodologies and numerical tools for the behavior of typical offshore structure foundations, spanning their entire life.It is presented in two distinct parts. The first part presents specific methodologies for the soil/structure interaction analysis of offshore platforms, and discusses the development of rheological models for soil behavior under non-monotonous loading. The second part considers the use of these sophisticated models for analyzing offshore structure foundations. It shows how these models are integrated in the FONDOF/IFP software, by using the finite element method coupled with algorithms specific to the problems posed by offshore foundations. Several applications are presented, demonstrating the ability of these methods to describe observed phenomena. A special place is reserved for the description of a quality assurance process developed by the French GRECO CNRS 'Geomaterials' Group of university teams, technical centers and industrial companies. The steps of a process for validating constitutive models are applied to a typical shallow foundation structure.

There is a push for getting higher levels of sustainability, leading to a differentiation of Europe's electricity market. In this differentiation, the large potential of wind energy is recognized. More specifically, North Sea countries prefer to plan wind arrays (far) out at sea. This article offers a review of the main arguments for offshore wind energy, described in comparison with its onshore counterpart. It is stated that offshore wind farms (OWFs) generate dark green electricity as they mitigate greenhouse gas emissions and contribute to the protection of (some) marine life. Applying an informational governance framework, this article further assesses whether this dark green message has been exploited through further differentiation of the electricity market, and provides an analysis of why this is not (yet) the case. It is concluded that the dominant discourse in onshore wind power development hinders a favorable ecological differentiation toward offshore wind power. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

In its indigenous habitat, C mutica is mainly found in stands of eelgrass or macroalgae in the infralittoral zone where temperature varies from -1.8 degrees C in winter to 25 degrees C in summer and salinity from I I to 35. C mutica has a high reproductive potential: there are two generations per year, females mature at a small size, are relatively fecund and reproduce more than once, and direct development of progeny ensures a good survival rate. C. mutica was introduced to North America first on the Pacific side in the early 1970s and on the Atlantic side in the late 1990s, as well as in Europe during the mid 1990s. The sites where C. mutica was introduced in the northern hemisphere are at temperate, boreal and subarctic latitudes between 35 and 70 degrees N. Transoceanic introductions probably occurred by way of transport of aquaculture organisms and ballast waters. Secondary dispersal of the species along coasts may be due to commercial and recreational navigation, drifting on floatsam, and at a smaller spatial scale by swimming and creeping. In its new habitat in the northern hemisphere, C. mutica is found mainly or only on artificial structures such as nets, ropes and buoys that are used in aquaculture. Good environmental tolerance, rapid growth and a high reproductive rate, combined with a flexible diet, an aggressive nature and a high degree of commensalism with human activities, seem to contribute to make C. mutica a good invader. C. mutica apparently has a negative impact on some aquaculture activities but its effect on natural ecosystems remains unknown.",,,,,,,,,4,0,0,0,7,0,8,,,0706-6473,0706-6473,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Quebec, ISMER, 340 Ave Ursulines, Rimouski, PQ G5L 3A1, Canada",,,,2009-01-01,BCI:BCI201000114934,,,,,

We conducted acoustic surveys along 45 transects during the post-breeding season for two years. The effect of land cover, the number of streetlamps (a proxy of artificial illumination), the presence of water bodies and weather conditions on bat activity, and community structure were investigated using Generalized Linear Mixed Models, and multivariate statistics respectively. Eight bat species and five species groups were identified. Bat communities were affected by urbanisation in general and diversity was low in the entire study area. The community was dominated by the synurbic species Pipistrellus kuhlii, which comprised more than 70% of the total bat activity recorded. A positive relationship between built-up areas and bat activity was found, probably because P. kuhlii usually forages around streetlamps in urban areas. In contrast, vegetation cover did not affect bat activity, even in the less urbanised areas.

This engineering approach to fisheries management has gained popularity in many coastal areas, including China. In Shandong province alone, over USD 50 million were invested in artificial reefs during 2005-2013. Have artificial reefs achieved their biological and economic objectives? We compared reef and control sites in terms of catch and value per unit effort and average body length across species, based on surveys carried out during 2012-2013. We found that in aggregate, with all fish and invertebrates combined, artificial reefs did not improve the overall catches or revenues. Instead, seasonal fluctuations were prominent. However, when we allow for species-specific differences and focus on the common fish species, we find that an artificial reef can increase the catch and value per unit effort on average by approximately 40% compared to the control sites. The difference between these contrasting results occurs because some of the dominant species that comprise the bulk of the catches did not benefit from the reef, while many of the less dominant ones did so. This underlines the importance of being specific about what is meant by benefiting fisheries when evaluating artificial reefs, as well as when the objectives of reef projects are formulated in the first place. The positive effects of artificial reefs can be caused by the reefs themselves and by their influence on fishing patterns. Our study was not designed to separate these effects but we suggest that in Shandong, restrictions on fishing access may have been as important as the presence of the reef itself.",,,,,,,,,9,3,0,0,7,0,10,,,1054-3139,1095-9289,,,,,,,,,,"Ocean Univ China, Coll Fisheries, 5 Yushan Rd, Qingdao 266003, Shandong, Peoples R ChinaAcad Sinica, Inst Econ, Taipei 11529, TaiwanNatl Taiwan Univ, Inst Oceanog, 1,Sec 4,Roosevelt Rd, Taipei 106, TaiwanUniv Bergen, Dept Biol, POB 7803, N-5020 Bergen, NorwayInst Marine Res, POB 1879, N-5817 Bergen, NorwayIIASA, Schlosspl 1, A-2361 Laxenburg, Austria",,,,2017-11-19,WOS:000412707000017,,,,,

In the past the deep sea has been used as a repository for sewage, dredge spoil and radioactive waste. In addition, there has been interest in the disposal of large man-made objects and, more recently, the disposal of industrially-produced carbon dioxide. Some of the materials disposed of in the deep sea may have natural analogues. This review examines natural processes in the deep sea including the vertical flux of organic material, turbidity currents and benthic storms, natural gas emissions, hydrothermal vents, natural radionuclides and rocky substrata, and compares them with anthropogenic input including sewage disposal, dredge spoil, carbon dioxide disposal, chemical contamination and the disposal of radioactive waste, wrecks and rigs.

Similar numbers of introduced species were found on both natural and artificial substrata, though the community composition was significantly different between them. We also compared the species composition of the Ilha Grande Bay survey to other inventories taken around the world. The highest similarities were found between the Ilha Grande Bay inventory and the Atlantic coastal region (Tampa Bay, USA and the Gulf of Mexico), American Samoa and Pearl Harbor (USA) inventories.Conclusions/Significance: This study presents the first published comprehensive list of hard substratum sessile marine invertebrate species in a Brazilian bay. The high percentage of cryptogenic species reveals gaps in both zoological records and information on introduced species for the Brazilian coast. The introduced species successfully colonized different sites in the Ilha Grande Bay, including both natural and artificial substrata. In addition, we find that artificial structures may not be good surrogates for natural rocky shores and may represent an ecological threat. Comparisons with other inventories suggest a history of broad-scale invasion, though more evidence is needed to support this conclusion.",,,,,,,,,39,0,0,0,39,7,41,,,1932-6203,,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Fed Rio de Janeiro, Inst Bioquim Med, Rio De Janeiro, BrazilUniv Fed Rio de Janeiro, Inst Biol, Rio De Janeiro, Brazil",,,,2010-09-29,WOS:000282269400017,20927375,,,,

More recently, they have extended these efforts through the introduction of virtual manufacturing. Virtual manufacturing makes it possible to realize an improved productivity through the use of modeling and simulation technology. As a result, it is possible to leave behind decision making based on mere intuition or past experience by establishing improved planning based on concrete quantitative data. This study newly defines a simulation modeling methodology that is suitable for the characteristics of shipbuilding. On the foundation of existing virtual manufacturing modeling methodologies, we apply the product, process, resource, and schedule (PPR-S) model, which is suitable for a shipyard production environment. A process-centric simulation modeling methodology is defined based on the process-centric nature of ship production, and a system for applying this methodology is designed.

Our study investigates whether the accumulation of epifauna, dominated by the filter feeder Mytilus edulis (blue mussel), on turbine structures affects pelagic primary productivity and ecosystem functioning in the southern North Sea. We estimate the anthropogenically increased potential distribution based on the current projections of turbine locations and reported patterns of M. edulis settlement. This distribution is integrated through the Modular Coupling System for Shelves and Coasts to state-of-the-art hydrodynamic and ecosystem models. Our simulations reveal non-negligible potential changes in regional annual primary productivity of up to 8% within the offshore wind farm area, and induced maximal increases of the same magnitude in daily productivity also far from the wind farms.

With the multi-type of vessels, multi-period, multi-base of O&M, multi-wind farm and uncertain weather conditions, the optimization of O&M cost is more challenging. In this article, a hybrid heuristic optimization of maintenance routing and scheduling for offshore wind farms is proposed. First, with the maintenance service protocol, mixed particle swarm optimization (MPSO) is applied to seek a desired mapping relation between vessels and wind farms. Utilizing the formalized rules, an optimal vessel allocation scheme is explored in the large solution space by individual crossover, swarm crossover and mutation. Then, with the scheme of vessel allocation, a discrete wolf pack search (DWPS) is introduced to optimize the maintenance route under all constraints. As the evaluation standard of MPSO, the purpose of DWPS is to search the solution space with depth and breadth balanced and find the optimal and open maintenance route with multiple round trips to bases that minimize O&M costs, including travel, technician and penalty costs. Finally, computational experiments and analysis are carried out. The results provide both the optimized cost and detailed arrangements, which can be directly used in the maintenance schedule.",,,,,,,,,25,1,0,0,0,0,27,,,0950-4230,1873-3352,,,,,,,,,,"Beihang Univ, Sch Reliabil & Syst Engn, Beijing 100191, Peoples R ChinaNorwegian Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Mech & Ind Engn, N-7034 Trondheim, Norway",,,,2019-12-24,WOS:000501613500028,,,,,

With the provision of free space, the invasive species increased its relative abundance at three sites, but did not entirely displace natives at any site.

Over the last five years, suction caissons have become the foundation of choice for anchoring deepwater floating structures (eg, SPARs, DDCVs, semis) or supporting seabed founded systems (eg, well heads, SDUs, UTAs). The installation of suction caissons induces excess pore pressures in soft soils, such as normally consolidated (NC) clays. The distribution of the excess pore pressures and their dissipation with time has a significant effect on the caisson's pullout capacity, and very few studies have been conducted on these subjects. In order to investigate the behaviour of suction caissons installed in NC clay, a series of centrifuge tests was carried out at C-CORE's centrifuge facility.

In this paper, the outcome of advanced differential InSAR processing to detect and analyze ground surface behavior due to manmade interactions are presented. An improvement was achieved in the temporal resolution and accuracy using a unique combination of both C-band and L-band SAR satellite acquisitions with different temporal and spatial baselines.

The regions undergoing downward motion are located above coal seam gas (CSG) mining sites with rates up to 28 mm/year. Three scenarios were identified: (1) extensive groundwater extraction from shallow aquifers due to CSG mining, (2) CSG mining without direct impact on groundwater resources and (3) patchy uplift over an industrial forest adjacent to a CSG mining district. Contrary to a previous study conducted in this region using the PSInSAR TM technique which reported stability of the area with insignificant surface deformation, this study shows that there are considerable deformation signals consistent with resource extraction.

With thousands of subsea structures monitored across the world's oceans from the shallows to depths greater than 1,000 m, there is a great and underutilized opportunity for their scientific use. Through slight modifications of ROV operations, and by augmenting industry workclass ROVs with a range of scientific equipment, industry can fuel scientific discoveries, contribute to an understanding of the impact of artificial structures in our oceans, and collect biotic and abiotic data to support our understanding of how oceans and marine life are changing. Here, we identify and describe operationally feasible methods to adjust the way in which industry ROVs are operated to enhance the scientific value of data that they collect, without significantly impacting scheduling or adding to deployment costs. These include: rapid marine life survey protocols, imaging improvements, the addition of a range of scientific sensors, and collection of biological samples. By partnering with qualified and experienced research scientists, industry can improve the quality of their ROV-derived data, allowing the data to be analyzed robustly. Small changes by industry now could provide substantial benefits to scientific research in the long-term and improve the quality of scientific data in existence once the structures require decommissioning. Such changes also have the potential to enhance industry's environmental stewardship by improving their environmental management and facilitating more informed engagement with a range of external stakeholders, including regulators and the public.",,,,,,,,,37,0,0,0,17,0,39,,,,2296-7745,,,,,,,,,,"Indian Ocean Marine Res Ctr, Australian Inst Marine Sci, Perth, WA, AustraliaUniv Western Australia, UWA Oceans Inst, Perth, WA, AustraliaNatl Oceanog Ctr, Southampton, Hants, EnglandLouisiana State Univ, Dept Oceanog & Coastal Sci, Coll Coast & Environm, Baton Rouge, LA 70803 USAUniv Western Australia, Sch Biol Sci, Perth, WA, AustraliaUniv Technol Sydney, Sch Life Sci, Sydney, NSW, AustraliaEnvironm Protect Author, Wellington, New ZealandCurtin Univ, Sch Mol & Life Sci, Perth, WA, AustraliaDeakin Univ, Sch Life & Environm Sci, Ctr Integrat Ecol, Burwood, Vic, AustraliaSydney Inst Marine Sci, New South Wales Dept Primary Ind, Mosman, NSW, AustraliaUniv Western Australia, Oceans Grad Sch, Perth, WA, AustraliaScottish Assoc Marine Sci, Oban, Argyll, ScotlandOcean Sci Consulting Ltd, Dunbar, ScotlandUniv Highlands & Isl, Environm Res Inst, Thurso, Scotland",Environm Protect AuthorOcean Sci Consulting Ltd,,,2020-04-23,WOS:000525472200001,,,,,

However, all the three species co-occurred in an artificial area near a breakwater.

Wind farms have certain environmental benefits, notably near-zero emissions of greenhouse gases, particulates, and other contaminants of concern. However, there are significant challenges ahead in achieving large-scale integration of wind power in the United States, particularly offshore wind. Environmental impacts from wind farms are a concern, and these are subject to a number of on-going studies focused on risks to the environment. However, once a wind farm is built, the farm itself will face a number of risks from a variety of hazards, and managing these risks is critical to the ultimate achievement of long-term reductions in pollutant emissions from clean energy sources such as wind. No integrated framework currently exists for assessing risks to offshore wind farms in the United States, which poses a challenge for wind farm risk management. In this Perspective, we provide an overview of the risks faced by an offshore wind farm, argue that an integrated framework is needed, and give a preliminary starting point for such a framework to illustrate what it might look like. This is not a final framework; substantial work remains. Our intention here is to highlight the research need in this area in the hope of spurring additional research about the risks to wind farms to complement the substantial amount of on-going research on the risks from wind farms.",,,,,,,,,17,0,0,0,0,0,19,,,0272-4332,1539-6924,,,,,,,,,,"Johns Hopkins Univ, Dept Geog & Environm Engn, Baltimore, MD 21218 USA",,,,2015-06-25,WOS:000355287900005,25691292,,,,

Tidal flow will generate a steady current, which induces a lift force and a drag force on the platform legs. In addition, water particle velocities induced by waves give rise to an oscillatory flow. As a result, the structure will experience a lift, drag and inertia force when subjected to wave-induced flow patterns. On top of that, a turbulent Von Karman vortex street can appear in the wake of the platform legs for certain combinations of dimensions and flow velocities. Vortex shedding can lead to vortex induced vibrations, which may jeopardize the integrity of the entire offshore platform.Environmental loads can cause significant deformations of offshore structures, which can in turn influence the fluid flow. Multiphysics modelling is required to capture the mechanisms governing fluid-structure interaction. In this paper, a Coupled Eulerian Lagrangian (CEL) approach is pursued to simulate offshore platform movements in strong tidal flows.In a CEL analysis, the fluid flow is modelled in an Eulerian framework: the water is described by an equation of state, and can flow freely through a fixed mesh. The offshore platform is modelled as a compliant structure in a traditional Lagrangian formulation, where the nodes move with the underlying material. Interaction between the fluid domain and the offshore structure is enforced using general contact conditions. The strongly coupled problem is then tackled with an explicit solver.Here, the CEL approach is demonstrated to simulate the movement of an offshore jack-up barge. The response of the vessel is calculated for different flow conditions. The multiphysics model allows evaluating the added value of structural redundancy, e.g. in the number of platform legs required for a safe design. In addition, it provides a valuable tool to predict the tidal windows allowed for given operational conditions.",,,,,"30th International Conference on Ocean, Offshore and Arctic Engineering30th International Conference on Ocean, Offshore and Arctic Engineering","JUN 19-24, 2011JUN 19-24, 2011","ASME, Ocean Offshore & Arctic Engn DivASME, Ocean Offshore & Arctic Engn Div","Rotterdam, NETHERLANDSRotterdam, NETHERLANDS",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,978-0-7918-4438-0,,,,,,,,,"OCAS NV, Zelzate, Belgium",,,,2011-01-01,WOS:000314793000051,,,,,

North Sea fisheries remain important to the surrounding countries despite declining fish stocks over the past decades. The main reason for declining fish stocks is nearly certainly overfishing, but other environmental pressures also affect fish populations, such as eutrophication, climate change, and exposure to metals and organic pollutants, including polyaromatic hydrocat bons (PAHs), alkylphenols, and organochlorine compounds. There are three main sources of organic pollutants in the North Sea: atmospheric, land-based sources, and inputs from offshore gas and oil installations. All three sources contribute to elevated concentrations of organic pollutants in the North Sea compared to the Norwegian Sea. There is evidence that chlorinated organic contaminants were present in sufficiently high concentrations in the southern North Sea two decades ago, to alter embryonal development in fish. The results from extensive, long-term monitoring programs show that some diseases decreased whereas other increased in the southern North Sea and that, among other factors, contaminants may play a role in the temporal changes recorded in disease prevalence.

The tidal model is a typical depth-averaged finite difference model which predicts water surface elevations, the two dimensional tide induced velocity field, the residual currents and sediment transport rates in the lagoon and its entrance/exit. The water surface elevations and the depth averaged velocities within the lagoon were evaluated numerically by solving the time dependent non-linear equations of mass and momentum, in the horizontal plane, using the alternating direct implicit finite difference scheme. The two depth integrated momentum equations were formulated to include the effects of the earth's rotation, bed resistance, turbulent diffusion and convective acceleration.The wave model is a simplified form of alongshore sediment transport models, which allows the simulation of shoreline changes under the wave action. The model formulations are simplified specifically to allow the model to be used for longer-term predictions of coastal evolution.

The consistent rise in offshore oil exploration activities in the last 2 decades has compelled structural engineers and researchers to better understand, the process of corrosion in offshore steel structures. The various electrochemical methods available for corrosion monitoring are polarization, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and electro chemical noise (ECN) techniques. In offshore industry, the reliable interpretation of electrochemical noise is particularly valuable since it promises new type of online monitoring device. This paper introduces ECN as an online corrosion-monitoring tool for marine structures. The paper discusses the laboratory experiments conducted on test specimens to collect data related to the electrochemical behavior of structural steel such as the polarization data, impedance measurements, electrochemical, potential, and current noise measurements. Investigations were carried out on MS coupons surface prepared and coated with anticorrosive and antifouling paints. An electrochemical workstation capable of collecting data from specimens coated with paint was used for noise data collection. Static corrosion tests have been done and the corrosion rate and corrosion resistance of the coatings were assessed using the statistical analysis. The electrochemical noise data were compared with that of polarization and impedance data and a good correlation between corrosion rates was obtained. The polarization and noise resistance were found to be similar in trend but with variation in numerical values. Statistical parameters like mean, standard deviation, skew, and kurtosis were generated from the obtained noise. These parameters were then processed to obtain noise resistance and corrosion rate. The results were compared with that of polarization and impedance values. The corrosion rate comparison showed a deviation of 10% from polarization with ECN giving the upper bound values. The damage prediction and expected life prediction of a steel jacket platform were also performed using the data collected. The experiments showed a good correlation between the noise resistances obtained from various electrochemical methods.

With Arctic regions containing potentially enormous oil and gas resources and with increasing accessibility and technological improvements, it is widely expected that this activity will only continue to increase in the future. At the same time, it has also been identified that there is a distinct need to develop standards specific to both onshore and offshore Arctic environments given the unique operating conditions in the Arctic and also that no standards specific to these environments yet exist.In order to address this need, in 2012 a subcommittee was established under the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) Technical Committee responsible for oil and gas offshore structures (i. e. TC 67). Specifically, ISO TC 67/SC8 has been mandated to develop standards for oil and gas operations in cold climate regions that will help ensure safe and effective Arctic oil and gas operations while also ensuring protection of the environment and the people working and living in these regions. A total of nine countries are participating in ISO/TC 67/SC8, including Canada, Russia, Norway, Great Britain, France, Italy, Netherlands, Kazakhstan, and the United States.Six different working groups have been organized under ISO TC 67/SC8 to develop standards across six distinct areas, including standards dealing with 1) the Arctic working environment, 2) escape, evacuation and rescue procedures, 3) environmental monitoring, 4) ice management, 5) material requirements, and 6) managing physical environmental data. Each working group is progressing through the successive stages of developing the standards, with the standards expected to be published as international standards by 2016 or 2017.Canadian experts are contributing to each working group under ISO TC 67/SC8, with Canada also leading the working group on ice management.

Conventional steel risers affect the deck of an offshore platform considerably due to their weight under the influence of environmental loads, impacting the fatigue and serviceability life of the structure. The study of behavior of the risers in extra critical environmental conditions could be contributory to developing the effective economical alternatives to boost up the serviceability life of the structure. To this aim, in the current study, a traditional gas export riser, oil export riser and also a thermoplastic composite pipe as a new material in offshore applications are assumed for an offshore jacket located in the North Sea. To simulate the extra critical condition, a Rogue wave has been considered. The Rogue wave with return period of 100 years has been exerted on the mentioned risers by dynamic analysis in the time domain with finite element method using ANSYS software. For an accurate analysis, two well-known wave theories including the 1st and 5th order wave theories are utilized. Afterwards, the displacements and in particular reaction forces of the mentioned risers were compared. It is shown that for gas export riser and oil export riser, 5th order wave places less force on the main deck of the offshore jacket in comparison to the 1st order wave. Also, thermoplastic composite pipe response to Rogue wave has a minimal effect on the deck structure as compared to the gas export riser and oil export riser.",,,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,,,2307-1877,2307-1885,,,,,,,,,,"Istanbul Aydin Univ, Dept Civil Engn, TR-34295 Istanbul, Turkey",,,,2016-11-24,WOS:000385260400003,,,,,

These studies investigate the feasibility that the TMD can mitigate the vibrations induced by ice forces on offshore steel jacket platforms. A TMD device was designed and manufactured with respect to an offshore oil platform. Large-scale testing is expensive and the requirements for model similarity in model-scale testing are hard to meet. Thus, an experimental technique that focuses on the control device itself and emulates the behaviour of the structure with a simulator is presented. This novel experimental system consists of a virtual part and an actual part called the semi-experimental testing system. The virtual parts include scaled external load and a scaled simplified platform model. The actual parts include the TMD device and a moving table, which is controlled by a hydraulic actuator. By introducing the interaction between the ice sheet and the structure, the performance of the device is investigated and reasons of effectiveness reduction are explained. The results show that an optimally tuned TMD can reduce the amplified response significantly under ice load action. Finally, the application possibilities of vibration absorption using TMD to other arctic offshore structures are discussed.",,,,,,,,,2,0,0,0,0,0,2,,,1475-0902,2041-3084,,,,,,,,,,"DUT State Key Lab Struct Anal Ind Equipment, Dalian, Peoples R ChinaLehigh Univ, Bethlehem, PA 18015 USA",DUT State Key Lab Struct Anal Ind Equipment,,,2008-01-01,WOS:000207603100001,,,,,

Artificial structures (piers, docks or decks) were selected at four sites in Ilha Grande and compared with natural substrates on the adjacent rocky shore by quantifying the density of each species of Tubastraea, as well as the percentage coverage of the benthic biota. The overall average density of Tubastraea tagusensis was 80.3 individuals.m(-2), about double that of T. coccinea. Both invasive species modified the structure of the invaded communities as relative abundance and richness of the species changed due to their presence. Tubastraea coccinea was more abundant on artificial substrates than on natural ones but no difference was detected in the abundance of Tubastraea tagusensis between substrates. The abundance of both species also varied with depth and site and a positive relation between artificial substratum age and abundance of the corals was observed.

The population experienced a dramatic reduction due to biocide-induced reproductive suppression in the post World War 11 era and reached an estimated low of 1,450 pairs by the early 1970s. By the mid 1990s, the population recovered to an estimated 3,500 pairs and breeding was documented on 427 of 878 named tributaries of the tidal Bay. Recovery has been exponential but spatially variable with average doubling times for defined geographic areas varying by more than an order of magnitude. Rates Of Population growth have been negatively related to salinity with the highest rates occurring within tidal fresh reaches suggesting that recovery has progressed from the main stem of the Bay toward the fall line. Virtually nothing is known about the breeding ecology of Ospreys in the lower saline waters of the Bay. The increase and diversification of man-made structures used for nesting has made a fundamental contribution to recovery and current distribution. A synthesis of information from several field sites throughout the Bay shows a collective increase in reproductive rate (young/active pair) from less than 0.8 in the 1960s to more than 1.2 by the mid-1980s followed by a reduction to below 1.0 in the late 1980s.

The model finds the optimal schedule for maintaining the turbines and the optimal routes for the crew transfer vessels to service the turbines along with the number of technicians required for each vessel. The model takes into account multiple vessels, multiple periods (days), multiple Operation & Maintenance (O&M) bases, and multiple wind farms. We develop an algorithm based on the Dantzig-Wolfe decomposition method, where a mixed integer linear program is solved for each subset of turbines to generate all feasible routes and maintenance schedules for the vessels for each period. The routes have to consider several constraints such as weather conditions, the availability of vessels, and the number of technicians available at the O&M base. An integer linear program model is then proposed to find the optimal route configuration along with the maintenance schedules that minimise maintenance costs, including travel, technician and penalty costs. The computational experiments show that the proposed optimisation model and solution method find optimal solutions to the problem in reasonable computing times. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

To further evaluate this question, the size and age of red snapper (Lutjanus campechanus) were sampled from April to November 2010 at artificial reefs south of Mobile Bay off the coast of Alabama and compared with the age of the artificial reef at the site of capture. Red snapper were collected with hook and line and a fish trap and visually counted during scuba-diver surveys. In the laboratory, all captured red snapper were weighed and measured, and the otoliths were removed for aging. The mean age of red snapper differed significantly across reefs of different ages, with older reefs having older fish. The mean age of red snapper at a particular reef was not related to reef depth or distance to other reefs. The positive correlation between the mean age of red snapper and the age of the reef where they were found supports the contention that artificial reefs in the northern Gulf of Mexico enhance production of red snapper.

Studies of artificial reefs have focused predominantly on fish assemblages and have largely disregarded the development of sessile biota and their structural and functional relationships.

Thousands of fixed platforms and associated equipment have been installed on the Gulf of Mexico continental shelf, leading to a pervasive 'ocean sprawl.' After decommissioning, 100s of these structures have been converted to artificial reefs under the federal 'Rigs-to-Reefs' program, in addition to artificial reefs specifically designed to enhance fisheries and/or benefit the recreational diving industry. Apart from a few natural banks, which reach to approximately 55 ft below the surface, artificial reefs provide the only shallow-water hard substrate for benthic organisms in the deeper waters of the northern Gulf of Mexico. This vast expansion in available habitat has almost exclusively occurred over a relatively short span of time (similar to 50 years). The ecological interactions of artificial and natural reefs in the northern Gulf of Mexico are complex. Artificial reefs in general, and oil and gas structures in particular, have often been invoked as stepping stones for non-native and invasive species (e.g., Tubastrea cup corals, lionfish). The pilings are covered with fouling communities which remain largely unstudied. While the risks of these fouling organisms for invading natural reefs are being broadly discussed, other impacts on the ecological and economic health of the Gulf of Mexico, such as the potential to facilitate jellyfish blooms or increase the incidence of ciguatera fish poisoning, have received less attention. Artificial reefs also provide ecosystem services, particularly as habitat for economically important fish species like red snapper. Here we revisit the potential role of artificial reefs as 'stepping stones' for species invasions and for fisheries enhancement. Beyond concerns about ecological effects, some of these topics also raise public health concerns.

This paper explores the factors that affect stakeholders' (traditional ocean users, including fishers and aquaculture farmers) acceptance and conducts an empirical analysis to determine the relationship among stakeholders' perceptions and acceptance. A total of 238 respondents completed a survey that was conducted in six coastal counties in western Taiwan. We used principle component analysis and two logistic regression models for the analysis: one model does not consider perception factors, while the other model estimates perception factors. The empirical results reveal that three perception factors related to the benefits of offshore wind farms significantly affect stakeholders' acceptance. Furthermore, the explanatory power, goodness-of-fit, and the predicted probability are greater when perception factors are considered in the logistic model. As a result, stakeholders' perceptions are important factors that influence their acceptance of OWFs along the western coast of Taiwan. According to our findings, recommendations are offered to resolve the user conflicts regarding OWF turbine construction and operation, including (1) communicating effectively and integrating stakeholder participation and (2) offering benefits to ocean users and local communities.

Here, we propose a specific method for this purpose. A total of 140 long-lines were monitored on a mussel culture ground in the French Mediterranean Sea during four experimental surveys deploying multibeam sonar devices mounted on poles (Reson Seabat 6012, 455 kHz) on small boats. This allowed geo-referenced observations to be made of the submerged mussel long-lines, as well as three-dimensional (3D) drawings of the long-line structures and the sea bed shapes, using long-line longitudinal sonar sampling. Three sonar data-analysis methods were applied: (i) direct two-dimensional (2D) visual interpretation of raw sonar video images; (ii) indirect 2D long-line drawings; and (iii) 3D digital long-line reconstructions. The development of these acoustic methods in shallow water provides scientists, managers and local authorities with a tool for observing the 3D position (geographical position and depth) of mussel cultures, for counting each structure by the 'long-line echo-counting' method, for monitoring their shape in situ, and for classifying the mussel rope segments into three growth categories ('in growth', 'full' and 'empty'). The use of acoustic tools for monitoring underwater mussel culture grounds, for management purposes and for scientific studies, could be extended to other artificial structures in shallow water environments.

The present study synthesizes the current state of understanding on the effects of offshore wind farms on marine wildlife, in order to identify general versus local conclusions in published studies. The results were translated into a generalized impact assessment for coastal waters in Sweden, which covers a range of salinity conditions from marine to nearly fresh waters. Hence, the conclusions are potentially applicable to marine planning situations in various aquatic ecosystems. The assessment considered impact with respect to temporal and spatial extent of the pressure, effect within each ecosystem component, and level of certainty. Research on the environmental effects of offshore wind farms has gone through a rapid maturation and learning process, with the bulk of knowledge being developed within the past ten years. The studies showed a high level of consensus with respect to the construction phase, indicating that potential impacts on marine life should be carefully considered in marine spatial planning. Potential impacts during the operational phase were more locally variable, and could be either negative or positive depending on biological conditions as well as prevailing management goals. There was paucity in studies on cumulative impacts and long-term effects on the food web, as well as on combined effects with other human activities, such as the fisheries.

Ecological risk assessments (ERAs) of marine biodiversity are often used to prioirtise issues but only give broad guidance of how issues might be addressed in the form of strategies. However, at small and regional spatial scales marine natural resource managers have to make decisions within these strategies about how to manage specific interactions between human uses and ecological components. By using the transition between risk characterization and risk treatment in ERA for marine biodiversity tractable ways through the complexity can be found. This paper will argue that specific management and research actions relevant to smaller spatial scales can be developed by using the linkage between risk factors and risk treatment in ERA. Many risk factors require risk treatments that extend beyond the boundary of local agencies or sector responsibilities. The risk factor-treatment platform provides a practical way that these boundaries can be opened up by providing a scientifically based and transparent process to engage all actors who need to be involved in addressing the issues raised by an ERA. First, the principles of the mechanism will be described. Second, how the mechanism is constructed will be introduced using examples from an urban estuary. Application of the mechanism reveals three different types of risk factors (stressor, ecological, and knowledge gap) that can be used to develop specific management and research actions to treat risks. The systematic approach enables the dual complexities of marine ecosystems and multiple human pressures to be unravelled to identify and target issues effectively. The risk factor treatment linkage provides a platform to negotiate and develop effective management and research actions across jurisdictional, disciplinary, community and stakeholder boundaries.",,,,,,,,,11,0,0,0,5,0,12,,,1054-3139,1095-9289,,,,,,,,,,"Fisheries NSW, Dept Primary Ind, Wollongong, NSW 2520, Australia",,,,2015-04-22,WOS:000351837500032,,,,,

Recently, for economic reasons, the need for extending the lifetime of existing offshore structures led to the necessity of developing more accurate and realistic predicting models so that damage detection and maintenance can be optimized. This paper proposes the implementation of Structural Health Monitoring Systems in order to extract modal properties-such as mode shapes, natural frequencies, and damping ratios-throughout Operational Modal Analysis (OMA), which is the engineering field that studies the modal properties of systems under ambient vibrations or normal operating conditions. The identified modal properties of the structural system are the fundamental information to update a finite element model by means of an expansion technique. Then, the virtual sensing technique-modal expansion-is used to estimate the stress in the entire structure. Though existing models depend on the load estimation, the model based on OMA-assisted virtual sensing depends on the measured responses and assumes that the loads act as random vibrations. A case study using data from a real offshore structure is presented based on measurements recorded during normal operation conditions of an offshore tripod jacket. From strains estimated using OMA and virtual sensing, fatigue stresses are predicted and verified by applying the concept of equivalent stress range. Both estimated and measured strains are given as input data to evaluate the equivalent stress range and compared with each other. Based on this study, structural health monitoring estimates the fatigue stresses with high precision. As conclusion, this study describes how the fatigue can be assessed based on a more accurate value of stress and less uncertainties, which may allow extending the fatigue life of offshore platforms.",,,,,,,,,8,1,0,0,0,0,9,,,1070-9622,1875-9203,,,,,,,,,,"Tech Univ Denmark, Dept Civil Engn, Brovej 118, DK-2800 Lyngby, DenmarkAarhus Univ, Dept Engn, Inge Lehmanns Gade 10, DK-8000 Aarhus, DenmarkRamboll Oil & Gas, Dept Marine Struct, Bavnehoj 5, DK-6700 Esbjerg, Denmark",Ramboll Oil & Gas,,,2020-06-29,WOS:000540533600002,,,,,

As a result, it forms very dense and chemically durable concrete to withstand the harsh and corrosive chemical environments.The results of detailed investigations on concrete made from type V cement with addition of micro silica as substituent and its curing by tap water shows dramatic increase is compressive strength (CS) of concrete after 7 days of hydration onwards. By repeating experiment in sodium sulfate solutions (50 gr/lit) prepared under ASTM C1012 requirements, the results were same as tap water but the extend of increase of compressive strength is lower. It is also confirmed that, micro silica modies pore size distribution and permeability of type V cement concreats in same way as reported for ordinary Portlant cement in various literature.

J,,,,,,,,,Tim Bedford,,Mathematical tools for improving the understanding of uncertainty in offshore turbine operation and maintenance,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Awarded Grant,Mar 31 2011,2011,"The UK is planning to make massive investments in offshore wind farms which will result in several fleets of similar wind turbines being installed around the UK coastline. The economic case for these wind turbines assumes a very high technical availability, which means simply that the turbines have to be working and ready to generate electricity for nearly all of the time. Not achieving this availability could well result in large economic losses. Unfortunately there is relatively little operational experience of offshore systems on which to base the estimates used. The systems may turn out to behave in unexpected ways by failing earlier than expected, or by proving more difficult to maintain. Even well-known systems can behave differently when used in new environments, which is why reliability databases often indicate ranges of failure behaviour rather than single number estimates. Availability is difficult to model because, in addition to the unknown impact of different environments, there is often a period of adjustment in which operators and manufacturers adapt their processes and systems to the new situation, leading to the potential for availability growth. However, with a new fleet of turbines there is also an aging process as they all grow older together which could lead to lower availability. The economic case for offshore systems depends a lot on whether high enough availability can be achieved, particularly in the early years of operation which are important for paying back the investment costs. This project looks at the degree of uncertainty there is in availability estimates for offshore wind turbines. This uncertainty is not one that averages out when there are a large number of turbines, because it has a systematic affect across all the turbines in a wind farm and therefore leads to corresponding uncertainty in the overall availability across the wind farm. This type of uncertainty is often called state-of-knowledge uncertainty and only gets reduced by collecting data over the longer term. Even if we are not yet able to collect operational data, we can still gain an understanding of the sources of state-of-knowledge uncertainty. Mathematical models can help us understand how different sources of uncertainty affect the uncertainty about availability, and to find out which ones we should be most concerned about. That, in turn, will help researchers to focus their energies on resolving the issues that ultimately have the biggest impact.In this project, operations researchers will work together with engineers and other researchers in the renewables sector, in order to build credible mathematical models to help answer these questions. Doing that requires the development of new mathematics, particularly in the way we represent how uncertainties are affected by different environmental and engineering aspects. It requires us to find better ways of getting information from experts into a form that we can use in the mathematical models, and it also requires us to find new ways of running the models on a computer.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,EP/I017380/1,,,,,,,,University of Strathclyde,,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:15394753,,,,,

This study tested hypotheses about effects of epibiota on abundances of fishes associated with pilings in Middle Harbour, Sydney. Amount of epibiota had no effect on abundances of most species of fish, suggesting that epibiota are not important resources for these species. Abundances of the hulafish, Trachinops taeniatus, were, however, found to be greater around pilings with large than pilings with small amounts of epibiota at one site, at each of two times. Experimental removals of epibiota from pilings were done to test the hypothesis that epibiota are an important resource to T. taeniatus. Despite great temporal fluctuations in abundances over the duration of the experiment, the response of T. taeniatus to the removal of epibiota from pilings was as predicted, falling to zero following removal of epibiota. Although this suggests that epibiota are an important resource for this species, this pattern was spatially and temporally variable.

The nonlinear effects due to large displacements, large rotations and high environmental forces are of prime importance in the analysis. This paper investigates the structural response of a 580 m high multi-hinged articulated tower under different seismic sea environment in a water depth of 545 m. The articulated tower is represented as an upright flexible pendulum supported on the sea-bed by a mass-less rotational spring of zero stiffness while the top of it rigidly supports a deck in the air; a concentrated mass above still water level (SWL). For computation of seismic loads, the tower is idealized as a stick model of finite elements with masses lumped at the nodes. The earthquake response is carried out by time history analysis using real sets of Californian earthquakes. Disturbed water particle kinematics due to seismic shaking of sea bed is taken into consideration. Nonlinear dynamic equation of motion is formulated using Lagrangian approach. The approach is based on energy principle that relates the kinetic energy, potential energy and work of the system in terms of rotational degree-of-freedom. The solution to the equation of motion is obtained by Newmark-beta scheme in the time domain that counters the nonlinearities associated with the system in an iterative fashion. It is observed that with the increase in water depth, additional hinges are required to compensate the increased bending moment due to additional earthquake loads. Analysis results are compared and presented in the form of time-histories and PSDFs of various responses along with combined responses due to horizontal and vertical component of ground motion using direct sum and SRSS method.",,,,,"28th International Conference on Ocean, Offshore and Arctic Engineering28th International Conference on Ocean, Offshore and Arctic Engineering","MAY 31-JUN 05, 2009MAY 31-JUN 05, 2009","ASME, Ocean, Offshore & Arctic Engn DivASME, Ocean, Offshore & Arctic Engn Div","Honolulu, HIHonolulu, HI",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,978-0-7918-4341-3,,,,,,,,,"Jamia Millia Islamia, Dept Civil Engn, New Delhi 110025, India",,,,2009-01-01,WOS:000283007400033,,,,,

In order to protect and enhance the growth of settling communities, artificial monolithic reefs were deployed close to the most important formations, providing further nesting sites and mechanical hindrance to illegal trawl fishing.In this framework, a multi-step and multi-scale numerical modelling activity was carried out to predict the perturbations induced by the presence of artificial structures on sediment transport over the outcroppings and their implications on turbidity and water quality. After having characterized wave and current circulation climate at the sub-basin scale over a reference year, a set of small scale simulations was carried out to describe the effects of a single monolith under different geometries and hydrodynamic forcings, encompassing the conditions likely occurring at the study sites. A dedicated tool was then developed to compose the information contained in the small-scale database into realistic deployment configurations, and applied in four protected outcroppings identified as test sites. With reference to these cases, under current meteomarine climate the application highlighted a small and localised increase in suspended sediment concentration, suggesting that the implemented deployment strategy is not likely to produce harmful effects on turbidity close to the outcroppings.In a broader context, the activity is oriented at the tuning of a flexible instrument for supporting the decision-making process in benthic environments of outstanding environmental relevance, especially in the Integrated Coastal Zone Management or Maritime Spatial Planning applications.

The evidence for anthropogenically induced climate change is overwhelming with the production of greenhouse gases from burning fossil fuels being a key driver. In response, many governments have initiated programmes of energy production from renewable sources.2. The marine environment presents a relatively untapped energy source and offshore installations are likely to produce a significant proportion of future energy production. Wind power is the most advanced, with development of wave and tidal energy conversion devices expected to increase worldwide in the near future.3. Concerns over the potential impacts on biodiversity of marine renewable energy installations (MREI) include: habitat loss, collision risks, noise and electromagnetic fields. These factors have been posited as having potentially important negative environmental impacts.4. Conversely, we suggest that if appropriately managed and designed, MREI may increase local biodiversity and potentially benefit the wider marine environment. Installations have the capacity to act as both artificial reefs and fish aggregation devices, which have been used previously to facilitate restoration of damaged ecosystems, and de facto marine-protected areas, which have proven successful in enhancing both biodiversity and fisheries.5. The deployment of MREI has the potential to cause conflict among interest groups including energy companies, the fishing sector and environmental groups. Conflicts should be minimized by integrating key stakeholders into the design, siting, construction and operational phases of the installations, and by providing clear evidence of their potential environmental benefits.6. Synthesis and applications. MREI have the potential to be both detrimental and beneficial to the environment but the evidence base remains limited. To allow for full biodiversity impacts to be assessed, there exists an urgent need for additional multi and inter-disciplinary research in this area ranging from engineering to policy. Whilst there are a number of factors to be considered, one of the key decisions facing current policy makers is where installations should be sited, and, dependent upon site, whether they should be designed to either minimize negative environmental impacts or as facilitators of ecosystem restoration.",,,,,,,,,298,0,0,0,145,0,327,,,0021-8901,1365-2664,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Exeter, Ctr Ecol & Conservat, Penryn TR10 9EZ, Cornwall, EnglandUniv Exeter, Sch Biosci, PRIMaRE, Penryn TR10 9EZ, Cornwall, EnglandUniv Plymouth, Marine Biol & Ecol Res Ctr, PRIMaRE, Plymouth PL4 8AA, Devon, EnglandUniv Plymouth, Inst Marine, Plymouth PL4 8AA, Devon, England",,,,2009-12-01,WOS:000272193300002,,,,,

We review post-construction studies of seabirds at 20 OWFs in European waters to extract and classify evidence for displacement or attraction of 33 different seabird species. Divers and northern gannets showed consistent and strong avoidance behaviour/displacement, and this may also be the case for great crested grebe and northern fulmar. Long-tailed duck, common scoter, Manx shearwater, razorbill, common guillemot, little gull and sandwich tern showed less consistent displacement from OWFs. Several gull species and red-breasted merganser showed weak attraction, while great cormorant and European shag showed strong attraction to OWFs. Other species show little response. Displacement seems mainly to be due to bird responses to OWF structures and appears stronger when turbines are rotating, but could in part be due to boat traffic to and from OWFs. Attraction of cormorants relates at least impart to their use of structures for roosting and for drying plumage, but increases in food availability at OWFs appears to be an important influence for several species.

Early-stage wave energy concepts are often planned for deployment in shallow to intermediate water depths, where the traditional catenary systems are insufficient, and have experienced several failures due to large line loads. As a result, considerable amount. of line and anchor material is often required and causes undesirably high mooring cost. A need for applying more novel systems and materials is present in order to increase durability and decrease the cost. This study focusses on three different mooring systems, which have been considered in earlier studies and makes direct comparison between the lifetime cost using existing cost databases and design procedures stated in design standards from certification companies. All systems are primarily composed of synthetic lines, and are designed using validated numerical models together with a surrogate based optimization routine.

However, little practical guidance exists to help structure and implement such an approach. This paper outlines the linkages between ecosystems, ES and EBM in a practical framework that could be applied to marine environmental management. Using the northwestern, deepwater Gulf of Mexico as a case study, a three-stage approach was devised: (1) prioritizing relevant ES according to perceived financial and societal value and level of stress, (2) assessing the effectiveness of a wide range of indicators of ES health, and (3) ranking indicators to identify those whose monitoring would be most effective in tracking ES health. The first stage of this approach identified food provision, recreational fishing, and the non-use ethical value derived from the presence of iconic species as the highest-priority ES in the case study region. The second and third stages suggested four indicators as having the highest priority for supporting key ES: (1) levels of selected chemical compounds in key species of fish, (2) marine sound, (3) concentration of chlorophyll-a as a proxy for phytoplankton, and (4) economic and ecological values added by artificial structures. Results of this study will be helpful in prioritizing the allocation of resources for marine environmental monitoring. The approach described here will also be applicable, with appropriate adaptations, to ES analysis in other environmental settings. (C) 2014 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

The scientific goal was to develop a mathematical model for efficiency in the design, manufacture, use and management of offshore wind power. The papers practical purpose is the experimental designation of the impact of selected post-use management methods, time of use and maritime location, i.e. average annual productivity of wind power plants on the efficiency of energy benefits from greenhouse gas emissions. The mathematical model of the integrated cost-benefit ratio has been developed for energy use assessment, taking into account the benefits generated by electricity production and the life-cycle CO2 emissions based on the LCA analysis using the CML method. Mathematical model validation was performed by determining the value of the indicator for an existing 2 MW offshore wind farm and comparatively for fossil fuel production: lignite, stone, fuel oil and natural gas. Analytical and research work carried out showed that the higher the efficiency index, the higher the value of the indicator. It has been shown that the location of the power station at sea produces more favorable CO2 elimination rates, due to higher productivity compared to in-land wind power plants. A more favorable form of post-consumer management for CO2 has been determined as recycling.

Fish assemblages were monitored for species composition, abundance, and fish size, and compared to two natural control sites. We censused 127 species (107,168 fishes) from artificial reefs, 93 species (16,495 fishes) on natural control reefs, and 17 species (1,040 fishes) on sand bottom from July 1987 to March 1989. Artificial reefs supported a diverse, abundant, and dynamic assemblage of fishes that were a mixture of species found in surrounding sand and natural reef habitats. Colonization (number of species, individuals, and biomass) was very rapid. Abundance varied seasonally with recruitment episodes tending to occur in the spring and summer followed by losses for the remainder of the year. Assemblages were quite variable on and between similar sized reefs. Fish and biomass densities were higher at artificial reefs than on sand and natural reefs. Resident fish biomass varied less than resident fish numbers, because individual growth compensated for mortality after recruitment episodes. Reef size significantly influenced total numbers of species, individuals, and biomass. Smaller reefs had greater fish density while larger reefs had higher biomass density from larger but fewer, individuals. Multiple small reefs supported more individuals and more species than one large reef of equal material. Fishes recruited by larval settlement accounted far 36% of the total resident abundance but only 2% of total biomass. As reef size increased, older juvenile or adult colonists comprised a greater percentage of total biomass (94% to 99%). Assemblage importance percentages (based on abundance, biomass, and frequency) were divided between residents (64%), visitors (20%), and transients (16%). Economically important species comprised 61% of the biomass and 55% of the individuals, among which settlers accounted for 94.3% of individuals but only 5.7% of their total biomass. The most highly valued species were visitors or residents that utilized the reefs after first settling elsewhere. These results showed that data on artificial reef assemblages based solely on the abundance of resident species are biased. Data on visitors, transients, frequency-of-occurrence, and biomass are important in evaluating bias.

The approach mainly focuses on how icebreakers or offshore installation disconnection capabilities may alter ice-load distributions and thereby reduce the probability of failure. To demonstrate the approach, a moored symmetrical structure in the central Barents Sea was considered. Realistic ice data from a probabilistic ice-drift simulator was used as a basis and ice loads were calculated in hourly time steps for a 1000-year period. The load calculations were based on the transformation of all developing ice conditions into a standardized equivalent ice thickness. Furthermore, empirical formulations for ice resistance on icebreaking vessels were combined with max-to-mean ratios from physical tank-model tests to estimate peak loads. The demonstration reveals a need for more relevant ice-load models that are valid both for managed as well as unmanaged ice. The methodology used for the calculation of ice equivalency and ice loads significantly underestimates the loads from severe ice features (compared to approaches recommended in ISO 19906). In a severe ice environment, it was found that the icebreaker's ability to reduce ice loads was insufficient to reduce the most extreme (abnormal) loads. The ability to disconnect moorings and risers and escape the site prior to abnormal ice events will ensure that the ice loads are within an acceptable range, conditional that the disconnection capabilities are sufficiently reliable. A fault-tree analysis including failure probabilities in ice-management operations and/or disconnection operations is considered useful for estimating the frequency of specified accidents.

Observational studies are needed to improve understanding of faunal assemblages supported by offshore infrastructure and better predict the effect of removal. Here, we present results from visual inspection and physical sampling of a small oil and gas industry structure decommissioned from an oil field in the North East Atlantic. This is supported by observations of similar structures nearby and by photographs of the surrounding seabed from environmental baseline surveys. The structure supported a reasonably high biomass and diversity of invertebrates (10 kg and 39 macrofaunal and 17 megafaunal species) and fishes (20 kg biomass and 4 species). The invertebrate megafaunal species present on the structure were a sub-set of the hard substratum fauna observed on surrounding seabed. Porifera were absent from the structure. Biological succession in the first 2 years occurred as follows. Sparse colonies of the hydroid Obelia sp. stet were early colonisers then subsequent development of thick hydroid turf (Obelia sp. stet. and Halecium sp. stet.) supported an invertebrate assemblage (2654 individuals kg wet mass -1 ) dominated by saddle oysters [Pododesmus squama (Gmelin, 1791) and Heteranomia sp. stet.)] and scale worms (Harmothoe spp.). Percentage cover of hydroid turf varied significantly over the structure, with most growth on sections exposed to strongest currents. Commercially important fish species present around the structure included Gadus morhua (Atlantic cod), Pollachius virens (saithe) and Lophius piscatorius (monkfish). Studies of artificial structures such as this provide much needed data to understand their role in the ecology of seafloor habitats and inform environmental decision making on all stages of industry from exploration to decommissioning. We show that the ecological role of the decommissioned three-dimensional structures was to enhance the biomass of a sub-set of epifaunal invertebrates found in the area.

This study proposes the five components for multi-purpose ship and ocean simulators based on the requirements to overcome such limitations. The first component is the environment, including display such as a 360-degree surround screen and HMDs (Head-Mounted Displays), and a motion generator such as a 6DOF motion platform, a motion chair, and a treadmill. The second is the controller such as button, lever, joystick and wand which can capture the motion of the hand. The third is a background software to calculate the motion or to implement the control logic. The fourth is virtual reality, including realistic contents. The last one is integrated technology through the network, which can incorporate the components at once. We construct OSC (Ocean Simulation Center) based on five components listed above.

The marine algal succession in the artificial reefs was as follows: in January of 2016, two months after the reef installment, only Ulva spp. and non-geniculated coralline algae were found. Ten months after installment, non-geniculated coralline algae were dominant; however, perennial Ecklonia cava continued to grow robustly. During the 2 years of monitoring, Ecklonia cava and Grateloupia elliptica were the dominant species growing on the artificial reefs. During the earlier stages post-installment, short-lived annual marine algae attached and grew on the reefs; however, as time progressed, the algal succession pattern changed to perennial marine algal dominance. In this study with artificial reefs, from the early stages post reef installment, various marine algal succession were observed in stages, and after normal structured communities were formed, a large perennial brown algae colony attached to the reef and formed a stable community.

The prospect of large, unclaimed ocean spaces has encouraged people to consider developing sea-going settlements. A number of attempts have been made on former oil platforms or cruise ships. But these structures are not designed for permanent living at sea and fall short of meeting dwellers' expectations. Efforts to build large, spacious floating living facilities have struggled to balance cost-effectiveness and structural integrity.This paper describes an innovative, cost-efficient solution to maximize space on offshore structures. To control the cost, the submerged volume of the floater is minimized. To maximize comfort, the available living surface area is also maximized, while the motions of the platform are limited. The proposed solution is based on the principles of tensegrity, which are commonly used on bridges. Cable stays are tensioned at the top of towers to support the weight of both light and cantilevered top-sides. The floater is column-stabilized with four submerged columns.A feasibility study was performed for the design of a Clubstead based off the coast of California. The platform is dynamically positioned and can house up to 270 people. Due to its primary function, as a floating living facility, the architectural design and the engineering studies are intertwined. Iterations are necessary to determine the global characteristics of the ClubStead. The buildings and living spaces are arranged by an architect, within specific offshore-related constraints. The resulting payload is calculated and thus used in the design basis to perform the engineering analysis. The feasibility study focuses on survivability and passenger comfort to assess the novel design. The survivability analysis is based on structural strength and motion predictions in a 100-year storm. Passenger comfort is evaluated in operational conditions.",,,,,"29th ASME International Conference on Ocean, Offshore and Arctic Engineering29th ASME International Conference on Ocean, Offshore and Arctic Engineering","JUN 06-11, 2010JUN 06-11, 2010","ASME, Ocean, Offshore, & Arctic Engn DivASME, Ocean, Offshore, & Arctic Engn Div","Shanghai, PEOPLES R CHINAShanghai, PEOPLES R CHINA",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,978-0-7918-4909-5,,,,,,,,,"Marine Innovat & Technol, Berkeley, CA USA",Marine Innovat & Technol,,,2010-01-01,WOS:000290548800021,,,,,

Wind farm lifetimes involve 40-50-year commitments, including site surveys, construction, operation, and eventual decommissioning. Because their areas often overlap with essential fisheries habitats, there is a need to understand, mitigate, and manage offshore wind farm impacts on fisheries and ecosystems. Activities during all phases of wind farm lifetimes produce underwater sound, a concern because high noise levels and/or persistent anthropogenic noise can impact marine life in many ways. Here, we review the current understanding of impacts of wind energy activities on fisheries resources, taking into account the varied noise conditions that occur from site survey to decommissioning. For certain portions of wind farm development, such as construction and operation, there is a small amount of available data that allows stakeholders to evaluate impacts for at least some taxa. Yet, we are data deficient for most species' populations, life stages, and other phases as they relate to wind farm development. Thus, it is difficult to evaluate impacts with any certainty, underscoring the need for further studies to adequately address impacts of offshore wind farms on vulnerable and ecologically and economically important taxa.",,,,,,,,,32,1,0,0,16,0,32,,,1042-8275,,,,,,,,,,,"Woods Hole Oceanog Inst, Dept Biol, Woods Hole, MA 02543 USASwedish Def Res Agcy, Dept Underwater Res, Stockholm, SwedenWoods Hole Oceanog Inst, Woods Hole, MA 02543 USAUniv Waikato, Sch Sci, Hamilton, New Zealand",,,,2021-02-03,WOS:000606322400012,,,,,

In particular, techniques that use habitat restoration alone or restoration in combination with built infrastructure to provide coastal protective services are growing in popularity. These novel approaches, often called living shorelines, have the potential to expand the reach and applicability of coastal restoration projects. To understand how living shorelines research has expanded over time, we conducted a scoping review of English-language peer-reviewed articles. We included papers that self-identified as living shorelines research, as well as studies that used other related terminology, to investigate trends in publication rates, geography, site characteristics, and outcomes measured. Using a systematic search protocol, we compiled a database of 46 papers; the earliest study was published in 1981, and the earliest study to use the term living shoreline was published in 2008. Eighty-three percent of studies were conducted in North America, followed by 11% in Asia, and 7% in Europe, but the use of the term living shoreline was almost exclusively restricted to North America. Saltmarshes, oyster reefs, mangroves, and freshwater vegetation were used in living shoreline designs, but 91% of studies also incorporated structural materials like oyster shell and rock. Most living shorelines research was conducted at sites that were <5 years old. The vast majority of studies exclusively reported on ecological outcomes (89%), and of those, ecological processes were measured in 74% of studies. Processes related to coastal protection were measured most frequently (52% of ecological studies), followed by biological interactions, water filtration, nutrient cycling, and carbon sequestration. Altogether, our data suggest that living shorelines research is on the rise, but there is a need for more long-term data, socio-economic research, further consensus on the terminology used to describe different types of projects, and research on the types of living shorelines that are most effective in different environmental contexts. Future long-term and interdisciplinary research will help to elucidate the full effects of living shorelines.",,,,,,,,,37,1,0,0,20,0,51,,,,2296-7745,,,,,,,,,,"Duke Univ, Marine Lab, Nicholas Sch Environm, Beaufort, NC 28516 USAEast Carolina Univ, Dept Biol, Greenville, NC 27858 USAEast Carolina Univ, Coastal Studies Inst, Greenville, NC 27858 USA",,,,2020-06-23,WOS:000539227100001,,,,,

In the Netherlands, an extensive monitoring programme is being executed at the first offshore wind farm (Offshore Windfarm Egmond aan Zee, OWEZ). This letter compiles the short-term (two years) results on a large number of faunal groups obtained so far. Impacts were expected from the new hard substratum, the moving rotor blades, possible underwater noise and the exclusion of fisheries. The results indicate no short-term effects on the benthos in the sandy area between the generators, while the new hard substratum of the monopiles and the scouring protection led to the establishment of new species and new fauna communities. Bivalve recruitment was not impacted by the OWEZ wind farm. Species composition of recruits in OWEZ and the surrounding reference areas is correlated with mud content of the sediment and water depth irrespective the presence of OWEZ. Recruit abundances in OWEZ were correlated with mud content, most likely to be attributed not to the presence of the farm but to the absence of fisheries. The fish community was highly dynamic both in time and space. So far, only minor effects upon fish assemblages especially near the monopiles have been observed. Some fish species, such as cod, seem to find shelter inside the farm. More porpoise clicks were recorded inside the farm than in the reference areas outside the farm. Several bird species seem to avoid the park while others are indifferent or are even attracted. The effects of the wind farm on a highly variable ecosystem are described. Overall, the OWEZ wind farm acts as a new type of habitat with a higher biodiversity of benthic organisms, a possibly increased use of the area by the benthos, fish, marine mammals and some bird species and a decreased use by several other bird species.",,,,,,,,,162,3,0,0,95,0,180,,,1748-9326,,,,,,,,,,,"IMARES, NL-1790 AD Den Burg, NetherlandsNoordzeeWind, NL-1976 CE Ijmuiden, NetherlandsRoyal NIOZ, NL-1790 AB Den Burg, NetherlandsBur Waardenburg, NL-4100 AJ Culemborg, NetherlandsIMARES, NL-1970 AB Ijmuiden, Netherlands",NoordzeeWindBur Waardenburg,,,2011-07-01,WOS:000295327900041,,,,,

In this paper, CFD (Computational Fluid Dynamics) prediction for wave loads acting on a bergy bit around a fixed offshore platform is presented. Often the vertical column of a gravity based structure is designed against ice collisions, if operating in such an environment. In practices, topsides are usually protected by being placed sufficiently high from the still water level, away from the reach of the bergy bits. This vertical clearance between the still water level and the topside deck is known an air gap. Hence, the amount of the air gap planned for such an offshore structure is an important factor for the safety of the topsides at a given location. In this study a CFD method is applied to estimate the dynamic response of the bergy bit and provide a reliable air gap to reduce the potential risk of the bergy bit collision. In advance of more complex collision simulations using a free-floating ice for the airgap design, CFD analysis of wave load prediction on a stationary bergy bit is carried out and reported in this paper. In the experiments and CFD simulations, the location of the bergy bit is changed to quantify the change of wave load due to the hydrodynamic interaction between the bergy bit and the platform.

To mitigate these impacts, eco-engineering efforts have focussed on increasing the physical and biogenic complexity of artificial structures, in the form of crevices added to seawalls and the seeding of the substrate with habitat-forming organisms such as oysters. While these studies have assessed how these interventions affect epibenthic assemblages, the effect of these strategies on the behaviour, such as feeding and habitat use, of different functional groups of fish (e.g. cryptobenthic and pelagic) remains uncertain. To do this, we manipulated complexity on seawalls by adding concrete tiles with different physical (flat or structured with crevices and ridges) and biogenic (seeding with two common habitat-forming species or naturally recruited fouling) complexities. We assessed pelagic and cryptobenthic fish species composition, abundance, interaction time with the tiles and number of feeding bites on three occasions 8-12 months after deployment. Cryptobenthic fish interacted more with physically complex tiles than flat tiles, regardless of biogenic complexity. In contrast, cryptobenthic fish fed more from flat tiles compared to physically complex tiles, and also appeared to feed more from tiles seeded with oysters. Pelagic fish interacted and fed more from naturally fouled tiles compared to unfouled control tiles, regardless of physical complexity. This study showed that manipulating complexity at the scales used here affects behaviour of fish, but it does not affect fish community. Increasing physical complexity facilitated fish use of seawalls as habitat by providing refuge, while it also hindered fish feeding by providing refuge for their prey. Cryptobenthic fish are important trophic linkages in their ecosystems and we have shown that by changing habitat complexity, we can change the habitat use and feeding activity of these fish, allowing them to fulfil this essential ecosystem role.",,,,,,,,,14,0,0,0,12,0,15,,,0925-8574,1872-6992,,,,,,,,,,"Univ New South Wales, Sch Biol Earth & Environm Sci, Evolut & Ecol Res Ctr, Sydney, NSW, AustraliaSydney Inst Marine Sci, Mosman, NSW 2088, AustraliaUniv Sydney, Sch Life & Environm Sci, Sydney, NSW 2006, AustraliaUniv Macquarie, Dept Environm Sci, Sydney, NSW, Australia",,,,2019-11-01,WOS:000485660800043,,,,,

Typically ice loads of interest are for 10(-2), 10(-3) or 10(-4) annual probability of exceedance (APE) levels, with appropriate factoring to the required safety level.The ISO 19906 standard recommends methods to determine global sea ice loads on vertical structures, where crushing is the predominant failure mode. Fitted coefficients are proposed for both Arctic and Sub-Arctic (e.g. Baltic) conditions. With the extreme ice thickness expected at the site of interest, an annual global sea ice load can be derived deterministically. Although the simplicity of the proposed relation provides quick design load estimates, it lacks accuracy because the only dependencies are structure width, ice thickness and provided coefficients; no consideration is given to site-specific sea ice conditions and the corresponding exposure. Additionally, no term is provided for including ice management in the design load basis.This paper presents a probabilistic methodology to modify the deterministic ISO 19906 relations for determining global and local first-year sea ice loads on vertical structures. The presented methodology is based on the same ice pressure data as presented in ISO 19906, but accounts better for the influence. of ice exposure, ice management and site-specific sea ice data. This is especially beneficial for ice load analyses of seasonal operations where exposure to sea ice is limited, and only thinner ice is encountered.

The concentration of chloride and sodium, used as tracers of saline deposition, was measured in thalli of Ramalina spp., and was shown to be dependent on the distance from the coast, the intensity of rain observed before the sampling date and the dry period before sampling. These three factors were used in the definition of a space-time multiplicative regression model that reproduces the space-time trend of the data, and was used as secondary variable in kriging with external drift.

For more scientific approaches, improvements have to be made in identifying the erosion processes that occur within the zone of soil adjacent to the pile. This paper addresses the problem of offshore pile installation in saturated clay by examining the mechanisms associated with water jet techniques. Parameters controlling installation geometry and pile embedment depth within the seabed are established based on tests carried out in laboratory physical scale using downward vertical water jets in highly compressible clay. Observations and measurements indicate that the geometry of the smeared and fluidized zone is constrained to two pile diameters, the eroded cavity under the pile tip is controlled by the nozzle jet Reynolds number, and the penetration embedment depth is a function of pile mass and applied water flowrate. It is demonstrated that penetration embedment depth is a function of pile mass and applied water flowrate. Based on the laws of similarity and statistical analysis, an equation is proposed for the maximum embedment depth of piles in clay, which is described as a function of pile geometry and mass, nozzle Reynolds number of water jet, along with the fluid and soil properties.",,,,,,,,,6,0,0,0,0,0,6,,,0892-7219,1528-896X,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Fed Rio Grande do Sul, Av Osvaldo Aranha 99,3 Andar, BR-90035190 Porto Alegre, RS, Brazil",,,,2020-08-19,WOS:000556594300021,,,,,

This review summarizes the current state of knowledge on interactions between wind farms and bats in Europe, and compares it with the situation in the countries of the European boreal biogeographic region. We analyzed data from papers published in international and national scientific journals, focusing on studies conducted in Europe. The issue of the impacts wind power has on bats is clearly overlooked in most of the countries of the European boreal region, with low volumes of research available on the topic. This is probably due to fewer wind farms in the area, making this recent issue a less-prioritized topic. However, the Baltic Sea, and the countries surrounding it, are of extreme importance with regards to bat migration, especially for the Pipistrellus nathusii.

Monitoring such an environment was not possible with single vertical echo sounders, due to the fact that the artificial structures and the natural targets were not distinguishable. Monitoring data were collected along the French Mediterranean coastline, during five short surveys of mussel culture longline areas. Both the Reson Seabat 6012 multibeam sonar (455 kHz) and the Simrad SR 240 omnidirectional sonar (23.75 kHz) were used for target detection. The former tools allow accurate allocation of the different types of echoes to artefacts, fish schools and scattered fish. The school characteristics collected included morphological, geographical (GPS, school location), and behavioural (connections with the longlines). An acoustic survey undertaken with the same hardware near the study area allowed the comparison of fish schools and the TS distribution of individual fish in the open sea and in the mussel area. These data permitted us to evaluate the ecological impact of a mussel culture on the ecosystem, in a context of predation behaviour of fish on these longlines. Finally, the acoustic data revealed the configuration of each concession and the level of charge of each line. We discuss the applicability of this technology for in situ real time monitoring for joint management of such ecosystems. The information can allow littoral cooperative management or incorporating it into an ecosystem approach. (C) 2003 Editions scientifiques et medicales Elsevier SAS and Ifremer/IRD/Inra/Cemagref.

Firstly, there is a need to redefine the nature of the interactions between coastal inhabitants and coastal ecosystems, so that environments are sustainably developed; and specifically that reefs are conserved and shoreline vegetarian (especially mangroves) is effectively replanted. Secondly, information about appropriate design and composition of artificial structures for shoreline protection needs to be made available to the local communities who construct most of them.

The installation and operation of these devices can result in conflicts with wildlife. In the marine environment, mammals may avoid wind farms that are under construction or operating. Such avoidance may lead to more time spent travelling or displacement from key habitats. A paucity of data on at-sea movements of marine mammals around wind farms limits our understanding of the nature of their potential impacts. Here, we present the results of a telemetry study on harbour seals Phoca vitulina in The Wash, south-east England, an area where wind farms are being constructed using impact pile driving. We investigated whether seals avoid wind farms during operation, construction in its entirety, or during piling activity. The study was carried out using historical telemetry data collected prior to any wind farm development and telemetry data collected in 2012 during the construction of one wind farm and the operation of another. Within an operational wind farm, there was a close-to-significant increase in seal usage compared to prior to wind farm development. However, the wind farm was at the edge of a large area of increased usage, so the presence of the wind farm was unlikely to be the cause. There was no significant displacement during construction as a whole. However, during piling, seal usage (abundance) was significantly reduced up to 25km from the piling activity; within 25km of the centre of the wind farm, there was a 19 to 83% (95% confidence intervals) decrease in usage compared to during breaks in piling, equating to a mean estimated displacement of 440 individuals. This amounts to significant displacement starting from predicted received levels of between 166 and 178dB re 1Pa((p-p)). Displacement was limited to piling activity; within 2h of cessation of pile driving, seals were distributed as per the non-piling scenario.Synthesis and applications. Our spatial and temporal quantification of avoidance of wind farms by harbour seals is critical to reduce uncertainty and increase robustness in environmental impact assessments of future developments. Specifically, the results will allow policymakers to produce industry guidance on the likelihood of displacement of seals in response to pile driving; the relationship between sound levels and avoidance rates; and the duration of any avoidance, thus allowing far more accurate environmental assessments to be carried out during the consenting process. Further, our results can be used to inform mitigation strategies in terms of both the sound levels likely to cause displacement and what temporal patterns of piling would minimize the magnitude of the energetic impacts of displacement.Our spatial and temporal quantification of avoidance of wind farms by harbour seals is critical to reduce uncertainty and increase robustness in environmental impact assessments of future developments.

Most of them distinguish resident from transient species according to their habitat association level. Despite its wide use, this distinction presents practical complications for two main reasons: first, the method used for assessing habitat association level may cause mistakes, and second, no objective method has been proposed thus far to determine the habitat association level that should be considered as a boundary between resident and transient species. This paper aims at overcoming these two problems. In order to improve and standardize assessment of habitat association level, we developed a habitat association index (HAI) whose calculation requires only presence-absence data. By taking into account both species occurrence rate and occurrence patterns, our index minimizes the risk of erroneously perceiving species as being equally associated to a habitat. In order to distinguish between resident and transient species objectively, we propose to plot HAI against occurrence rate and then seek the combination providing the most significantly different groups with reference to the relation between these two variables.

The first is to advance offshore wind siting methods by creating a new multi-criteria assessment framework that integrates life cycle assessment (LCA), geographic information systems (GIS), viewshed modeling, aquatic ecology, and economics to analyze the consequences of design, policy, and engineering decisions of offshore wind farm siting. By accomplishing this task, offshore wind siting assessment can integrate the many competing siting objectives within a cohesive evaluation environment, and a general methodology will be developed for site evaluation. The second task is to apply this multi-criteria methodology to the Great Lakes region to explore how offshore wind farm siting locations will impact the electric sector, environmental quality (through emissions reductions and aquatic life impacts), and local viewsheds. The completion of this task will inform the development of policy and technology with respect to offshore wind turbines, and will provide tools for conducting these analyses. The research effort will develop multi-criteria analyses that use GIS, LCA, and optimization methods to analyze and visualize the economic, environmental, and social impacts of siting offshore wind turbines. This model will incorporate data from numerous sources, much of which is geographically unique (topography, bathymetry, wind resource, population, demographics, food web), but the methods will be applicable to any location. The integration and optimization of the economic, environmental, and social impacts is a unique contribution to research in offshore wind. It allows the simultaneous evaluation of these potentially disparate objectives, and creates a means of identifying the tradeoffs that exist between them. One globally identified challenge facing humanity is the reduction of greenhouse gasses from the energy sector. Offshore wind represents a tremendous resource, but the planning and deployment of offshore wind turbines has been met with much social resistance. A more thorough and holistic approach to wind site analysis may reduce such resistance and thereby streamline offshore wind siting. This research will create a methodology for evaluating and supporting offshore wind farm siting and development that better accounts for economic, social, and environmental impacts. The multi-criteria assessment framework will be applied to a siting project in Michigan, but the methodology will be applicable to other offshore wind developments, and will enhance the understanding of tradeoffs associated with offshore wind farms to key stakeholders (e.g., local communities, developers, government agencies, investors). A teaching module on integrated assessment of offshore wind siting will be developed and tested in two Master's courses for the UM School of Natural Resources and Environment, and then refined for widespread dissemination through the UM Center for Sustainable Systems website. A professionally developed podcast or video short will be produced, posted to social media sites for broad educational impacts from K to grey, and provided to the Great Lakes Wind Collaborative for dissemination. The educational impact of this project includes both graduate and undergraduate students through independent research and course module integration. A PhD student will work on advanced GIS research for offshore wind siting which will include electricity grid and environmental modeling. This project will also leverage the UM Undergraduate Research Opportunity Program to engage undergraduates from numerous diverse backgrounds and cultures. The research team will use the research findings to update and create Wikipedia pages on topics such as ?offshore wind power?, ?electricity from wind?, and other relevant topics.

The effects on marine top predators from displacement from important habitat are key concerns during offshore wind farm construction and operation. In this respect, we present evidence for no significant displacement from a UK offshore wind farm for two broadly distributed species of conservation concern: common guillemot (Uria aalge) and harbor porpoise (Phocoena phocoena). Data were collected during boat-based line transect surveys across a 360 km(2) study area that included the Robin Rigg offshore wind farm. Surveys were conducted over 10 years across the preconstruction, construction, and operational phases of the development. Changes in guillemot and harbor porpoise abundance and distribution in response to offshore wind farm construction and operation were estimated using generalized mixed models to test for evidence of displacement. Both common guillemot and harbor porpoise were present across the Robin Rigg study area throughout all three development phases. There was a significant reduction in relative harbor porpoise abundance both within and surrounding the Robin Rigg offshore wind farm during construction, but no significant difference was detected between the preconstruction and operational phases. Relative common guillemot abundance remained similar within the Robin Rigg offshore wind farm across all development phases. Offshore wind farms have the potential to negatively affect wildlife, but further evidence regarding the magnitude of effect is needed. The empirical data presented here for two marine top predators provide a valuable addition to the evidence base, allowing future decision making to be improved by reducing the uncertainty of displacement effects and increasing the accuracy of impact assessments.",,,,,,,,,9,0,0,0,6,0,11,,,2045-7758,,,,,,,,,,,"Nat Power, Stirling, ScotlandQueens Crescent, Falkirk, Scotland",Nat PowerQueens Crescent,,,2017-11-23,WOS:000414873600003,29152170,,,,

Several possible predictor variables were explored to explain shrimp abundances across habitat types and tides, including wave action, vegetation cover, local taxonomic richness, temperature, and salinity. Shrimp abundances were mainly influenced by habitat type, temperature, taxonomic richness, and vegetation cover. Shrimp abundances were higher in artificial in contrast to natural habitats (particularly along bulkheading), higher in areas with intermediate levels of taxonomic richness, and higher in habitats with vegetation cover compared to areas without. Shrimp abundance also had a weak, but positive, correlation with temperature. Along bulkheads and in natural habitats, abundances were higher at low versus high tide; however, there was no tidal variation along floating docks.

In the Murray River, south-eastern Australia, we examined the relationship between attributes of watering and fish production (species-specific recruitment, total abundance), at two time intervals: short term (6-8weeks after watering) and at the end of the spawning season (April) for 26 discrete watering events. The study also recognised the importance of habitat in mediating fish responses to watering and examined whether fish abundance after environmental water delivery is better predicted by attributes of watering or wetland characteristics? We found that attributes of watering, including water source, its method of delivery and timing, best described fish recruitment (0+ abundance) and total fish abundance.

The development of chain climbing robots is still in its infancy due to the complicated climbing structure presented by mooring chains. The purpose of this paper is to establish an automated climbing technique for mooring chain inspection.Design/methodology/approach This paper presents a Cartesian legged tracked-wheel crawler robot developed for mooring chain inspection. The proposed robot addresses the misalignment condition of the mooring chains which is commonly evident in in situ conditions.Findings The mooring chain link misalignment is investigated mathematically and used as a design parameter for the proposed robot. The robot is validated with laboratory-based climbing experiments.Practical implications Chain breaking can lead to vessel drift and serious damage such as riser rupture, production shutdown and hydrocarbon release. Currently, structural health monitoring of chain links is conducted using either remotely operated vehicles which come at a high cost or by manual means which increase the danger to human operators. The robot can be used as a platform to convey equipment, i.e. tools for non-destructive testing/evaluation applications.Originality/value This study has upgraded a previously designed magnetic adhesion tracked-wheel mooring chain climbing robot to address the misalignment issues of operational mooring chains.

The proposed methodological approach has proved to be a very useful tool for policy makers, enabling the simultaneous consideration of a significant number of uncertainty drivers. Moreover, the obtained results demonstrate the difficulties to propose a common feed-in tariff level for all offshore wind farms even in a small country like Greece. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

The ensuing flood levels in the St Lucia system (which have been exceeded perhaps only one other time in recorded history) provided an opportunity to assess the effect of a major disturbance on a subtropical estuarine system.Major geomorphological changes occurred in the mouth area where all man-made structures were obliterated. The two river channels were scoured from 2-3 m to 10-14 m in depth and widened by up to 300 m, while the shoreline between the two channels retreated in places up to 100 m. An estimated 16*10(6) m3 of sediment were removed from the lower reaches of the system including areas of mangrove and Phragmites australis swamp. One-metre tall mangrove saplings died following inundation lasting days to weeks.

Responses of other species such as the penaeid prawns, the crab Scylla serrata and the sole Solea bleekeri suggested that physiological tolerance, extended larval or juvenile recruitment periods and prey switching minimized long-term flood effects.

However, the necessary requirements mostly reflect issues of nature conservation: It must be ensured that neither protected areas/habitats nor protected species suffer from significant adverse impacts; they have to remain in a favourable conservation status. In view of uncertainties concerning the effects caused by ocean energy systems, Environmental Impact Studies are of great relevance when examining whether the installation fulfils the requirements of permissibility. The German Federal Maritime and eHydrographic Agency (BSH) has developed a detailed Standard for the Environmental Impact Assessment on Offshore Wind Farms which might be useful for ocean energy systems as well. Within the coastal zone, the installations would be permissible if it is ensured that environmental goods are not significantly affected; this needs to be decided on a case by case basis. Within the EEZ, the installations are permissible if they do not endanger the maritime environment. This suggests that the precautionary principle is not applicable. However, it has to be taken into account as far as species or habitats protected under European Directives are concerned. As a rule, permissibility of maritime installations is achieved by a multitude of collateral clauses to the actual permission, by stipulating certain requirements that help sparing the maritime environment. If in spite of such collateral clauses there are still significant adverse effects, it is necessary to obtain an exemption. Still, the favourable conservation status of habitats and species may not be compromised, and an imperative reason of overriding public interest is needed. Only here, clime protection, as a justification for the exemption, can be relevant.

Currently, various strengthening techniques such as ring stiffeners, gusset plates are employed to strengthen new and existing tubular joints. Due to some limitations with the present practices, some new techniques need to be addressed. Many researchers used Fibre Reinforced Polymer (FRP) to strengthen tubular joints. Some of the studies were focused on axial compression of Glass Fibre Reinforced Polymer (GFRP) strengthened tubular joints and found that it was an efficient technique. Earlier, the authors had performed studies on Carbon Fibre Reinforced Polymer (CFRP) strengthened tubular joint subjected to axial compression. The study steered to the conclusion that FRP composites is an alternative strengthening technique for tubular joints. In this work, the study was focused on axial compression of Y-joint and in plane and out of plane bending of T-joints.

Here, we describe the pilot project started in 1990 with the deployment of two artificial reefs, which was the baseline for the deployment of large artificial reef complexes in the coastal waters. By 2011, the Algarve artificial reef complexes will contain more than 21,500 modules, occupying a total area of 45 km(2), with an estimated area of influence of 70 km(2). The main results and achievements of a number of multidisciplinary studies are briefly presented, highlighting the usefulness of the artificial reefs on small-scale fisheries management. These summaries include different aspects of reef research that have been carried out during the last 20 years, namely: (1) artificial reef colonization and fish assemblages, (2) juvenile protection, (3) essential fish habitats, (4) predation and stocking, (5) catch and value per unit of effort and reef use, and (6) rebuilding fisheries. The importance of artificial reef management is raised, with particular emphasis on the issues related to open-access areas/fisheries. The need of long-term monitoring and applied research is also discussed, as the role of artificial reefs will be reinforced in the near future, taking into account the growing need to integrate fisheries and environmental policies into fisheries management.",,,,,9th International Conference on Artificial Reefs and Related Aquatic Habitats (CARAH)9th International Conference on Artificial Reefs and Related Aquatic Habitats (CARAH),"NOV 08-13, 2009NOV 08-13, 2009",,"Curitiba, BRAZILCuritiba, BRAZIL",11,0,0,0,7,1,14,,,2154-7769,,978-1-4398-2008-7; 978-1-4398-2007-0,,,,,,,,,"Natl Fisheries & Marine Sci Inst, Olhao, PortugalNatl Fisheries & Marine Sci Inst INRB, I P L IPIMAR, Olhao, Portugal",Natl Fisheries & Marine Sci InstNatl Fisheries & Marine Sci Inst INRB,,,2011-01-01,WOS:000356919700014,,,,,

Mutlu Sumer, on the emerging topic of foundation scour protection for offshore wind farms. Prof. Liu, accompanied by one U.S. graduate student, will bring modeling and computational expertise to the envisioned joint research while the DTU research team headed by Prof. Sumer will contribute significant expertise in the area of erosion and scour effects on wind turbine foundations. Through a series of technical presentations, group discussions, and site visits to wind energy companies based in Denmark, the researchers intend to focus their plans for a more extensive examination of fluid dynamic mechanisms that are involved in the scouring of offshore foundations. Preliminary results should provide new insight into the turbulent flow structures around piles protected by porous stone layers, with the goal of defining new engineering solutions that address issues related to the stability and construction of off-shore wind farms. If successful, this award will catalyze a new US-Danish research collaboration. Broader impacts may include new knowledge applicable to future efforts to prevent damages to offshore installations on seabed. Furthermore, the U.S. student's early career involvement will provide a valuable professional introduction to individuals and Danish institutions with expertise in a wide range of topics associated with the generation of carbon-free wind energy.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,1157478,,,,,,,,University of Texas at San Antonio,,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:13590334,,,,,

This challenge steepens as the percentage of renewably-generated electricity on the grid grows, but variability can be reduced by exploiting geographic diversity: correlations between wind farms decrease as the separation between wind farms increases. But how far is far enough to reduce variability? Grid management requires balancing production on various timescales, and so consideration of correlations reflective of those timescales can guide the appropriate spatial scales of geographic diversity grid integration. To answer 'how far is far enough,' we investigate the universal behavior of geographic diversity by exploring wind-speed correlations using three extensive datasets spanning continents, durations and time resolution. First, one year of five-minute wind power generation data from 29 wind farms span 1270 kmacross Southeastern Australia (Australian Energy Market Operator). Second, 45 years of hourly 10 m wind-speeds from 117 stations span 5000 km across Canada (National Climate Data Archive of Environment Canada). Finally, four years of five-minute wind-speeds from 14 meteorological towers span 350 km of the Northwestern US (Bonneville Power Administration). After removing diurnal cycles and seasonal trends from all datasets, we investigate dependence of correlation length on time scale by digitally high-pass filtering the data on 0.25-2000 h timescales and calculating correlations between sites for each high-pass filter cut-off. Correlations fall to zero with increasing station separation distance, but the characteristic correlation length varies with the high-pass filter applied: the higher the cut-off frequency, the smaller the station separation required to achieve de-correlation. Remarkable similarities between these three datasets reveal behavior that, if universal, could be particularly useful for grid management. For high-pass filter time constants shorter than about tau = 38 h, all datasets exhibit a correlation length xi that falls at least as fast as tau(-1). Since the inter-site separation needed for statistical independence falls for shorter time scales, higher-rate fluctuations can be effectively smoothed by aggregating wind plants over areas smaller than otherwise estimated.",,,,,,,,,45,1,0,0,0,0,49,,,1748-9326,,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Colorado, Dept Atmospher & Ocean Sci, Boulder, CO 80309 USANatl Renewable Energy Lab, Golden, CO USAEnduring Energy LLC, Boulder, CO USA",Enduring Energy LLC,,,2015-05-20,WOS:000353641400005,,,,,

There are many risks associated with the process of constructing a subsea well, pumping oil to the platform, and transporting it to refineries via underwater pipes or oil tankers. All actions performed by workers in those operations are influenced by specific working conditions, involving the use of complex systems. Contextual factors such as high noise, low and high temperatures and hazardous chemicals are considered to be contributors to unsafe human actions in accident analysis and also give a basis for assessing human factors in safety analysis. Some failure modes are particularly dangerous and can result in severe accidents and damage to humans, the environment and material assets. Fires and explosions on oil rigs are some of the most devastating types of offshore accidents and can result in long-term consequences. The most typical root causes related to accidents include equipment failure, human error, environmental factors, work organization, training and, communication, among others. The principal objective of this study is to propose a methodological framework to identify the factors that affect the performance of operators of an offshore unit for oil processing and treatment. In this phase, an ergonomics approach based on operators' work analysis is used as a supporting tool. After identification of factors that affect the performance of operators, a decision-making model based on AHP (analytic hierarchy process) is applied to rank and weight the principal performance shaping factors (PSFs) that influence safe operations. The next step involves the use of the SHELLO model to group the main PSFs in elements named software, hardware, environment, liveware and organization. In the last phase, a relevant accident that occurred aboard a floating production storage and offloading (FPSO) vessel is analyzed. The allocation process of the factors that affect the operator's performance in risk assessment was developed through fuzzy logic and the ISO 17776 standard.",,,,,,,,,16,0,0,0,1,0,16,,,0950-4230,1873-3352,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Fed Rio de Janeiro, Inst Engn Nucl, PEA, CNEN, BR-21941906 Rio de Janeiro, RJ, BrazilUniv Fed Fluminense, Programa Posgrad Engn Civil, Rua Passos Patria 156,Bloco D, BR-24210020 Niteroi, RJ, BrazilUniv Fed Rio de Janeiro, Ctr Tecnol, Escola Politecn, Programa Engn Ambiental, Bloco D, BR-21941909 Rio De Janeiro, RJ, BrazilUniv Fed Rio de Janeiro, Escola Politecn, Programa Engn Ambiental, Bloco D, BR-21941909 Rio De Janeiro, RJ, Brazil",,,,2020-05-11,WOS:000528588300025,,,,,

In one program, we tagged 5,614 red snapper at over 200 fishing sites between July 2002 and August 2005 using hook-and-line gear; fishermen and others reported 130 recaptured fish (a 2.3% return rate), 82 of which included location data. About 54% of the recaptured fish had moved, with an average movement of 20.4 km. In the other program, over 9,000 fish were tagged between 1983 and 2006, but only 68 records of fish tagged between 1986 and 2000 could be analyzed due to computer problems. Of the recaptured fish, 60 could be analyzed for movement, and 17 fish (28%) had moved an average of 19.1 km. Important predictors of movement in at least one program or analysis were depth, habitat type, isolation of the initial capture location, time at liberty, and fish size. Red snapper showed a higher probability of movement from capture sites that were in deep water (>40 m), natural rather than artificial structures, and isolated from other sites rather than clustered. Differences in movement from natural versus artificial sites may have been related to red snapper 'sub-cohort' behavior, (the tendency of small groups of red snapper to associate together), as the majority of fish that moved were members of sub-cohorts. Larger fish had a higher probability of movement than smaller fish. In one program, fish movements increased with increasing time at liberty, which is similar to past studies on red snapper site fidelity. In the other program, movements decreased with increasing time at liberty, but this was probably a bias caused by the spatial and temporal scale of the recapture effort. Red snapper that moved showed a higher average daily growth rate between capture and recapture than fish that were stationary, suggesting that movements may be beneficial for red snapper. The spatial scale of fish movements in this study, although larger than in other studies without hurricanes or translocation of fish, was still small enough to support the idea that red snapper populations in the northern Gulf of Mexico are relatively isolated, and that there may be a separate demographic stock off Texas.",,,,,Symposium on Fisheries Ecology of Gulf of Mexico Red SnapperSymposium on Fisheries Ecology of Gulf of Mexico Red Snapper,"FEB 10-12, 2006FEB 10-12, 2006","Sea Grant Louisiana; NOAA; Univ West Florida; Univ S Alabama; Louisiana State Univ, Coastal Fisheries InstSea Grant Louisiana; NOAA; Univ West Florida; Univ S Alabama; Louisiana State Univ, Coastal Fisheries Inst","San Antonio, TXSan Antonio, TX",19,0,0,0,18,0,28,,,0892-2284,,978-1-888569-97-1,,,,,,,,,"Univ Western Sydney, Locked Bag 1797, Penrith, NSW 1797, AustraliaTexas Tech Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Lubbock, TX 79409 USATexas Parks & Wildlife, Brownsville, TX 78412 USAFish Trackers Inc, Corpus Christi, TX 78412 USA",Texas Parks & WildlifeFish Trackers Inc,,,2007-01-01,WOS:000253386500011,,,,,

Two feeding experiments with turbot were conducted in an initial experiment to test the applicability of mussel meal as a fishmeal replacement and/or supplement in turbot feed. In experiment A, the welfare, acceptance, and digestibility of feedstuff with 100%, 50% and 0% of mussel meal replacement for the fishmeal were tested for 8weeks. In experiment B that followed, the convenience ratio of mussel meal protein in turbot feed for optimum growth was examined. Feedstuff with 25%, 10% and 0% of mussel meal were also fed for 8 (+6) weeks. Growth rates of fish were measured every 2weeks and their health condition (liver somatic index) determined at the beginning and end of the experiments. Experiment A revealed that a replacement of fishmeal with either 100% or 50% mussel meal resulted in depressed growth (SGR: 1.31 +/- 0.04 with 100% mussel meal; 1.54 +/- 0.04 with 50% mussel meal; 1.71 +/- 0.07 with 0% mussel meal). Experiment B revealed that a fishmeal replacement with 10% or 25% of mussel meal did not reduce growth nor did it have a negative effect on the health of the tested turbot. The study revealed that mussel meal has a high potential to serve as a supplement or as a fishmeal replacement in feed for turbot raised in aquaculture systems.

However, globally only a few offshore wind farms are operating. As more wind farms start operating and more people become experienced with especially the visual impacts from offshore wind farms, the public positive attitude could change if the experienced impacts are different from the initially perceived visual interference. Using a binary logit model, the present paper investigates the relation between different levels of prior experience with visual disamenities from offshore wind farms and perception of visual impacts from offshore wind farms. The differences in prior experience are systematically controlled for sampling respondents living in the areas close to the large scale offshore wind farms Nysted and Horns Rev and by sampling the a group of respondents representing the Danish population, which has little experience with offshore wind farms. Compared to previous results in the literature, the present paper finds that perception of wind power generation is influenced by prior experience. More specifically, the results show that people with experience from offshore wind farms located far from the coast have a significant more positive perception of the visual impacts from offshore wind farms than people with experience from wind farms located closer to the coast. These results are noteworthy on two levels. First of all, the results show that perceptions of offshore wind generation are systematically significantly influenced by prior experience with offshore wind farms. Secondly, and in a policy context, the results indicate that the future acceptance of future offshore wind farms is not independent of the location of existing and new offshore wind farms. This poses for caution in relation to locating offshore wind farms too close to the coast. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

However, the proliferation of artificial infrastructures (i.e. marinas and breakwaters) may contribute to destroy and fragment marine natural habitats, to alter the connectivity among populations and, as a consequence, the natural seascape. In particular, the upper sub tidal rocky fringe, where the coastal transformations are more conspicuous, represents the natural habitat of dominant engineering algae, such as Cystoseira and Sargassum; some of them, because of their sensitivity to environmental variability, are considered biological elements of water quality.The recent attempt to measure historical changes in macro algal diversity in the Gulf of Naples has highlighted a dramatic decrease of Cystoseira species in the upper sub littoral zones and at the same time the lack of information on their up to date extension. To verify the influence of coastal development on the decline of Cystoseira species in the Gulf, the percentage of natural/artificial coastal length has been estimated with Google Earth orto-photos. The results testified a correspondence: the higher was the Cystoseira spp. loss, the greater was the development of artificial urban infrastructures.To follow the temporal dynamics of these shallow systems, a complete remonitoring of the fucoid distribution along the Neapolitan coast has been planned. Up to now, the occurrence of these species has been mapped and digitalized in a qGIS database (scale 1:2,500) for the shallowest fringe of the island of Ischia. An ongoing homogenization of diversity at a medium scale has been recorded: Cystoseira compressa (the less sensitive species) is the widespread species; fragmented stands of Cystoseira amentacea (the most sensitive) still exist. Their distribution is limited to natural habitats slope more gently while the highest diversity has been reached in rocky pools. Occasional settlements were recorded on artificial structures when natural marine habitat was preserved in the surrounding area and the distance among the algal patches could not be a limiting factor in the spreading of the species. These preliminary data seem to suggest that a stronger collaboration between engineers and ecologists could favour a better coastal management in order to mitigate the impacts of artificial infrastructures on natural marine ecosystems and avoid the loss of biodiversity.",,,,,12th International Conference on the Mediterranean Coastal Environment (MEDCOAST)12th International Conference on the Mediterranean Coastal Environment (MEDCOAST),"OCT 06-10, 2015OCT 06-10, 2015","Mediterranean Coastal Fdn; Inst Oceanol; Inst Fish Resources; Republ Turkey, Promot FundMediterranean Coastal Fdn; Inst Oceanol; Inst Fish Resources; Republ Turkey, Promot Fund","Varna, BULGARIAVarna, BULGARIA",4,0,0,0,3,0,4,,,,,978-605-85652-3-4,,,,,,,,,"Ctr Villa Dohrn Ischia Benth Ecol, Stn Zool Anton Dohrn Napoli, I-80077 Ischia, NA, Italy",,,,2016-07-06,WOS:000377577200027,,,,,

It was found that the distribution of various grain size fractions and settling velocities revealed a well-defined cross-shore energy gradient. Adjacent to the mainland dike the sediment is dominated by the 3.0-3.5 phi sand fraction ( gt 70% by weight). In comparison to the sedimentary sequences normally observed in unobstructed backbarrier depositional environments, the sediments along the land-ward margin are in this case conspicuously depleted in grain sizes lt 3.5 phi, the corresponding size fractions contributing lt 20% by weight. This suggests that the dike interrupts the normal energy gradient, thereby inhibiting the deposition of sediments with settling velocities lt 0.5 cm s-1. This interpretation is confirmed when comparing individual cross-shore transects. The shorter the transect between the barrier island shore and the dike, the greater the fine sediment depletion. Since many faunal assemblages are grain-size specific, it is further suggested that the backbarrier ecosystem must have undergone significant modifications as a result of the substantial reduction in mud flats since the onset of dike construction some 1000 years BP. It is predicted that in the wake of the persisting and possibly accelerating sea level rise this process of fine sediment depletion will continue and also affect progressively coarser sediments.",,,,,,,,,66,1,0,0,15,0,66,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Forschungsinst.

In the summer, removal of specific combinations of macroalgae from the pinnacle tops resulted in an increase in urchin density. Artificial structures that imitated certain common seaweeds were placed on pinnacle tops and inhibited urchin movement. Clod cards that were used to measure relative abrasion rates on vegetated and cleared pinnacles demonstrated that algae cause a significant amount of abrasion.

In this study, a seven-year experiment examined how the addition of small pits to otherwise featureless seawalls may enhance the stocks of a highly-exploited limpet. Modified areas of the seawall supported enhanced stocks of limpets seven years after the addition of pits. Modified areas of the seawall also supported a community that differed in the abundance of littorinids, barnacles and macroalgae compared to the controls. Responses to different treatments (numbers and size of pits) were species-specific and, while some species responded directly to differences among treatments, others might have responded indirectly via changes in the distribution of competing species.

To establish desirable directions for future cooperation in this field, we analyzed three recent artificial reef projects in the Philippines and Senegal. Past experience has begun to teach us that artificial reef deployment alone does not produce clear, positive effects in enhancing fisheries resources, but rather leads to the opposite effect of attracting fishing activities in protected areas. As poverty among fishermen lies behind this problem, it is imperative to include economic activities, such as commercialization of highly valued fish in artificial reef projects. Income from such activities can be used to compensate for the decline of income due to reduction of catch and to raise funds for sustainable surveillance of undesirable fishing practices on the artificial reefs. Furthermore, artificial reef projects must be integrated in a broader fisheries management plan in order to be effective. Unless the positive impacts of artificial reefs are clearly established, they should not be overestimated.

J,,,,,,,,,,,Dynamics of Mooring System for Floating Offshore Wind Turbine (FOWT),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Awarded Grant,Jan 01 2018,2018,"In deep water offshore, mooring systems can contribute significantly to the total cost of the system. Whilst this may not be such a compelling issue with the offshore oil and gas industry where profit is very large, it is vital factor for FOWTs where accomplishing a cost effective and profitable system is the one of the main challenges facing developers. As installed capacity increases and shallow water near shore sites are exhausted, projects will need to be developed further from shore and in deeper water, which will pose greater technical challenges and constrain efforts to reduce costs. There are a number of floating wind concepts currently under development, but there is no clear favourite at this stage with regard to which concept is most likely to be deployed at industrial scale in the future as other ideas are being proposed and investigated.In terms of technology development of floating offshore wind turbine, it is essential to have a clear understanding about the structure behaviour in harsh environment as well as to consider a sustainable, reliable, and cost effective mooring and anchor system. This means, it is important to demonstrate how the mooring, anchoring and cabling elements of the system can be utilized aim for improving levelized cost of energy (LCOE) and the lifecycle of the wind farm. Therefore, there is a need for improved understanding of those factors to drive towards large scale development.This project concentrates on developing reliable methods to solve the static and dynamic response of mooring lines to examine how this knowledge transfers into the design of mooring system in terms of technical requirements and guidelines on design and construction of positioning mooring system.This study will use realistic met-ocean data (wave, wind, current and geotechnical) which represents shallow and deep water sites suitable for wind farms of more than 100 floating wind turbines. In order to develop the innovative technologies required to reduce the cost, experiences from industries leading this concept can be adapted for establishing a base case design of a FOWT. The key elements of the mooring system include catenary and semi taut mooring lines with disconnecting ability, top loaded suction piles and tensioning mooring line at anchor to investigate the coupled dynamics of the mooring and platform dynamics. Better estimation of extreme forces and the distribution of fatigue loads will enable to find more realistic, and thereby more economic safety factors that meet an acceptable probability of failure.The following presents a short summary of the new and innovative aspects addressed in the course of this project.- Numerical investigation of different types of 10MW FOWT system dynamic behaviour in irregular wave conditions, facing unsteady wind by applying combined aerodynamics, hydrodynamic, current forces on the system. Coupled analysis will be conducted for a range of operating conditions and to evaluate system safety in survival conditions. - Identify optimised mooring configurations for FOWT through a thorough investigation of various key aspects such as material properties, mooring layout and anchor properties and their influence on the fatigue life of key components.- Investigate symmetric and asymmetric mooring systems to evaluate critical safety aspects in case of failure, especially for closely spaced arrays and in case of anchor sharing.- Apply analytical methods of FOWT design optimization with the aim to study the detailed influence of various design constraints (eigenfrequency, extreme load and fatigue load constraints) on the structural design and the performance optimization procedure.- Conduct an experimental model test of a 10MW FOWT complete system including unsteady wind, irregular wave and current forces.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,2029586,,,,,,,,University of Strathclyde,,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:15311400,,,,,

The related debris-avalanche (DA) deposits extend north 70 km from the island shore and have a total volume of about 800 km(3). Two contrasted facies of the debris are recognized: (1) relatively small-sized material, including a few blocks with well-developed flow structures (elongate downslope-directed ridges and transversal pressure ridges), and (2) a scattering of large kilometer-sized individual blocks that form, in part, a prominent bathymetric hummock in the proximal central part of the landslide deposits. Bathymetric analyses suggest that the Tahitian failure evolved through two main successive shots. The DA debris were rapidly overlain by subsequent volcanic material, producing a smooth surface down to 1500 m below sea level. The on-land and offshore structures indicate a listric fault geometry for the landslide scar. The volume removed by the landslide is thus estimated between 400 km(3) and 450 km(3). Discrepancy in the volume of the scar, and the debris derived from it, is due in part to expansion of the debris, to fragmentation of the avalanche, and to incorporation of sediments. Comparison with a recently recognized southern Tahitian landslide (Clouard et al., 2001) and with landslides recognized around the Hawaiian Islands and the Canary Islands shows that the huge northern Tahitian landslide described here has a reduced mobility in its central part. Perhaps the older Tetiaroa eruptive complex to the north acted as a buttress to inhibit movement of the DA products. The northern and southern Tahiti-Nui landslides moved in opposite directions away from the main central E-W directed rift zone that served as the main magma feeding structure. Then, the huge northern landslide strongly controlled the later volcano-structural evolution by capturing subsequent volcanic activity to the north, despite the northwestward displacement of the Pacific plate over the Society hot spot.",,,,,,,,,37,0,0,0,5,0,37,,,,1525-2027,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Paris Sud, Equipe Geochronol, F-91405 Orsay, FranceCNRS, IPG Paris, Lab Geosci Marines, F-75252 Paris 05, France",,,,2006-03-16,WOS:000236330200002,,,,,

The resulting integrated model of the jacket/caissons/soil body has been examined under push-over environmental loads. The results have then been assessed against those obtained from the corresponding jackets with driven pile foundations. From the current study, the suction caisson foundations have been found to be able to contest the deep pile foundation solution due to savings in the material utilization costs and their load carrying capacity.",,,,,27th International Conference on Offshore Mechanics and Arctic Engineering27th International Conference on Offshore Mechanics and Arctic Engineering,"JUN 15-20, 2008JUN 15-20, 2008","ASME, Ocean, Offshore, & Arct Engn DivASME, Ocean, Offshore, & Arct Engn Div","Estoril, PORTUGALEstoril, PORTUGAL",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,978-0-7918-4819-7,,,,,,,,,"KNToosi Univ Technol, Fac Civil Engn, Tehran, Iran",KNToosi Univ Technol,,,2008-01-01,WOS:000263876000056,,,,,

Proper management of generated garnet waste is necessary to protect the environment, reduce cost, and save recourses. An approach based on the well-known hierarchy of waste management, with emphasis on waste recovery as the commonsense solution, was followed in this study. Two waste samples (one resulting from blasting onshore structures and the other from blasting offshore structures) were utilized. A thorough investigation to characterize the waste samples was conducted. Results revealed that garnet waste generated onshore does not pose any environmental concern but waste generated offshore is contaminated with oil and grease and has high zinc content. Results also showed that about 85% of the waste garnet falls in the range of the grain-size of new garnet. Physical and chemical characteristics of this fraction for the onshore garnet waste were similar to those of new garnet. The suitability of this fraction to be reused in garnet blasting was confirmed by a performance test. It was also demonstrated that the nonrecoverable waste fraction can be recycled in concrete construction without any impact on the strength of the concrete mix. Removal of oil and grease from the offshore garnet waste by combustion was explored. A minimum temperature of 500degreesC is needed to substantially decrease the level of oil and grease associated with the offshore garnet waste.

In this review, potential consequences for fish stocks and fisheries are evaluated based on available information, and the most critical gaps of knowledge in assessing environmental impacts are identified. A lack of empirical data and scientifically evaluated case studies is recognized. Together with the fact that many commercial species are close to or below biologically secure limits, this makes a strong case for emphasizing efforts to minimize potential negative effects on fish in the establishment of offshore wind farms. 1. Large part of the evaluations presented in this review is based on general ecological knowledge and experiences from other marine activities, rather than from actual wind farms. A critical concern is that only few of the results referred to have been scientifically evaluated.2. The risk for negative effects may in many cases be reduced by technical solutions, and by considering local ecological processes during planning.Monitoring of established wind farms is essential both for increasing knowledge on the effects on fish, and for identifying correct mitigation actions where needed. 3. During the construction stage, a general risk to particularly young life stages of fish is identified. The expected types of impact are similar to those in other marine activities, such as piling and dredging, but the geographical and temporal extent is expected to be higher. I order to minimize negative effects, establishment should be avoided in significant recruitment areas, and construction activities should be avoided during critical reproductive seasons. Research should focus on identifying essential fish habitats for purposes of marine planning, and on the development of construction methods that minimize negative effects. 4. During the operational stage, a low level of impact on fish is generally assumed, however the current state of knowledge in this field is poor. The two most critical issues identified are how the introduction of new physical structures affects local ecological community structures, and how the quality of fish recruitment areas is affected by increased noise. In order to minimize negative effects, establishment should be avoided in areas that are currently undisturbed by human activities, and in significant recruitment areas. The development of methods that minimize the effects of noise and electromagnetism should be favoured. 5. Off-shore wind farms are associated with restrictions to fishing by reduced access or gear restrictions. This has direct economical consequences for the fishermen affected. In large wind farms, reduced fishing efforts may have a positive effect on the growth of local commercial stocks, provided however that the stocks are not negatively affected by other types of impact from the wind farm. 6. Some fish species may be attracted to the wind farm area and others may avoid it. The catchability of fish is likely to increase in areas where fish is aggregated, which may have to be considered specifically in estimations of local stock sizes and management. 7. Changes in other parts of the ecosystem may have indirect on fish, for example changes in food supply. Ecologically integrated monitoring programs may reveal potential mechanisms behind any observed changes, and support the identification of areas most appropriate for large scale exploitation. 8. The expected level of impact is strongly dependent on local ecological conditions. However, current knowledge on the distribution and function of essential fish habitats in Swedish waters is too low to directly identify geographic areas most appropriate for exploitation. 9. In general, shallow areas have a higher potential value in terms of productivity, and establishment here is associated with a higher level of ecological risk. The current state of knowledge suggests that the risk for negative effects is lowest in areas below 15-20 meters depth, and in areas where the level ofhuman impact is currently high. In such areas, potential positive artificial reef effects are also expected to be highest. The highest level of risk is associated with relatively undisturbed off-shore shallows.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,1404-8590,,,,,,,,,,,"Fiskeriverkets Kustlaboratorium, Box 109, 742 22 Oregrund, Sweden",,,,2007-01-01,ZOOREC:ZOOR14407039215,,,,,

Many birds from both colonies made a clockwise loop migration around Britain and Ireland. Only a minority of birds from the Bass Rock returned northwards to the colony through the southern North Sea.

We use GPS telemetry to investigate movements of lesser black-backed gulls Larus fuscus in relation to OWFs from a protected site with an active breeding colony. Individual birds varied considerably in their use of OWFs; 15 out of 24 birds visited them, and time spent in these areas was 1.3% of time budgets across all birds. Two birds, for which the most data was collected, frequently entered OWFs and flew at turbine blade height; however, their overlap with the spherical 3-dimensional rotor swept volume was significantly lower than a random distribution. Although preliminary, these tracking data suggest a lack of a macro-scale (wind farm-scale) avoidance for L. fuscus but a potential meso-scale (within wind farm-scale) avoidance of turbines.

Our goal was to assess harbor conditions including dissolved copper pollution, position in relation to open coast, temperature, and artificial structure density (substrate for fouling) as determinants of macroinvertebrate recruitment. Settlement panels were deployed over a gradient of human coastal modification (28 sites in California and 2 in southern Australia). Non-indigenous macroinvertebrates dominated panel cover (overall by six-fold compared to indigenous taxa). Marinas and sites of heavy shipping showed high macroinvertebrate diversity, contrasting with open-coast sites of lower human impact [Santa Catalina Island (SCI) and one mainland coastal site] where there was low macroinvertebrate fouling. At two SCI sites with low vessel traffic, invertebrates that were rare on exposed panels were more common in a protected space between plastic strips indicating larvae amount does not completely explain low invertebrate diversity, suggesting a contributing role of predators or larval recruitment pattern. While dissolved copper levels correlated strongly with artificial structure measured at the water surface, the pollution gradient was not supported as a driver of macroinvertebrate diversity in semi-partial analysis. Density of artificial structure was supported as a better predictor of macroinvertebrate diversity, including separately analyzed non-indigenous and indigenous groups, than dissolved copper, distance from open coast or temperature variation in semi-partial correlation analysis. An artificial structure density measure may therefore increase power in predicting abundance of fouling organisms and could be useful in moderating the influence of non-indigenous species.",,,,,,,,,11,0,0,0,11,0,11,,,1387-3547,1573-1464,,,,,,,,,,"San Jose State Univ, San Jose, CA 95192 USACalif State Lands Commiss, Marine Invas Species Program, Long Beach, CA 90802 USAGilmac Pty Ltd, Perth, WA 6005, Australia",Calif State Lands CommissGilmac Pty Ltd,,,2019-11-03,WOS:000493672000001,,,,,

Their popularity lies in their potential for rehabilitating and enhancing coastal resources, particularly after the establishment of legal protection for coastal resources via regulations regarding fishing zonation in 1985. These human-made substrates were created from various materials, from tires to concrete structures. These structures were meant to create permanent sites conceptually similar to traditional artificial reefs deployed by local fishers that were more temporary in nature. Studies conducted up to the 1990s indicated that artificial reefs had the potential to bring resource users and managers together to establish a community-based management of small-scale coastal fisheries. However, the degree of progress made toward using artificial reefs to bring together users and managers remained obscure. Subsequently, a case study conducted between 2008 and 2010 used the sustainable livelihood approach to gain the perspectives of small-scale fishers on artificial reefs in Terengganu. This paper revisits the potential and challenges of using artificial reefs to implement a community-based fishery management approach. Focus is given to the institutional arrangements, both indigenous and official, that mediate the use of artificial reefs by small-scale fishers in Setiu. While many enabling factors exist, institutional weaknesses that impede a more inclusive management structure also persist. The importance of leveraging traditional fishing codes of conduct to manage access to artificial reefs is highlighted as the key to realizing the potential of deploying artificial reefs to enhance livelihoods based on sustainable fisheries resources.",,,,,Symposium on Marine Artificial Reef Research and Development: Integrating Fisheries Management ObjectivesSymposium on Marine Artificial Reef Research and Development: Integrating Fisheries Management Objectives,"AUG 22-23, 2017AUG 22-23, 2017",,"Tampa, FLTampa, FL",2,0,0,0,0,0,2,,,0892-2284,,978-1-934874-51-6,,,,,,,,,"Univ Malaysia Terengganu, Inst Trop Biodivers & Sustainable Dev, Kuala Nerus 21030, Terengganu, MalaysiaUniv N Carolina, Dept Geog, Carolina Hall,Campus Box 3220, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USAUniv Edinburgh, Sch Geosci, Drummond St, Edinburgh EH8 9XP, Midlothian, Scotland",,,,2019-02-13,WOS:000456750700014,,,,,

Remarkable casualties on related aspects are rising demand to ensure ship safety which in this subject is observed on marine structure. Ship is an example of marine structure that may be subjected to accidental loads during its operation. The aim of this paper is to investigate damage extent of the target ship under different accidental loads, namely collision and grounding with considerations to failure process and deformation contours. This work is divided into two parts which in the Part I, ship collision is discussed, and the Part II deals with interaction of ship structure with sea bottom in grounding. In Part II - Grounding impact, evaluating tearing damage on the bottom structure is essential in estimating environmental casualties caused by oil leakage. A chemical tanker is modelled to be the target ship in a series of grounding scenarios. Condition of the structural damage and tendency of the internal energy, crushing force and structural acceleration are observed. Prediction of the tearing opening and location of the initial failure in further grounding process are also presented in this paper. Virtual experiment is conducted by nonlinear finite element method in order to calculate the defined grounding scenarios which are built based on the target location on the bottom structure. Based on calculation results, condition of the double-hull structure after grounding is found to be highly influenced by arrangement of the longitudinal members which is evidenced by the fact that these members provide higher resistance than the transverse part. Finally, influence of the indenter's position on structural responses in grounding is summarized. (C) 2017 The Authors.

The optimum corrosion protection range without stress corrosion cracking and hydrogen embrittlement was concluded with the potential range of -0.5 similar to -0.2 V (vs. Ag/AgCl).",,,,,,,,,4,1,0,0,0,0,6,,,1001-0521,1867-7185,,,,,,,,,,"Mokpo Maritime Univ, Div Marine Syst Engn, Mokpo 530729, Jeonnam, South Korea",Mokpo Maritime Univ,,,2011-03-01,WOS:000303126300134,,,,,

Although numerous studies have examined their effects on fish communities, few have examined interactions between artificial reefs and primary producers or their effects on biogeochemistry of the surrounding water column. Understanding how reefs may alter biogeochemistry and primary producers is key to understanding overall reef productivity. In this study, we examined the relationships among epifauna, algae, and biogeochemical processes on artificial reefs located on the shallow Florida shelf in the Northeast Gulf of Mexico over a year following their deployment. We measured oxygen and nutrient fluxes, attached chlorophyll a, and invertebrate macrofauna. Temporal differences in biomass and chlorophyll a production occurred due to changes in in situ conditions including fluctuations in bottom-water temperature over the year as well as decreasing bottom-water oxygen and increasing chlorophyll a fluorescence during the summer. Invertebrate biomass was greater than micro- or macroalgal biomass. Biomass of the invertebrate epifaunal community increased exponentially during the first 5 months of this study. The reef was net heterotrophic with few differences between oxygen or nutrient fluxes in the light and dark. Positive nitrate and nitrite fluxes and abundances of amoA genes in the microbiomes of benthic invertebrates indicate significant nitrification associated with the epifaunal community.

Many countries are now conducting considerable research and development efforts to produce better materials, innovative forms of construction, improved inspection and monitoring techniques, and better evaluation procedures and criteria. Now is the time to examine the uncertainties found in bridge management. To address these deficiencies, it is necessary to determine the focus of future research. Clearly, the level of resources that is used in different areas of research should reflect the accuracy that is warranted by the end use. On the basis of experiences gained from bridge management as well as from similar activities in the field of offshore structures, the areas of uncertainty, such as method sophistication, operator expertise, and human and sampling errors, are identified.

Individual-based models (IBMs) are a powerful tool in predicting the consequences of environmental change on animal populations and supporting evidence-based decision making for conservation planning.2. There are increasing proposals for wind farms in UK waters and seabirds are a vulnerable group, which may be at risk from these developments.3. We developed a spatially explicit IBM to investigate the potential impacts of the installation of wind farms in the English Channel and North Sea on body mass, productivity and mortality of a breeding population of Northern gannets for which we have tracking data.4. A baseline model with no wind farms accurately represented the status of a sample of tracked gannets at the end of the 90-day chick-rearing period, and the behaviour-time budget was similar to that of tracked gannets.5. Model simulations in the presence of wind farms indicated that installations should have little impact on the gannet population, when either avoidance behaviour or collision risk scenarios were simulated. Furthermore, wind farms would need to be ten times larger or in more highly used areas in order to have population-level impacts on Alderney's gannets.6. Synthesis and applications. Our spatially explicit individual-based models (IBM) highlight that it is vital to know the colony-specific foraging grounds of seabirds that may be impacted, when identifying potential wind farm sites, in order to account for cumulative impacts from multiple sites. Avoiding areas highly used for foraging and commuting, and avoiding large-scale developments should be effective in limiting gannet mortality as a result of collision, competition and energy expenditure. Our IBM provides a robust approach which can be adapted for other seabird populations or to predict the impacts from other types of spatial change in the marine environment.",,,,,,,,,21,0,0,0,18,0,23,,,0021-8901,1365-2664,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Liverpool, Sch Environm Sci, Liverpool, Merseyside, EnglandBritish Trust Ornithol, Norfolk, VA USAUniv Liverpool, Ctr Engn Sustainabil, Liverpool, Merseyside, EnglandBritish Antarctic Survey, Cambridge, England",British Trust Ornithol,,,2018-03-01,WOS:000424881800005,,,,,

Dynamically installed anchors (i.e. torpedo anchors and deep penetrating anchor) are increasingly used as a cost-effective solution for floating offshore structures in deep water environments because their installation cost is largely independent of water depth. In addition, dynamically installed anchors can be deployed accurately, and their performance is less dependent on accurate assessment of the soil shear strength since lower seabed strengths permit greater penetration depths. Despite of the economic advantages afforded by dynamically installed anchors, there remain significant uncertainties in the prediction of the embedment depth and verticality, which is likely to affect their long-term holding capacity Currently, the holding capacity of the dynamically installed anchors is assessed using conventional pile capacity techniques, which neglect discrepancies in the rate of installation and failure mechanism between them.This paper presents a series of model tests simulating dynamic installation and monotonic pull-out of dynamically installed anchors in normally consolidated clay. The model tests are carried out in a beam centrifuge at 100g, with varying penetration angles, extraction angles and model masses. A special designed apparatus allows model anchors to be penetrated and extracted with different penetration angles. The test results show that for models without fins, no matter by which angle the model penetrated the soil, the smallest value of holding capacity is obtained when the pullout and penetration directions are the same. Results also indicate that the penetration depth linearly increases with the anchor mass. This study also reported the results from finite element (FE) analyses. The Coupled Eulerian-Lagrangian (CEL) approach in the commercial FE package Abaqus/Explicit is carried out to simulate dynamic anchor installation.The findings of this study points to a method of assessing the minimum holding capacity of the anchor and its depth of penetration.

However, no clear terminology for use-use interactions exists. Thus, an analytical framework for spatial decision support tools (DSTs) to assess use-use interactions is deduced from literature. Four spatial-temporal links are found to either alone or together constitute use-use interactions: location links, environmental links, technical links, and user attraction links. It is found to be important for DSTs to support co-location management in MSP by iteratively through the MSP process 1) spatially-temporally locate spatial-temporal links constituting use-use interactions, 2) list conflicts and synergies of the located use-use interactions, and 3) weight the conflicts and synergies. With this analytical framework, two types of DSTs are analysed for their ability to include co-location; matrix- and ranking-based DSTs to detect conflicts and synergies and space allocating DSTs to avoid/minimise conflicts and optimise synergies. Whereas the first group of tools categorise or rank use-use combinations, the latter group use information about which multi-use combinations are possible as pre-existing knowledge, and thus the two groups of DSTs can advantageously be used together. A discrepancy is found between the co-location framework and the DSTs. It is argued that future tools could work on removing this discrepancy by considering the spatial-temporal links of use-use interactions, strengthen the focus on synergies, as well as prioritize ranking of synergies and conflicts over binary approaches that only evaluate spatial compatibility.",,,,,,,,,13,0,0,0,0,0,13,,,0308-597X,1872-9460,,,,,,,,,,"Aalborg Univ, Dept Planning, Copenhagen Campus, Copenhagen, DenmarkAC Meyers Vaenge 15, DK-2450 Copenhagen SV, Denmark",,,,2019-07-24,WOS:000474313500022,,,,,

SeaMaST is a freely available evidence source for use by all connected to the offshore wind industry and will assist statutory agencies in assessing potential risks to seabird populations from planned developments. Data were compiled from offshore boat and aerial observer surveys spanning the period 1979-2012. The data were analysed using distance analysis and Density Surface Modelling to produce predicted bird densities across a grid covering English territorial waters at a resolution of 3 kmx3 km. Coefficients of Variation were estimated for each grid cell density, as an indication of confidence in predictions. Offshore wind farm sensitivity scores were compiled for seabird species using English territorial waters. The comparative risks to each species of collision with turbines and displacement from operational turbines were reviewed and scored separately, and the scores were multiplied by the bird density estimates to produce relative sensitivity maps. The sensitivity maps reflected well the amassed distributions of the most sensitive species.

This has taken the wind energy industry out of the territory of planning systems that usually govern the siting of wind farms on land, and into the world of departmental, sectoral regulation of marine activities. Although this has favoured the expansion of offshore wind energy in some respects, evidence suggests that the practice and principles of spatial planning can make an important contribution to the proper consideration of proposals for offshore wind arrays. This is especially so when a strategic planning process is put in place for marine areas, in which offshore wind is treated as part of the overall configuration of marine interests, so that adjustments can be made in the interests of wind energy.

A typical example is the turret-moored FPSO (Floating Production Storage & Offloading) . In such a case, the produced crude oil is normally transported by a fleet of shuttle tankers. For the sake of safety, the shuttle tanker during offloading must maintain its position within a certain limit under the action of external forces with the help of conventional mooring system and/or Dynamic Positioning (DP) system. As the water depth increases, the conventional mooring system becomes ineffective and thus the DP system is recommended.In this paper, two important problems are discussed in relation with the design of the DP system. One is to reduce the excessive thruster modulation caused by wave-induced motions and the other is the thrust allocation. The thruster modulation can be reduced by implementing a Kalman filter for the estimation of the low frequency state vector by removing the wave frequency motion from the measured variables. Herein a static algorithm for thrust allocation is suggested in order to improve the thruster performance. The DP controller is designed based on the optimal control theory and also the robust H-infinity control theory. In order to exemplify the process, the nonlinear behavior of shuttle tankers is simulated, where the hydrodynamic forces are calculated by the Green's function method, while the restoring force of mooring lines is approximated by the catenary equation in a quasi-static fashion.Based on numerical simulations, the capability of the designed DP controller and the thruster modulation are examined. Both the controllers can demonstrate that it works well even in an extremely harsh environment and that the algorithm for thrust allocation renders an economic solution. But it is found that the control command contains a certain amount of wave frequency components. Thus a more effective filter needs to be developed to improve the performance of the DP system.",,,,,5th ISOPE Pacific/Asia Offshore Mechanics Symposium5th ISOPE Pacific/Asia Offshore Mechanics Symposium,"NOV 17-20, 2002NOV 17-20, 2002",Inst Soc Offshore & Polar Engineers; Korea Comm Ocean Resources & Engn; Korea Res Inst Ships & Ocean EngnInst Soc Offshore & Polar Engineers; Korea Comm Ocean Resources & Engn; Korea Res Inst Ships & Ocean Engn,"TAEJON, SOUTH KOREATAEJON, SOUTH KOREA",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,1-880653-59-1,,,,,,,,,"Seoul Natl Univ, Dept Naval Architectural & Ocean Engn, Seoul 151742, South Korea",,,,2002-01-01,WOS:000181657500023,,,,,

Many large predators are highly mobile and occur in habitats along a continuum of presence and absence. In many natural systems, the movement of large predators through an area has been shown to lead to rapid changes in prey distribution through trait-mediated behavioral responses. To test whether a similar interaction also occurs for artificial habitats, we examined how reef fish community metrics (abundance, species richness, community composition) varied with the presence of a large coastal shark (sand tiger shark, Carcharias taurus). Remotely operated vehicle surveys of large sharks and reef fishes on shipwrecks along the North Carolina, USA, continental shelf revealed that short-term shark presence correlated with changes in reef fish community metrics. Specifically, when sharks were present, fish species abundance and richness did not differ compared to when sharks were absent. Finer-scale analyses near sharks revealed similar abundance but elevated species richness proximate to sharks. We confirmed that this fine-scale pattern of similar abundance but higher richness near sharks held when the ROV was not in the water by repeating analyses using time-lapse videos from nearby shipwrecks. The detected differences in fish community metrics in the presence of sharks correlated with higher numbers of water-column associated species, such as jacks and barracuda, but lower numbers of benthic-associated species, including seabass and grouper.

Number of species, total abundance and densities of dominant species showed great monthly fluctuations and no clear seasonal patterns of temporal evolution could be detected. Values of diversity and evenness were, in general, high and stable through time. The composition of the assemblage was richer than that of assemblages from similar muddy sediments in other harbour areas from Europe but was poorer than those inhabiting surrounding sandy sediments at the Ensenada de Baiona.

From this perspective, 15 reference points have been selected in the Baltic, Mediterranean and Black seas, representing 5 representative locations for each sea, respectively. The proposed analysis is based on the wind fields provided by a Regional Climate Model (RCM) for the future time period 2021-2050. These data are processed and analysed considering the Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) scenarios 4.5 and 8.5. In the first RCP scenario (4.5), an enhancement of the greenhouse gas emissions until 2040 is considered followed afterwards by a decline. On the other hand, the second scenario assumes that the greenhouse gas emissions enhancement will continue during the entire 21st century and after. The first scenario is considered as the most realistic approach, while the second as the most pessimistic. Furthermore, in order to complete the picture an analysis of the historical wind data coming from the same RCM for the past 30-year period 1976-2005 is also carried out. In this way, a more comprehensive image of the wind power dynamics in the some relevant locations from the European coastal environment is provided. In order to enlarge the perspective, the analysis of the historical data is also extended for some locations in the North Sea, where wind farms already operate. The results indicate a slight enhancement of the average wind power in most of the locations considered. This enhancement appears to be stronger for RCP8.5 than for RCP4.5. On the other hand, the maximum wind power is expected to have much higher peaks for RCP8.5 and this especially concerns the western side of the Black Sea. The work is still on going and the analysis will be extended in both space and time covering more coastal locations and the time period until the end of the 21st century.",,,,,5th International Conference on Advances and Clean Energy Research (ICACER)5th International Conference on Advances and Clean Energy Research (ICACER),"APR 23-25, 2020APR 23-25, 2020",,ELECTR NETWORKELECTR NETWORK,4,0,0,0,0,0,4,,,2267-1242,,*****************,,,,,,,,,"Dunarea de Jos Univ Galati, Dept Mech Engn, Domneasca St 47, Galati 800008, RomaniaDanubius Univ, Danubius Int Business Sch, 3 Galati St, Galati 800654, Romania",,,,2021-01-05,WOS:000591380600002,,,,,

Themain subject of this research, free standing drilling riser (FSDR), is an innovation to the drilling riser that enables rapid disconnection prior to hurricane conditions. This allows the offshore drilling rig and operator to move away from hurricane path prior to hurricane landing. Yet, currently, the emergency disconnection decision ofFSDRis decided by a rig manager. Past incidents have shown that human error can cause catastrophic damage. Studies on FSDR operations under hurricane condition are scarcely available. The most relevant studies, free standing riser (FSR) behaves differently. With the increase in hurricane intensity over the past 50 years, this increases the risk in FSDR operations. In this work, the hydrodynamic response of FSDR under hurricane conditions was investigated. Four simulation studies were conducted in Orcaflex finite element modeling (FEM) software. These studies were conducted to determine the effect of emergency disconnection location, the optimum emergency disconnection location, the effect of various Saffir Simpson maximum significant wave height and hurricane generated swell on the hydrodynamic response of FSDR. Hurricane generated wave spectrum was used to replicate hurricane conditions. The simulation study shows that the lateral displacement of FSDR decreases in a 3rd order polynomial function with the emergency disconnection location, LD=-6e(-6)d(3) + 0.0024d(2) - 0.3348d + 19.179. In addition, the optimum emergency disconnection location along drilling riser line is at 87.50% of the original water depth. The lateral displacement of FSDR increases exponentially with Saffir Simpson scale storm intensity, y = 1.7537e(0.0386x). Lastly, the stronger the swell component of hurricane generated swell, the higher the hydrodynamic responses. Wind wave component of hurricane generated swell did not influence FSDR as the riser was in the free standing mode. The limitation of this research is the findings are applicable for this simulation setup only. Further validations are required with experimental setup and various types of offshore structure.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,1610-2010,,978-3-030-37425-9; 978-3-030-37424-2,,,,,,,,,"Univ Teknol PETRONAS, Offshore Engn Ctr, Bandar Seri Iskandar 32610, MalaysiaUniv Teknol PETRONAS, Dept Mech Engn, Bandar Seri Iskandar 32610, Malaysia",,,,2021-10-14,WOS:000677532400004,,,,,

The first such reef in the Yucatan was created out of a need to dispose of 70 out-of-use shrimp trawlers. At the time, there was no regulation or official rules for the construction of artificial reefs in Mexican waters; therefore, a code of norms was proposed that latter became part of national regulations on the subject. This first reef generated an outstanding increase in fish yields at nearby localities. Subsequently, there was a near-chaotic installation of small reefs by fishermen, which led to a local reef program that established regulations for the disposal of materials in Mexican waters. Three additional localities were identified for the construction of artificial reefs close to the main fishing towns in the state of Campeche. Production (i.e., yields by local fishermen) was enhanced during the first 5 years after deployment of the reefs.

One such species, the colonial ascidian Didemnum vexillum, poses a threat to the highly-valued New Zealand green-lipped mussel industry, and there is interest in whether and to what extent its spread can be managed at a regional scale (< 100 km). An important component in the decision-making process for managing human-mediated pathways of spread is an understanding of D. vexillum's natural dispersal potential. Here we use a weight-of-evidence approach, combining laboratory and field studies, to assess the role of natural dispersal mechanisms in the spread of D. vexillum. Under laboratory conditions, > 70 % of D. vexillum larvae remained viable and were able to settle and undergo metamorphosis successfully following an artificial delay of 2 h. Larval viability decreased with increasing delay duration, although 10 % of larvae remained viable following a 36 h delay. A field-based study documented larval dispersal from two discrete source populations, with recruitment consistently detected on settlement plates at 250 m from source populations at one experimental site. Exponential decay models used to predict maximum larval dispersal distances at this site indicated that dispersal greater than 250 m is theoretically possible (> 1 km in some situations). That being so, we recognise that the successful establishment and persistence of populations will depend on a wide range of processes not taken into account here. Our findings are supported by surveillance of D. vexillum spread in the wider study region; there are a number of instances where the species established on artificial structures that were several kilometres from known source populations, at a time when intensive regional-scale management of anthropogenic vectors was underway. Collectively, our findings indicate that D. vexillum has the ability to spread further by natural dispersal than previously assumed; probably hundreds of metres to kilometres depending on the local hydrological conditions, which has important implications for the ongoing management of this pest species world-wide.",,,,,,,,,20,0,0,0,18,0,21,,,1387-3547,1573-1464,,,,,,,,,,"Cawthron Inst, Nelson 7042, New ZealandVictoria Univ Wellington, Sch Biol Sci, Wellington 6140, New Zealand",,,,2013-03-20,WOS:000315290100015,,,,,

Coastal cities support vast expanses of buildings and roads along the coast or on reclaimed land, leading to armouring of shorelines with walls, revetments and offshore structures to reduce erosion and flooding. Currently infrastructure is designed to meet engineering and financial criteria, without considering its value as habitat, despite artificial shorelines causing loss of intertidal species and altering ecological natural processes that sustain natural biodiversity. Most research on ameliorating these impacts focus on soft-sediment habitats and larger flora (e.g., restoring marshes, encouraging plants to grow on walls). In response to needs for greater collaboration between ecologists and engineers to create infrastructure to better support biodiversity, we show how such collaborations lead to small-scale and inexpensive ecologically informed engineering which reduces loss of species of algae and animals from rocky shores replaced by walls. Adding experimental novel habitats to walls mimicking rock-pools (e.g., cavities, attaching flowerpots) increased numbers of species by 110% within months, in particular mobile animals most affected by replacing natural shores with walls.

In this study, we present a method that makes best use of the currently limited understanding of displacement impacts. The combination of a matrix table displaying the full range of potential displacement and mortality levels together with seasonal potential biological removal (PBR) assessments provides a tool that increases confidence in the conclusions of impact assessments. If unrealistic displacement levels arid/or mortality rates are required to equal or approach seasonal PBRs, this gives an indication of the likeliness of adverse impacts on the assessed population. This approach is demonstrated by assessing the displacement impacts of an offshore wind farm cluster in the German North Sea on the local common guillemot (Uric aalge) population.

Pipelines are buried to the seabed to be protected from damages caused by hydrodynamic forces or human activities. The pipeline laid on movable bed can be buried due to local scouring. A vertical plate on pipeline, called spoiler, has been developed to increase the rate and extend of scouring. In this study, the two-dimensional turbulent flow around a smooth pipeline with a spoiler was investigated at Re-D = 9500 near the bed. The governing equations for the current problem were solved using ANSYS (R) 11.0-Flotran program package based on finite element method. The performance of the standard k-epsilon, standard k-omega, and shear stress transport turbulence models were examined on five computational meshes with different densities. The results obtained were compared with the published experimental measurements in literature. Present results showed that the attachment of a spoiler caused a large separation area in both upstream and downstream of the pipeline. The attachment of spoiler on top of the pipe increased the drag and decreased the lift force on pipe. Moreover, the spoiler causes non-zero downward lift.

These structures can create novel habitats in areas normally characterised as void of suitable settlement sites. The habitat requirements of the invasive acorn barnacle Austrominius modestus (Darwin, 1854) were assessed using a novel sampling site at Crosby Beach, Liverpool. Austrominius modestus has spread rapidly around the UK since its initial introduction, becoming locally dominant in many estuarine areas including the Antony Gormley art installation, 'Another Place', at Crosby Beach. The installation consists of 100 replicate solid cast-iron life-size human figures, located at a range of heights on the shore. We recorded the distribution and abundance of A. modestus present on all of the statues at various positions during the summer of 2006. The positions varied in location, exposure, direction, and rugosity. Although parameters such as rugosity and exposure did influence patterns of recruitment, they were less important than interactions between shore height and direction, and specific location on the beach. The addition of a suitable substrate to a sheltered and estuarine region of Liverpool Bay has facilitated the establishment of A. modestus. Understanding the habitat requirements of invasive species is important if we are to make predictions about their spread and the likelihood of invasion success. Austrominius modestus has already become locally dominant in some regions of the UK and, with projections of favourable warming conditions and the global expansion of artificial structures, the continued spread of this species can be expected.

From a spatial planning perspective, this has not been a straight-forward process, due to substantial spatial conflicts with the traditional users of the sea, especially with fisheries and protected areas. In this article, we examine the availability of offshore space for wind farm deployment, from a transnational perspective, while taking into account different options for the management of the maritime area through four scenarios. We applied a mixed-method approach, combining expert knowledge and document analysis with the spatial visualisation of existing and future maritime spatial claims. Our calculations clearly indicate a low availability of suitable locations for offshore wind in the proximity of the shore and in shallow waters, even when considering its multi-use with fisheries and protected areas. However, the areas within 100 km from shore and with a water depth above -120 m attract greater opportunities for both single use (only offshore wind farms) and multi-use (mainly with fisheries), from an integrated planning perspective. On the other hand, the decrease of energy targets combined with sectoral planning result in clear limitations to suitable areas for offshore wind farms, indicating the necessity to consider areas with a water depth below -120 m and further than 100 km from shore. Therefore, despite the increased costs of maintenance and design adaptation, the multi-use of space can be a solution for more sustainable, stakeholder-engaged and cost-effective options in the energy deployment process.

The paper will propose a combination of a SAR helicopter and multipurpose emergency response vessels. The paper will illustrate improved search and rescue capacity both for personnel involved in the petroleum industry and others i.e., fisheries, maritime transport and tourism.The basis for this paper is petroleum exploration activity in the far North Eastern area of the Norwegian sector of the Barents Sea. The area is currently being evaluated in a process that most probably will lead to opening the area for oil and gas exploration. There is currently little or no infrastructure in the area beyond the coast. The paper considers a method to provide SAR coverage over a distance of 260 nautical miles with a minimum rescue capacity of 21 persons within two hours.Issues related to survival in cold water, immersion survival suits and performance requirements for search and rescue resources will be considered in order to provide an optimum combination and enhanced probability of survival if an incident should occur.Operational considerations involving departure criteria for helicopter transport should be developed in order to ensure that persons travelling on a helicopter to remote locations in the Barents Sea have a reasonable prospect of surviving a helicopter ditching and subsequently being rescued.Multipurpose Emergency Response Vessels, ERVs, equipped with dual Fast Recovery Daughter Craft, FRDC, capable of operating in an Arctic climate deployed at the remote location and en route together with an onshore based search and rescue, SAR, helicopter may provide a rescue capacity for 21 persons within 120 minutes.As vessels of the type proposed in this paper may be of a benefit to all stakeholders performing activities in the Barents Sea, joint venture financing by the authorities, petroleum, maritime, fishing and tourism industries could be considered.",,,,,"32nd ASME International Conference on Ocean, Offshore and Arctic Engineering32nd ASME International Conference on Ocean, Offshore and Arctic Engineering","JUN 09-14, 2013JUN 09-14, 2013","ASME, Ocean Offshore & Arctic Engn DivASME, Ocean Offshore & Arctic Engn Div","Nantes, FRANCENantes, FRANCE",2,0,0,0,0,0,2,,,,,978-0-7918-5540-9,,,,,,,,,"Petr Safety Author, Stavanger, NorwayUniv Stavanger, Marine Technol, Stavanger, Norway",Petr Safety Author,,,2013-01-01,WOS:000360867600013,,,,,

The ODVC strategy uses Continuous Action Reinforcement Learning Automata (CARLA) to optimize power flows in real time. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed control method, dynamic simulations are carried out using a MTdc grid model composed of six nodes, interconnecting three offshore wind farms to three European countries. The results obtained demonstrate the advantages of implementing an online distributed voltage control strategy to obtain feasible controlled power flows with low transmission losses.

As these structures are decommissioned, they must be removed; however, some are converted to permanent artificial reefs. Despite the potential effects these artificial habitats may have on marine fisheries, investigations that assess the fish communities inhabiting these structures relative to natural habitats are rare. During fall 2012, we used remotely operated vehicle surveys to compare fish communities between artificial reefs (i.e., reefed platforms; n = 5) and adjacent natural banks (n = 5) in the western GOM. Our surveys successfully documented 79 species representing 28 families. Multivariate analyses suggested that fish communities at artificial reefs were distinct from those at natural banks. Post hoc analyses indicated that the differences were driven by high abundances of transient, midwater pelagics and other gregarious species at artificial reefs. Many fisheries species, like the Red Snapper Lutjanus campechanus, were found in both habitat types, with density at artificial reefs estimated to be nearly eight times greater than at natural banks. Despite lower densities at natural banks, the disproportionately large areas of these habitats resulted in relatively high total abundance estimates-approximately 5% of the 2012 GOM Red Snapper annual catch limit (3.67 million kg [8.08 million lb])-a finding that has significant implications for Red Snapper and artificial reef management in the GOM. Our study suggests that although fish community structure may differ between these two habitats, artificial reefs serve as important habitat for species like Red Snapper by potentially diverting fishing pressure from natural habitats; however, future studies that address species-specific life history traits will be needed to better understand the function and performance of artificial reefs in supporting fisheries productivity.",,,,,,,,,34,0,0,0,28,0,40,,,1942-5120,,,,,,,,,,,"Texas A&M Univ, Harte Res Inst Gulf Mexico Studies, Unit 5869, 6300 Ocean Dr, Corpus Christi, TX 78412 USAFlorida Atlantic Univ, Harbor Branch Oceanog Inst, 5600 US 1 North, Ft Pierce, FL 34946 USA",,,,2018-12-28,WOS:000407996400014,,,,,

Differences were minimal among these four groups of yellowfin tuna in the frequency of occurrence of important prey in their diets. Diurnal patterns in the stomach fullness and the frequency of occurrence of some prey in the diet indicate that these yellowfin tuna are not feeding at night and that they may prey on vertically migrating mesopelagic organisms during crepuscular periods.

However, some sea areas may serve functions other than providing nutritional resources, which may be equally relevant, particularly if used by large numbers of individuals. In this paper, based on a study of 4 breeding colonies in the Falkland Islands and on 314 individuals tracked, we show that virtually all (97.8%) black-browed albatrosses Thalassarche melanophris (BBA) bathe in the close vicinity of the colony, remaining in the area for nearly an hour, before departing on a foraging trip. This compares with only 20 to 40% of the individuals landing close to the colony at the end of a foraging trip. The observed utilization of marine areas by BBA in a radius of 1 to 5 km around the nesting colony is one order of magnitude higher than elsewhere, including foraging hotspots. Clearly, even long-range flying birds such as albatrosses can make an intensive use of the sea-surface in the immediate vicinity of the colonies, and therefore any threats to seabirds in these areas (disturbance, pollutants, collision with artificial structures and light attraction) can potentially have a major impact at the population level. As such, the close neighbourhood of seabird colonies are potentially highly sensitive areas, and this needs to be taken into account when carrying out risk assessments or during marine spatial planning exercises.",,,,,,,,,8,0,0,0,8,0,10,,,0959-2709,1474-0001,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Lisbon, CESAM, Dept Biol Anim, Fac Ciencias, P-1749016 Lisbon, PortugalISPA Inst Univ, MARE Marine & Environm Sci Ctr, Rua Jardim Tabaco 34, P-1149041 Lisbon, Portugal",,,,2018-12-28,WOS:000452085300003,,,,,

Substructures of a wind turbine should have due rigidity and strength with the configuration as to ward off wind loads. Since fluctuating winds, waves and various mechanical vibrations are acting on them, resonance evasion, reduction of those excitation and fatigue damage are required. So we have proposed a steel tube truss alternative to a conventional steel cylindrical tower for fixed bottom or floating facilities. To confirm the applicability, we carried out design of both substructures onto a 5MW wind generator, a wind tunnel model experiment and numerical study taken the pile and soil interaction into consideration. Finally, we concluded as follows ;1)The substructures made of a truss tower composed of small number of members having small diameter and jacket is better than a cylindrical tower and monopile. Although the weight of steel materials is larger about 1.7 times, the flexural rigidity is appropriately 1.5 times. This implies that proposed substructure takes advantage from the fatigue perspective.2)The first natural period of 2.5s obtained by the eigenvalue analyses can be longer than the period of 1.0-2.0s that a rotating blade intersects the tower, and shorter than rotating period of 3.0-6.0s. These periods pertaining to tower shadow effects due to wake bring varying member forces. Thereby, the optimal design avoiding the resonance from the natural period of the facility may be done.3)The measured out-of-plane accelerations and oscillation loads in the truss tower were smaller than those of the cylinder tower. The electricity generated by the truss tower is slightly larger.4)The truss tower with jacket foundation has enough ductility, such that it can deform four or five times during collapse compared with the deformation at yielding by a pushover analysis.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,17560432,,,,,,,,Tokai University,,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:14859760,,,,,

It has a chain of 21 low-lying uninhabited islands extending from Rameswaram to Tuticorin. These islands are endowed with coral reefs, beds of seagrasses, and other associated marine life. Growing human population has led to accelerated coral mining and destructive fishing practices and this has brought about changes in the bio-geomorphology of the islands, altered the hydrodynamic conditions, and resulted in severe erosion of the islands. The area of Vaan Island had decreased from 20.8 ha in 1969 to 2.33 ha in 2015. While hard measures have proven successful in preventing erosion, ecosystem-based measures taking into account the resilience of the flora and fauna yield greater and more natural benefits. A total of 10,600 perforated trapezoidal artificial reef (AR) modules were deployed in clusters along two rows on the windward side of Vaan Island. ARs of 1 and 2 m height were placed respectively along contours of 2 and 3 m depth. The shape and arrangement of the ARs dissipated wave energy through the shoaling effect. As a result, a spit appeared and the area increased to 3.15 ha. The ARs also support epibenthic communities, benthic macrofauna, corals, and fishes. The deployment of an ecosystem-based multipurpose perforated trapezoidal AR model has been successful not only in restoring the sinking island but also in enhancing the species richness, and it can be adopted as a tool in the restoration of islands and their marine ecosystems.",,,,,,,,,15,1,0,0,8,0,16,,,1061-2971,1526-100X,,,,,,,,,,"Govt Tamil Nadu, Dept Environm, Chennai, Tamil Nadu, IndiaSuganthi Devadason Marine Res Inst, Tuticorin, IndiaGulf Mannar Marine Natl Pk, Ramanathapuram, IndiaIndian Inst Technol Madras, Chennai, Tamil Nadu, India",Govt Tamil NaduSuganthi Devadason Marine Res InstGulf Mannar Marine Natl Pk,,,2019-12-06,WOS:000498137400001,,,,,

This concerns both the transformation of the wave field velocities and accelerations to forces on the structure and the probabilistic description of the wave field itself. In this paper the last issue is in focus. The modeling follows the traditional structure of subdividing the time development of the wind driven wave process into sea states within each of which the wave process is modeled as a stationary process. The wave process of each sea state is modeled as an affinity in height and time of a Gaussian process defined by a normalized dimensionless spectrum of Pierson-Moskowitz type. The affinity factors are the so-called significant wave height H-s and the characteristic zero upcrossing time T-z. Based on measured data of (H-s, T-z) from the North Sea a well fitting joint distribution of (H-s,T-z) is obtained as a so-called Nataf model. Since the wave field is wind driven, there is a correlation between the time averaged wind velocity pressure Q and the characteristic wave height in the stationary situation. Using the Poisson process model to concentrate on those load events that are of importance for the evaluation of the safety of the structure, that is, events with Q larger than some threshold q(0), available information about the wind velocity pressure distribution in high wind situations can be used to formulate a Nataf model for the joint conditional distribution of (H-s, T-z, Q) given that Q > q(0). The distribution of the largest wave height during a sea state is of interest for designing the free space between the sea level and the top side. An approximation to this distribution is well known for a Gaussian process and by integration over all sea states given Q > q(0), the distribution is obtained that is relevant for the free space design. However, for the forces on the members of the structure also the wave period is essential. Within the linear wave theory (Airy waves) the drag term in the Morison force formula increases by the square of the ratio between the wave height and the wave length, and the mass force term increases proportional to the ratio of the wave height and the square of the period. For a strongly narrow band Gaussian process Longuet-Higgins has derived a joint distribution of the height and the period. However, simulations show that the Pierson-Moskowitz spectrum (or any other standard spectrum for wind driven sea waves of similar bandwidth such as the JONSWAP spectrum) does not provide a sufficiently narrow banded process for the distribution of Longuet-Higgins to make a good fit. Surprisingly it turns out that the random time L between two consecutive 0-upcrossings and the random wave height H observed between the two 0-upcrossings behave such that L and the ratio H/L are practically uncorrelated and both normally distributed except for clipping the negative tails. This result is of global nature and is therefore very difficult if not impossible to obtain by analytical mathematical reasoning. Finally, by combining all the derived distributional models into a Rosenblatt transformation, a first order reliability analysis of a tubular offshore platform can be made with respect to static pushover. Correction For non-linear wave theory can be taken into account crudely by using the deterministic 5th order Stokes wave in the limit state formulation.A dynamic analysis will be more complicated, of course, but the provided distributional information and the demonstrated modeling principles are judged as generally applicable.

Ageing is characterised by deterioration, change in operational conditions or accidental damages which, in the severe operational environment offshore, can be significant with serious consequences for installation integrity if not managed adequately and efficiently. An oil field consisting of twelve well head platforms, a living quarter platform (XQ), a flare platform (XFP) and a processing platform (XPA) are the focus of this paper, providing an overview of the integrity assessment process.In order to ensure technical and operational integrity of these ageing facilities, the fitness for service of these offshore structures needs to be maintained. Assessments of the structural integrity of thirteen identified platforms under existing conditions were undertaken as these platforms are either nearing the end of their design life or have exceeded more than 50% of their design life.Information on history, characteristic data, condition data and inspection results were collected to assess the current state and to predict the future state of the facility for possible life extension. The information included but was not limited to as built data, brown fields modifications, additional risers and clamp-on conductors and incorporation of subsea and topside inspection findings.In-service integrity assessments, pushover analyses, corrosion control and cathodic protection assessments and weight control reports were completed to evaluate the integrity of these facilities for requalification to 2019 and life extension to 2030. The analytical models and calculations were updated based on the most recent inspection results and weight control reports. A requalification and life extension report was prepared for each platform to outline the performance criteria acceptance to achieve requalification until 2019 and life extension until 2030.This paper documents the methodology to assess the platform structural integrity in order to evaluate platform integrity for the remaining and extended design life. An overview of various aspects of ageing related to these offshore facilities, representing risk to the integrity, the required procedures and re assessment criteria for deciding on life extension of these facilities is presented.This paper also provides an overall view of the structural requirements, justifications and calibrations of the original design for the life extension to maintain the safety level by means of maintenance and inspection programs balancing the ageing mechanisms and improving the reliability of assessment results.",,,,,"32nd ASME International Conference on Ocean, Offshore and Arctic Engineering32nd ASME International Conference on Ocean, Offshore and Arctic Engineering","JUN 09-14, 2013JUN 09-14, 2013","ASME, Ocean Offshore & Arctic Engn DivASME, Ocean Offshore & Arctic Engn Div","Nantes, FRANCENantes, FRANCE",3,0,0,0,0,0,3,,,,,978-0-7918-5533-1,,,,,,,,,"WorleyParsons, Melbourne, Vic, Australia",WorleyParsons,,,2013-01-01,WOS:000360513100014,,,,,

The capacity of coastal ecosystems, like marshes and oyster reefs, to maintain their own habitat and grow with sea-level rise via biophysical feedbacks is seen as an important advantage of such systems compared to man-made hard engineering structures.Providing a suitable substrate for oysters to settle on offers a kick-start for establishment at places where they were lost or are desirable for coastal protection. Accumulation of shell material, through recruitment and growth, is essential to the maintenance of oyster reefs as it provides substrate for new generations (positive feedback loop), forming a self-sustainable structure. Insight in establishment, survival and growth thresholds and knowledge about the population dynamics are necessary to successfully implement oyster reefs in coastal defence schemes.The aim of this paper is to investigate whether artificial Pacific oyster reefs develop into self-sustaining oyster reefs that contribute to coastal protection. Reef development was investigated by studying recruitment, survival and growth rates of oysters on artificial oyster reefs in comparison with nearby natural Pacific oyster reefs. The artificial reef structure successfully offered substrate for settlement of oysters and therefore stimulated reef formation. Reef development, however, was hampered by local sedimentation and increasing tidal emersion. Tidal emersion is an important factor that can be used to predict where artificial oyster reefs have the potential to develop into self-sustaining reefs that could contribute to coastal protection, but it is also a limiting factor in using oyster reefs for coastal protection.

The tool was developed using C + + and runs on a PC under MS Windows. It has a generic architecture and can be easily extended to other environments with different characteristics, e.g. hospitals, commercial buildings, etc. We use frames to represent a person's characteristics and their perception of the environment; scripts are used to define typical behaviours for particular situations. Our tool can be used to predict the likely behaviours of a population in hazardous situations and help evaluate the effectiveness of emergency procedures and training. We have worked with our collaborators to integrate our decision model with their model of people's movement to produce a system that can realistically simulate emergency scenarios on offshore structures. We believe that this is the first egress and evacuation modelling tool to incorporate both decision making and movement modelling. Our work is therefore an important step in the introduction of improved approaches to the evaluation of offshore safety management. Validating the decision model proved difficult because of lack of suitable data. We acquired additional data by interviewing offshore personnel and monitoring a mustering exercise. We then simulated an offshore emergency scenario and the results were encouraging. In the future we would like to enhance our model by incorporating communication between personnel.

The RK study site was situated within a fish farm located in New Zealands Marlborough Sounds region (41°12'40.2S, 174°08'26.1E), whereas the NN site was situated approximately 60 km west (41°15'23.7S 173°16'33.7E) within a commercial port at Nelson. The RK site was in relatively deep water (c. 30 m depth), while the NN site was shallower (c. 5 m depth) with a large (c. 4 m) tidal exchange.Arrays of roughened black Perspex settlement plates (20 x 20 cm; n = 3 plates per array) were deployed from floating structures at each site (steel fish farm pontoons at RK and plastic marina pontoons at NN), with arrays spaced approximately 5 m apart. The settlement plates were positioned horizontally within each array, and configured to ensure they remained at a constant depth (0.5 - 1.5 m) with respect to the water surface. Sampling involved taking photographs of the downward-facing surface of each plate, reflecting the orientation where maximum D. vexillum recruitment occurs [32]. Plate photos were analysed using the random dot method in Coral Point Count software (CPCe v4.1), with 50 stratified random points overlaid on each image. Based on the frequency of occurrence of D. vexillum, other major taxa, bare space, or sediment at each point, percent cover was calculated. A margin of 1 cm around each experimental plate was excluded from analyses to avoid edge effects.In a second concurrent study (Fletcher et al. data2.csv), we investigated the establishment and persistence of D. vexillum following exposure of settlement plates to ambient larval recruitment, compared with plates also exposed to larval recruitment, but to which a fragment of colony tissue was also attached. The treatments consisted of 10 blank settlement plates (Recruitment treatment) and 10 blank plates to which a D. vexillum fragment was attached to the downward-facing side (Fragment treatment). Hence, whereas all plates were exposed to ambient larval recruitment, half of them were additionally subjected to a single fragment inoculation event.

This study explores the influence of seasonality on succession in the macrofouling assemblage of a Patagonian harbour (Argentina, Southwest Atlantic). Replicated artificial substrata were suspended horizontally and sampled at quarterly intervals during 1 year. The influence of seasonality on 1-year-old assemblages was further analysed using additional sets of replicated panels submersed at different seasons and collected 1 year later. Upper surfaces were always dominated by ephemeral algae, while lower surfaces exhibited high coverage of filter-feeding invertebrates. Regardless of submersion length, species richness was significantly higher on lower than on upper surfaces. A significant interaction between orientation and submersion length was found for the Shannon diversity index, meaning that temporal changes in diversity depended on substratum orientation. On the lower surfaces, diversity reached a maximum after 9 months and then declined, mainly due to extensive dislodgment of two species of ascidians. On algal-dominated upper surfaces, differences in structure of annual assemblages were due to seasonal changes in the abundance of ephemeral algae.

To demonstrate the methodology of the geospatial analysis, diverse datasets on artificial reefs, such as fish-school characteristics, marine-environmental information from a conductivity, temperature, and depth sensor, information on artificial reefs, seabed geographic information, and sediment information around the reefs, were utilized. The habitat preference of fish schools was demonstrated quantitatively. The acoustic density of fish schools is described with respect to the closest distance from reefs and the preferred reef depths, the relationship between fish schools and environmental information was visualized in three dimensions, and the current condition of the reefs and their connection to seabed type is represented.

Significant dissimilarities were observed in the composition, percentage of benthic cover of predominant taxonomic groups and development of the epibenthic communities. Differences in physical and chemical parameters between sides lay mainly in the nutrient and thermal regimes affecting the shipwrecks and most likely bring about the differences in the observed community structure.

Considerable analysis has been undertaken to model navigational risks to vessel traffic around wind farms; however this work is generally predictive and there is little understanding as to whether the modelling, central to the consideration of navigation safety, accurately reflects the post-constructed navigation risks. It is therefore important for decision makers to understand the uncertainties present in the analysis, both in terms of the assessment of risk and the implementation of any risk reduction measures. This paper presents a comparative analysis of the change in vessel traffic in the Thames Estuary before and after the construction of five offshore wind farms. The analysis demonstrates how the impact on vessel traffic is specific to the location of each development, driven by traffic management measures and other local constraints. Therefore the accurate modelling of this impact requires the input of experienced navigators, regulators and other knowledgeable stakeholders. The results of this analysis can be used to improve the predictive modelling of vessel traffic around offshore wind farms and other offshore installations, leading to a reduction in the uncertainty of vessel traffic modelling in the future.",,,,,,,,,24,1,0,0,2,0,25,,,1733-8670,2392-0378,,,,,,,,,,"Marico Marine, Marine & Risk Consultants Ltd, Southampton SO43 7JB, Hants, England",Marico Marine,,,2015-01-01,WOS:000421608000013,,,,,

For free-living fish and motile invertebrates, the natural mortality rate often descends steeply with size and age toward maturity, but from simple simulations, the fractal properties of structurally complex marine habitats suggest that mortality rates may rise again for older, crevice-dependent fishes. That natural cover for commercial-sized organisms is limited can be inferred from the rapid colonization of artificial reefs. Estimating hole-size availability in the local environment could be important in optimizing crevice sizes prior to installing artificial reefs.For shelter-dependent animals, competition for the progressively fewer large crevices predicted by fractal theory will inevitably increase, given longer residence times for older fishes. This may lead to migration or a rise in predation mortality, and eventually lead to a production bottleneck for larger fishes. This could explain the effectiveness of large-scale deployment of artificial reefs with large crevice sizes, but also the potential they have for overexploitation if access to artificial reefs by fishers is not controlled. Nonetheless, installing artificial reefs within reserves, with crevice sizes adjusted for the dimensions of mature fishes, could help compensate for natural habitat deficiencies and create spawning refugia supplying recruits to adjacent areas.The possibility of production bottlenecks was investigated, reanalyzing size-frequency data from an unfished population, and applying a new method of checking size frequencies based on fractal theory that calculates the scaling coefficient Q, which is the rate of decline in log numbers with size. This procedure helps identify bottlenecks in habitat availability, judging from the intersection of quasi-linear segments of log-size frequency plots. Size-frequency data for an unexploited reef area suggest that, for some smaller reef fishes, trends in log numbers at size may reflect fractal expectation (Mandelbrot, 1983). For larger specimens, steep declines in numbers at size suggest that cover was limited, and predation or migration were occurring well before the maximum size for the species was reached.",,,,,9th International Conference on Artificial Reefs and Related Aquatic Habitats (CARAH)9th International Conference on Artificial Reefs and Related Aquatic Habitats (CARAH),"NOV 08-13, 2009NOV 08-13, 2009",,"Curitiba, BRAZILCuritiba, BRAZIL",7,0,0,0,7,0,7,,,2154-7769,,978-1-4398-2008-7; 978-1-4398-2007-0,,,,,,,,,,,,,2011-01-01,WOS:000356919700004,,,,,

In this regard, there are increasing operational demands for offshore structures performing in depth with long distance transportation. Drill ships are one of the representative structures commonly employed for the development of energy resources in deep sea. However, these drilling systems are exposed to the various loadings and harsh environment. Therefore, current design code and standards are very conservative to take account of such conditions. The riser stanchions for the staking the riser are one of the structure that installed on the riser deck platform of drill ship. In transit or operating conditions, the riser load is applied to the stanchion. Therefore, the required strength of stanchion enough to withstand the riser loads and should be designed to meet owner and classification requirements. However, the currently practice design loads, which has been widely used in the shipyard and manufacture industries are too conservative resulting in excessive structural weight. In this regard, the purpose of this study is to propose a rational calculation procedure for the design of cost effective and lightweight stanchion structures.This study used a pyramid stacking type of arrangement for the investigation of the effects of stanchion by riser self weight and hull acceleration. First, the riser loads based on the current conventional design practice is compared with the results obtained by non-linear finite element analysis. In the finite element simulation, contact and damping conditions of stacked risers are explicitly considered. Second, the calculation of riser loads in transverse direction is not easy due to the difficulty associated with considering transverse hull acceleration. Therefore, a new design guideline is presented in a strength calculation of the stanchion structure against to the estimated design loads.",,,,,"35th ASME International Conference on Ocean, Offshore and Arctic Engineering (OMAE)35th ASME International Conference on Ocean, Offshore and Arctic Engineering (OMAE)","JUN 19-24, 2016JUN 19-24, 2016","Amer Soc Mech Engineers, Ocean Offshore & Arctic Engn Div; Amer Soc Mech EngineersAmer Soc Mech Engineers, Ocean Offshore & Arctic Engn Div; Amer Soc Mech Engineers","Busan, SOUTH KOREABusan, SOUTH KOREA",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,978-0-7918-4998-9,,,,,,,,,"Pusan Natl Univ, Pusan, South KoreaInnoQual Co Ltd, Busan, South Korea",InnoQual Co Ltd,,,2017-03-01,WOS:000393091000045,,,,,

This power source features many advantages such as accessibility, inexhaustibility and sustainability, and its harvest and conversion have experienced a rapid growth in both developed and developing countries. The present study aims to geographically analyze the distribution and intensity of onshore wind resources (assessed using the wind power density parameter) globally, continentally and nationally. Using the most recent and detailed global spatial data on wind power density, which were classified after NREL (National Renewable Energy Laboratory) in seven potential classes, our results showed that, globally, there are five major hotspots of abundant wind resources, delimited based on the large-scale presence of the most favourable potential classes, i.e. Excellent (500-600 W/m(2)), Outstanding (600-800 W/m(2)) and Superb (>800 W/m(2)), also called in our paper EOS classes. These hotspots consist of the central-northern region of North America, southern South America, northern/north-western Europe, northern Asia and the central-south-eastern region of the Asian continent. These regions bring together most of the entire global area of EOS classes, which totals similar to 4 mil km(2) or similar to 3% of the world's land area. Continentally, the most extensive EOS areas are found in Asia (similar to 1.5 mil km(2), 3.5% of the continent), followed by North and Central America (similar to 1 mil km(2), 4.3%), South America (similar to 0.7 mil km(2), 4.1%), Europe (similar to 0.5 mil km(2), 5%), Africa (similar to 0.1 mil km(2), 0.4%), and Australia and Oceania (similar to 0.1 mil km(2), 1.3%). Nationally, it was found there are 8 epicentre-countries for wind potential (with absolute EOS areas that range between 0.1 and almost 1 mil km(2) across the countries), namely China (similar to 0.9 mil km(2), 10% of the country), followed by Canada (similar to 0.6 mil km(2), 6%), the United States (similar to 0.5 mil km(2), 5%), Argentina (similar to 0.4 mil km(2), 14%), Russia (similar to 0.4 mil km(2) in total, in Europe and Asia, 2%), Chile (similar to 0.2 mil km(2), 28%), Norway (similar to 0.1 mil km(2), 30%) and Afghanistan (similar to 0.1 mil km(2), 16%). Results show these countries are the most suitable for large-scale wind power installations in the world. Also, our findings not only provide an overall image of wind resources availability worldwide, but they can also be a useful tool for the transition towards a carbon-free global economy, by helping world governments better understand and subsequently use their wind resources at regional or local levels.

In general, human impacts on benthic habitats are poorly understood.Habitat mapping provides condition assessments and establishes baselines against which changes can be measured. GeoHab scientists ranked the impacts on benthic habitats from fishing as the greatest threat, followed by pollution and litter, aggregate mining, oil and gas, coastal development, tourism, cables, shipping, invasive species, climate change, and construction of wind farms.

Increased seston concentrations, which decrease light penetration, are likely one of the main causes of the decline in Chesapeake Bay. It has been hypothesized that dense populations of suspension-feeding bivalves, such as eastern oysters (Crassostrea virginica), may filter sufficient seston from the water to reduce light attenuation and enhance seagrass growth. Furthermore, eastern oyster populations can form large three-dimensional reef-like structures that may act like breakwaters by attenuating waves, thus decreasing sediment resuspension. We developed a quasi-three-dimensional Seagrass-Waves-Oysters-Light-Seston (SWOLS) model to investigate whether oyster reefs and breakwaters could improve seagrass growth by reducing seston concentrations. Seagrass growth potential (SGP), a parameter controlled by resuspension-induced turbidity, was calculated in simulations in which wave height, oyster abundance, and reef/breakwater configuration were varied. Wave height was the dominant factor influencing SGP, with higher waves increasing sediment resuspension and decreasing SGP. Submerged breakwaters parallel with the shoreline improved SGP in the presence of 0.2 and 0.4 m waves when sediment resuspension was dominated by wave action, while submerged groins perpendicular to the shoreline improved SGP under lower wave heights (0.05 and 0.1 m) when resuspension was dominated by along-shore tidal currents. Oyster-feeding activity did not affect SGP, due to the oysters' distance from the seagrass bed and reduced oyster filtration rates under either low or high sediment concentrations. Although the current implementation of the SWOLS model has simplified geometry, the model does demonstrate that the interaction between oyster filtration and along-shore circulation, and between man-made structures and wave heights, should be considered when managing seagrass habitats, planning seagrass restoration projects, and choosing the most suitable methods to protect shorelines from erosion.",,,,,,,,,25,0,0,0,19,0,35,,,1559-2723,1559-2731,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Maryland, Ctr Environm Sci, Horn Point Lab, Cambridge, MD 21613 USAUniv Delaware, Ctr Appl Coastal Res, Newark, DE 19716 USA",,,,2009-07-01,WOS:000266815300012,,,,,

The empirical results identify three stakeholder segments: (I) impact-attend group; (2) comprehensive group; and (3) benefit-attend group. The results suggest that communication should be implemented to alter stakeholders' attitudes toward the construction of OWFs. Furthermore, based on the results of segmentation, target markets are identified to plan the communication strategies for reducing the conflicts among stakeholders of OWF construction. The results also indicated that in the planning phase of construction for OWFs, effective stakeholder participation and policy communication can enhance the perception of benefits to reduce conflict with local communities and ocean users.

When the keel of an iceberg exceeds water depth it ploughs through soft sediments producing scours/ploughmarks that can be kilometres long, hundreds of metres wide and sometimes tens of metres deep. Because the influence of iceberg keels on sediment is a critical factor when offshore structures (e.g. pipelines, power cables) are installed, the surface morphology of iceberg scours on the seafloor is relatively well-documented. Less however, is known about sub-scour deformation below the seafloor. This is particularly true of iceberg scoured diamicton (poorly sorted sediment comprising a variety of particle sizes), which is present in many high-latitude fjords and continental shelves. The aim of this research is to examine directly (macroscopically and microscopically, with thin sections) the style and intensity of deformation caused by the scouring action of iceberg keels in diamicton offshore of East Greenland. Results show that a distinctive suite of deformation structures (individual structures and overprinted structural patterns) dominated by planar shear, sediment mixing and high porewater, and dropstones characterises iceberg scoured diamicton. In addition, diamicton from areas of high-intensity iceberg scouring tends to show a wider variety, higher frequency and distribution, more abundant and better-developed deformation structures than diamicton from areas of intermediate- and low-intensity iceberg scouring. Characterising the effects of iceberg scour in diamicton is important more widely to inform: i) reconstruction of the geometry and dynamics of former ice sheets; and ii) installation and protection of offshore engineering structures in diamicton where iceberg scouring presents a geohazard. The value of micromorphology is significant especially in the absence of macroscopic sediment exposures/outcrops where the study of cores is necessary instead. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

As a result of these cyclic loads, excessive differential or absolute settlements may be induced during the piles' service life. In the research presented here, centrifuge modelling of single piles and pile groups was conducted to investigate the influence of cyclic axial loads on the performance of piled foundations. The influence of installation method was investigated and it was found that the cyclic response of a pile whose jacked installation was modelled correctly is much stiffer than that of a bored pile. During displacement-controlled axial load cycling, the pile head stiffness reduces with an increasing number of cycles, but at a decreasing rate; during force-controlled axial load cycling, more permanent settlement is accumulated for a bored pile than for a jacked pile. The performance of individual piles in a pile group subjected to cyclic axial loads is similar to that of a single pile, without any evident group effect. Finally, a numerical analysis of axially loaded piles was validated by centrifuge test results.

There are numerous records of artificial structures, tourists, economic exploitation, altogether with the combined effects of global climate changes. In this scenario, one of the most fragile and sensitive environments are the sandy beaches. These areas harbor a particular biodiversity that suffer negative effects of increased coastal urbanization. Changes in sediment, artificial structures, trampling and vehicle circulation are some of the various impacts that affect these environments. In this context, the proper management of this environment requires basic information, such as morphodynamics and biodiversity. The Baixada Santista, located on the central coast of the State of São Paulo, is a model area for the evaluation of the effects of urbanization on biodiversity. The presence of the largest port in Latin America, the industrial pole of Cubatão, artificial structures distributed along the coast and intense tourism at certain times of the year contrasts with the low amount of information and the relationship between these factors and the biodiversity of the beaches. Therefore, this proposal intends to evaluate the effect of urbanization on the biodiversity of the sandy beaches. In order to do so, it will involve a (i) sandy beach characterization regarding morphodynamics and level of urbanization and (ii) an evaluation of the relation between urbanization and biodiversity. Finally, I propose that the results to be discussed with different actors of society to advance the discussions of the management of this environment.

It alleviates the risks imposed on workers, who typically carry out this task manually under hazardous conditions.OSIRIS combines the best features of drones and climbing robots, without their notable limitations. Drones offer flexible stand-off inspection, but their utility is limited by an inability to achieve secure contact with structures, ruling out contact-based Non-Destructive Testing (NDT) techniques capable of resolving sub-surface damage. Climbing robots offer constant contact with the target structure, but access to turbine blades requires placement and retrieval by a human, obviating the risk alleviation benefits. OSIRIS operates as both a drone and a climbing robot, with an ability to transition between the two modes, and therefore offers the benefits of each without the inherent limitations. OSIRIS can operate in close proximity to a turbine blade to obtain high definition stand-off imagery, attach and transition to climbing mode for contact based NDT, and then detach and return to drone mode.This 21-month demonstrator project brings together robotics specialist Autonomous Devices with end user Wood (a major provider of products and services to the oil and gas, power generation, clean energy, chemical, petrochemical and manufacturing sectors), materials and NDT expert The Welding Institute, and the Offshore Renewable Energy Catapult (as a demonstration partner providing access to an experimental 7MW offshore turbine at Levenmouth).

A major effect of urbanisation on biota stems from artificial structures placed in aquatic systems. While the installation of these structures has been widespread, our understanding of how they impact shoreline habitats and fauna is relatively limited. On the sandy Leirosa Beach, on the European Atlantic coast (Portugal), a decade of cumulative impacts was recorded, with disruption of the frontal dune, dune nourishment and the incorporation of geotextiles to reconstruct the dune and maintain it as an artificial structure. Two years after the dune rehabilitation process at Leirosa Beach, seasonal sampling campaigns (from spring 2010 to winter 2011) were carried out to assess the effects of the artificial dune (and the first signs of its eventual disruption) on macrofauna compared to a natural dune on the same beach. During the study period, the rehabilitated foredune maintained the average slope, with similar sediment characteristics (finer sediments) when compared with the natural dune system, with no physical significant differences being appreciated between the two sites. The macrofaunal assemblages were represented especially by crustaceans (amphipods and isopods), with similar mean total density, taxon richness and diversity between sites. Special attention was given to the supralittoral species, and the results revealed that the natural zone harboured a significantly higher density of sandhopper Talitrus saltator with respect to the artificial zone. PERMANOVA results detailed the significant difference that occurred, particularly during the warmer seasons (spring and summer 2010), the recruitment period described for this species along this coast. In fact, SIMPER analysis revealed that T. saltator accounted for 46% of the dissimilarities between the natural and artificial dune sites. The presence of geotextiles extending across the supralittoral zone appeared, on the one hand, to allow for the presence of talitrids, but the application of textiles around the area prevented them from burrowing, thus causing them to avoid the rehabilitated area. The results highlighted the potentially negative effects of this artificial dune system if textile disruption continues, and the usefulness of T. saltator as an effective and reliable ecological indicator for these ecosystems. Thus, evaluating the risks and magnitude of human interventions is a major challenge for sandy beach ecologists, and baseline information is required if we are to better understand how resident macrofaunal species deal with future impact scenarios.

Newcomers - the offshore wind farmers - are covering large areas in the German Bight which in contrast give the opportunity to use these areas in a multifunctional way by accepting mussel cultivation within the wind farms. This study compiles the basic data for offshore mussel cultivation in close vicinity to a designated offshore wind farm in the open sea of the German Bight and employs different case-scenario calculations to illustrate the impact of changing parameter values on overall profitability or non-profitability of this activity. Primary focus is placed on the production of consumer mussels but seed mussel cultivation is also taken into consideration. We show that production of consumer mussels with longline technology is sufficiently profitable even under the assumption of substantial cost increases. This is especially true, if existing capacities could be used. The cultivation of seed mussels depends on the possibility of using existing equipment. A substantial increase of seed mussel prices to at least 0.6, given the main cost categories remaining constant, turns this alternative into substantial profitability. This study concludes with providing some recommendations on how favorable terms or actions could further improve profitability of offshore mussel cultivation.

We conducted 58 otter trawls and 51 beam trawls in the spring, summer and fall of 2009-2012, and incorporated additional data from 88 otter trawls conducted by the Northeast Area Monitoring and Assessment Program. We used regionally-grouped abundance, biomass, diversity, and size spectra to assess spatial patterns in the aggregate fish community, and hierarchical cluster analysis to evaluate trends in species assemblages. Our analyses revealed coherent gradients in fish community biomass, diversity and species composition extending from inshore to offshore waters, as well as patterns related to the differing bathymetry of Rhode Island and Block Island Sounds. The fish communities around Block Island and Cox's Ledge are particularly diverse, suggesting that the proximity of hard bottom habitat may be important in structuring fish communities in this area. Species assemblages in Rhode Island and Block Island Sounds are characterized by a combination of piscivores (silver hake, summer flounder, spiny dogfish), benthivores (American lobster, black sea bass, Leucoraja spp. skates, scup) and planktivores (sea scallop), and exhibit geographic patterns that are persistent from year to year, yet variable by season. Such distributions reflect the cross-shelf migration of fish and invertebrate species in the spring and fall, highlighting the importance of considering seasonal fish behavior when planning construction schedules for offshore development projects. The fine spatial scale (10 s of kms) of this research makes it especially valuable for local marine spatial planning efforts by identifying local-scale patterns in fish community structure that will enable future assessment of the ecological impacts of offshore development. As such, this knowledge of the spatial and temporal structure of the demersal fish community in Rhode Island and Block Island Sounds will help to guide the placement of offshore structures so as to preserve the ecological and economic value of the area.

However, large cost reductions are still needed, particularly in the Operations & Maintenance (O&M) phase, which currently accounts for about 30% of the cost of offshore wind. For large component replacements, a jack-up vessel is often leased from the spot market, resulting in high costs and low utilisation. These costs can be lowered when multiple wind farm service providers would share the resources needed to employ jack-up vessels. In this paper, we analyse two types of resource sharing, as an alternative to each service provider leasing its own vessel: (i) vessel purchasing and sharing and (ii) the combined use of vessel and harbour sharing. We design a simulation model and include stochastic processes such as weather patterns and component failures. Results show that cost benefits up to 45% can be achieved compared to a leasing policy, depending on the number of wind farm service providers involved and on the geographical distance between offshore wind farms. Moreover, it is shown that the jack-up vessel should not be fully utilised to minimise costs. The performance benefits of harbour sharing in addition to vessel sharing are generally small, but become more significant if the network faces considerable congestion.

Because of its massive size the piers are built by pouring concrete at site in a floating position. During this construction period, the floating caissons are moored in place to withstand any environmental currents and waves, which may be prevalent at the site. Since the draft of the caisson changes during construction, the mooring system must be capable of holding the caisson at all these drafts. Once the construction sequence reaches the required height, the caisson is ballasted down to rest on the river bottom and subsequently during further ballasting penetrates the soil to its desired depth. The design and construction of the piers in place and their mooring system provides several technical challenges. This paper describes these challenges experienced in the design of a caisson system for a new bridge at Tacoma Narrows, close to Seattle. This design process included towing the caissons at a shallow draft from the dock to the site, design and installation of the mooring system, construction of the caissons in place, and final touchdown and penetration to soil. The current at the Narrows was extremely high, which gave particular challenges in the construction sequence. Some of the critical areas of the associated design and their solution techniques are highlighted. It should be noted that the dimensions of the bridge caissons and their mooring system are of similar order of magnitude as typical offshore structures exposed to severe environment.",,,,,,,,,8,5,0,0,0,0,12,,,0733-950X,,,,,,,,,,,"Offshore Struct Anal Inc, Plainfield, IL 60544 USAZENTECH Inc, Houston, TX 77024 USA",Offshore Struct Anal IncZENTECH Inc,,,2006-05-01,WOS:000236957000001,,,,,

The load cycles in such an environment can be in the order of a million cycles per year. Fatigue failures in these structures can take place at sites of high stress concentration that can be classified by two major categories: baseplate and weldments. The former includes locations of high stress concentration such as openings, sharp re-entry corners, and plate edges. lit general, the mechanisms behind these failures are described by the general approaches to fatigue life prediction as discussed in this paper. There are two major approaches for predicting fatigue life: (1) the S-N curve approach and (2) the fracture mechanics (FM) approach. The S-N curve approach is based oil experimental measurement of fatigue life in terms of cycles to failure for different loading levels and specimen geometries, while the fracture mechanics (FM) approach is based on the existence of an initial crack and subsequent crack propagation under cyclic load. The objective of this paper is to develop reliability-based methods for determining the fatigue life of structural details associated with conventional displacement type surface monohull ships based on the S-N approach and on the assumption that fatigue damage accumulation is a linear phenomenon (i.e., that follows Miners rule). The methods are also based on structural reliability theory and can be applied either in direct reliability-based design or in a load and resistance factor design (LRED) format. The resulting design methods are referred to as the reliability-based design approach for fatigue of marine structures. These design methods were developed according to the following requirements: (1) spectral analysis of wave induced loads, (2) use of conventional fatigue design codes, (3) nominal strength and load values, and (4) achieving target reliability levels. The first-order reliability method (FORM) was used to perform reliability assessments and to develop the partial safety factors (PSFs) for fatigue limit state equations.",,,,,,,,,34,1,0,0,0,0,41,,,0028-1425,,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Maryland, Ctr Technol & Syst Management, College Pk, MD 20742 USA",,,,2002-03-01,WOS:000179964600008,,,,,

The following hypotheses were tested: that assemblages on seawalls would differ from those on rocky shores at mid-, but not at low-shore levels; where assemblages differ between habitats, there would be differences in cover/abundances of widespread species; patterns would be consistent among locations and through time; the variability of assemblages at the scales of 10s of cm and metres would differ between seawalls and rocky shores at mid- and low-shore levels. To test these hypotheses, assemblages on seawalls and rocky shores were sampled at three locations, at roughly 4-monthly intervals, over a period of about 18 months. Results indicated that mid-shore assemblages on seawalls were different from those on rocky shores, but this was not the case at low-shore levels. Few taxa were unique to either habitat. Cover of common species of algae and sessile animals and abundances of mobile grazers were variable with few consistent patterns. Variability at the scales sampled differed between habitats and heights on the shore.

Historically, such artificial reefs formed an important component of the socio-economic development of coastal fisheries. In comparison, modern artificial reefs have taken on a variety of forms. The most widely recognized are purpose-build modular artificial reefs designed for the enhancement of fisheries yield, diving, and various other benefits. However, far more common within the Gulf are the large-scale unplanned artificial reefs that have been formed as a result of human activities in the marine system, such as large-scale coastal breakwaters, seawalls, jetties, pipelines, and oil and gas infrastructure. Although there is limited information on the role of these constructions in structuring Gulf marine communities, increasing evidence suggests that abundant and diverse communities of reef fish, coral and other benthos can develop on these structures, with important ecological implications in urbanized coastal areas in the Gulf. However, due to a variety of unintended consequences of artificial reef development such structures may also pose challenges to coastal marine management. We review the current published literature on artificial reefs in the Gulf in order to improve our understanding of the role that these structures play in Gulf coastal ecosystems, and to further develop regional management of artificial reefs. We explore the various types of artificial reef that exist in the Gulf and examine the benefits and challenges that these structures represent for coastal ecology and economics. Such information is essential for our improved understanding and management of these increasingly important ecosystems in the Gulf. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

To this end, the conventional (Monte Carlo) time simulation technique (CTS) is frequently used for predicting the probability distribution of the extreme values of response. However, this technique suffers from excessive sampling variability and hence a large number of simulated extreme responses (hundreds of simulated response records) are required to reduce the sampling variability to acceptable levels. A more efficient version of the time simulation technique (ETS) was recently introduced which takes advantage of the correlation between the extreme surface elevations and their corresponding extreme responses by dividing the simulated extreme responses into a number of groups based on the magnitude of their associated extreme surface elevations. The probability distribution of response extreme values for each group is then calculated individually based on a relatively small number of simulations, and then the total probability theorem is used to derive the probability distribution of response extreme values. The ETS procedure is found to be many times more efficient than the CTS method. However, its efficiency and accuracy reduces for sea states of lower intensity. In this paper, a more efficient version of the ETS technique is introduced which takes advantage of the correlation between extreme values of the nonlinear response and their corresponding linear response extreme values (both quasi-static and dynamic linear responses are considered)). The three different versions of the ETS technique are compared by exposing a test structure to sea states of different intensity.

Mobility of human activities across borders and ecological conditions in the Bay of Biscay make it essential to enhance cross-border regulations, strategies and cooperation to ensure coherence across biogeographical boundaries and to use common knowledge. This research aims to identify the key issues and challenges in order to raise recommendations for a transboundary EB-MSP in the Bay of Biscay, for achieving socio-economic and environmental objectives based on a holistic vision of economic, environmental and social settings, and present management practices. In order to reach this objective; settings of the area with economic, environmental and social dynamics were drawn, existing MSFD program of measures and conservation practices, as well as measurable objectives were analysed, and critical issues with recommendations for planning and implementation phases were emphasised. The results indicate that program of measures of France and Spain focused on the similar concerns, however both countries followed different methods. Accordingly, recommendations could be drawn on key six topics such as space conflict, offshore structures, joint risk assessment, marine litter, measures and objectives and cross-border governance. Hence, this research concludes that there are different objectives for the same marine regions from two countries, and it is significant to integrate process leaders, working groups and responsible regional authorities to achieve coherent and efficient transboundary EB-MSP.",,,,,,,,,9,0,0,0,3,0,9,,,0308-597X,1872-9460,,,,,,,,,,"AZTI, Marine Res Div, Pasaia 20110, SpainOff Francais Biodiversite, 16 Quai Douane, F-29229 Brest, France",,,,2020-09-22,WOS:000567444700001,,,,,

The higher CPUE (catch per unit effort) of C. antennarius beneath the platform, compared with nearby soft bottom stations, suggested that this species remained primarily in the vicinity of the platform. Although C. anthonyi did not recruit at the platform, adult female C. anthonyi were attracted to the platform from surrounding habitat. The higher CPUE of female C. anthonyi beneath the platform, compared with soft bottom stations, suggested that habitat selection is related to reproduction in this species.

One growing application is bird distributions and abundances in relation to EIAs for marine installations such as offshore wind farms and sea crossing transportation infrastructure. The ornithological surveys in relation to the EIA process concerning the Burbo Bank Extension and Walney Extension offshore wind farms that are being undertaken jointly by Aarhus University and BLOM-UK are an example of the former, with monthly surveys of two offshore areas (total area ca. 670 km(2)) in the Irish Sea.

Marine renewable energy, offshore wind energy especially, contributes to the renewable energy mix. Offshore wind farms appear to be clean, and are supported by governments and NGOs as a way to reduce the use of conventional energy resources and thus decrease greenhouse gas emissions. However, developing infrastructure in marine areas can impact marine ecosystems. European directives ask offshore wind farm developers to carry out an Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) including a mitigation hierarchy, i.e. envisaging measures that would avoid, reduce, and if possible offset significant adverse effects on ecosystems and human activities. This paper reviews EIA reports from seven European countries and is focused on impacts on the open water marine environment. According to the reports, measures have been taken for avoiding and reducing impacts, so there should be no significant negative residual impacts and hence no need of offsets. But the mitigation hierarchy for ecological impacts seems to have been incompletely implemented, because it is unlikely that there are no significant residual impacts. The paper proposes some technical and ecological explanations, followed by some governance and social explanations, for the absence of biodiversity offsets. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Despite little resolution over this issue, artificial reefs are often considered for use as compensatory mitigation for damaged marine resources. We estimate the quantitative enhancement of fish production under 4 plausible scenarios: attraction, enhancement, enhancement with fishing, and attraction with fishing. Our intent is not to resolve the attraction-enhancement debate, but to quantify the uncertainty associated with using artificial reefs as compensatory mitigation. Pertinent parameters for production calculations (fish density by size class, length-frequency distributions, diets, behaviors, age-specific growth and mortality rates) were obtained from syntheses of findings from artificial reef studies conducted in coastal waters of the southeastern USA and from species life-history profiles. Year-round reef inhabitants were separated into 2 groups: those whose recruitment appears to be limited by available reef habitat (only 2 taxa) and those not augmented in recruitment but potentially enhanced in realized production by provision of refuges and reef-associated prey (15 taxa). Estimates of enhanced production in this latter group were discounted by an index of reef exclusivity in diet to give production credit in proportion to consumption of reef-associated prey. Estimates of annual production enhancement per 10 m(2) of artificial reef ranged from 0 kg under the attraction scenario to 6.45 kg wet weight under the assumption of enhancement plus protection from fishing. Application of fishing reduced the enhancement estimate by 32 % to 4.44 kg 10 m(-2) yr(-1). A 4th scenario of attraction with fishing may yield a net decline in production of a similar magnitude. In contrast to many natural structural habitats (seagrass meadows, oyster reefs, salt marshes, mangroves) that have dramatically decreased over past decades and are clearly important nursery grounds, evidence is weak that habitat provided by artificial reefs on the shallow continental shelf of the southeastern USA is currently limiting to fish production. Until convincing empirical evidence appears, high scientific uncertainty limits confidence in using artificial reefs as compensatory mitigation. Furthermore, even if augmented production were achieved, managing fishing impacts would be critical to achieving the expected production benefit.",,,,,,,,,115,5,0,0,101,2,150,,,0171-8630,1616-1599,,,,,,,,,,"Univ S Alabama, Dept Marine Sci, Dauphin Isl, AL 36528 USADauphin Isl Sea Lab, Dauphin Isl, AL 36528 USAUniv N Carolina, Inst Marine Sci, Morehead City, NC 28557 USAUniv Florida, Dept Fisheries & Aquat Sci, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA",,,,2003-01-01,WOS:000188586200022,,,,,

Energy production at onshore, near shore and offshore locations was 340 TWh, which is about 2% of worldwide electricity usage, and has doubled in the past three years and will continue to grow substantially. This g,rowth comprises not only more wind farms, but wind mills with more capacity as well [1-3].To achieve this growth, (heavy) lift companies and offshore contractors meet various challenges. Since primary cost for producing wind energy is construction, with up to 10 lifts per vvind mill, a very competitive environment has been created in which efficient logistic and lifting operations, flexibility, avoiding damage to loads and safety are paramount [4,5]. Appropriate lifting gear provides an essential tool to meet these challenges; especially at offshore locations.Currently, steel wire ropes and grommets are extensively being used as lifting gear during the construction of wind farms, with its low cost being the key driver. But its weight together with the risk for damage to loads and injuries to operators are serious concerns. Synthetic slings, especially those made from polyester fiber, have gained popularity as a way to overcome these concerns.But, such slings are very sensitive to damage, hence its value and risk-avoidance is more and more being questioned; especially considering currently applicable legislation such as the European Machinery Directive 2006/42/EC [6].With the introduction of high performance fibers, such as Dyneema (R) (Ultra-High Molecular Polyethylene (UHMwPE) fiber), not just another synthetic fiber has been introduced. The use of this UHMwPE fiber in protective sleeves and load bearing constructions holds the characteristics to overcome the concerns of the traditional materials as it has been proven by well-respected lifting companies.Since durability of a synthetic sling is largely determined by the perforniance of the protective sleeves, this paper comprehensively presents the abrasion, cut and tear resistance improvement created by sleeves made with fibers such as Dyneema (R). In combination with its ftinctionality in load bearing constructions and the key elements of the European Machinery Directive 2006/42/EC, this paper proves that Ultralift (R) rouridslings made with Dyneema (R) provide not only safer and easier but also more cost effective construction (logistics and lifting) operations.So, slings made with Dyneema (R) have been entrusted to meet the lifting challenges of today and tomorrow.",,,,,"30th International Conference on Ocean, Offshore and Arctic Engineering30th International Conference on Ocean, Offshore and Arctic Engineering","JUN 19-24, 2011JUN 19-24, 2011","ASME, Ocean Offshore & Arctic Engn DivASME, Ocean Offshore & Arctic Engn Div","Rotterdam, NETHERLANDSRotterdam, NETHERLANDS",2,0,0,0,0,0,2,,,,,978-0-7918-4437-3,,,,,,,,,"DSM Dyneema BV, Urmond, Netherlands",,,,2011-01-01,WOS:000314736400081,,,,,

For such reasons, intermediate-scale field modelling of offshore floating structures may become an interesting as well as cost-effective alternative in a near future. Clearly, since the open sea is not a controlled environment, traditional system identification may become challenging and less precise.

This alters the abundance and distribution of the affected species and also their feeding behaviour and diet. Despite this, the effects of coastal aquaculture on zooplankton assemblages and the potential changes in their abundance and distribution remain largely unstudied. Traditional plankton sampling hauls between the farm mooring systems entail some practical difficulties. As an alternative, light traps were deployed at 2 farms in the SW Mediterranean during a whole warm season. Total zooplankton capture by traps at farms was higher than at control locations on every sampling night. It ranged from 3 to 10 times higher for the taxonomic groups: bivalvia, cladocera, cumacea, fish early-life-stages, gastropoda, polychaeta and tanaidacea; 10-20 times higher for amphipoda, chaetognatha, isopoda, mysidacea and ostracoda, and 22 times higher for copepoda and the crustacean juvenile stages zoea and megalopa. Permutational analysis showed significant differences for the most abundant zooplankton groups (copepoda, crustacean larvae, chaetognatha, cladocera, mysidacea and polychaeta). This marked incremental increase in zooplankton taxa at farms was consistent, irrespective of the changing environmental variables registered every night. Reasons for the greater abundance of zooplankton at farms are discussed, although results suggest a retention effect caused by cage structures rather than active attraction through physical or chemical cues.

Conservation actions typically encompass spatial and temporal threat reductions and protection of eggs and broods. Still, populations decline or recover only slowly, calling for fresh approaches in beach-bird conservation.Because energetic demands are critically high during the nesting and chick rearing phases, and chick survival is particularly low, supplementing prey to breeding birds and their offspring is theoretically attractive as a means to complement more traditional conservation measures.Prey for plovers and similar species on ocean beaches consists of invertebrates (e.g. small crustaceans, insects) many of which feed on stranded masses of plant material (e.g. kelp and seagrass) and use this 'wrack' as habitat. We added wrack to the upper beach where plovers nest and their chicks forage to test whether algal subsidies promote the abundance and diversity of their invertebrate prey.Adding wrack to the upper beach significantly increased the abundance and diversity of invertebrate prey items. At wrack subsidies greater than 50% of surface cover invertebrate assemblages became highly distinct compared with those that received smaller additions of wrack. Substantial (2-4 fold) increases in the abundance amphipods and isopods that are principal prey items for plovers drove these shifts.This proof-of-concept study demonstrates the feasibility of food provisioning for birds on ocean shores. Whilst novel, it is practicable, inexpensive and does not introduce further restrictions or man-made structures. Thus, it can meaningfully add to the broader arsenal of conservation tools for threatened species that are wholly reliant on sandy beaches as breeding and foraging habitats. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

A range of variables were considered, which include both artificial structures/alterations and natural features observed in a stream reach. Multivariate regression trees (MRT) were used to assess the effects of the explanatory variables on invertebrate assemblages and five groups, characterized by different habitat modification and/or features, were recognized. Four node variables determined the splits in the MRT analysis: channel reinforcement, tree-related bank and channel habitats, channel modification and bank modification. Continuity of trees in the river corridor diverged among MRT groups and significant differences among groups include presence of alders, extent of channel shading and substrate diversity. Also, the percentage of in-stream organic substrates, in particular CPOM/Xylal, showed highly significant differences among groups. For practical applications, thresholds for the extent of channel reinforcement (40%) and modification (10%) and for bank alteration (approximate to 30%) were provided, that can be used to guide the implementation of restoration measures. In moderately altered river reaches, a significant extent of tree-related habitats (approximate to 5%) can noticeably mitigate the effects of morphological alteration on aquatic invertebrates. The outcomes highlight the importance of riparian zone management as an opportune, achievable prospect in the restoration of Mediterranean temporary streams. The impact of bank and channel modification on ecological status (sensu WFD) was investigated and the tested benthic metrics, especially those based on abundance data, showed legible differences among MRT groups. Finally, bank and channel modification appears to be a potential threat for the conservation of a few Sardo-Corsican endemic species. The introduction of management criteria that openly use information on endemic species seems crucial to reduce the risk of improving overall ecological status while depleting biodiversity.

Urbanization is spreading uneven on land with a rapid occupation of the coast line, which currently poses a major threat to marine biodiversity and ecosystem functioning. The main problems associated with urban sprawl in the marine environment are the increased pollution and the replacement of natural shores by artificial structures. Physical changes have been associated with global declines in species richness and biological invasions, and alterations in ecological processes. However, there is still little information on the effects of urbanization on the many ecological functions that benthic assemblages exert in marine ecosystems. For instance, macroalgal assemblages, such as kelps, are posited to play an important role in carbon cycling in benthic systems, although this has not been fully investigated. Thus, the main objective of this Research Internship Abroad Scholarship is to assess how urbanization affects the role of kelps on costal systems regarding their contribution to 'blue carbon', productivity and connectivity among habitats. This will be done in collaboration with the Applied Marine and Estuarine Ecology (AMEE) Lab at the University of New South Wales, which has been leading worldwide research on human impacts on marine ecosystems.

To ameliorate the deficiencies of structural design, as well as to reduce the costs of such Arctic offshore field developments, ice management operations may be considered to reduce the ice severity. Ice management in sea ice will typically involve use of 1 to 4 icebreakers depending on the operating environment. The ice management fleet is aimed at protecting the offshore installation by breaking the incoming ice into smaller pieces and by reducing the confinement in the ice cover. Failure of such a marine operation in the demanding Arctic environment can threaten the integrity of the offshore platforms or drilling units, e.g. by increasing the chances of failure of mooring lines in the occurrence of extreme events. Therefore, understanding the causes of such potential failure, as well as the factors influencing it is of crucial importance in order to plan for and mitigate the risks. Factors with an influence on the risk are called risk influencing factors (RIFs) and can be technical, organizational and human. RIFs are identified and structured in this study in a way that they affect the basic events of a conventional fault tree analysis and consequently the total risk. In this study, the RIF's are treated as uncertain variables. The established model is called a hybrid model because it is a merger of a Bayesian belief network (BBN) for the RIP structure and a conventional fault tree model. The Bayesian framework provides the opportunity for updating of the model constituents as more evidence becomes available over time. Case studies are defined to illustrate the methodology. Results show how the improvement in the status of the RIFs (better practices) can improve the reliability of the mooring lines of a floating unit and how the precision in data and other model parameters affect the results. At the end, an investment priority measure is proposed that can help in determining where among the various influencing factors the available limited resources should be spent in a way that it results in maximum gain in ultimate reliability.",,,,,"33rd ASME International Conference on Ocean, Offshore and Arctic Engineering33rd ASME International Conference on Ocean, Offshore and Arctic Engineering","JUN 08-13, 2014JUN 08-13, 2014","ASME, Ocean, Offshore & Arct Engn DivASME, Ocean, Offshore & Arct Engn Div","San Francisco, CASan Francisco, CA",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,978-0-7918-4556-1,,,,,,,,,"Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol, SAMCoT, Ctr Res Based Innovat, N-7034 Trondheim, NorwayStatoil Technol Excellence Arctic Technol, Fornebu, Norway",,,,2015-11-18,WOS:000363499200035,,,,,

Two different pushover analysis methods are used to find the ultimate strength, which give quite different reserve strength ratio (RSR) results for certain structures. The effect on the structural reliability of varying topside weight is also assessed. It is found that the reliability trends are strongly dependent on structural topology - an effect that is not included in current Codes of practice. It is also shown that a single set of partial load factors for dead and environmental loads cannot achieve uniform reliability across different platform configurations in the same environment. Furthermore, in some cases, a working stress design format gives more consistent reliability results than the load and resistance design factor approach.

As a theoretical discussion, the intensity and scale of combined three-tube artificial reef with different layouts at five Reynolds numbers (Re) were numerically investigated using the RNG k-[epsilon] turbulent model and SIMPLEC algorithm in this study. The three dimensional flow field around three-tube artificial reefs was analyzed by using the continuity and Reynolds averaged (RANS) equations, generating tetrahedral unstructured mesh elements in GAMBIT. The bottom surface and the side surface used boundary conditions with no-slipping wall, the viscous model used k-e turbulence model, and the pressure-velocity coupling used SIMPLEC algorithm. Utilizing FLUENT6. 3. 26 to simulate the flow field around five different artificial reef models including single reef and two reefs combined in different disposal spaces. Particle image velocimetry (PIV) technique was also used to analyze the flow flied distribution by comparing the indexes of flow field obtained in experiment and numerical simulation. Results showed that, in the environment of FLUENT software, upwelling size and strength increased with the increase of Reynolds number, but the trend of back eddy was not obvious. In a parallel combination, a better flow field effect of artificial reef was obtained when the disposal space between two parallel reefs was 1 times wide of reef size. While in a vertical combination, a better performance occurred when the disposal space between two vertical reefs was 1. 5[approximately]2. 0 times of the reef size. At different current velocities and under different wave conditions, both the slip-resistance coefficient and rolling-resistance coefficient of the three-tube artificial reef were greater than 1, which proved that the three-tube artificial reef had good physical stability. The research can provide theoretical reference for the construction of artificial reefs.",,,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,,,1672-5174,,,,,,,,,,,"Shanghai Ocean Univ, Coll Marine Sci, Shanghai, 201306, China",,,,2017-03-30,ZOOREC:ZOOR15304024399,,,,,

The use of these materials is being investigated in many infrastructure applications such as offshore structures in general and reinforced-concrete bridge decks in marine environments or cold climates. Both of these applications can benefit from these lightweight, high strength materials. In addition, both applications require exposure to severe conditions that involve salt-containing environments.In 1997, a laboratory research program was initiated to complement a field investigation in which composite materials were being used to wrap 12 corrosion-damaged bridges in Texas. The program was sponsored by the Texas Department of Transportation and included more than 60 laboratory specimens that were designed to simulate bridge bents and columns. The overall objective was to determine whether composite wrapping could be used as a means of rehabilitating corrosion-damaged structures. Over the years, the laboratory specimens have been subjected to intermittent exposure to saltwater conditions. They have been monitored using corrosion (half-cell) potential measurements that indicate the probability of corrosion activity. Corrosion rate measurements have also been determined on selected specimens. Periodically, specimens have been removed from testing and subjected to thorough post-exposure examination and autopsy. In most of the autopsies, the focus was on the difference in the behavior of the wrapped and unwrapped specimens. However, during the most recent autopsy, the focus was expanded to include the behavior of the different composite materials used to wrap the specimens. The composite systems used included a vinyl ester resin and two epoxy resins in combination with a selected fabric containing glass fibers. The overall performance of the wrapped and unwrapped specimens after more than four years of saltwater exposure will be presented. In addition, the performance of the individual composite systems will be discussed based on the results of the Texas investigation and other investigations that have been conducted within the last few years.",,,,,14th International Offshore and Polar Engineering Conference (ISOPE 2004)14th International Offshore and Polar Engineering Conference (ISOPE 2004),"MAY 23-28, 2004MAY 23-28, 2004",Int Soc Offshore & Polar EngineersInt Soc Offshore & Polar Engineers,"Toulon, FRANCEToulon, FRANCE",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,1098-6189,,1-880653-62-1,,,,,,,,,"Univ Texas, Civil Engn Dept, Austin, TX USA",,,,2004-01-01,WOS:000223784300042,,,,,

The time history of ocean wave conditions are concluded as follows.(1) In relatively lower wave height conditions - calm sea condition - (lower than twice the height of the mean wave in the area), encountered wave height can be seen as a time independent random process.(2) In higher wave conditions - storm condition - (higher than twice the height of the mean wave in area), wave height increases over time and reaches a maximum value at one point only before decreasing gradually. That is, encountered wave height is a time dependent prosess.(3) Conditions (1) and (2) appear alternately in random order.Above characteristics of time history of encountered wave conditions in any area is the same, but mean wave height, mean storm duration, maximum wave height in the storm condition and the number of storms encountered in service life depend on the sailing route and the sea area. A standard loading model - storm model - applied to fatigue strength analysis has been determined by the collected data.The fatigue limits for crack initiation and crack propagation under storm model conditions are proved to be higher than that of a constant amplitude test which is stress amplitude according to fatigue life of 2 millions cycles and also to be higher than one-third of maximum stress in storm conditions. The storm conditions, therefore, only damage structural members.Based on above storm model, new fatigue design method to be applicable to ship and offshore stru ctures is proposed.Fatigue test under storm model were performed for specimens with boxing fillet weldments which one of the most important ship structural components from a view point of fatigue strength.

However, even with currently available SAR image resolutions of 3 m and higher, signal returns from man-made structures hamper the accurate mapping of flooded areas. Enhanced image processing algorithms and a better exploitation of image archives are required to facilitate the use of microwave remote-sensing data for monitoring flood dynamics in urban areas. In this paper, a hybrid methodology combining backscatter thresholding, region growing, and change detection (CD) is introduced as an approach enabling the automated, objective, and reliable flood extent extraction from very high resolution urban SAR images. The method is based on the calibration of a statistical distribution of open water backscatter values from images of floods. Images acquired during dry conditions enable the identification of areas that are not visible to the sensor (i.e., regions affected by shadow) and that systematically behave as specular reflectors (e. g., smooth tarmac, permanent water bodies). CD with respect to a reference image thereby reduces overdetection of inundated areas. A case study of the July 2007 Severn River flood (UK) observed by airborne photography and the very high resolution SAR sensor on board TerraSAR-X highlights advantages and limitations of the method. Even though the proposed fully automated SAR-based flood-mapping technique overcomes some limitations of previous methods, further technological and methodological improvements are necessary for SAR-based flood detection in urban areas to match the mapping capability of high-quality aerial photography.",,,,,,,,,279,8,0,0,26,0,294,,,0196-2892,1558-0644,,,,,,,,,,"Ctr Rech Publ Gabriel Lippmann, Dept Environm Agrobiotechnol, L-4422 Belvaux, LuxembourgUniv Bristol, Sch Geog Sci, Bristol BS8 1SS, Avon, EnglandUniv Reading, Environm Syst Sci Ctr, Reading RG6 6AL, Berks, England",,,,2013-04-01,WOS:000318427500022,,,,,

The presence of the sea squirt Didemnum perlucidum (Monniot, 1983) was first documented in Australia in 2010 and has since then been detected extensively throughout the state of Western Australia and in the Northern Territory. These detections have raised important questions as to the origin and potential impact of this species in Australia. The current study was initiated to review the current known global geographic range of D. perlucidum and to obtain specimens that could support molecular studies aimed at evaluating the potential origin of this species in Australia. Characterization of 5' COI mitochondrial sequences from 286 specimens revealed a remarkably low level of genetic diversity across the current known range of D. perlucidum and the existence of one main widespread genetic haplotype. Such findings suggest that all locations sampled in this study may in fact represent introductions of D. perlucidum and that the natural native range of the species remains unknown. Our demonstration that specimens (n=187) originating from across a broad expanse of the Australian West Coast were comprised of a single haplotype also lends support to the hypothesis that D. perlucidum is a species that has been introduced recently into Australia. This hypothesis is supported by the fact that D. perlucium distribution in Australia is mostly confined to artificial structures, it has displayed invasive characteristics, and its presence is now being detected across an increasingly wide geographical area. Given the demonstrated low level of genetic COI variation across its known global distribution, lack of clarity around its native range, and limited availability of data on this species globally, we recognize the requirement for further work to more fully elucidate the exact origins and patterns of distribution of D. perlucidum in Australia. This study represents the most comprehensive mapping of the current global distribution of D. perlucidum conducted to date and will hopefully motivate further studies aimed at elucidating this species biology, origin, high-risk routes and impacts.",,,,,,,,,22,0,0,0,22,1,24,,,1798-6540,1818-5487,,,,,,,,,,"Govt Western Australia, Dept Fisheries, POB 20, North Beach, WA 6920, AustraliaUniv Western Australia, Sch Anim Biol, 35 Stirling Highway, Crawley, WA 6009, AustraliaUniv Fed Parana, Dept Zool, CP 19020, BR-81531980 Curitiba, Parana, BrazilNOAA, Natl Marine Sanctuaries, 1845 Wasp Blvd,Bldg 176, Honolulu, HI 96818 USAUniv Autonoma Nuevo Leon, Fac Ciencias Biol, Lab Biosistemat, San Nicolas De Los Garza, Nuevo Leon, MexicoInst Latinoamer Ciencias Marinas & Ambiente, Miami, FL USAChevron Australia Pty Ltd, Dynons Plaza 905 Hay St, Perth, WA 6000, AustraliaMurdoch Univ, Sch Vet & Life Sci, South St, Murdoch, WA 6150, Australia",Inst Latinoamer Ciencias Marinas & Ambiente,,,2016-11-09,WOS:000385924700002,,,,,

The scarcity of empirical data regarding fish species that may utilize development sites, further compounded by the novelty of the technology and inherent difficulty of conducting offshore research, make identification and assessment of potential stressors to species of concern problematic. However, there is broad potential to mitigate putatively negative impacts to seasonal migrants during the exploration and construction phases. The goal of this study was to establish baseline information on endangered Atlantic Sturgeon in the NewYorkWind Energy Area (NYWEA), a future offshore development site. Passive acoustic transceivers equipped with acoustic release mechanisms were used to monitor the movements of tagged fish in the NYWEA from November 2016 through February 2018 and resulted in detections of 181 unique individuals throughout the site. Detections were highly seasonal and peaked from November through January. Conversely, fish were relatively uncommon or entirely absent during the summer months (July-September). Generalized additive models indicated that predictable transitions between coastal and offshore habitat were associated with long-term environmental cues and localized estuarine conditions, specifically the interaction between photoperiod and river temperature. These insights into the ecology of marine-resident Atlantic Sturgeon are crucial for both defining monitoring parameters and guiding threat assessments in offshore waters and represent an important initial step towards quantitatively evaluating Atlantic Sturgeon at a scale relevant to future development.",,,,,,,,,8,0,0,0,6,0,9,,,2045-2322,,,,,,,,,,,"SUNY Stony Brook, Sch Marine & Atmospher Sci, Stony Brook, NY 11794 USAMonmouth Univ, Dept Biol, West Long Branch, NJ 07764 USA",,,,2019-08-27,WOS:000482709400043,31455878,,,,

Recent (2018) surface elevation measurements at lower intertidal salt marsh sites were compared with those from 2009-2011. The long-term (1960-2017) relative sea-level rise (RSLR) was estimated as 2.19 mm y-1 and only two of the seven sites assessed are keeping pace with this RSLR. The SLAMM, which was applied to a focus area near Thesen's Island, predicted up to 40% loss of upper intertidal salt marsh by 2100, because development in the adjacent area prevents habitat migration. Currently, salt marsh habitats cover a total of 667 ha, and artificial structures are present along 20.7 km of the perimeter. Protecting areas for salt marsh migration should be a conservation priority, because this estuary supports the third largest area of intertidal salt marsh in the country.

An accurate estimation of offshore structural performance with time-varying effect is a keen technical issue. The traditional Markov chain model used for structural strength predictions suffers from the difficulty that some of the measurements or inspection data are largely different from the predicted damage condition. This paper presents a deterioration prediction method for maintenance planning in offshore engineering using the Markov models. Instead of traditional deterministic approaches, the Markov chain model is refined by expressing the transition probabilities as random variables. Through such development, the proposed model is able to estimate an interval for the deterioration of an offshore structure. An existing offshore structure located in South China Sea is used in this study for the demonstration purpose. The selection of transition periods of the Markov chain model is investigated. The use of the stochastic model in the prediction of maintenance timing is also discussed.

Here, we show that while temperate fishes were more abundant on natural reefs, tropical, and subtropical fishes exhibited higher abundances and biomasses on deep (25-35m) artificial reefs. Further analyses reveal that this effect depended on feeding guilds because planktivorous and piscivorous but not herbivorous fishes were more abundant on artificial reefs.

Today, less than 10 years after this research, their position and application are significant in the offshore oil industry world-wide. Their preference in major offshore development areas like Brazil, West Africa, North Sea, Norwegian Sea, West of Shetland and the Gulf of Mexico where reliable high capacity foundations for catenary and taut legged moorings are required is well known. Key factors which have influenced their selection as a preferred foundation include:Reliable design methods both for installation and in service behaviourPredictable installation behaviourRedundancy, i.e. installation may be reversed and repeatedCost efficiencyRemoval is easy if planned for Suction pile technology has been applied for a great variety of fixed and floating offshore structures and proved to be extremely adaptable to soil conditions, structural requirements and type and magnitude of loading. The suction pile used in mooring application is a flexible foundation solution: Geometry and aspect ratio (length to diameter ratio) can vary significantly. Installation methods likewise can vary similarly and the anchors may be fabricated at a great variety of construction yards. Design methods used to date are based on general soil mechanics and soil modelling. General rules and regulations are not specifically reflecting this new foundation technique although some codes (e.g. NS 3481) have made certification or authority approval easier and as such, contributed to the rapid growth of this foundation solution.

A broad range of ecological effects are associated with ALAN, but the changes to ecological processes remain largely unstudied. Predation is a key ecological process that structures assemblages and responds to natural cycles of light and dark. We investigated the effect of ALAN on fish predatory behaviour, and sessile invertebrate prey assemblages. Over 21 days fish and sessile assemblages were exposed to 3 light treatments (Day, Night and ALAN). An array of LED spotlights was installed under a wharf to create the ALAN treatments. We used GoPro cameras to film during the day and ALAN treatments, and a Dual frequency IDentification SONar (DIDSON) to film during the night treatments. Fish were most abundant during unlit nights, but were also relatively. sedentary. Predatory behaviour was greatest during the day and under ALAN than at night, suggesting that fish are using structures for non-feeding purposes (e.g. shelter) at night, but artificial light dramatically increases their predatory behaviour. Altered predator behaviour corresponded with structural changes to sessile prey assemblages among the experimental lighting treatments. We demonstrate the direct effects of artificial lighting on fish behaviour and the concomitant indirect effects on sessile assemblage structure. Current and future projected use of artificial lights has the potential to significantly affect predator-prey interactions in marine systems by altering habitat use for both predators and prey. However, developments in lighting technology are a promising avenue for mitigation. This is among the first empirical evidence from the marine system on how ALAN can directly alter predation, a fundamental ecosystem process, and have indirect trophic consequences.

Four studies estimated the magnitude and frequency of exploitation by people, and established how human exploitation varied in space and time. A manipulative experiment involving the removal of mussels, mimicking the impact of human harvesting, was carried out to identify the effects of extensive mussel exploitation. Recreational exploitation was a major recurrent disturbance. Hundreds of people visited defence structures for recreational fishing and to harvest a variety of invertebrates to be used primarily as food. Human exploitation was most intense during the spring and summer but relatively unpredictable at scales of days and hours. Exploitation was homogeneous among different locations, despite marked differences in the accessibility of the structures. Visitors to the structures were mainly local people. Harvesting of mussels was particularly disruptive for the assemblages, leading to depletion of mussel beds, opening of unoccupied space, patchiness in the assemblages, and favouring the development of macroalgae. The main types of macroalgae were green and filamentous algae, which are a nuisance for beach tourism in the area, and the invasive species Codium fragile ssp. tomentosoides.

The ocean environment, especially the sea bottom, can only be characterized with limited accuracy in terms of input parameters for the numerical model at hand. Therefore the effect of these parameter uncertainties on the prediction of sound pressure levels (SPLs) in the water column is investigated by a probabilistic approach. In fact, a variation of the bottom material parameters by means of Monte-Carlo simulations shows significant effects on the predicted SPLs. A sensitivity analysis of the model with respect to the single quantities is performed, as well as a global variation. Based on the latter, the probability distribution of the SPLs at an exemplary receiver position is evaluated and compared to measurements. The aim of this procedure is to develop a model to reliably predict an interval for the SPLs, by quantifying the degree of uncertainty of the SPLs with the MC simulations.

J,,,,,,,,,"Andresen, Jeffrey",,Doctoral Dissertation Research: A Regional Climate Model - Geographic Information System Approach To Wind Power Climatology,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Awarded Grant,Apr 01 2003,2003,"Advances in wind turbine technology and reassessments of wind power potential have resulted in a rapid buildup of wind energy capacity in the United States and worldwide. Already several nations have mandated that a substantial portion of their electricity needs be generated by wind turbines. Numerous wind farm projects are under development in regions where the wind power resource has traditionally been considered too low for economical extraction. Wind energy is now, in many areas, less costly than conventional energy production methods. In choosing wind farm sites, planners rely on a regional wind climatology (averages and standard deviations) derived from the statistical interpolation of surface wind speed observations that are not at the height of the turbine, are sparsely distributed, and may be of questionable quality. Such interpolations may contain a great deal of error when no nearby observations exist, especially over water or complex terrain (often some of the windiest regions). As a result, wind farm siting methodologies are largely post hoc and the best sites climatologically may be overlooked. An alternative to traditional statistical methods is the use of a regional numerical climate model (RCM) to provide estimates of wind speeds at a fine temporal (hourly) and spatial (< 12 km) scale, and do so at the height of the wind turbine, rather than the surface. Thus, the primary goal of this dissertation research is to develop a regional climate model (RCM) based geographic information system (GIS) for the purposes of wind farm siting. The key question this research will address is whether the RCM/GIS approach represents a significant improvement over currently employed statistical techniques (e.g., spatial interpolation, measure-correlate-predict [MCP], probability density functions [pdf]). The research will make use of the wind speed output of the MM5 RCM operated by the U.S. Forest Service for fire weather analysis over the Great Lakes region of North America. The model output will be validated against wind speed observation records at several surface stations throughout the region. It is expected that the RCM will provide a significant improvement over traditional statistical methods in the fine-resolution estimation of the regional wind resource. Upon validation, the output of the RCM will be included in a GIS and coupled with additional wind farm siting criteria to create a siting tool that will identify the optimal wind farm sites in a region based upon the considerations determined by a wind farm developer. After the initial model development and validation, this grant facilitates the evaluation of the RCM/GIS model over a different region (the UK) where wind energy development also is growing rapidly and a great deal of wind climate research already has been conducted. This evaluation, to take place at the University of East Anglia will also provide an opportunity for leading European wind energy researchers to provide input on the suitability of such a model to varied and diverse regions. This research endeavors to provide a new method for the optimal siting of wind farms such that they can operate most economically and with a minimum of disruption to society and the environment. It also represents a new and practical use for a RCM outside the realm of atmospheric science. Such research would highlight the strengths and limitations of utilizing regional climate models in practical applications. Additionally, through the use of a regional climate model the wind resource of regions where surface wind observations are sparse or lacking may be effectively estimated. Such ability would facilitate the development of wind energy projects in offshore locations as well as in less developed countries that would greatly benefit from the development of an independent energy infrastructure. Furthermore, as a Doctoral Dissertation Research Improvement award, this award also will provide support to enable a promising student to establish a strong independent research career.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,302469,,,,,,,,Michigan State University,,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:13910819,,,,,

Although the strength levels of HSS make structural weight reduction possible, and corresponding reduction of transportation and other manufacturing costs, the usability of high strength steels is negatively affected by issues such as a susceptibility to cracking and heat affected zone (HAZ) softening due to the effects of welding heat input. These quality problems can have a detrimental effect on the structural integrity of HSS welded structures. This paper critically reviews the usability of high strength steels from a structural integrity viewpoint drawing attention to the key issues involved. A decision-making tool for risk assessment based on the analytical hierarchy process (AHP) is presented and its suitability for evaluation of structural integrity risk in welded HSS structures. Challenges regarding HSS usability from the weldability and service performance perspectives are related to factors such as heat input, cooling rate and type of filler material; and weld geometry and crack propagation, respectively. The potential of an on-line welding process monitoring system incorporating AHP as part of the risk assessment process is noted. Additionally, the study identifies a need for further research on neuro-fuzzy network systems as an optimization mechanism for mitigating potential flaws in welding usability of HSS and its variants (advanced high strength steels, and ultra-high strength steels).",,,,,,,,,4,0,0,0,0,0,4,,,1606-5131,,,,,,,,,,,"Lappeenranta Univ Technol, Dept Mech Engn, Lab Welding Technol, POB 20, Lappeenranta 53851, Finland",,,,2017-03-01,WOS:000393215300004,,,,,

Future research should focus on the potential role of habitat complexity, substrate orientation and type, and inter-specific relations in explaining the different communities on offshore platforms.",,,,,,,,,11,0,0,0,6,0,11,,,1385-1101,1873-1414,,,,,,,,,,"Bur Waardenburg, POB 365, NL-4100 AJ Culemborg, NetherlandsWageningen Marine Res, POB 57, NL-1780 AB Den Helder, NetherlandsWageningen Univ, Aquat Ecol & Water Qual Management Grp, Droevendaalsesteeg 3a, NL-6708 PD Wageningen, Netherlands",Bur Waardenburg,,,2019-10-22,WOS:000489353200003,,,,,

This is particular critical as high strength steels are being used increasingly in ship and offshore structures. In this paper, a simulation program (FCG-System) is developed utilizing the commercial software ABAQUS with its object-oriented programming interface to simulate the fatigue crack path and to compute the corresponding fatigue life. In order to apply FCG-System in large-scale marine structures, the substructure modeling technique is integrated in the system under the consideration of structural details and load shedding during crack growth. Based on the nodal forces and nodal displacements obtained from finite element analysis, a formula for shell elements to compute stress intensity factors is proposed in the view of virtual crack closure technique. Neither special singular elements nor the collapsed element technique is used at the crack tip. The established FCG-System cannot only treat problems with a single crack, but also handle problems with multiple cracks in case of simultaneous but uneven growth. The accuracy and the robustness of FCG-System are demonstrated by two illustrative examples. No stability and convergence difficulties have been encountered in these cases and meanwhile, insensitivity to the mesh size is confirmed. Therefore, the FCG-System developed by authors could be an efficient tool to perform fatigue crack growth analysis on marine structures. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

After that, the evaluation criteria are assessed, through the process of personal interviews and questionnaires, from different groups of stakeholders, and then the AHP method is implemented in order to produce the relative importance of the criteria. Finally, all exclusion criteria are performed to a unique layer of GIS and the combination emerged constitutes the exclusion map. However, the evaluation criteria are classified to scale from 1 to 5 (5 the higher suitability) and a layer for each criterion is also produced and the final evaluation map with a ranking suitability from 1-5.

A postal survey was conducted to investigate fishers' attitudes towards offshore energy extraction and any influential factors in terms of fishing experience and practice, association membership, location, and knowledge of offshore renewable energy installations. The most important factor influencing fishers' opinions was whether they knew of a nearby offshore development, followed by location (whether they operate from the mainland or the islands); and despite concerns regarding the perceived impacts and mitigation the majority of fishers held either neutral or positive attitudes towards offshore renewable energy extraction.

Bioconstructions built by alien species may offer sheltered microhabitats for motile (vagile) animals but biofouling often becomes detrimental to human activities. In this context, the present study provides an inventory of 1) the extent of biofouling related to the alien Polychaeta Ficopomatus enigmaticus on hard structures of marinas in Normandy, France, and 2) the biodiversity of sessile (attached) or vagile (motile) fauna associated with these reefs, including both native and alien species. Reefs built by F. enigmaticus were found in 6 out of 12 marinas with oligohaline-mesohaline waters. Significant differences in the total volume of biofouling were found among sites, with maximum values observed in Honfleur's old basin (459.52 mL per 0.04 m(2)). Ficopomatus enigmaticus greatly dominated the sessile invertebrate community both in volume (74-100%) and weight (70-100%) in 5 out of 6 marinas. The fouling formed by 5 alien species was colonized by 15 motile invertebrate taxa, including 3 cryptogenic or alien species. The alien crab Rhithropanopeus harrisi displayed the highest frequency of occurrence (> 80%) and mean density (> 300 ind m(-2)), and the global densities of sessile (except F. enigmaticus) and motile fauna were significantly correlated (r = 0.824; p < 0.05). While motile fauna density was also significantly correlated with the biovolume of B. improvisus and M. leucophaeata, it was not with F. enigmaticus (r = 0.421; p > 0.05). In line with previous studies, these results suggest that F. enigmaticus acts as an engineer offering shelter for reef-associated organisms. In addition, results suggest that at the regional scale, inter-site differences in motile fauna may reflect differences in environmental parameters such as salinity. The presence of F. enigmaticus at low salinity levels led to assess its potential distribution at the scale of the European coasts, suggesting that in the context of climate change, favorable conditions for spawning (> 18 degrees C) will likely expand towards the North, and particularly in the eastern and northern Baltic Sea.",,,,,,,,,15,0,1,0,13,0,16,,,0272-7714,1096-0015,,,,,,,,,,"Normandie Univ, F-14032 Caen, FranceUniv Caen Normandie, UMR BOREA Biol Organismes & Ecosyst Aquat, MNHN, UPMC,UCN,CNRS 7208,IRD 207, F-14032 Caen 5, FranceSorbonne Univ, UPMC Univ Paris 06, CNRS, LOV, Villefranche Sur Mer, FranceIFREMER, Lab Environm & Resources Bretagne Nord, 38 Rue Port Blanc,BP 80108, F-35801 Dinard, FranceCNRS, UMR BOREA 7208, 61 Rue Buffon,CP 53, F-75231 Paris 05, FranceMNHN, Stn Biol Marine, BP 225, F-29182 Concarneau, France",Normandie Univ,,,2018-12-28,WOS:000446286100017,,,,,

Qualitative decisions about what to protect in situ, avoid, or excavate requires an objective understanding of significance assessment in relation to risk.

Year-classes(age groups)were estimated for these cohorts after considering the growth pattern of each cohort and the number of clams that recruited. We concluded that the population consisted of 2011-year-class clams that recruited massively to the tidal flat after the earthquake and 2010-year-class that were stranded by the tsunami. After tracking the growth rate of the clams, we estimated that the clams would reach a commercial size(SL 30 mm)in four years after recruiting to the mudflat.

Where space is not limiting, African Penguins may also change sites. Constraints on nomadism include strong attachment to traditional breeding localities, unwillingness to roost at non-breeding localities, and lack of suitable alternative nesting localities. Amongst causes of nomadism are excessive disturbance by humans and South African Fur Seals Arctocephalus pusillus and competition for breeding space, which have resulted in even the least nomadic of the species changing their breeding locations. Regularly nomadic species are likely to respond to environmental cues that enable them either to reduce cost of breeding or to increase reproductive output. Therefore, they are potentially useful indicators of ecological health. Nomadic breeders additionally have the ability to establish new breeding colonies. Some species have used artificial structures to expand their breeding range, and probably also to increase their overall populations.

Most of them are nonindigenous species that tolerate wide fluctuations in temperature, salinity, and even pollution. These sessile suspension feeders have a rapid growth rate, usually a short life span of a few months, reach sexual maturity when only a few weeks old, and produce large numbers of short-lived nonfeeding planktonic larvae. They thrive on marina floats, pilings, buoys, and boat bottoms in protected harbors where there is reduced wave action and enhanced nutrients from anthropogenic activities. Nonindigenous ascidians frequently overgrow oysters and mussels, which are often cultivated in or near busy harbors. Adult ascidians on ship or barge hulls may survive transport over thousands of kilometers to harbors with conditions similar to those they left; occasionally live larvae have also been recovered from ships' ballast water. U.S. Navy dry dock movements between major Pacific ports have transported large masses of fouling nonindigenous taxa, including ascidians. Transfer between culture sites of oysters, mussels, and associated lines and nets may provide an additional mode of transport. Once nonindigenous ascidians become established, they provide large local sources of larvae for further possible invasions into additional harbors and nearby natural marine communities. Invasive species include both solitary and colonial forms, with a preponderance of large solitary species that thrive in highly disturbed habitats. In Guam, for example, most nonindigenous ascidians are confined to harbor structures and have not as yet significantly colonized natural reefs. In contrast, healthy natural benthic regions both inside and outside the harbors of Guam are usually stable coral reef communities containing a high diversity, but very low biomass, of native colonial ascidian species. However, in several areas of the Caribbean a native colonial didemnid has recently begun overgrowing coral reefs. In the Gulf of Mexico a nonindigenous didemnid now covers many offshore oil rigs and may become a threat to neighboring natural reefs. Additional data on nonindigenous ascidians in Australia, Palau, Hawai'i, and the Mediterranean are included. Although serious invasion of coral reefs has not yet been reported, more studies and regular monitoring are needed.",,,,,,,,,110,2,0,0,115,2,134,,,0030-8870,,,,,,,,,,,"12001 11th Avenue NW, Seattle, WA, 98177, USA",,,,2002-07-01,BCI:BCI200200534704,,,,,

Beam trawling has affected macrobenthic assemblages for centuries, especially the fragile and long-lived species. Due to the prohibition of bean trawling in many OWFs, opportunities are being provided to investigate the potential recovery of vulnerable species and the creation of de-facto Marine Protected Areas (MPAs). The soft-substrate macrobenthic community was investigated from 2008 to 2012, before and after the construction of an OWF in the Belgian part of the North Sea, situated on the Bligh Bank. The fishery enclosed area (+/-21 km(2)) within the OWF (No Fishery area) was compared with a surrounding control area (+/-30 km(2)) where regular fishing activities were registered through vessel monitoring system (VMS) data throughout the period 2010-2011. Three years after the exclusion of beam trawl fisheries, subtle changes within the macrobenthic community were observed in the No Fishery area. The benthic mysid shrimp Gastrosaccus spinifer (30 +/- 15 ind m(-2)), tube-building polychaetes Terebellidae sp. (196 +/- 151 ind m(-2)) and the echinoderm Echinocyamus pusillus (73 +/- 71 ind m(-2)), sensitive to trawling activities, showed increased abundances within the No Fishery area. With an expansion of the wind farm concession area to 238 km(2) in the future, the likely increase of dense Terebellidae patches (e.g., Lanice conchilega reefs) within the No Fishery area could create an ecological important large-scale refugium for higher trophic levels. This study creates a baseline for the evaluation of long-term changes due to the fishing impacts and effects related to the presence of OWFs and highlights the importance of executing long-term monitoring programs in combination with targeted research.

We analyzed terrestrial habitat use phenology of a tropical otariid, the Galapagos sea lion Zalophus wollebaeki. Regular land-based censuses were carried out in Wreck Bay of San Cristobal Island, Galapagos, between 2008 and 2012 to explore seasonal changes in sea lion abundance, distribution, and preferences among different habitat types. A daily cycle of haul-out patterns was observed. Animals aggregated on sandy beaches during the coldest periods of the day and were more abundant on rocky and artificial structures when air temperature was warmer. The use of artificial floating platforms as resting places by Z. wollebaeki was described for the first time and linked to environmental variability, suggesting that this may be a successful management tool for pinnipeds inhabiting low latitudes. Further, this species demonstrated seasonal distribution changes, aggregating in high densities during warm seasons and maintaining more even distributions during cold seasons. Sea surface temperature, air temperature, and the onset of the breeding season were the variables that most significantly influenced haul-out patterns of Z. wollebaeki, indicating that this species can adapt to changing environmental conditions by displaying a high degree of plasticity regarding its distribution and terrestrial microhabitat preferences.",,,,,,,,,11,0,0,0,10,0,12,,,1863-5407,1613-4796,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2015-12-07,WOS:000335582400002,,,,,

DC collection systems have the advantages of reduced weight and size of the DC cables and DC cables are free from reactive power compensation. The heavy 50/60 Hz transformers in the offshore transmission platform of AC collection systems can be replaced with smaller size medium frequency transformers in DC collection systems. However, the need for a high power DC DC converter with high voltage transformation ratios and DC protection methods will remain a challenge for the DC collection systems. Also, DC collection systems do not necessarily reduce the power conversion stages compared to the AC collection systems even if HVDC (High Voltage DC) transmission is used to transfer the offshore wind power from the collection systems to the onshore grids. A cost assessment study verifies that the cost reductions achieved by the reduced size of the DC cables and offshore platform are outweighed by the cost of DC protective devices and DC-DC converters. This is because the length of the DC collection cables is relatively short compared to the long distance HVDC cables. The technical comparison supported by the simulation results shows that the total losses in the DC collection systems are higher than in AC collection systems. The effect of collection bus voltages on the losses is analysed for the DC collection systems. (C) 2015 The Authors.

In it, I foreground the complex ways not yet built infrastructure affect Sino-Vietnamese relations as well as our theoretical understanding of the state, especially with regard to Vietnam. Not yet built infrastructure refers to more than the assemblage of things that will be built in the future to power the economy, such as oil rigs, natural gas pipelines, and refineries. The concept also includes the ideological positions that presuppose the materialization of blueprint plans in physical form, i.e., the broader goals such infrastructure is meant to achieve. Towards this end, the article focuses on how state actors and their proxies conceptualize the likely impacts not yet built infrastructure will have upon their respective interests once construction is completed.

Subsequent patterns of recruit abundance ( < 3 wks old) on the artificial reefs were not obscured by post-recruitment mortality due to predation. These results motivated an experiment designed to assess whether predation pressure on artificial reefs was representative of predation pressure on natural reefs. The results indicated that prey on artificial reefs were less likely to encounter large predatory fish than prey on natural reefs. Tethered fish disappeared at a greater rate on natural reefs than on artificial reefs, and such losses were minimal within cages that excluded large predatory fish. These findings highlight the potential for predation pressure to vary among different habitat types and a need for care when choosing the habitats in which to study the effects of predation.

A mixed- methods approach made up of 400 fisherfolk households survey and 42 interviews with stakeholders in the fisheries and the petroleum industries were conducted. The study shows that fisherfolk in the Western Region of Ghana are under high socioeconomic vulnerability because of decreased fish catch and declining coastal livelihoods. The spatial restriction of fishers' mobility offshore, the destruction and confiscation of fishing gear, the presence of seaweed in the ocean, and the lack of land opportunities are some of the key petroleum-induced stressors on fisheries livelihoods.

Mail questionnaires received (N = 36) from charter boat operators included information on sport fish species pursued, locations fished, number of trips and number of clientele entertained, gross revenues collected, expenditures incurred, and number of employees hired in 2001. Sport fish species or species groups that were most pursued in descending order of preference were sea trout (Cynoscion spp.), snapper (Lutjanus spp.), redfish (Sciaenops ocellatus) mackerel (Scomberomorus spp.), and sharks (Carcharhinus spp., Sphyrna spp., Isrus spp., Rhizoprionodon spp.). Captains reported open saltwater, offshore shipwrecks, oil rigs, sandbars off barrier islands, and inland shipwrecks as the top five locations fished during charter trips. Charter boat captains offered half-, full-, and multiple-day fishing trips with the latter yielding the greatest mean gross revenue annually (US$49,300), while more clients fished in the full-day arrangement (x = 280 clients/year). The charter industry generated a total economic impact of $5.9 million to $6.7 million to the State of Mississippi and $5.3 million to $6.0 million to the three coastal counties of Hancock, Harrison, and Jackson. Information gained through studies of this type that identify economic benefits of fish and wildlife recreation and associated ecosystems that support species of interest, can be used by natural resource managers and policymakers to develop strategies for the pragmatic conservation of important coastal ecosystems.",,,,,57th Annual Conference of the Southeastern-Association-of-Fish-and-Wildlife-Agencies57th Annual Conference of the Southeastern-Association-of-Fish-and-Wildlife-Agencies,"OCT 11-15, 2003OCT 11-15, 2003",SE Assoc Fish & Wildlife AgcySE Assoc Fish & Wildlife Agcy,"Mobile, ALMobile, AL",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,*************,,,,,,,,,"Mississippi State Univ, Dept Forestry, Mississippi State, MS 39762 USA",,,,2003-01-01,WOS:000228129800011,,,,,

Lake fish species may occupy the littoral zone permanently or visit it on diel, seasonal or ontogenetic timescales in response to a range of intrinsic and extrinsic factors. The purposes of such occupations include feeding, refuge from predation and, most importantly for many species, reproduction. The primary environmental threats to fish in the littoral zone arise from eutrophication, which may directly or indirectly alter feeding conditions through the loss of macrophytes, from increases or decreases in water level variations and from siltation rates, both of which may interfere with spawning or egg incubation, and from the introduction of alien species, many of which preferentially colonise the littoral zone where they may act as predators, competitors or environmental degraders. The management of these threats is best accomplished through general lake management measures such as the control of nutrient levels, but some actions specific to the littoral zone or its fish populations are also feasible. These include the replacement of lost or damaged spawning substrata, the active management of water levels at appropriate times of year, and, at least potentially, the deployment of artificial structures to provide appropriate physical habitat for adult fish.",,,,,Lake Shores 2003 International ConferenceLake Shores 2003 International Conference,"JUN 19-21, 2003JUN 19-21, 2003",,"Konstanz, GERMANYKonstanz, GERMANY",74,0,0,0,61,2,87,,,0075-9511,,,,,,,,,,,"CEH Windermere, Ambleside LA22 0LP, Cumbria, England",,,,2004-05-01,WOS:000222030800017,,,,,

In the Weser estuary, Germany, 60% of the shoreline is covered with such artificial substrates while, natural rocky substrate is lacking, as in all Wadden Sea estuaries. This large quantity of artificial substrates may be colonized by a benthic hard-substrate community which differs from the local natural soft-substrate assemblage. In this study we examined species compositions, abundances, biomass, and numbers of species of subtidal benthic communities on groynes and in the natural habitat, the sediment, along the salinity gradient of the Weser estuary. Species composition changed on both substrates significantly with salinity and was also significantly different between the substrates. In a comparison with the sediment, the groynes did not provide any benefit for non-indigenous nor for endangered species in terms of abundance, biomass, and number of species, but represent habitats with higher total abundances and biomass; though some non-indigenous species even occurred exclusively on groynes. In particular, groynes supported filter-feeding organisms which play an important role by linking benthic and pelagic food webs. The dominance of the suspension feeders affects crucial estuarine ecosystem services and may have important implications for the estuarine management by altering the estuarine ecological quality status. Hence, artificial substrates should be considered in future conservation planning and in ecological quality monitoring of the benthic fauna according to the European Water Framework Directive.

Using a transdisciplinary research approach, an understanding of the rationalities and interests among the different involved stakeholder groups was explored. Offshore wind energy is high on the political agenda in Germany. The vast spatial requirements however inherit potential user conflicts with competing, and under current legislation excluded users such as fishermen. Solutions for combining sustainable uses of the same ocean space have thus seen increasing interest within the research community in Germany and in Europe over the past years. This paper was inspired by and presents the outcomes of a stakeholder analysis and in particular a stakeholder workshop. Central focus was placed on academics and private as well as public stakeholders engaged in current research efforts of combining offshore wind farms and aquaculture in the German North Sea. The paper identifies the overall acceptance of such a multi-use scenario in society, opportunities and constraints as perceived by the stakeholders, and key research gaps. The results confirm the assumption that there is a clear need, and also willingness on behalf of the policy makers and the research community, to find sustainable, resource- and space-efficient solutions for combined ocean use.

(2) The trade mark of the 'good reef' might be fixed as in the following, the fact that the reef should be more than 4 m in its height, that the concrete blocks should be deposited to form a high hill-like figure, that the concrete blocks should be submerged to form a sort of congregation consisting of the individual reefs having different constructions. Of these three, the reef having the shape of two-headed-hill was fixed to be the best one, with the excellent capacity to have gathered 2 or 3 tones of Chiken grunt Parapristipoma trilineatum schools around it.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,0453-087X,,,,,,,,,,,"LABORATORY OF FISHING GEAR, FACULTY OF FISHERIES, KAGOSHIMA UNIVERSITY, 4-50-20, SHIMOARATA, KAGOSHIMA, 890, JAPAN",,,,1986-01-01,BCI:BCI198784013600,,,,,

Increasing percentage hard substrate and the number of small reef holes increased fish abundance on reefs. The observed number of species (S-obs) occurring on each reef increased with increasing rugosity, variety of growth forms, percentage hard substrate, and variety of refuge hole sizes. A rarefied or abundance -corrected species richness measure (S,a,e) was calculated to take the varying fish abundances into account. After this correction, rugosity was the only variable that significantly increased fish species-richness. Experimental reefs of different height (20 and 60 cm) did not have significantly different fish abundance or species richness. The presence of long-spined sea urchins Diadema antillarum increased Sob, and total fish abundance on artificial rock-reefs and in seagrass beds, but the effect was most pronounced in seagrass beds where shelter was a strongly limiting factor. These results indicate that complex habitats or animals such as D. antillarum that provide shelter to fish are essential for maintaining fish biodiversity at local scales. The most important aspects of complexity are rugosity, hard substrate and small refuge holes. Artificial reefs may be used to mitigate habitat damage in impacted areas, and if management objectives are to increase local fish abundance and species richness, the reefs should provide a stable substrate where this is unavailable, have a rugose surface with many small refuge holes, and have a variety of growth forms.",,,,,,,,,188,1,0,0,175,7,230,,,0171-8630,1616-1599,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Oxford, Dept Zool, S Parks Rd, Oxford OX1 3JA, England",,,,2005-01-01,WOS:000229927900026,,,,,

An Ecopath model, with 20 functional groups representing 81 species, was developed for a representative area in the region and Ecosim was used to explore two scenarios for alternative fishing practices and surrounding aqua culture activities. The mean trophic levels (TLs) of the functional groups ranged from 1.0 for the primary producers (phytoplankton, benthic algae and seagrass) and detritus to 4.14 for Type III fishes (fishes found in the water column above the artificial reefs, e.g., Scomberomorus niphonius). The mean transfer efficiency through the whole system was 11.7%, and the ecosystem had a relative low maturity, stability and disturbance resistance, indicating that it was at a developing stage. Nearly half of the total system biomass (48.9% of 620.20 t km(-2) year(-1)), excluding detritus, was comprised of benthic finfish and invertebrates. The total yield from all fisheries (86.82 t/km(2)/year) was dominated by low trophic level herbivorous and detritivorous species, such as the sea cucumber Apostichopus japonicus (TL = 2.1, 46.07%), other echinoderms (sea urchins Asterias amurensis and Strongylocentrotus nudus, TL = 2.1, 34.6%) and abalone Haliotis discus hannai (TL= 2.0, 18.4%), and as a consequence, the mean TL of the catch was low (2.1). The results from the Ecosim simulation of closing all fisheries for 20 years predicted an increase of about 100% in the relative biomass of the main exploited species, A. japonicus and H. discus hannai. The simulated removal of all kelp farms over 10 years resulted in a two fold increase in the relative biomass of Type III fishes and a 120% increase in their main prey (i.e. Small pelagic fish), while the relative biomass of A. japonicus and Heterotrophic bacteria decreased by 31.4% and 12.7%, respectively. These predictions indicate that nearshore kelp cultivation favours benthic, rather than water column production, and is likely to be providing energy subsidies for the stock enhancement of benthic species in this region.

R,"Van Den Brenk, S",,,,,,,,,,Hollandse Kust (Zuid) Desk study archaeological assessment,,,,,,,,Data Archiving and Networked Services (DANS-KNAW),,,,,,,,,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.17026/dans-x5u-62n5,,,,,,,Data study,2020-05-06,2017,"SUMMARY (EN)Periplus Archeomare was assigned by RVO to conduct an archaeological assessment of the Hollandse Kust (Zuid) Windfarm Zone.Within the investigated area of the wind farm zones there is a high expectation for the presence of (remains of) ship wrecks and WWII plane wrecks. Locally in situ remains of Late Paleolithic and Early Mesolithic camp sites might be present.Parts of the research area have been investigated by geophysical surveys in the past.During the geophysical survey for Luchterduinen, which covers approximately 5 percent of the area, three objects were classified as of possible archaeological value. During the geophysical survey for Delta Hydrocarbons, which covers approximately 2 percent of the area, no objects were classified as of possible archaeological value.Over 90 % of surface of the wind farm area has not been investigated by detailed geophysical surveys. The area may contain more undiscovered shipwrecks or remains of shipwrecks.ShipwrecksA total of 19 shipwrecks are known in the area. Details like names, types and date of sinking are not known, nor are the exact locations. Further research is needed to determine the cultural-historical value.Plane wrecksDuring World War II, many airplanes crashed into the North Sea. Several sources are ambiguous about the number of aircraft still missing. It is at least hundreds. Remains are found on a regular base by fishermen or during sand extraction. In the vicinity of the research area, four locations of plane wrecks are known. It is quite possible to expect plane wrecks within the research area.PrehistoryRemains of prehistoric camp sites are expected in situ in cover of sand dunes and ridges (Wierden Member), river dunes (Delwijnen Member) and river bank deposits (Wijchen Member) provided these units are un-eroded. Within the Basal Peat Bed well-preserved lost objects and dumps can be encountered. The archaeological levels of interest are located under a 0 - 5 meter cover of the Bligh Bank Member. Remains of Neanderthaler camp sites can be expected within lacustrine clays of the Brown Bank Member which is covered by the Kreftenheye Formation. At this stage little is known about the integrity of the Pleistocene landscape. The Pleistocene units are encountered at shallow depths. Therefore erosion of these units and archaeological remains therein seems likely. Locally the Basal Peat Bed might have protected the Pleistocene landscape against erosion. By means of subbottom profiling in combination with analysis of vibro core samples the Basal Peat Bed and the underlying well-preserved archaeological level can be mapped. It is unlikely however that archaeological remains of Paleolithic and Mesolithic camp sites can be identified with sufficient certainty (based on the geophysical and geotechnical surveys) to impose restrictions on wind farm development.In accordance with the AMZ cycle it is advised to conduct a field investigation (in Dutch Inventariserend veldonderzoek opwaterfase) in order to:Map the locations of known wreck sites in great detail;Make an inventory for the parts of the area which have not been covered in previous surveysIn general, similar investigations carried out in the past consist of a geophysical survey with side scan sonar, magnetometer and subbottom profiler. The resulting data should be assessed after the general processing, interpretation and reporting has been performed by the survey contractor, if possible in combination with analysis of core samples. The archaeological assessment of the data has to be conducted by a geophysical specialist (KNA prospector Waterbodems).The data quality expected from the surveys need to match the demands for this archaeological assessment. To ensure compatibility between the site investigation and the required quality for this assessment it is recommended to define a Program of requirements (In Dutch: Programma van Eisen) in accordance with the KNA (the Dutch quality standards for archeological research), to be authorized by the competent authority.During the installation of the wind turbines and construction of the cables archaeological remains may be encountered that were fully covered by sediment or not identified as archaeological remains during the geophysical survey. In accordance with the Malta convention incorporated in the Monuments Act through the Archaeological Heritage Management Act (Revised 2007) it is required to report those findings to the competent authority. This notification for archaeological finds should be included in the specifications or scope of work.SAMENVATTING (NL)In opdracht van de Rijksdienst voor Ondernemend Nederland (RVO) heeft Periplus Archeomare B.V. een archeologisch bureauonderzoek uitgevoerd voor het toekomstige windpark Hollandse Kust (Zuid).Voor het onderzoeksgebied bestaat een hoge verwachting voor de aanwezigheid van (resten van) scheepswrakken en vliegtuigwrakken uit de Tweede Wereldoorlog. Daarnaast is het aannemelijk dat vanwege de post-glaciale zeespiegelstijging in situ resten van kampementen van jagers/verzamelaars uit het Late-Paleolithicum en het Vroeg-Mesolithicum kunnen worden aangetroffen.Delen van het onderzoeksgebied zijn in het verleden al vlakdekkend onderzocht met geofysische technieken.Tijdens de geofysische survey voor windgebied Luchterduinen, wat ongeveer 5 procent van het windgebied Hollandse Kust (Zuid) beslaat, zijn geen objecten met mogelijke archeologische waarde gerapporteerd.Meer dan 90% van het windgebied is nog niet in detail onderzocht door middel van geofysische survey. Het is mogelijk dat onbekende (resten van) wrakken aanwezig zijn.ScheepswrakkenBinnen het onderzoeksgebied zijn in totaal 19 scheepswrakken bekend. De exacte locatie en verdere details als scheepsnamen, scheepstypes zijn niet bekend. Aanvullend onderzoek is nodig om de cultuur-historische waarde van deze wrakken vast te stellen.VliegtuigwrakkenGedurende de Tweede Wereldoorlog zijn veel vliegtuigen neergestort in de Noordzee. Verschillende bronnen zijn onduidelijk over het aantal vliegtuigen dat nog vermist wordt, maar het moeten er honderden zijn. Zowel tijdens zandwinning en kust beschermingsproject als door visser worden regelmatig resten van vliegtuigen aangetroffen. In de omgeving van het onderzoeksgebied zijn vier locaties bekend met vliegtuigresten. PrehistorieDe verwachting voor de Prehistorie (Paleo-Meso) is hoog onder hogere zandduinen en richels (Wierden Member), op de afgedekte rivier duinen (Delwijnen Member) en overafzettingen (Wijchen Member). In het Basisveenpakket is de verwachting hoog voor wat betrerft losse vondsten en rituele deposities.. De archeologische interessante niveaus liggen onder de afzettingen van het Bligh Bank Member pakket met een dikte van 0 tot 5m dikte. Resten van Neanderthaler kampen kunnen worden verwacht in de Onder de lacustriene kleiafzettingen van de Brown Bank Member is een hoge verwachting voor het Paleolithicum (Neanderthaler). De Brown Bank Member afzettingen zijn veelal afgedekt door de Kreftenheye Formatie.Op dit moment is weinig bekend over de integriteit van het Pleistocene landschap. De Pleistocene liggen dicht onder de zeebodem. Hierdoor is de kans op erosie aannemelijk. Lokaal kan het bovengelegen Basisveen het Pleistocene landschap hebben beschermd tegen erosie. Voor beter onderbouwd verwachtingsmodel adviseren wij een subbottom profiling onderzoek uit te voeren in combinatie met de analyse van vibro core samples. Daarmee kunnen het basisveen en de onderliggende goed bewaarde archeologische lagen beter worden gekarteerd. De aanwezigheid van Paleolithische en Mesolitische nederzettingsresten is op basis van dit onderzoek echter niet met volledige zekerheid vast te stellen. Het daardoor lastig om archeologische beperkingen op te leggen aan de ontwikkeling van het windpark.In overeenstemming met het AMZ-cyclus wordt geadviseerd om een inventariserend veldonderzoek opwaterfase' uit te voeren om:- De locaties van bekende wrakken in meer detail te karteren;- De delen van het gebied waar nog geen survey opnames zijn uitgevoerd te inventariseren.Vergelijkbare geofysische onderzoeken bestaan over het algemeen uit surveys met side scan sonar, magnetometer en een subbottom profiler. De resulterende data moeten geanalyseerd worden na oplevering van de gegevens door het surveybedrijf. De archeologische analyse van de gegevens dient te gebeuren door een geofysisch specialist (KNA prospector waterbodems).Het onderzoek moet voldoen aan de Kwaliteitsnorm Archeologisch Onderzoek (KNA). Om dit te waarborgen worden de eisen voorafgaand aan het onderzoek vastgelegd in een Programma van Eisen (PvE), dat is goedgekeurd door het bevoegd gezag.Zoals gezegd blijven onderzekerheden bestaan omtrent de aanwezigheid van archeologische waarden in het plangebied. Dat betekent dat dat ook tijdens de bouw onverwacht archeologische waarden kunnen worden aangetroffen. De civiel uitvoerder is conform de Monumentenwet 1988 (herzien in 2007) verplicht om dergelijke vondsten te melden bij de bevoegde overheid. Deze meldingsplicht voor archeologische vondsten moet als protocol in het bestek of Plan van Aanpak van het werk opgenomen.

Most of the colonies settled in man-made structures such as islets, levees, dams, located inside fish farms, fish ponds and salt pans. Laying took place around half May until early June (Veneto), with eggs occurring in the nests until half July (Sardinia). Colonies had 3-230 pairs, with several instances of isolated pairs; colonies were mono- or plurispecific, with other Charadriiformes. The number of eggs per clutch was 2.6[plus or minus]0.6 (N=111, 1 SD) in the Venice lagoon, 2.6[plus or minus]0.6 (N=182) in the Po delta, 2.3[plus or minus]0.70 (N=1007) in Sardinia; hatched eggs were 2.2[plus or minus]0.6 (N=111), 2.0[plus or minus]0.7 (N=182) and 1.7[plus or minus]0.67 (N=40) per nest, respectively. The most important cause of breeding failure was due to flooding of nesting sites, due to the rapid increase of water levels inside fish farms and salt pans. During the 2001-2018 years, the Gull-billed Tern nested regularly in Sardinia, whereas in the Po Delta the first nesting occurred in 2001 and in the lagoon of Venice in 2008. The whole population ranged between 34 and 417 pairs until 2017 (223.6[plus or minus]113.4, N=17), with a sudden increase up to almost 1,000 pairs in 2018; the overall trend is of strong increase (p<0.01), with an annual rate of 10.5%.",,,,,,,,,3,0,0,0,2,0,3,,,0035-6875,,,,,,,,,,,"Grp Ornitol Sardo, CP 160-C, Quart St Elena, CA, I-09045, Italy",,,,2020-11-23,ZOOREC:ZOOR15612087065,,,,,

For large offshore design projects, the level of detail required for a QRA is often not available until well into the detailed design phase of the project. In these cases, the QRA may be unable to provide timely hazard understanding. As a result, the risk reduction measures identified often come too late to allow for cost effective changes to be implemented. This forces project management to make a number of difficult or costly decisions.This paper demonstrates how a scenario-based approached to fire risk assessment can be effectively applied early in a project's development. The scenario or design basis fire approach calculates the consequence of a select number of credible fire scenarios, determines the potential impact on the platform process equipment, structural members, egress routes, safety systems, and determines the effectiveness of potential options for mitigation. The early provision of hazard data allows the project team to select an optimum design that is safe and will meet corporate or regulatory risk criteria later in the project cycle.The focus of this paper is on the application of the scenario-based approach to gas jet fires. This paper draws on recent experience in the Gulf of Mexico (GOM) and other areas to outline an approach to fire hazard analysis and fire hazard management for deep-water structures.

When hydrocarbon from the seabed is extracted for an extended period of time, there might be a reduction in pressure, which allows subsidence to happen. A platform experiencing subsidence promotes the decrease in air gaps, which eventually allows the waves to attack the bottom decks. The impact of the WID generates additional loads to the structure and therefore increases the values of the moment arms. Higher moment arms trigger instability in terms of overturning, which eventually decreases the reserve strength ratio (RSR) values of the structure. The mechanics of WIDs, however, are still not well understood and have not been fully incorporated into the design codes and standards. Therefore, there is a need to revisit the current design codes and standards for platform design optimization. This paper aims at evaluating the effect of RSR values due to WID on four-legged jacket platforms in Malaysia. Base shear values with regards to calibration and modifications of wave characteristics are obtained by numerical simulations. Correspondingly, pushover analysis was conducted to retrieve the RSR. The effects of the contributing factors, namely wave height, wave period, and water depth with regards to the RSR and base shear values, are expected to be analyzed and thoroughly discussed. The work illustrated in this paper is important in optimizing the design life of the existing and aging offshore structures.

The beached C-heavy oil tended to remain for a long time on coasts of bedrock and boulder/cobble/pebble but it was removed rapidly from coasts of gravel/sand and man-made structures such as concrete tetrapods. On the coasts of the latter type, wave energy appeared to be the main force removing the oil. One year after the spill, C-heavy oil tended to remain strongly on the sheltered coasts of bedrock and boulder/cobble/pebble. Even on coasts of this type, the contamination was remarkably absent by 2 years after the spill. The concentration levels of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in oil lumps, sand and seawater were monitored during 3 years following the spill. The concentrations of PAHs having 2 or 3 rings decreased more quickly than did those of PAHs having 4 or more rings, suggesting that volatilization was the main cause of the decrease. On the other hand, the concentrations of PAHs having 4 to 6 rings did not start to decrease until 7 months after the spill. The main cause of the decrease seemed to be photolysis. The concentration of BaP in seawater off the polluted coasts was high 1 month after the spill and then decreased. Three years after the spill, the level fell to the sub ng/L level, which was as low as the level in seawater along unpolluted clean coasts in Japan. The concentration of BaP in greenling was higher than the normal level only during the first two months after the spill. These results suggest that the coastlines in Ishikawa and Fukui Prefectures that were polluted with C-heavy oil recovered in 3 years.

Additionally, we examined habitat preferences of new recruits of T. caudimaculatus and V. conspersa using laboratory-based habitat choice experiments. In general, T. caudimaculatus recruitment was at least twice as high on natural reefs compared to both artificial reefs, whereas V. conspersa recruitment was almost three times greater on Reef Ball reefs compared to the other two habitats. T. clarkei recruited in equal numbers across all habitats. However, in the laboratory experiments T. caudimaculatus recruits selected the Reef Ball reef almost three times as often as the other two habitats, while V. conspersa exhibited no habitat preference.

This results in a range of environmental impacts which should be taken into account in a benefit-cost analysis of such proposals. In this paper, we use choice modeling to investigate the relative gains and losses from siting new windfarms off the coast of Estonia, relative to the option of creating a new marine protected area. We find that, while respondents are generally opposed to converting marine shoals to conventional wind farms and prefer the establishment of marine protected areas instead, benefits from constructing environmentally-friendly wind farms - an alternative program which is also considered by the government - are not statistically different with respect to consumers' welfare to those associated with creating a new marine protected area. Methodologically, the paper makes a contribution by showing the ability of the latent class mixed logit model to represent both within- and between-class preference heterogeneity, and thus its power to provide a more sophisticated representation of preference heterogeneity than stand-alone latent class or mixed logit approaches.

We studied whether harbour porpoise occurrence has been affected by the presence of the Dutch offshore wind farm Egmond aan Zee. This was done by studying acoustic activity of porpoises in the wind farm and in two reference areas using stationary acoustic monitoring (with T-PODs) prior to construction (baseline: June 2003 to June 2004) and during normal operation of the wind farm (operation: April 2007 to April 2009). The results show a strong seasonal pattern, with more activity recorded during winter months. There was also an overall increase in acoustic activity from baseline to operation, in line with a general increase in porpoise abundance in Dutch waters over the last decade. The acoustic activity was significantly higher inside the wind farm than in the reference areas, indicating that the occurrence of porpoises in this area increased as well. The reasons of this apparent preference for the wind farm area are not clear. Two possible causes are discussed: an increased food availability inside the wind farm (reef effect) and/or the absence of vessels in an otherwise heavily trafficked part of the North Sea (sheltering effect).",,,,,,,,,83,1,0,0,64,0,92,,,1748-9326,,,,,,,,,,,"IMARES, Dept Ecosyst, NL-1790 AD Den Burg, NetherlandsAarhus Univ, Natl Environm Res Inst, Dept Arct Environm, DK-4000 Roskilde, DenmarkWageningen Univ, Dept Aquat Ecol & Water Qual Management, NL-6700 DD Wageningen, Netherlands",,,,2011-04-01,WOS:000295326800029,,,,,

We consider three of such settings: (1) perform all maintenance tasks, (2) allow for a fraction of unscheduled tasks, and (3) incentivize to perform maintenance rather quickly. We provide a two-stage stochastic mixed integer programming model for the three SMFTPO settings, and solve it by means of Sample Average Approximation. In addition, we provide an overview of the, what we discovered, non-aligned modeling assumptions in the literature regarding operational decisions. By providing a series of special cases of the second-stage problem resembling the different modeling assumptions, we aim to establish a common consensus regarding the key modeling decisions to be taken in maintenance planning problems for offshore wind farms.

These rubble fields can influence marine operations, emergency evacuation systems and can reduce ice loads on the platform. This paper analyzes the historical rubble information-that has been collected pertaining to the nearshore Beaufort Sea and it examines potential empirical relationships between rubble field characteristics and a variety of ice and environmental parameters. Historically, offshore structures in this region were in open water for approximately 100 days. During the remaining time, quasi-stable, grounded rubble could be present around a structure for extended periods for example, on average 65% of the time that there was moving pack ice in the autumn. Rubble fields formed between 76%-87% of the time when a drilling structure was in water depths from 5 to 32 m. This review shows that grounded rubble fields in the Beaufort Sea can be extensive with areas up to 1 km(2) with maximum sail heights up to 14 m. The extent and shape of each field is interdependent upon a number of factors, such as water depth, number of days the site is in moving ice, and the size and shape of an island, caisson or a submarine berm. But no one factor could guarantee the formation of grounded rubble. Upper bounds to the size of a rubble field are proposed based upon three separate data sets. The potential presence of rubble to such a great degree indicates that operators should clearly identify the Strategies to be used to either manage grounded ice rubble or account for its presence with respect to marine operations and emergency evacuation methods. However, the data also show that rubble fields often don't form, even if conditions seem to be favorable for their formation. Crown Copyright (C) 2015 Published by Elsevier B.V.

Artificial reefs have been deployed in 22 countries worldwide (Seaman, 2002) and have been used for a wide range of roles, yet the scientific literature regarding artificial reef research is still fraught with problems and controversy. In an effort to provide a strong base for future research this paper reviews a small cross-section of the ecological studies carried out on artificial reefs. The review found that lack of experimental replication was a consistent problem, with small sample sizes resulting in low statistical power. Additionally pseudoreplication of data was deemed to be an issue because of the lack of independence between sample sites. The studies reviewed tend to be limited by the economics and legal limitations of artificial reef deployment, and so in all but two of the studies artificial reefs deployed for another purpose were used in the experiment. In the future, replication is the key to obtaining meaningful quantitative data in artificial reef research.

It brings together the UK's leading institutions in Wind Energy, the University of Strathclyde, and Marine Energy, the University of Edinburgh. The wider aim, drawing on existing links to the European Research Community, is to maintain a growing research capability, with the DTC at is core, that is internationally leading in wind and marine energy and on a par with the leading centres in Denmark, the USA, Germany and the Netherlands. To meet the interdisciplinary research demands of this sector requires a critical mass of staff and early stage researchers, of the sort that this proposal would deliver, to be brought together with all the relevant skills.Between the two institutions, academic staff have in-depth expertise covering the wind and wave resource, aerodynamics and hydrodynamics, design of wind turbines and marine energy devices, wind farms, fixed and floating structures, wind turbine, wind farm and marine energy devices control, power conversion, condition monitoring, asset management, grid-integration issues and economics of renewable energy. A centre of learning and research with strong links to the Wind and Marine Energy industry will be created that will provide a stimulating environment for the PhD students. In the first year of a four year programme, a broad intensive training will be provided to the students in all aspects of Wind and Marine Energy together with professional engineer training in research, communication, business and entrepreneurial skills. The latter will extend throughout the four years of the programme. Research will be undertaken in all aspects of Wind and Marine Energy.A DTC in Wind and Marine Energy Systems is vital to the UK energy sector for a number of reasons. The UK electricity supply industry is currently undergoing a challenging transition driven by the need to meet the Government's binding European targets to provide 15% of the UK's total primary energy consumption from renewable energy sources by 2020. Given that a limited proportion of transport and heating energy will come from such sources, it is expected that electricity supply will make the major contribution to this target. As a consequence, 40% or more of electricity will have to be generated from non-thermal sources. It is predicted that the UK market for both onshore and offshore wind energy is set to grow to £20 billion by 2015.There is a widely recognised skills gap in renewable energy that could limit this projected growth in the UK and elsewhere unless the universities dramatically increase the scale of their activities in this area.At the University of Strathclyde, the students will initially be housed in the bespoke accommodation in the Royal College Building allocated and refurbished for the existing DTC in Wind and Marine Energy Systems then subsequently in the Technology and Innovation Centre Building when it is completed. At the University of Edinburgh, the students will be housed in the bespoke accommodation in the Kings Buildings allocated and refurbished for the existing IDC in Offshore Renewable Energy. The students will have access to the most advanced design, analysis and simulation software tools available, including the industry standard wind turbine and wind farm design tools and a wide range of power system and computation modelling packages.Existing very strong links to industry of the academic team will be utilised to provide strategic guidance to the proposed DTC in Wind and Marine Energy through company membership of its Industrial Advisory Board and participation in 8 week 7 projects as part of the training year and in 3 year PhD projects. In addition, to providing suggestions for projects and engaging in the selection process, the Industry Partners provide support in the form of data, specialist software, access to test-rigs and advice and guidance to the students.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,EP/L016680/1,,,,,,,,University of Strathclyde,,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:15396197,,,,,

The artificial reef modules were also rapidly colonized by coral recruits. Recruit densities were 53 +/- SE 3.2 m(-2) on modules that had been submerged for only 1 year, nearly twice as high as recruit densities on natural reef substratum (31 +/- 2.8 m(-2)). Consequently, the original Acropora assemblage had increased to include at least 23 coral taxa, including 10 additional Acropora species. The artificial reefs also supported at least 29 reef fish species, from 11 families. Unfortunately, this initial success in habitat creation was abruptly halted by a rapid rise in sea temperature in May 2010 that killed almost all corals on the artificial reefs and on nearby natural reefs.

Offshore wind systems have been acknowledged as one of the leading solutions to decarbonise energy systems in the UK, with deployment anticipated to reach 84 gigawatts installed capacity by 2050. Due to their wind profile reliability, offshore wind farms offer longer-term solutions than onshore ones. The availability of many suitable sites, the excellent wind resources and the existing capabilities of the offshore petroleum industry make the UK ideally placed to be a world-leading player in floating wind systems. Typically, floating offshore wind farms with power ranging from five to fifty megawatts are expected to be connected to medium voltage power networks, therefore, requiring step-up transformers. Although such transformers have proven robustness, they are expensive and bulky. The project aims to develop a novel power electronics converter to connect floating offshore wind turbines to power networks, ensuring resilience, high efficiency, superior reliability and the least impact on the environment. This will be achieved by undertaking advanced modelling and computer simulation to identify the optimal converter design, followed by the development of intelligent control software to maximise the efficiency and fault-tolerant operation of the converter. The performance of the final design will be validated through prototype hardware implementation and testing in consultation with the industrial partner.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,EP/T026162/1,,,,,,,,Queen's University of Belfast,,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:15352432,,,,,

The present study modelled the growth and feed-backs of blue mussels in natural beds and on turbine foundations in an off-shore wind farm (OWF) located in a shallow coastal ecosystem by coupling a dynamic energy budget (DEB) model to a small-scale 3D hydrodynamic-biogeochemical model. The model results showed that blue mussels located higher up in the water column on turbine pillars achieved a 7-18 times higher biomass than those located on the scour protection because the former experience an enhanced advective food supply, Secondly, the high biomasses of blue mussels on foundations created local 'hot spots' of biological activity and changed ecosystem dynamics due to their feed-backs e.g. ingestion of microplankton and copepods, excretion of ammonium and egestion of faecal pellets. The model results were supported by field measurements around foundations of Chl a concentrations and biomasses of the fauna community. Our study emphasised that OWFs seem to be particularly favourable for blue mussels in the western Baltic Sea and that the functioning of the OWFs as artificial reef ecosystems depends upon how the blue mussels interact with their local pelagic and benthic environment.

In Argentina, the acorn barnacle Balanus glandula not only colonizes rocky shores but has also successfully invaded soft bottom salt marshes, where it form large three-dimensional structures that facilitate the presence of other invertebrates, thus affecting the whole species assemblage. Artificial barnacles were deployed on a Patagonian salt marsh to reproduce the physical structure of natural aggregates. The experiment included natural and material controls and two levels of structural complexity that represent the variety of aggregates found in nature: (i) aggregates with internal empty spaces and galleries among barnacles and (ii) aggregates without spaces and galleries. After nine months, the macroinvertebrate assemblages were compared between treatments. The results showed that the composition of the assemblage differed significantly between artificial treatments and control plots. However, there was no effect of the mimic barnacles on macroinvertebrate richness and diversity. In this way, our results suggest that the physical structure of B. glandula could modify the composition of macroinvertebrate assemblages.

However, at the same time this slows scientific synthesis through increasing uncertainty with respect to the appropriate methodologies to be used to support solving environmental management problems.We analyzed ESA and the underlying concepts based on the variety of available publications and reviews, which revealed a number of different methods, uncertain reliability and robustness. In order to facilitate comparison, evaluation and synthesis of ecosystem service assessments we propose a blueprint for reporting studies in a structured way.

The simulation results are found in good agreement with the experimental measurements. By the non-dimensional analysis, the drag coefficient specified to each model is achieved and the effects of openings are examined. It is found that the key factor affecting the drag coefficient is the open-area ratio. Generally, the drag coefficient is a linear function of the open area ratio with a minus slope. The empirical formulae for the square and circular openings respectively are deduced by means of the multiple regression analysis based on the measured and numerical data.

In the marine environment there are multitude factors that influence the rate and severity of corrosion mechanisms. Marine environments are recognized to be very corrosive for mild and low alloy steels. The corrosion phenomenon it is a constant and continuous problem, often difficult to eliminate completely. Corrosion induced structural failures continue problem in many marine structures such as ship, platform oil rigs, offshore wind farm or port facilities. Sea water it is a complex chemical system which can be influenced by various factors. These include the concentration and access of dissolved oxygen, salinity, concentration of minor ions, biological activity or pollutants. Other factors which influence the rate and severity of corrosion mechanism are temperature, nutrient level, water velocity and depth. The prevention would be more practical and achievable than complete elimination. From an engineering point of view the major interest in corrosion is the kinetics or rate of corrosion process. The principal aim for studying the kinetics of corrosion reactions are to develop empirical relationship that permit the prediction of corrosion rate under conditions that are different from those originally employed and to determine the mechanism of the overall process of degradation. In this research work it is investigated comparatively the corrosion resistance of uncoated naval steel, naval steel coated with polymeric primer and naval steel coated with polymeric primer and epoxy paint layer. All samples have been subjected to corrosion in sea water collected from Black Sea.

Crab-tiling is a method of collection for the shore crab Carcinus maenas, which is then used as angling bait. This fishery operates in estuarine mudflats at a commercial scale, yet its impact on infaunal assemblages has not been quantified. The fishery involves laying hard man-made structures, known as 'crab-tiles', to attract pre-ecdysis C. maenas. Moulting shore crabs are harvested from underneath the tiles during low tide. Infauna surrounding these tiles, which are important prey for over-wintering wading birds and estuarine fishes, are therefore subjected to disturbance from crab-tiling activity. We experimentally manipulated sites on mudflats in 3 previously non-tiled estuaries to determine the impact of crab-tiling on macro-infaunal diversity. In addition to crab-tiled and control plots, treatments were incorporated in order to discriminate between the effects of the tiles and trampling disturbance. Response variables used were sediment penetrability, grain size and organic content as habitat-related variables, and number of taxa and abundance of individual animals as diversity estimators. The effects of crab-tiling on the sediment were contingent on the estuary; those with a greater proportion of fine particles were most affected. Simultaneously, crab-tiling reduced diversity ( number of taxa and abundance of macro-infauna) and altered assemblage structure. The trampling aspect of crab-tiling was found to have the most impact on the sediment and infauna, and so crab-tiling could be managed via control of access and approaches to minimise sediment disturbance.",,,,,,,,,11,0,0,0,11,0,14,,,0171-8630,,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Plymouth, Inst Marine, Marine Biol & Ecol Res Ctr, Plymouth PL4 8AA, Devon, England",,,,2010-01-01,WOS:000280768100011,,,,,

In spite of the number of offshore wind farms has significantly increased and the setup is similar in most of the wind farms, there is still a huge number of specialized and custom parts with a non-negligible supply time. Due to weather and logistic restrictions the active corrective maintenance time can exceed by far the time that it would take in an onshore environment. This paper proposes an algorithm to determine the optimized spare part inventory of production relevant equipment based on failure mode and effects analysis. From the three orthogonal identifiers, named lost capacity, repair complexity and failure probability, the risk priority number is calculated for the non-spare-part-case and for the spare-part-case. A linear optimization reduces the spare part inventory considering the investment costs, the possible lost energy yield and the availability level of the substation. With the developed algorithm, it is possible to determine the maximum achievable availability level.

These molecules are mainly composed of carbohydrates and proteins, but their detailed monomer compositions and seasonal variations are currently unknown. Yet this composition determines the numerous roles of biofilms in these systems. This study investigated the changes in composition of carbohydrates in intertidal microbial mats over a year to decipher seasonal variations in biofilms and in varying hydrodynamic conditions. This work also aimed to assess how these compositions are related to microbial assemblages. In this context, natural biofilms whose development was influenced or not by artificial structures mimicking polychaete tubes were sampled monthly for over a year in intertidal flats of the Chausey archipelago. Biofilms were compared through the analysis of their fatty acid and pigment contents, and the monosaccharide composition of their EPS carbohydrates. Carbohydrates from both colloidal and bound EPS contained mainly glucose and, to a lower extent, galactose and mannose but they showed significant differences in their detailed monosaccharide compositions. These two fractions displayed different seasonal evolution, even if glucose accumulated in both fractions in summer; bound EPS only were affected by artificial biogenic structures. Sediment composition in fatty acids and pigments showed that microbial communities were dominated by diatoms and heterotrophic bacteria. Their relative proportions, as well as those of other groups like cryptophytes, changed between times and treatments. The changes in EPS composition were not fully explained by modifications of microbial assemblages but also depended on the processes taking place in sediments and on environmental conditions. These variations of EPS compositions are likely to alter different ecosystem processes such as biostabilisation or pollutants trapping. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

From a modelling point of view, the creation of new fish biomass would be realized by a shift to a state of higher carrying capacity of the environment (K) for aquatic populations and communities. However, it has not been possible to demonstrate unequivocally rising K as a result of AR deployment because of the difficulty in disentangling enhancements due to simple distributional changes (the attraction hypothesis) versus total abundance rise (the production hypothesis). Here we develop a modelling framework based on simple, inexpensive fisheries data to quantify the impact of ARs, disentangling attraction from production by assessing the rise in regional K. The rationale is that if attraction to ARs from the wider region was the main driver of increased abundance in the ARs then regional K would have remained constant before, during and after deployment of the ARs. Therefore an increase in regional K disproves the hypothesis of attraction. The study case is the fishery for the two-banded seabream Diplodus vulgaris in southern Portugal. Monthly time series of 27 years of landings, 20 years of fishing effort, were available from three small-scale fleets: one was the artisanal fleet operating on the ARs and the other two were semi-industrial fleets operating on the wider continental shelf. The model that we developed and applied incorporated the data from all fleets so it evaluated the change in regional K. We show that regional K for D. vulgaris increased by 35% after final deployment of the ARs and it did so in linear fashion during four years. From a fisheries perspective the result was more nuanced because although the deployment succeeded in raising regional K, stock biomass and thereby enhancing the artisanal fishery, it also led to a substantial rise in total fishing mortality and exploitation rate because the semi-industrial fleets operating offshore increased their harvest rate nearly 3-fold. Our modelling framework has wide applicability in other regions due to the elementary nature of the necessary fishing monitoring data.",,,,,,,,,31,0,0,0,19,0,33,,,0304-3800,1872-7026,,,,,,,,,,"King Fahd Univ Petr & Minerals, Ctr Environm & Water, Dhahran 31261, Saudi ArabiaInst Portugues Mar & Atmosfera, Avda 5 Outubro S-N, P-8700305 Olhao, PortugalUniv Algarve, Ctr Ciencias Mar, Campus Gambelas, P-8005139 Faro, Portugal",,,,2019-09-01,WOS:000482521300009,,,,,

Comprehensive studies have been carried out during the last 20 years in order to detect and document the weld defects as well as to understand their origin and effect on the fatigue strength of welds. Analogous efforts have been dedicated to understand and document the influence of local weld geometries on the stress concentrations and its influence on endurance and structural integrity.Similarly, efforts have been done to understand the influence of the relaxation by external loads of the by the ultrasonic peening treatment induced compressive stresses.Fatigue test results of ultrasonic peening treated relevant weld details have been used to assess the potential life extension.

New techniques that employ radar to activate deterrents only when birds are approaching a spill offer the potential to deter birds with greater and lasting efficacy. We summarize the findings of three recent studies of radar-activated bird deterrents at contaminated inland ponds and develop hypothetical scenarios for implementing such a system at marine oil spills. In open-water areas and inaccessible coastlines, boats may act as platforms for both radar and cannon deterrents. In coastal areas, networks of land-based radar and floating cannon platforms could be used. We discuss the importance of coupling knowledge on bird distributions and spill risk for effective planning and implementation of deterrents in oil spill response and then address some limitations of the radar-based system for oil spill responses.

A 1.8 km route was surveyed three times per week during a 12-month period. Deaths were tested against null hypotheses that season, taxonomy, and building attributes had no significant relationship with avian mortality.

Deaths occurred non-randomly by week, month, and migratory status with 90 percent of deaths occurring during spring and fall migrations.

Synergies arise when the abiotic and biotic factors controlling invasion success are themselves influenced by anthropogenic activities, such as those associated with coastal urbanization and industrialization.

High priority management actions include: 1) the removal, or containment, of legacy contaminants and reduction of new inputs to reduce the competitive advantage that some invaders have in contaminated environments, 2) the redesign of artificial structures to reduce colonization by NIS through eco-engineering, selection of construction materials and the 'seeding' of structures with native species to provide a priority advantage, 3) the management of dominant regional transport pathways to ensure that the risk of transporting NIS via our increasingly complex transport networks is minimized and 4) the protection and maintenance of biotic resilience in the form of intact living habitats and endemic diversity.

This research uses the Acadian dykelands of Nova Scotia, Canada, as an opportunity to explore the social and governance limits to coastal climate adaptation in 'new world' cultural agricultural landscapes, as well as inform local decision-making. Approximately half of Nova Scotia's coastal wetlands were converted to dykeland in the 1600s, lowering local resilience to the increased frequency and storm severity anticipated with climate change. Today, dykelands protect a diversity of public and private interests, meanings and values, yet are controlled by the agricultural sector, which can no longer afford to maintain them all to 2050 climate projections. We report here on a representative online Q-methodology survey of 183 adult Nova Scotians in the spring of 2015. Respondents sorted 34 statements along a normal distribution about whether they prefer dykeland maintenance or wetland restoration, and under what governance arrangements. Four factors were derived: the dominant discourse was local, female and strongly pro-dykeland, indicating the likelihood for local resistance to dykeland removal on for cultural, recreational and farming reasons. The second factor was supportive of wetland restoration for reasons of efficiency, not wetland affinity, but characterized by those in positions of management power. The two minority viewpoints were less informed about dykelands, characteristic of outsiders, and concerned more with governance. More education is needed about the challenges facing dykelands, the benefits of coastal wetlands, and the management options, but this research shows proposals to change landscape should emphasize flood mitigation over cost-saving. Cultural values and status quo bias are clearly barriers to adaptation planning, even when discussing the removal of man-made structures. The factors were surprisingly polarized, suggesting the forced-normal distribution affects the space available to convey nuanced perspectives.

The objectives of this study were to: (1) describe the colonisation process; (2) assess the role of the artificial reefs in terms of juvenile recruitment and growth and as mating/spawning areas and (3) evaluate the potential of artificial reefs as near shore artisanal fishing grounds for three economically important fish species, Diplodus bellottii (Steindachner), Diplodus sargus (L.) and Diplodus vulgaris (Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire). The fish assemblages were monitored after the deployment of a large artificial reef (Faro/Ancao) in 2002. Colonisation rates for the three species were fast. Artificial reefs play a multiple role for Diplodus spp., acting as recruitment, growth and nursery areas for juveniles, and spawning/mating areas for adults, and can thus be considered essential fish habitat. Three months after deployment of the artificial reefs, exploitable biomass was 16, 29 and 8 kg per reef group, respectively, for D. bellotti, D. sargus and D. vulgaris. These results indicate that artificial reefs quickly become good fishing grounds, where suitable financial yields may be obtained by fisher. Moreover, the artificial reefs became new and alternative fishing grounds, allowing reduction of fishing effort over traditional rocky areas that are scarce along the Algarve coast. Management measures for artificial reefs, in terms of fishing strategies, are discussed.",,,,,,,,,39,1,0,0,34,3,41,,,0969-997X,1365-2400,,,,,,,,,,"L IPIMAR, INRB, Olhao, PortugalUniv Algarve, Faro, Portugal",L IPIMAR,,,2009-04-01,WOS:000263966100002,,,,,

VLFS are extra large in size and mostly extra long in span and for that reason they are mostly modularized into several smaller structures and integrated. VLFSs may be classified into two broad categories, namely the semi-submersible type and the pontoon-type. The former type of VLFSs having their platform raised above the sea level and supported by columns resting on submerged pontoons and can minimize the effects of wave actions. In open sea, where the wave heights are relatively large, the semi-submersible VLFSs are preferred. On the other hand, the pontoon-type VLFS is a simple flat box structure floating on the sea surface. It is very flexible compared to other kinds of offshore structures, and so its elastic deformations are more important than their rigid body motions. The critical problem is the longitudinal bending moment of the long floating vessel in waves/current environment. Most of the present available VLFS designs are not economical for applications in hostile ocean. This paper presents hydrodynamic analysis carried out on an innovative VLFS called truss pontoon Mobile Offshore Base (MOB) platform concept proposed by Srinivasan [1]. The concept uses a strong deck with strong longitudinal beams to take care of the needed bending moment of the vessel for the survival, standby and operational conditions of the wave. At the submerged bottom just above the keel-tank top, a simple open-frame truss-structure is used instead of a heavy shell type pontoon. Thus the truss-pontoon provides the necessary flow transparency for the reduction of the wave exciting forces and consequently the heave motions and the vertical acceleration. Numerical analysis of truss pontoon MOB platform is carried out using HYDroelastic Response ANalysis (HYDRAN). Responses of the isolated scaled module in waves are obtained from these numerical tools and compared with published literature. Unconnected two modules and three modules are analysed using HYDRAN and the responses are compared with the isolated module. The proposed concept yielded lesser responses as compared to semisubmersible conventional MOB platform.",,,,,"35th ASME International Conference on Ocean, Offshore and Arctic Engineering35th ASME International Conference on Ocean, Offshore and Arctic Engineering","JUN 19-24, 2016JUN 19-24, 2016","ASME, Ocean Offshore & Arctic Engn DivASME, Ocean Offshore & Arctic Engn Div","Busan, SOUTH KOREABusan, SOUTH KOREA",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,978-0-7918-4992-7,,,,,,,,,"Indian Inst Technol Madras, Madras, Tamil Nadu, IndiaDeep Water Struct Inc, Houston, TX USA",Deep Water Struct Inc,,,2017-03-01,WOS:000393090000032,,,,,

With ambitious renewable energy targets, pile driving associated with offshore wind farm construction will become widespread in the marine environment. Many proposed wind farms overlap with the distribution of seals, and sound from pile driving has the potential to cause auditory damage. 2. We report on a behavioural study during the construction of a wind farm using data from GPS/GSM tags on 24 harbour seals Phoca vitulina L. Pile driving data and acoustic propagation models, together with seal movement and dive data, allowed the prediction of auditory damage in each seal. 3. Growth and recovery functions for auditory damage were combined to predict temporary auditory threshold shifts in each seal. Further, M-weighted cumulative sound exposure levels [cSELs(Mpw)] were calculated and compared to permanent auditory threshold shift exposure criteria for pinnipeds in water exposed to pulsed sounds. 4. The closest distance of each seal to pile driving varied from 4·7 to 40·5 km, and predicted maximum cSELs(Mpw) ranged from 170·7 to 195·3 dB re 1muPa2-s for individual seals. Comparison to exposure criteria suggests that half of the seals exceeded estimated permanent auditory damage thresholds. 5. Prediction of auditory damage in marine mammals is a rapidly evolving field and has a number of key uncertainties associated with it. These include how sound propagates in shallow water environments and the effects of pulsed sounds on seal hearing; as such, our predictions should be viewed in this context. 6. Policy implications. We predicted that half of the tagged seals received sound levels from pile driving that exceeded auditory damage thresholds for pinnipeds. These results have implications for offshore industry and will be important for policymakers developing guidance for pile driving. Developing engineering solutions to reduce sound levels at source or methods to deter animals from damage risk zones, or changing temporal patterns of piling could potentially reduce auditory damage risk. Future work should focus on validating these predictions by collecting auditory threshold information pre- and post-exposure to pile driving. Ultimately, information on population-level impacts of exposure to pile driving is required to ensure that offshore industry is developed in an environmentally sustainable manner. pv42_data Copyright: CC0 1.0 Universal (CC0 1.0) Public Domain Dedication",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2016-05-20,DRCI:DATA2016104008968211,,,,,

We examined the diets of adult black sea bass collected from two artificial reefs off New Jersey during August-October 1993 to assess the importance of reef epifauna to the predator. One reef was mature and colonized by an epifauna typical for this habitat in the area. The other reef, 20 km away and in a similar environment, was new and uncolonized by this epifauna. There was no significant difference between reefs in black sea bass diets, which were dominated by early benthic instar, juvenile rock crabs Cancer irroratus. Most of the prey, including the rock crabs, were not specifically associated with the reefs or can be equally common off the reefs. These results and those from similar studies indicate that black sea bass use reefs for shelter but may not depend on the reef-specific epifauna for food. Thus, the availability of nonreef forage can be important when artificial reefs and special fishery management zones or refuges are planned to support black sea bass and other reef species with similar diets.",,,,,,,,,23,1,0,0,20,0,33,,,0275-5947,,,,,,,,,,,"Natl.

The efficacy of this strategy depends on the extent to which artificial reefs contribute to new production or simply redistribute fish during or after settlement. Small coral reef fishes are ideal study subjects because redistribution is most likely during the larval stage, given limited dispersal of benthic stages. We develop a model that incorporates the simultaneous effects of habitat augmentation, competition among reefs for larval settlers, and post-settlement density-dependence, and propose two experimental approaches for evaluating the effects of artificial reefs on local production of natural reefs. One is based on small-scale studies using replicated patch reefs, the other on unreplicated studies using larger reefs and the Before-After-Control-Impact Paired Series (BACIPS) design. Using field data for six fish species, we estimated spatial and temporal variance and thus statistical power of both designs. Power varied among species, but in most cases was sufficiently high to detect local reductions in density of 10-40% with modest levels of replication (6-20 patch reefs or sampling dates).(C) 2002 International Council for the Exploration of the Sea.

However, uncertainties remain regarding the behavior and the performance of the keying flap. This paper presents a series of numerical analyses performed to investigate the flap rotation mechanism and the condition of activation of the flap.

A decade after their deployment, the same ARs were re-examined using experimental fishing and visual censuses. Results from our study demonstrated that the Balearic ARs have not increased the risk of overfishing because fishing effort on them is moderate, trammel net efficiency on ARs is low, there are high immigration rates to the ARs, and there are natural areas with a medium-high seabed relief that hold reserve stocks that are larger than those found on the ARs. Likewise, we found that the overall condition of the ecosystem is more important for the characterization of the composition and yield of AR catches than are the eutrophic-oligotrophic conditions of the surrounding water masses. We note that the function of the aggregation/production ARs is only analogous to that of marine protected areas (MPAs) and that ARs therefore should always be managed to ensure the correct use of marine resources.

However, it is generally difficult to study such an effect while controlling for other specific components of habitat structure. Here, temperate fish assemblages were studied in artificial reefs in localities differing chiefly in connectivity among complex habitat patches. Total fish abundance and biomass were higher in localities with high habitat connectivity, while species evenness followed the opposite trend. In most cases, the assemblages can also be distinguished by composition and relative abundance of species, as well as multispecies variability. Species responses were related to specific ecological profiles. Small species and those with restricted mobility were associated with high habitat connectivity. By contrast, medium-sized, off-reef foragers and vagile species were associated with reef isolation. The abundance ratio between 2 representative families of both groups of species, labrids and sparids, confirmed this finding. The temporal consistency of the observed patterns was also studied. The assemblages differed between periods of the year in terms of species composition and relative abundances. Total fish abundance, number of species and evenness were higher during the cold period than the warm, due to the presence of transient species.

A nearby assemblage of US Marine floating bridge boxes (Caissons) sunk during WWII and a natural fringing reef (Ricaudy) were surveyed at the same time. Species richness on the Caledonie Toho 2 increased to reach 42 species 398 days after scuttling. Fish density increased for 109 days after scuttling to reach a mean of 8.15 fish/m2, with exceptional peaks during recruitment phases. Fish biomass increased in two steps to reach an average of 336 g/m2 193 days after scuttling. The number of common species was higher between the Caledonie Toho 2 and the Caissons (54 species) than Caledonie Toho 2 and Ricaudy (20 species). Ricaudy fish assemblages were characterized by species associated with live corals whereas the artificial reefs were characterized by pelagic and opportunist species. Differences occurred between the Caledonie Toho 2 assemblage, characterized by numerous sciophylous species (Apogonidae), and the Caissons assemblage, characterized by large carnivorous species (Serranidae, Lutjanidae). These differences were due to the different size, shape and age of the two artificial reefs. The Caledonie Toho 2 assemblage evolved from a pioneer to a secondary assemblage, with four species assemblages being successively identified. The first step of the colonization was the arrival of large fish from the Caissons and the recruitment of Chromis fumea (Pomacentridae). The other species assemblages were characterized by seasonal recruitment of juveniles and migration of pelagic and opportunist adult fish species. The secondary assemblage was characterized by an increasing migration of adults of specialized benthic species despite the persistence of a pool of pelagic and opportunist species. Consequently, the Caledonie Toho 2 acted more as an attraction device located on bare sand than a productive structure for the surrounding environment during the first 13 months after the scuttling.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,0077-5630,,,,,,,,,,,"LERVEM, University of New Caledonia, BP 4477, Noumea, South Pacific, 98847, New Caledonia",,,,2001-06-01,ZOOREC:ZOOR13800004774,,,,,

This method can be routinely employed in a remotely operated vehicle, which enables a large number of members to be inspected fairly quickly at a much reduced cost compared to using diver operated techniques. However, reliance on FMD for safety assurance requires that welded joints retain sufficient fatigue life and static strength after through-thickness cracking.A comprehensive examination of published work containing data on fatigue lives beyond through-thickness cracking in offshore structures was carried out, resulting in the development of a database of 281 relevant tests. The database was used to perform a statistical assessment of the effects of different testing conditions and geometrical parameters on the remaining fatigue life beyond the occurrence of through-thickness cracking, N(3), which was represented by a parameter Re. Whilst the data showed a large amount of scatter, it was found that Re depends strongly on chord thickness, loading mode, type of joint and testing environment. In some cases, a significant amount of remaining life existed. This was often associated with T-type tubular joints with thin chord thickness under out-of-plane loading and a seawater (with CP) environment. The influence of the relevant parameters on Re is discussed and attributed to their effect on crack shape, stress distribution, cracking location and crack propagation path.",,,,,27th International Conference on Offshore Mechanics and Arctic Engineering27th International Conference on Offshore Mechanics and Arctic Engineering,"JUN 15-20, 2008JUN 15-20, 2008","ASME, Ocean, Offshore, & Arct Engn DivASME, Ocean, Offshore, & Arct Engn Div","Estoril, PORTUGALEstoril, PORTUGAL",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,978-0-7918-4822-7,,,,,,,,,"TWI Ltd, Cambridge, England",,,,2008-01-01,WOS:000263581100029,,,,,

Sandeels were collected using a modified scallop dredge and sediment samples using a van Veen grab. The results from an analysis on all species combined revealed a positive short-term effect on the densities of both juveniles and adults, which was consistent with a reduction in the fraction of silt+clay. In the long term, a negative effect on juveniles was found; however, this effect was neither consistent with the additional survey in 2009 nor the silt+clay fraction.

Applying a multidisciplinary and functional, holistic approach is essential to maintain a healthy natural system. Scientists and managers are searching for measures to adapt the ecosystem in such a way that flood risk is decreased, harbour activities can further develop and nature is conserved. This literature review (including 286 publications) gives an overview of a broad range of management measures that are, or can be, applied for estuarine management, including measures to change hydrology, morphology, habitat, and water and sediment quality. Furthermore, the differences between the different management measures regarding its impact on ecosystem services and biodiversity are identified to detect which management measures can contribute to specific estuarine targets. By looking for trade-offs and synergies, opportunities to reduce management costs and increase benefits to society are revealed. This can help to develop an integrated management strategy among the many management departments and with respect to both ecological and socio-economic needs. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Despite extensive literature describing the strong association between artificial structures and invasive species, little effort has been directed towards identifying the larval traits that favor this selection. Larval selection and settlement are crucial as larvae actively search and interpret environmental cues to identify suitable habitats to settle. The aim of this research was to investigate if invertebrate larvae have a preference for a particular anthropogenic substrate, and how pre-settlement behaviors vary when encountering different substrates. We used two invasive bryozoan species, Bugula flabellata and Bugula neritina, which are commonly found in urbanized areas around the world. Energy expenditure during planktonic and benthonic stages, pre-settlement swimming/exploring behaviors, settlement and larval selectivity were quantified under laboratory conditions on different substrates (concrete, wood, polystyrene, polyvinyl chloride, polyethylene terephthalate and polycarbonate). The energy expenditure measured was higher in planktonic larvae than in early settled larvae. Larvae of both species swam less and explored more when exposed to plastic surfaces, suggesting a preference for this substrate and resulting in lower energy expenditures associated with searching for habitat. Larvae actively chose to settle on plastics rather than on wood or concrete substrates. The results suggest that for Bugula larvae, the likelihood of colonizing plastic surfaces is higher than other materials commonly found in urbanized coastal areas. The more quickly they adhere to artificial substrates the lower the energy expenditure, contributing to higher fitness in these individuals. The strong preference of invertebrate larvae for plastics can potentially extend the distribution range of many invasive marine species as they are able to travel long distances attached to floating debris. This phenomenon will likely exacerbate the introduction of exotic species into novel habitats. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Although the NIMBY (Not In My Back Yard) concept is commonly used to explain public opposition, the concept has been extensively critiqued. This study applies an alternative approach based upon the notion of disruption to place attachment, and the theory of social representations, with a focus upon the symbolic meanings associated with a proposed project and the places affected by it. Empirical data is provided from a case study of a proposed 750 MW offshore wind farm in North Wales, using group discussions and questionnaires distributed to local residents in two coastal towns (n = 488). Results indicate significant differences between each town's residents in their responses to the project, and how opposition arises from nature/industry symbolic contradictions: between a place represented in terms of scenic beauty that provides a restorative environment for residents and visitors, and a wind farm that will industrialise the area and 'fence' in the bay. In one of the towns, the data suggests that contradiction between project and place was experienced as a threat to identity for those with strong place attachment, leading to negative attitudes and oppositional behaviour. Levels of trust in key actors moderated the relation between place attachment and negative attitudes to the wind farm. The results provide further evidence of the role of place attachment in shaping so-called 'NIMBY' responses to development proposals, and challenge the assumption that offshore wind farms will prove less controversial than those onshore.

SERPENT video observations include the deepest known records of species previously considered epipelagic such as scalloped hammerhead (Sphyrna lewini) and southern sunfish (Mola ramsayi) and the first in situ observations of pelagic species such as oarfish (Regalecus glesne). Such observations enable improvements to distribution records and description of behaviour of poorly understood species. Specimen collection has been used for taxonomic descriptions, functional studies and natural products chemistry research. Anthropogenic effects been assessed at the local scale using in situ observations and sample collection at the time of drilling operations and subsequent visits have enabled study of recovery from drilling.Future challenges to be addressed using the SERPENT approach include ensuring unique faunal observations by industry ROV operators are reported, further study of recovery from deep-water drilling activity and to carry out in situ studies to improve the understanding of potential future decommissioning of obsolete hydrocarbon infrastructure.

J,Anonymous,,,,,,,,,,Developing a Habitat Loss Method for Assessing Displacement Impacts from Offshore Wind Farms.,,,,,,,,JNCC Report,,,,551,,,,i,"vi, 1-51",,,,,,,,,,,Article,Mar 2015,2015,"The impacts of offshore wind farms (OWFs) on seabirds are typically divided into three forms: collision mortality, barrier impacts and displacement impacts. This report investigates the validity of assumptions underlying a recently suggested approach, defined as the 'Displacement as Habitat Loss' approach. This approach interprets displacement impacts as a time restricted, quasi-permanent habitat loss rather than a year-on-year effect across the entire operational lifetime of an OWF. It proposes that after displacement impacts have been exerted on a population, a new, stable population equilibrium is reached at some level below the initial starting population. By examining the assumptions underlying this approach and outlining ways of translating it into a staged assessment framework, this report provides an analysis of the pros and cons of the 'Displacement as Habitat Loss' approach. An assessment framework has been developed that is presented, discussed and applied in case studies for two species. Additionally, alternative ways of developing a staged framework to the 'Displacement as Habitat Loss' approach are considered. It has been found that, independent of the focus of any assessment framework, challenges relating to the understanding and assessment of ecological processes governing the strength of any potential displacement effect, will affect the delivery of any potential assessment framework. Estimating (by season) the size of the original habitat, the habitat remaining after displacement impacts have occurred, and the likely number of birds that may need to relocate to alternative (remaining) habitat, appears possible but is challenging in its own right. Available evidence on percentage displacement suggests strong site-specific variations. For assessments the use of generic displacement categories for species (uch as high, medium or low sensitivity) may be best, unless variations can be explained by, for example, habitat quality, which could represent a factor governing the strength of any sitespecific displacement effect. Considerable evidence gaps as well as difficulties with quantitatively assessing those ecological processes, which are subject to considerable natural variability, impede the assessment of the biological consequences of displacement. Quantification of the likely fitness implications of displacement requires a detailed understanding of the degree to which local populations are below, at, or above carrying capacity. This appears to be a precondition of any attempt to estimate what proportion of displaced birds are forced to relocate to alternative habitat and the proportion of those that might be accommodated within remaining habitat without considerable energetic costs. Moreover, if population equilibrium exists in seabird populations, it may not be possible to reliably characterise the point at which this equilibrium has been reached, due to the strong fluctuations that are inherent in marine ecosystems. Population equilibrium is unlikely to be constant and thus separating displacement effects from natural population fluctuations, as well as other pressures on the population being assessed, may be impossible. A clear benefit of a staged assessment framework is that it provides transparency on where assumptions are made in the process and at which stage they are introduced. This is an advantage over the existing 'Displacement Matrix' approach as it helps breakdown the particular areas of uncertainty needing further research. The 'Displacement as Habitat Loss' framework, particularly in later stages, requires empirical evidence on seabird species that are absent from the literature. Each stage has particular uncertainties associated with it, meaning that cumulatively an unacceptable level of uncertainty can be the result. The 'Displacement as Habitat Loss' approach provides a thorough theoretical framework to assess displacement impacts from OWFs. However, the absence of empirical evidence to support/refute various the assumptions required throughout mean that in practice the framework is currently unlikely to be applied in a 'real-world' scenario, until some of the uncertainties have been further explored.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,0963-8091,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2015-10-29,ZOOREC:ZOOR15111070166,,,,,

The distribution of the UK fleet of large ( > 15 m length). fishing vessels was analysed and clear gear-specific temporal and spatial differences in activity were found. Mobile demersal gears had the highest intensity and widest distribution of activity in the study area, and so might be expected to have the most widespread ecosystem-level impacts. The potential effects of two proposed fisheries closures; a planned wave energy testing facility (Wave Hub) and a candidate offshore Marine Protected Area (Haig Fras) are described. Maps indicate that mobile demersal gear fleets would be little affected if they were excluded from these proposed closures, but if the static gear fleets were excluded this would likely result in displacement of certain vessels, increasing fishing pressure on other rocky grounds and other fishers. Predictions concerning the effects of fisheries displacement can be improved through the use of high-resolution gear-specific activity data.

To analyze the economic feasibility of offshore wind farms, harvestable energy was calculated using an InVEST (Integrated Valuation of Environmental Services and Tradeoffs) model that has been used widely for marine ecosystem service analysis. Capital costs for grid connection and electricity transmission, operation and maintenance costs, and other costs were integrated together to calculate a net present value (NPV) of a 60-MW offshore wind farm assuming a lifetime of 20 years of operation. It is important to note that NPVs of offshore wind farms are affected significantly by the proximity to the closest inland substations, showing the importance of grid connection. Criteria that may cause social and environmental conflicts were grouped into three categories: nature conservation and landscape protection, marine-based human activities, and marine environment and marine ecosystem. Available datasets for each category were compiled and incorporated into GIS-based maps. Many social and environmental criteria overlapped spatially, and areas influenced by one or more criteria were designated as areas of potential conflicts. Economic analysis results and potential social and environmental conflicts were considered together to select areas that could produce wind energy more efficiently with minimum social and environmental conflicts. Economic, social, and environmental assessment strategies and, procedures provided in this study can be used as an effective decision-making support tool to find sites for offshore wind farm development and various other offshore developments as well.

Through conventional and more innovative methodologies (respectively single beam echo sounders and global positioning system) the research work has resulted in a new evaluation of the morphological, bathymetric and sedimentological features that make up this shoreline and its volumetrical change over the century. The survey and the research carried out on the studied area have enabled us to give a more detailed picture of the evolution of the littoral, to assess the possible use of non-traditional techniques of beach development monitoring, to evaluate the volumetric variations of the emerged and submerged beaches, to establish the sedimentological activity of the beach after the latest nourishment measures, and finally, to verify the effectiveness of the protection measures implemented on this coastline. The acquired data have been stored in the database and a geographic information system has been used to process, analyze, and evaluate the results. The main findings show that the latest intervention has brought about a new phase in the evolution of the coastline, giving rise to a new pseudo-balanced condition. The re-distribution of materials used for the beach nourishment, leads us to believe that the defence underwater barrier has only partially worked.

In this sense, the offshore renewable energy sector has experienced major growth rates. In Portugal, new projects on fixed foundations have now started to arise, as the EDP's full scale demonstration GBF wind turbine, DEMOGRAVI3 project. Innovative concepts as the XL monopiles are also considered as viable alternatives. ORACLE contributes towards a risk-based decision framework to assess the feasibility of fixed foundations for offshore wind turbines and the implications of the foundation's design in the investment needed for commercial scale projects, in the Portuguese renewable energy sector.The global industry and scientific community is aiming at new ambitious goals and trends, towards the minimization of risks and costs, in a context of long-term useful life cycles, i.e. lifetime extension. The lifetime extension increases the potential incoming of renewable power, contributing to the financial viability of the total investment.The foundations have a considerable impact in the safety levels and costs. Because of the severe offshore environment, scour phenomena occurs and is a major source of design uncertainty and cause of foundation's collapse. ORACLE's main goal is to provide a Decision Support System to perform risk analysis and to optimise scour protections, in the context of lifetime extension and climate change effects.ORACLE acts on three strategic contributions:i)","Physical modelling validation of novel concepts for scour protections, i.e. dynamic top layers and wide-graded single layer;ii)",risk-based design methodology for offshore scour protections;iii),"implementation of an open access decision support system to perform risk analysis of the foundation and the scour protection.The risk analysis decision support system aims to set the basis for cost and risk reduction in the offshore wind turbines. Moreover, it will provide an estimate of the optimisation's impact in the Levelized Cost of Energy (LCoE). This project is developed for two lifetime extension scenarios, also framed within the importance of climate changes to extreme events in marine environment.- Risk analysis of new foundations designed for a large life cycle;- Risk analysis of existing foundations, considered for full or partial repowering.ORACLE project combines expertise in offshore, ocean and coastal engineering, developing innovative research in close contact with recognised consultants of the sector to ensure that the scientific results match the market's needs.The open access perspective of ORACLE, with a world-wide dissemination of a user-friendly decision support system, developed for researchers, professionals and stakeholders, is a step forward to add value in a sector typically surrounded by confidential policies.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,PTDC/ECI-EGC/32170/2017,,,,,,,,Universidade do Porto,,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:15425666,,

The relative contribution of prey items was determined using percent composition by weight, percent composition by number, percent frequency. of occurrence, and index of relative importance (IRI). Results suggest that snapper are feeding on organisms not associated with reefs, such as mantis shrimp and portunid crabs. Diet changes seasonally, with crabs being most important (38% and 43% by IRI) in summer and fall, while mantis shrimp dominate in winter (42% IRI). Pelagic zooplankton was the greatest by percent weight in the diet in spring (60% IRI). Fish also contribute to each season, but they are not the principal prey items in any season (28% - 30% IRI).

However, little is known about the role artificial reefs play in the trophic dynamics of the species. To this end, the seasonal and size-specific diet of red snapper was examined through stomach content analysis of individuals collected from artificial reefs in the north-central Gulf of Mexico off Alabama between May 1999 and April 2000. Diet information was subsequently combined with data from the literature to obtain a first-order estimate of prey demand of the red snapper population on artificial reefs off Alabama. Results indicate both that diet varied with season and red snapper size and that the overall diet was comprised primarily of demersal crustaceans, fish, and pelagic zooplankton. Annual prey demand of the red snapper population on Alabama artificial reefs was estimated to be over 31 million kg. Red snapper derived most of their nutrition from sand/mud- and water column-associated organisms, not from organisms associated with reefs. Based on these results, and the results from other red snapper studies off Alabama, Alabama artificial reefs may be attracting, not producing red snapper.",,,,,Symposium on Fisheries Ecology of Gulf of Mexico Red SnapperSymposium on Fisheries Ecology of Gulf of Mexico Red Snapper,"FEB 10-12, 2006FEB 10-12, 2006","Sea Grant Louisiana; NOAA; Univ West Florida; Univ S Alabama; Louisiana State Univ, Coastal Fisheries InstSea Grant Louisiana; NOAA; Univ West Florida; Univ S Alabama; Louisiana State Univ, Coastal Fisheries Inst","San Antonio, TXSan Antonio, TX",34,0,0,0,32,0,59,,,0892-2284,,978-1-888569-97-1,,,,,,,,,"Florida Fish & Wildlife Conservat Commiss, Div Marine Fisheries Management, 620 S Meridian St, Tallahassee, FL 32399 USALouisiana State Univ, Coastal Fisheries Inst, Baton Rouge, LA 70803 USALouisiana State Univ, Sch Coast & Environm, Dept Oceanog & Coastal Sci, Baton Rouge, LA 70803 USA",,,,2007-01-01,WOS:000253386500006,,,,,

To investigate the molecular basis of coral resilience to the stressful environmental conditions usually associated with urban locations, we generated whole transcriptome expression profiles for 31 Pseudodiploria strigosa colonies from these locations and a nearby offshore reef. Differential expression analysis between urban corals and offshore corals revealed a suite of molecular mechanisms allowing urban corals to withstand the poor-quality waters. P. strigosa corals from the urban locations have higher expression of 1) transcripts that encode pattern recognition receptors allowing these corals to sense and detect food particles and pathogenic invaders, 2) digestive and degrading enzymes enabling urban corals to carry out heterotrophic feeding and to digest potential pathogens, 3) transcripts related to innate immunity, defense and cellular detoxification protecting pathogenic organisms and water pollution. Our data shows that the studied urban corals are well equipped to defend themselves against frequent high bacterial and plankton concentrations and that they might rely on heterotrophic feeding for supplemental nutrition to fight off the stressful conditions. In addition, we have found that urban corals exhibit higher expression of proteins that are components of coral oocytes (vitellogenins and lipovitellins), suggesting that these corals might be in better health to dedicate more resources towards reproductive processes. We have also determined the symbiont types hosted by P. strigosa using reads that mapped to the SSU rRNA symbiont genes. This analysis revealed that P. strigosa colonies from the urban sites predominantly host symbionts from the genus Durusdinium. In contrast, the offshore colonies of this coral species exclusively host symbionts from the genus Breviolum. This result corroborates the previous finding on the inshore corals relying on Durusdinium symbionts to survive in urbanized waters. While transcriptomics plasticity revealed phenotypic variability within the Miami P. strigosa population, we hope that this study will open opportunities for developing genetic markers to determine if the differences between urban and offshore corals are based on their genetics. Genotyping the urban coral communities will hopefully foster further research on using these coral genotypes in restoration activities.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2021-04-16,DRCI:DATA2021067021390936,,,,,

We conducted surveys of highly mobile fauna (fishes) on artificial habitats (reefs) on the south-eastern USA continental shelf to test whether, in comparison to natural reefs, artificial reefs enhance local abundance and biomass of fishes at their poleward range margins. Here, we show that while temperate fishes were more abundant on natural reefs, tropical, and subtropical fishes exhibited higher abundances and biomasses on deep (25-35 m) artificial reefs. Further analyses reveal that this effect depended on feeding guilds because planktivorous and piscivorous but not herbivorous fishes were more abundant on artificial reefs. This is potentially due to heightened prey availability on and structural complexity of artificial reefs.
