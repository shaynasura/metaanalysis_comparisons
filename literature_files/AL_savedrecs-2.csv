They are however shown to actively interact with the channel bathymetry and sediment transport generating a scour and deposition pattern similar to bridge pier. Symmetric, streamwise, aligned turbine installations have shown to introduce only local effects, yet complex configurations may trigger non-local morphodynamic instabilities. Experimental investigations, based on continuous spatio-temporal measurements of bed topography, explore a number of inflow conditions and siting strategies for axial-flow hydrokinetic turbine models. Results show that asymmetric turbine installations in a portion of the channel cross section may introduce weak non-local deformation of the mean bed topography and alter bedform migration velocities. Geomorphic effects become stronger with increasing shear stress and with rotors deployed up to half of the channel width, resulting in mean flow distortion within the channel cross section and inducing an alternating scour-deposition pattern resembling the signature of steady, forced fluvial bars. Non-local effects can be mitigated, narrowing the turbine array, or amplified, distributing turbines in a vane-like installation, leading to different estimates of energy production averaged at the power plant scale. A discussion on the key quantities governing geomorphic effects and the potential benefits of asymmetric turbine deployments is provided as a preliminary guideline towards the expansion of Marine Hydrokinetic energy in rivers.

The numerical results obtained have been validated with hot wire measurements in a wind tunnel. The description of the boundary layer over the airfoil provides an insight into the main noise generation mechanism, which is known to be the scattering of the vortical disturbances in the boundary layer into acoustic waves at the airfoil trailing edge. In the present case, 2D wave instabilities are observed in both suction and pressure sides, but these perturbations are diffused into a turbulent boundary layer prior to the airfoil trailing edge, so tonal noise components are not expected in the far-field noise propagation.

First, a powerful and flexible meta heuristic optimisation model is developed to solve this problem, where the simulation algorithms and objective can be altered without any change to the optimiser. Second, a practical valuation methodology is developed, where historic wind farm data can be used to identify strengths and weaknesses in any maintenance planning method and estimate financial return on investment from implementation.

The study was conducted from May to November 1992 in the Great Bay-Little Egg Harbor estuary (< 1-8 m sampling depth) and on the adjacent inner continental shelf in the vicinity of Beach Haven Ridge (8-16 m). During the study more larvae nearing settlement (postflexion) were captured in the estuary than in the ocean. Settlement occurred earlier in the estuary than in the ocean perhaps under the influence of earlier, seasonal warming of estuarine waters. There appeared to be two spatial patterns of settlement in the study area based on the dominant species (n = 17) represented by a sufficient number of individuals (n >= 25 individuals). There were species that primarily settle in the estuary, as represented by both estuarine residents (n 3) and transients (n = 4), and those that settle in both the estuary and the ocean (n = 10). However, there were no species whose larvae were present in the estuary yet settle in the ocean. The fact that many of the species settle in both the estuary and the ocean indicates an overlap between these habitats because, at least for some species, these habitats may function in the same way. Further resolution of fish settlement patterns, and its influence on recruitment will need to rely on synoptic comparisons between estuaries and the ocean over multiple years. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

The many millions of migrating birds that pass these man-made obstacles are protected by international obligations and the subject of public concerns. Yet some bird species are more sensitive to bird-wind turbine mortality than others. This study developed a simple and logical framework for ranking bird species with regard to their relative sensitivity to bird-wind turbine-collisions, and applied it to a data set comprising 38 avian migrant species at the Nysted offshore wind farm in Denmark. Two indicators were selected to characterize the sensitivity of each individual species: 1) relative abundance and 2) demographic sensitivity (elasticity of population growth rate to changes in adult survival). In the case-study from the Nysted offshore wind farm, birds of prey and waterbirds dominated the group of high priority species and only passerines showed a low risk of being impacted by the wind farm. Even where passerines might be present in very high numbers, they often represent insignificant segments of huge reference populations that, from a demographic point of view, are relatively insensitive to wind farm-related adult mortality. It will always be important to focus attention and direct the resources towards the most sensitive species to ensure cost-effective environmental assessments in the future, and in general, this novel index seems capable of identifying the species that are at high risk of being adversely affected by wind farms.

Along these lines, a multi-hazard environment was considered herein and the structural performance of a 5 MW offshore wind turbine was assessed through time domain analysis. A fully integrated model of the offshore structure consisting of the blades, the nacelle, the tower and the monopile was developed with the use of an aeroelastic code considering the interaction between the elastic and inertial forces, developed in the structure, as well as the generated aerodynamic and hydrodynamic forces. Based on the analysis results, the dynamic response of the turbines tower was found to be severely affected by the earthquake excitations. Moreover, fragility analysis based on acceleration capacity thresholds for the nacelles equipment corroborated that the earthquake excitations may adversely affect the reliability and availability of wind turbines.

Hence, renewable wind power systems are increasingly receiving the attention of mankind. Energy production with structurally more promising and economically more competitive design is no more the sole criterion while installing new megawatt (MW) range of turbines. Rather important life cycle analysis (LCA) issues like climate change, ozone layer depletion, effect on surrounding environments e.g. ecosystem quality, natural resources and human health emerge as dominant factors from green energy point of view. Hence, the study covers life cycle impact analysis (LCIA) of three wind farms: one onshore horizontal, one offshore horizontal, another vertical axis. It appears that vertical axis wind farm generates per unit electricity with lowest impact followed by horizontal offshore and horizontal onshore farms. The study, henceforward, discovers most adverse impact contributing materials in today's multi megawatt wind turbines and subsequently substitutes copper, the topmost impact contributor, with more eco-friendly aluminum alloys and its corresponding process routes. In this process, it reduces overall life cycle impacts up to 30% for future greener wind farms. In later stages, it compares all major electricity production technologies, viz., oil, diesel, coal, natural gas, wind, solar, biomass, nuclear, hydro plant in a common platform which demonstrates the wind farms performing the best except the hydro-kinetic ones. However, as the study suggests, offshore VAWT farm may even perform better than hydro-kinetic farms because of higher capacity factors in the high sea. Findings from the study can be deployed to harness massive scale green electricity from environmentally more clean and green turbines. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

As a consequence, each stability class considered still covers a wide range of conditions. In this paper, wind turbine fatigue loads are studied as a function of atmospheric stability without a classification system, and instead, atmospheric conditions are described by a continuous joint probability distribution of wind speed and stability. Simulated fatigue loads based upon this joint probability distribution have been compared with two distinct different cases, one in which seven stability classes are adopted and one neglecting atmospheric stability by following International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) standards. It is found that for the offshore site considered in this study, fatigue loads of the blade root, rotor and tower loads significantly increase if one follows the IEC standards (by up to 28% for the tower loads) and decrease if one considers several stability classes (by up to 13% for the tower loads). The substantial decrease found for the specific stability classes can be limited by considering one stability class that coincides with the mean stability of a given hub height wind speed. The difference in simulated fatigue loads by adopting distinct stability classes is primarily caused by neglecting strong unstable conditions for which relatively high fatigue loads occur. Combined, it is found that one has to carefully consider all stability conditions in wind turbine fatigue load simulations.

Numerical experiments with various turbine array configurations were carried out to investigate the changes in tidally averaged temperature, salinity, and velocity profiles in an idealized stratified estuary that connects to coastal water through a narrow tidal channel. The model was driven by tides, river inflow, and sea surface heat flux. To represent the realistic size of commercial tidal farms, model simulations were conducted based on a small percentage (less than 10 %) of the total number of turbines that would generate the maximum extractable energy in the system. Model results show that extraction of tidal in-stream energy will increase the vertical mixing and decrease the stratification in the estuary. Installation of in-stream tidal farm will cause a phase lag in tidal wave, which leads to large differences in tidal currents between baseline and tidal farm conditions. Extraction of tidal energy in an estuarine system has stronger impact on the tidally averaged salinity, temperature, and velocity in the surface layer than the bottom layer even though the turbine hub height is close to the bottom. Finally, model results also indicate that extraction of tidal energy weakens the two-layer estuarine circulation, especially during neap tides when tidal mixing is weakest and energy extraction is smallest.",,,,,,,,,15,0,0,0,3,0,15,,,1559-2723,1559-2731,,,,,,,,,,"Pacific NW Natl Lab, Seattle, WA 98109 USA",,,,2015-02-25,WOS:000347956700016,,

With excess generation the frequency will increase, and conversely, with a deficit of generation the frequency will fall. When either happens either all or a selection of plant must increase or decrease output automatically and rapidly to make up for the short fall or excess in power. This ancillary service is known as frequency response. Failure to do this correctly could result in system frequency exceeding permitted limits and automatic disconnection of customers, or in the worst case, system blackout. As the volume of wind turbine generation continues to increase exponentially, particularly in wind rich island countries such as Great Britain and Ireland, there comes a point where the synchronous generation must operate at reduced output or even be disconnected. Services which were once provided by this displaced synchronous generation must logically be taken up by other plant, with the obvious target being the replacement wind generation [2, 3]. Frequency response is one of these key services, particularly in smaller island networks with highly variable system frequency. Wind plant is ideally placed during windy days to provide a high frequency response service (reducing in output when frequency is high), with the remaining connected synchronous generation operating at low load to provide the required low frequency response. However, there are several factors which must be considered before wind plant can provide a robust, reliable and repeatable service to help in maintaining frequency stability in a grid. The major factors are discussed in this paper, together with presentation of a technique for providing frequency response from wind plant. This technique has been adopted by several wind turbine manufacturers, and has been, or is in the process of being implemented in a number of onshore and offshore wind farms in Great Britain.",,,,,,,,,2,1,0,0,0,0,3,,,0309-524X,2048-402X,,,,,,,,,,"DONG Energy, Grid Anal Team, Wind Power, London, EnglandDONG Energy, Generat & Asset Compliance Team, Natl Grid, London SW1X 7HY, England",,,,2012-06-01,WOS:000210790000007,,

One such resource is wind energy and while the onshore and fixed offshore wind energy industries are mature, the floating offshore wind energy industry is still at a demonstration phase. Floating wind turbine platforms are generally of a much smaller displacement than the typical offshore structures that have been used in the oil and gas industry. This difference results in changes to the platform dynamics, especially those resulting from second order wave forces. Existing research into low frequency drift motions of small body platforms has been mainly confined to numerical modelling with some experimental work. This work expands on this knowledge by validating numerical modelling with full scale observational data.In this paper, a numerical time-domain model of a relatively small displacement platform is developed. The platform is installed in a relatively shallow water depth of about 110 m and station keeping is provided by four equally spaced catenary mooring chains. The required fidelity for the low frequency response is compared using first order forces only and either a full QTF (quadratic transfer equation) or Newman's approximation. The model is compared with observation data from the Fukushima FORWARD project's floating substation, an advanced spar type, which is composed of measurements of multidirectional wave spectra, wind and current as model inputs and six DOF platform motions as outputs. In addition to this the model computational expense is reduced by decreasing the number of wave directions simulated. The accuracy of such reductions is then described. Observation data is grouped according to sea-state data. An empirical drag coefficient formula is proposed. The 50 year return period design sea-state is also modelled using a JONSWAP spectrum and the various numerical models.",,,,,"38th ASME International Conference on Ocean, Offshore and Arctic Engineering (OMAE 2019)38th ASME International Conference on Ocean, Offshore and Arctic Engineering (OMAE 2019)","JUN 09-14, 2019JUN 09-14, 2019","ASME, Ocean Offshore & Arctic Engn Div; Univ Strathclyde, Dept Naval Architecture Ocean & Marine EngnASME, Ocean Offshore & Arctic Engn Div; Univ Strathclyde, Dept Naval Architecture Ocean & Marine Engn","Univ Strathclyde, Glasgow, SCOTLANDUniv Strathclyde, Glasgow, SCOTLAND",3,0,0,0,0,0,3,,,2153-4772,,978-0-7918-5888-2,,,,,,,,,"Univ Tokyo, Tokyo, JapanJapan Marine United Corp, Yokohama, Kanagawa, Japan",Japan Marine United Corp,,,2020-03-02,WOS:000513309700053,,

The objectives were to assess the corresponding risk for aquatic primary producers and to provide exposure information for connected studies on the responses of biological parameters in invertebrate sentinel species. The risk associated with contaminants was assessed using risk quotients based on the comparison of measured concentrations with original species sensitivity distribution-derived hazardous concentration values. For EU Water Framework Directive priority substances, results of monitoring were also compared with regulatory Environmental Quality Standards. The highest residue concentrations and risks for primary producers were recorded for diuron and Irgarol 1051 in Arzal reservoir, close to a marina. Diuron was present during almost the all survey periods, whereas Irgarol 1051 exhibited a clear seasonal pattern, with highest concentrations recorded in June and July. These results suggest that the use of antifouling biocides is responsible for a major part of the contamination of the lower part of the Vilaine River course for Irgarol 1051. For diuron, agricultural sources may also be involved. The presence of isoproturon and chloroacetanilide herbicides on some dates indicated a significant contribution of the use of plant protection products in agriculture to the contamination of Vilaine River. Concentration levels and associated risk were always lower in estuarine sites than in the reservoir, suggesting that Arzal dam reduces downstream transfer of contaminants and favors their degradation in the freshwater part of the estuary. Results of the additional monitoring of two tidal streams located downstream of Arzal dam suggested that, although some compounds may be transferred to the estuary, their impact was probably very low. Dilution by marine water associated with tidal current was also a major factor of concentration reduction. It is concluded that the highest risks associated to herbicides and booster biocides concerned the freshwater part of the estuary and that its brackish/saltwater part was exposed to a moderate risk, although some substances may sometimes exhibit high concentration but mainly at low tide and on an irregular basis.",,,,,,,,,61,3,0,0,48,0,64,,,0944-1344,1614-7499,,,,,,,,,,"INRA, Ecol & Sante Ecosyst UMR985, Equipe Ecotoxicol & Qualite Milieux Aquat, F-35042 Rennes, FranceIRSTEA, UR REBX, F-33612 Cestas, FranceIFREMER, Unite Biogeochim & Ecotoxicol, F-44311 Nantes, FranceIFREMER, Lab Cotier Morbihan Pays Loire, F-56470 La Trinite Sur Mer, France",,,,2013-03-05,WOS:000314065100006,22983624,

The manufacturing of the blades model was executed in a machining center of three axes CNC, DYNA MYTE DM-4800. The final manufacture of composite materials was performed.The wind energy is an indirect form of the solar energy, since they are the temperature differences and the pressure-induced in the atmosphere by absorbing solar radiation, which set in motion the winds. The rotor mission in a wind turbine is transforming this kinetic energy of wind to mechanic energy. In this paper the design of the blades is based on the blade element moment theory. For the design and manufacturing CAD/CAM was developed a general methodology. In manufacturing of the blade was necessary to manufacture a false bed, which was used as a virtual axis, this is because the milling machine where this was manufactured only has three axes.The mechanical efficiency of a wind turbine depends on other factors airfoil blade, since the aerodynamic forces that occur in this provides the torque necessary for rotating the electric generator. In this sense, obtaining highly accurate airfoil geometries helps to improve the efficiency of the wind machine.Blades were manufactured of length 75.5 cm, for a 600 watts wind turbine power, the design parameters were based on the environmental conditions of the coast of Michoacan, Mexico. The machining of the blades model are made from wood by mechanical milling, which is a manufacturing process for metal removal performed by the motion of a rotating cutting tool called milling cutter.

In relatively recent times, the usage of wind turbines to generate electricity has gained momentum. This is partially due to environmental threats from fossil fuel usage. It has become essential to look for energy sources which are renewable and clean to eliminate or reduce the environmental pollution and lower economic costs. However, using wind turbines in traditionally low wind speed areas has proved to be economically prohibitive. To address this issue, ducted or shrouded wind turbines have been studied and developed throughout the twentieth century. When the shroud is designed optimally, a lift force is generated by the flow through the shroud, and the effect of this lift is to increase the mass flow rate through the rotor plane. This study compared two shroud designs; the established Widnall design and a new design shaped by revolving airfoil E423 (high lift force) about a center-line. Numerical and experimental simulations were conducted at lower wind speeds in order to compare the augmentation velocity factors of each design. The effect of various design parameters on the shroud performance, namely drag force, area ratio, angle of attack for the shrouds, cost effect, and shroud geometric influences were considered. The computational fluid dynamic techniques were conducted using commercially available software. Experimental investigations on a micro-shroud included measurement of the velocity distribution inside the shroud and determination of the extracted power in these shrouds by placing a small turbine at the throat region. A low speed wind tunnel was used for the experiments. Both of the shrouds (Widnall and E423) were modeled using readily available databases for each airfoil. The models were then manufactured with a 3D printer using PLA plastic material. Results obtained from numerical simulations showed that the velocity factor increased linearly with increasing area ratio and shroud length for both shrouds. Experimental investigations on an empty micro-shroud showed good agreement with the computational fluid dynamics velocity distribution and augmentation velocity factor at the throat area. Power output from the micro-turbine was experimentally determined for a no shroud system, a Widnall shroud system, and an E423 shroud system. Both shroud systems improved the micro-turbine performance. In all instances investigated, the E423 shroud outperformed the Widnall shroud.",,,,,ASME International Mechanical Engineering Congress and ExpositionASME International Mechanical Engineering Congress and Exposition,"NOV 03-09, 2017NOV 03-09, 2017",ASMEASME,"Tampa, FLTampa, FL",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,978-0-7918-5841-7,,,,,,,,,"Youngstown State Univ, Youngstown, OH 44555 USA",,,,2018-04-20,WOS:000428485500096,,

To explore highly efficient and robust damage detection methods for offshore wind turbine structures, three well-known modal strain energy indices are reviewed first and then a new index named total modal energy method is proposed. The innovation of the new index is the simultaneous use of modal strain energy and modal kinetic energy. To investigate the feasibility and robustness of the four modal-energy-based methods, numerical and experimental studies are conducted on a tripod-type offshore wind turbine structure with simulated and measured data. It is indicated that all the four modal-energy-based methods work well with limited incomplete modal data, especially for the single-damage cases. While for the cases of multiple damage locations, the new total modal energy index significantly outperforms the traditional modal strain energy indices. Moreover, high robustness is shown for the indices, when the measured mode shapes of undamaged and damaged structures are polluted with the same noise level. However, when their noise levels have some difference, two of the modal strain energy indices turn invalid, but the new total modal energy index still shows stronger robustness. As frequencies are also used in the total modal energy index, its robustness to the noise in modal frequencies is also studied. It is shown that the results are slightly affected by the measurement noise in modal frequencies. Besides, the influence of finite element modeling errors is also investigated with both simulated and experimental data. Results show that all the four modal-energy-based methods are all very stable and insensitive to certain modeling errors.

Due to the flexibility of their mooring systems, floating offshore wind turbines are susceptible to large oscillations such as aerodynamic force of the wind and hydrodynamic force of the wave, which may compromise their performance and structural stability. This paper focuses on the evaluation of aerodynamic forces depending on suppressing undesired turbine's motion by a rotor thrust control which is controlled by pitch changes with wind tunnel experiments. In this research, the aerodynamic forces of wind turbine are tested at two kinds of pitch control system: steady pitch control and cyclic pitch control. The rotational speed of rotor is controlled by a variable speed generator, which can be measured by the power coefficient. Moment and force acts on model wind turbine are examined by a six-component balance. From cyclic pitch testing, the direction and magnitude of moment can be arbitrarily controlled by cyclic pitch control. Moreover, the fluctuations of thrust coefficient can be controlled by collective pitch control. The results of this analysis will help resolve the fundamental design of suppressing undesired turbine's motion by cyclic pitch control. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

It is expected to significantly contribute to the further increase of renewable energy in the global energy production in the future. However, even with floating wind turbines, only a fraction of the global offshore wind energy potential can be harvested because grid-connection, moorings, installation and maintenance costs increase tremendously as the distance to shore and the water depth increase. Thus, new technologies enabling harvesting the far offshore wind energy resource are required. To tackle this challenge, mobile energy ship concepts have been proposed. In those concepts, electricity is produced by a water turbine attached underneath the hull of a ship propelled by the wind using sails. It includes an on-board energy storage system since energy ships are not grid-connected. Thus, the ships route schedules could be dynamically optimized taking into account weather forecast in order to maximize their capacity factors (CF). The aim of this study is to investigate how high the capacity factors of energy ships could be when using weather-routing and compare them to that of stationary wind turbines that would be deployed in the same areas. To that end, a modified version of the weather-routing software QtVlm was used. Velocity and power production polar plots of an energy ship that was designed at LHEEA were used as input to QtVlm.

Wind turbines have been erected in increasing numbers in Europe, the USA and elsewhere. In Europe, Germany and Denmark have played a particularly prominent part in developing the technology, and both countries have installed large numbers of turbines. This article is concerned with understanding the historic reliability of modem wind turbines. The prime objective of the work is to extract information from existing data so that the reliability of large wind turbines con be predicted, particularly when installed offshore in the future. The article uses data collected from the Windstats survey to analyse the reliability of wind turbine components from historic German and Danish data. Windstats data have characteristics common to practical reliability surveys; for example, the number of failures is collected for each interval but the number of turbines varies in each interval. In this article, the authors use reliability analysis methods which are not only applicable to wind turbines but relate to any repairable system. Particular care is taken to compare results from the two populations to consider the validity of the data. The main purpose of the article is to discuss the practical methods of predicting large-wind-turbine reliability using grouped survey data from Windstats and to show how turbine design, turbine configuration, time, weather and possibly maintenance con affect the extracted results.

The workshop Optimizing Lidar Design for Wind Energy Applications was held in July 2016 to identify lidar system properties that are desirable for wind turbine control applications and help foster the widespread application of lidar-assisted control (LAC). One of the main barriers this workshop aimed to address is the multidisciplinary nature of LAC. Since lidar suppliers, wind turbine manufacturers, and researchers typically focus on their own areas of expertise, it is possible that current lidar systems are not optimal for control purposes. This paper summarizes the results of the workshop, addressing both practical and theoretical aspects, beginning with a review of the literature on lidar optimization for control applications. Next, barriers to the use of lidar for wind turbine control are identified, such as availability and reliability concerns, followed by practical suggestions for mitigating those barriers. From a theoretical perspective, the optimization of lidar scan patterns by minimizing the error between the measurements and the rotor effective wind speed of interest is discussed. Frequency domain methods for directly calculating measurement error using a stochastic wind field model are reviewed and applied to the optimization of several continuous wave and pulsed Doppler lidar scan patterns based on commercially-available systems. An overview of the design process for a lidar-assisted pitch controller for rotor speed regulation highlights design choices that can impact the usefulness of lidar measurements beyond scan pattern optimization. Finally, using measurements from an optimized scan pattern, it is shown that the rotor speed regulation achieved after optimizing the lidar-assisted control scenario via time domain simulations matches the performance predicted by the theoretical frequency domain model.",,,,,,,,,39,0,0,0,0,0,40,,,,2072-4292,,,,,,,,,,"Envis Energy USA Ltd, 1201 Louisiana St,Suite 500, Houston, TX 77002 USAUniv Stuttgart, Stuttgart Wind Energy, Allmandring 5b, D-70569 Stuttgart, Germany",Envis Energy USA Ltd,,,2018-06-01,WOS:000436561800057,,

In contrast, off-shore viewshed experience increases preferences for wind power relative to biomass energy by 24%. However, the effect is dependent on the type of off-shore wind farm experience.

A 5-MW reference drivetrain is selected and modeled on a spar-type floating wind turbine in 320 m water depth. A range of environmental conditions are selected based on the long-term distribution of wind speed, significant wave height, and peak period from hindcast data for the Northern North Sea. For each condition, global analysis using an aero-hydro-servo-elastic tool is carried out for six one-hour realizations. The global analysis results provide useful information on their own-regarding the correlation between environmental condition and tower top acceleration, and the correlation between tower top acceleration and other responses of interest-which are used as input in a decoupled analysis approach. The load effects and motions from the global analysis are applied on a detailed drivetrain model in a multi-body system (MBS) analysis tool.

The design process should be carried out in a probabilistic way due to the uncertainties involved, such as using parametric uncertainties regarding material and geometric properties, and model uncertainties in resistance prediction models and regarding environmental loads. Traditional simple deterministic checking procedures do not guarantee an optimized design because the associated uncertainties are not fully considered.

The reliability analysis mainly considers the serviceability limit state of the structure according to the requirements of the code. The framework consists of two parts: (i) an important parameter identification procedure based on statistical correlation analysis and (ii) a finite element-simulation-based reliability estimation procedure. The procedure is demonstrated through a jacket structure design of a 3 MW OWT. The analysis results show that the statistical correlation analysis can help to identify the parameters necessary for the overall structural performance. The Latin hypercube sampling and the Monte Carlo simulation using FE models effectively and efficiently evaluate the reliability of the structure while not relying on a surrogate limit state function. A comparison between the proposed framework and the deterministic design shows that the framework can help to achieve a better result closer to the target reliability level.",,,,,,,,,10,0,0,0,0,0,11,,,1996-1073,,,,,,,,,,,"Harbin Engn Univ, Coll Aerosp & Civil Engn, Harbin 150001, Heilongjiang, Peoples R ChinaWestern Sydney Univ, Ctr Infrastruct Engn, Sydney, NSW 2751, AustraliaHarbin Engn Univ, Coll Shipbldg Engn, Harbin 150001, Heilongjiang, Peoples R ChinaOcean Univ China, Coll Engn, Qingdao 266100, Shandong, Peoples R China",,,,2019-08-26,WOS:000478999400111,,

Currently, the removal of grease from wind turbines offshore in the North Sea is done by dismantling the bearing covers and scraping off the grease. This procedure is long, labour intensive and raises maintenance cost. Another issue is the environmental policy, the approval for newly introduced chemicals for flushing purposes are procedurally long. If the problems with grease removal could be solved in a different way other than manual removal or using chemicals, it will open many new market opportunities and would carved out a niche for the wind turbine maintenance industry. The solution of flushing grease could lower cost, time and reduce environmental impact by applying Supercritical Carbon Dioxide. The oil based grease SKF LGWM 1 was designed to handle extreme pressure and low temperature conditions. The grease covered the main bearing for 4 - 5 y in a wind turbine at Horns Rev 1 Offshore Wind Farm in the North Sea, 14 km from the west coast of Denmark. The series of experiments focused on higher pressures and temperatures as well as the use of some co-solvents. The highest recovery by pure carbon dioxide is 26 % and was achieved at 60 MPa and 80 degrees C while the addition of Kirasol-318SC improved the recovery by 8 % at the same conditions. Outgassing losses increase with the addition of kirasol. The low recoveries and high pressures obtained by the experiment do not provide an applicable method for grease removal; however it can be implemented for the removal of the contaminants from grease wastes.",,,,,11th International Conference on Chemical and Process Engineering (ICheaP)11th International Conference on Chemical and Process Engineering (ICheaP),"JUN 02-05, 2013JUN 02-05, 2013",,"Milan, ITALYMilan, ITALY",2,0,0,0,0,0,2,,,2283-9216,,978-88-95608-23-5,,,,,,,,,"Aalborg Univ, Sect Chem Engn, Dept Biotechnol Chem & Environm Engn, DK-6700 Esbjerg, Denmark",,,,2014-06-18,WOS:000335952100319,,

This paper systematically reviews publicly available reliability data for both onshore and offshore WTs and investigates the impacts of reliability on the cost of energy. WT failure rates and downtimes, broken down by subassembly, are collated from 18 publicly available databases including over 18 000 WTs, corresponding to over 90 000 turbine-years. The data are classified based on the types of data collected (failure rate and stop rate) and by onshore and offshore populations. A comprehensive analysis is performed to investigate WT subassembly reliability data variations, identify critical subassemblies, compare onshore and offshore WT reliability, and understand possible sources of uncertainty. Large variations in both failure rates and downtimes are observed, and the skew in failure rate distribution implies that large databases with low failure rates, despite their diverse populations, are less uncertain than more targeted surveys, which are easily skewed by WT type failures. A model is presented to evaluate the levelised cost of energy as a function of WT failure rates and downtimes. A numerical study proves a strong and nonlinear relationship between WT reliability and operation and maintenance expenditure as well as annual energy production. Together with the cost analysis model, the findings can help WT operators identify the optimal degree of reliability improvement to minimise the levelised cost of energy.",,,,,,,,,118,1,0,0,0,0,122,,,1095-4244,1099-1824,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Durham, Dept Engn, Durham DH1 3LE, England",,,,2019-09-30,WOS:000485418300001,,

To improve mesoscale forecasts of wind, temperature, and dewpoint temperature in this layer, two different approaches are examined. In the first experiment, the vertical resolution of a limited-area model with 2.5-km grid spacing (LAM-2.5 km) is significantly increased near the surface to better represent profiles in that layer. In the second experiment, prognostic variables for land and ocean surfaces are initialized using results from an external land surface model system [the Global Environmental Multiscale Surface system (GEM-Surf)] and from a regional ocean model. Results show that increasing the vertical resolution near the surface leads to improved temperature and dewpoint temperature forecasts at the surface and in the wind turbine layer. For winds, improvements are more modest, because they are limited to the gradient measured across the span of the vertical wind turbine blades. On the other hand, the replacement of operational surface analyses with high-resolution analyses obtained from GEM-Surf is found to improve summer dewpoint temperature forecasts.

The experiment was run over two full-simulated tidal cycles. The scour hole formed tended to a symmetrical shape after two half-cycles and was both shallower and slower developing than the scour hole in a unidirectional current test carried out in the same flume. This was due mainly to the variable rates of scour caused by the variable flow conditions within each half-cycle, and to a lesser extent to the infilling of the scour hole when the current direction reversed.

Our results reveal that, since 2011, a growing number of wind turbines are being installed in forests, even if they only account for 5.5% of the total number (8% of the total installed wind power capacity) and are almost exclusively limited to six of the 16 federal states. As there are no nationwide, uniform regulations governing wind turbines in forested areas, the federal states developed their own specific regulations. While some, especially those with high forest shares, generally permit wind farms in forests for reaching their renewable energy targets, others aim to keep their forests clear. So far, planning law and regional planning could successfully steer the hitherto comparatively slow expansion of wind energy in forest areas and ensure that windmills in forests are by no means outlaws.",,,,,,,,,22,0,0,0,5,0,23,,,2214-6296,2214-6326,,,,,,,,,,"UFZ Helmholtz Ctr Environm Res, Dept Bioenergy, Permoserstr 15, D-04318 Leipzig, GermanyUFZ Helmholtz Ctr Environm Res, Dept Environm & Planning Law, Permoserstr 15, D-04318 Leipzig, GermanyDBFZ Deutsch Biomasseforschungszentrum, Dept Bioenergy Syst, Torgauer Str 116, D-04347 Leipzig, GermanyUniv Leipzig, Inst Infrastruct & Resources Management, Grimma Str 12, D-04109 Leipzig, Germany",DBFZ Deutsch Biomasseforschungszentrum,,,2019-08-13,WOS:000476872300002,,

The codes verified herein account for the coupled dynamic systems including the wind inflow, aerodynamics, elasticity and controls of the turbine, along with the incident waves, sea current, hydrodynamics and foundation dynamics of the support structure.A large set of time series simulation results such as turbine operational characteristics, external conditions, and load and displacement outputs was compared and interpreted. Load cases were defined and run with increasing complexity to trace back differences in simulation results to the underlying error sources. This led to a deeper understanding of the underlying physical systems. In four subsequent phasesdealing with a 5-MW turbine on a monopile with a fixed foundation, a monopile with a flexible foundation, a tripod and a floating spar buoythe latest support structure developments in the offshore wind energy industry are covered, and an adaptation of the codes to those developments was initiated.The comparisons, in general, agreed quite well. Differences existed among the predictions were traced back to differences in the model fidelity, aerodynamic implementation, hydrodynamic load discretization and numerical difficulties within the codes. The comparisons resulted in a more thorough understanding of the modeling techniques and better knowledge of when various approximations are not valid. More importantly, the lessons learned from this exercise have been used to further develop and improve the codes of the participants and increase the confidence in the codes' accuracy and the correctness of the results, hence improving the standard of offshore wind turbine modeling and simulation.One purpose of this paper is to summarize the lessons learned and present results that code developers can compare to. The set of benchmark load cases defined and simulated during the course of this projectthe raw data for this paperis available to the offshore wind turbine simulation community and is already being used for testing newly developed software tools. Despite that no measurements are included, the large number of participants and thein generalvery fine level of agreement indicate high trustworthy results within the physical assumptions of the codes and the simulation cases chosen. Other cases, such as large prebend flexible blades, large wind shear, large yaw error or transient maneuvers, may not show the same level of agreement. These cases were deliberately left out because the focus is on the specific offshore application.

The wind turbine, support structure and environmental conditions are represented by a large number of input parameters, whose uncertainties are accounted by applying partial safety factors. In this paper, the sensitivity of fatigue loads with respect to primary structural, geotechnical and metocean parameters are investigated for a 5 MW offshore wind turbine installed on a gravity based foundation. Linear regression of Monte Carlo simulations and Morris screening are performed for three design load cases. Results show that parameter significance rankings vary according to which design load case is considered. In general, uncertainties in the fatigue loads are highly influenced by turbulence intensity and wave load uncertainties, while uncertainties in soil property suggest significant nonlinear or interactive effects. This work provides insights to foundation designers and wind turbine manufacturers on which parameters must be assessed in more detail in order to reduce uncertainties in load prediction.

However, the severe offshore conditions make it necessary to develop reliable and cost-effective real-time monitoring system when building offshore wind power farms. This paper proposes an innovative method for designing remote monitoring system for offshore wind turbines based on ZigBee wireless sensor networks. ZigBee networks carrying variety of sensors actively collect dynamic data related to the system operation status, including parameters of the mechanical unit and electrical unit as well as the operation environment. Each wind turbine itself represents a single wireless network, which sends information to remote monitoring center by GPRS module to achieve full wireless communication. To enhance the topologic efficiency and reduce the energy consumption of the networks, an optimized routing algorithm is developed. A physical system based on such method is developed. Analysis and experiment tests with real wind farm data indicate that the developed system works fairly well. The fundamental idea as studied in this work is of great value for building reliable and affordable real-time monitoring systems for wind farms (offshore and on land) with enhanced safety and efficiency.

Furthermore, the effect-of wave slamming is analyzed for a monopile wind turbine foundation using a state-of-the-art aeroelastic model. The laboratory measurements were carried out in Deltares' Atlantic Basin as part of the joint industry project wave impacts on fixed turbines, in short JIP-WiFi. Long crested and irregular waves typical for the North Sea were applied and more than 130 design storms and 500 slamming impacts were analyzed. A simple closed form expression for the probability of wave slamming is presented and a reasonable agreement with the laboratory measurements shown. A criterion for when wave slamming should be included in design computations is formulated based on the sea state steepness. It is observed that wave slamming occurs during tests with a flat seabed, and that seabed features, such as sand waves, significantly increase the probability of wave slamming. Furthermore, a simplified slamming load formulation is proposed based on observations from a subset of the laboratory tests. The magnitude of the slamming load is validated against the remaining part of the laboratory measurements and compared with existing slamming load formulations. The new formulation is in better agreement with the underlying measurements than existing formulations and is of a simpler form which makes it easier to apply. The new slamming load formulation is applied in design computations for a realistic wind turbine with the offshore wind farm Gemini as base case. The computations show that wave slamming, at this specific location, is not governing the structural design. However, wave slamming may introduce high accelerations in the transition piece located in the free surface zone where waves are impacting the structure.",,,,,,,,,31,6,0,0,0,0,34,,,0378-3839,1872-7379,,,,,,,,,,"Deltares Harbour Coastal & Offshore, NL-2629 HV Delft, NetherlandsBLIX Consultancy BV, NL-3526 KL Utrecht, NetherlandsSiemens Gamesa Renewable Energy BV, NL-2595 BN The Hague, NetherlandsVattenfall Vindkraft AS, DK-6000 Kolding, Denmark",Deltares Harbour Coastal & OffshoreBLIX Consultancy BVSiemens Gamesa Renewable Energy BVVattenfall Vindkraft AS,,,2018-12-28,WOS:000452817100007,,

As a response the demand for sustainable energy, and consequently the establishment of wind farms, has increased worldwide. The positive effects of wind farms in reducing release of greenhouse gases are clear. In this article the negative effects of wind farms on raptors are reviewed and discussed.Several studies have shown that raptors are especially vulnerable to the establishment of wind farms, because raptors often are long lived and have a low reproductive rate.Three main factors affect raptors negatively in connection to wind farms; mortality, loss of habitat, and displacement due to increased disturbance from infrastructure. At the Smola wind farm in western Norway a significant reduction in reproductive success was found for the white-tailed eagle Haliaeetus albicilla within 500 m from the wind turbines. This is a very local effect, and the current population of the white-tailed eagle is stable and increasing. However, on average 8 white-tailed eagles have been found killed at the Smola wind farm each year in the period 2005-2010. Thus, the potential effect on the population could be drastic if the establishment of wind farms along the Norwegian coast continues to increase. This effect may be particularly severe the wind farms are established in prime white-tailed eagle habitat.The core area of individual birds is localized around available nesting sites and areas with high prey availability. By localizing these core areas when dealing with vulnerable species it would be possible to place wind turbines in areas where conflicts would be minimized. Hence, it is important to examine potentially affected areas thoroughly before the decision to establish a wind farm is made. Extensive and thorough preparatory work is probably the most important measure that should be taken to prevent the potentially harmful effects of wind farms.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,,,0014-8881,,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Miljo and Biovitenskap, Okol, Kraj, Norway",,,,2016-01-01,BCI:BCI201600090607,,

The worldwide installed capacity of offshore wind has now risen to over 7GW, with an ever increasing deployment rate of new assets. About 90% of the global currently installed capacity is in Northern Europe, with the United Kingdom having the world's largest share at 4GW. Capacity factor data from UK offshore wind farms is presented, providing an insight into the current performance of large Round 2 offshore wind farms compared to the earlier Round 1 farms and to onshore farms. The data reveal that the United Kingdom's Round 2 offshore farms are achieving an average monthly capacity factor of 38.3% with a peak value of 75.8%. The older Round 1 farms have a lower average capacity factor of 33.6% while large onshore farms with capacities above 100 MW have achieved 25.6%. Offshore wind turbine performance has improved over time, and the industry is applying the learning from early experiences to achieve better performances at the more recently installed farms. Despite these improvements in turbine availability, the cost of energy from wind, particularly offshore, remains too high for it to be a commercially viable form of generation without subsidies. Reducing the cost of energy from wind to economically sustainable levels is the most important challenge facing the industry today. Operation and maintenance costs constitute up to 30 % of the total cost of energy from wind in large farms. The industry must overcome the challenges associated with improving component reliability and the development and adoption by operators of appropriate condition monitoring systems and maintenance strategies, in order to reduce costs to sustainable levels.

Lower winter flounder abundances during the pile-driving time period and higher abundances during the cable-laying time period in the reference and wind farm areas suggest regionwide population fluctuations occurred.

Their omni-directional capability makes them a very interesting option for use with the frequently varying wind directions typically encountered in the built environment while their scalability and low installation costs make them highly suitable for offshore wind farms. However, they require further performance optimization to become competitive with horizontal axis wind turbines (HAWTs) as they currently have a lower power coefficient (Cp). This can be attributed both to the complexity of the flow around VAWTs and the significantly smaller amount of research they have received. The pitch angle is a potential parameter to enhance the performance of VAWT5. The current study investigates the variations in loads and moments on the turbine as well as the experienced angle of attack, shed vorticity and boundary layer events (leading edge and trailing edge separation, laminar-to-turbulent transition) as a function of pitch angle using Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) calculations. Pitch angles of 7 degrees to +3 degrees are investigated using Unsteady Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes (URANS) calculations while turbulence is modeled with the 4-equation transition SST model. The results show that a 6.6% increase in Cp can be achieved using a pitch angle of -2 degrees at a tip speed ratio of 4. Additionally, it is found that a change in pitch angle shifts instantaneous loads and moments between upwind and downwind halves of the turbine. The shift in instantaneous moment during the revolution for various pitch angles suggests that dynamic pitching might be a very promising approach for further performance optimization.

Together with increased power of the turbines the support structures are growing in size and weight. Many types of the support structures are being used depending mainly on the water depth. For a shallow waters the gravity based solutions are commonly used. For a water depth up to 25-30 m a mono pile type foundation are the most common solution. For a water depth over 30 m, jacket and tripod solutions are being used but in a very limited scale.

We studied the isotopic niche dimensions of three bat species that are frequently killed at wind turbines in Germany: non-migratory Pipistrellus pipistrellus, mid-distance migratory Nyctalus noctula, and long-distance migratory Pipistrellus nathusii. We measured stable carbon and nitrogen isotope ratios (delta C-13, delta N-15) in five tissues that differed in isotopic retention time (fur, wing membrane tissue, muscle, liver, blood) to shed light on the species-specific habitat use during the autumn migration period using standard ellipse areas (SEA(c)). Further, we used stable isotope ratios of non-exchangeable hydrogen (delta H-2(K)) in fur keratin to assess the breeding origin of bats. We inferred from isotopic composition (delta C-13, delta N-15) of fur keratin that isotopic niche dimensions of P. nathusii was distinct from that of N. noctula and P. pipistrellus, probably because P. nathusii was using more aquatic habitats than the other two species. Isoscape origin models supported that traveled distances before dying at wind turbines was largest for P. nathusii, intermediate for N. noctula, and shortest for P. pipistrellus. Isotopic niche dimensions calculated for each sample type separately reflected the species' migratory behavior. Pipistrellus pipistrellus and N. noctula showed similar isotopic niche breadth across all tissue types, whereas SEA(c) values of P. nathusii increased in tissues with slow turnaround time. Isotopic data suggested that P. nathusii consistently used aquatic habitats throughout the autumn period, whereas N. noctula showed a stronger association with terrestrial habitats during autumn compared to the pre-migration period.",,,,,,,,,31,1,1,0,27,0,34,,,1051-0761,1939-5582,,,,,,,,,,"Leibniz Inst Zoo & Wildlife Res, Evolutionary Ecol Res Grp, Alfred Kowalke Str 17, D-10315 Berlin, GermanyUniv Halle Wittenberg, Cent Repository Nat Sci Collect, Dompl 4, D-06108 Halle, Saale, Germany",,,,2016-04-01,WOS:000374840500010,27411249,

The tower and rotor-nacelle assembly (RNA) are considered as two rotational bodies in the space, for which two sets of Euler angles are defined and used to develop two systems of Euler dynamic equations of motion. Transformations between the various coordinate systems are derived in order to enable a solution for the motion of the tower, with gyroscopic, environmental, and restoring effects applied as external moments.

The extreme response and Fourier amplitude spectra for external moments and mudline bending moments are compared for these load cases where a simpler static pile-cap stiffness and a lumped-parameter model (LPM) are both considered. The fundamental frequency response of the system is well represented by the static pile-cap stiffness model; however, the influence of higher modes (i.e., the second and third modes with frequencies of about 1 Hz and 2 Hz, respectively) is significantly overestimated with the static model compared to the LPM.

Aimed at understanding the implications of this phenomenon, a campaign of structural condition monitoring was undertaken. The measurements showed significant axial displacements occurring between the transition piece and the monopile, which in turn resulted in a considerable amount of wear. Given the existing lack of technical data on the implications that this relative movement has on the wear of grouted connections, a methodology was developed to quantify the likely risk to the foundation integrity of the wear failure mode. The proposed approach consists of a numerical model which applies the wear rate derived from previous experimental testing to the conditions experienced by typical offshore grouted connections, as indicated by the wind turbine generators' supervisory control and data acquisition systems. The output of this model showed that, for a representative sample of the wind farm substructures analysed as a case study, the accumulated lifetime wear would be minimal in the majority of the grouted connection, i. e. less than 0.4 mm over 75% of the connection, but a much greater loss in thickness, of the order of 4 mm, was predicted at the very top and bottom of the connection. This assessment is based on the assumptions that no significant changes occur in the surrounding environmental conditions and that the degradation in the grouted connection does not significantly affect the dynamic response of the foundation structure over its life span. Importantly, these assumptions may affect themodel's predictions in terms of cumulatedwear over time, not in terms of identifying the individual connections to be prioritised when performing remedial work, which is indeed the main intended use of the model.

Land based windmills have been utilized for power generation for more than two thousand years. In modern times wind generated power has become popular in many countries. Offshore wind turbines are being used in a number of countries to tap the energy from wind over the oceans and convert to electric energy. The advantages of offshore wind turbines as compared to land are that offshore winds flow at higher speed than onshore winds and the more available space. In some land based settings, for better efficiency, turbines are separated as much as 10 rotor diameters from each other. In offshore applications where only two wind directions are likely to predominate, the distances between the turbines arranged in a line can be shortened to as little as two or four rotor diameters. Today, more than a dozen offshore European wind facilities with turbine ratings of 450 kw to 3.6 MW exist offshore in very shallow waters of 5 to 12 m. Compared to onshore wind turbines, offshore wind turbines are bigger and the tower height in offshore are in the range of 60 to 80 m. The water depths in oceans where offshore turbines can be located are within 30 m. However as the distance from land increases, the costs of building and maintaining the turbines and transmitting the power back to shore also increase sharply. The objective of this paper is to review the parameters of design for the maximum efficiency of offshore wind turbines and to develop types offshore towers to support the wind turbines. The methodology of design of offshore towers to support the wind turbine would be given and the environmental loads for the design of the towers would be calculated for specific cases. The marine corrosion on the towers and the methods to control the corrosion also would be briefly presented. As the wind speeds tend to increase with distance from the shore, turbines build father offshore will be able to capture more wind energy. Currently two types of towers are considered. Cylindrical tubular structures and truss type structures. But truss type structures have less weight and flexibility in design. The construction of the offshore towers to harness the wind energy is also presented.

Specifically, we focus on predicting the long-term fore-aft tower bending moment at the mudline and the out-of-plane bending moment at the blade root of a monopile-supported shallow-water offshore wind turbine. We employ alternative probabilistic predictions of long-term loads using inverse reliability procedures in establishing the characteristic loads for design. Because load variability depends on the environmental conditions (defining the wind speed and wave height), we show that long-term predictions that explicitly account for such load variability are more accurate, especially for environmental states associated with above-rated wind speeds and associated wave heights.

Dense sand often characterises the sea bed and suction caisson foundations are increasingly used to support offshore wind turbines at North Sea sites. Significant experience with this technology exists in the oil and gas industry, although these platforms are typically located in deeper water with predominantly clay soils. Therefore, research is required to transfer the existing knowledge. This paper discusses a series of centrifuge tests that investigate the installation and the load transfer mechanisms governing the response of suction caissons embedded in dense sand subjected to vertical cyclic loading. The effect of potential loosening of the internal soil plug during suction installation on the inservice foundation performance is evaluated through cone penetration tests inside the caisson following suction installation at different pumping flow rates. In accompanying tests, the load displacement behaviour in response to vertical cyclic loading is investigated, including significant excursions into tension. The results identify the pore fluid behaviour as the key factor affecting the response, with the pumping flow rate applied during installation being less influential. Based on the findings from the experiments a simplified approach for the prediction of suction caisson behaviour under vertical cyclic loading is presented.",,,,,,,,,12,0,0,0,0,0,12,,,0029-8018,,,,,,,,,,,"Hamburg Univ Technol, Inst Geotech Engn & Construct Management, Hamburg, GermanyUniv Western Australia, Ctr Offshore Fdn Syst, Perth, WA, Australia",,,,2020-10-15,WOS:000574667400002,,

The objective of developing wind energy offshore is to capture greater wind speeds than are encountered onshore and as a result more energy, With this also come more challenges in the design of wind turbines due to the hostile offshore environment. Currently the standards for offshore wind turbines prescribe a site specific design for the support structures and the design for the rotor nacelle assembly according to onshore standards. Wind turbines are designed to withstand fatigue and ultimate loads. For the fatigue loading several input conditions have been prescribed, amongst which wind profile is one of them. Wind profile is represented by power law or logarithmic law as given in the standards. A neutral stability of the atmosphere is considered while obtaining the wind profile using the logarithmic law. In this paper the atmospheric stability is varied in order to estimate different wind profiles and simulations are run in Bladed to check its influence on the fatigue damage at the blade root. The variations in the atmospheric stability has been taken into account by using some typical values of Obukhov length. From steady state simulations it has been found that atmospheric stability is important for fatigue damage. The analysis showed that variation in the distribution of atmospheric stability causes large variations in the fatigue damage for different sites.

Previous studies tried to assess the effects of landscape on mortalities. Yet, the count of carcasses found per species is low, leading to a low statistical power. Acoustic surveys collect large datasets (proxy for bat density); however, if bat vertical distribution is not accounted for, a key mechanism in collisions is missed. Objectives Our goal was to disentangle the effects of landscape on bat density and vertical distribution to produce recommendations for wind farm siting. Methods With a vertical array of two microphones, we monitored the acoustic activity and located the vertical distribution of more than 16 bat species on 48 wind masts in France and Belgium (> 8000 nights). We modelled bat density and vertical distribution for six species in function of distance to water, woodland and buildings, and in function of the topography at three different scales (200 m, 1000 m and 5000 m). Results The proportion of flights at heights with collision risk was maximum in spring and autumn and minimum in summer for three species. This effect was often antagonistic to the effect of bat density. The landscape had a stronger effect on bat density than on bat vertical distribution. Conclusions Positioning wind farms away from woodland should reduce the density and therefore the collision risks of low-flying species but should be inefficient for high-flying species. The effect of topography was stronger at large scales and complex, thus studying situations such as coastlines or mountain passes would provide more insight.",,,,,,,,,12,0,0,0,9,0,13,,,0921-2973,1572-9761,,,,,,,,,,"Sorbonne Univ, CNRS, Museum Natl Hist Nat, Ctr Ecol & Sci Conservat CESCO, CP 135,57 Rue Cuvier, F-75005 Paris, FranceBiotope, 22 Bd Marechal Foch, Meze, FranceUniv Paul Valery Montpellier 3, Univ Montpellier, CNRS, CEFE,EPHE,IRD, Montpellier, France",Biotope,,,2019-11-12,WOS:000493492100002,,

By applying Froude scaling, a scale model with a scale of 1:200 was designed and model experiments were carried out in a lab-scale wave flume that generated regular periodic waves by means of a piston-type wave generator while a wave absorber dissipated wave energy on the other side of the channel. The model was designed and manufactured based on the standard prototype of the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) 5 MW offshore wind turbine. In the first half of the study, the motion and structural responses for operational wave conditions of the North Sea near Scotland were considered to investigate the performance of a traditional TLP floating wind turbine compared with that of a newly designed TLP with added mooring lines. The new mooring lines were attached with the objective of increasing the horizontal stiffness of the system and thereby reducing the dominant motion of the TLP platform (i.e., the surge motion). The results of surge translational motions were obtained both in the frequency domain, using the response amplitude operator (RAO), and in the time domain, using the omega arithmetic method for the relative velocity. The results obtained show that our suggested concept improves the stability of the platform and reduces the overall motion of the system in all degrees-of-freedom. Moreover, the modified design was verified to enable operation in extreme wave conditions based on real data for a 100-year return period of the Northern Sea of California. The loads applied by the waves on the structure were also measured experimentally using modified Morison equationthe formula most frequently used to estimate wave-induced forces on offshore floating structures.

At present, there is a tendency to install larger-power wind turbines at larger distances from the seashore, on relatively deep waters. Consequently, technological solutions for new supporting structures intended for deeper water regions are undergoing rapid development now. Various design types are proposed and analysed, starting from gravitational supports (GBS), through monopiles and 3D frame structures (jackets, tripods), and ending with floating and submerged supports anchored to the seabed by flexible connectors, including TLP type solutions.The article presents the results of examination of an untypical large-size gravitational support intended for waters with the depth of up to 40 m. Firstly, a general concept of the new design is presented, while the next basic part of the article describes the support design in detail and provides its strength analysis. The examined support has the form of a large steel container consisting of conical segments. The strength analysis was conducted using the finite element method (FEM), in accordance with the standard DNVGL-ST-0126. Modifications introduced to the most heavily loaded structural node of the support, which was the set of base bottom trusses, is also included. The results of the performed analysis prove that the presented concept of supporting structure for a 7MW turbine meets fundamental strength criteria. The nonlinear buckling analysis was performed to evaluate the critical force acting on the support, which turned out to be 1.44 times as large as the maximum load of the wind turbine. Potentially important issues for further analyses have been identified as those resulting from the asymmetry of basic loads acting on the support.",,,,,,,,,16,1,0,0,0,0,17,,,1233-2585,,,,,,,,,,,"Gdansk Univ Technol, 11-12 Narutowicza St, PL-80233 Gdansk, Poland",,,,2017-06-12,WOS:000402372500021,,

This requires statistical extrapolation from turbine load data that may be obtained by simulation or by field tests. The present study illustrates such extrapolation that uses field data from the Blyth offshore wind farm in the United Kingdom, where a 2 MW wind turbine was instrumented, and environment and load data were recorded. From this measurement campaign, the load data available are in two different formats: as 10 min statistics (referred to as summary data) or as full time series (referred to as campaign data). The characteristics of the site and environment and, hence, that of the turbine response are strikingly different for winds from the sea and winds from the shore. The load data (here, only the mudline bending moment is studied) at the Blyth site are hence separated depending on wind regime. By integrating load distributions conditional on the environment with the relative likelihood of the different environmental conditions, long-term loads associated with specified return periods can be derived. This is achieved here using the peak-over-threshold method based on campaign data but long-term loads are compared with similar estimates based on the summary data. Winds from the shore are seen to govern the long-term loads at the site. Though the influence of wave heights on turbine long-term loads is smaller than that of wind speed, there is possible resonance of tower dynamics induced by the waves; still, to first order it is largely the wind speed and turbulence intensity that control design loads. Predicted design loads based on the campaign data are close to those based on the summary data discussed in a separate study.",,,,,,,,,1,1,0,0,0,0,2,,,0892-7219,,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Texas Austin, Dept Civil Environm & Architectural Engn, Austin, TX 78712 USA",,,,2008-02-01,WOS:000255252600005,,

This may reduce the stability of the mono pile and change the natural frequency of the dynamic response of an offshore wind turbine installed on it in an unfavourable manner. Using physical models and 3D computational fluid dynamic (CFD) numerical simulations, the velocity and bed shear stresses are investigated in complex scour protections around mono piles in steady current. In the physical model the scour protections consisted of an upper cover layer with uniformly distributed coarse stones and a lower filter layer with finer stones. For the numerical simulations, the Flow-3D software was used. The scour protection layers were simulated with different numerical approaches, namely regularly arranged spheres, porous media, or their combinations (hybrid models). Numerical simulations with one or four layers of cover stones without filter layer were first computed. Three additional simulations were then made for a scour protection with a cover layer and a single filter layer. Finally, a simulation of a full scale foundation and scour protection was made with porous media approach.Based on the physical and numerical results, a method to determine the critical stones size to prevent motion of the base sediment is established and compared to a full scale case with sinking of scour protection (Horns Rev I Offshore Wind Farm, Denmark). It is also found that the CFD simulations are capable of calculating the flow velocities when the scour protection is represented by regular arranged spheres, while the turbulence in general is underestimated. The velocity can also be calculated using porous media flow approach, but the accuracy is not as good as for spheres. The deviation is more severe for more complex scour protections. In general, computational models provide valuable information for the prediction and design of scour protections for offshore wind farms. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

As it is approaching toward deeper water depth, the dynamic response of the large floating wind turbine experiencing various environmental loads becomes more challenge. For examples, as the structural size gets larger, the dynamic interaction between the flexible bodies such as blades, tower and catenary mooring-lines become more profound, and the dynamic behaviors such as structural inertia and hydrodynamic force of the mooring-line get more obvious. In this paper; the dynamic response of a 5MW floating wind turbine undergoing dfflerent ocean waves is examined by our FEM approach in which the dynamic behaviors of the catenary mooring-line are involved and the integrated system including flexible multi-bodies such as blades, tower, spar platform and catenaries can be considered.Firstly, the nonlinear dynamic model of the integrated wind turbine is developed. Different from the traditional static restoring force, the dynamic restoring force is analyzed based on our 3d curved flexible beam approach where the structural curvature changes with its spatial position and the time in terms of vector equations. And, the modified finite element simulation is used to model a flexible and moving catenary of which the hydrodynamic load depending on the mooring-line's motion is considered Then, the nonlinear dynamic governing equations is numerically solved by using Newmark-Beta method.Based on our numerical simulations, the influences of the dynamic behaviors of the catenary mooring-line on its restoring performance are presented. The dynamic responses of the floating wind turbine, e.g. the displacement of the spar and top tower and the dynamic tension of the catenary, undergoing various ocean waves, are examined. The dynamic coupling between different spar motions, i.e. surge and pitch, are discussed too. Our numerical results show: the dynamic behaviors of mooring-line may significantly increase the top tension, particularly, the peak-trough tension gap of snap tension may be more than 9 times larger than the quasi-static result. When the wave frequency is much higher than the system, the dynamic effects of the mooring system will accelerate the decay of transient items of the dynamic response; when the wave frequency and the system frequency are close to each other, the displacement of the spar significantly reduces by around 26%. Under regular wave condition, the coupling between the surge and pitch motions are not obvious; but under extreme condition, pitch motion may get about 20% smaller than that without consideration of the coupling between the surge and pitch motions.",,,,,"36th ASME International Conference on Ocean, Offshore and Arctic Engineering36th ASME International Conference on Ocean, Offshore and Arctic Engineering","JUN 25-30, 2017JUN 25-30, 2017","ASME, Ocean Offshore & Arctic Engn DivASME, Ocean Offshore & Arctic Engn Div","Trondheim, NORWAYTrondheim, NORWAY",3,0,0,0,0,0,3,,,,,978-0-7918-5778-6,,,,,,,,,"AVIC Composite Corp LTD, Natl Key Lab Adv Composites, Beijing 100095, Peoples R ChinaChinese Acad Sci, Key Lab Mech Fluid Solid Coupling Syst, Inst Mech, Beijing 100190, Peoples R ChinaBeijing Univ Aeronaut & Astronaut, Sinofrench Engn Sch, Beijing 100191, Peoples R ChinaBeijing Univ Aeronaut & Astronaut, Sch Aeronaut Sci & Engn, Beijing 100191, Peoples R ChinaUniv Chinese Acad Sci, Sch Engn Sci, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China",,,,2017-12-22,WOS:000417228200074,,

The unique category codes were labeled by integrating the names from the three wind power sub-classifications, i.e., the axis of rotation of the wind turbine [horizontal axis wind turbine (HAWT), vertical axis wind turbine (VAWT)], the location of the installation [onshore (ON), offshore (OFF)], and the electricity production capacity [small (S), intermediate (I), large (L)]. The characterized wind electricity generation systems were statistically evaluated to assess the reduction in life cycle GHG emissions. A total of five unique categorization codes (HAWT-ON-S, HAWT-ON-I, HAWT-ON-L, HAWT-OFF-L, VAWT-ON-S) were designated to the 29 wind electricity generation LCA studies (representing 74 wind system cases) using the proposed categorization index. The mean life cycle GHG emissions resulting from the use of HAWT-ON-S (N = 3), HAWT-ON-I (N = 4), HAWT-ON-L (N = 58), HAWT-OFF- L (N = 8), and VAWT-ON-S (N = 1) wind electricity generation systems are 38.67, 11.75, 15.98, 12.9, and 46.4 gCO(2)e/kWh, respectively.

For this purpose, choosing the appropriate plates to set up wind turbines on the surface of sea is necessary. Regarding the installation condition, by choosing suitable geometry for floating breakwaters, offshore wind turbine can be mounted on them. Suitable geometry of breakwater for multifunctional usage could be selected with analyzing and comparing pressure, force and moment produced by incoming waves.

On the other hand, for promoting free surface in each time step, the EulerLagrangian method is employed. Finally, to find the appropriate geometry for installing the wind turbine on the breakwater, moment and wave profile next to the right and left side of breakwater body are calculated.

The tests were conducted on a monopile, a monopile with solid wheel, and a monopile with crashed stone wheel. The cyclic responses of the three models are described. Accumulated lateral displacements and lateral stiffnesses are investigated: the lateral displacement increases continuously with cycles but at a lower rate, and the stiffness tends to be larger during the cycles.

The observations from small-scale experiments confirmed that monopiles embedded in cohesionless soil undergoes progressive accumulation of displacement and the rate of accumulation does not approach zero even after 10,000 cycles. The accumulated rotation of the foundations under the offshore loading conditions mainly depends on the characteristics of cyclic loading such as the magnitude of maximum and minimum load during a cycle. The review of existing works showed that there are hardly any studies addressing the effect of gentle seabed slope and also the effect of multi-directional loading on the magnitude of accumulated rotation of rigid monopiles. It is critically suggested to consider the influence of strong vertical loads and moments on stiff monopiles installed on gentle seabed slopes.

Environmental parameters including the wind-wave misalignments play an important role for the safety of the installation tasks and govern the impact scenarios. The present study investigates the effects of wind-wave misalignments on the blade root mating process on a monopile-type offshore wind turbine. The dynamic responses including the impact velocities between root and hub in selected wind-wave misalignment conditions are investigated using multibody simulations. Furthermore, based on a finite element study, different impact-induced failure modes at the blade root for sideways and head-on impact scenarios, developed due to wind-wave misalignment conditions, are investigated. Finally, based on extreme value analyses of critical responses, safe domain for the mating task under different wind-wave misalignments is compared.

Most of these turbines promise a more economical performance if they operate for more than 20years. To assess a continued operation, we have to analyze the load-bearing capacity of the support structure with respect to site-specific conditions. Such an analysis requires the comparison of the loads used for the design of the support structure with the actual loads experienced. This publication presents the application of a so-called inverse load calculation to a 5-MW wind turbine support structure. The inverse load calculation determines external loads derived from a mechanical description of the support structure and from measured structural responses. Using numerical simulations with the software fast, we investigated the influence of wind-turbine-specific effects such as the wind turbine control or the dynamic interaction between the loads and the support structure to the presented inverse load calculation procedure. fast is used to study the inverse calculation of simultaneously acting wind and wave loads, which has not been carried out until now. Furthermore, the application of the inverse load calculation procedure to a real 5-MW wind turbine support structure is demonstrated. In terms of this practical application, setting up the mechanical system for the support structure using measurement data is discussed. The paper presents results for defined load cases and assesses the accuracy of the inversely derived dynamic loads for both the simulations and the practical application.

In the case of monotonic and slow cyclic lateral loading it is shown that imperfect interface bonding could reduce the moment capacity and may lead to foundation detachment or even uplifting in the case of shallowly embedded caissons. A preliminary comparison of two caisson alternatives has shown that increasing the caisson diameter while maintaining the embedment ratio is more efficient in terms of material resources than increasing the skirt length while keeping the diameter constant. The second part of the study evaluates the response of a soil-foundation-wind turbine interacting system subjected to earthquake shaking. Contrary to an often prevailing impression that seismic effects are insignificant, apparently originating from evaluating the seismic behaviour on the basis of spectral characteristics, it is illustrated that the system kinematics may prove crucial for the response of large wind turbines subjected to simultaneous environmental and seismic loads.

The order of magnitude of copper, aluminium, neodymium, lithium, nickel, zinc and platinum that may be required for the proposed solution is obtained and compared with available reserves. Overall, the proposed global alternative to fossil fuels seems technically feasible. However, lithium, nickel and platinum could become limiting materials for future vehicles fleet if no global recycling systems were implemented and rechargeable zinc-air batteries would not be developed: 60% of the current copper reserves would have to be employed in the implementation of the proposed solution.

When it comes to talk about offshore installation of pre-piled fixed jacket foundations (3-4 legs), one of the most critical activities to be performed by the installer is the grouting operation. For currently wind turbines size, pre-piling jacket installation is a very extended alternative used which are drilled into the seabed until only 4-5 m come out the seabed line. Once piles have been installed into the seabed it comes the time to proceed with jacket legs installation. Next step is to grouting-secured together both structures (pile and jacket) pouring grout, throughout the already pre-installed grouting lines into the lower part of the jacket leg. Due to complexity of the overall manoeuvre as well as required precision not only for the grout system but for the right parameters should be considered for pouring in order to ensure the grout correctly into the pile/jacket annulus without segregation or other undesirable effects occurring a mockup test was carried out. The proposed and analysed method defines a protocol that could be used and repeated for others offshore windfarms that are planned to be installed in the future over pre-pilled foundations.

This paper presents the results of an experimental investigation on damage evolution and failure mechanisms occurring within grouted connections in laboratory-based bending tests using acoustic emission. A parametric analysis of the detected acoustic emission signals has been conducted. The acoustic emission activity has been correlated with load-displacement measurements and the observed specimen failure modes. For the tested grouted connections, the number of acoustic emission hits and the signal duration were employed to identify damage evolution during load application.

Bat fatalities can be reduced by altering turbine operations, but such curtailment decreases turbine efficiency. If additional ways of reducing bat fatalities at wind turbines were available such tradeoffs might not be needed. Based on the facts that bats perceive distant objects primarily through vision and can see in very dim lighting conditions, and the possibility that bats might interact with turbines after approaching them as they would trees, we propose a novel method of reducing bat activity at wind turbines: illumination of the structure with dim light. As a first step toward assessing this approach, we illuminated trees with dim flickering ultraviolet (UV) light in areas frequented by Hawaiian hoary bats Lasiurus cinereus semotus, an endangered subspecies affected by wind turbines. We used a repeated-measures design to quantify bat activity near trees with acoustic detectors and thermal video cameras in the presence and absence of UV illumination, while concurrently monitoring insect numbers. Results indicate that dim UV reduces bat activity despite an increase in insect numbers. Experimental treatment did not completely inhibit bat activity near trees, nor did all measures of bat activity show statistically significant differences due to high variance in bat activity among sites. However, the observed decreases in bat activity with dim UV illumination justify further testing of this method as a means to reduce bat fatalities at wind turbines.",,,,,,,,,9,0,0,0,6,0,9,,,1863-5407,1613-4796,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Hawaii, Hawaii Cooperat Studies Unit, Hilo, HI 96720 USAUSGS, Ft Collins Sci Ctr, Ft Collins, CO 80526 USABat Res & Consulting, Tucson, AZ 85745 USAUSGS, Pacific Isl Ecosyst Res Ctr, Hawaii Natl Pk, HI 96718 USA",Bat Res & Consulting,,,2015-11-11,WOS:000363405400005,,

In finite element analysis, an integrated framework is suggested to create a simple yet accurate high fidelity model. The integrated framework accounts for not only the strain dependency of the soil but also for all dynamics in the seabed, including those of the soil, suction bucket skirt, and cap. Hence, the model accurately describes the coupling effect of translational and rotational motions of the seabed. The prediction results are compared to the experimental results obtained via full-scale testing in four stages during construction and in several operational conditions. The comparison shows that the stiffness of the suction bucket cap and strain dependency of the soil play a significant role in predicting natural frequency, suggesting that these two factors should be considered in finite element analysis for the accurate prediction of dynamic responses of an offshore wind conversion system. Moreover, dynamic analysis of the strain and acceleration measured during operational conditions shows that strain is more robust than acceleration with regard to the characterization of the overall dynamics of an offshore wind conversion system because the natural frequency of an offshore wind turbine is very low. It can be inferred that the measurement of strain is a more effective way to monitor the long-term evolution of dynamic characteristics. The suggested integrated framework and measurement campaign are useful not only to avoid conservatism that may incur additional costs during load calculation and design phases but also to establish an intelligent operation and maintenance strategy with a novel sensing technique.",,,,,,,,,8,1,0,0,0,0,9,,,1076-2787,1099-0526,,,,,,,,,,"Korea Inst Machinery & Mat, Dept Syst Dynam, Daejeon 34103, South KoreaKorea Elect Power Res Inst, Daejeon 34056, South KoreaChung Ang Univ, Sch Energy Syst Engn, Seoul 06974, South Korea",,,,2020-04-30,WOS:000526859800007,,

The purpose of our study was to measure the avoidance rates of Tasmanian wedge-tailed eagles (Aquila audax fleayi) and white-bellied sea-eagles (Haliaeetus leucogaster) using a new method, and to examine factors affecting these rates. We conducted eagle surveys at the Musselroe Wind Farm (undeveloped and used as a control); Studland Bay Wind Farm during commissioning and operational stages; and Bluff Point Wind Farm during the operational stage, all in northern Tasmania, Australia. Observers documented flight tracks and behavior of eagles over 875 days during the period 2006-2008. Both species demonstrated a distinct avoidance of the turbines, preferring to fly midway between them. Avoidance rates were 81%-97%, and differed significantly between species and sites, with white-bellied sea-eagles avoiding at a higher rate than wedge-tailed eagles. Eagles at Bluff Point had a higher avoidance rate than those at Studland Bay, even though the sites were only 3 km apart. Both species altered their avoidance rates in response to stages in the wind-farm development, but only the wedge-tailed eagle altered its rate in response to weather conditions, demonstrating a higher avoidance rate during wet and windy conditions. Our study found that the interaction of eagles and wind turbines is complex, which highlights the need for further study of avoidance rates in species at different sites.

The study involves proper planning and logistics to ensure that the field experiment survives the rough conditions of the North Sea for a duration of 111 days.

This study models the rocking vibration of a rigid disc foundation on a poro-elastic seabed, covered by a compressible inviscid seawater half-space. The coupled rocking problem is solved using the 3-dimensional elastic wave theory. The behavior of seawater and soil are depicted with the Euler equations and the Biot's theory, respectively. The contact surface of the disc foundation with the soil and the water is assumed to be smooth. The solutions are expressed in Fredholm integral equations of the second kind and solved numerically. The obtained dynamic impedances are used to study the dynamic behavior of Gravity Base Foundations of offshore wind turbines, which are very sensitive to dynamic moments. It is found that foundation with a permeable surface has much smaller dynamic amplitudes, compared to the one with an impermeable surface. The existence of seawater half-space will also alleviate the dynamic amplitudes, but decreasing the natural frequency of the foundation. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Acoustic telemetry was used and the Vemco VR2W position system was deployed to quantify the movement behaviour. In total, 22 Atlantic cod were tagged and monitored for up to one year. Many fish were present near the artificial reefs during summer and autumn, and demonstrated strong residency and high individual detection rates. When present within the study area, Atlantic cod also showed distinct habitat selectivity. We identified aggregation near the artificial hard substrates of the wind turbines. In addition, a clear seasonal pattern in presence was observed. The high number of fish present in summer and autumn alternated with a period of very low densities during the winter period.

Currently, the development of offshore floating wind turbines attracts lots of attention to harvest more energy from a sustained higher speed of offshore wind away from the coastline. With stronger cyclic wind and wave loadings, the floating wind turbine could possibly experience severe fatigue damages at certain critical locations, which might lead to a catastrophic failure. Evaluating accumulated fatigue damage for a floating wind turbine during its entire lifetime, therefore, becomes essential and urgent. As demonstrated in the codes, specifications, or design practices, fatigue assessments require massive computational costs and pose challenges to numerical simulations since lots of dynamic analyses under different environmental scenarios need to be performed. To reduce the calculation cost for this time-consuming process while maintaining high accuracy, a probabilistic long-term fatigue damage assessment approach is proposed in the present study by implementing a C-vine copula model and a surrogate model. The C-vine copula model provides a multivariate dependency description for the on-site wind and wave-related environmental parameters. Two surrogate models, including the Kriging model and the artificial neural network (ANN), are implemented to efficiently predict the short-term fatigue damages at critical locations of the floating wind turbine. The proposed long-term fatigue damage assessment framework is accurate and suitable for evaluating structural long-term fatigue damages accumulated in a real environment especially when effects from more environmental parameters are to be considered. Based on surrogate models, sensitivity analyses are carried out to investigate the relative significance of each environmental parameter on short-term fatigue damages. In addition, uncertainties from short-term fatigue damages are also incorporated into the probabilistic fatigue evaluation framework to assess the accumulated longterm fatigue damages for a spar type floating wind turbine.

A systematic methodology is proposed to optimize the costs of an OWF with ESS based on a framework that extends from the supervisory level dispatch strategies to individual pitch control for load reduction and fatigue mitigation. This holistic approach is able to improve the efficiency and economic performance of a wind farm through overall system optimization, while explicitly operating each wind turbine using a formally designed control framework leading to an extension of their service lifespan.

Through investigating and analyzing the maximum collision-force, the damage area, the maximum bending moment of piles at the seabed, the steel consumption and the maximum nacelle acceleration in different low-energy collision scenarios, it is found that the jacket generates the minimum collision-force, damage area and nacelle acceleration as well as the medium bending moment and steel consumption among the three. Therefore, the jacket has the optimum comprehensive anti-impact performance under low-energy collisions, which may be useful in developing the foundation design of offshore wind turbines.",,,,,,,,,40,9,0,0,0,0,49,,,0029-8018,1873-5258,,,,,,,,,,"Dalian Univ Technol, Fac Infrastruct Engn, Dalian 116024, Peoples R China",,,,2017-03-08,WOS:000393000700020,,

Conventional CMSs used in the power generation industry have been applied to WTs commercially. However, the operating environment of a WT is much different from that of a power plant. Moreover, current CMSs require the deployment of various sensors and computationally intensive analysis techniques. An empirical and low-cost CMS against shaft imbalance faults and generator circuit faults is proposed in this work. The diagnostic process of the CMS is merely based on generator outputs. Since the air gap between the rotor and the stator of a generator is limited by rigid bearings, diagnosis rules for shaft imbalance faults are formulated on the basis of experimental results with the aid of a specially designed WT simulation platform. Once a test at a specified speed has been performed, the error limits of the diagnosis for generator outputs can be determined. The proposed fault recognition procedure is practical and easy to conduct. The efficacy of the proposed CMS against four types of fault, namely, low-speed shaft imbalance, high-speed shaft imbalance, and short circuit and open circuit of a generator, has been validated practically on the WT simulation platform.",,,,,International Conference on Smart Science (ICSS)International Conference on Smart Science (ICSS),20192019,,JAPANJAPAN,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,0914-4935,,,,,,,,,,,"Natl Pingtung Univ, Comp & Intelligent Robot Program Bachelor Degree, 4-18 Minsheng Rd, Pingtung 90003, Pingtung County, TaiwanNatl Chin Yi Univ Technol, Dept Mech Engn, 57,Sec 2,Zhongshan Rd, Taichung 41170, TaiwanNatl Chin Yi Univ Technol, PhD Program, Grad Inst Precis Mfg, 57,Sec 2,Zhongshan Rd, Taichung 41170, TaiwanSouthern Taiwan Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Mech Engn, 1 Nan Tai St, Tainan 71005, Taiwan",,,,2020-03-27,WOS:000519724800009,,

The Atlantic coast and Gulf of Mexico of the U.S., with large wind resources and proximity to major population centers, are natural places for such development; however, these regions are also at considerable risk from severe hurricanes or tropical cyclones. Current international guidelines for the design of offshore wind turbines (OWTs) do not explicitly consider loading under hurricane conditions, however subsequent editions are anticipated to include language specific to hurricanes. Variability in extreme loads is greater in areas where hurricanes are likely and the design loads and risk profile of offshore structures installed in such areas are expected to be strongly influenced by hurricanes. For many offshore structures, environmental conditions at design recurrence periods and beyond are often estimated through extrapolation of long-term (i.e. multiple decades) wind and wave measurements from buoys, however, for offshore structures located at areas exposed to hurricanes, it is accepted practice to use physics-based models to augment the historical record of Atlantic hurricane activity and generate a stochastic catalog of synthetic hurricanes that provides tens of thousands of realizations for one year of potential hurricane activity. Once a stochastic catalog has been established, appropriate hazard intensity measures (e.g. the one minute sustained wind speed, the significant wave height, and the peak spectral wave period) can be estimated for each storm at any site using well-known wind and wave parametric models. In this study, we consider several sites along the Atlantic coast and quantify the impact of estimating hazard for design recurrence periods and beyond for three different methods. The first is based on an extrapolation of wind and wave measurements from buoys, and the second and third are based on a stochastic catalog of synthetic hurricanes with wind and wave intensities estimated based on deterministic and probabilistic relationships.",,,,,"34th ASME International Conference on Ocean, Offshore and Arctic Engineering (OMAE2015)34th ASME International Conference on Ocean, Offshore and Arctic Engineering (OMAE2015)","MAY 31-JUN 05, 2015MAY 31-JUN 05, 2015","Amer Soc Mech Engn, Ocean Offshore & Arct Engn DivAmer Soc Mech Engn, Ocean Offshore & Arct Engn Div","St John's, CANADASt John's, CANADA",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,978-0-7918-5657-4,,,,,,,,,"Northeastern Univ, Boston, MA 02115 USAUniv Massachusetts, Amherst, MA USAClemson Univ, Clemson, SC USA",,,,2016-09-02,WOS:000379793600059,,

Birds flight heights greatly influence this risk, yet height estimates are currently available only using methods such as radar- or ship-based observations over limited areas. Bird-borne data-loggers have the potential to provide improved estimates of collision risk and here, we used data from Global Position System (GPS)-loggers and barometric pressure loggers to track the three-dimensional movements of northern gannets rearing chicks at a large colony in south-east Scotland (Bass Rock), located <50 km from several major wind farm developments with recent planning consent. We estimated the foraging ranges and densities of birds at sea, their flight heights during different activities and the spatial variation in height during trips. We then used these data in collision-risk models to explore how the use of different methods to determine flight height affects the predicted risk of birds colliding with turbines. Gannets foraged in and around planned wind farm sites. The probability of flying at collision-risk height was low during commuting between colonies and foraging areas (median height 12 m) but was greater during periods of active foraging (median height 27 m), and we estimated that ~1500 breeding adults from Bass Rock could be killed by collision with wind turbines at two planned sites in the Firth of Forth region each year. This is up to 12 times greater than the potential mortality predicted using other available flight-height estimates. Synthesis and applications: The use of conventional flight-height estimation techniques resulted in large underestimates of the numbers of birds at risk of colliding with wind turbines. Hence, we recommend using GPS and barometric tracking to derive activity-specific and spatially explicit flight heights and collision risks. Our predictions of potential mortality approached levels at which long-term population viability could be threatened, highlighting a need for further data to refine estimates of collision risks and sustainable mortality thresholds. We also advocate raising the minimum permitted clearance of turbine blades at sites with high potential collision risk from 22 to 30 m above sea level.

The rising awareness of environmental impacts has led the public to demand the development of eco-friendly and dependable long-term solutions. Wind energy is acknowledged as among the best renewable energy sources with proven capabilities. The key contributing factor in defining the harnessing effectiveness is the wind availability and efficiency of the wind turbines at the specific wind conditions. But due to the non-uniform wind distribution and the limitations of the existing wind turbines at low wind speeds, countries with lower wind speed are still far away from exploiting wind energy.According to the World Energy Commission, the use of one million kWh of wind power can save 600 tons of CO2 emission. An examination into current energy data for Malaysia indicates that only 0.23% of the wind and solar power combined is employed for electricity production as of 2017. This is due to very low wind speed in this region throughout the year. It is also a leading factor to air-pollutants being suspended in the atmosphere for a longer period. It will impact an imbalance in the environmental conditions, such as acid rain, global warming, rise in sea-level and fluctuating sea levels.This paper reports an investigation into the potential impact of utilizing the advantages of wind energy technology in low speed wind regions as an air-pollutant free energy source, to contribute to the overall reduction of the Air Pollutant Index (API) in localized, impacted areas of Malaysia.

The grid-forming inverters adopt droop control method which allows parallel operation of several grid-forming sources. Droop control-based inverters are known as independent and autonomous due to the elimination of intercommunication links among distributed converters. Moreover, the adopted fixed speed wind turbine employs a squirrel cage induction generator which is well known for its robustness, high reliability, simple operation and low maintenance.

Most birds were found colliding with wind turbines during nights with bad flight and sight conditions (in terrestrial habitats ranging from a few up to a few tens of birds per turbine per year, depending on the local situation). Disturbance effects of turbines were negligible for breeding birds, and variable for feeding and resting birds, both in terrestrial and water habitats (up to over 500 m for Curlews). Recently, a study of nocturnal flight activities and flight altitudes in tidal and semi-offshore areas was carried out as part of a national research programme on bird hindrance by wind turbines. Radar studies around the Oosterschelde estuary, SW Netherlands, showed that nocturnal movements of tidal waders to and from inland high-tide roosting areas were predominantly below 100 m. inland high-tide roosts were often only occupied during darkness when sites were in or near shallow waters such as former creeks. in a few cases, former creeks were occupied during the night, but not during the day. Most diving-ducks wintering in Lake IJsselmeer roost during the day under the lee of dikes or in inland waters and feed at night off the coast. We found that flights of Scaups to and from the feeding grounds occurred predominantly during dusk and dawn. In contrast, Tufted ducks and Pochards flew mainly during darkness. Flight altitudes of the ducks were variable, but seldom over 100 m. Radar observations near a line of four middle-sized wind turbines in Lake IJsselmeer and situated in between the feeding and resting areas of Tufted ducks and Pochards revealed that during moonlit nights the birds crossed the line by passing between the turbines. During moonless nights, more birds flew parallel to the line and fewer perpendicular to the line than during moonlit nights. This led to a lower collision risk than expected when no evasive behaviour was shown. This data suggests that local wintering birds may get used to the turbines. The reactions of the ducks during moonless nights indicate, however, that a line of turbines can act as a flight path barrier for birds. By interrupting long lines the barrier effect can probably be diminished.",,,,,,,,,2,0,0,0,0,0,3,,,0024-1520,,,,,,,,,,,"DLO-Inst.

The main characteristics of the platform are its monolithic configuration and the use of concrete as main material. The monolithic nature allows avoiding joints between the substructure and the tower increasing the service life of the structure. The use of concrete increases the resistance when exposed to an offshore environment but requires ensuring a full compression state along the structure to avoid cracking. Thus, the platform is post-tensioned by longitudinal tendons along its length.Adequate fatigue design is a key factor to ensure the reliability of offshore structures. Floating Offshore Wind Turbines are subjected to cyclic phenomena coming from waves, wind, rotor-induced vibrations and structural vibrations. These loads have to be considered in order to assess the fatigue life of offshore structures. Furthermore, pre-stressed concrete adds an internal load such that it avoids the presence of tension stresses at any given section, which has a positive influence on the fatigue response of the structure by increasing its fatigue resistance. An excess of compression can, however, also induce an adverse effect on the fatigue resistance of the concrete.In order to study the fatigue behaviour of WindCrete when fitted with a 5MW Wind Turbine, a Fatigue Limit State verification is performed according to the DNVGL-ST-0437 for load cases definition and FIB Model Code (2010) for fatigue structural verification. The location chosen to install WindCrete is the Gulf de Lion, at the west of the Mediteranian Sea off the coast of Catalunya with a mean wind speed above 9 m/s. The metocean conditions for design purpose are presented, which are obtained from available environmental data.A total of 458 simulation cases are performed using the NREL FAST software assuming wind and wave co-directionally, and quasi-static mooring response for Parked and Power-Production operational modes. Assuming an elastic response of the tower, the internal stresses at the tower base are obtained for all the simulations. Then, a fatigue analysis is performed at the tower base through a cumulative damage approach based on the Palmgren-Miner rule. The analysis accounted for the multiaxial stresses produced by the combination of axial, bending and tangential forces. The S-N material curves were defined according to the Model Code 2010 method, which accounts for the effect of the stress range as well as the average stress.",,,,,2nd ASME International Offshore Wind Technical Conference (IOWTC 2019)2nd ASME International Offshore Wind Technical Conference (IOWTC 2019),"NOV 03-06, 2019NOV 03-06, 2019",,"St Julian's, MALTASt Julian's, MALTA",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,978-0-7918-5935-3,,,,,,,,,"Univ Politecn Catalunya BarcelonaTech, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Barcelona, Spain",,,,2020-04-17,WOS:000518042400013,,

The quadrature rule used in this work is a recently proposed implicit quadrature rule, which has the main advantage that it can be constructed directly using measurements of the environment. It is demonstrated that the proposed approach yields accurate estimations of the equivalent loads using a significantly reduced number of aeroelastic model evaluations (compared with binning). Moreover, the error introduced by the seeds (introduced by averaging over random wind fields and sea states) is incorporated in the quadrature framework, yielding an even further reduction in the number of aeroelastic code evaluations.

Since sites for the erection of wind turbines became scarce on land, ambitious plans for the offshore regions have arisen. There have been applications for 33 sites within the German Exclusive Economic Zone in the North and Baltic Seas, some of which entail several hundred individual turbines. Eleven pilot projects are approved, and two others rejected. As several hundred million birds cross the North and Baltic Seas at least twice every year, the Offshore Installations Ordinance says that licensing will not be given if the obstacles jeopardize bird migration. Birds are potentially endangered by offshore wind farms through collisions, barrier effects and habitat loss. To judge these potential risks, the occurrence of birds in space and time as well as details on their behaviour in general ( migration, influence of weather) and their behaviour when facing wind farms ( flight distances, evasive movements, influence of light, collision risk) need to be determined. Furthermore, the influences of construction and maintenance works must be considered. Since 2003, we have investigated year-round bird migration over the North Sea with regard to offshore wind farms. The main objectives were to assess data on the aforementioned aspects of bird migration over sea. These data can contribute to, for example, estimations of collision risks at offshore wind farms, the possible impacts on bird populations and possible mitigation measures. Results from measurements with different techniques, including radar, thermal imaging, and visual and acoustic observations, were compiled. The findings confirm that large numbers of diurnal and nocturnal migrants cross the German Bight. Migration was observed all year round but with considerable variation of intensity, time, altitude and species, depending on season and weather conditions. Almost half of the birds fly at 'dangerous' altitudes with regard to future wind farms. In addition, the number of individuals in reverse migration is considerable, which increases the risk of collision. We demonstrated that, especially under poor visibility, terrestrial birds are attracted by illuminated offshore obstacles and that some species collide in large numbers. Passerines are most frequently involved in collisions. Even if the findings regarding collisions at a research platform cannot be directly applied to offshore wind farms, they do show that on a few nights per year a large number of avian interactions at offshore plants can be expected, especially in view of the number and planned area of projected wind farms. We suggest abandonment of wind farms in zones with dense migration, turning off turbines on nights predicted to have adverse weather and high migration intensity, and actions to make wind turbines more recognizable to birds, including modification of the illumination to intermittent rather than continuous light, as the most appropriate mitigation measures. We further conclude that a combination of methods is necessary to describe the complex patterns of migration over the sea.

With the global trends in green energy, Taiwan are actively promoting the Thousand Wind Turbines Project from 2012. Up to now, there are three met masts in different offshore demonstration wind farms established in 2015 and two mono-pile foundations completed in 2016. The objective is to install about 800 offshore wind turbines, and 450 onshore wind turbines prior to the year of 2030. However, the planned location for potential offshore wind farms is close to the habitat of the Sousa chinensis (also called Indo-Pacific Humpback Dolphin or Chinese White Dolphin). Pile driving noise or operation noise have shown to cause behavioural disturbance or auditory damage to marine mammals. At a distance that is considered safe from PTS and TTS, noises from impact or vibratory pile driver are still high enough to disturb the behavior of marine mammals. In this study, underwater ambient noise measurements are shown to enhance the understanding of the soundscapes of the planned location for potential offshore wind farms. In the meantime, pile-driving noise measurements of two mono-pile foundations are made in 2016.

The mono pile foundation for 1.5MW offshore wind turbine is designed for Bohai Bay in China considering the soil and seabed condition. A three dimensional (3D) finite element model of mono pile is established to analyze horizontal ultimate bearing capacity, stress and deformation under lateral loads. Through the modal analysis, the natural frequencies of the mono-pile are given. Results show that the designed mono pile can effectively preclude resonance with the wind turbine. Dynamic responses under wave and seismic loads are analyzed by transient analysis method. And at same time, dynamic amplification factors of stress and deformation are studied. The paper reaches the conclusion that the dynamic effect must be attached importance in the design. Moreover, based on the theory of stability, the simplified method to assess the ultimate buckling moment of the mono pile is put forward. Comparisons are also made with results calculated by codified rules of DNV and ABS and Finite Element Method. Besides, fatigue analysis is carried out according the codified rules of API.

Mann's wind turbulence model was implemented into the CFD code as boundary and initial conditions. The wind turbulence model was validated by comparing the theoretical one-point spectrum for the three components of the velocity fluctuations, and by comparing the expected statistics from the CFD simulated wind turbulent field with the explicit wind turbulence inlet boundary from Mann model. Extensive simulations based on the proposed coupled approach were conducted with the conceptual NREL 5-MW offshore wind turbine in an increasing level of complexity, analyzing the turbine behavior as elasticity, wind shear and atmospheric wind turbulence are added to the simulations. Results are compared with the publicly available simulations results from 00 participants, showing good agreement for the aerodynamic loads and blade tip deflections in time and frequency domains. Wind turbulence/turbine interaction was examined for the wake flow. It was found that explicit turbulence addition results in considerably increased wake diffusion.

For this purpose, we proposed a framework for optimal design based on the neuro-response surface method (NRSM). The constructed framework is composed of three parts: the definition of the geometry, the generation of the design space, and an optimization process. To reduce the time for performance analysis and minimize the prediction errors, the approximate design space is generated using the back-propagation neural network which is considered as the NRSM. The optimization process is done for the generated design space by non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm-II (NSGA-II).

Main points studied were flight behavior of birds approaching turbines within 200-300 m distance in daylight and fine weather (good visibility), number of birds killed at night, and possible loss of breeding and feeding habitat around present sites of turbines. During just over 341 hours of observation, 87000 birds in 6200 flocks were recorded. Only 561 flocks (7-19%, on average 13%, of migrating flocks; 4-6%, on average 5%, or local flights) showed a change in flight behaviour that could be attributed to the turbines. No collisions with the turbines were seen. Among the studied factors, type of bird movement (migration or local flights), action of turbine (operating or not), site, bird species, time of day, flight height, distance to the turbine, wind force, and wind direction influenced the extent of hindrance. Some results were suggestive of habituation of local birds to wind turbines. Flock size did not seem to influence the response. Most responses (97% diurnal migrants, 100% local flights) were a temporary evasion of the entire turbine, 3% (diurnal migrants) came within reach of the rotor. Outside the rotor, a possible panic reaction was noted in 1% of the flocks. The majority (84-99%) of the flocks avoided the obstacles by shifting their flight paths to the side (most often by 16-45.degree.), mainly staying at the same height. Within the observed field, 27% of the diurnal migrants returned to the original track after reaction, none of the local birds. Of the 50 groups seen within reach of the rotor, 38% showed a reaction. Observations were not always equal for the entire field of observation; there was also a parallax problem. No dead birds were found in the vicinity (.ltoreq. 50 m) of the turbines. This confirms the scarce data from the literature, but is difficult to interpret because of lack of data on removal of killed birds by scavengers, and lack of data on migration extent at low altitudes during the study period. Nearly all present sites of turbines are situated near other interfering elements and have a low bird life, so it can be presumed that the effect of these turbines on breeding and feeding habitat of birds has been negligible. The results show that the chance of collisions of birds with medium-sized turbines in daylight and in weather with good visibility is almost zero. At present sites, the disturbing effect of such turbines hardly interferes with feeding and breeding birds, if at all. The results do not indicate the danger of collisions at night or in daylight during weather with poor visibility, the hindrance caused by other types of turbines (particularly large ones), by turbines at sites in the open field and by large groups of wind turbines (e.g. wind parks), and the risk at sites other than those studied.",,,,,,,,,5,0,0,0,3,0,6,,,0024-3620,,,,,,,,,,,"RIJKSINST VOOR NATUURBEHEER, POSTBUS 9201, 6800 HB ARNHEM",,,,1985-01-01,BCI:BCI198681051451,,

During the service period, the soil-pile interaction has a significant effect on the dynamic response of the OWT structure. Thus, this paper aims to first investigate the characteristics of soil-pile interaction under the cyclic loadings, and then study the dynamic responses of the jacket support OWTs. Based on the bounding surface elasto-plastic theory, the cyclic t-z curve is proposed, which used to simulate the load-displacement relationships along the pile shaft. Related parameters can be analyzed and calibrated based on the constant normal stiffness cyclic direct shear test of pile-soil interface. The cyclic t-z curves are programmed using the software COMSOL, and used in the FEM model for the dynamic simulation of jacket foundation OWT. Under two-way sinusoidal regular load case, the dynamic responses of jacket foundation OWT are simulated and studied. The results show that the API t-z curve will underestimate natural frequency, which leads to insecure design for jacket foundation OWTs.

A spar-type floating wind turbine concept is modeled and simulated using an aero-hydro-servo-elastic simulation tool (Simo-Riflex [SR]). Because the blade pitch system has the highest failure rate, a numerical model of the hydraulic blade pitch actuator with/without valve faults is developed and linked to SR to study the effects of faults on global responses of the spar-type floating wind turbine for different faults, fault magnitudes, and environmental conditions. The consequence of valve faults in the pitch actuator is that the blade cannot be pitched to the desired angle, so there may be a delay in the response due to excessive friction and the wrong voltage, or slit lock may cause runaway blade pitch. A short circuit may cause the blade to get stuck at a particular pitch angle. These faults contribute to rotor imbalance, which result in different effects on the turbine structure and the platform motions.

We have developed and validated the generic seismic coupled analysis and structural control architecture tool to overcome the limitation of numerical tools when examining the wind-wave-earthquake coupling effects. We investigated the dynamic responses of a 10 MW monopile offshore wind turbine under different loading combinations and found that the earthquake loading increases the tower-top displacement and pile-cap moment by 47.6% and 95.1%, respectively, compared to the wind-wave-only condition. It is found that the earthquake-induced vibration in the fore-aft direction is mitigated by the wind and wave loadings due to the energy dissipated by the aerodynamic and hydrodynamic damping. In addition, the tower responses are dominated by the earthquake excitation. In order to alleviate the tower vibration induced by the earthquake, we implemented the structural control capability within the tool using tuned mass dampers. The tuned mass dampers with appropriately selected design parameters achieve a larger mitigation on the tower-top displacement for the earthquake-only condition compared to the coupled-loading scenario. The reason is that the tuned mass damper is only effective in mitigating tower vibration, and it is not capable of reducing the tower elastic deformation which is the major contribution of the tower displacement for the coupled-loading condition. In addition, we have found that a heavier tuned mass damper requires a lower tuned frequency to achieve a larger mitigation. A configuration for the mitigation control of the 10 MW offshore wind turbine is suggested by using a 5% mass ratio of the tuned mass damper. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

In this work, concept design of a wind-tracing floating structure accommodating three wind turbines is presented. The triangular-shape floating platform is made of pre-stressed concrete, and the turbines are located on the corners. The floating structure uses a single-point mooring system which allows for the entire structure to rotate in response to the change of wind direction. Due to the particular configuration of the floating structure, it is essential to consider the wind, wave and current loads, along with the response of the structure, simultaneously.

We show here that after the arrival of the strong founding year class of 1998, significant self-recruitment to the Oregon and Washington populations occurred only in 2003, 2005 and 2006. Warm winter water temperatures, high Pacific Decadal Oscillation and Multivariate ENSO (El Nio Southern Oscillation) Indices in March, late spring transitions and weak southward shelf currents in March and April are all correlated with the these strong year classes. Cold winter water temperatures, low Pacific Decadal Oscillation Indices, early spring transitions and strong southward (and offshore) currents in March and April are linked to year class failure. Right now, green crabs are still too rare to exert a measurable effect on the native benthic community and on shellfish culture in Oregon and Washington.

This paper describes the modelling of two emerging electricity systems based on renewable energy: photovoltaic (PV) and wind power. The paper shows the approach used in the ecoinvent database for multi-output processes.Methods. Twelve different, grid-connected photovoltaic systems were studied for the situation in Switzerland. They are manufactured as panels or laminates, from mono- or polycrystalline silicon, installed on facades, slanted or flat roofs, and have a 3kWp capacity. The process data include quartz reduction, silicon purification, wafer, panel and laminate production, supporting structure and dismantling. The assumed operational lifetime is 30 years. Country-specific electricity mixes have been considered in the LCI in order to reflect the present situation for individual production stages.The assessment of wind power includes four different wind turbines with power rates between 30 kW and 800 kW operating in Switzerland and two wind turbines assumed representative for European conditions - 800 kW onshore and 2 MW offshore. The inventory takes into account the construction of the plants including the connection to the electric grid and the actual wind conditions at each site in Switzerland. Average European capacity factors have been assumed for the European plants. Eventually necessary backup electricity systems are not included in the analysis.Results and Discussion. The life cycle inventory analysis for photovoltaic power shows that each production stage may be important for specific elementary flows. A life cycle impact assessment (LCIA) shows that there are important environmental impacts not directly related to the energy use (e.g. process emissions of NO, from wafer etching). The assumption for the used supply energy mixes is important for the overall LCIA results of different production stages. The allocation of the inventory for silicon purification to different products is discussed here to illustrate how allocation has been implemented in ecoinvent. Material consumption for the main parts of the wind turbines gives the dominant contributions to the cumulative results for electricity production. The complex installation of offshore turbines, with high requirements of concrete for the foundation and the assumption of a shorter lifetime compared to onshore foundations, compensate the advantage of increased offshore wind speeds.Conclusion. The life cycle inventories for photovoltaic power plants are representative for newly constructed plants and for the average photovoltaic, mix in Switzerland in the year 2000. A scenario for a future technology helps to assess the relative influence of technology improvements for some processes in the near future (2005-2010). The differences for environmental burdens of wind power basically depend upon the capacity factor of the plants, the lifetime of the infrastructure, and the rated power. The higher these factors, the more reduced the environmental burdens are. Thus, both systems are quite dependent on meteorological conditions and the materials used for the infrastructure.Recommendation and Perspective. Many production processes for photovoltaic power are still under development. Future updates of the LCI should verify the energy uses and emissions with available data from industrial processes in operation. For the modelling of a specific power plant or power plant mixes outside of Switzerland, one has to consider the annual yield (kWh/kW(p)) and if possible also the size of the plant. Considering the steady growth of the size of wind turbines in Europe, the development of new designs, and the exploitation of offshore location with deeper waters than analysed in this study, the inventory for wind power plants may need to be updated in the future.",,,,,,,,,120,3,0,0,25,0,133,,,0948-3349,1614-7502,,,,,,,,,,"ESU Serv, CH-8610 Uster, SwitzerlandPaul Scherrer Inst, CH-5232 Villigen, Switzerland",ESU Serv,,,2005-01-01,WOS:000226379900004,,

In an offshore environment, a wind turbine foundation should be designed considering cyclic loading, which can lead to the permanent deformation of structures, tilting and the degradation of soil stiffness. However, there are several uncertainties in the prediction of the cyclic behaviour of the tripod foundation, since the cyclic horizontal, vertical and moment loadings applied on each bucket lead to a complicated mechanism for each bucket. In this study, the behaviour of the tripod foundation under cyclic loadings was indirectly investigated through the vertical compression and pullout tests of the bucket because the overturning moment applied to the tripod foundation presumably acts as vertical compressive and pullout loads on each bucket. A series of centrifuge model tests were performed by applying one-way (i.e. vertical compression and pullout) and two-way cyclic loadings to the single bucket. Additionally, the effects of cyclic loading level were investigated. It was confirmed that the cyclic behaviour of the single bucket is significantly affected by loading direction and level.

The structure and all structural members shall be designed in a way that they can be resistant against different kinks of loads: permanent, variable, environmental, accidental and deformations. This paper is focused on those called environmental loads. The main environmental conditions that may contribute to structural damage, operational disturbances or other failures are wind, waves, currents and sea ice. Thus, the combination of the different parameters may produce many different critical situations for the integrity of the structure, requiring the calculation of long time series corresponding to long-term historical data situations. The most accurate techniques available at the moment to estimate loads acting upon a structure are numerical and physical models; however, they are very time consuming, and the calculation of long time series of data is unfeasible. Therefore, a new hybrid methodology to select waves-wind-current representative conditions that allow the interpolation of long time series of forces on a wind turbine is proposed. The methodology consists of a selection of a subset of representative cases of wave-wind-current climate at the structure's location by using a maximum dissimilarity algorithm, then estimating loads acting upon the structure for the sea-wind states selected and the reconstruction of loads corresponding to historical data using an interpolation technique based on radial basis function. To validate the proposed methodology and because of there is no availability of long time records of loads on wind turbines, the well-known IEC 61400-3 has been applied to estimate the loads for the complete reanalysis time series of waves, winds and currents. The validation of the results confirms the ability of the methodology developed to reconstruct time series of forces on the structure on the basis of the previously selected cases. This methodology permits application of numerical and physical models to offshore wind farm design, considerably reducing the number of tests or simulations.

Robots present a cost-effective and safe method for inspection, repair, and maintenance of topside and marine offshore infrastructure. In this work, we introduce a new multi-sensing platform, the Limpet, which is designed to be low-cost and highly manufacturable, and thus can be deployed in huge collectives for monitoring offshore platforms. The Limpet can be considered an instrument, where in abstract terms, an instrument is a device that transforms a physical variable of interest (measurand) into a form that is suitable for recording (measurement). The Limpet is designed to be part of the ORCA (Offshore Robotics for Certification of Assets) Hub System, which consists of the offshore assets and all the robots (Underwater Autonomous Vehicles, drones, mobile legged robots etc.) interacting with them. The Limpet comprises the sensing aspect of the ORCA Hub System. We integrated the Limpet with Robot Operating System (ROS), which allows it to interact with other robots in the ORCA Hub System. In this work, we demonstrate how the Limpet can be used to achieve real-time condition monitoring for offshore structures, by combining remote sensing with signal-processing techniques. We show an example of this approach for monitoring offshore wind turbines, by designing an experimental setup to mimic a wind turbine using a stepper motor and custom-designed acrylic fan blades. We use the distance sensor, which is a Time-of-Flight sensor, to achieve the monitoring process. We use two different approaches for the condition monitoring process: offline and online classification. We tested the offline classification approach using two different communication techniques: serial and Wi-Fi. We performed the online classification approach using two different communication techniques: LoRa and optical. We train our classifier offline and transfer its parameters to the Limpet for online classification. We simulated and classified four different faults in the operation of wind turbines. We tailored a data processing procedure for the gathered data and trained the Limpet to distinguish among each of the functioning states. The results show successful classification using the online approach, where the processing and analysis of the data is done on-board by the microcontroller. By using online classification, we reduce the information density of our transmissions, which allows us to substitute short-range high-bandwidth communication systems with low-bandwidth long-range communication systems. This work shines light on how robots can perform on-board signal processing and analysis to gain multi-functional sensing capabilities, improve their communication requirements, and monitor the structural health of equipment.",,,,,,,,,15,0,0,0,1,0,15,,,,1424-8220,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Edinburgh, Sch Engn, Inst Integrated Micro & Nano Syst, Scottish Microelect Ctr, Alexander Crum Brown Rd,Kings Bldg, Edinburgh EH9 3FF, Midlothian, ScotlandUniv Edinburgh, EPSRC, Ctr Doctoral Training CDT Robot & Autonomous Syst, Sch Informat, Edinburgh EH9 3LJ, Midlothian, Scotland",,,,2018-12-28,WOS:000448661500315,30332821,

The proposed eccentric jacket comprises of completely overlapped joint at every joint connection. The joint consists of a chord and two braces in a single plane. The two braces are fully overlapped with a short segment of the diagonal brace welded directly onto the chord. The characteristic feature of this joint configuration is that the short segment member can be designed to absorb and dissipate energy under cyclic load excitation. The experimental and numerical study revealed that the completely overlapped joint performed better in terms of strength resistance, stiffness, ductility, and energy absorption capacity than the conventional gap joints commonly found in typical X-braced jacket framings. The eccentric jacket could also be designed to becoming less stiff, with an inelastic yielding and local buckling of short segment member, so as to better resist the cyclic load generated from intense environmental forces and earthquake. From the design economics, the eccentric jacket provided a more straightforward fabrication with reduced number of welded joints and shorter thicker wall cans than the conventional X-braced jacket. It can therefore be concluded based on the results presented in the study that by designing the short segment member in accordance with strength and ductility requirement, the eccentric jacket substructure supporting the wind turbine could be made to remain stable under gravity loads and to sustain a significantly large amount of motion in the event of rare and intense earthquake or environmental forces, without collapsing.",,,,,,,,,3,0,0,0,0,0,3,,,1671-9433,1993-5048,,,,,,,,,,"Maritime Prod Res Pte Ltd, Singapore 915806, SingaporeNanyang Technol Univ, Sch Civil & Environm Engn, Singapore 639798, SingaporeGlobal Maritime Consultancy Ltd, London EC2A 2DX, England",Maritime Prod Res Pte LtdGlobal Maritime Consultancy Ltd,,,2019-05-17,WOS:000466720400011,,

To explore this balance, we developed a simulation model for different operation and maintenance strategies that provides information about accessibility of wind turbines, technical availability of the wind farm, and the mean time to repair. The model represents the maintenance process using discrete events steered by stochastic environmental and process related input parameters. It is built upon the abundance on existing maintenance simulation models for off-shore wind farm and can therefore be considered as stable enough to explore the specific effects of health and safety modeling aspects. The model implements health and safety aspects using a rule-based decision system that defines certain thresholds beyond which maintenance processes will not be carried out.

Through multi-criteria evaluation, the feasibility of the study area for this activity was analyzed according to suitability and constraint criteria. The assessment of suitability was based on wind energy exploitation, while the constraint analysis was based on the environmental legislation, social aspects and exclusion areas.

Hybridization of wave energy with other renewable resources, such as solar, wind, or storage systems, is a reliable way to generate and provide electricity for remote cities. Considering high solar and wind potential and accessibility to three marine areas, including the Persian Gulf, the Gulf of Oman, and the Caspian Sea, Iran is an appropriate place to exploit hybrid energy systems. In this paper, for the first time, a techno-economic and environmental analysis for a hybrid renewable energy system consisting of Wave Energy Converter/PV/Wind Turbine/Battery is performed aiming to provide electricity for 3000 households in three different locations of Iran (Jask, Genaveh, and Anzali cities). The results indicate that the PV/Wind Turbine/Battery system (with the energy cost of 0.219, 0.233 and 0.242 dollars per kWh for Jask, Genaveh, and Anzali, respectively) is the best option for supplying electricity for 3000 households. Furthermore, according to the sensitivity analysis, Anzali demonstrates a higher potential to employ Pelamis in the optimum system, owing to the higher potential of waves in the Caspian Sea. The cost of energy in the hybrid system with a Pelamis converter is obtained 0.233 $/kWh to 0.348 $/kWh. This indicates greater economic profit and higher power capabilities for off-grid systems, compared to the global cost of wave energy converter systems. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

If a jack-up vessel is used during an o shore installation, the wind turbine blade is mainly subjected to wind loads and experiences resonant motions, and the monopile is subjected to wave-induced vibrations. The blade mating process can be challenging if large relative motions occur between the blade root and the monopile top. This study numerically models a blade installation system that consists of a pre-installed monopile and nacelle assembly, and a 5 MW blade with tugger lines. By analyzing the blade-root and the hub motion radii from time-domain simulations, we evaluate the effects of mean wind speed, wind turbulence, significant wave height, wave spectrum peak period, wind-wave misalignment, and water depth on the blade installation. For the alignment phase, the blade-root motion is critical, especially when the mean wind speed and turbulence are high. The hub motion can be important when the monopile resonant responses are prominent. The relative in-plane motions rather than the hub or the blade motion alone should be considered during the assessment. For the mating phase, the high-frequency components of the responses are important in general. Because of the dominant flange-hole motions at the monopile top, an increase in water depth reduces the success rate of mating.",,,,,,,,,34,3,0,0,0,0,35,,,0141-0296,1873-7323,,,,,,,,,,"Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol NTNU, Dept Marine Technol, NO-7491 Trondheim, NorwayNTNU, Ctr Marine Operat Virtual Environm SFI MOVE, NO-7491 Trondheim, NorwayNTNU, Ctr Autonomous Marine Operat & Syst SFF AMOS, NO-7491 Trondheim, NorwayShanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Sch Naval Architecture Ocean & Civil Engn, Shanghai 200240, Peoples R ChinaSJTU, State Key Lab Ocean Engn, Sch Naval Architecture Ocean & Civil Engn, Shanghai 200240, Peoples R ChinaSJTU, Collaborat Innovat Ctr Adv Ship & Deep Sea Explor, Shanghai 200240, Peoples R ChinaSJTU, Key Lab Hydrodynam, Minist Educ, Shanghai 200240, Peoples R China",,,,2018-10-11,WOS:000445440300076,,

An enhanced active power control scheme of the offshore MMC station is proposed to improve the power flow distribution between the MMC-HVDC and DR-HVDC links which are both connected to the offshore wind farm (OWF) ac network. By regulating the offshore voltage, all the wind powers are transmitted via the DR-HVDC link in low wind conditions while the offshore MMC power is controlled around zero to reduce transmission losses, considering the efficiency superiority of DR-HVDC over its MMC counterpart. When the DR-HVDC is out of service, wind energy is transferred via the MMC-HVDC and the wind turbine (WT) generated power is automatically limited by slightly increasing the offshore ac voltage to avoid potential MMC-HVDC overload. A power curtailment control is also proposed which slightly increases the dc voltage of the DR-HVDC to enable autonomous reduction of the generated wind power so as to avoid DR-HVDC overload during MMC-HVDC outage. The proposed coordinated control only uses local measurements and, without the need for communication, can seamlessly handle transitions including various faults.

Damage density is identified to be a heterogeneous function of the loading environmental conditions. In some cases, even for low SN slope materials, most of the damage occurs due to high load ranges. To study on the influence of this heterogeneity, different statistical tail fits are used to compare the influence of accurately defining the tail region on a reference design time (T). Results show that OWT fatigue is highly dependent on the t shorter that T time used to approximate T.

Here, we present first data on fatality rates, fatality factors and the likely origin of bats killed by WT in the Dobrogea region (Romania), located in a major migratory corridor for wildlife in Eastern Europe. Over a 4-year period, we found a total of 166 bat carcasses from 10 species, mostly representing migratory species such as Pipistrellus nathusii and Nyctalus noctula. Most fatalities at WT occurred in July and August. We documented 15 cases of barotrauma and 34 cases of blunt-force trauma in carcasses found below WT. After adjusting for carcass removals and variations in searcher efficiency, we estimated for the 4-year study period a total of 2394 bat casualties at the studied WT facility consisting of 20 units, resulting in a mean fatality rate of 30 bats/WT/year, or 14.2 bats/MW/year. By implementing a curtailment measure at wind speeds below 6.5 m/s, we reduced fatality rates by 78%. Isoscape origin models based on hydrogen stable isotope ratios in fur keratin revealed that the majority of N. noctula that were killed by WT or captured nearby in mist nets originated from distant areas in the North (Ukraine, Belarus, Russia).

A solution is to deploy dedicated sensor networks fabricated from inexpensive materials and electronics. The authors have recently developed a novel large-area electronic sensor measuring strain over very large surfaces. The sensing system is analogous to a biological skin, where local strain can be monitored over a global area. In this paper, we propose the utilization of a hybrid dense sensor network of soft elastomeric capacitors to detect, localize, and quantify damage, and resistive strain gauges to augment such dense sensor network with high accuracy data at key locations. The proposed hybrid dense sensor network is installed inside a wind turbine blade model and tested in a wind tunnel to simulate an operational environment.

The spar is installed in a water depth of 320 m. The coupled wind and wave analysis is performed by coupling aerodynamic software FAST (Jonkman and Bull Jr,2005) and hydrodynamic software ANSYS-AQWA(2010). The global time domain responses of the spar type OWT is calculated for 600 s. The wave spectrum has significant wave height 6m and peak spectral period 10s and follows Pierson-Moskowitz spectrum. For safe operation, the structures should survive against different environmental conditions. The OWT can fail either in the operational regime or in the harsh environmental conditions. Therefore the dynamic simulation is carried out for two wind speeds, i.e., one in operational (hub height wind speed as 11.5 m/s) regime and another in idling condition (30 m/s) using the above wave parameters. Monte Carlo method is used to simulate the OWT responses in irregular wave loading condition. After obtaining the time-domain nonlinear responses, the 3-hr short term extreme responses are obtained which are useful for design of OWT. The 3-hr extreme response is obtained using Global Maxima Method (GMM). In Global Maxima Method, one maximum is taken from each time series and the maxima are fitted to two Generalized Extreme Value distributions, viz., Gumbel and Weibull distribution. The results show that Weibull fit is on a conservative side than Gumbel fit. Since the calculation of extremes is dependent on time domain simulations, a comparative study is also done for 100 and 20 samples so as to understand the sensitivity of extreme values due to lower sample size.

The stress transfer function is obtained by carrying out dynamic finite element analysis in the frequency domain. A wave scatter diagram of the North Atlantic is used in order to account for the environmental effects. The stress transfer function is formulated such that a sufficient number of frequencies can be used in the Inverse Fast Fourier Transform with random phase angles in order to obtain the stress time histories.

Logistic delays and weather conditions are also obstacles for performing maintenance activities. To save logistic cost and downtime loss, a two-level maintenance policy considering both periodic maintenance planning and reactive maintenance is developed. The first level is aimed at failure modes whose degradation process is black-box by grouping individual maintenance activities according to their own maintenance period.

The results show that the joint behaviour of wind speed and wave height follows a similar pattern around the North Sea. In addition, the mean difference of generated lumped wind speeds based on this technique from lumped wind speeds based on real measurements is less than 5%. The mean difference of the fatigue damage caused by the generated lumped wind speeds relative to lumped wind speeds based on real measurements is less than 5% at two locations, and less than 15% in another location. This suggests that the approach is promising for estimating joint met-ocean data at new locations in the North Sea where only marginals are available, which is of major interest for wind farm planning and design.",,,,,16th Deep Sea Offshore Wind R and D Conference (EERA DeepWind)16th Deep Sea Offshore Wind R and D Conference (EERA DeepWind),"JAN 16-18, 2019JAN 16-18, 2019",NTNU; European Energy Res AllianceNTNU; European Energy Res Alliance,"SINTEF, Trondheim, NORWAYSINTEF, Trondheim, NORWAY",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,1742-6588,1742-6596,*****************,,,,,,,,,"NTNU, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Hogskoleringen 7A, N-7491 Trondheim, Norway",,,,2020-09-08,WOS:000562374000042,,

This paper presents a design optimization and a coupled dynamics analysis of a platform with a single tether anchored to the seabed supported for a 5 MW baseline wind turbine. The design is based on a concept named SWAY. We conduct a parametric optimization process that accounts for important design considerations in the static and dynamic view, such as the stability, natural frequency, performance requirements, and cost feasibility. Through these optimization processes, we obtain and present the optimized model. We then establish the fully coupled aero-hydro-servo-elastic model by the time-domain simulation tool FAST (Fatigue, Aerodynamics, Structures, and Turbulence) with the hydrodynamic coefficients from an indoor program HydroGen. We conduct extensive time-domain simulations with various wind and wave conditions to explore the effects of wind speed and wave significant height on the dynamic performance of the optimized SWAY model in various water depths. The swivel connection between the platform and tether is the most special design for the SWAY model. Thus, we compare the performance of models with different tether connection designs, based on the platform motions, nacelle velocity, nacelle accelerations, resonant behaviors, and the damping of the coupled systems. The results of these comparisons demonstrate the advantage of the optimized SWAY model with the swivel connection. From these analyses, we prove that the optimized SWAY model is a good candidate for deep water deployment.",,,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,,,,1996-1073,,,,,,,,,,"Texas A&M Univ, Dept Ocean Engn, College Stn, TX 77084 USAMIT, Dept Mech Engn, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA",,,,2020-08-12,WOS:000554232500001,,

This can enable one to estimate design loads for a prescribed level of return period, generally on the order of 20-50 years for offshore wind turbines. In a probabilistic approach, one first needs to establish short-term distributions of the load random variable(s) conditional on the environment; this is achieved either by using simulation or field measurements. In the present study, we use field data from the Blyth offshore wind farm in the United Kingdom, where a 2 MW wind turbine was instrumented, and environment and load data were recorded. The characteristics of the environment and, hence, that of the turbine response at the site are strikingly different for wind regimes associated with different wind directions. Here, we study the influence of such contrasting environmental (wind) regimes and associated waves on long-term design loads. The field data, available as summary statistics, are limited in the sense that not all combinations of environmental conditions likely to be experienced by the turbine over its service life are represented in the measurements. Using the available data, we show how distributions for random variables describing the environment (i.e., wind and waves) and the turbine load of interest (i.e., the mudline bending moment) can be established. By integrating load distributions, conditional on the environment with the relative likelihood of different environmental conditions, long-term (extreme/ultimate) loads associated with specified return periods can be derived. This is demonstrated here by carefully separating out the data in different wind direction sectors that reflect contrasting wind (and accompanying wave) characteristics in the ocean environment.

The turbulent wind field simulation was performed by TurbSim, and the load of wind waves on structures was generated by FAST, which were all developed by the NREL (National Renewable Energy Laboratory). In addition to wind and waves, the seismic force was also considered. The cylindrical TLD was located above the rotor nacelle assembly (RNA). A TLD has different damping effects when acting under wind, wave, and earthquake loads, respectively. The effect of the TLD regarding motion reduction on the OWT under coupled wind, wave, and seismic loads was studied. This study also designed a simple experiment to verify the correctness of the numerical simulation results. Fatigue analysis shows that multi-layer TLDs can extend the fatigue life (37%) of an OWT. In addition, under extreme environmental load conditions, multi-layer TLDs have a better vibration damping performance than single-layer TLDs.

Furthermore, depending on the turbine rated power and the chosen design (all current designs are soft-stiff), target natural frequency requirements must also be met. Most of these calculations require the knowledge of the stiffnesses of the foundation which, especially in the case of large turbines in intermediate waters (30-60 m), might need to be configured using multiple foundation elements. For this reason, this paper studies, for a homogeneous elastic halfspace, the static stiffnesses of groups of polygonally arranged non-slender suction bucket foundations in soft soils modeled as rigid solid embedded foundations. A set of formulas for correcting the stiffnesses obtained from isolated foundation formulation are proposed. It is shown through the study of several multi-megawatt OWTs that, as expected, group effects becomes more relevant as spacing decreases. Also, group effects are sensitive mainly to shear modulus of soil, foundation shape ratio and diameter, and the number of foundations. The results obtained from the soil-structure system show that ignoring group effects may add significant errors to the estimation of OWT fundamental frequencies and leads to either overestimating or underestimating it by 5%. This highlights the importance of adequately modeling the interaction between elements of closely-separated multi-bucket foundations in soft soils, when current guidelines specify the target fundamental frequency to be at least 10% away from operational 1P and blade passing frequencies (2P/3P frequencies).",,,,,,,,,8,0,0,0,0,0,8,,,0951-8339,1873-4170,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Las Palmas Gran Canaria, Inst Univ SIANI, Las Palmas Gran Canaria 35017, SpainUniv Surrey, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Guildford GU2 7XH, Surrey, England",,,,2019-04-18,WOS:000463299800019,,

Life extension is considered the most desirable EOL scenario due to its profitability.

This implies that an accurate design load prediction, especially of those resulting in fatigue damage accumulation, may help achieve more cost-effective solutions. In this article, the impact of turbulence and wave loads on fatigue reliability of pile foundations is investigated for a 5-MW offshore wind turbine. Loads obtained by varying turbulence percentiles are compared with those obtained from the full joint probability distribution of wind speed and turbulence through Monte Carlo (MC) simulations, and from the equivalent turbulence level currently adopted by IEC standards. The analyses demonstrate that a lower equivalent turbulence percentile leads to a more realistic and less conservative estimation of fatigue loads. Subsequently, the research focuses on studying the effects of uncertain marine environments on the fatigue load distribution, showing that the latter is insensitive to the random variability of the hydrodynamic coefficients. With respect to the wave kinematic model, a comparison between nonlinear and linear waves clearly suggests that hydrodynamic forces depend significantly on the kinematic model adopted and the operational conditions of the turbine. Furthermore, a term is derived to correct the error introduced by Wheeler stretching at finite water depths. The respective model uncertainties that originate from the nonlinear irregular wave model and Wheeler correction are quantified and employed in a reliability analysis.

Results show that the potential offshore wind farm area in and beyond (2 km away from its boundary) Hong Kong is 357.78 km(2) (21.68% of the HK water area) and southeastern water area is the most suitable location for offshore wind farm development. In additions, the potential annual offshore wind power generation is 112.81 x 10(8) kW h which accounts for 25.06% of the total annual power consumption in 2011 if the wind turbine layout is optimized. The potential monthly offshore wind power contribution to the electricity demand is the highest in October (46.46%) and lowest in August (7.93%). (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

The huge market potential and fast development of wind turbine manufacturing capacity are making China a world leader in wind power development. In 2010, with the newly installed wind power capacity and the cumulative installed capacity, China was ranked first in the world. In 2009, China also constructed and commissioned its first large offshore wind farm near Shanghai.Following earlier papers reviewing the state of China's onshore wind industry, this paper presents a broader perspective and up-to-date survey of China's offshore wind power development, making comparisons between the developments in the rest of the world and China, to draw out similarities and differences and lessons for the China offshore wind industry.The paper highlights six important aspects for China's offshore wind development: economics, location, Grid connection, technological development, environmental adaptation and national policies.The authors make recommendations for mitigating some outstanding issues in these six aspects for the future development of China's offshore wind resource.

The proposed control functionalities are responsible for mitigating the DC voltage rise effect resulting from the reduction of active power injection into onshore AC systems during grid faults. The proposed strategies envision a fast control of the wind turbine active power output as a function of the DC grid voltage rise and constitute alternative options in order to avoid the use of classical solutions based on the installation of chopper resistors in the MTDC grid.

The performances were evaluated and compared at selected typical wind speeds within the whole operational region under three turbine layout strategies, i.e., column, row and array arrangements, together with a single turbine case as reference, utilizing our newly developed aero-servo-elastic platform. It was observed that not only the blade fatigue loads but the stabilities of power and collective pitch angle were effectively controlled for all cases, especially at the highest studied hub velocity of 20 m/s, leading to the averaged reduction percentages in the standard deviations of the flapwise root moment, the flapwise tip deflection and the root damage equivalent load, of about 30.0 %, 20.0 % and 20.0 %, respectively. Furthermore, the control effectiveness gradually lessened in the sequences of single, column, row and array cases, with successively increasing effective turbulence intensity, within regions II and III. The performances in region III, associated with the impaired flow separation on the blade by the effective pitching action, were much better than those in region II, related to enhanced flow detachment.

Performance levels/damage states, ranging from operational/undamaged to near collapse/severely damaged, are defined based on static pushover analyses. An example performance assessment is presented for an OWT supported by a jacket based on environmental conditions for a site off Massachusetts along U.S. Atlantic coast. The environmental conditions are characterized based on two methods for estimating wind and wave conditions, one on extrapolation of NOAA buoy measurements and one on a stochastic hurricane catalog, and two models for extreme wave height, one on the crest height and one on the zero-up-crossing height. Using probabilistic models for demands and capacities, two curves of fragility, one estimating the initiation of yielding and the other estimating the onset of collapse, are developed to distinguish between the three damage states. The curves are applied to four combinations of two environmental hazard models and two extreme wave height models, and significant differences are found in the probability of damage among the four combinations of models. The findings have potential implications for the evaluation of the overall risk profile and associated performance for offshore wind farms. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

The general finite element program ANSYS is used in the analysis. The different model vibration modes and vibration regularities of the master cylinder, the tube skirt and the anchor branches of the structure were all obtained. The structural harmonic response under loads of 0 similar to 130 Hz was simulated and discussed. Additionally, the original structure vibration response to wave loads was analyzed based on power spectrum density (PSD) method. Both transient dynamic response process and damageable parts were thoroughly studied, after two types of random loads (seismic and ice load) were applied on the structure.

Thus, the axial interaction between the pile and its surrounding soil is the key problem for the design of jacket foundation. In this paper, a novel t-z model was proposed to predict the pile responses under axial cyclic loadings. Model parameters were calibrated through cyclic interface shear tests, and then numerical studies were performed. The results indicate that the cyclic loading modes (two-way, one-way tension and one-way compression) and cyclic load amplitude have obvious effects on the pile axial responses, including accumulated pile displacement, pile axial force, pile-soil interface resistance. It is noted that the displacement of pile accumulates with a fast speed in the one-way cyclic tension mode. With the increase of load amplitude, the maximum residual axial force of pile increases downward significantly except for the shallow depth.

This paper vividly captures the fact that wind resource has a great potential to be fully explored and developed in the urban environment. Varying ways of application and application techniques being applied for electrical generation, ventilation and pollution dispersion, onshore cooling and dehumidification of coastal urban cities, and economics and environmental benefits of applying wind energy in urban environments are summarized. Although many new ideas and solutions that factor technical, economical and environmental sustainability in urban areas are coming up every day, challenges in design are gradually being solved to take advantage of urban low and turbulent wind speed characteristics, installation space challenges, vibration and noise reduction, among others.

The OFMWTP is attached to the sea bed using four identical non-linear catenary mooring cables. The potential flow diffraction/radiation theory is used for the hydrodynamic analysis of the structure. The hydrodynamic frequency response amplitude operators (RAOs), pressures, and motions are calculated using the potential flow diffraction/radiation model. These calculated parameters are subsequently used for finding time history responses of platform motions for surge, heave, and pitch and mooring tension forces in the hydrodynamic response module. The operating environmental conditions of the ocean are modeled using a JONSWAP (joint North Sea wave project) wavefield spectrum for representing the irregular waves.

So far, no EP&Ls have involved energy companies and none have involved wind energy or wind turbines. We perform an EP&L for three types of wind turbines sited and built in Northern Europe (Denmark and Norway) by a major manufacturer: a 3.2MW onshore turbine with a mixed concrete steel foundation, a 3.0MW offshore turbine with a steel foundation, and a 3.0MW offshore turbine with a concrete foundation. For each of these three turbine types, we identify and monetize externalities related to carbon dioxide emissions, air pollution, and waste. We find that total environmental losses range from (sic)1.1 million for the offshore turbine with concrete foundation to (sic)740,000 for onshore turbines and about (sic)500,000 for an offshore turbine with steel foundation-equivalent to almost one-fifth of construction cost in some instances. We conclude that carbon dioxide emissions dominate the amount of environmental damages and that turbines need to work for 2.5 to 5.5 years to payback their carbon debts. Even though turbines are installed in Europe, China and South Korea accounted for about 80% of damages across each type of turbine. Lastly, two components, foundations and towers, account for about 90% of all damages. We conclude with six implications for wind energy analysts, suppliers, manufacturers, and planners.

However, its power is difficult to harness due to the effect of environmental parameters which cause fault occurrences in the wind-turbine towers and decrease the efficiency of the system. We propose Flexible Threshold Selection and Fuzzy inference system based Fault Detection System (FTSFFDS), which allows autonomous and continuous monitoring of the wind farm in real-time and gives warnings in case of fault occurrences. This is a simple and efficient method which forms the basis for the structural health monitoring of Offshore wind-farms. The system uses WSN in offshore wind-farm to sense the parameters and transmit the readings to the remote observer. The method utilizes adaptive thresholds to cater to the readings at different times of the day. The decision for new threshold is made when the correlation between the datasets is low. The proposed method is efficient in reducing the overall size of the data packets transmitted by the sensor nodes and thus saving energy in the WSN. The simulations confirm that the energy efficiency of the system is increased by nearly ten times compared to standard protocols e.g. LEACH.

A relatively heavy load on the hub and blade was observed for the FOWT compared with the onshore wind turbine, leading to a 7.8% increase in the thrust curve; a 10% decrease in the power curve was also observed for the floating-type turbines, which could be attributed to the smaller project area and relative wind speed required for the rotor to receive wind power when the platform pitches.

This kinds of damage give rise to different difficulties due to economic losses and environmental pollution. On that account, the present paper deals with a special feature of a protective mechanism for offshore structures. We develop a numerical multiregional wave-structure impact model of a damping element prototype. The investigated prototype consists essentially of an elastic cover that is attached to the cylindrical mono-pile foundation at wave level. The chamber between the flexible structure and the mono-pile is filled with a liquid. A prototype of the damping element has been constructed as a mono-pile structure test object. In order to measure the hydrodynamic loads on the test object, we placed piezoelectric sensors on the stagnation points of the mono-pile. The multiregional simulation model created is able to imitate the wave impact and its consequences. These implications include the deformation and oscillation of the elastic shell, the resultant force affecting the pile and the dissipation power of the damping fluid. The dissipation power can be understood as the crucial factor preventing the shell from oscillating over long periods of time. It enables us to state the mechanical energy that is transfered due to the wave's impact on the damping fluid region.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,0948-4280,,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Kassel, Inst Mech, D-34125 Kassel, Germany",,,,2013-11-01,WOS:000324110700001,,

However, the erection of wind farms on the seabed may have considerable impacts on birds, namely local seabirds as well as waterbirds and terrestrial species that regularly cross the sea during migration or during foraging flights. There are two internationally important areas for seabirds and coastal birds off the German North Sea coast: the Eastern German Bight and the sea stretch seawards off the East Frisian Islands. Important areas along the Baltic coast comprise sea inlets in Mecklenburg-West Pomerania including the Szczecinski lagoon, Pomeranian Bay, as well as large parts of the Bight of Lubeck and Kiel Bay. Every year during migration, tens of millions of birds cross the North Sea and the Baltic Sea on their way from breeding grounds to wintering areas and back. Both seas are part of global flyway systems. The erection of wind facilities offshore can have the following adverse affects on birds: (1) risk of collision with wind turbines; (2) short-term habitat loss during construction; (3) long-term habitat loss due to disturbance by wind turbines including disturbances from sailing activities in connection with maintenance; (4) formation of barriers on migratory routes; and (5) disconnection of ecological units, such as roosting and feeding sites of local birds. To evaluate conflict potentials of individual parameters, we should know the distribution of birds at proposed wind plant locations and details of their behavior, in particular flight altitudes above sea level, perceptibility of wind turbines and species-specific sensitivities. To analyze the latter, elaborate behavioral investigations should be carried out on pilot wind power facilities. Methodological assessment standards and an assessment method for proposed wind farm sites are being developed within the scope of a project funded by the German Federal Environmental Agency. The environ- mental impact studies will comprise three major research complexes: (1) transect studies to analyze distribution and density of seabirds; (2) radar investigations; and (3) visual observations/flight call recordings to detect movements of passage migrants and foraging local birds. They should also include long-term comparative studies before and after installation of a wind farm as well as synchronous investigations in unaffected reference areas (BACI approach). Quality control regulations should be implemented. For a sound assessment of impacts of offshore wind farms on the marine environ- ment, it is vital that all potential construction sites are considered not individually, but as parts of an integral assessment framework, including their cable connections to the network on land, in the North Sea and the Baltic Sea respectively.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,0722-2947,,,,,,,,,,,"Institut fuer Vogelforschung Vogelwarte Helgoland, An der Vogelwarte 21, 26386 Wilhelmshaven, Germany",,,,2003-01-01,ZOOREC:ZOOR13900018175,,

The addition of artificial hard substrates (e.g. shipwrecks and wind turbine foundations) to soft-sediment sandy bottoms is a pervasive example of an anthropogenic habitat change. To investigate the importance of hard substrate habitats for demersal fish species, we studied the spatio-temporal variability for two commercially important species, Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) and pouting (Trisopterus luscus), from 2009 to 2011 at three different habitats in the Belgian part of the North Sea (BPNS), i.e. windmill artificial reefs (WARs), shipwrecks and sandy bottoms. Our results showed that population densities of both species were highly enhanced at the hard substrate habitats in comparison to the sandy sediments. The highest catch-per-unit effort values for both species were recorded around the WARs, which indicated distinct aggregation around the wind turbine foundations. In addition, the observed aggregation at the hard substrates differed between seasons. Highest population densities were observed in summer and autumn, i.e. the most intensive feeding period for both fishes.We conclude that the distribution and behaviour of Atlantic cod and pouting is affected by the presence and complexity of artificial hard substrates on the seabed.

In particular, less turbulent wind with higher average velocity enhances energy production and reduces structural fatigue of wind energy structures. In this study, benefits and drawbacks of off shore wind turbine units and power plants are pointed out.

Here, an investigation of the thermal regime and subsurface properties of a tidally affected, variably saturated streambed is presented. Field and laboratory measurements, as well as a forward numerical model, are jointly employed in the investigation. Temperature, soil moisture, surface level, and water level data were recorded in a transect perpendicular to a tidally driven stream. Frequency-domain analysis of the subsurface temperature measurements revealed the rapid decay of the tidal temperature driver within the top similar to 30 cm of sediment. Several techniques were used to evaluate subsurface thermal and hydraulic properties, including thermal conductivity and the soil water retention curve. These properties were used to constrain a forward numerical model that included coupled treatment of relevant variable saturation thermal and hydraulic physics.

Most of the hydrodynamic load models currently employed in designing offshore wind turbines take into account only indirectly the role of the wind. In fact, once the sea severity upon a certain wind speed is established, the sea state is fully determined by means of the significant wave height and the peak spectral period. In contrast, recent experimental results show that the local wind strongly influences the evolution of steep waves. A wind-waves energy transfer model is here implemented in a fully nonlinear potential flow model for wave-propagation. First, the laboratory experimental evidences about the influence of the wind on the propagation of steep waves are confirmed numerically by simulating the 2D propagation of a Gaussian wave packet. Second, real environmental conditions are reproduced in the near field of an offshore wind turbine using linear-nonlinear potential flow models within a novel coupling strategy. Different wind-wave relative speeds are simulated attempting to quantify the influence of the wind on the wave propagation. Although a reliable evaluation of this influence is still an open issue, the importance of some physical parameters, such as the duration of the energy transfer, is highlighted.

Initially, the wind speed and direction as well as its availability, duration and diurnal variation were assessed. For an analysis period of eight years, the mean wind speed at ten meters was determined as 3.8 m s(-1) with a small variation in monthly average wind speeds between 3.0 (January) and 4.4 m s(-1) (October). The mean wind power density was less than 200 W m(-2) at 10 m indicating the limiting suitability of the site for the usual renewable energy applications. However, life cycle analysis for wind turbine generators with lower cut-in, cut-out, and rated speeds revealed that the energy yield ratio can reach a value of six for a service life of 20 years while the energy pay-back period can be 3 years with 33 kt CO2-e of avoided greenhouse emissions. Therefore, the recent technological turbine improvements make wind power viable even at moderate wind fields. Moreover, the study of electricity supply of typical small hotel-apartments in the region of Western Greece indicated that the installation of 300 wind turbine generators in these moderate wind fields would cover the total consumption during the open touristic period with profits during the rest of the year.

Risk analysis can be used for selection and prioritization of maintenance activities, and risk-based decision makings have been given increased attention in recent years. This study identifies and reviews the few applied risk-based techniques in literature for maintenance of OWT farms and presents a comprehensive insight for managers into industry 4.0, common influential criteria, risk factors and advanced risk assessment techniques that could be applied for optimal risk-based maintenance strategies of OWTs.

This paper presents an investigation into optimal WT layout patterns for three OWF configurations (aligned, staggered, scattered) in HK (Hong Kong) waters. A hypothetical OWF (6930 m x 9072 m) are analysed based on twenty years of wind data (1992-2011). For the aligned and staggered WFs, different WT layout separations are studied. The separations varied between 5.0D and 15.0D along the PWD (prevailing wind direction) and 5.0D to 12.0D in the CWD (crosswind direction), where D is the WT rotor diameter. A range of 25 and 45 WTs are placed in the scattered WF, with their layout optimized using the Multi-Population Genetic Algorithm. WF performance is reported for the best ten layout patterns following studies of many different layouts. Results show for this hypothetical OWF, that the optimal WT separation is 14.5D in the PWD and 11.0D in the CWD for the aligned and staggered cases. Thirty WTs are recommended as the optimum number for the scattered WE The LCOE (levelized costs of energy) were calculated in HK$ terms 1.474/kWh (aligned), 1A67/kWh (staggered), and 1.290/kWh (scattered).

Research on its application is presented for offshore wind turbine towers. Kriging models are used to surrogate the complex time-domain stress-cycle fatigue assessment that demands multiple evaluations in the design phase.The presented development highlights the importance of having a notion of improvement for the problem of meta-modelling. Literature shows that, when meta-modelling complex engineering problems, the idea of improvement is not always considered. To tackle the problem of assessing fatigue in the design phase, a learning criterion is introduced. It has the particularity of relating to the physical description of the stress-cycle fatigue. Results of the proposed criterion are compared with meta-modelling using a Latin hypercube sampling, and with the standard design approach that bins environmental conditions for fatigue design calculations. A full 1 year validation sample is used to study convergence.As surrogate models for stress-cycle fatigue, Kriging models significantly decrease the efforts of the design procedure. Results showed that computational efforts can be reduced consistently by a factor of 5-8 without compromising accuracy. This may correspond to a reduction of up to approximately 85% of the effort needed to assess stress-cycle fatigue in the design phase.To conclude, it is important to highlight that the methodology presented has a universal character. It can be implemented to reduce computational time or assess the probabilistic response with only one requirement, the definition of a single representative indicator.

Herein, an efficient method for analysis of piled concrete foundations (PCFs) is presented, and the stability of PCF structures is evaluated under environmental conditions of the coast in Korea for a 3-MW wind turbine. Three analytical parameters for PCF models were defined to consider soil-structure interaction. The results of each model were compared with the displacement, stresses, and natural frequencies. Using the analysis results, a prestressing reinforcement design for concrete foundations was proposed. Quasi-static analysis showed that maximum displacement was sufficiently small and the maximum stresses did not exceed the allowable stresses. PCF showed excellent dynamic performance and structural stability. In addition, stiffness of the soil spring model influenced the natural frequency rather than the stiffness of the pile type.

To reduce the impact of scouring, several tons of rock/stone are usually placed around the foundations shortly after the installation of them. Such a measure is costly. Moreover, rock and stone may spread widely on the seabed during the long-term service period of OWTs. It has no doubt that recycling these rock and stone on the seabed is quite difficult in future decommission. For this reason, a new scour-countermeasure device (SEMCD) is proposed and studied in this paper. Considering that the major driver of scouring is horseshoe vortices around the monopile foundation, a hollow horn-like SEMCD with an arc surface profile is designed for weakening the horseshoe vortices. The SEMCD is made of either cement or other kinds of corrosion resistant materials. It is light in weight, and easy to install and decommission. In the paper, the working mechanism of the SEMCD is first explained. Then, its scouring mitigation effect (SME), i.e., its contribution to the reduction of horseshoe vortices and the mitigation of seabed erosion around the foundation, is studied through investigating its influences on down/up-flow and seabed shear stress. Finally, the optimal size of the SEMCD is discussed through investigating the impact of its size on the speeds of up and down flows and the shear stress on seabed surface. The calculation results have shown that the proposed SEMCD has great potential to prevent scouring and seabed erosion, so that it is of significance to improve the reliability of the monopile foundations of OWTs.",,,,,,,,,6,0,0,0,0,0,6,,,,1996-1073,,,,,,,,,,"Newcastle Univ, Sch Engn, Newcastle Upon Tyne NE1 7RU, Tyne & Wear, England",,,,2018-11-29,WOS:000449293500101,,

A solution is to deploy inexpensive large area electronics over strategic areas of the monitored component, analogous to sensing skin. The authors have previously proposed a large area electronic consisting of a soft elastomeric capacitor (SEC). The SEC is highly scalable due to its low cost and ease of fabrication, and can, therefore, be used for monitoring large-scale components. A single SEC is a strain sensor that measures the additive strain over a surface. Recently, its application in a hybrid dense sensor network (HDSN) configuration has been studied, where a network of SECs is augmented with a few off-the-shelf strain gauges to measure boundary conditions and decompose the additive strain to obtain unidirectional surface strain maps. These maps can be analyzed to detect, localize, and quantify faults. In this work, we study the performance of the proposed sensing skin at conducting condition evaluation of a wind turbine blade model in an operational environment. Damage in the form of changing boundary conditions and cuts in the monitored substrate are induced into the blade. An HDSN is deployed onto the interior surface of the substrate, and the blade excited in a wind tunnel.

In this study, we compared white-tailed eagle flight behavior both inside and outside of the Smola windpower plant on coastal Central Norway. During the eagle breeding period (mid-Mar-end May 2008), we collected data on flight activity (directional flight, social behavior, and soaring) and flight altitude (below, within, and above the rotor-swept zone [RSZ]) at 12 vantage points; 6 within the wind-power plant and 6 outside (control area). We found that white-tailed eagles did not show any clear avoidance flight responses to the wind turbines. Hence, we found no significant differences in the total amount of flight activity within and outside the power-plant area. However, we found less flight activity among adults than among subadults within the power plant compared with the control area. We also found a slightly increased probability of flight activity in the RSZ within the power plant, which obviously may increase the risk of collision with wind turbines. Our findings may help explain the relatively high mortality rate of white-tailed eagles in the windpower- plant area and the recorded peak in eagle fatalities during the breeding season.

To guarantee the normal operation of the wind turbine, the angular rotation of the foundation should be strictly controlled. It is necessary to predict the bearing capacity of caisson foundations at an allowable angular rotation. Several series of model tests were carried out in sandy silt under 1g gravity on suction caissons with different sizes subjected to overturning loading. The test results revealed the effect of the diameter, aspect ratio, and loading eccentricity on normalized moment capacity of caissons. The instantaneous rotation centers of model caissons were simplified to be at the depth of about four-fifths of the skirt length, almost directly below the lid center. Apart from the available ultimate moment capacity prediction approaches, a new calculation approach of deflection-based bearing capacity was proposed based on the mechanisms of soil-structure interaction and deflection of the caisson. Furthermore, determination of the model parameters is discussed. The present analytical approach can predict the moment-rotation curves of the model tests in silt and of the field test in a sand well. This deflection-based approach makes it possible to calculate bearing capacity at any allowable angular rotation. Further studies show that soil pressures and friction on the outer skirt at the passive zone contribute most to the moment capacity of the caisson, specifically the aspect ratio and the horizontal subgrade reaction constant. Finally, design charts of monocaisson foundations in silt and sand for offshore wind turbines are given.",,,,,,,,,44,4,0,0,0,0,44,,,1090-0241,1943-5606,,,,,,,,,,"Zhejiang Univ, Dept Civil Engn, Minist Educ MOE, Key Lab Soft Soils & Geoenvironm Engn, Hangzhou 310058, Zhejiang, Peoples R China",,,,2014-05-01,WOS:000334360600015,,

A first step in this assessment is to quantify overlap in space and time between MRE devices and prey species of top predators such as small pelagic fish.Here, we quantify how the distribution of fish schools overlaps with the operational depth (20-60 m) and tidal current speeds (>= 1.2-2.4 m/s) used by tidal kites, and the physical processes driving overlap.Fish schools undertake diel vertical migrations driven by the depth of light penetration into the water column, controlled by the supply of solar radiation and water column light absorption and scattering, which in turn depends on the cross-sectional area of suspended particulate matter (SPM). Fish schools were found shallower in the morning and evening and deeper in the middle of the day when solar radiation is greatest, with the deepest depths reached during predictable bimonthly periods of lower current speeds and lower cross-sectional area of SPM.Potential kite operations overlap with fish schools for a mean of 5% of the time that schools are present (maximum for a day is 36%). This represents a mean of 6% of the potential kite operating time (maximum for a day is 44%). These were both highest during a new moon spring tide and transitions between neap and spring tides.Synthesis and applications. Overlap of fish school depth distribution with tidal kite operation is reasonably predictable, and so the timing of operations could be adapted to avoid potential negative interactions. If all interaction between fish schools was to be avoided, the loss of operational time for tidal kites would be 6%. This information could also be used in planning the operating depths of marine renewable energy (MRE) devices to avoid or minimize overlap with fish schools and their predators by developers, and for environmental licencing and management authorities to gauge potential ecological impacts of different MRE device designs and operating characteristics.",,,,,,,,,9,0,0,0,4,0,9,,,0021-8901,1365-2664,,,,,,,,,,"Bangor Univ, Ctr Appl Marine Sci, Menai Bridge, Gwynedd, WalesBangor Univ, Sch Ocean Sci, Menai Bridge, Gwynedd, WalesCSIRO Oceans & Atmosphere, Castray Esplanade Battery Point, Hobart, Tas, AustraliaAlfred Wegener Inst, Helmholz Ctr Polar & Marine Res, Biol Anstalt Helgoland, Helgoland, Germany",,,,2020-03-10,WOS:000516534300001,,

Wind power systems have been installed in a number of locations in Alaska, both in remote areas and along the road system. As more isolated microgrids are developed worldwide, understanding the cost and performance of wind power in these systems is of increased importance. In this review of wind power project sizes and costs in Alaska, the costs per kilowatt for the different components of wind turbine installations generally were found to decrease with increasing sizes. Capacity factors ranged from approximately 10% to 40%, with variability from rated wind speeds, wind turbine heights, and the resolution of the wind power class map. Due to the size of communities in Alaska as well as other factors, turbines installed in Alaska are smaller than the trend in the larger market. Evidence indicates that installing overcapacity wind farms, together with energy storage and significant diversion into thermal loads, would allow communities to achieve diesel-off and least-cost energy when considering displacement of diesel fuel for both electricity and heat. However, the size of wind turbines that can be installed in Alaska is limited by the small size of the state's communities and the challenges of integrating high penetrations of wind power into microgrids. Demonstrations of different high-penetration wind power integration techniques are still needed.

Techniques have been developed recently to simplify the amount of effort needed to design to structural fatigue. This is the example of the usage of Kriging surrogate models. These may be used in OWTs design not only, to reduce the computational effort needed to analyse an OWT, but also to allow their design to be robust.Due to the stress variability and its non-linear character, the short-term fatigue damage variability is high, and converging the stochastic field approached by the surrogate model in relation to the real observations is challenging.A thorough analysis of the different components that load an OWT and are more critical for the tower component fatigue life is required, and therefore, presented and discussed in the current paper.The tower, jointly with the foundation, are particular components of the OWT regarding the fatigue analysis process.Statistical assessments of the extrapolation of fatigue loads for the tower and the influence of the environmental parameters in the short-term damage are presented in this paper. This sets a support analysis for the creation of the Kriging response surfaces for fatigue analysis. NREL's 5MW monopile turbine is used due to its state of the art character. Five environmental variables are considered in the analysis. A sensitivity analysis is conducted to identify which variables are most prominent in the quantification of the short-term damage uncertainty in the tower. The decoupling of the different external contributions for the fatigue life is a major contribution of the work presented. Preliminary guidelines are drawn for the creation of surrogate models to analyse fatigue of OWT towers and the most relevant conclusions are presented in an industry-oriented design outline regarding the most critical random variables that influence OWT short-term fatigue calculation.

The behaviour in operational and storm conditions without faults is provided as a base of comparison. They are followed by the responses to 50 year extreme values defined by the IEC standards, North Sea statistics, and Portugal's coastal storm data. All environmental conditions are head waves upwind sets, presumably causing minimal yaw excitation despite differing in wave excitation frequencies and maximum wind speeds. These scenarios are expanded further to cases where one of the pitch actuators stops functioning and fails to feather the blade. The result reveals large angle yaw motions of the platform. The reasoning behind this motion is explained and a possible method of mitigation through a revision of the HSS brake capacity is discussed. In this process, a frequently applied form of the hydrostatic matrix is reviewed as it includes overlooked coupling terms. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

A detailed evaluation of future wind characteristics over Greece is carried out using EURO-CORDEX RCA4 model data with a horizontal resolution of similar to 12 km, taking into consideration future RCP scenarios for the short term decadal climatology of 2040, which is the expected end-life of installed wind turbines. The RCA4 model demonstrated accurate performance when compared to actual observational data from the HNMS network, thus allowing higher confidence in assessments of future periods. Future projections revealed changes in the mean wind speed of the order of +/- 5% that did not vary significantly for the different RCP scenarios, although on a monthly basis that variability could reach +/- 20%. Decadal changes in the mean wind potential were of the order of +/- 15% for the two RCPs (2.6 and 8.5). Wind gusts exceeding 52 m/s, linked to the wind turbine structural integrity and robust performance, appeared more frequently in RCP 8.5 by about 2-4 times per decade, affecting mostly the South Ionian Sea.

An iterative design process is applied to baseline models with Froude scaling in order to achieve preliminary static stability. Structural dynamic analyses are performed to investigate the performance of the new model using a finite element method approach for the tower and a boundary integral equation (panel) method for the platform. The steady-state response of the system under uniform wind and regular waves is first studied to evaluate the performance of the integrated system. Response amplitude operators (RAOs) are computed in the time domain using white-noise wave excitation; this serves to highlight nonlinear, as well as dynamic characteristics of the system.

Compared to migratory birds and other more conspicuous migrants, we know very little about the movement patterns of many migratory bats. Hoary bats (Lasiurus cinereus), a cryptic, wide-ranging, long-distance migrant, comprise a substantial proportion of the tens to hundreds of thousands of bat fatalities estimated to occur each year at wind turbines in North America. We created seasonally-dynamic species distribution models (SDMs) from 2,753 museum occurrence records collected over five decades in North America to better understand the seasonal geographic distributions of hoary bats. We used 5 SDM approaches: logistic regression, multivariate adaptive regression splines, boosted regression trees, random forest, and maximum entropy and consolidated outputs to generate ensemble maps. These maps represent the first formal hypotheses for sex-and season-specific hoary bat distributions. Our results suggest that North American hoary bats winter in regions with relatively long growing seasons where temperatures are moderated by proximity to oceans, and then move to the continental interior for the summer. SDMs suggested that hoary bats are most broadly distributed in autumn-the season when they are most susceptible to mortality from wind turbines; this season contains the greatest overlap between potentially suitable habitat and wind energy facilities. Comparing wind-turbine fatality data to model outputs could test many predictions, such as 'risk from turbines is highest in habitats between hoary bat summering and wintering grounds'.

Breaking waves and their associated impact loads are challenging to model because the breaking process is a strongly non-linear phenomenon with significant statistical scattering. Given the challenges and uncertainty in modeling breaking waves, there is a need for comparing existing models with simultaneous environmental and structural measurements taken from utility-scale OWTs exposed to breaking waves. Overall, such measurements are lacking; however, one exception is the Offshore Wind Turbines at Exposed Sites project, which recorded sea state conditions and associated structural loads for a 2.0 MW OWT supported by a monopile and located at the Blyth wind farm off the coast of England. Measurements were recorded over a 17 month campaign between 2001 and 2003, a period that included a storm that exposed the instrumented OWT to dozens of breaking waves. This paper uses the measurements from this campaign to categorize and identify breaking waves and quantify the variability of their impact loads. For this particular site and turbine, the distribution of measured mudline moments due to breaking waves has a mean of 8.7 MN-m, a coefficient of variation of 26% and a maximum of 14.9 MN-m. The accuracy of several breaking wave limits and impact force models is compared with the measurements, and the impact force models are shown to represent the measurements with varying accuracy and to be sensitive to modeling assumptions.

The modified method considers the variability of the responses by checking multiple contour surfaces so that the non-monotonic aerodynamic behaviour of the wind turbine is considered.

This study investigates the structural strength of a tri-floater floating foundation supporting a 2.6 MW Darrieus VAWT. Finite element models of the floating foundation were developed using space plate-beam elements. The environmental loads, such as the aerodynamic loads, static wind loads, and wave-current loads, were considered. The general strengths of the floating foundation were calculated for the normal operating case (a cut-out wind speed of 25 m s(-1) and blade rotation of 12 r min(-1) were used to analyze the most unfavorable loads) and an extreme case (wind speed of 40 m s(-1) and parked blades), and the weak components of the structure were analyzed. The results show that the floating foundation meets the strength requirements and the structural stress is highest when the wave, wind, and current are in a collinear direction. The main and secondary supporting bars transmit the loads between the stand columns and the tower foundation, and their stresses are higher than those in the other components. In the actual design, these supporting bars should be strengthened.

Related risk assessment is fundamentally dependent on the estimation of hurricane-generated wind speed exceedance probabilities at selected hub heights of wind turbines in the plant and on estimation of associated wind turbine loads. As part of a framework for risk assessment introduced here, synthetic storm tracks are first simulated over the ocean using available historical tropical storm data; then, a hurricane intensity evolution model based on thermodynamic and atmospheric environmental variables is developed for each simulated track as it approaches the chosen wind plant site. Based on this intensity model, a turbulent wind field can be simulated at any location of interest along the hurricane track. The simulated turbulent wind field can then be used to estimate wind speed exceedance probability distributions and, when combined with partially correlated waves, it can also be used in analyzing the response of individual turbines in a wind plant. A framework for the overall risk assessment is presented; individual components that are part of such a framework are described briefly in illustrative applications. Finally, a brief discussion is presented that addresses issues related to the concept of robustness checks that are often considered in the context of safe performance-based design. This concept employed in the oil and gas industries provides for a secondary margin for beyond design-level external conditions out to more extreme conditions as might accompany hurricanes.",,,,,,,,,8,0,0,0,1,0,8,,,0309-524X,2048-402X,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Texas Austin, Dept Civil Architectural & Environm Engn, Austin, TX 78712 USA",,,,2016-06-15,WOS:000376381500006,,

Lattice towers might be a competitive solution for OWTs due to less physical impact from waves and less concern for visual impact. This paper addresses the design methodology of lattice towers for OWTs in the ultimate limit state and presents a FEM code that has been developed to implement this methodology. The structural topologies are specified in terms of tower cross-section geometry, the inclination of bracings, and the number of segments along the tower height. For each topology a series of towers is designed in which the bottom distance between the legs has been varied; the resulting tower mass is evaluated as a major parameter for the cost assessment. The study was conducted using the NREL 5-MW baseline wind turbine for an offshore site at a water depth of 35 m. The optimal design is searched for according to tower mass and fabrication complexity. The most economical tower geometry appears to have a constant inclination of bracing owing to its simplicity of fabrication and strong antitorsion capacity. Three-legged and four-legged alternatives have different advantages, the former having simpler geometry and the latter offering better torsion resistance. As a design driver for offshore steel structures, the fatigue life of the towers designed in the ultimate limit state should be assessed and the structures are consequently modified, if necessary. However, fatigue assessment is out of the scope of this paper and will be done in a later work.

About 85% of existing offshore wind turbines are supported using monopile foundations, which are made of large welded plates. The locked in residual stresses in a monopile structure have a great impact on its fatigue life. The new emerged technology of additive manufacturing (AM), which is widely used in other industries such as aerospace and automotive, has the potential to significantly improve a lifespan of the structure by managing the residual stress fields and microstructure in the future monopiles, and moreover reduce the manufacturing cost. In order to achieve this goal, new materials that are used for additive manufacturing parts fabrication and their behaviour in the harsh marine environment and under operational loading conditions need to be understood. Also purely welding fabrication technique employed during AM process is likely to significantly affect crack growth behaviour in air as well as in seawater. This paper presents a review of additive manufacturing technology and suitable techniques for offshore structures. Existing literature that reports current data on fracture toughness and fatigue crack growth tests conducted on AM parts is summarised and analysed, highlighting different steel grades and applications, with the view to illustrating the requirements for the new optimised functionally graded structures in offshore wind structures by means of AM technique.

OWTs are dynamically sensitive structures subject to an interaction with a control unit exposed to repeated cyclic wind and wave loads causing deterioration and fatigue. This study focuses on the quantification of the value of structural and environmental information on the integrity management of OWT structures, with the focus on fatigue of welded joints. By utilizing decision analysis, structural reliability methods, measurement data, as well as the cost-benefit models, a Value of Information (VoI) analysis can be performed to quantify the most beneficial measurement strategy. The VoI assessment is demonstrated for the integrity management of a butt welded joint of a monopile support structure for a 3 MW OWT with a hub height of approximately 71m. The conditional value of three-year measured oceanographic information and one-year strain monitoring information is quantified posteriori in conjunction with an inspection and repair planning.

It is a pre-fabricated cross-shaped structure which rests on the seabed through four skirted plates. The geotechnical performance of the foundation has been analysed numerically with respect to both capacity and displacement during extreme loading and normal operation. The effects of different geometrical aspects such as skirt length and structural stiffness have been studied by means of 2D and 3D Finite Element simulations. Fully coupled stress equilibrium and pore water flow simulations have been performed in order to analyse the influence of accumulated excess pore pressure due to cyclic loading. The long-term behaviour of the foundation is discussed based on stability and failure considerations. The results of the numerical study show that the proposed foundation solution offers a viable alternative as a safe foundation for offshore wind turbines. This has been demonstrated representatively for a 5 MW wind turbine installed in a water depth of 35 m on homogeneous ground subjected to the governing design load cases.,,,,,,,,,3,0,0,0,0,0,3,,,0172-6145,2190-6653,,,,,,,,,,"NGI, POB 3930, N-0806 Oslo, Norway",,,,2011-06-01,WOS:000447106700002,,

The OWT used for the analysis is 5-MW National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) baseline model in 20 m water depth. Initially, the analysis considering variability in wave characteristics was done due to computational cost by performing three different approaches: analytical approach using Morison's Equation; Finite Element Analysis (FEA) approach; and Computer Aided Engineering (CAE) tool using Fatigue, Aerodynamics, Structures, and Turbulence (FAST) approach. The results coupled with First Order Reliability Method (FORM) were used to develop wave fragility curves, indicating that the FAST approach resulted in a reasonable conservative range in the fragility curve. The FAST approach was further used to simulate wind-and-wave hazard vulnerability of the OWT. To that end, extreme loading scenarios specified by the International Electro-technical Commission (IEC) Design Standard was utilized. Structural responses of the OWT captured at various locations, resulted in flexural demands at the mudline to be critical, and was used to create the multi-hazard fragility surface. This study found that the exceedance probability increased with an increase in both wind speed and wave height, especially above 12 m/s and 10 m, respectively.

Additionally, there is now significant encouragement globally towards the deployment of more offshore renewable wind turbines and wave devices and the requirement for underwater inspection can be expected to increase significantly in the coming years. While the merit of image processing based assessment of the condition of underwater structures is understood to a certain degree, there is no existing protocol on such image based methods. This paper discusses and describes an image processing protocol for underwater inspection of structures. A stereo imaging image processing method is considered in this regard and protocols are suggested for image storage, imaging, diving, and inspection.

To solve this problem, in this paper, a novel power optimization model is developed based on the aerodynamic characteristics of the wind in contact with the turbines.

The proposed optimal power extraction (OPE) strategy can achieve the maximum power generation, and at the same time limit the excess power output to enhance operational safety.

Time domain analyses are the best way to determine a representative fatigue damage under a wide-banded process, but the time domain analysis can be computationally expensive. This paper reports a functional relationship between the environmental conditions and probability density function (PDF) of tension distribution using an Artificial Neural Network (ANN), which can be used to reduce computational cost with reasonable accuracy when compared to the time domain approach. The predictive accuracy of the fatigue damage under wide banded process is dependent on how well the PDF of the process is defined. This study addresses three approaches in expressing the distributions: superposition of multiple Gaussian distribution functions (Superposition approach), direct prediction of the distributions (Piecewise approach), and nth-order moments of the distributions (Moment approach). A full-scale floating offshore wind turbine (FOWT) platform was used for the target structure with three catenary mooring lines. The sea state data collected from the Jeju offshore area in Korea were used as the input data for the time-domain mooring dynamics analyses of the FOWT as well as input neurons of the three multi-layered ANN models. The tension distributions in each mooring line were used for the three types of output neurons in terms of the PDF parameters for the Superposition approach, a certain number of distribution points for the Piecewise approach, and moment values for the Moment approach. The accuracy of each trained ANN was verified by comparing the predictions by the trained ANN with the hydrodynamic simulation results for the newly defined load cases.

In the ocean environment, in addition to threats related to scour of the foundation, offshore monopiles of wind turbines also are subjected to lateral vibrations induced by waves and winds. Over the past decades, the scour process induced by flow and pile-soil interactions has been independently investigated by researchers from the fields of hydraulic/coastal engineering and soil mechanics, respectively. Very few studies can be found in the published literature on lateral vibration effects on scour at monopile foundations. The objective of this experimental study is to improve understanding of the mechanics of current-induced scour at monopiles subjected to lateral vibrations with a non cohesive bed. When compared to a non-vibrating monopile, the results show that scouring around its vibrating counterpart is comparatively faster during the first few hours of the test. This is primarily due to soil densification and the subsidence process induced by monopile-seabed interactions. Increasing both the frequency and amplitude of the monopile vibration would decrease the equilibrium scour depths and scour hole slopes. The reduction of equilibrium scour depth likely is due to the effect of sediment ratcheting motions on the surface of the scour hole.

Here we present Landsat-8 imagery that reveals the impact of offshore wind farms on suspended sediments. Turbid wakes of individual turbines are observed that are aligned with tidal currents. They are 30-150 m wide, and several km in length. The environmental impact of these wakes and the source of the suspended material are still unclear, but the wake size warrants further study. The underwater light field will be affected by increased suspended sediments and the turbid wakes could significantly impact sediment transport and downstream sedimentation.

Elastic lateral dynamic impedance functions have a defining influence on the natural frequencies of offshore wind turbines supported on cylindrical shell type foundations, such as suction caissons, bucket foundations, and monopiles. This paper considers the coupled horizontal and rocking vibration of a cylindrical shell type foundation embedded in a fully saturated poroelastic seabed in contact with a seawater half-space. The formulation of the coupled seawater-shell-seabed vibration problem is simplified by treating the shell as a rigid one. The rigid shell vibration problem is approached by the integral equation method using ringload Green's functions for a layered seawater-seabed half-space. By considering the boundary conditions at the shell-soil interface, the shell vibration problem is reduced to Fredholm integral equations. Through an analysis of the corresponding Cauchy singular equations, the intrinsic singular characteristics of the problem are rendered explicit. With the singularities incorporated into the solution representation, an effective numerical method involving Gauss-Chebyshev method is developed for the governing Fredholm equations. Selected numerical results for the dynamic contact load distributions, displacements of the shell, and lateral dynamic impedance functions are examined for different shell length-radius ratio, poroelastic materials, and frequencies of excitation.

It is a necessary that appropriate local design criteria should be designated as soon as possible because there were significant differences on horizontal deflections; Pf was 60% at a minimum criteria 15mm deflection,however, 1.5% Pf when 60mm deflection using 1% of pile diameter from local design criterion standard. Finally, friction angle of sand among many design variables was found most influential design factor in OWT monopile design, and a sensitivity analysis is found an important process to understand which design variables can mostly reduce Pf with a optimum design for maintaining OWT stability.",,,,"응답면 기법(RSM)을 이용하여 해상풍력(OWT) 모노파일에 대한 신뢰성 해석을 수행하였다. 모노파일은 해수면으로부터 15m 깊이에 설치되고 사질토에 근입되는 조건으로 고려하였다. 풍하중 및 파랑하중과 같은 해양환경하중이 작용하는 OWT 모노파일에 대한 신뢰성 해석은KIOST에서 개발된 신뢰성 해석프로그램인 HSRBD를 이용하였다.

In addition to the analysis of the wind resources (reported for a 100 m height), the performances of several wind turbines, ranging from 3 to 9.5 MW, were evaluated. From the analysis of the spatial maps it was observed that the Northern part of this region presents significant wind resources, the mean wind speed values exceeding 9 m/s in some locations. On the other hand, in regard to the Southern sector, more energetic conditions are visible close to the Strait of Gibraltar and to the Gulf of Lion. Nevertheless, from the analysis of the data corresponding to these two Southern nearshore points it was observed that the average wind speed was lower than 8 m/s in both summer and winter months. Regarding the considered wind turbines, the capacity factor did in general not exceed 20%-however, we did observe some peaks that could reach to 30%. Finally, it can be highlighted that the Northern part of the Spanish continental nearshore is significant from the perspective of extracting offshore wind energy, especially considering the technologies based on floating platforms.

Such bottom-supported turbines are confined to shallow waters closer to the shore. Sites farther offshore provide a better wind resource (i.e., stronger wind and less turbulence) while also reducing concerns related to visual impact and noise. However, in deeper waters, bottom-supported turbines are less economical. Wind turbines mounted atop floating platforms are, thus, being considered for deepwater sites. Several floating platform concepts are being considered; they differ mainly in how they provide stability to counter the large mass of the rotor-nacelle assembly located high above the water. One of these alternative concepts is a spar buoy floating platform with a deep draft structure and a low center of gravity, below the center of buoyancy. The reliability analysis of a spar-supported 5MW wind turbine based on stochastic simulation is the subject of this study. Environmental data from a selected deepwater reference site are employed in the numerical studies. Using time-domain simulations, the dynamic behavior of the coupled platform-turbine system is studied; statistics of tower and rotor loads as well as platform motions are estimated and critical combinations of wind speed and wave height identified. Long-term loads associated with a 50-year return period are estimated using statistical extrapolation based on loads derived from the simulations. Inverse reliability procedures that seek appropriate load fractiles for the underlying random variables consistent with the target return period are employed; these include use of: (i) the 2D Inverse First-Order Reliability Method (FORM) where an extreme load is selected at its median level (conditional on a derived critical wind speed and wave height combination); and (ii) the 3D Inverse FORM where variability in the environmental and load random variables is fully represented to derive the 50-year load.",,,,,"30th International Conference on Ocean, Offshore and Arctic Engineering30th International Conference on Ocean, Offshore and Arctic Engineering","JUN 19-24, 2011JUN 19-24, 2011","ASME, Ocean Offshore & Arctic Engn DivASME, Ocean Offshore & Arctic Engn Div","Rotterdam, NETHERLANDSRotterdam, NETHERLANDS",1,1,0,0,0,0,1,,,,,978-0-7918-4437-3,,,,,,,,,"Univ Texas Austin, Dept Civil Architectural & Environm Engn, Austin, TX 78712 USA",,,,2011-01-01,WOS:000314736400092,,

We therefore installed acoustic bat detectors at wind turbines in the Belgian part of the North Sea. Seven detectors were installed on the service platform of the transition piece (16 m above mean sea level) and four were installed on the nacelle of the turbines, in the centre of the rotor swept area (93 m above mean sea level). A total of 151 recordings of call sequences of Pipistrellus nathusii (Nathusius' pipistrelle) were made during 20 nights over an entire autumn migration season (8 August - 30 November 2017). 45 recordings contained more than 10 calls.

Only three detections contained feeding buzzes and/or intense exploratory behaviour. The number of recordings at 93 m were around 10% of the number of recordings made at 16 m. This indicates that the activity of P. nathusii at our study site, measured at that particular altitude is low. Our observations therefore suggest that the collision risk might be lower than what could be expected from low altitude observations.

Both types of loads contribute to fatigue life progression and thus define the turbine's age. As a structural health monitoring solution, one could thus directly measure the stress history at fatigue critical locations. However, for OWTs on monopile foundations some fatigue critical locations are located below the seabed. Installing strain sensors at these hotspots is therefore impossible for existing wind turbines. This measurement restriction is overcome by reconstructing the full-field response of the structure based on the limited number of accelerometers and strain sensors (installed at a few easily accessible locations) and a calibrated finite element model of the system. The system model uses a multi-band modal expansion approach constituted of the quasi-static and dynamic contributions. These contributions are superimposed to reconstruct the stress history at all degrees of freedom of the finite element model, and the subsequent assess fatigue life consumption at all fatigue hot spots of the OWT. In this paper, the proposed virtual sensing technique is validated by predicting the stresses in the transition piece with 12 days of consecutive measurements from an operational OWT. The data set contains both variations in environmental and operating conditions as well as extreme events.

Unfortunately, slippage of the transition piece over the monopile has been observed in many foundations, threatening the long-term stability of the structure. Several utilities have arrested the slippage by welding restraints inside the foundation to transfer the axial loads from the tower to the monopile foundation; however, bending moments are still transferred through the grouted section. If the grout degrades in service then the turbine could still be at risk. An inspection technique is therefore necessary so that foundations can be prioritised for repair. A novel solution is required as conventional NDT techniques either cannot find the conditions of concern or deployment in an offshore environment is hazardous. The approach taken has been to use a swept frequency ultrasonic technique operating below 100 kHz, so that resonances characteristic of the structure and its various fault conditions can be mapped.

A 17-degree-of-freedom (17-DOF) aero-hydro-servo-elastic model for the FOWT is first established using multi-body-based formulation and the Euler-Lagrangian equation, taking into consideration the full coupling of the blade-drivetrain-tower-spar vibrations, a collective pitch controller and a generator controller. The outputs of the model are compared with FAST for model verification. Next, a reduced-order 5-DOF model is established for the TLCD-controlled FOWT in-plane vibrations including hydrodynamic added mass as well as stiffness contributions from mooring lines and buoyancy. The model enables revealing the fundamental mechanism of the coupled spar-tower-TLCD system, as well as an efficient procedure for optimal design of FOWT-mounted TLCD. It is found from modal analysis of the spar-tower system that due to the coupling to the spar roll motion, the tower side-side frequency is significantly shifted comparing with the decoupled case, which needs to be accounted for when tuning the TLCD. Based on the 5-DOF model, a frequency-domain (FD) method for TLCD optimization is proposed using random vibration theory, and robust optimization of the TLCD can be performed for given environmental conditions.

Recently, tripod suction bucket foundation is rapidly expanding as a foundation system supporting the offshore wind turbine. In offshore environment, wind turbine foundation structures should be designed considering cyclic loading which can lead to permanent deformation of structure, tilting problem, and overall degradation of soil stiffness. However, it is technically difficult to predict the cyclic behavior of the tripod accurately because the cyclic behaviors of the tripod bucket can be inferred from vertical pullout and compression behaviors of each single bucket elements. In this paper, a series of model tests was performed by applying cyclic vertical compression and extension loadings to a single bucket element that is one element of the tripod foundation. Loading directions, level, and rate were controlled for investigating of cyclic behavior of tripod foundation. On the basis of testing results, the permanent deformation and cyclic stiffness response of tripod suction caisson were discussed. Based on the test results, it was confirmed that the cyclic behavior of the single bucket is affected by the load level and rate.

Accurate load prediction depends on proper modeling of the wind turbulence and the wave stochastic processes as well as of the turbine, the support structure, and the foundation. One method for modeling the support structure is to rigidly connect it to the seabed; such a foundation model is appropriate only when the sea floor is firm (as is the case for rock). To obtain realistic turbine response dynamics for softer soils, it is important that a flexible foundation is modeled. While a single discrete spring for coupled lateral/rotational motion or several distributed springs along the length of the monopile may be employed, a tractable alternative is to employ a fictitious fixed-based pile modeled as an equivalent cantilever beam, where the length of this fictitious pile is determined using conventional pile lateral load analysis in combination with knowledge of the soil profile.The objective of this study is to investigate the influence of modeling flexible pile foundations on offshore wind turbine loads such as the fore-aft tower bending moment at the mudline. We employ a utility-scale 5MW offshore wind turbine model with a 90-meter hub height in simulations; the turbine is assumed to be sited in 20 meters of water. For a critical wind-wave combination known to control long-term design loads, we study time histories, power spectra, response statistics, and probability distributions of extreme loads for fixed-base and flexible foundation models with the intention of assessing the importance of foundation model selection. Load distributions are found to be sensitive to foundation modeling assumptions. Extrapolation to rare return periods may be expected to lead to differences in derived nominal loads needed in ultimate limit state design; this justifies the use of flexible foundation models in simulation studies.",,,,,27th International Conference on Offshore Mechanics and Arctic Engineering27th International Conference on Offshore Mechanics and Arctic Engineering,"JUN 15-20, 2008JUN 15-20, 2008","ASME, Ocean, Offshore, & Arct Engn DivASME, Ocean, Offshore, & Arct Engn Div","Estoril, PORTUGALEstoril, PORTUGAL",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,978-0-7918-4823-4,,,,,,,,,"Univ Texas Austin, Austin, TX 78712 USA",,,,2008-01-01,WOS:000263581700088,,

The soil was modeled as an elastic foundation, and the added mass was calculated using the Added mass method to determine the effects of water surrounding the support structure. To evaluate the feasibility of the PCF, quasi-static analysis, natural frequency analysis and seismic analysis were performed using environmental conditions at the Southwest Coast of Korea. In quasi-static analysis, the lateral displacement did not exceed the allowable displacement, and natural frequency analysis confirmed the superiority of the dynamic behavior of the PCF. Seismic evaluation through response spectrum analysis and time-history analysis demonstrated that the PCF is safe.

Surface water waves experience frequency shifts and wave shape modification when traveling on underlying currents. The wave-current interactions are known to be important for the responses of offshore structures, however, they have not been considered in FOWT fatigue analysis. To include such interactions, a nonlinear mooring hydrodynamics model is presented which is able to consider the cable geometric nonlinearity, seabed contact, and the current effect. The mooring model is then coupled with a spar-type FOWT model which simulates the structural dynamics of turbine blades and tower; aerodynamics of the wind-blade interaction and wave-current actions on the spar. Analytical wave-current interaction models based on Airy's theory considering the current effect are applied for generating the flow field. Based on a spar-type FOWT and the wave-current interaction model, numerical simulations have been performed for three cases with only waves, wave and current without and with interactions. The comparison of the structural responses shows that the current and the wave-current interaction can have significant influences on FOWT tower and cable responses. Furthermore, cable fatigue life is estimated for two particular cases when the cable tension is decreased and increased respectively due to the presence of current.

Recent research shows that under cyclic loading, most soils change their properties. Discrete Element Modelling of cyclic simple shear tests was performed using PFC2D to analyse the micromechanics underlying the cyclic behaviours of soils. The DEM simulation were first compared with previous experimental results. Then asymmetric one-way and two-way cyclic loading pattern attained from real offshore wind farms were considered in the detailed parametric study. The simulation results show that the shear modulus increases rapidly in the initial loading cycles and then the rate of increase diminishes; the rate of increase depends on the strain amplitude, initial relative density and vertical stress. It shows that the change of soil behaviour is strongly related to the variation of coordination number, rotation of principal stress direction and evolution of degree of fabric anisotropy. Loading asymmetry only affects soil behaviours in the first few hundred of cycles. In the long term, the magnitude of (gamma(max)-gamma(min)) rather than loading asymmetry dominates the soil responses. Cyclic loading history may change the stress-strain behaviour of a soil to an extent dependent on its initial relative density.",,,,,,,,,6,0,0,0,0,0,6,,,1434-5021,1434-7636,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Surrey, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Guildford GU2 7XH, Surrey, EnglandUniv Windsor, Fac Engn, Windsor, ON N9B 1K3, Canada",,,,2019-08-02,WOS:000476607000003,,

The purpose of this paper is to show that a climbing robot that can perform in situ blade inspection with micro/nano focus computed axial X-ray tomography is a solution to find defects in the thickest blade sections and reduce the cost of inspection.Design/methodology/approach - The weight of such an inspection system will be high, typically 200 kg and cross sectional scanner dimensions of 1 x 2 m to envelope a blade. The design of a climbing ring robot that completely encircles a turbine tower, typically 3 In in diameter, will provide the best means of climbing with this payload. Because of the development costs of such a huge robot, the optimal design path is to first prototype a small scale model.Findings - First results on such a model are described and from its performance the load carrying capabilities of a full scale version computed. The robot is able to climb either straight up or down, or with a spiralling motion, or rotate around the circumference at the same height. Furthermore, the design is entirely modular thus enabling easy on-site assembly of the robot.Originality/value - A climbing robot with high payload and versatile motion capability, with adhesive forces between the robot and climbing surface provided entirely by mechanical means rather than by vacuum suction or magnetic force, making the system much safer and easier to manipulate.",,,,,11th International Conference on Climbing and Walking Robots (CLAWAR 2008)11th International Conference on Climbing and Walking Robots (CLAWAR 2008),"SEP 08-10, 2008SEP 08-10, 2008",,"Coimbra, PORTUGALCoimbra, PORTUGAL",28,1,0,0,0,0,32,,,0143-991X,,,,,,,,,,,"London S Bank Univ, Dept Elect Comp & Commun Engn, London, EnglandLondon S Bank Univ, Ctr Automated & Robot NDT, Fac Engn Sci & Built Environm, London, England",,,,2009-01-01,WOS:000268219200004,,

The mooring line consists of three portions: the embedded portion, the lying portion and the suspended portion. Previous studies ignore the embedded and lying portion, and assume the lower end of the suspended chain is fixed at the touchdown point on the seabed. However, the effect of the chain-seabed interaction plays a more important role, especially in the dynamic response of the mooring chain. This article proposes a numerical model for the dynamic response of the mooring chain, considering the dynamic interaction between the mooring chain and the clay and sand sediment. Firstly, the configuration and tension of the mooring chain under monotonic motion of the fairlead are verified against the static model and then the response of the chain under cyclic horizontal drift and vertical heave of the floating facility is investigated. It was found that the chain gradually digs into the deeper soil and become straightened within a few cycles. The dig-in effect leads to the cyclic degradation of the mooring chain tensions and uplift angle at the padeye. The development in the configuration, tension, and angle of the mooring chain under horizontal and vertical motion in clay and sand sediments are compared in this study in order to give practical advice.

The species studied in those case studies were jellyfish in marine lakes, corals in acidified bays, seagrass, mangrove propagules, mussels and oysters, prawns, some estuarine fish larvae, the copepod Calanus finmarchius in the North Sea, sea turtles in the Coral Sea, and the ornate spiny lobster Panulirus ornatus in the Southeast Asia archipelago. The spatial scales for self recruitment and connectivity vary with the species from a few m to 10,000 km, and the temporal scales vary from one to three generations. These studies suggest that, with increasing physical openness of a given site for a given species, self-recruiting increasingly relies on the behaviour of the species. Estuarine and coastal systems thus are simultaneously bounded and unbounded depending on the sites and the species considered and, although often ignored, the integration of oceanographic and behavioural understanding is increasingly required. This paper has shown the importance of understanding the hydrological and ecological dynamics with unbounded boundaries in creating the connectivity between parts of the aquatic continuum from the river catchment to the open seas.

Here we use a diverse set of analysis tools from the atmospheric science, economic and legal communities to assess costs and consequences of these wake effects, focusing on a West Texas case study. We show that although wake effects vary with atmospheric conditions, they are discernible in monthly power production. In stably stratified atmospheric conditions, wakes can extend 50+ km downwind, resulting in economic losses of several million dollars over six years for our case study.

This work presents a technique that uses readily available measurements to estimate signals that would otherwise require additional instrumentation. This study presents a digital twin concept with a focus on estimating wind speed, thrust, torque, tower-top position, and loads in the tower using supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) measurements. The model combines a linear state-space model obtained using OpenFAST linearizations, a wind speed estimator, and a Kalman filter algorithm that integrates measurements with the state model to perform state estimations. The measurements are: top acceleration, generator torque, pitch, and rotational speed. The article extends previous work that derived the linear state-space model using a different method. The new implementation, based on OpenFAST linearization capability, allows for a systematic extension of the method to more states, inputs, outputs, and to the offshore environment. Results from the two methods are compared, and the validation is made with additional measurements using the GE 1.5-MW turbine located at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory test site.

In sand, suction-induced seepage flow reduces effective stresses at the skirt tips, which decreases penetration resistance. However, layered seabeds are often encountered in areas of offshore wind farm development. The effect of the presence of a clay layer on the suction-induced seepage flow in the sand layer is not well understood. Therefore in this study, the effects of a clay layer on suction bucket installation in dense sand was investigated. This was achieved by analyzing images of a half-bucket installed against a Perspex window. The images were captured during tests performed in a geotechnical centrifuge, such that the stress levels are realistic and relevant to field conditions.

J,,,,,,,,,Matthew Lewis,,"Improving Methods of Characterising Resource, Interactions and Conditions (METRIC)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Awarded Grant,Jun 28 2018,2018,"Electricity can be generated through the conversion of the kinetic energy that resides in tidal currents in a similar way to a wind turbine. The ubiquitous nature of tidal energy, and the predictability and reliability of tidal currents, gives tidal-stream energy distinct advantages compared to other renewable energy technologies. Individual tidal energy devices have been installed and proven, with commercial arrays planned throughout the world. Yet, the true global resource and ocean conditions are broadly unknown, affecting optimal global device design. Present methods are unsuitable as the industry matures beyond the fast, shallow, well-mixed, and wave sheltered demonstration sites - influencing investor confidence. Transformative understanding of this sustainable natural resource for the coming century is therefore needed to bring a step change towards a sustainable, high-tech and globally exportable, UK renewable energy industry. CHALLENGE 1: How much tidal energy is there in the world and how is it distributed? OBJECTIVE 1: Resolve the true tidal-stream energy resource using unique datasets, consistent modelling framework, and state-of-the-art modelling techniques.Global tidal resource assessments are based on coarse, data constrained, models that are not validated for the few tidal energy sites resolved, as developed for other applications (e.g. global energy budgets); therefore, the global tidal energy resource is only broadly known. Fine-scale bathymetric constrictions (e.g. coral reef passes), biological communities (e.g. flow diverted around kelp beds) and ocean currents, can all accelerate currents between constrictions; meaning many sites initially dismissed as commercially unviable may actually be suitable. A consistent modelling framework (e.g. resolution and physics), and comparison of modelling techniques, will be developed to reduce bias and determine the potential global resource. CHALLENGE 2: How do conditions vary globally and will this change in the coming century? OBJECTIVE 2: Realistic oceanographic conditions at potential tidal-stream energy sites for the coming century will be determined For sustainable device design, realistic oceanographic conditions must be characterised for the lifetime of deployments, and cascaded through high-fidelity device-scale models (e.g. CFD); yet oceanographic conditions, and the impact of climate change, at tidal energy sites is largely unknown. Previously unviable tidal energy regions may become economically viable in the future (as near-resonant tidal systems and their associated currents are sensitive to sea-level rise), and, due to wave-tide interaction processes, oceanographic conditions at tidal energy sites may change. Dynamically coupled wave-tide ocean-scale models will be developed to inform the developing industry (e.g. optimal and resilient design), with new techniques that can simulate the interaction between the resource and devices. CHALLENGE 3: Are current methods of suitable as the industry develops? OBJECTIVE 3: Improved methods of device behaviour in resource and environmental assessment models The industry is evolving beyond fast, shallow, well-mixed and wave sheltered sites, to areas of the world with complex oceanographic conditions (e.g. ocean currents and swell wave dominated climates). New approaches are needed to understand the interactions between devices, resource and environment. Device-scale interaction studies assume well-mixed (i.e. homogenous) channelized flows, with tidal turbine loading from waves assessed assuming waves travel in-line with tidal currents (waves following or opposing current), which is not the case beyond an extremely limited number of tidal straits (e.g. Pentland Firth). Furthermore, device interaction with the flow must also be resolved within resource assessment, beyond simplified momentum sink terms. Device behaviour and interactions will improved at both ocean and device scales.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,EP/R034664/1,,,,,,,,Bangor University,,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:15324891,,

This paper investigates the rationality of the tower-top acceleration limit by evaluating the correlation between acceleration and drivetrain responses. A 5 MW reference drivetrain is selected and modelled on a spar-type floating wind turbine in 320 m water depth. A range of environmental conditions are selected based on the long-term distribution of wind speed, significant wave height, and peak period from hindcast data for the Northern North Sea. For each condition, global analysis using an aero-hydro-servo-elastic tool is carried out for six one-hour realizations. The global analysis results provide useful information on their own - regarding the correlation between environmental condition and tower top acceleration, and correlation between tower top acceleration and other responses of interest - which are used as input in a decoupled analysis approach. The load effects and motions from the global analysis are applied on a detailed drivetrain model in a multi-body system (MBS) analysis tool. The local responses on bearings are then obtained from MBS analysis and post-processed for the correlation study. Although the maximum acceleration provides a good indication of the wave-induced loads, it is not seen to be a good predictor for significant fatigue damage on the main bearings in this case.",,,,,"36th ASME International Conference on Ocean, Offshore and Arctic Engineering36th ASME International Conference on Ocean, Offshore and Arctic Engineering","JUN 25-30, 2017JUN 25-30, 2017","ASME, Ocean Offshore & Arctic Engn DivASME, Ocean Offshore & Arctic Engn Div","Trondheim, NORWAYTrondheim, NORWAY",6,0,0,0,0,0,6,,,,,978-0-7918-5777-9,,,,,,,,,"Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol NTNU, Dept Marine Technol, Ctr Ships & Ocean Struct CeSOS, NO-7491 Trondheim, NorwayNorwegian Univ Sci & Technol NTNU, Ctr Autonomous Marine Operat & Syst AMOS, Trondheim, Norway",,,,2018-01-03,WOS:000417227700031,,

Floating offshore wind turbine (FOWT) concepts involve new engineering and scientific challenges. A combination of waves, current, and wind loads impact the structures. Often under extreme cases, and sometimes in operational conditions, magnitudes of these loads are comparable with each other. The loads and responses may be large, and simultaneous consideration of the combined environmental loads on the response of the structure is essential. Moreover, FOWTs are often large structures and the load frequencies are comparable to the structural frequencies. This requires a fluid-structure-fluid elastic analysis which adds to the complexity of the problem. Here, we present a critical review of the existing approaches that are used to (i) estimate the hydrodynamic and aerodynamic loads on FOWTs, and (ii) to determine the structures' motion and elastic responses due to the combined loads.

Moreover, the rubber layer installed between the wall of CHFRF and the surrounding ground increases foundation flexibility and releases the larger overturning moment induced by wind. The rubber layer is made of alternately laminated rubber and steel. The objectives of this research are to study the lateral bearing behaviors of the CHFRF under monotonic and cyclic lateral loading in sand by model tests and FEM simulations. The results reveal that the CHFRF rotates during loading; and, in the ultimate state, the rotation center is located at a depth of approximately 0.6-0.65 times the foundation height and is 0.15-0.18 times the diameter of the foundation away from its centerline as well. The lateral bearing capacity of the CHFRF improves with the increase of embedded depth and vertical load applied to the foundation. Moreover, compared to the CHFRF without the rubber layer, the rubber layer can reduce the earth pressure along the wall of CHFRF by 22% and decrease the deformed range of the soil surrounding the foundation, revealing that it can reduce the loads transferred to the surrounding soil for extending the service life of the foundation. However, the thickness and stiffness of the rubber layer are important factors influencing the lateral bearing capacity and the energy dissipation of the foundation.

It includes numerical modelling and analysis for global dynamic responses of the installation system (installation vessels plus wind turbines) and for local structural responses of the blades in case of contact/impact. In particular, the stochastic nature of the environmental conditions (mainly wind and waves) and their influence on the global dynamic responses of the installation system will be assessed based on time-domain simulations. In addition, tugger line tension control is introduced for the final connection to the hub in order to reduce the motions of the blade and therefore the potential damages to the blades. It is then followed by a discussion about nonlinear structural analysis of the blade in contact with tower or surrounding structures using ABAQUS. Damages in the composite plies and sandwich core materials of the blade due to contact/impact for a given initial velocity are then estimated.

Considering the existing levels of anthropogenic pressures on coastal fish populations it is becoming increasingly important for developers and environmental regulators to gain a more comprehensive understanding of the factors influencing fish assemblages. Improving our ability to assess such fish populations in close proximity to structures will assist in increasing this knowledge. In the present study we provide the first trial use of Baited Remote Underwater Stereo-Video systems (stereo BRUVs) for the quantification of motile fauna in close proximity to offshore wind turbines. The study was conducted in the Irish Sea and finds the technique to be a viable means of assessing the motile fauna of such environments. The present study found a mixture of species including bottom dwellers, motile crustaceans and large predatory fish. The majority of taxa observed were found to be immature individuals with few adult individuals recorded. The most abundant species were the angular crab (Goneplax rhomboides) and the small-spotted catshark (Scyliorhinus canicula). Of note in this study was the generally low abundance and diversity of taxa recorded across all samples, we hypothesise that this reflects the generally poor state of the local fauna of the Irish Sea. The faunal assemblages sampled in close proximity to turbines were observed to alter with increasing distance from the structure, species more characteristic of hard bottom environments were in abundance at the turbines (e.g. Homarus gammarus, Cancer pagarus, Scyliorhinus spp.) and those further away more characteristic of soft bottoms (e.g. Norwegian Lobster). This study highlights the need for the environmental impacts of offshore renewables on motile fauna to be assessed using targeted and appropriate tools. Stereo BRUVs provide one of those tools, but like the majority of methods for sampling marine biota, they have limitations. We conclude our paper by providing a discussion of the benefits and limitations of using this BRUV technique for assessing fauna within areas close to offshore windfarms.",,,,,,,,,15,1,0,0,10,0,16,,,1932-6203,,,,,,,,,,,"Ocean Ecol Ltd, Unit 5, Severnside Pk, Epney GL2 7LN, Glos, EnglandSwansea Univ, Coll Sci, Seagrass Ecosyst Res Grp, Wallace Bldg, Swansea SA2 8PP, W Glam, WalesCMACS Ltd, 80 Eastham Village Rd, Wirral CH62 0AW, Merseyside, England",Ocean Ecol LtdCMACS Ltd,,,2016-03-31,WOS:000371724200048,26934587,

A jack up crane vessel is often employed, and individual blades with their roots equipped with mechanical joints and bolted connections are lifted to the tower-top height and mated with a pre-assembled hub. The final mating phase is challenging and faces significant risks of impact. Due to relative motions between the blade and the hub, substantial impact forces may arise and lead to severe structural damages at root connections, thereby causing delays in the installation task. The present paper considers a realistic scenario of the mating process and investigates the consequences of such impact loads. Here, a single-blade model with tugger lines and a monopile model were established using a multi-body formulation, and relative velocities under collinear wave and wind conditions were obtained. A three-dimensional finite element model was developed for the blade root with T-bolt connections, and an impact investigation was performed for the case in which a guiding connection impacts the hub. The results show severe bending and plastic deformation of the guide pin bolt together with failure of the adjoining composite laminate at the root connection. Based on the type of damage obtained for the different environmental conditions considered, this paper also discusses its consequence on the installation tasks and suggests onboard decision making in case of an impact incident.

Identifying effective conservation strategies, in order to manage or mitigate the negative impacts of human activities, requires a way to first identify and evaluate the impact of activities on ecosystem components. Multicriteria decision analysis (MCDA) techniques such as the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) offer a way to systematically evaluate and integrate stakeholder opinion in order to set priorities and make decisions. With a goal to synthesize current knowledge of the potential impacts of human activity on breeding and non-breeding seabirds in the western North Atlantic Ocean, we present a case study involving the use of AHP to assess sensitivity of species to such hazards as: fisheries bycatch, oiling, light pollution, vessel traffic, marine debris, and offshore wind turbines. Based on responses from ten North Atlantic seabird experts, fisheries bycatch (particularly when involving suspended gill nets) was identified as the greatest risk across a wide range of species, with an overall relative value of 0.47 +/- SE 0.026. Oiling risk was the second most highly ranked (0.26 +/- 0.026, of which 0.214 corresponded with surface oil, 0.044 with oil and gas platform interactions), and was considered to have the greatest potential impact on alcids (Common and Thick-billed Murre, Atlantic Puffin, Razorbill, Dovekie). Offshore wind turbines (0.097 +/- 0.022), marine debris (0.08 +/- 0.016), light pollution (0.058 +/- 0.0077), and traffic (0.042 +/- 0.0053) were considered to be less serious risks for seabirds than fisheries bycatch and oiling.

During the service life of an offshore wind turbine, the connection between mono pile and tower, the so-called grouted joint, is exposed to high dynamic loadings from wind and wave actions. Additionally the connection, which is filled with a high performance grout, has to withstand extreme load situations. Within the last years vertical settlements between the connected steel pipes have been detected. This non-redundant failure mode underlines the necessity for an optimization of the axial load bearing capacity. One possible solution is the application of shear keys, which are weld beads installed in circumferential direction of the connection on the surfaces of pile and sleeve. This additional mechanical interlock leads to compression struts and an increased axial strength. Unfortunately these geometric notches lead to local stress concentration and reduce the fatigue resistance of steel and grout The fatigue design for the steel members can be performed acc. to well known local approaches. For plain grouted joints usually uniaxial S-N-curves for the grout layer are considered, which is not appropriate in cases of shear keys. Taking the multiaxial stress space around the weld beads and suitable S-N-curves into account, the fatigue design of the connection can be conducted.",,,,,,,,,6,2,0,0,0,0,8,,,0038-9145,,,,,,,,,,,"Leibniz Univ Hannover, Inst Stahlbau, D-30167 Hannover, Germany",,,,2011-05-13,WOS:000290052800003,,

However, the required simulation cost increases exponentially with the number of environmental parameters, and considerable time and effort are required to characterise the statistical uncertainty of offshore wind turbine (OWT) systems. In this study, a K-type jacket substructure of an OWT was modelled numerically. Time rather than frequency-domain analyses were conducted because of the high nonlinearity of the OWT system. The Monte Carlo (MC) sampling method is well known for its theoretical convergence, which is independent of dimensionality. Conventional grid-based and MC sampling methods were applied for sampling simulation conditions from the probability distributions of four environmental variables. Approximately 10,000 simulations were conducted to compare the computational efficiencies of the two sampling methods, and the statistical uncertainty of the distribution of fatigue damage was assessed. The uncertainty due to the stochastic processes of the wave and wind loads presented considerable influence on the hot-spot stress of welded tubular joints of the jacket-type substructure. This implies that more simulations for each representative short-term environmental condition are required to derive the characteristic fatigue damage. The characteristic fatigue damage results revealed that the MC sampling method yielded the same error level for Grids 1 and 2 (2443 iterations required for both) after 1437 and 516 iterations for K- and KK-joint cases, respectively.

For that purpose, a three degrees-of-freedom substructuring model based on modal parameters is proposed. The whole superstructure is reduced to a punctual mass by its fundamental modal mass and height, while the pile-soil stiffness is represented by the corresponding impedance functions. The proposed model, together with characteristic relations between the fixed-base fundamental frequency and the modal parameters obtained from data of existent OWTs found in the literature, is used to analyse the influence of the superstructure and foundation dimensions and soil profile on the magnitude of the SSI phenomena. The obtained results confirm the relevance of including the foundation stiffness in the design stage of OWT systems, as variations in the fundamental frequency close to 15% can be produced. The homogeneous assumption, even if c(s,30) mean values are assumed, yields to misleading results if the actual soil profile presents properties that vary with depth.

Existing engineering models can only simulate single wakes, which are superimposed if they are interacting in a wind farm. This method is a practical solution, but it is not fully supported by a physical background. The limitation to single wakes is given by the assumption that the wake is axisymmetric. As alternative, we propose a new shear model which is based on the existing engineering wake models, but is extended to simulate also non-axisymmetric wakes. In this paper, we present the theoretical background of the model and two application cases. First, we proved that for axisymmetric wakes the new model is equivalent to a commonly used engineering model. Then, we evaluated the improvements of the new model for the simulation of a non-axisymmetric wake using a large eddy simulation as reference.

In addition, the energy performance, expressed by the energy indicators Energy Payback Ratio (EPR) Energy Payback Time (EPT), is calculated for each of the concepts.There are currently few LCA studies in existence which analyse offshore wind turbines with rated power as great as 5 MW. The results, therefore, give valuable additional environmental information concerning large offshore wind power. The resulting GHG emissions vary between 18 and 31.4 g CO2-equivalents per kWh while the energy performance, assessed as EPR and EPT, varies between 7.5 and 12.9, and 1.6 and 2.7 years, respectively. The relatively large ranges in GHG emissions and energy performance are chiefly the result of the differing steel masses required for the analysed platforms. One major conclusion from this study is that specific platform/foundation steel masses are important for the overall GHG emissions relating to offshore wind power. Other parameters of importance when comparing the environmental performance of offshore wind concepts are the lifetime of the turbines, wind conditions, distance to shore, and installation and decommissioning activities.Even though the GHG emissions from wind power vary to a relatively large degree, wind power can fully compete with other low GHG emission electricity technologies, such as nuclear, photovoltaic and hydro power.

Approximately one million vultures and raptors traverse the area during the autumn migration season, and more than 60 species of nocturnally migrating birds have been recorded there. Furthermore, more than 60 bat species inhabit this region, which also harbors the most important wind resource area of the country. There, the number of wind turbines increased from 98 to >1500 between 2006 and 2015. We estimated bird and bat mortality at three wind farms in the Isthmus, correcting for different sources of bias. Between June and November 2015, we found 75 bird and 72 bat carcasses, belonging to 30 and 20 species respectively. Although we found more bird than bat carcasses, our corrected estimates are higher for bats than for birds. Corrected mortality ranges between 4.0 - 5.6 birds/MW and 9.08 - 21.23 bats/MW during the months of the study, or between 9.06 - 12.85 birds/MW/year and 20.47 - 43.79 bats/MW/year. Contrary to patterns of aerial vertebrate mortality at wind farms in temperate latitudes, all bat and most bird fatalities were from resident species, even when considering bird migration months only. Corrected bird mortality was highest at the wind farm with the tallest wind turbines. Our estimated fatalities/MW/year are higher than rates of bat and bird mortality recorded at numerous wind farms in the United States, and our estimates may still be biased low. Thus, our results offer a first glimpse to the magnitude of bird and bat mortality at this tropical hotspot for aerial vertebrates.

Coastal populations stand to benefit greatly from reduced costs of offshore wind farms, which are one of the fastest growing and most economical sources of marine renewable energy. A considerable drawback of offshore wind power is the high cost of operations and maintenance (O&M), which can account for 25-50% of total energy production costs. Present-day maintenance procedures, using crew transfer vessels, rely on the significant wave height (H-s) as the limiting factor by which to decide whether or not it is safe to access the offshore turbines. In practice, Hs has to be applied conservatively, thus raising the costs through increased downtime. A method is proposed here with the objective of reducing overall costs through improved analysis of the motion of the crew transfer vessels (CTVs) used to transport repair technicians onto offshore wind turbine structures. CTV motion depends on the hydrodynamic forces incident on the vessel under operating conditions and the effect that the presence of the turbine has on the flow field. A change in the hydrodynamic field caused by the turbine monopile can cause a vessel abutted against the turbine support column to lose frictional contact and slip. Using the open-source computational fluid dynamics software, OpenFOAM, and in situ experimental results, the diffracted surface elevation and a wave kinematics model for the near-wake of a turbine monopile are presented. More accurate estimates of significant wave height and wave kinematics incident on a vessel close to a turbine monopile will facilitate much improved analysis of vessel motions under operational conditions.

The topology optimization method is applicable at an early design stage, which can determine the initial structure and force transmission path. The whole design space is chosen as design variables, and the goal is to maximize the structural stiffness. A set of constraints based on multi-criteria design assessment is applied according to standard requirements, which includes stress, deformation, vibration and design variable constraints.

In this paper we design and simulate communication network with reconfiguration for southwest offshore wind farm (WF) in South Korea. To do so, first we considered the physical layout of the southwest WF and design a robust communication network topology with minimum number of redundant network resources. The effectiveness of the communication network is evaluated through different network failure scenarios between WF and control center in OPNET.

These LNs are mapped into critical and noncritical LNs classes according to the required quality of service (QoS). The amount of data traffic is then defined for each class type.

Nevertheless, extracting ecologically relevant information from a large amount of raw images remains a time-consuming and somewhat laborious challenge. Thus, underwater imagery processing needs to strike a compromise between time-efficient image annotation and accuracy in quantifying benthic community composition. Designing and implementing robust image sampling and image annotation protocols are therefore critical to rationally address these trade-offs between ecological accuracy and processing time. The aim of this study was to develop and to optimize a reliable image scoring strategy based on the point count method using imagery data acquired on tide-swept macroepibenthic communities. Using a stepwise approach, we define an underwater imagery processing protocol that is effective in terms of (i) time allocated to overall image, (ii) reaching a satisfactory accuracy to estimate the occurrence of dominant benthic taxa, and (iii) adopting a sufficient taxonomic resolution to describe changes in community composition. We believe that our method is well adapted to investigate the composition of epibenthic communities on artificial reefs and can be useful in surveying colonization of other human structures (wind turbine foundations, pipelines, etc.) in coastal areas.

Calls to relax complete removal requirements in some circumstances and allow part of an O&G installation to be left in the marine environment are increasing. Yet knowledge regarding the biological communities that develop on these structures and their ecological role in the North Sea is currently insufficient to inform such decommissioning decisions. To focus debate regarding decommissioning policy and guide ecological research, we review environmental policy objectives in the region, summarize existing knowledge regarding ecological aspects of decommissioning for both O&G and OWF installations, and identify approaches to address knowledge gaps through science-industry collaboration. We find that in some cases complete removal will conflict with other policies regarding protection and restoration of reefs, as well as the conservation of species within the region. Key ecological considerations that are rarely considered during decommissioning decisions are: (i) provision of reef habitat, (ii) productivity of offshore ecosystems, (iii) enhancement of biodiversity, (iv) protection of the seabed from trawling, and (v) enhancement of connectivity.

Accelerating the development of new energy, increasing the proportion of clean energy, and developing high-voltage transmission and smart grids is the strategic choice for China's energy security and energy restructuring as well as for atmospheric environment improvement and reduction in carbon dioxide emissions. As a strategically emerging industry, the wind power industry in China, particularly its spatial patterns and influencing factors, should be provided close attention. This paper presents a large amount of data on Chinese wind power equipment manufacturing companies from statistics on China's installed wind power capacity (CWEA) from 2000 to 2014. The spatial patterns and influencing factors in China's wind turbine manufacturing industry are analyzed, and its features and factors are discussed to provide a scientific reference in an ordered pattern. Results on spatial patterns are discussed according to the following two distinct points. First, China's wind turbine manufacturing has formed a relatively complete production, marketing, transportation, installation, operation and management, maintenance and overhaul industrial chain, and enterprises own many bases but display a multi-point scattered spatial distribution. However, different parts of manufacturing enterprises adopt different exhaustive strategies as shown in this research. Overall, national and regional manufacturing centers are being formed. Second, China's domestic wind power equipment manufacturing enterprises are mainly established through relevant equipment manufacturing business investment and are located in the same city as their investment companies; meanwhile, foreign enterprises are generally located in cities with a solid foundation equipment manufacturing industrial base. The subsidiary firms of wind turbine manufacturing enterprises are located in Northwest, North, and Northeast China, whereas wind farms are generally located in eastern coastal areas with abundant wind resources. Furthermore, the influencing factors in China's wind turbine manufacturing industry are analyzed as a composite issue from several aspects of wind resource endowment, industrial base, policy support, and economic and technical support. (1) The industrial base primarily affects the choice of location of the wind power equipment business parent company. (2) Wind resource endowments mainly affect the location selection of subsidiary companies; cities with many wind resource areas contain a large number of wind power equipment company subsidiaries. (3) Local government support considerably affects choice of location of wind power equipment company subsidiaries. (4) Among wind resource endowment, industrial base, and local government support, the industrial base plays the most important role. Overall, the strong support provided by government policy is the foundation, and improving the technical level is a necessary condition. The industrial base often plays a decisive role. Regional economic openness has a significant impact on the spatial patterns of foreign wind power manufacturers in the early development of the wind power industry. Market and labor capabilities are also vital factors that affect the spatial patterns of China's wind turbine manufacturing industry.The results of this study provide important information for wind equipment manufacturing companies to select new locations and for local governments to develop strategic industrial development policies. The results also provide a useful reference for foreign firms that intend to explore the Chinese wind power market. (c) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Each of these load cases depends on combinations of at least three jointly distributed metocean parameters, the mean wind speed, the significant wave height, and the peak spectral period. In practice, these variables are commonly estimated for the 50-year extreme storm using a simple but coarse method, wherein 50-year values of wind speed and wave height are calculated independently and combined with a range of peak spectral period conditioned on the 50-year wave height. The IEC Standard does not provide detailed guidance on how to calculate the appropriate range of peak spectral period. Given the varying correlation of these parameters from site-to-site, this approach is clearly an approximation which is assumed to overestimate structural loads since wind and wave are combined without regard to their correlation. In this paper, we introduce an alternative multivariate method for assessing extreme storm conditions. The method is based on the Nataf model and the Inverse First Order Reliability Method (IFORM) and uses measurements or hindcasts of wind speed, wave height and peak spectral period to estimate an environmental surface which defines combinations of these parameters with a particular recurrence period. The method is illustrated using three sites along the U.S. Atlantic coast near Maine, Delaware and Georgia. Mudline moments are calculated using this new multivariate method for a hypothetical 5 MW OWT supported by a monopile and compared with mudline moments calculated using simpler univariate approaches. The results of the comparison highlight the importance of selecting an appropriate range of the peak spectral period when using the simpler univariate approaches. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

The aim is to establish a model, workable in the frequency and time domain, that can be applied in aeroelastic codes for fast and reliable evaluation of the dynamic structural response of wind turbines, in which the geometrical dissipation related to wave propagation into the subsoil is included. Based on the optimal order of a consistent lumped-parameter model obtained by the domain-transformation method and a weighted least-squares technique, the dynamic vibration response of a 5.0 MW offshore wind turbine is evaluated for different stratifications, environmental conditions and foundation geometries by the aeroelastic nonlinear multi-body code HAWC2. Analyses show that a consistent lumped-parameter model with three to five internal degrees of freedom per displacement or rotation of the foundation is necessary in order to obtain an accurate prediction of the foundation response in the frequency and time domain. In addition, the required static bearing capacity of surface foundations leads to fore-aft vibrations during normal operation of a wind turbine that are insensitive to wave propagating in the subsoil-even for soil stratifications with low cut-in frequencies. In this regard, utilising discrete second-order models for the physical interpretation of a rational filter puts special demands on the Newmark beta-scheme, where the time integration in most cases only provides a causal response for constant acceleration within each time step.

Then, for each active fish, a level of swimming activity was determined and both migration behavior and level of swimming activity were correlated to the individual wet weight (used as a proxy of energy stores), standard metabolic rate (relative SMR) and transcriptomic profile of metabolismrelated genes. Results showed that spring glass eels presented a lower probability to migrate, a lower wet weight and a higher expression of genes involved in energy stress resistance than autumn ones, supporting a conditional strategy based on individual's energy status. However, within each season, no wet weight differencewas observed between active and non-active fish. In autumn glass eels, migration behavior was weakly related to relative SMR while in spring, none of the parameters analyzed allows discriminating active and non-active glass eels. The level of swimming activity in active fishwas related to their relative SMR in autumn and to their wet weight in spring. Altogether, our results could not validate a conditional strategy but spring glass eels displayed some signs of energy distress and a lower level of swimming activity than autumn ones.

In recent years, the wind industry has become more open to adopting PHM solutions, especially those focusing on diagnostics. However, prognostics activities are, in general, still at the research and development stage. On the other hand, the industry has a request to estimate a component's remaining useful life (RUL) when it has faulted, and this is a key output of prognostics. Systematically presenting PHM technologies to the wind industry by highlighting the RUL prediction need potentially helps speed up its acceptance and provides more benefits from PHM to the industry. In this paper, we introduce a PHM for wind framework. It highlights specifics unique to wind turbines and features integration of data and physics domain information and models. The output of the framework focuses on RUL prediction. To demonstrate its application, a data domain method for wind turbine gearbox fault diagnostics is presented. It uses supervisory control and data acquisition system time series data, normalizes gearbox temperature measurements with reference to environmental temperature and turbine power, and leverages big data analytics and machine-learning techniques to make the model scalable and the diagnostics process automatic. Another physics-domain modeling method for RUL prediction of wind turbine gearbox high-speed-stage bearings failed by axial cracks is also discussed. Bearing axial cracking has been shown to be the prevalent wind turbine gearbox failure mode experienced in the field and is different from rolling contact fatigue, which is targeted during the bearing design stage. The method uses probability of failure as a component reliability assessment and RUL prediction metric, which can be expanded to other drivetrain components or failure modes. The presented PHM for wind framework is generic and applicable to both land based and offshore wind turbines.",,,,,ASME Turbo Expo: Turbomachinery Technical Conference and ExpositionASME Turbo Expo: Turbomachinery Technical Conference and Exposition,"JUN 17-21, 2019JUN 17-21, 2019","ASME, Int Gas Turbine InstASME, Int Gas Turbine Inst","Phoenix, AZPhoenix, AZ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,978-0-7918-5872-1,,,,,,,,,"Natl Renewable Energy Lab, Golden, CO 80401 USA",,,,2019-12-30,WOS:000502169000071,,

Waves when traveling on current are affected by the current, leading to frequency shift and shape modification. To include such interactions in FOWT analysis, which has not been considered by the researchers till date, a nonlinear hydrodynamic model for multicable mooring systems is presented that is able to consider the cable geometric nonlinearity, seabed contact, and the current effect. The mooring model is then coupled with a spar-type FOWT model that handles the structural dynamics of turbine blades and tower, aerodynamics of the wind-blade interaction, and wave-current effects on the spar. The analytical wave-current interaction model based on Airy theory considering the current effect is used in the computation of flow velocity and acceleration. Numerical studies are then carried out based on the NREL offshore 5-MW baseline wind turbine supported on top of the OC3-Hywind spar buoy. Two cases, (1) when the currents are favorable and (2) when the currents are adverse, are examined. Differences of up to 15% have been observed by comparing the cable fairlead tension obtained excluding and including the wave-current interactions. In particular, when irregular waves interact with adverse current, a simple superposition treatment of the wave and the current effects seems to underestimate the spar motion and the cable fairlead tension. This indicates that the wave-current interaction is an important aspect and is needed to be considered in FOWT analysis.",,,,,,,,,25,0,0,0,0,0,25,,,1095-4244,1099-1824,,,,,,,,,,"Trinity Coll Dublin, Sch Engn, Dublin, Ireland",,,,2019-01-30,WOS:000455955800012,,

Since reliable maps of the underwater nature are scarce, planners often have to work with inconsistent data. We compare the outcomes of three hypothetical planning schemes with dissimilar input benthic ecology datasets in order to define suitable sites for shallow water wind turbine placement. The study is conducted in the northern Baltic Sea where the brown algae bladderwrack (Fucus spp.) forms important submerged habitats that can be disturbed by wind turbine construction. We evaluated the effects of the input data using two different approaches. In the first, we placed a maximum number of wind turbines at four different depth classes. After choosing the locations, we examined the potential area of affected Fucus habitats. In the second approach, we tested the accumulation of damage to Fucus habitats when adding new turbines to the research area by starting from the furthest available location of known important Fucus sites. Both approaches indicated that using data from airborne LIDAR helps coastal planners avoid the risk of unnecessary destruction of benthic key habitats. LIDAR surveys can help to optimize the locations for the detailed planning of vast areas in a way that point-based inventories or statistical predictive modeling cannot achieve.

In the framework of finite element analysis, a fully coupled two-phase model and a hypoplastic constitutive model are used to describe the saturated sandy soil behaviour under repetitive loading.

Special attention is dedicated to load carrying behaviour of bucket top plate, inner and outer skirt as well as base and their changes resulting from a loosening of soil inside the bucket with variable aspect ratio.

This paper aims to evaluate and optimize the performance of an Overtopping Wave Energy Converter (OWEC) as part of a hybrid generation system integrated into an offshore wind turbine. For that purpose, two configurations have been investigated. A 100kW OWEC was combined with a micro-gas turbine of 80kW at the first configuration and the same OWEC with a wind turbine (WT) of 200kW at the second. The preliminary design of an integrated offshore OWEC/WT is presented.The findings of the present investigation have been applied to a specific test case of a small, off grid island, in the Aegean archipelago. Regarding its power requirement, Donoussa island currently relies exclusively on fossil fuel. At the same time, a high wave and wind power potential is available. A representative set of wind data have been obtained and numerically analyzed. A wave simulation, overtopping prediction and power output has been carried out. Moreover, a techno-economic and environmental assessment of the proposed offshore integrated design is presented. The stand alone coastal OWEC, and a single offshore wind turbine have been evaluated versus the proposed offshore hybrid power generation scheme.The OWEC is expected to generate 320MWh per year, thus covering half of the island's estimated power demand. Using both wave and wind power generation, energy autonomy of the island could be achieved. In order to cover the requirements of extreme cases, a micro gas-turbine power generation unit has been considered, in parallel to the existing fossil fuel power generation unit. From the techno-economic assessment point of view, the coastal OWEC construction has a shorter return on investment time of 11 years as compared to 13 years of the proposed integrated design but lower profitable investment. Besides providing sufficient electrical power for the island, the additional environmental benefit of the proposed system is that it can be used to counter coastal erosion.The integrated offshore OWEC/WT design could potentially double the power output of each and every offshore wind turbine installation. This result could therefore be interpreted either as halving of the required number of offshore wind turbines erections or as doubling of the power output of an offshore wind park.",,,,,ASME Turbo Expo: Turbine Technical Conference and ExpositionASME Turbo Expo: Turbine Technical Conference and Exposition,"JUN 16-20, 2014JUN 16-20, 2014",Int Gas Turbine InstInt Gas Turbine Inst,"Dusseldorf, GERMANYDusseldorf, GERMANY",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,978-0-7918-4566-0,,,,,,,,,"Aristotle Univ Thessaloniki, Sch Engn, GR-54124 Thessaloniki, Greece",,,,2015-10-22,WOS:000362058200073,,

J,,,,,,,,,Gordon Hastie,,Development of a standardised marine mammal monitoring system for the tidal energy industry,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Awarded Grant,Jan 01 2018,2018,"Many countries have set ambitious renewable energy targets with offshore sources anticipated to form an important part of this; for example, it is estimated that one fifth of the electrical supply in the UK could come from marine (wave and tidal stream) resources. However, the environmental impacts of tidal turbines on marine wildlife (particularly seals, whales, and dolphins) is largely unknown. One major concern is the potential for marine mammals to collide with the rotating turbine blades causing injury or death. It is critical to learn whether this concern is valid by collecting data on the underwater movements of marine mammals around operating tidal turbines. Collecting these data is extremely challenging and available methods for measuring movements of marine mammals underwater and interactions with tidal turbines are limited. However, a small number of cutting-edge technologies have the ability to detect and track marine mammals underwater; these are underwater video, and active- and passive-acoustic tracking. This project will design and build a standardised marine mammal detection and tracking system based on the integration of this suite of technologies for the tidal energy industry. The system will be designed to be standardised in terms of the data collected but will be flexible to ensure it can be integrated into a range of different tidal turbine designs and can be deployed in a variety of different tidal environments. Effectively, the system will be designed to be 'plug and play' so that it can be integrated easily with future tidal turbines, and can be deployed and retrieved with minimal impact to turbine operation. Further, to ensure that the data collected by the system is standardised and therefore comparable between future monitoring studies, a series of open source and freely available data archiving and analysis tools for the datasets will be provided. Overall, this project aims to deliver a unique monitoring tool that will provide the Tidal Energy Industry with a data collection system that may be required as part of their consent monitoring conditions, and will provide regulatory authorities with the evidence base upon which to make informed decisions about marine mammal collision risk during the consenting process for tidal energy developments.keywords: tidal stream energy, tidal turbines, marine mammals, collision risk, impact assessments, sonar, video, hydrophones, seals, dolphins, porpoises, behaviour, underwater trackingstakeholders: Regulators, Tidal Developers, Statutory Advisors, Scottish Government, Scottish Natural Heritage, Natural Resources Wales, Atlantis Resources Ltd",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,NE/R014639/1,,,,,,,,University of St Andrews,,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:15383145,,

The statistical evaluation revealed that the stability state in the atmospheric boundary does not seem to depend on simple properties like the Reynolds number, wind speed, wind direction, or turbulence level. Therefore, we used higher statistical properties (described by so-called shape factors) to relate them to the stability state. Data was classified to be either within an unstable, neutral, or stable stratification. We found that, in case of stable stratification, the shape factor was mostly close to zero, indicating that a thermally stable environment produces closer-to Gaussian distributions.

This study presents a series of free-fall penetration tests with model anchors in different weights to assess the anchor behavior during the free-fall penetration performance in one-layer soil with a constant shear strength profile. Anchor velocities and embedment depths were measured by a magnetometer. An energy-based model and a force-based model were calibrated against the test results of model anchors with different weights. Based on the calibrated force-based model, a series of design charts were developed to estimate the embedment depth of anchors in different sizes and with different impact velocities in various marine clays.

This study is limited to the Michigan state boundary for the OWF sites and viewshed impacts. Investment cost depends on the depth and distance to shore of the farm. View damage cost depends on household density and consumer willingness to pay to avoid the visual disamenity of wind turbines. Both these costs are dependent on the geographic location and are summed to create an aggregate cost. Using ArcGIS, the OWF siting locations were mapped, with spatial analysis revealing the northern region of the lake at the minimum aggregate cost. The view damage cost contributes at most 68%, but on average 7%, to the aggregate cost. The aggregate levelized cost of energy (LCOE) ranges from 183 to 368 $/MWh (average of 256 $/MWh).

The maritime climate, the composition of the coast, lay-out distribution and characteristics of the facility's components need to be known, particularly foundations as they are the main obstacles waves and currents meet.

The use of a coupled model allows for capturing the full dynamic interaction between all the elements. The structural analysis is carried out in the time-domain. A non-linear integration scheme is necessarily applied due to the effects of the rotation of the blades. Environmental actions, such as wind and waves, are considered as loading conditions. Fatigue damage at the welds of the joints is taken into account. The objective function to be minimized is the weight of the structure. The shape and sizing optimization model is stated in terms of two variables that define the overall shape of the jacket, along with the dimensions of the cross-sections of the structural members. The model is subjected to Ultimate Limit Stress (ULS), Fatigue Limit State and natural frequency constraints. The time-dependent ULS constraints are efficiently treated by means of a new formulation that is based on constraint aggregation. Fatigue accumulation during the whole design life of the structure is accurately assessed, without the need for excessively costly numerical simulations. The optimization problem is solved by means of Sequential Linear Programming, what requires a full first order sensitivity analysis to be performed.

This would imply design for survival in extreme conditions. The failure of a system can occur when the ultimate strength is exceeded (ultimate limit state (ULS)) or fatigue limit (fatigue limit state) is exhausted. The focus in this paper is on the determination of extreme responses for ULS design checks, considering coupled wave and wind induced motion and structural response in harsh condition up to 14.4 m significant wave height and 49 m/s 10 min average wind speed (at the top of the tower, 90 m) for a parked floating wind turbine of a spar type concept. In the survival condition, the wind induced resonant responses (mainly platform pitch resonance) are dominant. Due to the platform resonant motion responses, the structural responses are close to Gaussian, but wide banded. The critical structural responses are determined by coupled aerohydroelastic time domain simulation. Based on different simulations (20 1 h, 20 2 h, 20 3 h, and 20 5 h), the mean up-crossing rate has been found in order to predict the extreme structural responses. The most probable maximum of the bending moment and the bending moment having an up-crossing rate of 10(-4) are found to be close in the present research. The minimum total simulation time in order to get accurate results is highly correlated with the needed up-crossing rate. The 1 h and 2 h raw data cannot provide any information for 10(-4) up-crossing rate. Comparison of different simulation periods shows that the 20 1 h simulations can be used in order to investigate the 3 h extreme bending moment if the proper extrapolation of up-crossing rate is used.

The offshore wind industry is gearing up to this challenge with an increase in the rate at which high generating capacity offshore wind farms (OWFs) are deployed. Innovative repowering integrates early decommissioning and repowering of OWFs by using future large wind turbines (WTs, e.g. 20 MW WT). First-of-its-kind case studies have been presented to quantify the increased power generation capacity and the levelized cost of energy (LCOE) of repowering two OWFs with fixed and floating foundations. The repowering alternatives have been compared with the base case scenario (which involves decommissioning after the design life of 20 years) and the lifetime extension scenario (decommissioning in 25th year). The case studies show that a significant increase in energy output could be coupled with a reduction in the LCOE using the same OWF sites. The capacities of the OWF with fixed and floating foundations have been increased by 2.5 times (317 MW to 800 MW) and 2 times (400 MW to 800 MW) by repowering, respectively. Compared with developing an OWF on a new site, repowering has the potential to significantly accelerate the current installation capacity. Repowering has the potential to provide a competitive alternative to the lifetime extension of OWFs. Furthermore, the OWF with floating foundations has greater LCOE reductions compared with the OWFs with fixed foundations. This study has also provided evidence that enabling technologies and collaboration with other sectors would reduce the environmental impacts and costs of decommissioning of OWFs. This paper has suggested a way forward for research and development to overcome both technological and non-technological barriers to unlock the potential benefits of innovative alternatives of repowering OWFs.",,,,,Conference on Science of Making Torque from Wind (TORQUE)Conference on Science of Making Torque from Wind (TORQUE),"SEP 28-OCT 02, 2020SEP 28-OCT 02, 2020",,"Delft Univ Technol, Wind Energy Inst, ELECTR NETWORKDelft Univ Technol, Wind Energy Inst, ELECTR NETWORK",4,0,0,0,0,0,4,,,1742-6588,1742-6596,*****************,,,,,,,,,"Equinor ASA, Energy Storage & Emerging Technol, Stavanger, NorwayWestern Norway Univ Appl Sci, Dept Mech & Marine Engn, Bergen, Norway",,,,2021-09-23,WOS:000686550401078,,

An accurate assessment of the bearing capacity of these foundations is of great importance in the design. This paper presents a study into the monotonic lateral loading behavior of tetrapod piled jacket foundations in undrained clay, with the complex lateral loads being simplified to an equivalent lateral load acting at a certain height of the jacket. A centrifuge testing programme was undertaken to provide high-quality validation data for the development of a three-dimensional finite element model established using ABAQUS. The key parameters investigated are the spacing and embedment of the piles, the height to which the equivalent lateral load acts and the angle between the direction of this load and the orthogonal line of the jacket in the horizontal plane. The parametric study aims to provide guidance to the optimal design of jacket piled foundations: for instance, to examine the critical pile embedment beyond which limited improvement of the bearing capacity of the foundation can be achieved and to define the most unfavorable lateral loading direction. In addition, the limitations of the commonly assumed constant p-multiplier, regardless of the lateral deflection of the pile and the depth along it, are critically discussed. Then an improved analytical model is proposed, based on the existing model used in design and the parametric study results, to quantify the variation of p-multiplier with depth and with pile deflection.",,,,,,,,,30,1,0,0,0,0,32,,,0141-1187,1879-1549,,,,,,,,,,"Zhejiang Univ, MOE Key Lab Soft Soils & Geoenvironm Engn, Hangzhou 310058, Zhejiang, Peoples R China",,,,2018-06-05,WOS:000432503600012,,

A model of one of the platform columns has been built. This allows for the fitting of either a plain solid plate or the real heave plate prototype design. The latter is equipped with a vertical flap at its edge. The influence of the flap on the hydrodynamic coefficients is investigated through a results comparison with the plain solid one. The model plate diameter is 1 m, thus becoming, to the authors' knowledge, the largest for which results have been published. Results from experiments, in which added mass and damping coefficients have been measured, are presented. This experimental campaign also comprised the direct measurement of dynamic pressures on both heave plates, a fundamental magnitude for the structural design, which, until now, had not been experimentally explored for this type of system. For comparative reasons, numerical simulations were also conducted following common industry standards, both with a wide-spread frequency domain panel method (WADAM) and a RANS CFD commercial code (ANSYS CFX). Finally, results are compared with literature and consistent non-dimensionalizations are sought, with the aim of making these results useful for preliminary design purposes. The authors believe this research could benefit the offshore wind industry by improving the hydrodynamic design of the concept. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

The spatial pattern of settlement of megalopae of the shore crab Carcinus maenas along a longitudinal estuarine gradient (Mira River Estuary, Portugal) was examined, as well as its effects on the juvenile population. To measure megalopal settlement, four replicate collectors were deployed in six equally spaced stations along the estuarine axis. Juveniles were collected on the same locations with a quadrat randomly deployed on the substrate. To assess fine-scale megalopal settlement within a curved region of the estuary, replicate collectors were deployed on both margins along Moinho da Asneira curve. Megalopae settled differently along the six longitudinal points, with a tendency to attenuate their settlement upstream. Within the curved region, megalopae preferentially settled on the left margin collectors, probably due to the weaker velocity speeds felt on this margin. Concerning the overall juvenile density, there were significant differences among the stations distributed along the estuary, but they did no reflect a longitudinal dispersion attenuation pattern. Size-frequency distribution of the juvenile population showed that the average size is higher on the left margin. Recruits (carapace length between 1.0 mm and 3.4 mm) were more abundant on the upstream stations. Density of early juveniles (3.4 mm-6.5 mm) and juveniles (6.5 mm-10 mm) was more stable throughout the estuary axis than that of recruits. This distribution pattern may result from tidal excursion processes or mechanisms to avoid biotic interactions, such as predation and competition. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

Several groups of variables have been considered for determining these alternatives: wind turbines, floating platforms, mooring system, anchoring process, kind of seabed, electric system, installation, shipyard and maintenance. The method proposed has been applied to the case of the North-West coast of Spain (Galicia region). For this case test three different platforms have been analyzed: Tensioned Leg, Spar and Semisubmersible platforms. Results, which are presented by using maps of the area, conclude that offshore substation, string electric configuration and tree fall decommissioning method are the best options for minimizing the costs. In addition, the installation method will be conditioned by the type of floating platform and mooring material, whereas the disposition and anchor decisions are dependent on the geographic location.

For each site, the cost of energy and the profitability of the investment are calculated. Moreover, in the most promising site, different wind turbine generators (WTGs) models are compared in order to evaluate the best performances. In the best site, which presents an average wind speed at 35 m height of 7.66 m/s, the cost of energy ranges between 5.2 and 6.0 cEuro/ kWh.

Insights obtained from particle image velocimetry analyses, performed on images of a half-bucket installing against a Perspex window taken in a geotechnical centrifuge are discussed. Compared with the initial self-weight penetration, the deformation mechanism governing the suction-assisted phase shows a preference for the soil below the skirt tips to move inwards and upwards inside the bucket. The installation process is responsible for changes in relative density and permeability within the bucket. In these experiments, the majority of the soil plug heave can be attributed to the soil displaced inwards by the advancing skirts, with a minor contribution caused by dilation.

This structure is excited by several environmental impacts like wind and wave loads or centrifugal loads from the rotor motion. In order to reach competitive costs of energy, it is crucial to minimize the lifetime capital expenses by means of robust and reliability-based design. However, a simulation-based optimization approach on the full scale model requires high numerical capacity. In this work, the problem of numerically expensive fatigue life evaluation is addressed by the utilization of a meta-model approach.

Ocean wind distribution around the globe can be obtained from satellite observations to compensate for limited in situ measurements. However, previous studies have largely ignored uncertainties in ocean wind energy resources assessment with multiple satellite data. It is against this background that the current study compares mean wind speeds (MWS) and wind power densities (WPD) retrieved from scatterometers (QuikSCAT, ASCAT) and radiometers (WindSAT) and their different combinations with National Data Buoy Center (NDBC) buoy measurements at heights of 10 m and 100 m (wind turbine hub height) above sea level.

A case study on the offshore wind farm Horns Rev I is conducted with this purpose, by quantifying wake effects using the Dynamic Wake Meandering (DWM) method, which has previously been validated based on CFD, Lidar and full scale load measurements. Fully coupled aeroelastic load simulations using turbulent wind conditions are conducted for all wind directions and mean wind speeds between cut-in and cut-out using site specific turbulence level measurements. Based on the mean wind speed and direction distribution, the representative 20-year lifetime fatigue loads are calculated. It is found that the heaviest loaded WT is not the same when looking at blade root, tower top or tower base components. The blade loads are mainly dominated by the wake situations above rated wind speed and the highest loaded blades are in the easternmost row as the dominating wind direction is from West. Regarding the tower components, the highest loaded WTs are also located towards the eastern central location. The turbines with highest power production are, not surprisingly, the ones facing a free sector towards west and south. The power production results of few turbines are compared with SCADA data. The results of this paper are expected to have significance for operation and maintenance planning, where the schedules for inspection and service activities can be adjusted to the requirements arising from the varying fatigue levels.

A computer-aided method to optimize monopiles for different fatigue lifetimes was developed. The optimization was performed with a genetic algorithm. Fatigue constraints were evaluated with aero-hydro-elastic load simulations in the time-domain. Importance sampling was applied to reduce the required number of load cases to 120 (only 7% of total amount of load cases). The optimization was tested for an 8 MW offshore wind turbine. Results prove that the developed method using importance sampling is suitable to gain fast and accurate optimization results. Only 5% more steel is needed to raise the fatigue lifetime from 25 to 35 years for a design without inspections. The increase of steel mass flattens out towards longer fatigue lifetimes since the structure becomes stiffer and less prone to wave excitation. This is valuable input to decide on the ideal service lifetime and maintenance strategies.,,,,,15th Deep Sea Offshore Wind R and D Conference (EERA DeepWind)15th Deep Sea Offshore Wind R and D Conference (EERA DeepWind),"JAN 17-18, 2018JAN 17-18, 2018",NTNU; European Energy Res Alliance; European Energy Res Alliance Joint Programme Wind Energy; Res Council NorwayNTNU; European Energy Res Alliance; European Energy Res Alliance Joint Programme Wind Energy; Res Council Norway,"SINTEF, Trondheim, NORWAYSINTEF, Trondheim, NORWAY",4,0,0,0,0,0,4,,,1742-6588,1742-6596,*****************,,,,,,,,,"Ramboll, Wind & Towers, Stadtdeich 7, D-20097 Hamburg, GermanyNorwegian Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Hogskoleringen 7a, N-7491 Trondheim, NorwayDelft Univ Technol, Fac Mech Maritime & Mat Engn, Delft, Netherlands",Ramboll,,,2018-01-01,WOS:000546234600014,,

The turbines were in deep (>40 m) water, 25 km from the Moray Firth Special Area of Conservation (SAC), potentially affecting a protected population of bottlenose dolphins. We measured pile-driving noise at distances of 0.1 (maximum broadband peak to peak sound level 205 dB re 1 mu Pa) to 80 km (no longer distinguishable above background noise). These sound levels were related to noise exposure criteria for marine mammals to assess possible effects.

To make well-founded decisions on possible lifetime extensions, damage extrapolations based on measurements are needed. However, although for all substructures, fatigue damage calculations were conducted during the design process, there is no consensus on how to extrapolate 10-minute damages to lifetime damages. Furthermore, extrapolating damages is an uncertain process and its actual reliability is unknown. Therefore, the current work uses data of off shore strain measurements to assess different approaches of extrapolating damages, and to investigate the reliability of damage extrapolations. For the present data, the most reliable lifetime estimations are possible, if the damage data is split up into wind speed bins. For each wind speed bin, the occurrence probability should be based on data rather than on design documents. Moreover, using mean damages in each bin is the best practice. Furthermore, our results suggest that strain measurements of about 9 to 10 months lead to a relatively representative and unbiased data set.

The SFC is a combined energy concept consisting of a braceless semisubmersible type floating wind turbine and three fully submerged rotating flap-type Wave Energy Converters (WECs). In order to study the survivability of the concept the focus is on extreme environmental conditions. In these conditions the SFC will not produce wind or wave power; the wind turbine is parked with the blades feathered into the wind and the WECs are released to freely rotate about their axis of rotation. Firstly the development and set-up of the physical model are presented. Static, quasi-static, decay, regular waves and irregular waves with wind loading tests are conducted on an 1:50 scale physical model. Aligned and oblique wave with wind loading conditions are considered. Measured variables that are presented include motions of the semisubmersible platform in six rigid body degrees of freedom, rotation of the flap-type WECs, tension of mooring lines, internal loads of the arms that connect the flap with the pontoon of the platform and tower base bending moment. The experimental data are compared with numerical predictions obtained by a fully coupled numerical model. The comparison is made at model scale. A good agreement between experimental data and numerical predictions is observed confirming the accuracy of the numerical models and tools that are used. The discrepancy between numerical and experimental results is smaller for regular than irregular waves. Compared to oblique conditions a better agreement between experimental and numerical results is obtained for the case of aligned wave and wind loadings. The results obtained demonstrate the good performance of the SFC concept in extreme environmental conditions. No strong nonlinear hydrodynamic phenomena are observed in the tests.

To examine the causes of this damage, specifically, delamination and cracking in the WT blades, this study first reviewed and analyzed data in related engineering documents. Similar overseas cases were also reviewed to identify the common causes of turbine blade failure incidents. The structural mechanics of WT blades were then analyzed with behavioral models to identify the mechanisms of the damage.

Caisson (skirted) foundations have also been evaluated in some projects as an economical alternative. While the main concern in design of offshore foundations has been the environmental loads, the recent growth in construction of OWTs in seismic regions with the possibility of soil liquefaction has necessitated evaluation of the impact of earthquake and liquefaction from strong shakings on these structures. Several studies have reported the consequences of soil liquefaction for buildings and onshore structures; However, the effects of liquefaction on offshore foundations have not been sufficiently studied. This paper investigates the use of advanced liquefaction modeling in assessment of the response of monopiles and caissons for offshore wind turbines. The software FLAC3D and the SANISAND constitutive model are used to conduct the nonlinear dynamic analyses for OWTs. Excess pore water pressure during earthquake shaking and earthquake-induced displacements are computed at various points in the soil medium around the considered monopile and caisson foundations. The analyses reveal that SANISAND model is capable of simulating the pore pressure generation in the free-field as observed in a recent centrifuge test. The numerical results also indicate that both monopile and caissons in liquefiable soil deposits experience considerable rotations under the combined action of wind loads and earthquake shaking when liquefaction occurs.",,,,,,,,,46,3,0,0,0,0,48,,,0267-7261,1879-341X,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Bologna UNIBO, Dept Civil Chem Environm & Mat Engn, Bologna, ItalyNorwegian Geotech Inst NGI, Oslo, NorwayNorwegian Univ Sci & Technol NTNU, Trondheim, Norway",,,,2020-09-01,WOS:000551483900032,,

The objectives of the optimization process are to minimize additional costs and losses in the generator to allow for a fair evaluation of the impact of the VAWT environment on the powertrain. A spectrum of torque control strategies was tested based on the ratio, q, of the allowed electrical torque variation to the inherent mechanical torque variation. Equations relating q to the generator losses were established. The effect of q on the energy extracted by the rotor was also investigated and incorporated into the optimization process. This work shows that a variable q strategy with respect to wind speed can improve turbine performance across the range of operational wind speeds depending on the torque loading from the rotor blades. In turn, this also allows for the torque rating of the generator to be reduced from the peak torque rating that would otherwise be expected, creating an opportunity to downscale the generator size, reducing costs. The optimization of powertrain design and operation should be carried out at as high level as is possible, ideally using the fully factored cost of energy (COE) to guard against unexpected losses because of excessive focus in one COE factor (for example reducing upfront cost but in turn reducing availability).",,,,,,,,,3,0,0,0,0,0,3,,,1095-4244,1099-1824,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Strathclyde, Wind Energy & Control Ctr, Elect & Elect Engn, Glasgow, Lanark, Scotland",,,,2019-10-04,WOS:000486267600004,,

The ocean provides a largely untapped source of renewable energy. As a result, harvesting electrical power from the wind and tides has sparked immense government and commercial interest but with relatively little detailed understanding of the potential environmental impacts. This study investigated how the sound emitted from an underwater tidal turbine and an offshore wind turbine would influence the settlement and metamorphosis of the pelagic larvae of estuarine brachyuran crabs which are ubiquitous in most coastal habitats. In a laboratory experiment the median time to metamorphosis (TTM) for the megalopae of the crabs Austrohelice crassa and Hemigrapsus crenulatus was significantly increased by at least 18 h when exposed to either tidal turbine or sea-based wind turbine sound, compared to silent control treatments. Contrastingly, when either species were subjected to natural habitat sound, observed median TTM decreased by approximately 21-31% compared to silent control treatments, 38-47% compared to tidal turbine sound treatments, and 46-60% compared to wind turbine sound treatments. A lack of difference in median TTM in A. crassa between two different source levels of tidal turbine sound suggests the frequency composition of turbine sound is more relevant in explaining such responses rather than sound intensity. These results show that estuarine mudflat sound mediates natural metamorphosis behaviour in two common species of estuarine crabs, and that exposure to continuous turbine sound interferes with this natural process. These results raise concerns about the potential ecological impacts of sound generated by renewable energy generation systems placed in the nearshore environment.",,,,,,,,,38,2,0,0,28,0,43,,,1932-6203,,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Auckland, Leigh Marine Lab, Auckland 1, New Zealand",,,,2013-01-09,WOS:000312290800099,23240063,

In this study, the structural reliability of such structures subjected to pitting corrosion-fatigue is assessed using a damage tolerance modelling approach. A probabilistic model that ascertains the reliability of the structure is presented, incorporating the randomness in cyclic load and corrosive environment as well as uncertainties in shape factor, pit size and aspect ratio. A non-intrusive formulation is proposed consisting of a sequence of steps. First, a stochastic parametric Finite Element Analysis (FEA) is performed using SMART (c) crack growth and Design Xplorer (c) facilities within the software package ANSYS. Secondly, the results obtained from the FEA are processed using an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) response surface modelling technique. Finally, the First Order Reliability Method (FORM) is used to calculate the reliability indices of components. The results reveal that for the inherent stochastic conditions, the structure becomes unsafe after the 18th year, before the attainment of the design life of 20 years. The FEA results are in very good agreement with results obtained from analysis steps outlined in design standard BS 7910 and other references designated as 'theoretical analysis methods' in this study. The results predict, for the case study, that the pit growth life is approximately 56% of the total pitting corrosion fatigue life.

(2017), Bunnik et.al. (2018)). However, there is still a lack of efficient methods and tools to properly analyze wave impacts and derive the statistical variation of these impacts in the sea states to which these structures are exposed during their lifetime.To reduce the statistical uncertainties that are naturally arising in estimates of design loads related to extreme waves, sufficient data must be gathered. In order to estimate the design loads it is common practice not to investigate all possible sea states (i.e. long-term analysis) but to investigate a few sea states and assume that the design value occurs at a prescribed probability level in the sea states with the same probability level (i.e. contour line approach). The estimate of the design value at that probability level is then based on results from a limited number of random realizations of these sea states. For linear or weakly nonlinear response types it is possible to estimate design loads accurately with a quite limited number of realizations. For strongly nonlinear problems however this is not possible due to the large statistical variation in the maximum observations, inherent to a random nonlinear process. Estimating accurately the tail of the load distribution requires many more realizations. This approach is restricted by time and costs and eventually one may have to accept an estimated design load with a large statistical uncertainty and account for the uncertainty with a higher safety margin.In this paper an improved methodology for estimating design loads related to extreme wave impacts will be presented. The methodology is based on screening many 3-hour realizations of the design sea states with simplified, fast but sufficiently accurate methods and to focus only on the potentially critical events with a model containing a more complete description of the physics. This can be either a model test or a non-linear impact simulation (i.e. CFD analysis). By doing this many more rare/critical events can be assessed, reducing the statistical uncertainty in the estimate of the design load. A screening method/wave impact indicator will be presented for a jacket platform and for a fixed offshore wind turbine. Existing model test data is used to show the correlation between indicator and actual impact events and to derive the efficiency of the impact indicators.",,,,,"38th ASME International Conference on Ocean, Offshore and Arctic Engineering (OMAE 2019)38th ASME International Conference on Ocean, Offshore and Arctic Engineering (OMAE 2019)","JUN 09-14, 2019JUN 09-14, 2019","ASME, Ocean Offshore & Arctic Engn Div; Univ Strathclyde, Dept Naval Architecture Ocean & Marine EngnASME, Ocean Offshore & Arctic Engn Div; Univ Strathclyde, Dept Naval Architecture Ocean & Marine Engn","Univ Strathclyde, Glasgow, SCOTLANDUniv Strathclyde, Glasgow, SCOTLAND",4,0,0,0,0,0,4,,,2153-4772,,978-0-7918-5876-9,,,,,,,,,"MARIN, Wageningen, Netherlands",MARIN,,,2020-02-28,WOS:000513068400061,,

Economical, maintenance and operation are critical issues for large slender dynamic structures, especially for remote offshore wind farms. Health monitoring systems are very promising instruments to assure reliability and good performance of the structure. These sensing and control technologies are typically informed by models based on mechanics or data-driven identification techniques in the time and/or frequency domain. Frequency response functions are popular but are difficult to realize autonomously for structures of higher order and having overlapping frequency content. Instead, time-domain techniques have shown powerful advantages from a practical point of view (e. g. embedded algorithms in wireless-sensor networks), being more suitable to differentiate closely-related modes. Customarily, time-varying effects are often neglected or dismissed to simplify the analysis, but such is not the case for wind loaded structures with spinning multi-bodies. A more complex scenario is constituted when dealing with both periodic mechanisms responsible for the vibration shaft of the rotor-blade system, and the wind tower substructure interaction. Transformations of the cyclic effects on the vibration data can be applied to isolate inertia quantities different from rotating-generated forces that are typically non-stationary in nature. After applying these transformations, structural identification can be carried out by stationary techniques via data-correlated Eigensystem realizations. In this paper an exploration of a periodic stationary or cyclo-stationary subspace identification technique is presented here by means of a modified Eigensystem Realization Algorithm (ERA) via Stochastic Subspace Identification (SSI) and Linear Parameter Time-Varying (LPTV) techniques. Structural response is assumed under stationary ambient excitation produced by a Gaussian (white) noise assembled in the operative range bandwidth of horizontal-axis wind turbines. ERA-OKID analysis is driven by correlation-function matrices from the stationary ambient response aiming to reduce noise effects. Singular value decomposition (SVD) and eigenvalue analysis are computed in a last stage to get frequencies and mode shapes. Proposed assumptions are carefully weighted to account for the uncertainty of the environment the wind turbines are subjected to. A numerical example is presented based on data acquisition carried out in a BWC XL.1 low power wind turbine device installed in University of California at Davis. Finally, comments and observations are provided on how this subspace realization technique can be extended for modal-parameter identification using exclusively ambient vibration data.",,,,,"Conference on Sensors and Smart Structures Technologies for Civil, Mechanical, and Aerospace SystemsConference on Sensors and Smart Structures Technologies for Civil, Mechanical, and Aerospace Systems","MAR 10-14, 2013MAR 10-14, 2013",SPIE; Amer Soc Mech EngineersSPIE; Amer Soc Mech Engineers,"San Diego, CASan Diego, CA",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,0277-786X,1996-756X,978-0-8194-9475-7,,,,,,,,,"Michigan Technol Univ, Houghton, MI 49931 USA",,,,2013-09-18,WOS:000323283300044,,

Nevertheless, this power system restoration practice strongly relies on conventional power plants, e.g. large thermal power plants. As future global goals aim at reducing the use of fossil fuels and lowering carbon-dioxide emissions, conventional power plants are often taken out of operation. These are characterised by slow start-up times and considerable use of fossil fuels. In this context, large offshore wind farms (OWFs) show potential as renewable-based black start (BS) service providers. These can be equipped with a self-starter, e.g. synchronous generators or innovative power-electronic-based converters, such as battery energy storage systems (BESSs) and/or grid-forming wind turbines in order to BS the system. Additionally, state-of-the-art complementary devices such as STATCOMs or synchronous condensers can help with dynamic regulation and support the OWF both in island operation and BS. In this paper, an overview of different system configurations for OWF BS is presented. Firstly, the requirements for BS from non-conventional power plants are outlined. Afterwards, the challenges faced by OWFs to fulfil these requirements are identified.

Not only is it used in newly built and existing offshore structures (e.g. oil and gas (O&G) production & process facilities (P&PFs), wind turbine installations, etc.), but SIC is also essential for ageing offshore platforms which are subjected to an extension of their design service life. In these cases, SIC programs must be performed to assess the platforms. If any significant changes in structural integrity (SI) are discovered, then it is essential to implement an appropriate strengthening, modification and/or repair (SMR) plan. Currently, welded and grouted repairs are mostly used for SMR. Although a welded repair may typically restore a structure to its initial condition, if the damage is due to fatigue loading and welded repairs have been carried out, then historical evidence reveals that there is a high potential for the damage to reappear over time. On the other hand, mechanical connections are significantly heavier than grouted connections. Consequently, grouted repairs are widely used to provide additional strength, for instance, to handle situations such as preventing propagation of a dent or buckle, sleeved repairs, leg strengthening, clamped repair for load transfer, leak sealing and plugging, etc. This manuscript examines current developments in grouted connections and their comparative pros and cons in relation to welded or mechanical connections.

Harbour porpoises occurred regularly around the turbine site in all years, but there was some evidence that porpoises did respond to disturbance from installation activities.

Leading edge erosion results in reduced turbine efficiency that requires expensive repairs and tip speeds to be limited to protect blade edges. A review of the existing protection solutions is presented. The production and application of both gelcoats and flexible coatings relies heavily on manual procedures, leaving the coatings vulnerable to defects that can act as initiation points for erosion. Leading edge tapes are manufactured autonomously in a controlled environment and are consequently relatively free of defects. When applied effectively, the tapes possess very good erosion resistance. However, poor application can result in the formation of air pockets and wrinkles that reduce the adhesion of the bond, resulting in the tape disbonding from the blade. Metallic erosion shields have been shown in accelerated rain erosion tests to possess a lifetime greater than that of an offshore wind turbine blade. However, differences in stiffness between the blade and the metallic shield introduces a risk of the shield detaching under loading and as a result, the reliance on the adhesive is high. Integrating a metallic erosion shield into the blade mould would remove an additional manufacturing process and alleviate any aerodynamic concerns caused by a profile step on the leading edge of the blade. A design that can account for the stiffness mismatch between an integrated metallic erosion shield and the blade may then reveal the solution to leading edge erosion.",,,,,,,,,83,3,0,0,2,0,89,,,1364-0321,1879-0690,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Bristol, Dept Aerosp Engn, Queens Bldg, Bristol BS8 1TR, Avon, EnglandOffshore Renewable Energy Catapult, Offshore House,Albert St, Blyth NE24 1LZ, EnglandNatl Composites Ctr, Bristol & Bath Sci Pk, Bristol BS16 7FS, Avon, England",Offshore Renewable Energy CatapultNatl Composites Ctr,,,2019-11-19,WOS:000493957000030,,

Wind energy is one of clean energy forms during the operation phase of the project, but it includes some environmental pollution during other stages of its life cycle such as manufacturing and dismantling of the wind turbines.The aim of this study is to analyze and evaluate the LCA and real impact of the first wind farm to be installed in Libya considering the whole life cycle. This wind farm is located in Dernah, east coast of Libya. The analysis revealed that the energy payback period is 0.475 year (5.7 months), and the pay back ratio is 42.1, which confirms very well with other results in the literature. The electricity generated by one wind turbine 1.65 MW (model M. Torres (TWT 1.65/82)) land based in this wind farm is expected to emit approximately 10.42, 0.02713, 0.03823, 0.0001474, 0.0001065, 0.0003469 and 0.0112237 g m per kWh CO2, SO2, NOX, N2O, CH4, NMVOC and CO respectively. The results obtained in this study confirm that wind energy produces the lowest CO2 emissions per kWh of electricity (similar to 10 g m/kWh) compared to fossil fuel and other renewable energy sources. By recycling the wind turbine material the specific emissions of CO2 is 4.65 g m/kWh of energy generated. The amount of fuel savings is 85,700 m(3)/year or 79,013,800 kg(fuel)/year, which is equivalent to $2,804,900/year (more than fifty six million dollars over the life time of the wind farm) if the local subsidized price of HFO was considered. The savings could reach a value as high as $63,404,570/year ($1.3 x 10(9) over the entire life time of the wind farm) if the international prices of HFO were considered. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

The idea of adding a wave energy harvester to a floating or a fixed-support wind turbine structure contributes to increase the system reliability. Thus, a mathematical model was used to assess not only the components of the wind-wave hybrid system (e.g., wind turbine, wave converter, and foundation), but also the system costs and the cost recovery period. The wave energy converter selected for the hybrid device was a Wavestar prototype combined with a wind turbine. The engineering and economic improvements of the system and associated costs were calculated. Two case studies of the proposed hybrid system in the eastern Mediterranean Sea and the North Sea were assessed. It was concluded that the annual energy production from the wind-wave hybrid device in the North Sea was 64.3% higher than that in the Mediterranean Sea.

Fiber-reinforced polymer composites, with their superior structural properties (e.g., high stiffness-to-weight) that allow lightweight and robust designs, play a significant part in the design and manufacture of modern wind turbines, especially turbine blades, for demanding service conditions. However, with the current global growth in onshore/offshore wind farm installations (with total global capacity of similar to 282GW by the end of 2012) and trend in wind turbine design (similar to 7-8MW turbine capacity with similar to 70-80m blade length for offshore installations), one of the challenges that the wind energy industry faces with composite turbine blades is the aspect of structural maintenance and repair. Although wind turbines are typically designed for a service life of about 20 years, robust structural maintenance and repair procedures are essential to ensure the structural integrity of wind turbines and prevent catastrophic failures. Wind blades are damaged due to demanding mechanical loads (e.g., static and fatigue), environmental conditions (e.g., temperature and humidity) and also manufacturing defects. If material damage is not extensive, structural repair is the only viable option to restore strength since replacing the entire blade is not cost-effective, especially for larger blades. Composite repairs (e.g., external and scarf patches) can be used to restore damaged laminate/sandwich regions in wind blades. With composite materials in the spar (similar to 30-80mm thick glass/carbon fiber laminates) and aerodynamic shells (sandwich sections with thin glass fiber skins and thick foam/wood as core), it is important to have reliable and cost-effective structural repair procedures to restore damaged wind blades. However, compared to aerospace bonded repairs, structural repair procedures in wind blades are not as well developed and thus face several challenges.

Further, the results are used to investigate the potential of event-based use of control strategies developed to reduce fatigue loads through active load mitigation.

Avian collisions with wind turbines have received wide attention but reliable predictions remain elusive. Existing predictive models consider behavioural factors such as group movement only implicitly and require accurate site-specific data to produce predictions, making them difficult to translate between locations. Here we introduce an individual-based modelling approach to describe group interactions with obstacles that incorporates aspects of collective motion to simulate and quantify likely avoidance behaviour. We quantify the effect of group size on the probability of an individual colliding with a fixed obstacle, and investigate the roles of both navigational efficiency and group cohesion. We show that, over a wide range of model assumptions and parameterisations, social interactions have a significant and potentially large effect on collision risk; in contrast to previous models, collision risk is typically a non-linear function of group size. These results show that emergent behaviour induced by social interactions can have important effects on the metrics used to inform management and policy decisions. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Offshore wind energy is progressively attained at greater water depths, beyond 30 m, where jacket foundations are presently the best solution to cope with the harsh environment (extreme sites with poor soil conditions). Structural integrity is of key importance in these underwater structures. In this work, a methodology for the diagnosis of structural damage in jacket-type foundations is stated. The method is based on the criterion that any damage or structural change produces variations in the vibrational response of the structure. Most studies in this area are, primarily, focused on the case of measurable input excitation and vibration response signals. Nevertheless, in this paper it is assumed that the only available excitation, the wind, is not measurable. Therefore, using vibration-response-only accelerometer information, a data-driven approach is developed following the next steps: (i) the wind is simulated as a Gaussian white noise and the accelerometer data are collected; (ii) the data are pre-processed using group-reshape and column-scaling; (iii) principal component analysis is used for both linear dimensionality reduction and feature extraction; finally, (iv) two different machine-learning algorithms, k nearest neighbor (k-NN) and quadratic-kernel support vector machine (SVM), are tested as classifiers. The overall accuracy is estimated by 5-fold cross-validation. The proposed approach is experimentally validated in a laboratory small-scale structure.

A range of future UK energy scenarios has been employed to determine their resulting environmental and carbon footprints. Methodologies have been established to calculate these footprints for the UK electricity supply industry on both a historic timescale and in accordance with the three selected scenarios. The latter scenarios, developed by the UK SUPERGEN Consortium on 'Highly Distributed Power Systems' (HDPS), were characterised as 'Business As Usual' (BAU), 'Low Carbon' (LC) and 'Deep Green' (DG) futures, and yielded possible electricity demands out to 2050. It was found that the environmental footprint of the current power network is 41 million (M) global hectares (gha). If future trends follow a 'Business As Usual' scenario, then this footprint is observed to fall to about 25 Mgha in 2050. The LC scenario implies an extensive penetration of micro-generators in the home to satisfy heat and power demands. However, these energy requirements are minimised by way of improved insulation of the building fabric and other demand reduction measures. In contrast, the DG scenario presupposes a network where centralised renewable energy technologies - mainly large-scale onshore and offshore wind turbines - have an important role in the power generation. However, both the LC and DG scenarios were found to lead to footprints of less than 4 Mgha by 2050. These latter two scenarios were found to give rise to quite similar trajectories over the period 2010-2050. They are therefore more likely to reflect an effective transition pathway in terms of meeting the 2050 UK CO2 reduction targets associated with decarbonisation of its power network.

The floater is the Triple Spar floater, a hybrid between a spar buoy and a semi submersible tri-floater, tested here for the first time. The turbine is a model scale version of the DTU 10 MW reference wind turbine, which, also for the first time, is tested with active blade pitch control. The tests focus on the effects of aerodynamic damping and interaction effects between the wind forcing, wave forcing and the blade pitch control algorithm. Special focus is devoted to the instability of the platform pitch natural mode, that can occur if a standard land-based controller is applied.Results of three control strategies are reported: Fixed blade pitch, a standard land-based controller, and a tuned controller designed to eliminate the instability. Special rotor ID tests were carried out to characterize the rotor and identify the control parameters. Results for regular waves, focused wave groups, a wind-only test and irregular waves are presented in terms of time series, power spectra and exceedance probability plots. Among the key results are the wind-induced steady offset of floater pitch and surge and the aerodynamic damping of the floater pitch motion. Further, a clear example of the onset of unstable motion at the platform natural pitch frequency is provided along with a detailed analysis of the dynamic response for irregular wave conditions with the three control strategies. The paper ends with the first results of numerical re-modelling of the response for a waves-only test. A good match is found, thus encouraging further work in this direction. (C) 2017 The Authors.

To evaluate the environmental sustainability and technical/financial feasibility of offshore wind farm expansion, the German Federal Government has decided to encourage the renewable offshore sector, among other things, with a comprehensive scientific research project (Research at Alpha Ventus (RAVE)) [1]. The RAVE project startet 2008 with first marine observations 2010. Purpose of this project is to enhance the sparely investigated knowledge of impacts of the harsh marine conditions with regard to construction and operation in offshore regions. Within this project, extensive oceanographic investigations are carried out. The measured oceanographic data is a basic dataset to the entire accompanying research, both for the technical aspects as for the environmental and geological investigations. Furthermore the influences of offshore structures and facilities should be examined with respect to shelf sea physics and vice versa. The present study shows results from five years of oceanographic measurements regarding to construction and operation of offshore wind farms. For that reason the focus is on sea state observations (installation, maintenance and data analysis) which have a major impact on the operational management of offshore facilities. In this paper, measurements with directional wave rider buoys, various radar level gauges (sea state parameters calculated from water level data) and ADCPs (with option to measure sea state) are compared and evaluated to their physical limits, ambient conditions, accuracies, as well as technical advantages and disadvantages. A better understanding of the instruments helps to optimize the measurement concepts in terms of type, number, measurement time and locations. In consequence this can lead to an improvement of offshore energy production facility design, robustness and dimensioning. Additional benefits can be an optimization of facility locations and access times during facility construction and maintenance, cost reduction as well as improved energy production rates.",,,,,"11th IEEE/OES Conference on Current, Waves and Turbulence Measurement (CWTM)11th IEEE/OES Conference on Current, Waves and Turbulence Measurement (CWTM)","MAR 02-06, 2015MAR 02-06, 2015",IEEE; OESIEEE; OES,"St Petersburg, FLSt Petersburg, FL",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,978-1-4799-8419-0,,,,,,,,,"Fed Maritime & Hydrog Agcy, Bernhard Nocht Str 78, D-20359 Hamburg, Germany",Fed Maritime & Hydrog Agcy,,,2016-09-08,WOS:000380426700001,,

Here we report the results of three postdevelopment experiments testing the effects of a small wind park on the abundance, distribution, and behavior of wintering Common Eiders (Somateria mollissima), a large sea duck. Our approach was based on the rationale that the probability of detecting an impact should increase with decreasing distances from the wind park. Because prey abundance is likely to drive the distribution of wintering ciders, we removed that confounding variable by (1) randomizing its effect over the study area, and (2) incorporating the variable into the analysis. In the first experiment, we compared the abundance and distribution of eiders when wind turbines were switched on and off. This was complemented by investigating the escape behavior of flocks when wind turbines were switched on after they had been off for one full day. In a second experiment, we tested for any departure from the habitat-matching rule, which states that the proportion of eiders and the proportion of food should be equal at different distances from the park. In a third experiment, the flying behavior of eiders in relation to the wind park was analyzed by measuring the landing and flying rates for patches of decoys located at 100, 300, and 500 m from the wind park. We found little evidence for negative impacts, because we could not detect any effect in three tests out of four. Only in the decoy experiment did we observe eiders reducing their landing and flying near (100 m from) the wind park. We conclude, for the conditions under which our experiments were performed, that the wind park did not substantially affect wintering Common Eiders. However, many aspects of the potential impacts of offshore wind parks on sea ducks have not been covered by our study and, therefore, cannot be generalized to other species or other phases of the annual cycle. Nevertheless, we argue that the use of multiple postdevelopment experiments based on a gradient approach is a helpful complement to BACI studies.",,,,,,,,,24,0,0,0,18,0,30,,,1051-0761,,,,,,,,,,,"Natl Environm Res Inst, Div Coastal Zone Ecol, DK-8410 Ronde, Denmark",,,,2002-06-01,WOS:000175693800026,,

These are usually evaluated in terms of rigid body dynamic response of a floating platform which supports whole FOWT. To investigate the dynamic response of array of FOWT, we put forward the concept of a large FOWT farm which consists of nine spar-type wind turbine array and meanwhile shares mooring line system by connecting those FOWT to one another. The whole FOWT is established based on OC3-Hywind spar buoy platform with NREL 5MW wind turbine. Considering effects of wind, wave and current loads, the dynamic response of the proposed FOWT was conducted based on FEM software ANSYS AQWA under both operational condition and survival condition. Besides, comparisons of dynamic response between the original single FOWT and the proposed FOWT farm were also made. Several interesting conclusions were gained through the investigation. For the original single FOWT, RAO in surge, heave and pitch are concentrated in low frequency, while the peak value of frequency is about 0.2 rad/s. In addition, FOWT (P1, P3, P7 and P9) located on the four vertices of 3x3 have higher sway motion which range from about -0.15 m similar to 0.15 m, while sway motion of the rest can be neglected. With the worsening of environmental condition, surge motion of the original single FOWT increases significantly, while it's not significant for the proposed FOWT farm. At the same time, statistic values of pitch motion of the proposed FOWT farm are quite close to those of the original single FOWT. While, under the survival condition, range of pitch motion of the proposed FOWT farm is significantly smaller than that of the original single FOWT.

Assessments of the potential numbers of bird collisions are required prior to the construction of wind farms. Collision rate models (CRMs) are used as a tool to estimate numbers of collision victims for wind farm initiatives.In the past couple of decades various CRMs have been developed. These models are all based on the theoretical calculation of collision probabilities (theoretical models).In this paper we introduce an empirical model, the Flux Collision Model (FCM), in which actual knowledge of species (group)-specific collision probabilities collected in existing wind farms on land is used to calculate collision rates for planned wind farms.An important quality of the FCM is that it provides a means to use empirical information to assess collision rates in Environmental Impact Assessments (ETAS) for wind farm initiatives. In addition, no detailed information on bird behaviour close to the rotor is needed, as this information is already incorporated in the empirical collision probability.In two case studies, one offshore and one on land, we compare and discuss the use and performance of the empirical FCM and the theoretical SOSS Band model for predicting collision rates of birds at wind farm initiatives. To date, no actual collision rates are known for the offshore situation. Accordingly, in the FCM, collision probabilities derived from wind farms on land were used. Nevertheless, in the offshore case study, the results of the FCM were comparable with those of the SOSS Band model.Basic sensitivity analyses for both the FCM and the SOSS Band model showed that purely theoretically both models are equally sensitive to changes in avoidance rates. However, because lower values for avoidance are applied in the FCM (wind farm avoidance) than in the SOSS Band model (overall avoidance), in practice the effect of realistic variation in avoidance rates on the resulting collision rates is much smaller for the FCM than for the SOSS Band model.Our results show that the FCM provides a valuable addition to the existing suite of (theoretical) CRMs. The predictive value of the theoretical SOSS Band model is constrained by the limited availability of knowledge on species (group)-specific (wind turbine) avoidance rates, which is not the case for the FCM. By contrast, the reliability of the empirical FCM is determined only by variation in the availability and quality of information on species (group)-specific collision probabilities.The choice of which CRM to use (theoretical or empirical) seems not to depend on the location of the wind farm initiative as being offshore or on land, but on the availability and reliability of species (group)-specific information in existing wind farms. The availability of a reliable collision probability supports the use of the FCM, while the availability of information on (overall) avoidance rates in the absence of a species (group) specific collision probability supports the use of a theoretical CRM like the SOSS Band model.Synthesis and applications. The predictive power of collision rate models relies in the first place on the quality of the input information, and second on the theoretical details of the model calculations. Although the FCM is less dependent on measurements of avoidance rates, an urgent need remains to obtain information on actual collision rates and corresponding collision probabilities as well as avoidance rates in existing wind farms both offshore and on land in order to accurately determine the impact of wind energy on bird populations.",,,,,,,,,9,0,0,0,6,0,9,,,0304-3800,1872-7026,,,,,,,,,,"Bur Waardenburg Bv, Varkensmarkt 9,POB 365, NL-4100 AJ Culemborg, NetherlandsDeltares, Boussinesqweg 1,POB 177, NL-2600 MH Delft, NetherlandsRoyal Netherlands Air Force, Nat Bur, POB 8762, NL-4820 BB Breda, NetherlandsStat Netherlands, POB 24500, NL-2490 HA The Hague, NetherlandsSjoerd Dirksen Ecol, Julianaweg 167, NL-3525 VD Utrecht, Netherlands",Bur Waardenburg BvRoyal Netherlands Air ForceStat NetherlandsSjoerd Dirksen Ecol,,,2018-12-28,WOS:000451653800014,,

In this paper a fuzzy-based damage detection method, using dynamic response of the FWT structure, is proposed. In the first step, the nonlinear motion equations of the FWT system are derived using the theorem of angular momentum and Newton's second law. Then the variation values of the mean amplitude of dynamic response and frequency characteristics of the structure due to stiffness changes of mooring lines (simulated damage) are considered as input features to the fuzzy system. Also the fuzzy system is trained based on calibrating of the membership functions by defining the damage classes properly. The proposed method is applied on two types of the FWT, Tension Leg Platform (TLP) and Spar. The simulation results show that the proposed method is able to identify the damage classes with acceptable success rate (SR). (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Like the rest of the world there has been a dramatic increase in wind farm development In Australia over the last two decades but none of this has occurred in the offshore environment. Australian wind farms are predominantly located onshore around the southern part of the continent where wind energy is high. This has specifically affected rural coasts where it has created planning and land use policy issues along with environmental impacts and associated public and political reaction. This paper examines the geographic spread, timing and concentration of Australian wind farms around the coast. It also examines the extent to which scientific knowledge on wind farm impacts is incorporated into different state and federal land use and environmental policy and legislative frameworks. The paper concludes that the rapidity in the expansion of the Australian wind energy sector has outpaced strategic land use planning resulting in a piece-Meal and cumulative wind farm development on rural coasts.

The 10 MW drivetrain bedplate is designed based on extreme design loads and ultimate limit state (ULS) design criteria. A decoupled analysis approach is employed. Global dynamic analysis of the 10 MW floating turbine is firstly conducted using an aero-hydro-servo-elastic code, then the global response is used as input to the drivetrain dynamic analysis. Load effects and fatigue damage of gears and bearings in the rigid and flexible bedplate models in different environmental conditions are compared. In addition, sensitivity of the drivetrain fatigue damage to varying fidelity in the bedplate modelling is studied. The results indicate that the bedplate flexibility would increase the load effects on bearings inside the gearbox, while it would reduce the load effects on the main bearings. Reasonable bedplate modelling fidelity is of great importance, because it could save a great deal of computational costs without loss of the drivetrain dynamic response accuracy. The present work provides a reference for a proper drivetrain design and dynamic analysis in the future, by accounting for bedplate flexibility. (C) 2020 The Authors.

The need to know, well in advance, certain design parameters prior to installation thus arises, and through numerical analyses, ranges for these installation parameters, and the behavior of the sand surrounding the pile can be estimated. Offshore environment poses an additional challenge of taking into account not only the penetration process and effects of dynamic loading of the sand, but also the pore pressure built up in the soil skeleton. This paper presents a novel approach to simulate the dynamic installation process of open-ended piles in saturated soil. Thus, the simulation also provides the basis to predict the pile behavior due to axial or lateral loading considering the installation effects. By coupling the aspects of Lagrangian and Eulerian methods, a particle-based method, called Material Point Method (MPM), more specifically its extension called Convected Particle Domain Interpolation (CPDI) method has been employed in the present work. To simulate saturated media, an extension of CPDI is incorporated in the form of 2-phase formulation, different velocities for soil and water are considered and thus able to capture precisely the saturated-soil behavior. A 2-D axisymmetric model is considered, along with a penalty method formulation to calculate contact forces between pile and soil. This method, when applied in conjunction with the hypoplastic constitutive model, provides a framework which allows us to study detailed effects of pile installation on the surrounding soil.",,,,,Mini-Symposium on Induced Seismicity / 2nd International Symposium on Energy Geotechnics (SEG)Mini-Symposium on Induced Seismicity / 2nd International Symposium on Energy Geotechnics (SEG),"SEP 25-28, 2018SEP 25-28, 2018","Int Soc Soil Mech & Geotechn Engn, Tech Comm 308 Energy GeotechnInt Soc Soil Mech & Geotechn Engn, Tech Comm 308 Energy Geotechn","Swiss Inst Technol Lausanne, Lausanne, SWITZERLANDSwiss Inst Technol Lausanne, Lausanne, SWITZERLAND",2,0,0,0,0,0,2,,,1866-8755,1866-8763,978-3-319-99670-7; 978-3-319-99669-1,,,,,,,,,"Univ Stuttgart, Geotech Inst, Stuttgart, Germany",,,,2020-08-26,WOS:000558273700057,,

The number of offshore wind farms is rapidly increasing as they are a critical part of many countries' renewable energy strategies. Quantifying the likely impacts of these developments on wildlife is a fundamental part of the impact assessments required in many regions before permission for developments is granted. A key concern related to wind turbines is the risk of birds colliding with turbine blades. We present a novel method to generate species-specific flight height distributions which can be used to improve the assessment of collision risk by better reflecting the proportion of in-flight populations at risk of collision.2. Data describing the flight heights of birds from surveys of 32 potential offshore wind farm development sites were combined to estimate continuous distributions for 25 marine bird species. Observations of flying birds assigned to discrete height categories were treated as observations from independent multinomial distributions with a shared underlying continuous distribution. This analysis enables calculation of the uncertainty around the estimates of the proportion of the in-flight population at risk and consideration of different turbine designs.3. The mean r(2) for model fit across species was 085, and for seven of the species, good independent model validation (80% of independent observations within 95% confidence intervals) provides some confidence for use of the results at alternative sites.4. All species exhibited positively skewed flight height distributions. These results demonstrate that under the conditions in which the data were collected, raising hub height and using fewer, larger turbines are effective measures for reducing collision risk.5. Synthesis and applications. The methods presented here for modelling continuous flight height distributions provide measures of uncertainty and enable comparison of collision risk between different turbine designs. This approach will improve the accuracy of impact assessments and provide estimates of uncertainty, allowing better evidence to inform decision-making.",,,,,,,,,62,0,0,0,51,0,69,,,0021-8901,1365-2664,,,,,,,,,,"British Trust Ornithol, Thetford IP24 2PU, Norfolk, EnglandUniv Stirling, Sch Biol & Environm Sci, British Trust Ornithol Scotland, Stirling FK9 4LA, Scotland",,,,2014-02-12,WOS:000329846500005,,

The framework is founded on a probabilistic characterization of the uncertainty in the models for the excitation, the turbine and its performance. Risk is then quantified as the expected value of some risk consequence measure over the probability distributions considered for the uncertain model parameters. Stochastic simulation is proposed for the risk assessment, corresponding to the evaluation of some associated probabilistic integral quantifying risk, as it allows for the adoption of comprehensive computational models for describing the dynamic turbine behavior. For improvement of the computational efficiency, a surrogate modeling approach is introduced based on moving least squares response surface approximations. The assessment is also extended to a probabilistic sensitivity analysis that identifies the importance of each of the uncertain model parameters, i.e. risk factors, towards the total risk as well as towards each of the failure modes contributing to this risk. The versatility and computational efficiency of the advocated approaches is finally exploited to support the development of standalone risk assessment applets for automated implementation of the probabilistic risk quantification/assessment (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Constant soil-structure and structure-environment (wave and wind) interaction calls for comprehensive understanding of structural behavior under complex loading patterns. Due to the dynamics of the Wind Turbine Generator (WTG), dynamic response of the substructure and foundation should fall in pre-defined, narrow band response spectrum. Procurement and fabrication of these structures is another limiting constraint to consider in the design process. Availability and limitations of manufacturers and simplicity of construction are critical parameters in the successful design process. Most of the structural components need to be transported to the installation site in the sea and then installed with specialized marine vessels. Both the transportation and installation of offshore wind farm substructures and foundations utilize expensive marine equipment and the offshore processes are weather limited. Keystone Engineering's Inward Battered Guided Structure (IBGS) provides an optimum solution to the challenges of design, manufacturing, transportation and installation in a range of shelf water depths. Flexible design configurations provide freedom for the designer to add or remove elements without loss of structural integrity, to allow adjustment adjust for resonance response avoidance. Efficiency is achieved in manufacturing by reducing the number of members and weldments and thus, minimizing the lifts of subassemblies. Ease of transportation with marine vessels is improved by reducing the footprint space requirements and the choreographed installation procedure can lower the vessel charter costs significantly. These design considerations make IBGS an efficient choice for substructure and foundation of offshore wind farms.",,,,,Structures CongressStructures Congress,"APR 23-25, 2015APR 23-25, 2015","Amer Soc Civil Engineers, Struct Engn InstAmer Soc Civil Engineers, Struct Engn Inst","Portland, ORPortland, OR",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,978-0-7844-7911-7,,,,,,,,,"Keystone Engn Inc, Offshore Renewables, 3500 N Causeway Blvd,Suite 1100, Metairie, LA 70002 USA",Keystone Engn Inc,,,2015-01-01,WOS:000392737000150,,

However, they have complex ecological consequences, especially their negative effects on birds. The East China coast is a key part of the East Asian-Australasian flyway (EAAF) for migratory waterbirds, and numerous wind farms have been or will be built in this region owing to high electricity demand and wind energy resources. However, little is known regarding the effects of large-scale wind farms of the East China coast on biodiversity conservation. The negative effects of wind farms on waterbirds that overwinter here could be reduced by understanding waterbird distribution and movement around wind turbines in these areas. From 2017 to 2019, we selected the Chongming Islands as our study area, which are one of the most important hot spots for migratory waterbirds of the East China coast and have sufficient wind generation potential to achieve energy sustainability, to study how to coordinate coastal wind farm development (existing and planned wind farms) and waterbird conservation (important waterbird habitats and buffer zone due to characteristic of waterbird activity). We identified four coastal natural wetlands of international importance for waterbirds according to 16 field surveys in 2017-2018. We found that over 63.16% species and 89.86% of waterbirds flew regularly across a dyke in Chongming Dongtan, where the wind farms are generally located, and used the natural intertidal wetland as a feeding ground and artificial habitat behind the dyke as a supplementary habitat for foraging and roosting. Additionally, with 4603 locations of 14 GPS/GSM tracked waterbirds (seven shorebirds and seven ducks) in Chongming Dongtan in 2018-2019, we further demonstrated that more than 60% of waterbird locations were within a distance of 800-1300 m from the dyke, and this distance could be defined as a buffer zone to protect waterbirds. Finally, we found that 67 existing wind turbines adjacent to four important coastal habitats on the Chongming Islands may influence waterbirds based on our finding of the buffer zone for waterbird conservation. We concluded that the settlement of wind farms should be avoided not only in important coastal natural wetlands for waterbird conservation but also in a proper buffer zone covering the artificial wetlands, such as aquaculture ponds and paddy fields adjoining these important natural wetlands.

At present, the vast majority of wind power is generated from onshore wind farms. However, their growth is limited by the lack of inexpensive land near major population centers and the visual pollution caused by large wind turbines. Comparing with onshore wind power, offshore winds tend to flow at higher speeds than onshore winds, thus it allows turbines to produce more electricity. Estimates predict a huge increase in wind energy development over the next 20 years. Much of this development will be offshore wind energy. This implies that great investment will be done in offshore wind farms over the next decades. For this reason, offshore wind farms promise to become an important source of energy in the near future. In this study, history, current status, investment cost, employment, industry and installation of offshore wind energy in Europe are investigated in detail, and also compared to its onshore counterpart.

The device used to harness tidal current energy is the tidal current turbine, which shares similar working principle with wind turbines. The high load factors resulting from the fluid properties and the predictable resource characteristics make marine currents particularly attractive for power generation. There is a paucity of information regarding various key aspects of system design encountered in this relatively new area of research. Not much work has been done to determine the characteristics of turbines running in water for kinetic energy conversion even though relevant work has been carried out on ship's propellers, wind turbines and on hydro turbines. None of these three well established areas of technology completely overlap with this new field so that gaps remain in the state of knowledge. A tidal current turbine rated at 1-3 m/s in water can result in four times as much energy per year/m(2) of rotor swept area as similarly rated power wind turbine. Areas with high marine current flows commonly occur in narrow straits, between islands, and around. There are many sites worldwide with current velocities around 2.5 m/s, such as near the UK, Italy, the Philippines, and Japan. In the United States, the Florida Current and the Gulf Stream are reasonably swift and continuous currents moving close to shore in areas where there is a demand for power. In this study tidal current turbines are designed for several high tidal current areas around USA for a tidal current speed range from 1 m/s to 2.5 m/s. Several locations around USA are considered, e.g. the Gulf Stream; Mississippi River, St. Clair's river connecting Lake Huron to Lake St. Clair's; Colorado River  within Cataract Canyon etc. Tidal current turbines can be classified as either horizontal or vertical axis turbines. In this study several designs from both the classifications are considered and modeled using SolidWorks. Hydrodynamic analysis is performed using SolidWorks Flow simulation software, and then optimization of the designs is performed based on maximizing the starting rotational torque and ultimate power generation capacity. From flow simulations, forces on the tidal current turbine blades and structures are calculated, and used in subsequent stress analysis using SolidWorks Simulation software to confirm structural integrity. The comparative results from this study will help in the systematic optimization of the tidal current turbine designs at various locations.",,,,,ASME International Mechanical Engineering Congress and Exposition (IMECE2015)ASME International Mechanical Engineering Congress and Exposition (IMECE2015),"NOV 13-19, 2015NOV 13-19, 2015",ASMEASME,"Houston, TXHouston, TX",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,978-0-7918-5744-1,,,,,,,,,"Kennesaw State Univ, Dept Mech Engn, Marietta, GA 30060 USAWayne State Univ, Dept Mech Engn, Detroit, MI 48202 USA",,,,2016-08-03,WOS:000379703400036,,

However, there are a number of challenges in offshore; wind turbines are subject to different loads that are not often experienced onshore and more importantly challenging wind and wave conditions limit the operability of the vessels needed to access offshore wind farms. As the power generation capacity improves constantly, advanced planning of Operation and Maintenance (O&M) activities, which supports the developers in achieving reduced downtime, optimised availability and maximised revenue, has gained vital importance. In this context, the focus of this research is the investigation of the most cost-effective approach to allocate O&M resources which may include helicopter, crew transfer vessels, offshore access vessels, and jack-up vessels. This target is achieved through the implementation of a time domain Monte-Carlo simulation approach which includes analysis of environmental conditions (wind speed, wave height, and wave period), operational analysis of transportation systems, investigation of failures (type and frequency), and simulation of repairs.

In this sense, the interaction between wakes has become a relevant aspect for the definition of a wind farm layout, for the assessment of its annual energy yield and for the evaluation of wind turbine fatigue loads. For this reason, accurate models for multiple overlapping wakes are a main concern of the wind energy community. Existing engineering models can only simulate single wakes, which are superimposed when they are interacting in a wind farm. This method is a practical solution, but it is not fully supported by a physical background. The limitation to single wakes is given by the assumption that the wake is axisymmetric. As an alternative, we propose a new shear-layer model that is based on the existing engineering wake models but is extended to also simulate non-axisymmetric wakes. In this paper, we present the theoretical background of the model and four application cases. We evaluate the new model for the simulation of single and multiple wakes using large-eddy simulations as reference. In particular, we report the improvements of the new model predictions in comparison to a sum-of-squares superposition approach for the simulation of three interacting wakes. The lower deviation from the reference considering single and multiple wakes encourages the further development of the model and promises a successful application for the simulation of wind farm flows.",,,,,,,,,2,0,0,0,0,0,2,,,2366-7443,2366-7451,,,,,,,,,,"Carl von Ossietzky Univ Oldenburg, Inst Phys, ForWind, Kupkersweg 70, D-26129 Oldenburg, Germany",,,,2017-12-06,WOS:000416160100001,,

Whilst interaction effects are widely studied for shallow foundations, the limited research on this topic for pile foundations often produces conflicting results. This paper reviews the research of the influence of vertical loading on the lateral response of pile foundations under combined loads, from the perspective of analytical research, numerical research, and experimental research from tests performed on 1-g (gravitational acceleration) model, centrifuge, and full-scale piles.

The main objective of this work is to analyse the energy that could be obtained from a hybrid wave-wind farm located in an optimum area for the exploitation of both resources. Such a farm, consisting of offshore wind turbines and co-located Wave Energy Converters (WECs), would realise the synergies between wave and offshore wind energy.

Offshore wind energy is however expensive due to the large capital expenses. The construction of an offshore wind farm encounters many challenges throughout its construction processes. Therefore inner sea offshore wind farms receive increasing interest, due to their assumed attractive features of reduced costs of erection and operation. The aim of this paper is to identify the challenges encountered during the installation phase of offshore wind turbines at inner sea conditions, understood as the Baltic Sea region and neighbouring areas. Offshore wind farm installation is conceptualised as a building operation. Consequently, theories on construction management, operations management and strategy, supply chain, building logistics and concepts on offshore wind farm development were used. A qualitative approach using interviews and literature. Out of seven farms in operation in the southern Baltic, Oresund and Kattegat, two were selected. Interviews were conducted with professionals that were involved in installation of Anholt and Lillgrund. The analysis showed that installation challenges can either be due to local natural conditions or technical issues related to equipment, planning, technology and work practices. At Lillgrund challenges were bad weather conditions and breakdown of a vessel, causing a delay of export cable installation and the tight tolerances for the bolts at the tower-foundation interface. At Anholt, a soft seabed necessitated the abandonment of some turbine positions. Irregular supply by the turbine supplier forced the vessel operator to change planning, andit was needed to handle gas leaks from the sea bed. Installation challenges grows as wind turbines are becoming bigger and heavier and locations go further from shore.

The most critical technique of the foundation is the self-floating towing technique based on a reasonable subdivision inside the bucket. To predict the dynamic behaviors of the LPCBF in waves supported by the air cushion, the hydrodynamic software MOSES is used to simulate the three-dimensional motion of the foundation in the towing construction site. The prototype foundation models are established using MOSES with a water draft of 4 m, 5 m, and 6 m in given environmental conditions. The results show that the hydrodynamic responses of the large floater with air cushions depend not only on the wave conditions but also on the mass of the water column, air cushion height, and air pressure distribution. In addition, the hydrodynamic characteristics can be tuned resulting in small dynamic responses in a particular sea state by changing the draft and water plug height. The floating technique of the LPCBF with supported air cushions in waves is highly competitive for saving cost while using few expensive types of equipment during the towing transportation.

The analysis accounts for typical factors affecting the wind farm operation, the wake effect and the forecast errors on wind availability. A two-stage optimisation model determines the day-ahead and (close to) real-time operation of the turbines, which profit from selling energy at the wholesale market (including subsidies), receiving availability payments for frequency services, while facing imbalance costs due to mismatches between forecasted and available wind. The two control strategies are applied to the Teesside Offshore Farm and the economic and financial performance are evaluated against a base case where the turbines do not provide frequency response service.

JOHN'S,,OCEANS-IEEE,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Proceedings Paper,2014,2014,"Assessment of the potential impact of underwater acoustic noise from both construction and operation of almost all human marine activities is now commonplace within many international regulatory frameworks. More recent industries like offshore renewables (wind, wave and tidal) have experienced an increasing requirement to understand how their energy conversion devices interact with existing acoustic environments and what their potential for impacts might be. Assessing the potential for impact, however, results in a number of measurement challenges, for example, many of these devices represent highly complex, multi-modal, distributed sources which can be anything from arrays of many small (few meters) devices to larger systems with dimensions of hundreds of meters. The systems can also vary in nature from a floating device, for example a wave energy surface attenuator, or can be distributed throughout the water column, as can be the case for both wave and tidal systems, or wind turbine. In the case of an offshore wind turbine for example, the device is coupled to the seabed, and extends throughout the water column and in to the air. This distribution and configuration can make the measured acoustic characteristics strongly dependent on the environment, with the potential for propagation through the seabed, water and air, with complex interactions, particularly between the seabed and waterborne components of the sound.The environments themselves are also often acoustically complicated. For example, many of the devices are being developed in relatively shallow water where there is often strong bathymetric variation, and other natural and manmade noise sources. The devices themselves often also exhibit time variant characteristics. They can become more energetic with tidal speed, wave height wind speed increase, for example. Furthermore, these properties also alter the 'natural' acoustic environment or baseline condition.The relationship between device noise and background or ambient noise is also likely to be fundamental to the effect these devices have on marine species, for example, by causing a change in behaviour or creating a masking effect. It may effect the detection capability of an animal, which may be important for collision avoidance. This paper discusses analysis of some of these challenges in the context of a number of emerging technology types. In particular, the paper considers the dynamically varying nature of the ratio of the noise radiated from the device to the background noise. Data is presented of the operational noise levels against the background noise levels, under different seastates for a full-scale attenuator wave energy system.",,,,,Oceans ConferenceOceans Conference,"SEP 14-19, 2014SEP 14-19, 2014",,"St Johns, CANADASt Johns, CANADA",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,0197-7385,,978-1-4799-4918-2,,,,,,,,,"Univ Loughborough, Loughborough, Leics, EnglandNatl Phys Lab, Acoust Grp, Teddington TW11 0LW, Middx, England",,,,2014-01-01,WOS:000369848800180,,

The motions of the turbine may be considerably high in severe sea-states and therefore they need to be operational after transition of such states. This work proposes a novel controller technique and its application in tension leg platform(TLP) supported OWT to harvest optimized power. It is achieved using the nonlinear quadratic regulator based algorithm wherein the state dependent structural system matrices are modified appropriately to account for the fluctuating dynamics. Three wind speeds (15 m/s, 21 m/s and 25 m/s) along with turbulence intensity of 0.1 are selected which are above the rated wind speed as the controller mechanism is effective for those regions. Since the wind and wave loads are taken as random, Monte Carlo method is used for the analysis to rule out epistemic uncertainty by ensemble statistics. The results show that the proposed nonlinear quadratic regulator is able to control the power, generator torque and rotor speed effectively without additional increase in platform motions vis-a-vis existing conventional Baseline controller. It is also observed that there are lesser fluctuations using the proposed controller compared to existing controller. The ensemble statistics -maxima and mean- are close to the reference value when wind speeds are close to rated-wind speed; whereas the platform motions and tower base forces is less using the proposed NQR controller or at least similar to the Baseline controller. The ensemble standard deviation are far less which shows the output power is controlled effectively.",,,,,,,,,5,1,0,0,0,0,5,,,0951-8339,1873-4170,,,,,,,,,,"Indian Inst Technol Madras, Dept Ocean Engn, Chennai 600036, India",,,,2019-02-21,WOS:000458228900017,,

Since hybrid power systems are mostly used in remote areas where grid-connection may be unavailable; these systems must be self-sufficient in frequency and voltage control. In this paper, other power elements are introduced to provide reliable service to the system load and simulated the wind turbine generator with DL showing graphs for frequency, voltage and active and reactive power for the elements of the system. These elements are called balancing mechanisms, as they balance the system's power output to match the load consumption. Fuel Cells, batteries, dump loads (DL), and fossil fuel based generation have been used as balancing mechanisms. Hybrid power system is simulated and the performance analysis is done in a user friendly MATLAB/Simulink environment.

The collision risk is often assessed by measuring avian flight heights. Therefore, we measured flight height distributions of 15 seabird taxa, abundant in German offshore waters, with an optical laser rangefinder (n = 2508 measurements). For lesser black-backed gulls, we compared these rangefinder measurements to flight heights recorded by GPS data loggers which were attached to 17 birds during incubation. Both methods have specific advantages and disadvantages. Rangefinder measurements are only possible during the day, and rain or fog prevents successful measurements. Data were negatively biased against low and very high flight heights. Since measuring low-flying birds proved more difficult during application of the method in the field, observers should be instructed to dedicate extra effort to measure low-flying birds. Visual observations of low-flying birds can also help to reduce uncertainty and overcome bias problems. Flight heights ranged from - 3 to 431 m above sea level. Most seabirds (70%) flew below rotor level (30 m), but about 30% (mainly large gulls and cormorants) flew in the rotor-swept area. GPS height measurements show a similar general pattern of flight height distribution as rangefinder measurements. However, this method is restricted to few individuals.

Mooring cable dynamics is strongly nonlinear resulting from the geometric effect, hydrodynamic loads and probably seabed interactions. Time-domain methods are commonly used for numerical simulation. This study formulates a nonlinear frequency domain multi-harmonic balance method for efficient analysis of a mooring cable subjected to periodic fairlead motions. The periodic responses are of particular interest to investigate the mooring effect on the platform. In the formulation, the governing equations of the three-dimensional cable motions are spatially discretized using the finite difference method; the nonlinear ordinary differential equations are subsequently transformed into the frequency domain by expanding both the structural responses and the nonlinear nodal forces using truncated Fourier series, leading to a set of nonlinear algebraic equations of the Fourier coefficients. The equations are eventually solved using Newton's method where the alternating frequency/time domain method is used to handle the nonlinearity effect. The presented method is then compared to a time-domain method by numerical studies of a mooring cable. The results show that the method is of comparable accuracy as the time-domain method while it is generally more efficient. The proposed method shows promising results even when the cable tension becomes non-positive for a period of time during the cable motion, which is a known ill-posed problem for time-domain methods.

Up to now, extensive efforts for development of design tools for FOWTs have been made, and nowadays several design tools are available. Needless to say, it is of utmost importance that the engineering design tools have been verified and validated for the real physical phenomena before being applied to real designs/projects with confidence. Much efforts have thus been made as code-to-code comparisons and by validations using model test data. Validations of the design tools using full-scale field data for FOWTs have also been made, but available open literatures are quite limited, particularly for design-driving extreme cases. In this paper, we describe the analysis of the dynamic response of a 2-MW spar-type FOWT at the time of typhoon attack in the actual sea area. The central atmospheric pressure of the typhoon at the closest time was 965 hPa, the maximum instantaneous wind speed at the hub height was 52.2 m/s, and the maximum significant wave height was 6.9 m. The dynamic responses under the typhoon environment are numerically simulated by using the time-series records of the wind speed, the wind direction, the wave height, the wave direction, the current speed, and the current direction which were acquired during the typhoon passing through close to the FOWT. Then the simulated motion responses are compared with the measured motion responses for the same durations. By the comparisons, the numerical simulation tool which was used for the design of the FOWT has been partially validated. It has also been confirmed that the spatial coherence of the wind speed has a significant effect for the platform motions, particularly for yaw motion.y",,,,,,,,,16,0,0,0,0,0,17,,,0029-8018,1873-5258,,,,,,,,,,"TODA CORP, Chuo Ku, Kyobashi 1-18-1, Tokyo 1040031, JapanKyushu Univ, Dept Marine Syst Engn, Nishi Ku, Motooka 744, Fukuoka 8190395, JapanHitachi Ltd, Kokubuncho 1-1-1, Hitachi, Ibaraki 3168501, Japan",TODA CORP,,,2021-01-19,WOS:000598977600109,,

A three-dimensional finite element model was developed to investigate the behavior of large-diameter piles. The model accounts for nonlinear dynamic interactions in offshore platforms under harsh combined moment and horizontal environmental loads, with emphasis on the cyclic mobility of the surrounding cohesionless subsoil and associated shear. The maximum moment applied in the cyclic analyses is varied from 18% to 47% of the ultimate resistance. The considered data reflect behavior at the expected load amplitudes and cycle numbers during the service life of operation. For low numbers of load cycles (< 1000 cycles), there were no differences between the power law and logarithmic approaches in terms of describing the accumulated deformations; however, for high numbers of cycles (< 10,000 cycles), the logarithmic law was less suited to describe the accumulation response. Magnitude of cyclic loads was found to cause a linear increase in the accumulated rotation.

Increasingly, offshore wind turbines (OWTs) are being installed close to shipping lanes, which puts them at risk of potential collisions with ships during their service period. This article aims to investigate the structural dynamic response of OWTs to a ship collision. Considering the structure size of the fender as well as the nonlinear characteristics of the structural materials, a finite element model of a 5,000-ton ship colliding with a 4-MW tripod OWT has been developed using the explicit finite element code LS-DYNA. By observing the collision energy conversion, contact force, fender performance, Von Mises stress on the tripod, shear stress, and dynamic response of a nacelle in differently sized fender collision scenarios, it was observed that when the thickness of the fender surpasses 1.1 m, it can protect the OWT from a collision more effectively than with no fender case. Otherwise, the local contact force is cushioned by aluminum foam materials, whose contact force leads to a whole movement of the bearing tripod. The tripod with the aforementioned 1.1-m fender generates a contact force, Von Mises stress, and a shear stress, as well as the anticollision characteristics of a fender and the dynamic responses of a nacelle in 15 scenarios. Therefore, the structural design of the fender is essential in the safety of a tripod foundation in a collision.

In this paper, aero-hydro-servo-elastic simulations for a model of a turbine are used to assess its loads and any changes in the dynamics under healthy state and a damaged configuration case study. To prove the feasibility of the damage detection through low-resolution data, the statistics of the typically recorded signals from the SCADA and the structural monitoring systems are fed into a database for training and testing of classification algorithms. The ability of the machine learning models to generalise the classification for both stochasticity and uncertainties in the environmental conditions are tested. Decision tree-based classifiers showed the capability to capture the damage for the majority of the operating conditions considered. Though the setup of the traditional SCADA sensors had to be supplemented with an additional structural health monitoring sensor, the detection of the damage has been shown feasible by referring to low-frequency statistics only.",,,,,17th EERA Deep Sea Offshore Wind R and D Conference (EERA DeepWind)17th EERA Deep Sea Offshore Wind R and D Conference (EERA DeepWind),"JAN 15-17, 2020JAN 15-17, 2020",European Energy Res Alliance; NTNU; Res Council NorwayEuropean Energy Res Alliance; NTNU; Res Council Norway,"SINTEF, Trondheim, NORWAYSINTEF, Trondheim, NORWAY",1,0,0,0,0,0,1,,,1742-6588,1742-6596,*****************,,,,,,,,,"Univ Strathclyde, Naval Architecture Ocean & Marine Engn Dept, Glasgow G1 1XQ, Lanark, ScotlandRamboll Deutschland GmbH, D-20095 Hamburg, Germany",Ramboll Deutschland GmbH,,,2021-04-04,WOS:000631743300021,,

The lateral bearing behavior and failure mechanism are significant topics for optimizing its design criteria. In this study, a group of centrifuge tests were performed to investigate the lateral bearing capacity of suction bucket foundation with three aspect ratios. Force-controlled lateral static and cyclic tests were performed at a centrifuge acceleration of 50 g. Four soil conditions were considered in centrifuge tests with a combination of loose/dense and dry/saturated sand. The load-displacement and the stiffness-displacement relationships are presented in the paper, and it is concluded that the lateral bearing capacity can be reached when the normalized lateral displacement (displacement divided by the bucket diameter) reached 3% as the first method. Displacement rates are plotted against the lateral load to give the second method for defining the ultimate lateral capacity. In cyclic tests, the lateral displacement and stiffness are correlated to the cycle numbers in the first 5 cycles, but the change is less apparent in the rest. The results demonstrated the behavior of bucket foundation in service conditions.

Especially, the lack of access of offshore installations increases inspection and maintenance costs. The installation of a condition monitoring system will cause a decisive impact on reliability and maintenance and considerably reduce down times by condition dependent inspections. So far, such systems are installed only in a low percentage of the wind turbines. Furthermore, there is a limitation on monitoring of changes in Eigen frequencies. Usually, this type of information does not provide a spatial resolution necessary for damage detection and localization of structural changes. The current work at Fraunhofer IZFP Dresden in the field of monitoring of wind turbines is focused on the development of a condition monitoring systems for rotor blades. The monitoring concept is based on a combination of low frequency integral vibration monitoring and acoustic monitoring techniques in the frequency range between 10 kHz and 100 kHz using guided waves. The paper is focused on the results of the acoustic emission measurements that were used in a full-scale fatigue test at a rotor blade made from carbon-and glass fiber reinforced plastics (CFRP, GFRP) with an overall length of 40 meters. The spatial and temporal development of the acoustic emissions and their signal parameters can be used as damage indicator. Moreover, the test instrumentation and results of acoustic emission measurements on a rotating rotor blade are shown. When using acoustic emission on such a field installation one has to overcome additional parameters caused by environmental influences like rain and wind speed to name a few of them.

By combining the axial force and the bending moment, the stress around the circumference can be calculated. This study investigates the effect of second order wave force, wind load, mooring model, and tower elasticity on the stress response at tower base. There are three peaks in the stress amplitude spectrum, corresponding to pitch resonance, wave frequency, and first-order natural mode of the tower, respectively. The first and third peaks are mainly induced by wind load. The effect of the second order wave force and mooring model on the stress seems to be neglectable based on the numerical results. By using the rainflow counting method, the fatigue damage is calculated. The obtained fatigue damage under several environmental conditions indicates that the misalignment and coupling effect of wind and wave loads may significantly affect the total fatigue damage. The wind and wave induced responses are calculated separately (uncoupled method). Next, two superposition methods for fatigue damage calculation are analyzed: fatigue damage superposition and stress superposition. Compared with the fully coupled analysis considering wind and wave together, the former gives lower prediction but the latter seems to provide acceptable results. Finally, considering the long-term wind and wave distribution, the fatigue damage under different environmental conditions is calculated, and the fatigue damage obtained from stress superposition method shows reasonable agreement with that obtained from a fully coupled analysis.

Currently, the role of wind power is not included in the renewable energy mix of Malaysia and diversification of the renewable energy mix needs to be encouraged to include policy support for other sources of energy. The wind speed Malaysia is ranged from 3-7 m/s and most wind turbine requires 5 m/s as cut in speed. The low average wind speeds causes wind turbine to be the least cost-effective method to generate electricity at Malaysia especially at the west coast. Therefore, low-energy wind harvesting device is proposed as alternative at this climate. This device is also intended to generate power from vehicle-induced wind. Three potential configurations (electromagnetic, piezoelectric or electrostatic) for small-scale energy harvesting device were proposed by previous researchers and studied in this work. Electromagnetic configuration of energy harvesting by fluttering was selected after analysis of three configurations. A wind belt was designed to withstand environmental conditions such as fresh water (rain), UV radiation and acid/alkali conditions. Several important parameters such as belt width, location of the magnet etc for the design were evaluated experimentally. Taffeta silk was selected as the belt materials from potential materials. The optimum length and width of the belt in this study are 1 m and 12 mm. Neodymium N45 magnet was selected based on inductance and the optimum magnet position along the belt is 20cm from the edges of the main frame.

This paper presents a new foundation model for integrated analyses of monopile-based OWTs. The model follows the macro-element approach, where the response of a pile and the surrounding soil is condensed to a force-displacement relation at seabed. The model formulation uses multi-surface plasticity and it reproduces key characteristics in monopile foundation behaviour that are not accounted for in current industry practice. The basic features of the model are described and its limitations are discussed. The performance of the macro-element model is compared against field test measurements and results from FEA. The comparison indicates that the macro-element model can reproduce accurately the non-linear load-displacement response and hysteretic behaviour measured in field tests and computed in FEA. This confirms that the model can simulate the pile and soil behaviour with the same level of accuracy as FEA, but with a considerable reduction in computational effort.",,,,,,,,,41,0,0,0,0,0,42,,,0029-8018,,,,,,,,,,,"Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol NTNU, Trondheim, NorwayNorwegian Geotech Inst, Oslo, Norway",,,,2018-12-28,WOS:000447576900003,,

The model uses generalized displacements and a semi-analytical approach to establish the equations of motion for the system, which are solved in the frequency domain. The results show agreement within +/- 30% for the long-term fatigue considering operational conditions, however, the linear fatigue damage estimates are sensitive to the accuracy of the estimated natural frequency of the first bending mode. The results also suggest that a small number of environmental conditions can be simulated with a nonlinear time domain model to verify and possibly tune the linear model, which then can be used to run the full long-term analysis. Short-term extreme tower base bending moments and surge and pitch motions are observed to be nearly Gaussian above cut-out wind speed, as the response is dominated by wave forces. Consequently, the linear model is able to accurately capture the uperossing rates, which are used to calculate the characteristic largest extreme response. For an operational case near rated wind speed, the response is somewhat non-Gaussian, which gives larger discrepancies between the linear and nonlinear models.

The estimated annual offshore wind and solar power generation for 2030 are 11343 GWh and 11367 GWh, respectively. Based on these results, it appears that the annual power supply can easily help balance the total power demand. However, the power demand is high during the summer peak months, and power generation may be insufficient during peak summer hours by 2030. Specifically, in 2024, the peak hourly percent reserve margin (PRM) in summer will be negative (-0.9%). If the installation of offshore wind turbines and solar panels is delayed, then the problem of insufficiency will be even more severe. However, if the offshore wind and solar photovoltaic projects are completed on schedule, and the first, second, and third nuclear power plants (NPPs) extend their service to 2030, then the hourly PRM could reach 15% during the summer peak hours from 2025 to 2030 and 5-11% in the other years.

In multi-terminal HVDC (MTDC) schemes incorporating offshore wind farm this issue could be addressed by setting aside a reserve of wind energy by the curtailment of wind turbine generators (WTGs).This paper proposes a communication-less dc voltage cooperative control strategy for MTDC transmission systems. A grid side converter, the master, and a wind farm are designed to work cooperatively to maintain a stable dc link voltage, facilitating normal power dispatch orders and the provision of frequency support. The proposed control maintains a wind energy reserve and uses a flexible dc link voltage at the master converter. Allowing the local master dc voltage to vary within certain limits encourages the wind farm to participate in dc link voltage control and hence no communication system is required. The master converter automatically assumes control of the dc link voltage in the absence of wind or when the wind reserve is used up.A four terminal MTDC system comprising one master converter, two active/reactive power converters and one wind farm is studied. The effectiveness of the proposed control strategy is validated through simulation using MATLAB((R))-SIMULINK (R). (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Existing collision-risk models take into account parameters of wind turbines and bird flight behavior to estimate collision probability and mortality rates. Two behavioral characteristics these models require are the proportion of birds flying at the height of the rotor swept-zone and the flight speed of birds passing through the rotor swept-zone. In recent studies, investigators have measured flight height and flight speed of migrating birds using fixed-beam radar and thermal imaging. These techniques work well for fixed areas where migrants commonly pass over, but they cannot readily provide species-specific information. We measured flight heights of a nesting shorebird, the federally threatened Piping Plover (Charadrius melodus), using optical range finding and measured flight speed using videography. Several single-turbine wind projects have been proposed for the Atlantic coast of the United States where they may pose a potential threat to these plovers. We studied Piping Plovers in New Jersey and Massachusetts during the breeding seasons of 2012 and 2013. Measured flight heights ranged from 0.7 to 10.5 m with a mean of 2.6 m (N = 19). Concurrent visually estimated flight heights were all within 2 m of measured heights and most within 1 m. In separate surveys, average visually estimated flight height was 2.6 m (N = 1674) and ranged from 0.25 m to 40 m. Average calculated flight speed was 9.30 m/s (N = 17). Optical range finding was challenging, but provided a useful way to calibrate visual estimates where frames of reference were lacking in the environment.

Regarding strength, the monopile is designed to have sufficient capacity to withstand demands under both 50-year operational conditions, when the rotor is spinning and blades are oriented to optimize power generation, and 50-year extreme conditions, when the rotor is parked and the blades feathered to minimize aerodynamic loads. Regarding stiffness, the monopile is designed to have sufficient stiffness such that the first structural frequency of the OWT falls between the 1P and 3P frequencies (rotation frequency and blade passing frequency for a three-bladed turbine). For six case studies, including three sites along the U.S. Atlantic coast and two mudline conditions (fixed and compliant), this paper delineates the conditions under which stiffness and strength govern the design of the monopile. This distinction has important implications for the overall risk profile of an OWT, as monopiles controlled by stiffness will have more reserve capacity than monopiles controlled by strength. The six case studies are intended to consider a range of water depths, metocean environments and mudline conditions that is representative of conditions suitable for installing OWTs supported by monopiles along the U.S. Atlantic coast. The monopile designs are controlled by stiffness for two of the six cases studies and, for these two cases, a modest (6-8%) reduction in monopile area (and mass) could be achieved if dynamic design requirements were achieved through means other than increasing monopile stiffness. Monopile designs for the remaining four cases are controlled by operational moment demands. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

In this review, we propose a new and complementary hypothesis describing the biophysical processes intervening in the recruitment of temperate fish larvae into estuaries. This new hypothesis, the Sense Acuity And Behavioral (SAAB) hypothesis, recognizes that recruitment is unlikely if the larvae drift passively with the water currents, and that successful recruitment requires the sense acuity of temperate fish larvae and their behavioral response to the estuarine cues present in coastal areas. We propose that temperate fish larvae use a hierarchy of sensory cues (odor, sound, visual and geomagnetic cues) to detect estuarine nursery areas and to aid during navigation towards these areas. The sensorial acuity increases along ontogeny, which coincides with increased swimming capabilities. The swimming strategies of post-flexion larvae differ from offshore areas to the tidal zone. In offshore areas, innate behavior might lead larvae towards the coast guided by a sun compass or by the earth's geomagnetic field. In areas under limited influence of estuarine plumes (either in energetic nearshore areas or offshore), post-flexion larvae display a searching swimming behavior for estuarine disconnected patches (infotaxis strategy). After finding an estuarine plume, larvae may swim along the increasing cue concentration to ingress into the estuary. Here, larvae exhibit a rheotaxis behavior and avoid displacement by longshore currents by keeping bearing during navigation. When larvae reach the vicinity of an estuary, merging diel rhythms with feeding and predator avoidance strategies with tidally induced movements is essential to increase their chances of estuarine ingress. A fish larva recruitment model developed for the Ria Formosa lagoon supports the general framework of the SAAB hypothesis. In this model, the ingress of virtual Sparidae temperate larvae into this nursery area. increases from 1.5% to 32.1% when directional swimming guided by estuarine cues is included as a forcing parameter.

Wind turbine noise was only measurable above ambient noise at frequencies below 500 Hz. Total sound pressure level was in the range 109-127 dB re 1 mu Pa rms, measured at distances between 14 and 20 m from the foundations. The 1/3-octave noise levels were compared with audiograms of harbor seals and harbor porpoises. Maximum 1/3-octave levels were in the range 106-126 dB re 1 mu Pa rms. Maximum range of audibility was estimated under two extreme assumptions on transmission loss (3 and 9 dB per doubling of distance, respectively). Audibility was low for harbor porpoises extending 20-70 m from the foundation, whereas audibility for harbor seals ranged from less than 100 m to several kilometers. Behavioral reactions of porpoises to the noise appear unlikely except if they are very close to the foundations. However, behavioral reactions from seals cannot be excluded up to distances of a few hundred meters. It is unlikely that the noise reaches dangerous levels at any distance from the turbines and the noise is considered incapable of masking acoustic communication by seals and porpoises.

This paper presents a cost breakdown structure (CBS) and develops a whole life cost (WLC) analysis framework for offshore wind farms throughout their life span (similar to 25 years).A combined multivariate regression/neural network approach is developed to identify key cost drivers and evaluate all the costs associated with five phases of offshore wind projects, namely pre-development and consenting (P&C), production and acquisition (P&A), installation and commissioning (I&C), operation and maintenance (O&M) and decommissioning and disposal (D&D). Several critical factors such as geographical location and meteorological conditions, rated power and capacity factor of wind turbines, reliability of sub-systems and availability and accessibility of transportation means are taken into account in cost calculations. The O&M costs (including the cost of renewal and replacement, cost of lost production, cost of skilled maintenance labour and logistics cost) are assessed using the data available in failure databases (e.g. fault logs and O&M reports) and the data supplied by inspection agencies. A net present value (NPV) approach is used to quantify the current value of future cash flows, and then, a bottom-up estimate of the overall cost is obtained.The proposed model is tested on an offshore 500-MW baseline wind farm project, and the results are compared to experimental ones reported in the literature. Our results indicate that the capital cost of wind turbines and their installation costs account for the largest proportion of WLC, followed by the O&M costs. A sensitivity analysis is also conducted to identify those factors having the greatest impact on levelized cost of energy (LCOE).The installed capacity of a wind farm, distance from shore and fault detection capability of the condition monitoring system are identified as parameters with significant influence on LCOE. Since the service lifetime of a wind farm is relatively long, a small change in interest rate leads to a large variation in the project's total cost. The presented models not only assist stakeholders in evaluating the performance of ongoing projects but also help the wind farm developers reduce their costs in the medium-long term.",,,,,,,,,80,3,0,0,0,0,86,,,0948-3349,1614-7502,,,,,,,,,,"Cranfield Univ, Ctr Offshore Renewable Energy Engn, Coll Rd, Bedford MK43 0AL, Beds, England",,,,2016-07-13,WOS:000378079900003,,

The transmission and distribution system models are based on the actual existing regional FirstEnergy/PJM power grid in Midwestern of United State.In addition, the impact of installing Static VAR Compensator (SVC) at Points of 'Interconnection (POI) on voltage regulation is investigated.",,,,,2015 IEEE Power & Energy Society Innovative Smart Grid Technologies Conference (ISGT)2015 IEEE Power & Energy Society Innovative Smart Grid Technologies Conference (ISGT),"FEB 18-20, 2015FEB 18-20, 2015",,"Washington, DCWashington, DC",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,978-1-4799-1785-3,,,,,,,,,"Case Western Reserve Univ, Dept Elect Engn & Comp Sci, 10900 Euclid Ave, Cleveland, OH 44106 USA",,,,2016-09-13,WOS:000380535300128,,

This combined wind-solar-aquaculture (WSA) system is intended to utilize the ocean space and water resources more effectively and more economically, while greatly shortening the payback period of investment in offshore power generation. The details of this WSA design are described, showing that a square-shaped fishing cage serves as a floating foundation for the 7600 m(2) solar array and four multi MW VAWTs. The WAMIT program based on potential-flow theory is employed to obtain the WSA's motion response amplitude operators (RAOs) in sinusoidal waves of varying periods. The motion RAOs indicated that the proposed concept possesses better hydrodynamic seakeeping performances than its OC3Hywind spar and OC4DeepCwind semi-submersible counterparts. A potential site located in the northwest South China Sea is selected to deploy the WSA. Its feasibility is then examined in terms of the hydrodynamic motions and structural dynamic response driven by wind, waves, and current. Fully coupled time-domain simulations are carried out for 50-year survival conditions. The whole structure exhibits outstanding performance for its small motions in random wind and seas. Moreover, under these survival conditions, the top accelerations and tower base stresses of the VAWTs and mooring line tensions readily meet the design requirements.

The results indicated a postlarval seasonal immigration pattern, with the lowest average density values from March to May and October to November, and significantly higher values from June to September; maximum peaks occurred in June and September. High Pls densities were obtained between one and three hours after the tidal inflow started. Temperature and salinity varied little during each sampling period and had no apparent effect on immigration, but did have an effect on the seasonal abundance cycle. The multiple regression models indicated that the tidal current velocity and the temperature explained 86% of the variation in Pls abundance during immigration to the Terminos lagoon.

Hence, an important cost consideration is minimizing the number of soundings for an offshore project while ensuring reliable and safe designs. This study examines the possibility of reducing the number of soundings at site by using practical numerical tools to predict cone tip resistance (q(t)) at unsampled locations. Prediction errors were quantified within a probabilistic framework. Two prediction approaches, i.e. 2D linear regression and Kriging, were adopted. Site investigation data from an existing offshore wind farm with homogeneous stiff clay deposit were collected and analyzed. Result shows that in a homogeneous soil deposit, it is possible to use as little as 20% of the available data to predict the remaining 80% q(t) profiles with small error. Monopile deformation under typical design load was also calculated using shear strength derived from the q(t) profile at each wind turbine location.

Initial work suggested a possible control by energy content and energy expense in young stages. The present work aimed to better understand the mechanisms involved, by studying the influence of the salinity rearing environment in the loss of mass and therefore on fish energy and migration. Glass eels (Anguilla anguilla L) caught on the Atlantic coast were identified according to their rheotactic response to the dusk signal, and thus to their propensity to migrate which can be low (sedentary. M- fish) or high (flow-wise catches in early night, M+ fish). M+ and M- fish were individually placed at different salinities (0, 10 or 30) for 28 days in small containers equipped with shelters. Individual wet mass and pigmentary stage were determined on Day 1 and Day 28. In addition, dry mass and percent dry mass were measured on a sub-sample of 30 fish randomly chosen on Day 1, and on all fish on Day 28. There was no difference in the loss of mass linked to their adaptation to salinity between M- and M+ fish, and so the results do not support the link between migratory behaviour and salinity tolerance (or to a larger extent osmoregulation). However, M- fish lost more wet mass than M+ fish irrespective of the salinity, maybe because of a higher standard metabolism, which suggests that glass eels prone to loose more energy might choose to settle at sea or in estuary. In addition, the highest percent dry mass after 28 days in seawater associated to the highest loss of mass in 28 days in seawater does not support a higher energy cost of osmoregulation at sea.

However, impact of wind energy industry on the environment still requires to be fully understood and better quantified. This study provides an updated review of Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) studies of electricity produced from onshore and offshore wind turbines (WTs). Special emphasis is put on results harmonization and simplified LCA models existing in the literature. The synthesis of the results is performed for wide range of WTs capacities, providing an exhaustive and general frame of the environmental impacts of WTs systems. Moreover, new simplified LCA models, which make use of a non-linear regression, were developed in this work for the following impact categories: Acidification Potential (AP), Eutrophication Potential (EP), Global Warming Potential (GWP) and Cumulative Energy Demand (CED) and for onshore (1-5000 kW) and offshore (500-8000 kW) WTs. Nonlinear data fitting models are provided with a sufficiently high correlation coefficient for total life cycle impacts. Moreover, the proposed simplified LCA models predict the final results with acceptable uncertainty. This indicates that the one-term power series describes the behavior of the impact indicators accurately, providing a useful correlation to estimate the life cycle environmental performance for a specific turbine model with a given nominal power. Furthermore, obtained simplified LCA models were generalized for different site-specific wind conditions, i.e. wind speeds and wind classes. By analyzing all the considered impact indicators for electricity generation, we notice that the highest values of life cycle impacts of electricity, for a particular WT correspond to the highest wind velocities. This is particularly valid for low nominal power turbines, which seem to be significantly affected by wind conditions. The trends exhibit an asymptotic behavior, indicating that, on the contrary, wind conditions are a minor contributor to the environmental impact of large-scale systems.",,,,,,,,,55,1,0,0,9,0,57,,,1364-0321,,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Florence, Via S Marta 3, I-50139 Florence, ItalyNiccolo Cusano Univ, Via Don Carlo Gnocchi 3, I-00166 Rome, Italy",,,,2019-06-27,WOS:000471252700032,,

As importantly, the manufacturing of wind turbine blades, towers, and balance of plant components has become a key contributor to local economies in some Latin American countries and is contributing to a nascent industry throughout the region. Future expansion of wind resources in both regions will likely require significant investments in transmission as the best wind resources are located distant from existing urban demand centers. Also, the usually strong public support in both regions should be accompanied with a defined strategy to avoid a growing resistance in some communities opposing large-scale wind production.

Visitors as well as hotel managers have, however, a positive attitude towards the responsible use of energy resources. The level of research on visitors' preferences of using different types of renewable energy is low, unlike findings on factual characteristics of conventional and renewable energies. That is why our aim was to assess visitors' preferences of environmentally friendly energy sources in hotels. Preferences of six types of renewable energy - green tariff energy, solar panels on the rooftops, solar panels on the ground, heat pumps, AD, wind turbine, were measured at four tourist destinations in the Czech Republic. The positive attitude of tourists towards the selected types of energy sources was confirmed. The highest preferences were found for solar panels installed on the rooftops. A typology of preferences was revealed by cluster analysis and differences between clusters were tested for independent variables. Clusters of visitors with a high and low interest in any type of renewable energy were identified as well as a cluster of visitors with interest in all types apart from solar panels installed on the ground - the visitor's origin was found as the main differentiation factor.

Marine current has huge potential to supply renewable energy as compared to the other energy sources. Marine environment is harsh for the installation and operation of marine current turbine (MCT). Seabed scour around marine current turbine is induced when the flow suppression occurs at the seabed. Seabed scour is widely recognised as a difficult engineering problem which is likely to cause structural instability. The study found that the previous works mainly focus on the bridge piers, wind turbines and ship propeller jets induced scour. Little information to date was found to predict the MCT induced scour. The current paper proposes the potential equations to predict the MCT induced scour. The study also recommends the consideration of the rotor into the existing equations for future research.

There is a rapid increase in the number of wind farms at suitable sites all over the country. Some of the key sites with optimal wind velocities are the plateaus on the Western Ghats - a global hotspot of biological diversity. The rocky plateaus on the Western Ghats are terrestrial habitat islands facing extreme micro-environmental conditions; however, scanty information is available on the ecology of these plateaus. We undertook a two-year study to assess the impact of wind farms on birds. We also documented the avian diversity at Bhambarwadi Plateau, northern Western Ghats, India. To the best of our knowledge this is the first such study in India. We recorded 89 avian species on the plateau, 27 of which flew in the risk area swept by the rotor blades, and hence are potentially at risk of collision. The collision index (the number of bird collisions with wind turbines over a period of one year assuming that the birds do not take any avoidance measure) for these species were estimated. We also identified species at risk from collision with transformers and wind-masts, and at risk from electrocution. Reduction in avian activity in the study area was evident with progress of wind farm erection. Despite the small footprint of an individual wind turbine, the associated infrastructure development causes wider habitat modification and destruction resulting in a displacement effect. Therefore, wind farm erections in strategic locations such as biodiversity hotspots should be subject to prior site based strategic environmental assessments (SEA) as well as environmental impact assessment (EIA) studies.",,,,,,,,,8,0,0,0,12,0,14,,,0974-7893,0974-7907,,,,,,,,,,"Ela Fdn, C-9,Bhosale Pk,Sahakarnagar 2, Pune 411009, Maharashtra, India",,,,2013-03-29,BCI:BCI201300269368,,

Thus the effect of pore pressure and load frequency are illustrated by implementing a poroelastic model to present more realistic dynamic properties and compare them with results obtained by the p-y curve method. A cyclic loading is considered and the soil stiffness based on the Winkler and Kelvin models is calculated and compared while the soil damping for the Kelvin model is computed.

Mono-Bucket can be a breakthrough in the sphere of offshore wind turbines foundations due to its lightness and fast installation and consequently cost-effectiveness compared to other common solutions.The long-term cyclic loading can cause degradation of soil-bucket system stiffness, which yields into accumulated and permanent deformations. Despite of the advantages, there is no standard procedure to design the foundation especially for assessing the accumulated deformations under environmental long-term loading. However, numerical and semi-empirical methods already used for offshore foundations can be adopted to take into account the effect of cyclic loading on Mono-Buckets. Among them, load-displacement techniques as cyclic p-y curves are of interest for its simplicity, however, they cannot normally consider the load frequency as well as soil real response due to pore-pressure development. On the other hand, numerical analyses including sophisticated constitutive soil models which account for the more realistic response are available. The numerical analysis are able to simulate the soil behavior to the cyclic loading with more details, although they are typically time consuming and sometimes not applicable for the design purposes. Therefore using a fast and quite accurate method with eliminating the complexity of detailed numerical calculation is highly demanded at the different design phases.The intention of the current study is to present, review and summarize the existing techniques to assess the effect of cyclic loading on Mono-Bucket foundations while emphasizing the advantage and disadvantage of each of them.

In this paper, the number of collision victims at Belgian offshore wind farms was estimated with a (theoretical) collision risk model based on technical turbine specifications, bird-related parameters and bird density data of both local seabirds and passerine migrants. Bird density data were gathered by visual censuses and radar registrations. The outcome of the model was extrapolated to future development scenarios in the Belgian part of the North Sea and in the entire North Sea, and then further used for a preliminary assessment of the impact at population level for the species at risk. The results indicate that the cumulative impact of a realistic scenario of 10,000 turbines in the North Sea might have a significant negative effect at population level for lesser and great black-backed gull. We further show that during a single night of intense songbird migration, the number of collision victims among passerine migrants might be in the order of magnitude of several thousands in the entire North Sea.

The objective of the present study is to investigate the formation of horseshoe vortex and flow structures around two different bottom-fixed offshore wind turbine foundations in order to provide an assessment of potential scour for engineering design. Three-dimensional CFD simulations have been performed using Spalart-Allmaras delayed detached eddy simulation (SADDES) at a Reynolds number 4 x 10(6) based on the freestream velocity and the diameter of the monopile foundation, D. A seabed boundary layer flow with a boundary layer thickness D is assumed for all the simulations. Vortical structures, time-averaged results of velocity distributions and bed shear stresses are computed. The numerical results are discussed by studying the difference in flows around the monopile and the gravity-based foundations. A distinct horseshoe vortex is found in front of the monopile foundation. Two small horseshoe vortices are found in front of the hexagonal gravity-based foundation, i.e., one is on the top of the bottom slab and one is near the seabed in front of the bottom slab. The horseshoe vortex size for the hexagonal gravity-based foundation is found to be smaller than that for the monopile foundation.

Recently, following inspections the performance of GCs has been called into doubt when settlements were reported on several monopiles. To further comprehend the structural performance of GCs under large bending moments a nonlinear Finite Element (FE) analysis was conducted. Three-dimensional FE models were solved and validated against experimental and analytical data with good agreement. It is suggested that the presented models can be used to evaluate the global and local behaviour of a GC accurately. Finally, a comprehensive parametric study was carried out to investigate the influence of shear key numbers, shear key spacing and overlap lengths. It was shown that increased number of shear keys are advantageous for stiffness and reduce the gap at the interfaces, whereas the grout failure depends on the spacing between neighbouring shear keys.

Catenary mooring-line is increasingly used due to its lower cost and easier installation. Its dynamics coming from structure and fluid flow becomes more obvious with the increase of structural length, which may introduce significant impact on restoring performance of mooring-line. In this study, the non-linearly restoring performance and the hysteresis behavior of mooring-line's stiffness are studied. The nonlinear dynamic model of the mooring-line is established based on the improved FEM simulations. It is found that the restoring stiffness of the catenary mooring-line presents a hysteresis characteristic, principally owing to the damping effect of the catenary dynamics, which gets more obvious with the increase of motion amplitude/frequency. And, the mooring-line dynamics has significant impacts on the tension (related to its restoring stiffness) and displacement response, e.g. the maximum tension amplitude is up to 5.2 times of the quasi-static value if slack happens.",,,,,,,,,7,2,0,0,0,0,9,,,0029-8018,,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Paris Saclay, Lab MSSMat, Cent Supelec, F-91190 Gif Sur Yvette, FranceChinese Acad Sci, Inst Mech, Key Lab Mech Fluid Solid Coupling Syst, Beijing 100190, Peoples R ChinaAVIC Composite Technol Ctr, AVIC Mfg Technol Inst, Beijing 101300, Peoples R ChinaUniv Chinese Acad Sci, Sch Engn Sci, Beijing 100049, Peoples R ChinaBeijing Univ Aeronaut & Astronaut, Sino French Engn Sch, Beijing 100191, Peoples R China",,,,2020-07-07,WOS:000542188700005,,

A novel methodology is presented to incorporate uncertainties, e.g., on the expected maintenance duration, into the decision-making process. Users specify the extent to which these unknown elements impact the suggested vessel routing strategy. If uncertainties are present, the tool outputs multiple vessel routing policies with varying likelihoods of success. To demonstrate the tool's capabilities, two case studies were presented. Firstly, simulations based on synthetic data illustrate that in a scenario with uncertainties, the cost-optimal solution is not necessarily the best choice for operators. Including uncertainties when calculating the vessel routing policy led to a 14% increase in the number of wind turbines maintained at the end of the day. Secondly, the tool was applied to a real-life scenario based on an offshore wind farm in collaboration with a United Kingdom (UK) operator. The results showed that the assignment of vessels to turbines generated by the tool matched the policy chosen by wind farm operators.

The Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) atmospheric model, along with the NCEP/NCAR R2 reanalysis climatic database, are applied to create wind resource maps at 80 m, 100 m, and 120 m above mean sea level (amsl) in order to identify the potential surface areas for the development of offshore wind power plants. The predicted wind speeds are validated using observed wind speeds obtained from 13 met masts installed along the coastline of the GoT. Results show that the average annual mean wind speeds reach the range of 5.5-6.5 m/s in specific areas of the Bay of Bangkok, situated in the northern part of the GoT. Based on the results of the wind resource assessment and using computational fluid dynamics microscale wind flow modelings, a wind power plant optimization is performed. The technical power potential and a priority zoning for offshore wind power development is performed using wind turbine generators of 3.3-8.0 MW capacity. Depending on the wind turbine generator selected, it is found that 642-924 MW of capacity could be installed in the short-term planning; 2658 to 3825 MW of additional capacity could be added in the medium-term planning, and 2864 to 4120 MW of additional capacity in the long-term planning. These wind power plants would have an annual energy production in the order of 5.68 PWh in the short-term, an additional 23 to 33 PWh in the medium-term, and an additional 25 to 36 PWh in the long-term, thus avoiding CO2eq emissions in the order of 3-4.5 million tons CO2eq per year in the short-term, 13 to 18 million tons in the medium-term, and 14 to 20 million tons in the long-term. In total, depending on the wind turbine generator selected, wind power plants in the GoT could have a total installed capacity of 6000 to over 8000 MW, would generate between 50 and 75 PWh of energy per year, while avoiding emissions of 30-40 million tons CO2eq per year.

The cost advantage is linked to more shallow water and shorter connection to shore even avoiding an offshore substation. Public tendering for offshore wind in Denmark has opened up for near-shore wind turbine farms as an alternative for lowering the cost of new offshore wind development. Whether these proposed near-shore locations will manage to significantly lower costs is not clear. The tenders have resulted in bids that are at comparable levels for the nearshore and the further offshore wind farms. We compare the cost drivers and possible cost differentials with preferences for locating wind farms further away from the coast. The primary cost driver is water depth and in the Danish case water depth is increasing slowly or is not even correlated with the distance from shore. Therefore the willingness to pay for moving turbines away from the coast may be sufficiently high to balance the increased cost The actual comparison of costs and willingness to pay must be carried out for the specific case with cost characteristics and willingness to pay by the affected population.

The birds feed in the open water at varying distances from the coast and roost either in the lee of dikes or in sheltered waters bordering the lakes Ijsselmeer and Markermeer. Most species feed during the day and roost at night. Tufted Ducks Aythya fuligula, Pochards A. ferina and most Scaups A. marila, however, show a reverse rhythm. The Ijsselmeer area has been designated as a potential site for wind farms. If wind turbines are placed between the feeding and roosting areas of diving ducks, birds flying at turbine height may run the risk of colliding with the turbines, particularly during darkness. The altitude at which diving ducks fly between feeding and roosting areas is unknown. We studied the nocturnal flight patterns and altitudes of birds crossing dikes and open water between the roosting and feeding areas at six localities in the Usselmeer area during February and March 1995 (Fig. 1, Tab. 1). Flight altitudes were measured from the end of the day until early the next morning using a reconstructed FR 8250 Furuno ship radar. At Andijk, Pampushaven and Lelystad-Haven observations were made close to the roosting areas. At Urkerhoek the birds were about 6 km from the roosting place when they passed the radar. At Oude Zeug and Dijkmagazijn we were able to measure flight altitudes at both short and long distances from the roosting site. At Oude Zeug and Andijk Scaups predominated at the other sites Tufted Ducks were superior in numbers (Tab. 1). At Andijk we also observed Goldeneyes Bucephala clangula and sawbills Mergus spp. Most flights of sawbills and Goldeneyes occurred before sunset and after sunrise. Scaups flew mainly during daylight and twilight (first 45 minutes after sunset and last 45 minutes before sunrise), while Tufted Ducks and Pochards predominantly flew during darkness (figure 2). As a result the majority of nocturnal movements of diving ducks took place during the first one and a half hours after sunset and the last one and a half hours before sunrise. At some localities, we also saw flight movements in the hours in between. In general, it was unknown which species were involved in these nocturnal flights. At Lelystad-Haven, some of the bird echoes originated from roaming gulls. Elsewhere, however, the echoes may have originated from diving ducks wandering at the feeding grounds. Birds predominately passed at altitudes below 75 m (figures 3-6). The few bird echoes at altitudes above I 00 m probably originated from migrating geese. When Tufted Ducks and Pochards crossed dikes, they flew at altitudes of up to 75 m, when flying above open water they reached altitudes of up to 50 m. At Urkerhoek, where the ducks were faced with strong head-winds, birds passed at altitudes below 30 m.",,,,,,,,,4,0,0,0,4,0,5,,,0024-3620,,,,,,,,,,,"Bureau Waardenburg bv, Postbus 365, 4100 AJ Culemborg, Netherlands",,,,1998-07-01,BCI:BCI199800472354,,

Offshore wind power generating facilities are becoming more common in the marine environment and alter the characteristics of the fisheries in the surrounding area. Floating wind turbines can act as fish aggregating devices (FAD), thereby increasing the catchability for some species. Many marine recreational fisheries are open access without effort restrictions; therefore, control of total harvest is difficult. Creating a limited entry recreational fishery and excluding commercial fishing from the area surrounding offshore wind turbines may aid in controlling total harvest and may benefit several important stakeholder groups: (1) recreational and commercial fishermen in terms of higher recreational catch rates and potentially higher overall yield, (2) fisheries managers in terms of more precise control of recreational fisheries harvest, and (3) owners of offshore wind power facilities in terms of reduced risk of damage to infrastructure due to fishing activity. We discuss the compatibility of wind power facilities and fisheries, conditions conducive to this compatibility, and provide an example from a proposed offshore wind power facility in the Adriatic Sea and its potential to affect the fisheries management there, particularly for bluefin tuna (Thunnus thynuus).

Due to the destructive energy in the typhoon, the conventional active control method for load mitigations of the blades such as the yaw and pitch systems are difficult to implement effectively. Therefore, the adaptive blade that can mitigate the extreme load passively may be a more promising method. In this paper, the adaptive bend-twist coupling blades were investigated on their load mitigation effects. According to a parameterized modeling process, the high fidelity CFD and FEM models for different kinds of bend-twist coupling blades are established. Then the FSI simulations are used to study the mitigating effects of these blades when the blade suffers the extremely dangerous conditions in typhoon environment. The results demonstrate that the swept blade combined with the material coupling can effectively reduce the aerodynamic load and the maximum stress due to the special pattern of the blade deformation. For the case which is easy to cause a high frequent vortex vibration, the swept blades also show a good performance to decrease the dominant frequency and amplitude of the load fluctuation, which is helpful to avoid damages caused by the resonance vibration.

Fatigue assessment includes estimation of the remaining lifetime and accumulated fatigue damage. In order to do so, the complete distribution of stresses along the structure with main emphasis at the fatigue hot-spots is to be known. Stress time histories are directly linked to the corresponding strains which can normally be measured using conventional or optical strain gauges. For the case of OWTs on monopile foundations, though, most of the fatigue hot-spots are located beneath the water level, thus making it impossible to install strain sensors at these locations for existing turbines. This measurement restriction motivates the use of virtual sensing technique to estimate strains at fatigue critical and inaccessible locations and subsequently accurately assess their fatigue.

In this study we present a numerical model that includes both inviscid slow-drift forcing through full quadratic transfer functions (QTFs) and viscous forcing. To accommodate a linear damping matrix that represents all the damping effects on the floater, the classical Morison formulation of the drag forcing with relative velocity is simplified into a pure forcing term and a linear constant damping term. The frequency-dependent radiation properties are also replaced by constant matrices. We investigate the application of Operational Modal Analysis (OMA) to estimate the damping ratios from the test data, and also pursue a calibration method where the linear damping is calibrated in the modal space and subsequently transformed back to the physical space. The model is compared to wave basin data for four environmental conditions including the 50-year sea state. The damping ratios estimated with OMA generally increase with the sea state. The measured response can be generally well reproduced by the model when the damping is calibrated for each sea state. Due to the neglection of first-order motion effects in the applied QTFs and to the damping introduced by the mooring lines, however, the surge response is underpredicted for the severe sea states, and the yaw motion is always underpredicted. The commonly used approach where the damping is calibrated to the decay tests is found to provide less accurate results than the approach of calibrating the modal damping ratios for the given sea state. The damping ratios estimated with OMA are found similar to the calibrated values for mild pink-noise sea states, while significant differences exist for the stronger Pierson-Moskowitz sea states. Thus the potential and limitations for OMA application in different sea states is discussed. In summary, the model is found able to generally predict the measured response, provided that the damping is properly calibrated for each sea state.",,,,,,,,,19,0,0,0,0,0,19,,,0951-8339,1873-4170,,,,,,,,,,"Tech Univ Denmark, Dept Wind Energy, Nils Koppels Alle,Bldg 403, DK-2800 Lyngby, Denmark",,,,2019-06-26,WOS:000471362100013,,

Such turbine states are preferred in order to mitigate loads on the turbine blades; simultaneously, yaw control is required so as to track the changing wind direction in this configuration. During a hurricane, however, it is possible that a turbine's yaw control system might operate abnormally due to damage of the control and protection system or due to loss of the electric grid and/or insufficient backup power. In earlier studies, the authors have shown that feathered blades can lead to higher tower bending moments in the side-to-side (lateral) direction rather than in the fore-aft (longitudinal) direction. In the present study, we carry out an in-depth investigation of the effect of several alternative parked configurations on an offshore turbine's response using numerical simulations with coupled wind-wave fields during a hurricane. We use these output wind-wave fields obtained from the University of Miami Coupled Model (UMCM), a fully coupled atmosphere-wave-ocean model that is used to simulate the storm and associated environmental fields and is able to represent relevant physical processes at the air-sea interface. In this study, we evaluate: (1) the effect of different nacelle yaw angles relative to the wind direction (i. e., different amounts of yaw error or misalignment); (2) the effect of different blade pitch angles; (3) the effect of different turbine parking strategies-e.g., parked and at a standstill or in an idling state; and (4) load maxima at different blade azimuthal configurations while the turbine is in a standstill state. The effects of the different turbine parked configurations on turbine response are evaluated under only wind loads first; later, wave loads are included to reflect possible joint metocean conditions likely to be encountered during a hurricane.",,,,,,,,,14,0,0,0,0,0,17,,,0309-524X,2048-402X,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Texas Austin, Dept Civil Architectural & Environm Engn, Austin, TX 78712 USA",,,,2014-08-01,WOS:000210813500006,,

The number of blades is one of the main concerns when designing a VAWT for offshore application. In this paper, the effect of blade number on the performance of VAWTs and dynamic behavior of floating VAWTs was comprehensively studied in a fully coupled aero-hydro-servo-elastic way. Three VAWTs with straight and parallel blades, with identical solidity and with a blade number varying from two to four, were designed using the actuator cylinder method and adapted to a semi-submersible platform. A generator torque controller was also designed based on a PI control algorithm. Time domain simulations demonstrated that the aerodynamic loads and structural responses are strongly dependent on the number of blades. In particular, by increasing the number of blades from two to three reduces the variation in the tower base bending moment more significantly than increasing it from three to four. However, the blade number does not significantly affect the generator power production due to the control strategy employed, and the platform motions and tension in mooring lines because of the compliant catenary mooring system.

Firstly, a positive-sequence-voltage-dependent (PSVD) active current reduction control loop is introduced to the offshore wind turbines. The method enhances the performance of the offshore AC voltage drop FRT compliance strategy. Secondly, an adaptive current limiting control strategy which operates simultaneously on the positive and the negative sequence current is discussed. It enables negative sequence current injection, while at the same time respecting the maximum fault current capacity of the HVDC converter station. Finally, a state machine is proposed for the VSC-HVDC system and for the offshore wind turbines respectively. It coordinates the fault and the post-fault response during balanced as well as unbalanced faults, ensuring a smooth shift from the normal operating point towards the fault and the post-fault period.

We suggest an innovative concept that is a two-step strategy which consists first in strengthening the bond joints with carbon-nanotubes (CNTs), that be followed by a stitching of the two bonded joints with a composite cord. It is worthwhile to note that CNT can either reinforce the two halves of wind-blades and/or be added in between the pre-pregs composite plies before curing, to enhance bonding stiffness. A Finite Element model is proposed where simulation takes into account parameters such as CNT-weight fraction, chirality and CNTs inclination versus mechanical loading.

In order to assess the economic viability of an investment in SWT, we analyze a set of scenarios that incorporate different types of SWT, various storage system options, support schemes, and specific urban surroundings for the case of Germany. As urban structures substantially influence local wind speeds, and hence the potential energy yield of a turbine, the location of SWT in the urban area is crucial for their economic feasibility. We find that SWT today are only profitable under very favorable conditions, the most important parameters being prevailing wind speeds and the location's degree of urbanization. In most cases, the coupling of the SWT to a storage system is crucial for cost-effectiveness. A feed-in tariff system specifically adapted to SWT technology is found to be an important driver of diffusion. Further research needs are identified in the field of long-term performance and yield projections for SWT.

Here the tide is 'only' some 1.3 metres/secroot mean cube velocity (rmcv) and is considered uneconomic by MCT, the longestestablishedtidalstream developer.However, Corran is a very sheltered site that borders the A82 and a major power line isalready in place, so, without affecting the leisure boat traffic, an initial investment of only£5m would produce annual profits of some £11.5m.

A general damage analysis framework is proposed by the certification bodies. Therein the total lifetime of the structure is considered as a series of elementary situations combining structural and environmental states. For a given structural state, the loading environment is described using statistical parameters such as the wind mean speed at hub height or the peak spectral period of the sea. An estimation of the structural response is to be computed for each of the environmental combinations of parameters, therefore leading to tens of thousands simulations. The cost of a single simulation makes this process often unfeasible for engineers who are usually forced to reduce the number of simulations considering industrial feedback with risks of potential lack of representativity of results. This paper aims at presenting a novel method for the reduction of the simulation costs relative to the long-term damage estimation (relative to a design load case) and based on the so-called adaptive Kriging approach. From on a reduced set of observations (multiphysics simulator runs), a Kriging metamodel is here used to approximate the damage model response for all the nonsimulated sets of environmental parameters. The latter are subsequently used to assess the long-term damage as presented in the standards. The statistical measure of the metamodel error of prediction is used into an iterative structure in order to progressively enrich the design of experiments with informative sets of environmental parameters. This allows us minimizing the global uncertainty of the approximation. The proposed algorithm, hereafter called the AK-DA for Adaptive Kriging Damage Assessment, is illustrated with two industrial cases of fatigue analyses for the NREL 5MW reference monopile structure and its direct application",,,,,,,,,13,1,0,0,0,0,13,,,1095-4244,1099-1824,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Clermont Auvergne, Inst Pascal, CNRS, SIGMA Clermont, F-63000 Clermont Ferrand, FranceEDF R&D, Dept ERMES, 7 Blvd Gaspard Monge, F-91120 Palaiseau, France",,,,2019-06-04,WOS:000468030500003,,

International scholarship holds that place attachment serves as a reason for opposition to wind farm projects. Although most of the WCR residents had strong place attachments to their region, most of the respondents also supported the proposed wind farm projects. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

It was not until the 20th century that technological developments in other fields revolutionized wind power conversion and ultimately led to modern wind turbine systems. This re-emergence of wind as a significant energy source is now encouraged by the need to meet increasing worldwide electricity demand and reduce the environmental impact caused by the conventional electricity generation technologies.Considerable progress in wind-power technology during the last decades has pushed it as an important supplier of grid-connected electricity in the worldwide energy picture. Today, wind turbines on the market show a variety of innovative concepts combined with proven technology for both generators and power electronics. But, there are still several technological challenges in wind power. Some are related to the development of utility-scale turbines of cheaper construction, transport and deployment, that may further reduce generation cost at both inland and offshore locations. Some others are related to finding practical and economical ways of harvesting wind energy at the small-scale level for isolated consumers or for distributed generation systems. The objective of this paper is to explore innovative concepts proposed in wind power that may help address these challenges by going beyond the classical evolutive-design process.

While most renewable resources are free, the technology used to usefully convert such resources is not and there is an increasing focus on improving the conversion economy and efficiency. To this end, advanced control technology can have a significant impact and is already a relatively mature technology for wind turbines. Though wave energy systems are still in their infancy, significant benefits have been shown to accrue from the appropriate use of control technology. To date, the application communities connected with wind and wave energy have had little communication, resulting in little cross fertilisation of control ideas and experience, particularly from the more mature wind area to wave. This paper examines the application of control technology across both domains, both from a comparative and contrasting point of view, with the aim of identifying commonalities in control objectives and potential solutions. Key comparative reference points include the articulation of the stochastic resource models, specification of control objectives, development of realistic device models, and development of solution concepts. Not least, in terms of realistic system requirements are the set of physical and legislative constraints under which such renewable energy systems must operate, and the need to provide reliable and fault-tolerant control solutions, which respect the often remote and relatively inaccessible location of many offshore deployments.

Wind energy resources are one of the most promising avenues for renewable energy generation, and the field has experienced significant technological innovation and growth over the past few years. This paper reviews various issues related to wind-power generation resources. Current trends, over the last two decades, of increasing wind turbine sizes, rated power-generation capacity, efficiencies, and the actual size of wind farm facilities are projected to continue. It is theorized that the current global installed capacity of wind power generation may increase from the current generation of 540 (2017) to 5800 GW by 2050. Wind energy potential, in terms of vertical wind speed profile, mean wind-speed distribution, turbulence effects and gust, are discussed in detail in this paper. A decreasing trend in the cost of initial capital investment and the levelized cost of energy (LCOE), for both onshore and offshore wind-power generation developments, are projected to continue, although this is regionally and economy-size dependent. Key challenges have been identified for the development of wind power generation in developed and under-developed countries going forward. New approaches/developments in the field and avenues for further research or actions that can be undertaken are also outlined in this paper. Materialization of such lines of actionsmay lead to an increase in global wind energy from its current level of around 4% of the electricity generation mix to roughly 40%.",,,,,,,,,29,2,0,0,3,0,31,,,1543-5075,1543-5083,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Dublin, Dept Civil Struct & Environm Engn, Dublin, IrelandUniv Engn & Technol, Dept Geol Engn, Lahore, Pakistan",Univ Dublin,,,2019-05-17,WOS:000466666400001,,

However, since 2010, a step change in comprehensiveness has been employed, for example, conducting the LCA to individually assess all components within a wind turbine (being composed of around 25,000 parts).Three LCAs have been conducted with the 2-MW GridStreamer(TM) turbines in accordance with ISO 14040/44 and critically reviewed by an expert. The goal was to evaluate potential environmental impacts and other non-impact indicators per kilowatt hour of electricity generated for a 'typical' 50-MW onshore wind plant.The LCAs assessed all life cycle stages and were built using GaBi DfX software. A significant quantity of primary data were gathered, for example, covering over 100 Vestas' sites for manufacturing, sales and servicing, as well as establishing turbine use-phase performance (i.e. electricity generation, servicing, etc.) based on over 20,000 monitored wind turbines around the world, covering around 20 % of the current worldwide installed capacity.The baseline results show that per kilowatt hour of electricity generated by the 2-MW GridStreamer (TM) turbines have the following baseline performance: ADP elements 0.44 to 0.58 mg Sb-e, ADP fossil 0.10 to 0.13 MJ; acidification potential 37 to 45 mg SO2-e, eutrophication potential 3.7 to 4.5 mg PO4-e, freshwater aquatic ecotoxicity 100 to 130 mg DCB-e, global warming potential 7 to 10 g CO2-e, human toxicity potential 1,150 to 1,400 mg DCB-e, marine aquatic ecotoxicity potential 1,100 to 1,300 g DCB-e, photochemical oxidant creation 4 to 5 mg ethene, terrestrial ecotoxicity potential 19 to 24 mg DCB-e, return-on energy 8 to 11 months and recyclability 81 to 85 % of turbine mass.Being equipped with extensive facts and comprehensive LCA models provides Vestas the basis to further integrate environmental considerations into product marketing, design and research, procurement and to deliver transparent information to stakeholders.Overall, the article presents a case study of the LCA approach used to assess the potential impacts of 2-MW GridStreamer (TM) turbines based upon comprehensive product knowledge and represents a state-of-the-art approach to LCA modelling of wind power.

Due to the increased sensitivity of the considered system with respect to the environmental conditions from wind and ocean, the application of common procedures used for fixed-bottom structures results in either inaccurate simulation results or hard-to-quantify conservatism in the system design. Monte Carlo-based sampling procedures provide a more realistic approach to deal with the large variation in the environmental conditions, although basic randomization has shown slow convergence. Specialized sampling methods allow efficient coverage of the complete design space, resulting in faster convergence and hence a reduced number of required simulations. In this study, a quasi-random sampling approach based on Sobol sequences is applied to select representative events for the determination of the lifetime damage. This is calculated applying Monte Carlo integration, using subsets of a resulting total of 16 200 coupled time-domain simulations performed with the simulation code FAST. The considered system is the Danmarks Tekniske Universitet (DTU) 10 MW reference turbine installed on the LIFES50 + OO-Star Wind Floater Semi 10 MW floating platform. Statistical properties of the considered environmental parameters (i.e., wind speed, wave height and wave period) are determined based on the measurement data from the Gulf of Maine, USA. Convergence analyses show that it is sufficient to perform around 200 simulations in order to reach less than 10% uncertainty of lifetime fatigue damage-equivalent loading. Complementary in-depth investigation is performed, focusing on the load sensitivity and the impact of outliers (i.e., values far away from the mean).

These substrates are densely colonized by fouling organisms, which may compete for the available resources. While the distribution of some species is restricted to specific parts of the turbine, others occur across depth zones and may therefore face different competitive environments. Here we investigate the trophic niches of seven invertebrate species: three sessile (Diadumene cincta, Metridium senile, and Mytilus edulis), one hemi-sessile (Jassa herdmani) and three mobile species (Ophiothrix fragilis, Necora puber, and Pisidia longicomis) that occur in multiple depth zones. We hypothesized that these species would be trophic generalists, exhibiting trophic plasticity by selecting different resources in different depth zones, to cope with the different competitive environments in which they occur. We analyzed delta C-13 and delta N-15 of these species and their potential resources across depth zones. Our results show that most of these invertebrates are indeed trophic generalists which display substantial trophic plasticity, selecting different resources in different zones. Degree of trophic plasticity was not related to mobility of the species. There are two possible explanations for these dietary changes with depth: either consumers switch diet to avoid competition with other (dominant) species, or they benefit from the consumption of a non-limiting resource. Only Diadumene cincta was a trophic specialist that consumed suspended particulate organic matter (SPOM) independent of its zone of occurrence. Altogether, trophic plasticity appears an important mechanism for the co-existence of invertebrate species along the depth gradient of an offshore wind turbine.",,,,,,,,,18,0,0,0,12,0,19,,,,2296-7745,,,,,,,,,,"Royal Belgian Inst Nat Sci, Operat Directorate Nat Environm Marine Ecol & Man, Brussels, BelgiumUniv Ghent, Dept Biol, Marine Biol Res Grp, Ghent, Belgium",,,,2020-06-16,WOS:000537628000001,,

It is advantageous for offshore installation to be integrated into a single operation. The large-scale composite bucket foundation is the basis for a one-step integrated transportation and installation technique using a specialized transport vessel. The proposed transportation and installation technique will minimize the offshore operation and maximize the proportion of work carried out onshore with consequent benefits in terms of cost, quality, and safety. The self-floating composite bucket foundation is towed into the semicircle groove of the vessel and connected to the wire ropes of a stationary crane. Then the tower and turbine are attached to the foundation at the shore and the entire unit consisting of the foundation, tower, and turbine is loaded out from the quayside, transported to the site and set down on the seabed. During transport, half of the unit's weight is taken by the hoisting system of the vessel, and the remaining half of the weight is supported by air cushions inside the composite bucket foundation. A detailed model is studied to determine the motions of the vessel with two units to confirm the viability and feasibility of such a method of integrated transportation. The draft and air cushion are two effect parameters used to determine the dynamical characteristics of the transportation structure system. The results show that a smaller draft and a greater air cushion positively contribute to a safe transportation process. The viability and feasibility of this method of integrated transportation are confirmed by determining the motions of the various elements proposed by the detailed model.

In this paper prediction of fatigue reliability of welded multi-planar tubular joints of the support structure of a fixed jacket offshore wind turbine designed for a northern North Sea site in a water depth of 70 m is performed. Dynamic response of the jacket support structure due to wind and wave loads is calculated by using a decoupled procedure with good accuracy. Hot-spot stresses at failure-critical location of the relative reference brace of the selected tubular joint are derived by summation of the single stress components from axial, in-plane and out-of-plane action, the effects of planar and non-planar braces are also considered. A two-parameter Weibull function is used to fit the long-term statistical distribution of hot-spot stress ranges by combination of time domain simulation for representative environmental conditions (wind/sea states) in operational condition. The main uncertainties associated with the whole procedure of reliability analysis are identified and quantified. The load histories are normalized to ensure that fatigue design criteria based on the SN-Miner-Palmgren approach is satisfied. Hence the reliability estimates obtained refer to fatigue design of tubular joints that satisfy design criteria. The reliability analysis is based on fracture mechanics (FM) analysis of crack growth. The corrosion-induced increased crack growth rate is taken into account by considering the increased hot-spot stress range due to changes of nominal stress and stress concentration factors (SCFs) produced by the thickness thinning (wastage) effects of all braces and chord of the selected tubular joint with a general uniform corrosion model. The geometry function effect and the material degradation effect due to corrosion on the reliability analysis are also investigated. The effects of inspection and repair with and without consideration of corrosion are quantified based on the quality of inspection in terms of probability of crack detection curves. The sensitivity of the reliability index on important random variables is estimated. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

However, currently proposed droop-controlled HVDC networks that cover a wide geographical area require communication between converters to update the droop coefficients. The reliance on the communication becomes a limiting factor in the development of MTDC networks. In this paper, we present a novel communication-less and cooperative dc voltage control technique for a multi-terminal HVDC transmission system that employs an H-infinity controller for the voltage regulation. One grid side converter, called the master, and an offshore wind farm are designated to guarantee the main dc voltage stability as well as to maintain a power reserve for the provision of fast grid support services. A flexible main dc voltage level is maintained by the master converter to control the power output and to indirectly signal to the wind farm to inject more or less power, hence no dedicated communication system is needed. An H-infinity local dc voltage controller is designed to manage efficiently the reserve of power in the form of de-loaded wind turbines. The proposed controller acts on the blade pitch angle and guarantees the internal stability of the presented multi-terminal HVDC (MTDC) transmission system locally around an equilibrium (operating) point. The studied MTDC consists of three converter terminals, a master converter, a standard active/reactive power converter and an offshore wind farm.

According to American Wind Energy Association reports, between 2007 and 2010, wind power provided more than 35% of all new U.S. electric capacity. Despite the rapid growth in wind energy, there are still significant wind energy resources that are underutilized. The U.S. Department of Energy estimates that offshore wind alone could offer over 4,000 GW of electrical energy which is four times the nation's current total generation capacity. In order to harness this renewable resource significant logistic challenges must be overcome to keep these systems working in harsh offshore environments. The deployment of a structural health monitoring (SHM) systems will be important for these off-shore wind power plants, which are gaining an increasing interest by investors. Wind turbines come in a number of typologies (e.g. horizontal-axis wind turbine and vertical-axis) and are selected according to the specific environment in which they are designed to operate. Furthermore, wind turbines are complex cyber-physical systems consisting of blades, generators, hydraulics and electronics/computation each of which features different failure mechanisms with unique impact in term of down-time and repair cost. All these systems must be continuously monitored in order to ensure they are operating to their maximum potential. Unfortunately continuous monitoring using conventional analog-to-digital converters will result in a large amount of data that will need to be stored and processed. In this work we study the suitability of compressed sensing (CS) for long-term acoustic emission (AE)-based SHM of wind turbine blades. In particular the current work simulates the CS acquisition process as applied to AE data acquired during experimental fatigue-to-failure tests (see Figure 1) performed on a full-scale blade of a horizontal axis wind turbine (HAWT). AE represents a promising technique to develop a monitoring strategy for detecting and possibly localizing the presence of damage (i.e. delamination) in mechanical components. When damage occurs or propagates in a structure an acoustic wave is generated by the rapid release in the internal stress of a material. These AE events can be captured at a relative large distances from the wave's point of origin which facilitates damage monitoring. AE events are transient in nature, occur at short time scales, and exhibit high-frequency content. Capturing signals with these characteristics using conventional sensing techniques requires maintaining a high sampling frequency over an extended period of time. The result is that a large amount of data is generated that must be analyzed, stored, and possible transmitted to decision makers. CS offers an opportunity to make these measurements in a manner that will significantly reduce the sampling rates and amount of data that needs to be stored/analyzed for these applications. In prior work it was discovered that acoustic emission events in aluminum could be sparsely represented using the appropriate dictionaries of signals, thus making AE signals good candidates for compressed sensing techniques. The importance of this work consists in finding techniques to detect AE emission events in compressed measurements, a sparse representation of AE events, using over-complete dictionaries of signals and determining whether or not compressed measurements are worth further consideration for AE-based structural health monitoring.",,,,,9th International Workshop on Structural Health Monitoring (IWSHM)9th International Workshop on Structural Health Monitoring (IWSHM),"SEP 10-12, 2013SEP 10-12, 2013",AF Off Sci Res; Army Res Lab; Off Naval Res; Boeing; Airbus; EmbraerAF Off Sci Res; Army Res Lab; Off Naval Res; Boeing; Airbus; Embraer,"Stanford Univ, Stanford, CAStanford Univ, Stanford, CA",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,978-1-60595-115-7,,,,,,,,,,,,,2014-02-05,WOS:000329292700094,,

Renewable energy systems, based on photovoltaics and wind turbines, present a more sustainable and potentially cost-effective option for remote communities with abundant sun and wind. Designing and implementing community-owned and operated renewable power generation alternatives for critical infrastructure such as hospitals, water sanitation, and schools is one approach towards community autonomy and resiliency. However, configuring a cost-effective and reliable renewable power system is challenging due to the many design choices to be made, the large variations in the renewable power sources, and the location specific renewable power source availability. This paper presents an optimization-based approach to aid the configuration of a solar photovoltaic (PV), wind turbine generator and lead-acid battery storage hybrid power system. The approach, implemented in MATLAB, Uses a detailed time series system model to analyze system Loss of Load Probability (LOLP) and a lifetime system cost model to analyze system cost. These models are coupled to a genetic algorithm to perform a multi-objective optimization of system reliability and cost.The method was applied to two case studies to demonstrate the approach: a windy location (Gibraltar, UK), and a predominantly sunny location (Riyadh, Saudi Arabia). Hourly solar and wind resource data was extracted for these locations from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration for five-year data sets. The village load requirements were statistically generated from a mean daily load for the community estimated based on the population and basic electricity needs. The case studies demonstrate that the mix and size of technologies is dependent on local climatic conditions. In addition, the results show the tradeoff between system reliability and cost, allowing designers to make important decisions for the remote communities.",,,,,ASME International Design Engineering Technical Conferences and Computers and Information in Engineering ConferenceASME International Design Engineering Technical Conferences and Computers and Information in Engineering Conference,"AUG 02-05, 2015AUG 02-05, 2015","ASME, Design Engn Div; ASME, Comp & Informat Engn DivASME, Design Engn Div; ASME, Comp & Informat Engn Div","Boston, MABoston, MA",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,978-0-7918-5707-6,,,,,,,,,"Univ Toronto, Mech Engn, Water & Energy Res Lab, Toronto, ON, Canada",,,,2016-09-08,WOS:000379883700030,,

Monopiles are a popular foundation solution for supporting offshore wind turbines. However, due to challenging seabed soil conditions, which often feature thick normally consolidated soft clays and harsh environmental loading (i.e. frequent occurrence of typhoons), extremely long monopiles are often designed. The large monopiles are costly to fabricate and install and sometimes kills the viability of the concept in cases where the bedrock is relatively shallow and expensive piling in rock is otherwise required. However, the state-of-practice for designing these monopiles in clays is typically by using the API p-y springs, which are widely known to underestimate soil-pile interaction stiffness and capacity for large diameter monopiles. Improvement to the design method can therefore have significant economic implications to the industry. The paper presents an effort toward this direction. A multi-spring beam-column model suitable for monopile design in soil conditions in China is proposed. The model features three soil spring components, namely the lateral p-y spring, the pile tip base shear s-y spring and rotational m-theta springs along the pile shaft. The validity of the model is verified by a comprehensive suite finite element parametric analyses. Guidance for incorporating the cyclic loading effect into design is also provided.

The wind speed variations over the hours of the day were quite small. The monthly variation in the average wind speeds was between 4.3 (May) and 7.5 m s(-1) (December) for the BZK site and 4.4 (August) and 7.3 m s(-1) (December) for the BPY site. Moreover, QuikSCAT satellite mean values for the grids of the two buoy regions were systematically overestimated in comparison to the buoy data with differences in the range from 8 to 13%. Statistical analysis revealed the high QuikSCAT data uncertainty for wind speeds less than 5 in s(-1) as the major factor of the observed mean value differences. The mean wind power densities were calculated with the buoy wind speed measurements and were found more than 250W m(-2) at 10 m, suggesting the suitability of the sites for offshore wind energy applications. Capacity factors of up to 48% for energy production were calculated with the existing offshore turbines technology at a hub height of 100 in. Furthermore, the energy yield for different wind turbines and a service life of 20 years were determined from 6.5 to 8.7 and the energy pay-back periods from 2.8 to 2.1 years, respectively.

Turbulence generated in the boundary layers of these channels interacts with a turbine to excite the blades into low-to mid-frequency vibration. Additionally, the self-generated turbulent boundary layer on the turbine blade excites its trailing edge into vibration. Both of these hydrodynamic sources generate radiated noise. Being installed in a marine ecosystem, the noise generated by these MHK devices may affect the fish and marine mammal well-being. Since this MHK technology is relatively new, much of the design practice follows that from conventional horizontal axis wind turbines. In contrast to other underwater turbomachines like conventional merchant ships that have solid blades, wind turbine blades are made of hollow fiberglass composites.

Although U. minax adults are generally found at lower salinities than the other two species, the distributions of all three species overlap to some degree. The distribution of megalopae and juvenile fiddler crabs (from first crab stage to those with a carapace width of 3.0 mm) was examined at four sites along a salinity gradient (from 35.0± 2.0% to 3.0± 3.0%; (x) over bar ± SD) in the North Inlet Estuary, South Carolina, USA, in August 2002. A PCR-RFLP technique was developed to identify individuals from the genus Uca to species from first zoea through the early crab stages. An examination of the distribution of early life stages showed that U. minax reinvades low-salinity adult habitats at settlement, following planktonic larval development in the coastal ocean. Also, juveniles of U. pugilator were found to occupy Spartina alterniflora stands, where adult conspecifics rarely occur. Species frequencies were different for adults compared to early life stages in low-salinity areas of the marsh, where populations overlap. Settlement and survival dynamics of early life-history stages in wet and dry years likely determine the distribution of adult Uca spp. populations along salinity gradients in estuarine ecosystems.",,,,,,,,,20,1,0,0,22,1,29,,,0025-3162,,,,,,,,,,,"Univ S Carolina, Dept Biol Sci, Columbia, SC 29208 USAUniv S Carolina, Marine Sci Program, Columbia, SC 29208 USAMed Univ S Carolina, Marine Biomed & Environm Sci Ctr, Charleston, SC 29412 USAUniv S Carolina, LeConte Coll, Dept Stat, Columbia, SC 29208 USAUniv S Carolina, Dept Nat Sci, Beaufort, SC 29902 USA",,,,2005-05-01,WOS:000228974100010,,

Offshore piles must be designed with enough capacity to withstand overturning moments caused by wind turbines and other environmental factors such as wave excitations and extreme winds. In this study, a full-scale field experimental test is undertaken to determine the pile behaviour under various lateral loading conditions. A distributed fiber optic sensing technology is used to measure strains along two instrumented piles. The bending moments and lateral deflections are calculated from distributed fiber optic sensors, and then analysed with the various p-y methods. Field measurements indicated that for two offshore piles ZKO1 and ZK28 with diameter of 2 m and length of 71.5 m and 77.5 m, the maximum lateral movements under a given lateral load of 8001EN were 369.1 mm and 351.7 min, respectively. The maximum bending moment occurred at 6.5 m and 5.5 m below seabed level with the corresponding depth of 12.15D and 11.95D for pile ZKO1 and ZK28, respectively. The position of zero crossing of soil resistance for two instrumented piles is almost the same, even though the piles have different lengths. The lateral deflections and bending moments of the two instrumented piles are predicted by the API and hyperbolic method, which indicates that the hyperbolic method yields larger prediction errors than the API method.

Such damages are critical to the blade's aerodynamic as well as structural performance, ultimately resulting in substantial repair costs. An effective design of a coating material for WTB is necessary and its analysis must include variables associated with erosive rain droplets such as (1) droplet diameter, (2) impact velocity, and (3) droplet impact angle. The present paper develops and validates a coupled fluid structure interaction (FSI) computational model for simulating rain droplet impact on WTBs, where the structure domain is modelled using conventional finite element method (FEM) and the fluid domain is modelled using smooth particle hydrodynamics (SPH). The 3D numerical model, developed in LS-DYNA, is validated with published experimental results. Further, a parametric study is considered to understand the effects of varying droplet size, impact angles and impact velocities on the impact responses of the leading edge coating system subjected to different rainfall conditions. The rainfall conditions considered for the analysis correspond to four different rainfall intensities (I) - light rainfall (2 mm/hr), moderate rainfall (10 mm/hr), heavy rainfall (25 mm/hr), and very heavy rainfall (50 mm/hr). The results show that the impact responses on the coating system increase with increasing droplet size and increasing droplet impact angle with maximum impulses, stresses and damages developed for normal impingement (90 degrees). Also, the effects of droplet impact angles in the range of 50 degrees to 90 degrees are found critical for rainfall intensities representing very heavy rainfall conditions (I > 25 mm/hr). The results of the peak contact forces and impulses for the above combination of variables used in the numerical study are found in satisfactory agreement with analytical formulations developed through published experiments. Finally, repetitive rain droplet impact analyses are considered and number of impacts required for onset of erosion damages are found to increase by more than seven times upon reducing impact velocities from 140 m/s to 80 m/s for very heavy rainfall conditions (I > 25 mm/hr).

We examined the physical environmental (wind, diel cycle, tidal phase) and biological (ontogenetic, density-dependent) factors that contribute to the secondary dispersal of a benthic marine invertebrate, the blue crab (Callinectes sapidus) in Pamlico Sound, NC, USA. Field studies conducted in relatively large (0.05 km(2)) seagrass beds determined that secondary dispersal is primarily undertaken by the earliest juvenile blue crab instar stages (J1 crabs). These crabs emigrated pelagically from seagrass settlement habitats using nighttime flood tides during average wind conditions (speed similar to5 in s(-1)). Moreover, the secondary dispersal of J1 crabs was density-dependent and regulated by intracohort (J1) crab density in seagrass. Our results suggest that dispersal occurs rapidly following settlement, and promotes blue crab metapopulation persistence by redistributing juveniles from high-density settlement habitats to areas characterized by low postlarval supply. Collectively, these data indicate that blue crab secondary dispersal is an active process under behavioral control and can alter initial distribution patterns established during settlement.

The reason is that as wind speed increases, collectable energy from the wind increases by the third power. That is, in a location with 20% higher wind speed, it is possible to generate 73% more power. If 50% higher wind velocity is available, 300% more power and energy can be generated.The 'father of modern day wind power', William Heronemus, former US Nuclear Navy officer, Engineering Professor of the University of Massachusetts, recognized this and therefore proposed offshore wind power plants which helped launch the wind industry in 1972 with his landmark paper (Ref. 1). However, subsequent studies in the US and Europe found that proposed large diameter windmills in offshore installations are relatively uneconomic (Ref. 2, 3) due to a number of unavoidable characteristic features. Recently, Danish wind power firms are finding reasonably promising economic performance when such turbines are limited to very shallow water of 3-5 meters near land where no platform is required to support them (Ref. 4 & 5).However, ENECO's Wind Amplified Rotor Platform (WARP(TM)) technology when applied in spar buoy design configuration has exceptional features and benefits desired by an offshore wind power plant. Namely, it is easily and relatively inexpensively volume produced; can be economically sited in any depth water; can further amplify by as much as 50% to 80% the typically excellent offshore winds; converts wind energy with low cost, highly reliable aircraft-propeller-sized wind turbines requiring no step-up gearboxes. These characteristics result in substantial cost effectiveness and user friendly practicality. Uniquely capable of also integrally converting both wind and solar (photovoltaic cells) energy on common modular WARP system structure, this globally patented renewable energy technology is now being licensed for demonstration and commercialization in various fields-of-use. (Ref. 5).This recently globally patented renewable energy technology has been cited a breakthrough by the National Regulatory Research institute. It was awarded the 1996 Best of What's New-Energy by Popular Science, and has received favorable reviews and featured in OFFSHORE, POWER ENGINEERING and FORTUNE magazines (Ref. 6, 7, 8 & 9), among others, as presented in conferences of the Institute of Electrical & Electronics Engineers (IEEE), the American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME), the American Wind Energy Asociation (AWEA) and the American Power Conference.",,,,,20th British-Wind-Energy-Association Conference on Wind Energy 1998 - Switch on to Wind Power20th British-Wind-Energy-Association Conference on Wind Energy 1998 - Switch on to Wind Power,"SEP 02-04, 1998SEP 02-04, 1998",British Wind Energy AssocBritish Wind Energy Assoc,"CARDIFF UNIV WALES, CARDIFF, WALESCARDIFF UNIV WALES, CARDIFF, WALES",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,1-86058-137-4,,,,,,,,,,,,,1998-01-01,WOS:000078180900041,,

Due to this growth in the utilization of the wind resource and the increasing importance of wind power in Australia's energy mix, this study sets out to analyze and interpret the nature of Australia's wind resources using robust metrics of the abundance, variability and intermittency of wind power density, and analyzes the variation of these characteristics with current and potential wind turbine hub heights. We also assess the extent to which wind intermittency, on hourly or greater timescales, can potentially be mitigated by the aggregation of geographically dispersed wind farms, and in so doing, lessen the severe impact on wind power economic viability of long lulls in wind and power generated. Our results suggest that over much of Australia, areas that have high wind intermittency coincide with large expanses in which the aggregation of turbine output does not mitigate variability. These areas are also geographically remote, some are disconnected from the east coast's electricity grid and large population centers, which are factors that could decrease the potential economic viability of wind farms in these locations. However, on the eastern seaboard, even though the wind resource is weaker, it is less variable, much closer to large population centers, and there exists more potential to mitigate it's intermittency through aggregation.

India today stands at 5th place in the world with regard to wind power utilization. The main technological bather to exploitation of wind energy in India is that the country lies in low wind regimes, which calls for considerable changes in the design of turbine components and in the generator configuration itself to make them optimum for use in the Indian conditions. Most of the wind turbines operative in India are of foreign design or origin which may not be most suited for this purpose. A US-based study presents technology improvement opportunities for low wind speed turbines and associated cost and performance benefits, and hence is highly relevant to India. Further, India has a long coast line which presents tremendous opportunities for offshore wind energy harvesting. Some indigenous efforts have indeed been made towards wind mapping and suitable wind turbine design and development, but there are gaps in domestic capability that need to be plugged for better utilization of wind power. This article presents the current status of the wind power sector and discusses some of the concerned issues. Possible avenues for increased utilization of wind power in the country are also presented.Tidal power has the potential to generate significant amounts of electricity at certain sites around the world. It is a valuable source of clean, renewable energy to an electricity supply system. The negative environmental impacts of tidal energy harvesting are probably much smaller than those of other sources of electricity, but are not well-understood at this time. The technology required for tidal power is well-developed, and the main barrier to increased use of tides is that of construction costs. The future costs of other sources of electricity, and concern over their environmental impacts, will ultimately determine whether humankind would extensively harness tidal energy. Tidal power in the Indian context is addressed taking into account the status, issues, concerns and challenges in the two sites at Sunderbans, West Bengal and Gulf of Kachchh, Gujarat. While tidal energy is a viable resource, it may prove to be expensive at first, but economical in the long run if the technology improves.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,,,0370-0046,,,,,,,,,,,"Aeronaut Dev Agcy, PB 1718, Bangalore 560017, Karnataka, India",,,,2016-01-09,BCI:BCI201600109406,,

The wind resource assessment is costly to observe using traditional meteorological masts and therefore atmospheric modeling is state of the art. However, to reduce the uncertainty on the model results on the offshore wind resource, it is necessary to compare model results with observations. Observations from ground-based wind lidar and satellite remote sensing are the two main technologies that can provide new types of offshore wind data at relatively low cost. The advantages of microwave satellite remote sensing are (1) horizontal spatial coverage, (2) long data archives, and (3) high spatial detail both in the coastal zone and of far-field wind farm wake. Passive microwave ocean wind speed data are available since 1987 with up to six observations per day with near-global coverage. The data are particularly useful for investigation of long-term wind conditions. Scatterometer ocean surface wind vectors provide a continuous series since 1999 with twice-daily near-global coverage. Both types of data have grid cells around 25 km. In contrast, synthetic aperture radar (SAR) wind maps can be retrieved at 1-km grid resolution. SAR-based wind maps have been used for wind resource assessment far offshore and in the coastal zones with good results when compared to e.g., meteorological data and mesoscale model results. High-resolution SAR data show very long far-field wind farm wakes. Thus wind farm wake loss is foreseen in wind farm clusters. (C) 2014 The Authors.

Their cost is approximately 35% of the total cost of this type of project. Different types of support structure have been considered in the offshore wind industry; the most common are steel monopiles, gravity based structures (GBS), jackets and tripods. GBS support structures have been selected as the most suitable in some operating offshore wind facilities, although to date their use has been limited. Some defend the advantages of the GBS concept in deeper locations. Nowadays, the importance of the GBS support structure is obvious. The main objective of this paper is to show the different phases involved in carrying out the installation of GBS for offshore wind facilities. For that purpose, it is necessary to identify the processes and methods employed in the offshore installation of the most relevant types of GBS in offshore wind facilities operating in Europe.

The presented measurement system was tested in a rough offshore environment at Avedore Holme and Gunfleet Sands offshore wind farms.The paper will describe the application of GPS technology in synchronised measurements carried out at Avedore Holme and Gunfleet Sands wind farms. Different aspects of software development and hardware configuration in order to optimise measurement systems reliability during offshore measurements will be presented. Also real-life examples of results from both offshore measurement campaigns will be described. Some limitations, improvements and results of the measurement system will be explained from both harmonic and transient measurements.

The goal is to develop a numerical tool that allows the study of the survivability of floating moored devices under highly energetic sea states, obtaining the optimum mooring layout to increase lifetime. The moorings are modelled by coupling DualSPHysics with MoorDyn, a lumped-mass mooring dynamics model. MoorDyn represents mooring line behaviour subject to axial elasticity, hydrodynamic forces in quiescent water, and vertical contact forces with the seabed. Calculated mooring tensions at the fairlead are added as external forces in order to compute the resulting response and motions of the floating structures in DualSPHysics. The coupled model has been validated against data from scale model tests generated during the experimental campaigns for the European MaRINET2 EsflOWC project. In order to evaluate the accuracy of the coupling implementation with the lumped-mass mooring model, free-surface elevation, motions of the floater and mooring tensions are numerically computed and compared to experimental data. Overall, the results demonstrate the accuracy of the coupling between DualSPHysics and MoorDyn to simulate the motion of a moored floating structure under the action of regular waves.

To partially fill the efficiency gap of these turbines, aerodynamic developments are still needed. This work in particular focuses on the development of a mathematical model that allows predicting the possible performance improvements enabled in a VAWT by application of the Gurney flaps (GFs) as a function of the blade thickness, the rotor solidity and geometry of the Gurney flap itself. The performance of airfoil with GFs was evaluated by means of detailed simulations making use of computational fluid dynamics (CFD). The accuracy of the CFD model was assessed against the results of a dedicated experimental study. In the simulations, a dedicated method to simulate cycles of variation of the angle of attack similar to those taking place in a cycloidal motion (rather than purely sinusoidal ones) was also developed. Based on the results from CFD, a multidimensional interpolation based on the radial basis functions was conducted in order to find the GF design solution that provides the highest efficiency for a given turbine in terms of airfoil and solidity. The results showed that, for the selected study cases based on symmetric airfoils, the GF positioned facing outwards from the turbine, which provides the upwind part of the revolution, can lead to power increments ranging from approximately 30% for the lower-solidity turbine up to 90% for the higher-solidity turbine.

It is also one of the RES which has become economically affordable much before several other RESs have. As a result, next to biomass (and excluding large hydro), wind energy is the RES being most extensively tapped by the world at present. Despite carrying the drawback of intermittency, wind energy has found favor due to its perceived twin virtues of relatively lesser production cost and environment-friendliness.But with increasing use of turbines for harnessing wind energy, the adverse environmental impacts of this RES are increasingly coming to light. The present paper summarizes the current understanding of these impacts and assesses the challenges they are posing. One among the major hurdles has been the NYMBI (not in my backyard) syndrome due to which there is increasing emphasis on installing windfarms several kilometers offshore. But such moves have serious implications for marine life which is already under great stress due to impacts of overfishing, marine pollution, global warming, ozone hole and ocean acidification. Evidence is also emerging that the adverse impacts of wind power plants on wildlife, especially birds and bats, are likely to be much greater than is reflected in the hitherto reported figures of individuals killed per turbine. Likewise recent findings on the impact of noise and flicker generated by the wind turbines indicate that these can have traumatic impacts on individuals who have certain predispositions. But the greatest of emerging concerns is the likely impact of large wind farms on the weather, and possibly the climate. The prospects of wind energy are discussed in the backdrop of these and other rising environmental concerns. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Here, we review and qualitatively describe trends in the occurrence and apparent causes of multiple mortality events (MMEs) in bats around the world. We compiled a database of MMEs, defined as cases in which10 dead bats were counted or estimated at a specific location within a maximum timescale of a year, and more typically within a few days or a season. We tabulated 1180 MMEs within nine categories. Prior to 2000, intentional killing by humans caused the greatest proportion of MMEs in bats. In North America and Europe, people typically killed bats because they were perceived as nuisances. Intentional killing occurred in South America for vampire bat control, in Asia and Australia for fruit depredation control, and in Africa and Asia for human food. Biotic factors, accidents, and natural abiotic factors were also important historically. Chemical contaminants were confirmed causes of MMEs in North America, Europe, and in islands. Viral and bacterial diseases ranked low as causes of MMEs in bats. Two factors led to a major shift in causes of MMEs in bats at around 2000: the global increase of industrial wind-power facilities and the outbreak of white-nose syndrome in North America. Collisions with wind turbines and white-nose syndrome are now the leading causes of reported MMEs in bats. Collectively, over half of all reported MMEs were of anthropogenic origin. The documented occurrence of MMEs in bats due to abiotic factors such as intense storms, flooding, heat waves, and drought is likely to increase in the future with climate change. Coupled with the chronic threats of roosting and foraging habitat loss, increasing mortality through MMEs is unlikely to be compensated for, given the need for high survival in the dynamics of bat populations.",,,,,,,,,206,0,0,0,185,5,241,,,0305-1838,1365-2907,,,,,,,,,,"US Geol Survey, Ft Collins Sci Ctr, Ft Collins, CO 80526 USAMassey Univ, Mol Epidemiol & Publ Hlth Lab, Hopkirk Res Inst, Private Bag 11222, Palmerston North 4442, New ZealandMontana State Univ, Dept Microbiol & Immunol, Bozeman, MT 59717 USAUniv Glasgow, Ctr Virus Res, MRC, Inst Biodivers Anim Hlth & Comparat Med, Glasgow G12 8QQ, Lanark, Scotland",,,,2016-07-01,WOS:000378560700003,29755179,

The social benefit is based upon wind power's energy and capacity services and the avoidance of environmental damages. The approach uses probabilistic load duration curves to account for the stochastic interaction between wind power availability. electricity demand, and conventional generator dispatch. The model is applied to potential offshore wind power development to the south of Long Island, NY. If natural gas combined cycle and integrated gasifier combined cycle (IGCC) are the alternative generation sources, wind power exhibits a negative social benefit due to its high capacity cost and the relatively low emissions of these advanced fossil-fuel technologies. Environmental benefits increase significantly if charges for M emissions Lire included. Results also reveal a diminishing social benefit as wind power penetration increases. The dependence of wind power benefits on CO2 charges, and capital costs for wind turbines and IGCC plant is also discussed.

Response predictions in offshore wind applications are, however, affected by large uncertainties on environmental (wind/wave/soil) as well as system parameters (eigenfrequencies/damping). As a first step towards robust health monitoring in the presence of these uncertainties, a methodology for simultaneous estimation of a response equivalent hydrodynamic loading and a system parameter from measured vibration signals is proposed. Use is made of a recently proposed coupled input-state-parameter estimation technique based on the Extended Kalman filter. The identification process is driven by a limited set of artificially generated vibration response data in combination with an approximate reduced-order model of the support structure. The results show that the proposed method is capable of tracking both the response equivalent hydrodynamic loading and a parameter that is related to the stiffness of the substructure.

One of the failure mechanisms observed at placed scour protection around offshore foundations is suction of sediment through the scour protection and subsequent sinking of the scour protection. Incipient motion of sediment and the initiation of suction underneath scour protections around piles in the marine environment were studied under waves, current and combined waves and current conditions. The motion of a thin layer of sediment underneath the scour protection was studied through the glass bottom of the test flume, which provided a clear view of the initiation of the motion of the sediment. The results show that the mobility depends on the Keulegan-Carpenter number for the pile, the ratio between waves and current flow and the ratio between the thickness of the scour protection and the base sediment. The critical mobility number is smaller for the wave-dominated situation compared to current-dominated conditions, which again are smaller than for combined waves and current conditions. Consequently, larger -numbers cause larger critical mobility numbers than smaller -numbers.

To avoid delays in consenting processes and to streamline the construction and operation phase, functional mitigation measures are required which efficiently reduces bird mortality. Vision is the primary sensory system in birds, which for a number of species also includes the ultraviolet spectrum. Many bird species that are known to collide with offshore wind turbines are sensitive in the violet or ultraviolet spectrum. For species that are mainly active at lower ambient light levels, lighting may deter birds from the lit area. Utilizing (ultra) violet lights may in addition not disturb humans. However, we do not know whether UV-sensitive birds in flight actually respond behaviourally to UV lights.Methods: We therefore tested the efficacy of two types of lights within the violet (400 nm) and ultraviolet (365 nm) spectrum to deter birds from the lit area. These lights were placed vertically and monitored continuously between dusk and dawn using an avian radar system.Results: Relative to control nights, bird flight activity (abundance) was 27% lower when the ultraviolet light was on. Violet light resulted in a 12% decrease in overall abundance, and in addition, a vertical displacement was seen, increasing the average flight altitude by 7 m. Although temporal changes occurred, this effect persisted over the season below 40 m above sea level.Conclusions: Although the results from this pilot study are promising, we argue there still is a long way to go before a potentially functional design to mitigate collisions that has proven to be effective in situ may be in place.",,,,,,,,,6,0,0,0,4,0,6,,,2053-7166,,,,,,,,,,,"Norwegian Inst Nat Res, Terr Ecol Dept, Trondheim, NorwaySteinoysund, Smola, Norway",Steinoysund,,,2018-01-11,WOS:000418951500001,,

In this study, a finite element analysis of the crack growth from corrosion pits has been performed and the results are presented in order to provide an estimate of the extent of damage after the crack is detected. A Python script have been developed which generates the pit profiles based on a non-uniform random distribution of pit dimensions. 3D pits and elliptical cracks are embedded at critical points of weldment on the mooring point and analysed using ABAQUS XFEM.

Although the study finds striking similarities among the particular approaches embraced by each corporate actor, it also notes that approaches are technology and firm specific, and the potential for different permutations leads to an almost endless number of possible stylistic combinations.

However, the performance assessment of offshore wind turbine (OWT) structure is a challenging task due to the combined wind-wave loading and difficulties in reproducing such loading conditions in laboratory. Real-time hybrid simulation (RTHS), combining physical testing and numerical simulation in real-time, offers a new venue to study the structural behavior of OWTs. It overcomes the scaling incompatibilities in OWT scaled model testing by replacing the rotor components with an actuation system, driven by an aerodynamic simulation tool running in real-time. In this study, a RTHS framework for monopile OWTs is proposed. A set of sensitivity analyses is carried out to evaluate the feasibility of this RTHS framework and determine possible tolerances on its design. By simulating different scaling laws and possible error contributors (delays and noises) in the proposed framework, the sensitivity of the OWT responses to these parameters are quantified. An example using a National Renewable Energy Lab (NREL) 5-MW reference OWT system at 1:25 scale is simulated in this study to demonstrate the proposed RTHS framework and sensitivity analyses. Three different scaling laws are considered. The sensitivity results show that the delays in the RTHS framework significantly impact the performance on the response evaluation, higher than the impact of noises. The proposed framework and sensitivity analyses presented in this study provides important information for future implementation and further development of the RTHS technology for similar marine structures.

Effective modelling of how this affects the populations has to take account of the location and timing of disturbances. Here we construct an individual-based model of harbour porpoises in the Inner Danish Waters. Individuals have their own energy budgets constructed using established principles of physiological ecology. Data are lacking on the spatial distribution of food which is instead inferred from knowledge of time-varying porpoise distributions. The model produces plausible patterns of population dynamics and matches well the age distribution of porpoises caught in by-catch. It estimates the effect of existing wind farms as a 10% reduction in population size when food recovers fast (after two days). Proposed new wind farms and ships do not result in further population declines. The population is however sensitive to variations in mortality resulting from by-catch and to the speed at which food recovers after being depleted. If food recovers slowly the effect of wind turbines becomes negligible, whereas ships are estimated to have a significant negative impact on the population. Annual by-catch rates >10% lead to monotonously decreasing populations and to extinction, and even the estimated by-catch rate from the adjacent area (approximately 4.1%) has a strong impact on the population. This suggests that conservation efforts should be more focused on reducing by-catch in commercial gillnet fisheries than on limiting the amount of anthropogenic noise. Individual-based models are unique in their ability to take account of the location and timing of disturbances and to show their likely effects on populations. The models also identify deficiencies in the existing database and can be used to set priorities for future field research. (C) 2013 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

This paper firstly analyzes the irrationality of China's energy consumption structure and,the necessity for developing offshore wind power. Secondly, an overview of offshore wind farm access, AC (Alternating Current) and DC (Direct Current) transmission technologies and offshore wind turbine control strategies are given. The development status and future plans of offshore wind power are also introduced. Finally, we analyze the existing problems and obstacles during the construction process of offshore wind farms from three aspects, including technical, economic, and national policies.

With this in mind, the paper includes the following sections: introduction, methodology used for the research project, conditioning factors, methodological proposal for the design of offshore wind farms, checking the methodological proposal, and conclusions.",,,,,11th International Coastal Symposium (ICS)11th International Coastal Symposium (ICS),"MAY 09-13, 2011MAY 09-13, 2011","Univ Szczecin, Inst Marine & Coastal Sci; Coastal Educ & Res Fdn; Univ Szczecinski (US); Cztowiek Nauka Srodowisko (CNS); ZMGM; Reg Dyrekcja Ochrony Srodowiska; Esri; Springer; Lotos; GA2 Syst; World Sci; Helmholtz-Zentrum Geesthacht; Nfosigm; Urzad Marszalkowski Wojewodztwa Zachodniopomorskiego; Wojewodzki Fundusz Ochrony Srodowiska I Gospodarki Wodnej W GdanskuUniv Szczecin, Inst Marine & Coastal Sci; Coastal Educ & Res Fdn; Univ Szczecinski (US); Cztowiek Nauka Srodowisko (CNS); ZMGM; Reg Dyrekcja Ochrony Srodowiska; Esri; Springer; Lotos; GA2 Syst; World Sci; Helmholtz-Zentrum Geesthacht; Nfosigm; Urzad Marszalkowski Wojewodztwa Zachodniopomorskiego; Wojewodzki Fundusz Ochrony Srodowiska I Gospodarki Wodnej W Gdansku","Szczecin, POLANDSzczecin, POLAND",16,0,0,0,3,0,16,,,0749-0208,1551-5036,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Politecn Madrid, Res Grp Marine Coastal & Port Environm & Other Se, E-28040 Madrid, Spain",,,,2012-05-23,WOS:000302824900103,,

The risk of seabirds colliding with offshore wind turbines is influenced by flight height, and flight height data usually come from observers on boats, making estimates in daylight in fine weather. GPS tracking provides an alternative and generates flight height information in a range of conditions, but the raw data have associated error. Here, we present a novel analytical solution for accommodating GPS error. We use Bayesian state-space models to describe the flight height distributions and the error in altitude measured by GPS for lesser black-backed gulls and great skuas, tracked throughout the breeding season. We also examine how location and light levels influence flight height. Lesser black-backed gulls flew lower by night than by day, indicating that this species would be less likely to encounter turbine blades at night, when birds' ability to detect and avoid them might be reduced. Gulls flew highest over land and lowest near the coast. For great skuas, no significant relationships were found between flight height, time of day and location. We consider four collision risk windows', corresponding to the airspace swept by rotor blades for different offshore wind turbine designs. We found the highest proportion of birds at risk for a 22-250 m turbine (up to 9% for great skuas and 34% for lesser black-backed gulls) and the lowest for a 30-258m turbine. Our results suggest lesser black-backed gulls are at greater risk of collision than great skuas, especially by day.Synthesis and applications. Our novel modelling approach is an effective way of resolving the error associated with GPS tracking data. We demonstrate its use on GPS measurements of altitude, generating important information on how breeding seabirds use their environment. This approach and the associated data also provide information to improve avian collision risk assessments for offshore wind farms.

Due to their low flammability and resistance to moisture, their performance is optimal in offshore platforms. Nonetheless, their thermal-electrical degradation must be carefully considered given the special wind and weather conditions in marine environments. The present paper studies the thermal aging of dry-type WTSU transformers in offshore wind farms considering the most thermally stressed location i.e. the winding hot-spot. The estimation of the transformer lifetime consumption introduced in this work can be applied in the framework of digital twins for diagnostic and prognostic monitoring purposes The thermal degradation study is based on a typical offshore load profile and includes the analysis of the impact of several transformer characteristics and operating conditions. As a result of the analysis, it can be concluded that lower temperature insulations, forced air cooling systems, a lower mean winding temperature rise and cool ambient temperatures lead to decreased loss of life values. Also, the present work suggests the suitability of considering thermal degradation studies as an optimal sizing factor for offshore WTSU given the low ambient temperatures in marine environment and the low capacity factors.",,,,,,,,,2,1,0,0,0,0,2,,,,1309-0127,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Basque Country, UPV EHU, Dept Elect Engn, Ing Torres Quevedo 1, Bilbao 48013, SpainTecnalia Res & Innovat, Energy & Environm Div, Derio 48160, Spain",Tecnalia Res & Innovat,,,2020-04-10,WOS:000521936400043,,

The concept should further improve the situational and spatial awareness as well as the workload of helicopter pilots when operating in challenging surroundings. The display concept is applied to two helicopter offshore operations and its specific obstacle situation. The first operation represents a hoist operation at the lower access point of an offshore wind turbine. The second regards an offshore platform landing operation. The paper depicts the two use cases, related work concerning obstacle awareness and warning systems, and recapitulates situational awareness plus the properties of orthogonal coplanar in comparison to the properties of perspective representations.

The response to realistic environmental loading histories (10 min duration) are simulated, then followed by numerical rotor-stop tests for global damping estimation.While linking to existing literature, all FE results are critically inspected to gain insight relevant to geo-technical design. The modelling tools adopted (i) support the robustness of 'soft-stiff foundation design with respect to natural frequency shifts, even during severe storm events; (ii) provide values of foundation damping in line with field measurements; (iii) suggest that pore pressure effects might more likely affect soil-monopile interaction under weak-to-moderate environmental loading.",,,,,,,,,57,0,0,0,0,0,57,,,0267-7261,1879-341X,,,,,,,,,,"Delft Univ Technol, Fac Civil Engn & Geosci, Stevinweg 1, NL-2628 CN Delft, NetherlandsRINA Consulting SpA, Geo & Struct Div, Palazzo R,Via Gran S Bernardo, I-20089 Rozzano, ItalySiemens Gamesa Renewable Energy, Prinses Beatrixlaan 800, NL-2595 BN The Hague, Netherlands",RINA Consulting SpASiemens Gamesa Renewable Energy,,,2019-05-01,WOS:000463130500015,,

The main idea behind the method is that instead of estimating the spectra and apply Operational Modal Analysis (OMA) by using them, the socalled orders can be extracted and used as input for the OMA technique. It can be assumed that the measured responses are mainly caused by the rotational excitation. In this case, run-up and coast-down events can be assimilated to multi-sine sweep excitation in the frequency band of interest. Several studies have been performed to identify the best practice for OBMA both in terms of Order Tracking (OT) techniques and OMA techniques. Based on the boundary conditions, on the structure under-test and on the effective operational conditions a technique can be more powerful than another one. Basically there are two fundamental steps: a very good measurement of the tachometer signal and the correct extraction of the orders, both in amplitude and phase. For the first step several alternatives are possible. The sensors to be used for measuring the rotational speed are depending from both the application and the objective of the study. For this reason, several sensors can be found in the market with a huge variety of costs and performances. The best sensor can then be selected for each individual application based on the type of analysis, the accessibility of the shaft, the ease of instrumentation and the required accuracy or level of detail. For the second step, several techniques are available in commercial software and some others have been implemented in a research environment. Each of them has its own advantages and drawbacks. The final aim of the work is to provide guidelines for the correct use of the OBMA technique in an industrial context. Several cases will be shown: a locomotive cabin and a car during engine run-ups and a 3.2MW wind turbine gearbox during controlled run-ups on a test rig.",,,,,35th IMAC Conference and Exposition on Structural Dynamics35th IMAC Conference and Exposition on Structural Dynamics,"JAN 30-FEB 02, 2017JAN 30-FEB 02, 2017",Soc Expt Mech; IMACSoc Expt Mech; IMAC,"Garden Grove, CAGarden Grove, CA",4,0,0,0,0,0,4,,,2191-5644,2191-5652,978-3-319-54810-4; 978-3-319-54809-8,,,,,,,,,"Siemens Ind Software, Interleuvenlaan 68, B-3001 Leuven, BelgiumUniv Naples Federico II, Dept Ind Engn, Via Claudio 21, I-80125 Naples, ItalyKatholieke Univ Leuven, Div PMA, Celestijnenlaan 300B, B-3001 Heverlee, Belgium",,,,2018-03-13,WOS:000426345900009,,

In this work, simplified forms of the damages are assumed, random damages are imposed on the jacket structure, and damaged indicators are established from combination of modal shapes. Then, a response surface is constructed mapping the damage indicators and damages. Given that the efficiency of the damage identification depends on the locations of the damages and the location and number of sensor locations, a sensitivity study is performed to vary sensor location, sensor quantity, and damage severity. It is found that the effect of damage identification is better when sensor locations are closer to damage locations, and this effect is more sensitive to sensor placements when damages occur in the upper structures.

In order to formulate an optimisation algorithm, the complex context the industry is operating in needs to be understood. However this may be a step to far. The complexity of unknown factors in an emerging and growing wind offshore industry will demonstrate that alongside to computational optimisation and academic problem formulation of individual sub tasks, what will be needed is human intuition, vision, innovation, engineering judgment and the masterminds which influence the outcome of their endeavour in a positive way. Firstly, an overview of cost categories is given ranging from material cost to finance cost. Secondly examples of risks and design obstacles are mapped, both in order to present the backdrop in front of which various strategies for delivery can be chosen.Examples of structural optimisation taking into account some of the key cost drivers are presented at the heart of the paper, showing how different boundary constraints and design approaches will lead to different design solutions.

The slamming forces should thus be properly considered during the design, but a suitable force model specifically for jacket structures is currently in absence. In this study, a five-parameter force model is developed for estimating global slamming forces due to plunging breaking waves on jacket structures, based on statistical analyses of experimental data from the WaveSlam project. The force model is developed by considering a total of 176 individual breaking waves, under six wave conditions. For each individual breaking wave, the time history of the slamming force is calculated based on hammer test data in addition to wave test data, and the wave parameters are acquired from a wave elevation measurement. The acquired time histories and wave parameters are then used to determine the parameters involved in the force model, including two exponential parameters (i.e. alpha(l) and alpha(2)) and three dimensionless coefficients for the expressions of wave-dependent parameters (i.e. duration coefficient zeta(1), rising time coefficient zeta(2), and peak force coefficient zeta(3)). It is found that alpha(l), alpha(2), zeta(1) and zeta(2) are approximately constant, and zeta(3) follows a lognormal distribution. The quantile that determines zeta(3) should be carefully selected so as to provide a conservative prediction. A quantile of 95% is suggested in this paper, and it is found to be conservative based on the verification of the developed force model. Therefore, for a given sea state, this force model can give a deterministic and conservative prediction of the slamming force time history, regardless of the randomness of slamming forces.

In terms of the uncertainty of renewable generation and to allow optimal capacity allocation for an SAMS, a combination of a Monte Carlo simulation, an enhanced charged system search algorithm and a Pareto-based fuzzy decision-making method is used in this study. The objectives considered are the minimisation of both the levelised cost of energy (LCOE) and the expected energy not supplied. An efficient scheme that reduces the convergence time is also developed. The proposed method is tested using an SAMS that is located on an offshore island of Taiwan.

In the literature and the public debate, these on-land siting difficulties are often put forward to be related to the perceived environmental costs of wind turbines. However, offshore wind power generation might be a solution to this problem, if the perceived environmental costs are smaller offshore compared with on-land. Based on a review of seven papers focusing on the preferences and willingness to pay for different wind power development sites, people in different countries generally seem to hold significant preferences of offshore wind power development when compared with different types of locations on-land. However, the preferences for offshore wind power development seem to be dependent on the specific place of location offshore. This points towards the fact that offshore locations potentially can have higher environmental costs than on-land locations. However, the preferences for offshore locations strongly indicate that the environmental costs can be significantly reduced by the location of offshore wind forms at large distances from the coast.

In addition, a torque-pitch controller and the AeroDyn module are integrated within the coupled tool for evaluating the power performance of the tidal turbines under dynamic inflow conditions. Experimental data and numerical results obtained by OpenFAST are used to verify the accuracy of the coupled tool in predicting dynamic responses of the integrated energy system. The dynamic responses and power production under different environmental conditions are obtained by conducting a series of simulations. The results indicate that the total power production is increased by 3.84% to 6.46%.

These substrates are densely colonized by fouling organisms, which may compete for the available resources. While the distribution of some species is restricted to specific parts of the turbine, others occur across depth zones and may therefore face different competitive environments. Here we investigate the trophic niches of seven invertebrate species: three sessile (Diadumene cincta, Metridium senile, and Mytilus edulis), one hemi-sessile (Jassa herdmani) and three mobile species (Ophiothrix fragilis, Necora puber, and Pisidia longicornis) that occur in multiple depth zones. We hypothesized that these species would be trophic generalists, exhibiting trophic plasticity by selecting different resources in different depth zones, to cope with the different competitive environments in which they occur. We analyzed delta13C and delta15N of these species and their potential resources across depth zones. Our results show that most of these invertebrates are indeed trophic generalists which display substantial trophic plasticity, selecting different resources in different zones. Degree of trophic plasticity was not related to mobility of the species. There are two possible explanations for these dietary changes with depth: either consumers switch diet to avoid competition with other (dominant) species, or they benefit from the consumption of a non-limiting resource. Only Diadumene cincta was a trophic specialist that consumed suspended particulate organic matter (SPOM) independent of its zone of occurrence.

The seabed foundation alternatives, a monopile and a multipod foundation, are compared under monotonic, cyclic, and seismic loading. For all nonseismic scenarios considered, the monopile is more flexible than the jacket and transmits higher rotations at the OWT base. The differences between the two alternatives are amplified in the case of nonsymmetric cyclic loading; the monopile not only deforms more than the jacket but tends to accumulate irrecoverable rotation with increasing loading cycles. The seismic performance of the alternative support structures is assessed for a comprehensive set of earthquake motions. It is concluded that both systems are seismically robust especially when subjected to pure earthquake loading, neglecting the simultaneous action of wind and waves. Alarming issues for OWT performance may arise when a nonzero steady wind force is superimposed to the kinematically induced stressing of the seabed foundation due to the seismic wave action. Jacket legs settle unevenly, while monopiles are building up rotations at increasing rates. Assuming a design-level earthquake and a wind thrust of the order 60% of the NC wind loading amplitude, this seismically induced residual rotation for the monopile may often exceed the deformation tolerance criterion. For the same loading combination, the corresponding rotation of the Jacket installation remains safely within the prescribed limits.",,,,,"36th ASME International Conference on Ocean, Offshore and Arctic Engineering (OMAE) / Symposium on Safety of Marine Structures and Operations in Honor of Torgeir Moan36th ASME International Conference on Ocean, Offshore and Arctic Engineering (OMAE) / Symposium on Safety of Marine Structures and Operations in Honor of Torgeir Moan","JUN 25-30, 2017JUN 25-30, 2017","ASME, Ocean Offshore & Arctic Engn DivASME, Ocean Offshore & Arctic Engn Div","Trondheim, NORWAYTrondheim, NORWAY",6,0,0,0,0,0,6,,,0892-7219,1528-896X,,,,,,,,,,"Grid Engineers PC, Pampouki 3, Athens 15451, GreeceNatl Tech Univ Athens, Sch Civil Engn, Dept Geotech Engn, 9 Iroon Polytech St, Zografos 15780, GreeceUniv Thessaly, Dept Mech Engn, Volos 38334, Volos, GreeceUniv Edinburgh, Sch Engn, Dept Struct Engn, Sanderson Bldg,Robert Stevenson Rd,Kings Bldg, Edinburgh EH9 3FB, Midlothian, Scotland",Grid Engineers PC,,,2020-01-24,WOS:000506894500015,,

Power electronics can generate thermal loads in the hundreds of watts/cm(2), therefore the design of the packaging and cooling of the electronics is crucial for enhancing their energy efficiency and reliability. Without adequate heat removal, the increase in device temperature will reduce the efficiency of power electronic devices, leading to thermal runaway and eventual failure of the entire power electronic system. Furthermore, the increased temperatures can lead to failure of the packaging elements.

Drawing upon the successful Stellwagen Bank National Marine Sanctuary model, we propose a multi-stakeholder marine spatial planning process that considers both appropriate positioning of offshore wind farms and redefining commercial shipping lanes relative to whale migration routes: placement of wind turbines within certain right whale habitats may prove beneficial for the species. To that end, it may be advisable to initially relocate the shipping lanes for the benefit of the whales prior to selecting wind energy areas. The optimal end-state is the commercial viability of renewable energy, as well as a safe shipping infrastructure, with minimal risk of collision and exposure to shipping noise for the whales. This opportunity to manage impacts on right whales could serve as a model for other problematic interactions between marine life and commercial activities. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Offshore wind energy is one of the most promising and developed low-carbon generation technologies. However, the high capital costs, which are strongly dependent on seabed depth, currently limit the geographical expansion of this technology to areas with relatively shallow waters and appropriate wind resource. This, along with the advantages of sharing a submarine transmission system among several projects, leads to a high concentration of offshore wind farms in certain zones, as happens, for example, in the North Sea. The presence of other neighbouring offshore wind farms has to be taken into account when a developer plans a new project, since the wake effect of wind turbines belonging to other neighbouring wind farms will affect the annual energy production and, consequently, the profitability of the project under study. However, not only already operating or installed neighbouring projects have to be borne in mind, but also the possible design of future neighbouring wind farms yet to be developed. In order to tackle this issue, an innovative co-evolutionary algorithm is proposed in this paper with the objective of determining a Nash equilibrium solution that would provide the best possible configuration of the wind farm under study by taking into account and limiting the disturbance introduced by other neighbouring projects. The performance of the proposed methodology has been successfully tested through the analysis of a realistic case and compared with other collaborative approaches and the classic single-project optimization methods already existing in the literature.",,,,,,,,,23,1,0,0,0,0,23,,,0306-2619,1872-9118,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Seville, Dept Elect Engn, Seville 41092, Spain",,,,2018-01-11,WOS:000418968500013,,

Here, we apply an industry wind turbine power curve to simulations of high and low future emissions scenarios in an ensemble of ten fully coupled global climate models to investigate large-scale changes in wind power across the globe. Our calculations reveal decreases in wind power across the Northern Hemisphere mid-latitudes and increases across the tropics and Southern Hemisphere, with substantial regional variations. The changes across the northern mid-latitudes are robust responses over time in both emissions scenarios, whereas the Southern Hemisphere changes appear critically sensitive to each individual emissions scenario. In addition, we find that established features of climate change can explain these patterns: polar amplification is implicated in the northern mid-latitude decrease in wind power, and enhanced land-sea thermal gradients account for the tropical and southern subtropical increases.",,,,,,,,,126,5,0,0,22,0,141,,,1752-0894,1752-0908,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Colorado, Dept Atmospher & Ocean Sci, Boulder, CO 80309 USAUniv Colorado, Cooperat Inst Res Environm Sci, Boulder, CO 80309 USAUniv Colorado, Renewable & Sustainable Energy Inst, Boulder, CO 80309 USA",,,,2018-01-01,WOS:000423842000016,,

To migrate up estuary, glass eels synchronize their swimming activity to the flood tide and remain on or in the substratum during ebb tide. Following seven days of exposure to MeHg (100 ng L-1), glass eels migration behavior was expressed by their swimming synchronization to the water current reversal every 6.2 h (mimicking the alternation of flood and ebb tides) and their swimming activity level. In relation to their behavior, we then analyzed the energy-related gene expression levels in individual head, viscera and muscle. Results showed that MeHg decreased the number of glass eels synchronized to the change in water current direction and their swimming activity level. This last effect was more pronounced in non-synchronized fish than in synchronized ones, supporting the idea that non-synchronized glass eels could be more vulnerable to stress. As regard the expression of energy-related genes, no significant difference was observed between control and MeHg-exposed fish. In contrast, when the swimming activity levels were plotted against transcriptional responses, positive correlations were evidenced in viscera and especially in the head of exposed glass eels but not in control. Finally, it is noteworthy that non-synchronized glass eels displayed lower expression level of metabolism genes than their synchronized counterpart, but only in the head. Altogether, these results support the interest of focusing on the head to investigate the facultative migration behavior in glass eels and the effect of environmental stressors on this rhythmic behavior.

Since several terrestrial studies indicate that raptors are especially susceptible to wind turbine related mortality, a Spatial Planning Tool is needed so that wind farms can be sited, in an optimal way, to minimize risk of collisions. Here we use measurements of body mass, wingspan and wing area of eight European raptor species, to calculate their Best Glide Ratio (BGR). The BGR was used to construct a linear equation, which, by the use of initial take-off altitude, could be used to calculate a Theoretical Maximum Distance (TMD) from the coast, attained by these soaring-gliding raptor species. If the nearest turbine, of future marine wind farms, is placed farther away from the coast than the estimated TMD, the collision risk between the turbine blades and these gliding raptors will be minimized. The tool was demonstrated in a case study at the Rodsand II wind farm in Denmark. Data on raptor migration altitude were gathered by radar. From the TMD attained by registered soaring-gliding raptors in the area, we concluded that the Rodsand II wind farm is not sited ideally, from an ornithological point of view, as potentially all three registered species are at risk of gliding through the area swept by the turbine rotor blades, and thereby at risk of colliding with the wind turbines.",,,,,,,,,9,0,0,0,6,0,10,,,0364-152X,1432-1009,,,,,,,,,,"Aarhus Univ, Dept Biol, DK-8000 Aarhus, DenmarkAarhus Univ, Dept Wildlife Ecol & Biodivers, Natl Environm Res Inst, DK-8410 Ronde, Denmark",,,,2010-11-01,WOS:000283360300013,20711780,

As it will be shown, this can lead to significant changes of their behaviour under external loading, which can potentially compromise the foundation's stability or serviceability.The paper will also analyse some singular effects of an irregular loading (e.g. cyclic loading with variable amplitude), in particular the so-called order effects and the phenomena arising during a realistic storm of moderate magnitude, and discuss their potential for transient damages to the foundation's stiffness.All these phenomena, which can lead to a loss of serviceability of the structure, have been investigated by the authors by means of a coupled bi-phasic analytical model of the offshore foundation featuring a versatile constitutive law suitable for the soil. The constitutive model, in the frame of the theory of Generalized Plasticity, can reproduce some complex features of cyclic soil behaviour such as the tendency for a progressive densification under cyclic loading, which is responsible for the soil liquefaction phenomena in undrained conditions.Finally, some implications of these issues for the practical design of offshore monopiles will be discussed and some specific recommendations for the design procedures will be outlined.",,,,,"31st ASME International Conference on Ocean, Offshore and Arctic Engineering31st ASME International Conference on Ocean, Offshore and Arctic Engineering","JUL 01-06, 2012JUL 01-06, 2012","Petrobras; ASME, Ocean Offshore & Arct Engn DivPetrobras; ASME, Ocean Offshore & Arct Engn Div","Rio de Janeiro, BRAZILRio de Janeiro, BRAZIL",6,1,0,0,0,0,7,,,,,978-0-7918-4491-5,,,,,,,,,"BAM Fed Inst Mat Res & Testing, Div Bldg & Struct 7 2, Unter Eichen 87, D-12205 Berlin, Germany",,,,2013-11-14,WOS:000324655900026,,

Here, we present a life cycle assessment (LCA) on a cradle-to-gate basis for the production of the following large volume organic chemicals: methanol, ethylene, propylene, benzene, toluene, and mixed xylenes. Investigated process chains comprise the following technologies: CO2 capture from an industrial point-source or from the atmosphere through direct air capture (DAC); alkaline water electrolysis for hydrogen production; methanol synthesis; methanol-to-olefins and methanol-to-aromatics synthesis including aromatics separation. Electricity is supplied by offshore wind turbines. The system boundary includes all relevant processes from cradle to gate. A scenario was set up by exchanging the background processes for the production of important infrastructure materials like aluminum, copper, steel, and concrete with future processes that are less resource intensive, less carbon intensive and include higher recycling rates (e.g., electric arc furnaces for steel production). LCA results show that the synthesis of the investigated chemicals from CCU processes will reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 88-97%, compared to fossil-based production routes, when electricity from offshore wind turbines is used. At the same time, other environmental impacts like eutrophication and ozone depletion will increase. The main contributors to the environmental impacts are the energy supply for water electrolysis and direct air capture. Replacement of all plants for the production of the investigated products in Germany with CCU processes would lead to a 2-7% higher total primary energy demand for the whole country. At the same time, an overall reduction of the German GHG emissions by 6% is achieved, when using offshore wind power for these processes only. The future scenario using improved background technologies leads to a further small reduction of GHG emissions and largely reduces other environmental impacts. We therefore identify the reduction of emissions through improved base material production processes and recycling of aluminum, copper, steel and concrete as main objectives to reduce negative impacts for the production of basic chemicals from CCU technologies.",,,,,,,,,26,0,0,0,2,0,26,,,,2624-9553,,,,,,,,,,"Inst Energy & Environm Res, Heidelberg, Germany",Inst Energy & Environm Res,,,2020-10-16,WOS:001024782900001,,

The number of large wind power schemes that have failed is growing. The case analysed here is a near-shore wind farm in the Dutch part of the Wadden Sea, in 2001 the largest wind project (278 MW) ever proposed in the Netherlands. The government refused to negotiate with civil society organizations representing various landscape values, primarily with the WaddenVereniging and its allies. The often suggested idea that siting wind farms offshore could solve the problems encountered onshore is naive and far too simple. Siting issues offshore are just as relevant as onshore, as this case study illustrates. As most current offshore developments, the case concerns a near-shore development. It would have been highly visible in an iconic landscape. In such cases, the main dialogue is similar to onshore schemes. which is about impact on the landscape, or 'seascape', as perceived by the public. The paper provides description of the historical development of the area, highlighting significant scenic and ecological values, as well as cultural heritage and its importance for tourism and the rural economy. The acceptability and the assessment of different qualities in relation to wind farm siting are analysed with a survey among members of the WaddenVereniging, the national environmental organization for the protection of the Wadden region. The analysis reveals that these environmentalists with their strong identification with the landscape, believe that there are suitable sites for wind turbines in this sensitive area. However, the spatial layout that was chosen by the developers was based on a landscape assessment of the governmental architect. This was a highly technocratic, top-down decision that did not take account of the landscape preferences of the public. This decision evoked its opposition, and eventually, the WaddenVereniging succeeded in generating sufficient national political support to scupper this project. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

The various basic aspects of wind generation including basics of wind power statistics, wind farm, wake-effect, and environmental effects on wind generation have also been discussed. For the practical analysis of power system with wind generation, accurate wind generation models must be developed with load flow methods that can be integrated in to the normal power system algorithm to cater the need of inclusion of uncertainty in power system. So, various wind turbine generator models and deterministic load flow methods for transmission and distribution system have also been reviewed. The intermittent and fluctuating nature of wind power injected into the grid causes variations in bus voltages and line power flows of transmission system which is going to be quite significant in the future. So, for the successful integration of wind generation in the grid, these variations need to be analyzed, estimated and quantified, which can be achieved through probabilistic load flow. The various probabilistic load flow methods along with application and extension have also been reviewed. The correlation between wind generators in a wind farm has also been discussed. For the successful operation of power system with wind, it is mandatory to have power system planning and contingency analysis with uncertainty. The different methods used in power system planning and contingency analysis have also been reviewed. For the integration of wind generation to be viable, it must be cost effective and free of technical abnormalities. A review on the technical and economic issues related to the integration has also been done. Finally, with the increase in installation of offshore wind farms, HVDC application with wind farms has also increased. So, HVDC techniques with wind generation have also been reviewed in detail.

However, fatigue design based on numerical simulations is quite uncertain. One main reason for this uncertainty is scattering offshore conditions combined with a limited number of simulations (samples). According to current standards, environmental conditions are sampled using a deterministic grid of the most important environmental conditions (e.g., wind speed and direction, significant wave height, and wave period). Recently, there has been some effort to reduce the inherent uncertainty of damage calculations due to limited data by applying other sampling concepts. Still, the investigation of this uncertainty and of methods to reduce it is a subject of ongoing research. In this work, two improved sampling conceptspreviously proposed by the authors and reducing the uncertainty due to limited samplingare validated. The use of strain measurement data enables a realistic estimate of the inherent uncertainty due to limited samples, as numerical effects, etc., are excluded. Furthermore, an extensive data set of three years of data of two turbines of the Belgian wind farm Northwind is available. It is demonstrated that two previously developed sampling methods are generally valid. For a broad range of model types (i.e., input dimensions as well as degrees of non-linearity), they outperform standard sampling concepts such as deterministic grid sampling or Monte Carlo sampling.

While offshore wind power makes no exception, model testing has not shown its full potential due to inherent modeling challenges. Generating highly-controlled wind fields in ocean basins and alleviating aerodynamic modeling errors due to Reynolds number mismatch in Froude-based scaling are prominent examples. To circumvent these issues, the concept of Real-Time Hybrid Model (ReaTHM) testing has been suggested by SINTEF Ocean and NTNU, Norway. Here the wind loads are no longer physically modeled but computed from online-measured motions and a numerical wind field. They are then actuated in real time on the scale model by means of actuators, while subjected to -physical- wave and current loads.This paper aims at presenting design considerations regarding the choice of the actuator(s) and its/their interface with the scale model. The pros and cons of the chosen solution, namely cable-driven parallel robots using industrial servo drives, are presented. The focus is then directed toward the mapping between wind loads to be actuated and tension commands on each cable, called tension allocation. Two layouts corresponding to two ReaTHM testing campaigns performed in SINTEF Ocean's ocean basin are then compared on various aspects, with emphasis on tension allocation.In addition to proving the feasibility of the chosen technical solution, results show a trade-off between flexibility (with respect among others to wind direction) and usability on other structures versus minimization of cable tensions. The latter aspect is treated in detail, using theory first adapted from literature on cable-driven parallel robots, then illustrated through relevant examples for the current application.",,,,,15th Deep Sea Offshore Wind R and D Conference (EERA DeepWind)15th Deep Sea Offshore Wind R and D Conference (EERA DeepWind),"JAN 17-18, 2018JAN 17-18, 2018",NTNU; European Energy Res Alliance; European Energy Res Alliance Joint Programme Wind Energy; Res Council NorwayNTNU; European Energy Res Alliance; European Energy Res Alliance Joint Programme Wind Energy; Res Council Norway,"SINTEF, Trondheim, NORWAYSINTEF, Trondheim, NORWAY",15,0,0,0,0,0,16,,,1742-6588,1742-6596,*****************,,,,,,,,,"NTNU, Dept Marine Technol, N-7491 Trondheim, NorwaySINTEF Ocean, POB 4762, N-7465 Trondheim, NorwayNTNU, Dept Marine Technol, Ctr Autonomous Marine Operat & Syst NTNU AMOS, N-7491 Trondheim, Norway",,,,2018-01-01,WOS:000546234600021,,

The majority of existing designs for tidal energy devices utilize sea-bed mounted turbine energy converters. These underwater devices however present many challenges related to economic and technical viability in terms of their installations and maintenances cost. In recent years, a floating type tidal energy device is being developed. The installation of such a device comprises of single or multiple turbines mounted on a floating platform anchored to the sea-bed with mooring lines. Research and industry teams in China and UK have presented multiple demonstrations both on a model scale and a full scale floating tidal energy converter. All of the results add credibility to their technical feasibility and cost effective nature as compared to fixed turbines. Despite the advantages of floating tidal current turbines (FTCT) over their fixed counterparts, the existing design guidance is not deemed to be ready for the commercial market. The key challenges include guaranteeing the safety of supporting platform and floating mooring lines, the survivability of large scale rotor under extreme sea conditions, the accurate assessment for the proper site selection and the reliable evaluation of environmental impacts. Existing industry design tools rely very much on the simplified models or individual component design rules which negatively impact the energy extraction process/amount/supply. The proposed project aims to integrate the work already carried out at University of Strathclyde in UK in the field of offshore renewable energy and floating offshore structure with the work performed at (a) Harbin Engineering University in China in the area of floating tidal turbine and (b) Ocean University of China in China in the field of tidal resources and environment impacts assessment. The main goal of the proposed research is to explore whether an integrated method is feasible to better understand the fundamental physics associated with a coupled floating tidal energy system through numerical framework with experimental comparisons and validations. This would then potentially provide more accurate industry design guidelines for the future commercialized FTCTs and other floating marine energy devices.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,EP/M020282/1,,,,,,,,University of Strathclyde,,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:15335765,,

High resolution capacity factors are estimated from a bottom-up estimation of global wind speeds calculated from several decades of wind speed data. A technology-rich description of fixed and floating foundation types allows the levelised cost of electricity to be calculated for 1 x 1 km grid cells, relative to location-specific annual energy production, and accounting for exclusion areas, array losses and turbine availability.

The measured wind speed from Directorate General of Civil Aviation, Kuwait for eight offshore stations during January 2012 to December 2015 was used and the parameters of Weibull distributions and wind power densities are estimated at an extrapolated elevation of 30-m from mean sea level. It is found that the best marine location was Beacon N6, just 3 km south of Boubiyan Island with wind power density of 583.2 W/m(2) during summer. It was found that the wind power density near the coastal area peak in summer, which is good, since in summer, the demand for energy is high. The next highest wind power density was at South Dolphin and Ahmadi oil pier area, which is also closer to mainland. The wind power density was also found to be high at offshore locations such as Sea Island Buoy, Umm Al-Maradim, and Beacon M28 during winter. In Kuwait, the wave climate is moderate and the water depths are less than 20 m for most of the sites. Economic analysis is carried for a 50 MW offshore wind mill and is compared with 800 MW thermal power plant. From this analysis, it is found that power production/kWh from offshore wind turbines will be about 30% cheaper compared to the oil based thermal power plant. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

Given the considerable growth of renewable energies and thus offshore wind farms in Germany over the last decade, increasing levels of aluminum, indium and zinc are released to the marine environment. Although these metals are ecotoxicologically well-studied, data regarding their impact on marine organisms, especially sediment-dwelling species, as well as possible ecotoxicological effects of galvanic anodes are scarce. To investigate possible ecotoxicological effects to the marine environment, the diatom Phaedactylum tricornutum, the bacterium Aliivibrio fischeri and the amphipod Corophium volutator were exposed to dissolved galvanic anodes and solutions of aluminum and zinc, respectively, in standardized laboratory tests using natural seawater. In addition to acute toxicological effects, the uptake of these elements by C. volutator was investigated. Results The investigated anode material caused no acute toxicity to the tested bacteria and only weak but significant effects on algal growth. In case of the amphipods, the single elements Al and Zn showed significant effects only at the highest tested concentrations. Moreover, an accumulation of Al and In was observed in the crustacea species. Conclusions Overall, the findings of this study indicated no direct environmental impact on the tested marine organisms by the use of galvanic anodes for cathodic protection.

Using multi-year water quality data collected before and after CREP implementation (1986, 2003-2006), we were unable to detect significant effects of CREP on baseflow nutrient concentrations based on the area of restored buffer, the percentage of restored streamside, or the percentage of total riparian buffer in the sub-basins (p > 0.05). Although CREP increased the average buffered streamside from 33% in the 1990s to 44% by 2005, N and P concentrations have not changed or have increased in some streams over the last 20 years. Reductions may not have occurred for the following reasons: (1) buffer age, width, and connectivity (gaps) between buffers are also important to nutrient reductions; (2) agricultural nutrient inputs may have increased during this period; and (3) riparian buffer restoration was not extensive enough by 2005 to have measurable affects on the stream water quality in these sub-basins.

An experimental campaign was carried out to characterise the hydrodynamic response of a 1:37.5 scale model of the WEC sub-system under regular and irregular waves. On the basis of the data from the experimental campaign, the hydrodynamic response of the WEC sub-system is characterised in four steps: (i) through an incident and reflected wave analysis (IRWA), to characterise the interaction between the device and the waves; (ii) through the capture width ratio, to study the performance of the device; (iii) through response amplitude operators (RAOs) of the free surface elevation and pneumatic pressure inside the OWC chamber, to study the effects of the incident waves on the device response; and (iv) through the wave run-up on the device.

Among the two variants of the OWT's, namely, fixed and floating configurations, the former can be considered as an optimal solution considering the trade-off between factors such as economics, proximity to land and efficiency. The motivation is to get a deeper understanding of the interaction of breaking focused waves with a bottom fixed vertical cylinder by performing lab experiments. In shallow waters, one of the primary factors governs the design of a fixed OWT substructure is hydrodynamic loads acting on it due to breaking waves. The main objective of the study is to investigate wave impact pressures on a monopile substructure subjected to breaking focused waves. Laboratory experiments are conducted in a 30m long, 2m wide and 1.8m deep wave flume, at Department of Ocean Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology Madras, India. The generation of breaking focused waves is accomplished by linear superposition of wave components. Following the simulation procedure, the desired signal to the wave maker was computed by combining 28 sinusoidal wave components within the frequency range from 0.42Hz to 1.10Hz. The cylinder model is made of acrylic material of 0.2m diameter, 0.005m thickness and length of 1.3m. The cylinder is placed at the center of 2m wide flume. The wave induced dynamic pressures were measured at eight different positions along the depth of the vertical cylinder for different intensities of plunging breaking waves by using pressure transducers.

Then, the seventh transducer and the eighth transducers are positioned at and below SWL. The top six pressure transducers are uniformly spaced at an interval of 0.04m and the last two transducers are spaced at an interval of 0.06m. The pressure measurements are recorded in the front of the cylinder in order to investigate the wave induced impact pressure on the monopile due to breaking focused wave.

The welfare measures derived from the RPNB model relate to the current beach users only, whereas those from the MPLN model refer to the general population of residents and tourists in Catalonia. The results show the importance of the specific place of location of the OWF project and how the installation of wind turbines would significantly decrease the demand for trips, depending on their degree of visual impacts, leading to a substantial welfare loss.

When waves are added to the turbulent tidal current, the resulting wave-current induced turbulence and its impact on a tidal turbine make the design problem truly challenging. Although some very interesting and useful field measurements of tidal turbulence have been obtained at several sites around the world, only limited measurements have been made where waves and tidal currents co-exist, such as in the PFOW. Also, as these measurements are made at those sites licensed to particular marine energy device developers, the data are not accessible to academic researchers or other device developers. Given the ongoing development of tidal stream power in the Pentland Firth, there is a pressing need for advanced in situ field measurements at locations in the vicinity of planned device deployments. Equally, controlled generation of waves, currents and turbulence in the laboratory, and measurement of the performance characteristics of a model-scale tidal turbine will aid in further understanding of wave-current interactions. Such measurements would provide a proper understanding of the combined effects of waves and misaligned tidal stream flows on tidal turbine performance, and the resulting cyclic loadings on individual devices and complete arrays. The availability of such measurements will reduce uncertainty in analysis (and hence risk) leading to increased reliability (and hence cost reductions) through the informed design of more optimised tidal turbine blades and rotor structures. An understanding of wave-current-structure interaction and how this affects the dynamic loading on the rotor, support structure, foundation, and other structural components is essential not only for the evaluation of power or performance, but also for the estimation of normal operational and extreme wave and current scenarios used to assess the survivability and economic viability of the technology, and to predict associated risks. The proposal aims to address these issues through laboratory and field measurements. This research will investigate the combined effect of tidal currents, gravity waves, and ambient flow turbulence on the dynamic response of tidal energy converters. A high quality database will be established comprising field-scale measurements from the Pentland Firth, Orkney waters, and Shetland region, supplemented by laboratory-scale measurements from Edinburgh University's FloWave wave-current facility. Controlled experiments will be carried out at Edinburgh University's FloWave facility to determine hydrodynamic loads on a tidal current device and hence parameterise wave-current-turbulence-induced fatigue loading on the turbine's rotor and foundation.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,EP/N021487/1,,,,,,,,University of Edinburgh,,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:15359581,,

We studied white-tailed eagle space use with a particular focus on the potential for annual power production (GWh) at specific locations, as estimated by the Finnish Wind Atlas. Also, we aimed to detect a potential human-wildlife conflict by assessing white-tailed eagle space use against the spatial distribution of existing and recently proposed wind farms. We found that, despite visiting a large proportion of the country, the eagles stayed primarily within coastal areas and islands, restricted to where human infrastructure was present only at very small amounts. Because of the distribution of wind resources, such areas were found to contain considerable potential for power production. The eagles visited most of the areas targeted for wind-energy development. However, these areas did not coincide with a higher-than-average eagle relocation frequency, suggesting that the existing and recently proposed wind farms do not represent an elevated threat to dispersing eagles.

This is because of high power consumption by factories and also due to less availability of conventional energy resources. Electricity is most needed facility for the human being. All the conventional energy resources are depleting day by day. So we have to shift from conventional to non-conventional energy resources. In this the combination of two energy resources is takes place i.e. wind and solar energy. This process reviles the sustainable energy resources without damaging the nature. We can give uninterrupted power by using hybrid energy system. Basically this system involves the integration of two energy system that will give continuous power. Solar panels are used for converting solar energy and wind turbines are used for converting wind energy into electricity. This electrical power can utilize for various purpose. Generation of electricity will be takes place at affordable cost. This paper deals with the generation of electricity by using two sources combine which leads to generate electricity with affordable cost without damaging the nature balance. The purpose of this project was to design a portable and low cost power system that combines both sea current electric turbine and solar electric technologies.

Any faulty converter is cutoff under traditional fault-tolerant control. When all parallel converters are faulty, the wind turbine must be shut down. Although simple, such a fault-tolerant control reduces system availability. Thus, a reconfigurable control for fault-tolerant of parallel wind power converters is proposed in this paper. The current reference of every phase leg in parallel converter system is reconfigured postfault according to their healthy states. The proposed reconfigurable control is realized in software level and without requiring redundant hardware. Compared with traditional fault-tolerant control, the proposed reconfigurable control only cuts off the faulty legs rather than faulty converter, and makes full use of all healthy legs. The reconfigurable control improves the availability of parallel wind power converters and provides multiple-leg fault ride-through capability to WECS, enhancing reliability and electricity generation.

North American hoary bats (Lasiurus cinereus cinereus) roost in trees year-round and probably migrate farther than any other bats, yet we still lack basic information about their migration patterns and wintering locations or strategies. This information is needed to better understand unprecedented fatality of hoary bats at wind turbines during autumn migration and to determine whether the species could be susceptible to an emerging disease affecting hibernating bats. Our aim was to infer probable seasonal movements of individual hoary bats to better understand their migration and seasonal distribution in North America. We analyzed the stable isotope values of non-exchangeable hydrogen in the keratin of bat hair and combined isotopic results with prior distributional information to derive relative probability density surfaces for the geographic origins of individuals. We then mapped probable directions and distances of seasonal movement. Results indicate that hoary bats summer across broad areas. In addition to assumed latitudinal migration, we uncovered evidence of longitudinal movement by hoary bats from inland summering grounds to coastal regions during autumn and winter. Coastal regions with nonfreezing temperatures may be important wintering areas for hoary bats. Hoary bats migrating through any particular area, such as a wind turbine facility in autumn, are likely to have originated from a broad expanse of summering grounds from which they have traveled in no recognizable order.

Thus, this study employed a process-based life cycle inventory (LCI) model to calculate the life-cycle energy and emissions of offshore wind power in China based on the country's first offshore wind energy project. Results showed that the life-cycle energy of the studied wind farm was 2.28E+09 MJ or 0.39 MJ/kwh, with emission intensities of 25.5 g CO2-eq/kWh for GHG, 0.02 g/kWh for PM2.5, 0.06 g/kWh for SO2 and 0.09 g/kWh for NOx. The life-cycle footprints are dominated by the manufacture of wind turbines and foundation materials production. Compared to onshore wind farms, offshore wind power plants usually have greater life-cycle electricity yields, but their levelized energy and environmental footprints are less favorable. The green manufacturing of China's steel sector, and scientific operation and maintenance programs of wind facilities contribute to greening offshore wind power.

However, wind farms may have negative impacts on birds.The East China Coast forms a key part of the East Asian-Australasian Flyway and it is a crucial region for wind energy development in China.However, despite ducks being the dominant animal taxon along the East China Coast in winter and considered as particularly vulnerable to the effects of wind farms, the potential negative impacts of wind farms on duck populations remain unclear. We therefore assessed the effects of wind farms on duck abundance, distribution, and habitat use at Chongming Dongtan, which is a major wintering site for ducks along the East Asian-Australasian Flyway, using field surveys and satellite tracking. We conducted seven paired field surveys of ducks inside (IWF) and outside wind farm (OWF) sites in artificial brackish marsh, paddy fields, and aquaculture ponds. Duck abundance was significantly higher in OWF compared with IWF sites, and significantly higher in artificial brackish marsh than in aquaculture ponds and paddy fields. Based on 1,918 high-resolution satellite tracking records, the main habitat types of ducks during the day and at night were artificial brackish marsh and paddy fields, respectively. Furthermore, grid-based analysis showed overlaps between ducks and wind farms, with greater overlap at night than during the day. According to resource selection functions, habitat use by wintering ducks was impacted by distance to water, land cover, human activity, and wind-farm effects, and the variables predicted to have significant impacts on duck habitat use differed between day and night. Our study suggests that wintering ducks tend to avoid wind turbines at Chongming Dongtan, and landscape of paddy fields and artificial wetlands adjoining natural wetlands is crucial for wintering ducks Copyright: CC0 1.0 Universal (CC0 1.0) Public Domain Dedication",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"East China Normal University, School of Life Science, China",East China Normal University,,,2020-11-17,DRCI:DATA2020229020470675,,

Type certification is applied to serial production such as wind turbines when the matching of the site characteristics and the turbine design conditions is summarised in a short description of the site parameters that fundamentally describes the wind conditions (energy and turbulence). This easy matching is used by all stakeholders in assessing the suitability of different turbines to a specific project development. However, type classification is also important to optimise the design, manufacturing, installation and maintenance costs by setting key parameters to production of turbines with same characteristics (scale factor).The same applies to tidal turbines. Although, at the present phase of development, serial production is not yet a main driver and designs are mainly carried out with specific sites in mind, it is useful to develop a type classification now to support generic design parameters and that can be tested for future serial production and matching sites with serial products.While for wind turbines, the set of key parameters is reasonably simple [1], for tidal there are a number of environmental conditions (for example waves, astronomical tide, current turbulence, water depth, etc), and parameters (such as hub height related to the seabed and sea surface) which must be considered within the design of a HATT, parameters which may also be utilised in the construction of generic type classes for Tidal Turbines.Thus, the identification of generic type classes for HATTs is dependent upon the ability (by conjunction of assumptions, formulations, etc.) to distil the existing extensive list of site / HATT parameters down to a minimum number of key parameters upon which a simple but robust set of generic type classes could be based.Whilst it is recognised that adjustments of type classes may be required in the future, a first approach will be presented in the DNV GL Standard for Certification of HATT developed under the ReDAPT project and it is described in detail in this paper.

The development of different design techniques and the economics of these systems have been reviewed in detail. The accurate wind forecasting methods, data collecting techniques and the need for site investigations have also been highlighted. Cost drivers differ offshore, with large projects of 50 MW+ and a premium on high reliability, efficient access and as much self-maintainability as possible. Designs need to be very well proven before being mass-installed offshore. Turbine technology therefore lags somewhere behind where it would optimally be, as the proving is done onshore. In the short term, technical innovation tends to focus on non-turbine aspects: support structure, foundations, installation and maintenance equipment and methods, and machine diagnosis and health check systems. However the pressure to reduce turbine cost continues unabated. In the future, improvements will come about naturally through more efficient procurement and production methods, but there are also clues as to the direction that designs will take. Onshore, noise sensitivities impose limits on what can be achieved, but offshore there is no such limit. Tip speeds therefore can be expected to rise. Direct drive generators removing the need for transmission gearboxes offer the prospect of simplicity and high reliability.

The scour process at the basis of the foundation and the wave run-up on the structure have been also taken into account.

It is widely accepted that mechanical interlocking is the dominant adhesion mechanism for most substrate-coating combinations. To prevent premature failure, minimum coating adhesion strength, surface preparation grades, and roughness parameters are often specified. For corrosion-protection coatings for offshore wind turbines, an adhesion strength ae 5 MPa is commonly assumed to ensure adhesion over service lifetime. In order to fulfill this requirement, Rz > 80 A mu m and a preparation grade of Sa3 are common specifications. In this study, the necessity of these requirements is investigated using the widely used combination of twin-wire arc-sprayed ZnAl15 on S355J2 + N as a test case. By using different blasting media and parameters, the correlation between coating adhesion and roughness parameters is analyzed. The adhesion strength of these systems is measured using a test method allowing measurements on real parts. The results are compared to DIN EN 582:1993, the European equivalent of ASTM-C633.

The focus of this paper is on research questions comprising future societal challenges for the local population. For this purpose, the focus-group discussion has proven to be a valuable participatory method. Concerning future development of wind energy in the Alps, regional value creation (including workplaces) and the placement of systems where man-made infrastructure is already present were the main visions mentioned by workshop participants.So far, wind energy as implemented in the valley of Goms has not been perceived as a topic of conflict by the local community.

In this work, the SRA of an OWT jacket-type support structure is conducted, applying two stochastic methods to predict the safety level of the structure considering various design constraints. The first method refers to a commercial finite element analysis (FEA) package (DesignXplorer (c) from ANSYS) which employs direct simulations and the six sigma analysis function applying Latin hypercube sampling (LHS) to predict the probability of failure. The second method develops a non-intrusive formulation which maps the response of the structure through a finite number of simulations to develop a response surface, and then employs first-order reliability methods (FORM) to evaluate the reliability index and, subsequently, the probability of failure. In this analysis, five design constraints were considered: stress, fatigue, deformation, buckling, and vibration. The two methods were applied to a baseline 10-MW OWT jacket-type support structure to identify critical components. The results revealed that, for the inherent stochastic conditions, the structural components can safely withstand such conditions, as the reliability index values were found acceptable when compared with allowable values from design standards. The reliability assessment results revealed that the fatigue performance is the design-driving criterion for structural components of OWT support structures. While there was good agreement in the safety index values predicted by both methods, a limitation of the direct simulation method is in its requirement for a prohibitively large number of simulations to estimate the very low probabilities of failure in the deformation and buckling constraint cases.

In connection with the Rhode Island ocean special area management plan, a technology development index was developed by Spaulding et al. (2010) to quantify the technical challenges of a particular site relative to its potential power production. A component of this index is the technology type (TT) factor, which quantifies the relative cost of a structure/foundation system as a function of environmental loading, water depth, and soil conditions. This paper presents the development of TT factors for jacket type support structures that is proposed for supporting the offshore wind turbines in Rhode Island Sound. TT factors were calculated by the total weight of the jacket and piles for a given water depth and soil conditions normalized by the weight of a reference structure. Jacket structure weights were determined by a frequency driven finite element analysis using the program ANSYS. The structure was subjected to hydrodynamic and quasi-static turbine loads from 50-year extreme wind and the 100-year extreme wave loading in Rhode Island Sound to determine the ultimate stresses in the structural members. Pile foundation weights were determined from an analysis of the axial capacity and the lateral capacity using commercially available pile design software. Jacket and foundation weights were calculated for water depth ranging from 30 m to 60 m and for three representative soil types. These analyses resulted in a Technology Type factor that varies with water depth according to a 2nd order polynomial, and also with soil type. The results were compared to the weights of two existing jacket structures in Europe and found to be in agreement with the upper bound estimate derived from this study. The Technology Type factor derived in this study was also in good agreement with the published actual cost (normalized) of jacket type foundations used in the United Kingdom.

The manufacturing cost was approached by means of manufacturing complexity factors, whose values were obtained through a survey among experts in floating offshore wind. Key finding of this work, under the defined conditions, is the fact that semi-sub structures with steel as structural material appeared to be the most expensive configuration, spar costs decrease with higher draft values, due to the reduction in the ballast mass, while the barge solution is potentially the lowest cost alternative.

During its long-term service, in addition to the static pretension load, the suction anchor is subjected to a series of cyclic loads that are caused by waves, currents and the continuous motions of the floating structure. Thus, excess pore-pressure will accumulate within the soil around the embedded anchor, and the anchor capacity tends to be reduced. In this paper, by introducing the oscillatory and residual mechanisms, a novel numerical model is proposed to predict the instantaneous variations and accumulations of excess pore-pressures around a suction anchor that is subjected to long-term vertical cyclic loads. The results indicate that excess pore-pressure builds up mainly in the shallow soil near the external anchor wall. As a consequence, the effective soil stress in this region decreases along with the interface friction between the external wall and the soil. Detailed parametric studies reveal that the accumulation of excess pore-pressure is obvious for a larger load magnitude and smaller load period. With a lower permeability, smaller shear modulus or smaller relative density of the seabed soil, the pore pressure accumulation outside the anchor increases significantly. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Following a values beliefs-norm framework, this survey measured respondents' underlying values, anticipated impacts of the proposed wind energy project, attachment to the island, and beliefs about the ocean. The results indicate that ocean beliefs and underlying values have direct and indirect associations with expectations and support for an offshore wind energy project development.

We measured bearing and altitude of nocturnal migrants, as well as the average number of migrants flying in the airspace closest to the wind turbines. Using weather data on wind direction and strength during the periods of monitored migration, we calculated flow-assistance of wind in aiding migration. Although there was greater flow-assistance to movement in spring over fall migration, we did not find a significant difference between the preoperational and operational periods in flow-assisted flight. The altitude at which migrants flew did differ with development phase of the wind facility; migrants flew at higher altitudes during years when the turbines were operational compared to preoperational years. Although the proportion of migrants detected in the airspace 0-150 m above ground level (ag1), coinciding with turbine height, did not differ with season or operational phase of the installation, there was a reduction in the proportion of migrants in the airspace just above turbines (151-300 m ag1) when turbines were operational. In general, though, the overall altitudes used by migrants were typically higher than turbine height, so the adjustments we documented would only further reduce what appear to be already low levels of collision risk at this particular facility.

The technical performance is assessed through computer simulations to analyze the electricity demand and the wind resource. End-users' acceptance is studied from in situ surveys and semi-structured interviews with all beneficiaries. Results show that the flat areas on the north coast have a low wind variability and high wind speeds, while in the mountainous areas the implementation of SWT is limited by the orography's impact on wind variability.

We investigate to which extent electricity autarky on different levels is possible in Europe, from the continental, to the national, regional, and municipal levels, assuming that electricity autarky is only possible when the technical potential of renewable electricity exceeds local demand. We determine the technical potential of roof-mounted and open field photovoltaics, as well as on- and offshore wind turbines through an analysis of surface eligibility, considering land cover, settlements, elevation, and protected areas as determinants of eligibility for renewable electricity generation. In line with previous analyses we find that the technical-social potential of renewable electricity is greater than demand on the European and national levels. For subnational autarky, the situation is different: here, demand exceeds potential in several regions, an effect that is stronger the higher population density is. To reach electricity autarky below the national level, regions would need to use very large fractions or all of their non-built-up land for renewable electricity generation. Subnational autarky requires electricity generation to be in close proximity to demand and thus increases the pressure on non-built-up land especially in densely populated dense regions where pressure is already high. Our findings show that electricity autarky below the national level is often not possible in densely populated areas in Europe.",,,,,Conference on Energy Modelling Platform for Europe (EMP-E) - Modelling Clean Energy PathwaysConference on Energy Modelling Platform for Europe (EMP-E) - Modelling Clean Energy Pathways,"SEP 25-26, 2018SEP 25-26, 2018",,"Brussels, BELGIUMBrussels, BELGIUM",56,0,0,0,4,0,55,,,2211-467X,2211-4688,,,,,,,,,,"Inst Adv Sustainabil Studies, Berliner Str 130, D-14467 Potsdam, GermanySwiss Fed Inst Technol, Inst Environm Decis, Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Univ Str 16, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland",Inst Adv Sustainabil Studies,,,2020-01-07,WOS:000504054700023,,

Additionally, BFJNP has 230 ha (2.6%) of a relict fog forest. This unique combination of vegetation formations, partly explains the high plant species richness of the park. We discuss the climatic and topo-edaphic factors associated with each type of vegetation formation.Compared to BFJNP, the surrounding vegetation matrix shows evidence of changes in both the dominant vegetation and their plant covers; moreover, it is floristically depauperate relative to the park. This territory also includes agricultural land and plantations of non-native shrubs, as well as goat herding and small, inter-dispersed human settlements. Its main land cover types are: scrub (50%), scrub with succulents (34%), agricultural land (8%), secondary prairies (3.5%), and plantations of non-native shrubs (1.6%). Approximately 22% of this area presents high levels of anthropization. Additionally, two wind farms (217 wind turbines) have begun operating within the vicinity of BFJNP within the past two years.BFJNP provides more than a mere representative sample of the current vegetation; it constitutes a remnant of the natural vegetation that once dominated the Coastal Desert before European colonization. Whereas the relict fog forest has been historically isolated, the desert vegetation is increasingly losing connectivity outside the park. We discuss the consequences of this isolation in terms of long-term maintenance of biodiversity. We argue that plant communities at BFJNP are the best available model for ecological restoration projects in this region of Chile. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

To bridge the gap between load demand and generation of electricity, the wind power is a cheapest indigenous solution.Wind power these days is gaining popularity as a growing renewable energy source in the world because of its environmentally clean and safe usage. For generation of wind power, the trend is to install large wind farms either onshore or offshore. These wind farms consist of a large number of wind turbines. Onshore wind farms cover large areas of land but an interesting option is to build offshore wind farms because of higher average wind speeds at sea.In wind power generation, power electronics converters are widely used because of their manifold advantage. DC DC topologies are most commonly used in wind farms because of their high efficiency and compact size. A single-active bridge (SAB) converter being simple in topology has recently drawn attraction of many researchers. Such converter despite its simple design and number of attractive features produces oscillations. Therefore, it is imperative to design an appropriate controller to minimize the oscillations.

It holds important populations of wintering waders including purple sandpiper, turnstone, ringed plover and bar-tailed godwit. The waders on Sanday have been periodically surveyed since 1982. In November 2012 the waders using the SPA were re-surveyed. There were three objectives to this work: 1. To undertake co-ordinated wader surveys (repeat counts of the relevant wader survey sections) to inform Site Condition Monitoring. 2. To record general observations of wader movements during the day in relation to existing domestic scale wind turbines on Sanday. Note - the wind turbines being considered are domestic scale generally associated with individual farms and dwellings. 3. To recommend a future monitoring strategy for waders using East Sanday Coast SPA. Main findings Wader Counts A total of 7,279 waders of 17 species were counted within the SPA boundary in late November 2012; The counts were lower than the previous surveys for purple sandpiper, turnstone, ringed plover and sanderling; Bar-tailed godwit counts were higher than previous surveys; and Differences in the timing of the count from previous surveys may account for the observed changes. General Observations of waders General observations of waders revealed that most species used the farmland; Curlew, golden plover, lapwing, snipe and redshank used farmland more frequently than other birds; and The narrower sections of the islands were often used as crossing points for waders moving from one beach to another. Recommendations for future monitoring of waders using East Sanday Coast SPA At least three counts should be undertaken using existing count boundaries and methodologies in the late winter; Each total count should be undertaken over as short a period as possible to minimise double counting; Long count sections and a team of observers should be used; Consideration should be given to undertaking spring and autumn passage counts; To further our understanding of how waders use farmland on Sanday, structured monitoring should be undertaken. This monitoring should ideally include observing how waders use farmland during the different stages of the tide and day and night; and Studies on the food availability may help to inform our understanding of wader distributions on Sanday.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,1759-4014,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2014-01-01,ZOOREC:ZOOR15311071220,,

The ground acceleration term is represented by a simple cosine function to investigate both normal and parallel components of the earthquake motions located near ground surface. The function of earthquake force is simplified to apply Rayleigh's energy method. Wind forces acting on above the water level and wave forces acting on below this level are utilized in computations considering earthquake effect for entire structure. The wind force is divided into two groups: the force acting on the tower and the forces acting on the rotor nacelle assembly (RNA). The drag and the inertial wave forces are calculated with water particle velocities and accelerations due to linear wave theory. The resulting hydrodynamic wave force on the tower in an unsteady viscous flow is determined using the Morison equation. The displacement function of the physical system in which dynamic analysis is performed by Rayleigh's energy method is obtained by the single degree of freedom (SDOF) model. The equation of motion is solved by the fourth-order Runge-Kutta method. The two-way FSI (fluid-structure interaction) technique was used to determine the accuracy of the numerical analysis. The results of computational fluid dynamics and structural mechanics are coupled in FSI analysis by using ANSYS software. Time-varying lateral displacements and the first natural frequency values which are obtained from Rayleigh's energy method and FSI technique are compared. The results are presented by graphs. It is observed from these graphs that the Rayleigh model can be an alternative way at the prelimanary stage of the structural analysis with acceptable accuracy.,,,,,,,,,13,0,0,0,0,0,13,,,1687-8086,1687-8094,,,,,,,,,,"Manisa Celal Bayar Univ, Dept Civil Engn, Manisa, Turkey",,,,2018-05-11,WOS:000431231200001,,

Two goals addressed are the extraction of modal parameters for model validation and the estimation of condition parameters to allow a hypothesis of the system's state.In a first step the largedatabase is classified by Environmental and Operational Conditions (EOCs) through affinity propagation which is a new approach for Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) on wind turbines. Further, system identification through data driven stochastic subspace identification (SSI) is performed. A new, automated approach called triangulation-based extraction of modal parapeters (TEMP), using stability diagrams, is a key focus of the presented research. Finally, extraction of condition parameters for tower accelerations classified by EOCs, based on covariance driven SSI and Vector Auto-Regressive (VAR) Models, is performed for several observation periods from one to 16 weeks.

Case studies are presented to show the application of the methodology. The numerical model of the dynamic HLV-MP system includes the coupling between HLV and MP via a gripper device, and soil-MP interaction at different MP penetration depths.

This control algorithm has been formulated based on the symmetrical components in positive and negative rotating synchronous reference frames under generalized unbalanced operating conditions. Negative sequential component of ac input current is injected to the point of common coupling in the proposed control strategy. The amplitude of negative sequential component is calculated to minimize the negative sequential component of grid voltage at PCC under the limitation of current capability in a voltage source converter.

Their remote location, coupled with weather's constraints and harsh marine environment, and the lack of adapted access equipment, make their maintenance complicated and expensive due to high repair costs, high transportations costs and painful production losses due to high downtime.More generally, the offshore wind technology is in a stage of development where its economic worthiness has still to be fully demonstrated, and numerous projects are largely supported by governmental subsidies [1]. This lack of maturity is evident, for example, through the numerous reliability problems of wind turbines components.Both the inherent aspects of the offshore wind industry and the reliability problems it is facing contribute to the high Operation and Maintenance (O&M) costs and eventually hinder its competitiveness compared to other sources of energy. It is commonly assumed that up to 25 % of the cost of energy produced by offshore wind turbines is due to O&M activities, which is twice as expensive as onshore installations [2].This paper describes a methodology to optimize the maintenance strategy of offshore wind farms in order to minimize life cycle costs and maximize availability and performance. The ApmOptimizer, developed by BQR Reliability Engineering [3] is the software tool used for modelling, reliability analysis, cost and performance estimations and maintenance optimization.For the purpose of the demonstration, a case study of a typical wind farm is defined. A detailed model is built that accounts for numerous operational, cost and maintenance parameters. The ApmOptimizer optimization modules are then implemented for optimizing the preventive maintenance, periodical inspections, condition-based maintenance, and spares levels. Starting from a baseline scenario, several optimization steps are investigated, following a typical RAM/LCC analysis assessment procedure: Operational Availability, Operational Downtime, Lifecycle O&M Costs and produced Energy are used as the main metrics. The optimal maintenance strategy is obtained from an exact optimization process and not from Monte Carlo simulations that can provide only an approximate assessment for a user-inputted strategy.The study shows that by following several optimization steps, the wind farm performances can be significantly increased, to a level that makes the cost of produced energy more competitive.

Literature review indicates increasing worldwide investment in offshore renewable energy in recent years. Offshore energy shows a high potential as an alternative energy generation solution to that of fossil fuels. Using the capacities of wind and tidal power in renewable technologies would be a suitable alternative for fossil fuels and would help prevent their detrimental effects on the environment. It is a cost-effective procedure for the power generation sector to maximize these renewables as a hybrid system. At the design phase, turbine types appropriate to environmental conditions for an area with high wind speed and tidal flow need to be considered. When selecting which turbines should be used, horizontal or vertical axis, number and length of blades, and optimized rotational speed are all important to get maximum capacity from either the wind or tidal energy for the hybrid system. Comprehensive simulation models of the hybrid system are now being set up, using several available commercial software packages such as QBlade, Simulink, and RETScreen. Several different parameters will be required for these simulation models to run in order to test performance, capacity and efficiency of the proposed hybrid system. To decide which regions are suitable for the hybrid system, it will be necessary to analyze available wind and tide records from NIWA, and online databases such as GLOBAL ATLAS. This next phase of research will aim to create optimized scenarios for the hybrid model by considering the effect of wind and water speed on performance. After deciding which region and scenarios are suitable, it will also be necessary to evaluate the costs and returns of a hybrid system.

With continuing the development of renewable energy, the photovoltaic, wind turbine generator and battery energy storage system are integrated into stand-alone microgrid that reduces generation cost, mitigates environment emission and increases generation efficiency. To determine the complicated optimization problem, a combination of Monte Carlo simulation and charged system search algorithm is used in this paper. The proposed scheme comprises both the inner loop to determine the hourly schedule of distributed energy resources and outer loop to optimize the capacity of distributed energy resources in life cycle.

The most common foundation type of a wind turbine is a monopile, upon which the wind tower rests. The pile is driven into place with the help of hydraulic hammers. During the hammering of the pile, high levels of noise are generated which are known to produce deleterious effects on both mammals and fish. In this work, a linear semi-analytical model is developed for predicting the levels of underwater noise for a wide range of system parameters. The model incorporates all major parts of the system. The hydraulic hammer is substituted by an external force, the pile is described as a thin circular cylindrical shell, the water is modelled as a compressible fluid and the water-saturated seabed is defined by distributed springs and dashpots in all directions. The solution of the coupled vibroacoustic problem is based on the representation of the response of the complete system on the modal basis of the in vacua shell structure. The influence that the inter-modal coupling, the choice of the soil parameters and the acoustic impedance of the seabed have on the generated noise levels is studied in the frequency domain. Strong and weak points of the present model are discussed on the basis of a comparison with a set of available experimental data. The obtained results show the capability of the model to predict the underwater noise levels both qualitatively and quantitatively. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

For this purpose, a coastal city was selected from each Iranian coastal province, and then the wind energy generation potential in these cities was evaluated by Weibull distribution function. The amount of energy to be generated by three commercially available wind turbines and the amount of desalinated water and hydrogen to be produced in each area were then evaluated. The results showed that the port of Anzali on the coast of the Caspian Sea has an average annual wind power density of 327 w/m(2), and thus enjoys the best wind energy generation potential among the studied coastal areas. The annual energy generation to be achieved by one EWT direct wind 52/900 turbine installed in this port was found to be 2315.53MWh, which is equivalent to 1804 tons of net annual CO2 emission reduction. The total energy output of the said turbine could be used to produce 439,950.7m(3) of treated water or 35,973.49 kg of hydrogen a year.

Rotor-based marine and hydrokinetic (MHK) turbines generate electricity from river, tidal, and other water currents, operating analogously to wind turbines in air. An MHK rotor designer can draw upon a vast body of general purpose and wind power specific airfoils, but application specific hydrofoils can more optimally meet the needs of MHK power. We present the MHKF1 family of hydrofoils, designed upon experience drawn from wind turbine airfoils and incorporating hydro-specific considerations. The MHKF1 hydrofoils were developed to balance the following design objectives: (1) basic hydrodynamic performance with lift to drag ratio (l/d) as a key metric, (2) limited sensitivity to soiling because of biofouling concerns and the high cost of maintenance in the marine environment, (3) sufficient thickness for structural efficiency, (4) good stall characteristics, (5) hydrodynamic and geometric compatibility such that the different hydrofoils of the family can be applied on the same rotor blade, (6) low susceptibility to cavitation, and (7) low susceptibility to singing. While the first five criteria are common to wind turbine airfoil design, the last two are specific to operation in water. Cavitation, the formation of bubbles within a fluid, can have numerous detrimental effects including erosion of impinged surfaces, degraded performance, vibration, and noise. The minimum surface pressure of the MHKF1 hydrofoils were managed to reduce the likelihood of cavitation. Singing, a hydroacoustic/hydroelastic phenomenon of the trailing edge of hydrofoils, results in noise and vibration. To suppress singing, trailing edge thicknesses were increased and hydrofoil variants were designed with anti-singing profiles. The MHKF1 hydrofoils were developed with a combination of inverse and direct design methods using XFOIL and various routines for parameterizing hydrofoil geometries and surface velocity distributions.

The UK is fortunate in having substantial potential for generating renewable power offshore. Tidal power has the unique advantage amongst renewables technologies of being completely predictable and is thus a particularly valuable component of any renewable energy portfolio. Tidal stream turbines are site in tidal rapid areas. These are rather small and unusual habitats which have comparatively little studied. One of the main environmental concerns with the use of tidal stream generators is that large animals such as marine mammals will be in collision with the rotating blades and suffer injury or even death. All cetaceans are European Protected Species.To assess collision risk we need to know the probability that animals will be in the vicinity of rotating turbine blades. This is a function of both the two dimensional spatial density distribution of animals and their distribution with depth. This information is currently lacking at all UK tidal rapid sites. This lack of knowledge introduces both environmental and economic risks. Planning consent applications are being delayed, onerous and costly mitigation measures may be placed on developers and development may initially be allowed only on a deploy and monitor basis which carries the risk for developers that devices may have to be removed if collisions do indeed occur. There are well developed methods to determine the two dimensional distribution and density of cetaceans. However, we believe the only practical technique to measure dive depth and underwater behaviour in these challenging habitats it so use drifting vertically oriented arrays of hydrophones to locate vocalising animals by time of arrival difference techniques. It was this conviction that led us to start working to develop such systems, and the software to analyse the data they produce, in 2009. Since then we've developed and thoroughly tested a system which is deployed from a drifting vessel. Field tests have shown that the system provides reliable and accurate locations and that animal vocalisation can be linked into tracks to reveal underwater movements and we are building a significant dataset of new information on porpoise underwater behaviour at putative tidal sites, mostly in Scotland.To be widely useful to industry however, the system needs to be sufficiently straight forward for industry and their consultants to deploy routinely. We've largely achieved this with the software by incorporating it into PAMGUARD, a feely available open sources cetacean detection, localisation and tracking package. However, the hardware is somewhat cumbersome, reflecting its origins as a research and development system. We are confident that recent technological developments provide several options for developing an affordable, self contained autonomous buoy-based system that can be hand deployed from a small boat e.g. a Rhib and the operate autonomously. This should be straight forward for non-specialist teams to utilise in the field and because a much smaller vessel is required field costs should be substantially reduced. We've also identified hydrophones as an area where we can provide knowledge to allow substantial cost savings.This proposal aims to take the knowledge and IP from the existing system and repackage it in a less expensive and more easily used buoy based system and make this, along with customised software, freely available as an open source resource.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,NE/L002795/1,,,,,,,,University of St Andrews,,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:15320592,,

A combination of fixed-station sampling, an axial abundance survey, and environmental monitoring data was used to determine how wind, currents, time of day, physics, developmental stage, and prey and predator abundances interacted to affect the distribution and potential transport of eggs and larvae. Wind-forced circulation patterns altered the depth-specific physical conditions at a fixed station and significantly influenced organism distributions and potential transport. The pycnocline was an important physical feature that structured the depth distribution of the planktonic community: most bay anchovy early-life stages (77%), ctenophores (72%), copepod nauplii (> 76%), and Acartia tonsa copepodites (69%) occurred above it. In contrast, 90% of sciaenid eggs, tentatively weakfish (Cynoscion regalis), were found below the pyenocline in waters where dissolved oxygen concentrations were < 2.0 mg l(-1). The day-night cycle also influenced organism abundances and distributions. Observed diel periodicity in concentrations of bay anchovy and sciaenid eggs, and of bay anchovy larvae > 6 mm, probably were consequences of nighttime spawning (eggs) and net evasion during the day (larvae). Diel periodicity in bay anchovy swimbladder inflation also was observed, indicating that larvae apparently migrate to surface waters at dusk to fill their swimbladders. Overall results suggest that wind-forced circulation patterns, below-pycnocline dissolved oxygen conditions, and diel changes in vertical distribution of larvae and their copepod prey have important implications for potential transport of bay anchovy early-life stages.

The footing is composed of steel plates and stiffeners forming compartments, backfilled to increase the vertical load. A special pile-footing connection is outlined, allowing transfer of lateral loads and moments, but not of vertical loads. The efficiency of the hybrid foundation is explored through 3D finite element modelling. Hybrid foundations of L=15 m are comparatively assessed to an L=30 m reference monopile. A detailed comparison is performed focusing on a 3.5 MW OWT. While the moment capacity of the monopile is larger, the hybrid foundation exhibits stiffer response, outperforming the monopile in the operational loading range. Under cyclic loading, the hybrid foundation experiences less stiffness degradation and rotation accumulation. Besides installation, the cost savings depend on the design of the footing and buckling can be crucial. The rubble fill is shown to provide lateral restraint to the stiffeners, being beneficial for buckling prevention. Although seismic shaking is not critical in terms of capacity, it may lead to substantial accumulation of rotation and settlement. Combined with cyclic environmental loading, the latter may challenge the serviceability of the OWT, potentially leading to a reduction of its service life. To derive insights on the effect of seismic loading, two scenarios are investigated: (a) seismic loading; and (b) combined environmental and seismic loading. In the first case, even a D=15 m hybrid foundation may outperform the reference monopile. This is not the case for combined environmental and seismic loading, where a D=20 m hybrid system would be required to outperform the reference monopile. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

For comparison purposes, the wind power plant is investigated for two Moroccan coastal zones with substantially different outdoor meteorological conditions. The three-bladed horizontal axis commercialized wind turbine Enercon-48 with a rated power of 800 kW is considered in the analysis. The developed computation tool can predict hourly energy/exergy flows and efficiencies of wind power generation at any location. The Levelized Cost of Electricity and its sensitivity to key financial and operational parameters was investigated as well. A geometrical technique applied to wind power generation was for the first time established to determine the combination of meteorological variables leading to the best compromise between energy efficiency maximization and exergy destruction minimization.

Understanding how weather conditions influence passage rates can help determine the potential for increased avian-turbine collisions. Using vertical and horizontal mounted marine radars, raptor stand watch observations, and portable handheld weather stations, we studied how temperature, cloud cover, barometric pressure, wind direction, and wind speed affected avian passage rates and height of migrants over 3 ridges (Wartenbe, North Dokie, and South Dokie) being developed for wind energy in northern British Columbia. Using an Akaike's Information Criterion (AIC), we determined that a reduced model combining wind speed, barometric pressure, and cloud cover was best at explaining and predicting higher passage rates (expressed as no. birds/hr) in the fall migration for both diurnal and nocturnal migrants. Wind speed proved the most important predictor of passage rates for spring nocturnal migrants and a combination of cloud cover, temperature, and wind direction for diurnal spring migrants. Wind speed also predicted decreases in flight altitude among nocturnal migrants but increased altitude in diurnal migrants. This information coupled with migration timing and topographical areas of higher migrant activity can be useful to wind energy proponents who wish to mitigate collision risk with migrating birds.

Secondary structures applied to the primary structure, as the transition piece of a monopole, can be e.g. cable support, boat landing or anode systems. These structures are often welded, which leads to problematic notch effects and hydrogen embrittlement, especially for underwater applications. Also the handling of technical equipment as power current or artificial housings for scuba divers for underwater welding is challenging. Adhesive bonding will lead to cost reduction as the mentioned negative aspects can be avoided. The corrosion protection coating and the primary structure will no longer be damaged and therefore do not need a subsequent coating. This article focuses on the area which is permanently exposed to water. A critical point is how the capability to form adhesion and cohesion, will be influenced by the application process under water. Therefore, stud bonding fasteners are designed that enable the injection of adhesive to the bonding area under water.

Numerical analysis is conducted using an in-house developed, effective stress-based, three-dimensional finite element code. The mechanical behaviors of the seabed are simulated by a kinematic hardening constitutive model that can describe the cyclic mobility of soils. Comparing the results of the seabed around a pile and the seabed with no pile foundation shows that the excess pore pressures accumulate faster when both of the effects are considered. Water depth plays an essential role in determining whether the effect of pile-soil interaction on excess pore pressures can be neglected.

In addition, blockage of pipelines by formation and accumulation of clathrate hydrates of natural gases has safety and economical concerns in oil and gas operations, particularly at high pressures and low temperatures such as those found in subsea or arctic environments. Practical adoption of icephobic/hydrate-phobic surfaces requires mechanical robustness and stability under harsh environments. Here, we develop durable and mechanically robust bilayer poly-divinylbenzene (pDVB)/poly-perfluorodecylacrylate (pPFDA) coatings using initiated chemical vapor deposition (iCVD) to reduce the adhesion strength of ice/hydrates to underlying substrates (silicon and steel). Utilizing a highly-cross-linked polymer (pDVB) underneath a very thin veneer of fluorine-rich polymer (pPFDA) we have designed inherently rough bilayer polymer films that can be deposited on rough steel substrates resulting in surfaces which exhibit a receding water contact angle (WCA) higher than 1501 and WCA hysteresis as low as 41. Optical profilometer measurements were performed on the films and root mean square (RMS) roughness values of R-q = 178.0 +/- 17.5 nm and R-q = 312.7 +/- 23.5 nm were obtained on silicon and steel substrates, respectively. When steel surfaces are coated with these smooth hard iCVD bilayer polymer films, the strength of ice adhesion is reduced from 1010 +/- 95 kPa to 180 +/- 85 kPa. The adhesion strength of the cyclopentane (CyC5) hydrate is also reduced from 220 +/- 45 kPa on rough steel substrates to 34 +/- 12 kPa on the polymer-coated steel substrates. The durability of these bilayer polymer coated icephobic and hydrate-phobic substrates is confirmed by sand erosion tests and examination of multiple ice/hydrate adhesion/de-adhesion cycles.",,,,,,,,,38,0,0,0,4,0,43,,,1744-683X,1744-6848,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Toledo, Dept Mech Ind & Mfg Engn, 2801 W Bancroft St, Toledo, OH 43606 USAUniv Tulsa, Dept Mech Engn, Tulsa, OK 74104 USAMIT, Dept Mech Engn, Cambridge, MA 02139 USAMIT, Dept Chem Engn, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA",,,,2018-12-28,WOS:000432205300002,29547674,

Design of such a structure may therefore benefit from consideration of the directional characteristics of loading. This paper focuses on a rational and efficient approach to assess the structural safety of jacket type OWTs under directionally dependent extreme environmental loads. The Incremental Wind-Wave Analysis (IWWA) framework is reviewed and used to assess capacity of jacket-type OWTs under directional environmental wind-wave conditions. The approach uses static pushover analysis of OWT jackets subject to combined wind and wave load patterns corresponding to increasing mean return periods (MRPs). The wind and wave conditions are calculated independently and assumed to occur simultaneously. The loading direction and jacket orientation are both included in the analysis. To illustrate the approach, metocean conditions at different sites along the U.S. Atlantic coast are obtained from the historical database of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Data Buoy Center. Two models are introduced for estimating the occurrence probability of wave direction, one of which directly uses the frequency of wave directions and the other uses a Gaussian kernel to represent the range of wave directions represented by given directional spectra. For each combination of wind-wave direction and structural orientation, an IWWA analysis gives the capacity in terms of the MRP conditions leading to formation of a fully developed plastic mechanism in the jacket. Those capacities, convolved with MRP models for loading intensity, yield direction-dependent structural reliabilities, and when those reliabilities are convolved with the probability density function for load direction, a total failure probability is obtained that accounts for wave directionality. Example analyses are conducted for an OWT supported by a four-leg jacket adapted from a design published as part of the European Union UpWind Project. Effects of extreme load directionality, structural orientation, structural geometry and site specification on the ultimate capacity of the jacket are carefully discussed. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Decisions on the operational management may concern the number of inspections or maintenance strategies which may allow full utilization of structural capacity or sacrifice residual life in order to avoid an unscheduled intervention. Design of such assets is often governed by design standards which offer the designer the flexibility to take certain decisions that may affect the CAPEX to OPEX ratio such as that of building a more robust structure which may eliminate the need for costly inspection operations. This paper is investigating this approach, taking the example of offshore wind turbine support structures as the reference case, and examines the relevant provisions of the DNV-Os-J101 Standard with respect to the design implications that such a decision may have to the overall life-cycle cost of the structure. Assessment of the structural properties under different design conditions is evaluated through a combination of detailed cost model and an iterative optimization algorithm.

Current performance-based assessment methods for OWTs often neglect structural failure and focus on equipment failure only, which can be assessed using existing empirical databases. This study uses a simulation-based approach to assess various performance metrics associated with offshore wind infrastructure exposed to operational wind and wave conditions. Surrogate modelling is used to predict structural failure due to fatigue in a computationally efficient manner. The proposed surrogate model is based on Gaussian process regression and allows one to run structural simulations at a small training sample of wind and wave conditions and emulates the response at combinations where the OWT was not explicitly assessed. This results in an integrated probabilistic performance-based assessment framework for OWTs that considers both structural and non-structural (equipment) components. In particular, the proposed framework is used to evaluate the potential impact of climate-change scenarios on various OWT performance metrics, namely, fatigue damage, fatigue reliability and, ultimately, financial losses (cost of direct damage) for a case study OWT. This is compared to the change in revenue resulting from power production to understand which is more sensitive to climate change. Both fatigue damage and structural safety are found to be sensitive to changes in the site environmental conditions. However, as financial losses additionally depend on non-structural components - which are typically characterised by much higher failure rates - they are found to be less sensitive to the considered climate-change scenarios.",,,,,,,,,3,0,0,0,1,0,3,,,1364-0321,1879-0690,,,,,,,,,,"UCL, Dept Civil Environm & Geomat Engn, London, EnglandScuola Univ Super IUSS Pavia, Pavia, Italy",,,,2020-11-17,WOS:000582927200058,,

In the repowering optimization strategy, the wind turbine foundations are not dismantled immediately after their service lifetime, and the lifecycle of them is extended to two generations' service time.

In consideration of climate and electricity tariff, the technical, economic and environmental performances of three types of the community-level grid-connected renewable power prototypes are compared by a full-year simulation, including basic photovoltaic power system, wind turbine system and biogas power system. Then, a comprehensive evaluation index is developed to evaluate the energy systems potential, which integrates all the technical, economic and environmental performance indicators. The advantages and disadvantages of renewable power system development in different regions were analyzed, to provide reference for China's green development and policy-making.It is found that biogas power system has comprehensive advantages in costs and electricity production for most cities,as the comprehensive evaluation index of BG in most cities is higher than that of PV and WT. In contrast, photovoltaic power system is not an economic option for the majority of cities, except several cities where are rich in solar energy resources, such as Lhasa and Sanya.The comprehensive evaluation index of the photovoltaic system in Lhasa is 0.45, which is only lower than the wind power system in Shanghai among the 60 systems. In the southeast coastal cities with high average annual wind speed, such as Shanghai and Shenzhen, the wind power system has great potential for development. The comprehensive evaluation index of Shanghai wind power system is 0.489, which is the highest. The sensitivity analysis included in this study shows that the local grid purchase tariffs have greater impacts on systems lifetime costs than feed-in tariffs.The reduction of local grid purchase tariffs and the increase of feed-in tariffs are beneficial to the development of renewable power system.",,,,,,,,,26,1,0,0,2,0,26,,,0196-8904,1879-2227,,,,,,,,,,"Cent S Univ, Sch Energy Sci & Engn, Energy Bldg, Changsha 410083, Hunan, Peoples R China",,,,2019-09-30,WOS:000484881400032,,

According to the installation sites, the wind energy conversion system can be divided into land-based wind conversion system and offshore wind energy conversion (OWEC) system. Compared to land-based wind energy technology, although OWEC started later, it has attracted more attentions due to its significant advantages in sufficient wind energy, low wind shear, high power output and low land occupancy rate. In this paper, the principle of wind energy conversion and the development status of offshore wind power in the world are briefly introduced at first. And then, the advantages and disadvantages of several offshore wind energy device (OWED), such as horizontal axis OWED, vertical axis OWED and cross axis OWED are compared. Subsequently, several major constraints, such as complex marine environment, deep-sea power transmission and expensive cost of equipment installation faced by offshore wind conversion technology are presented and comprehensively analysed. Finally, based on the summary and analysis of some emerging technologies and the current situation of offshore wind energy utilization, the development trend of offshore wind power is envisioned.

In this paper, the integration of an oscillating water column(OWC) into a vertical tubular structure is considered. The OWC chamber is enclosed by the tubular-structure with its submerged side partially open to the sea. As ocean waves propagate through the device, an air turbine installed at the top of the chamber can be driven to extract wave power. An analytical model based on potential flow theory and the eigen-function matching method is developed to solve the wave scattering and radiation problems of the device in finite water depths. Wave excitation volume flux, hydrodynamic coefficients, optimal turbine damping and power capture factor are evaluated. Upon successful validation, the model is applied to investigate the effect of the radius and finite wall thickness of the tubular-structure, the size and position of the opening on wave power extraction. We find that a thinner chamber wall thickness offers benefits to wave power extraction in terms of a broader primary band of power capture factor response, and that a broader and higher capture factor band can be achieved by increasing the height of the vertical opening.

In this context, the focus of this research is the investigation of the most effective approach to installing offshore wind farms at sea, including the effects of weather conditions. This target is achieved through the implementation of a discrete-event simulation approach which includes the analysis of the environmental conditions, distance matrix, vessel characteristics, and assembly scenarios.

The software is developed in the frequency domain, as a preprocessor of computing the wave excitation force, the added mass, and the wave radiation damping, for the input to a time-domain solver via the Fourier cosine and sine transforms. In addition, it can also predict the motion responses of a marine structure with sufficient accuracy, with or without the presence of a mooring system. Unlike other frequency-domain software, such as WAMITA (R) and HydrostarA (R), the present software currently employs the least squares method in association with a partially extended boundary integral equation method to remove the so-called irregular frequencies. Calculation of the free-surface Green's function employs a combination of fast-convergent series expansions in different parametric sub-regions. The solution of the resultant linear algebraic system employs the lower-upper (LU) decomposition method. Symmetry properties can be exploited, and the open multi-processing (OpenMP) parallelization technique can be applied to reduce the computation burden. The accuracy and the efficiency of the developed software are finally confirmed by numerical validations on three benchmark cases of a floating ellipsoid, a truncated circular cylinder and the OC4 DeepCwind semisubmersible floating wind turbine.

According to the results, the wind characteristics including wind speed and wind direction in mountainous regions are affected significant by topography. Wind speed is season-dependent, while the mean wind direction is not. The maximum wind speed occurs in spring, the minimum wind speed occurs in summer. As for extreme value distribution, the wind data in mountainous areas are more in line with Frechet distribution type. By using Weibull distribution function, Weibull parameters are calculated and energy potential are estimated with five methods. Estimation methods suitable for coastal areas can also be used for energy assessment in mountain environments. The maximum wind power density is over 200 W/m(2), occurred in Zanli site, while the minimum value is less than 10 W/m(2) in Yimen-A. Similar to mean wind characteristics, wind power density shows strong seasonality, with the maximum value in spring and the lowest value in summer.

In previous SAMP related work, the authors had considered the wind farm siting issue as an optimization problem between wind resources and technological constraints. In the present analysis, the additional constraints on wind farm siting of ecosystem services cost, in particular ecological and social services, are explored in an ecosystem-based management (EBM) conceptual framework. An ecological typology of the coastal area is developed on the basis of ecological variables, using spatial multivariate principal component and cluster analyses. Then, the sensitivity of the resulting ecological subregions to wind farm impact is assessed through the construction of ecological services impact indexes. A fishery service index is used to assess the fisheries services constraints. Ecosystem services constraints are combined with the technological cost and the wind resources to provide a wind farm siting index (WiFSI), which can be used as a tool to identify optimal areas for wind farm siting. In the paper, the authors develop the conceptual approach and present its application to the SAMP area as a case study. The technological cost is based on wind turbines with lattice jacket support structures, as currently proposed in Rhode Island waters, and the WiFSI method is used to identify optimal potential wind farm sites in coastal and offshore Rhode Island waters.

Three steps constitute our method. First, we map the available area, delimiting bathymetric areas based on turbine tower technology, then assess competing uses of the ocean to establish exclusion zones. From exclusion zones, bathymetry, and turbine tower water depth limitations, the water sheet area available for wind turbines is calculated. The second step is calculation of power production starting from available area, which determines the location and count of turbines. Then existing wind data are extrapolated to turbine height and, along with the turbine power output curve, they are used to establish the expected electric power production on an hourly basis. The third step calculates market value based on the hourly electric market at the nearest electric grid node. To illustrate these methods, we assess the offshore wind resource of the US state of Delaware. We find year-round average output of over 5200 MW, or about four times the average electrical consumption of the state. On local wholesale electricity markets, this would produce just over $2 billion/year in revenue.

Addressing this problem requires the use of novel approaches capable of capturing the inherent variability in the mechanisms involved.Methodology/Principal Findings: In this study we test whether dispersal and connectivity patterns generated from a biophysical model of larval dispersal of the crab Carcinus maenas, along the west coast of the Iberian Peninsula, can predict the highly variable daily pattern of wind-driven larval supply to an estuary observed during the peak reproductive season (March-June) in 2006 and 2007. Cross-correlations between observed and predicted supply were significant (p < 0.05) and strong, ranging from 0.34 to 0.81 at time lags of -6 to + 5 d. Importantly, the model correctly predicted observed cross-shelf distributions (Pearson r = 0.82, p < 0.001, and r = 0.79, p < 0.01, in 2006 and 2007) and indicated that all supply events were comprised of larvae that had been retained within the inner shelf; larvae transported to the outer shelf and beyond never recruited. Estimated average dispersal distances ranged from 57 to 198 km and were only marginally affected by mortality.Conclusions/Significance: The high degree of predicted demographic connectivity over relatively large geographic scales is consistent with the lack of genetic structuring in C. maenas along the Iberian Peninsula. These findings indicate that the dynamic nature of larval dispersal can be captured by mechanistic biophysical models, which can be used to provide meaningful predictions of the patterns and causes of fine-scale variability in larval supply to marine populations.",,,,,,,,,31,0,0,0,21,0,37,,,1932-6203,,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Aveiro, Ctr Estudos Ambiente & Mar CESAM, P-3800 Aveiro, PortugalUniv Aveiro, Dept Biol, P-3800 Aveiro, PortugalUniv Aveiro, Dept Fis, P-3800 Aveiro, Portugal",,,,2012-07-12,WOS:000305345200079,22558225,

Although offshore wind farms have been developed in Europe and Asia, the Block Island Wind Farm (BIWF) is the first offshore wind farm built in North America. To improve marine resource management, it is critical to understand the impacts of the wind farm on marine resource users in context. Little is known about the impacts of offshore wind farms on marine resource users in the United States. This study investigates recreational and commercial fishers' perceptions of the impacts of the BIWF on the local marine ecosystem. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 25 fishers, mostly based out of Block Island or Point Judith, Rhode Island (US), in the summer and fall of 2017. During the interviews, fishers were asked about their perceptions of changes in the marine ecology of the wind farm area during and after the offshore wind turbines were constructed, and how their activities in the area have changed since the wind farm was installed. Results indicate that there were perceived impacts of the BIWF on the local ecosystem and the behavior of the marine resource users. For some recreational fishers, the wind farm functioned as a destination or target and served as an artificial reef for spearfishing. For some commercial fishers, the increase in recreational fishing due to the establishment of the BIWF crowded out commercial fishers in these areas. As the offshore wind farm industry expands within US waters, findings from this study and others like it can provide valuable insights on the potential impacts of these wind farms on marine resource users.

To reach the objective of no brine discharge the salt from seawater must be completely separated and obtained as a secondary and valuable product. If no CO 2 emission increase is desired, the power source must be a combination of renewable energy systems (RES). This paper presents an analysis of an integrated desalination scheme consisting of two sequential systems: a multi-effect distillation (MED) plant and a mechanical vapour compression (MVC) system based on evaporator equipment. The energy is obtained by several wind turbines (WT) and a thermal solar collector (TSC) field. Separation of salt and water is achieved in a coupled multi-effect distillation-mechanical vapour compression (MED + MVC) two step process. The MED stage is driven by thermal solar collectors, whereas the energy consuming mechanical compression of the vapour (MVC) is fuelled by wind-powered turbines. Interestingly, the final products of this process are dry salt and fresh water. Such a system has been designed and dimensioned for a throughput of 100 m(3)/h of desalted water A preliminary study of the investment, amortization and exploitation costs of a combined MED + MVC + WT + TSC installation with these dimensions has been done. The price of desalted water, after considering the profits due to the sale of salt and electricity has been estimated at 0.59 (sic)/m(3). If the initial investment has a 35% subsidy, a final price of 0.41 (sic)/m(3) could be ensured, which is near the price associated to conventional energy sources.

Airborne taxa such as birds may be particularly sensitive to collision mortality with wind turbines, yet the relative vulnerability of species' populations across their annual life cycles has not been evaluated. Using GPS telemetry, we studied the movements of lesser black-backed gulls Larus fuscus from three UK breeding colonies through their annual cycle. We modelled the distance travelled by birds at altitudes between the minimum and maximum rotor sweep zone of turbines, combined with the probability of collision, to estimate sensitivity to collision. Sensitivity was then combined with turbine density (exposure) to evaluate spatio-temporal vulnerability. Sensitivity was highest near to colonies during the breeding season, where a greater distance travelled by birds was in concentrated areas where they were exposed to turbines. Consequently, vulnerability was high near to colonies but was also high at some migration bottlenecks and wintering sites where, despite a reduced sensitivity, exposure to turbines was greatest. Synthesis and applications. Our framework combines bird-borne telemetry and spatial data on the location of wind turbines to identify potential areas of conflict for migratory populations throughout their annual cycle. This approach can aid the wind farm planning process by: (a) providing sensitivity maps to inform wind farm placement, helping minimize impacts; (b) identifying areas of high vulnerability where mitigation warrants exploration; (c) highlighting potential cumulative impacts of developments over international boundaries and (d) informing the conservation status of species at protected sites.

Electric Propulsion Systems are proven robust and provide benefits such as load profile flexibility, elimination of torque transients, redundancy, and improved fuel efficiency through sophisticated power management systems. Today fuel flexibility includes the use of carbon neutral fuels such as hydrogen and ammonia due to the fact that these fuels are not comprised of greenhouse gasses. Also there is an infinite amount of hydrogen and it can be isolated using renewable energy. The electro-chemical process of a hydrogen powered fuel cell produces electricity and water vapor. The hydrogen supplied to the fuel cell could also be reformed from other fuels. A diesel engine running on ammonia produces zero greenhouse gasses. Advances in hybrid electric propulsion systems provides a platform for renewable harvesting energy sources. A DC bus can provided a hybrid platform for a multitude of DC energy sources to include renewables. These energy sources are an ever-changing landscape and include fuel cells, diesel and turbo generators, batteries, supercapacitors, wind turbines, solar panels, thermal recovery systems, and hydro-turbines to name a few.

The article provides an overview on the current state of transdisciplinary research on a potential implementation of such a multifunctional use concept on a showcase basis, covering biological, technical, economic and social/policy aspects as well as private-public partnerships and the relevant institutional bodies. We show that the cultivation of seaweeds and blue mussels is biologically and technically feasible in a high-energy environment using modified cultivation strategies. The point of departure of our multi-use concept was that the solid groundings of wind turbines could serve as attachment points for the aquaculture installations and become the key to the successful commercial cultivation of any offshore aquatic organism. However, spaces in between the turbines are also attractive for farming projects, since public access is restricted and thus the cultivation site protected from outside influences. An economic analysis of different operation scenarios indicates that the market price and the annual settlement success of juvenile mussels are the main factors that determine the breakeven point. Social and policy science research reveals that the integration of relevant actors into the development of a multi-use concept for a wind farm-mariculture interaction is a complex and controversial issue. Combining knowledge and experience of wind farm planners as well as mussel fishermen and mariculturists within the framework of national and EU policies is probably the most important component for designing and developing an effective offshore co-management regime to limit the consumption of ocean space.",,,,,,,,,57,0,0,0,27,0,59,,,1438-387X,1438-3888,,,,,,,,,,"Alfred Wegener Inst Polar & Marine Res AWI, D-27550 Bremerhaven, GermanyInst Marine Resources IMARE, D-27570 Bremerhaven, GermanyBremerhaven Univ Appl Sci, D-27568 Bremerhaven, GermanyCtr Trop Marine Ecol ZMT, D-28359 Bremen, GermanyJacobs Univ Bremen gGmbH, D-28759 Bremen, GermanyAlfred Wegener Inst Polar & Marine Res, Biol Inst Helgoland BAH, D-27483 Helgoland, GermanyUniv Bremen, D-28359 Bremen, Germany",Inst Marine Resources IMAREBremerhaven Univ Appl Sci,,,2008-09-01,WOS:000258276800008,,
J,,,,,,,,,Martin Austin,,Measurable metrics for characterisation of large-scale turbulent structures in tidal races for the marine tidal energy industry,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Awarded Grant,Jun 30 2017,2017,"The marine renewable energy industry is vital to the future energy security of the UK as climate change necessitates the shift towards low carbon energy sources. Ocean energy represents a vast and largely untapped resource and the shallow seas around the UK represent one the best tidal energy resources globally, accounting for some 10% of the total resource. In consequence, the tidal energy industry is an emerging and steadily growing sector of the UK economy. However, the potentially highest yield tidal environments (i.e. tidal races) are particularly challenging environments for development due to the strong currents and in particular very turbulent flows. Optimum and efficient design of tidal energy convertors (TECs) therefore requires the characterisation of both the flow and turbulence at potential sites for development.The aim of this project is to develop techniques, which are directly applied to enhance the technological capability of oceanographic measurement equipment, for the characterisation of key aspects of turbulence, and hence identification of appropriate turbulence parameters, to aid the design and operation of TECs. The main technical challenge in the development of the marine tidal energy sector is the design, deployment and operation, over the long term, of cost effective in-stream TEC devices which are able to survive the extreme conditions associated with potentially high yield regions (ie. rapid tidal currents). A key requirement in the development of the industry is therefore methodology for site survey which provides characterisation of appropriate turbulent parameters. Measurements demonstrate that turbulent kinetic energy dissipation is strongly linked to tidal current speed, in a confined channel it is highly variable, fluctuating by over an order of magnitude for a given flow speed. However, commonly used acoustic techniques fail to resolve this variability in dissipation, which results from the formation of coherent structures. Furthermore, these measurements do not provide accessible information on the larger scale structure of turbulence, ie. the scales, structure/coherency and stress, which are most likely to compromise the structural integrity of the tidal energy infrastructure and effect power yield. Here we propose to develop and test new methodologies, using measurements from the latest generation of off-the-shelf 5-beam acoustic Doppler current profilers (ADCPs), to provide a more appropriate and comprehensive characterisation of turbulence at length scales directly relevant to the design of tidal stream energy generation infrastructure. The immediate relevance of these developments will be insured through collaboration with our partners, ADCP manufacturer Nortek and marine energy site survey company Partrac. In particular, we will exploit our previous observations that structure function techniques applied to multi-beamed acoustic current profilers can be used to provide a measure of anisotropy of turbulence.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,EP/R000611/1,,,,,,,,Bangor University,,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:15376791,,

As the majority of the capital investment in offshore wind is in the form of infrastructure and operation and maintenance costs, reducing these expenditures could greatly reduce the cost of energy (COE) for an offshore wind project. Sandia National Laboratory and its partners (TU Delft, University of Maine, Iowa State, and TPI Composites) believe that vertical axis wind turbines (VAWTs) offer multiple advantages over other rotor configurations considering this new COE breakdown. The unique arrangement of a VAWT allows the heavy generator and related components to be located at the base of the tower as opposed to the top, as is typical of a horizontal axis wind turbine (HAWT). This configuration lowers the topside CG which reduces the platform stability requirements, leading to smaller and cheaper platforms. Additionally this locates high maintenance systems close to the ocean surface thus increasing maintainability. To support this project and the general wind research community, the Offshore Wind ENergy Simulation (OWENS) toolkit is being developed in conjunction with Texas A&M as an open source, modular aero-elastic analysis code with the capability to analyze floating VAWTS. The OWENS toolkit aims to establish a robust and flexible -finite element framework and VAWT mesh generation utility, coupled with a modular interface that allows users to integrate easily with existing codes, such as aerodynamic and hydrodynamic codes.Current efforts to include a hydrodynamic module are focused on coupling WavEC2Wire with OWENS. WavEC2Wire is a wave-to-wire numerical model developed by Marco Alves at the Insituto Superior Tecnico for the analysis of wave energy converter devices. It has been adapted from its original form and restructured for use as a hydrodynamic module capable of providing OWENS with necessary floating platform dynamics. Hence, WavEC2Wire functions as a rigid-body solver designed to calculate the platform motion due to wave loads, moorings, and the influence of the attached VAWT and tower. This paper presents the WavEC2Wire module and details the OWENS coupling method. Additionally, planned improvements in the WavEC2Wire module as well as future development in OWENS are presented.",,,,,"33rd ASME International Conference on Ocean, Offshore and Arctic Engineering33rd ASME International Conference on Ocean, Offshore and Arctic Engineering","JUN 08-13, 2014JUN 08-13, 2014","ASME, Ocean, Offshore & Arct Engn DivASME, Ocean, Offshore & Arct Engn Div","San Francisco, CASan Francisco, CA",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,978-0-7918-4554-7,,,,,,,,,"Univ Maine, Orono, ME 04469 USASandia Natl Labs, Albuquerque, NM 87185 USATexas A&M Univ, College Stn, TX USAWave Energy Ctr, Lisbon, Portugal",Wave Energy Ctr,,,2015-11-18,WOS:000363499100027,,

Offshore wind energy (herein referred to as offshore wind) has become a significant contributor to the global energy market, and the number of projects in the United States is rapidly increasing. As the technology continues to improve, the ability to deploy offshore wind turbines in deeper waters becomes increasingly feasible; however, differences in deployment environments bring unique challenges. To continue developing offshore wind as a viable renewable energy source, the United States must overcome three critical hurdles: (1) reduce the cost of generating offshore wind electricity, (2) accelerate the deployment and permitting process, and (3) integrate the new electrical source with the national grid. This work aims to help reduce time and costs associated with planning, development, and permitting by accurately predicting environmental responses to the presence of offshore wind arrays. We demonstrate that interactions between offshore wind infrastructure and the environment can be accurately assessed through a focused model development and validation process that considers the interrelationships between ocean waves, circulation, and seabed dynamics.

The Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) designated ~170 km2 of shelf area for wind energy development off the coast of Maryland, USA. In order to understand potential environmental impacts of wind turbine installation on the benthic ecosystem within the designated area, we conducted a study to visually characterize bottom habitats and epibenthic communities in the Mid-Atlantic Outer Continental Shelf blocks of the Maryland wind energy area. Seven 5 km long transects were sampled using a towed camera sled with a downward-facing digital camera that captured images at 5 frames∙s-1s. Additional small-mesh beam trawling was also conducted at selected locations complementary for species identification.. Image data were analyzed using two image selection methods, random and systematic (i.e. video frames were selected at various intervals). For both methods, estimates of community diversity (Hills N2) stabilized with sample sizes ranging from 316 to 398 frames. Our results allowed us to define distinct epibenthic communities and bottom habitats that are associated with offshore wind energy sites and to develop a sampling technique for digital images that can be applied to other research programs.

Their urban populations rely heavily on imported energy, yet have untapped renewable resources wave, tidal, offshore wind and solar resources often from diffuse sunlight. They are also industrialised nations with advanced research capabilities to address the scientific, engineering, economic, environmental and social challenges. The project is founded on a best-with-best partnership between the University of Edinburgh and six universities in Japan and Taiwan. The project's vision is to use two-way secondments doing novel research to build a platform of shared success, upon which a broadening to other subject areas, and other partner institutions can be built. Thus the actual research areas above lie at the heart of this Partnership's work. Embracing these core activities are shared activities in post-graduate training; academic, government, industrial and public engagement. The Partnership is focussed on some exciting areas ripe for research-led, rapid development in the field of new energy technologies. These span wave energy; tidal stream energy; offshore wind energy; solar cells, and underpinning energy materials. In each of these five thematic areas, Edinburgh experts will expand existing collaborations to deliver real research outcomes.Theme 1, on coastal wave energy, sees Edinburgh wave energy expertise teamed with Japanese coastal engineering / breakwater expertise - a synergy which can deliver design uncertainty and project risk reduction, and consequent economic advantage.Theme 2 will explore a novel tidal current measurement sensor for deployment offshore. One of the biggest single uncertainties in assessing (and costing) tidal stream energy is the machine's performance in real flows, as opposed to laboratory conditions. Field measurement is the key to progress here, and this device has the potential for major impact.Theme 3 focuses on condition monitoring for offshore wind turbines. Moving from single machines in pilot schemes to large farms, issues of reliability become paramount to risk (and cost) reduction. This work can.Theme 4 focuses on solar cell materials for devices that generate electricity from diffuse sunlight as is appropriate to UK, Japan and Taiwan settings. These hybrid cells are a promising technology to meet future energy needs.Theme 5 will explore fundamental aspects of energy-related materials, using high pressures to generate new materials and explore their properties. A class of promising materials for white light LEDs, which are already widely used as efficient everyday light sources will be one of the main targets.The Partnership's funded period is 12 months only, so there exists a serious challenge to make these activities sustainable. The strategic will be to use rapid research progress as a lever to deepen and extend these Partnerships, and to extend the network to engage further strategic partners. To these ends, near the end of the 12-month funded period, the Partnership will stage back-to-back Showcase events, in Taiwan and in Japan. These two-day events will see conventional dissemination activity complemented by open, ideas-generating research scoping workshop activities. The attendees should include not only academics with shared interests, but also other stakeholders in the new energy fields, very much including private and government sectors.The project benefits from an agreement between the UK funders (EPSRC) and the Taiwan National Science Council (NSC) to enable matching Taiwanese support to be sought straightforwardly.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,EP/K004468/1,,,,,,,,University of Edinburgh,,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:15307451,,

Federal laws protecting birds and endangered species, as well as environmental impact assessment requirements applicable to federal agency actions and approvals, have already affected approval and operation of renewable energy facilities.

We describe a top-down fabrication method to form superhydrophobic micro-hierarchical metal surface using photolithography, nanoimprinting, and continuous metal-to-metal replication using pulse-reverse-current electrochemical deposition. The surfaces were formed of nickel, which has a large hardness and is resistant to corrosion, making it suitable for use in harsh external conditions. We compared the measured wettability of fabricated micro-hierarchical metal surface with that from numerical simulations. The contact angle and contact angle hysteresis of four metal surfaces were measured (i.e., a bare surface, a random nanostructured surface, an engineered nanostructured surface, and an engineered hierarchical structured surface), and the anti-icing properties of these four metal surfaces were investigated.

While the distance from the shore to a wind farm is limited due to the cost of electric transmission, the near shore area has considerable traffic of ships and is restricted by complex rights of local fisheries. One approach to the problem is inviting the local fishermen to the management of the wind farm. It requires higher economic performance of the wind farm than the original fishing activity in the same sea surface area.The proposed concept is the combination of a floating wind turbine and counter-rotating water current turbine. The water current turbine partially cancels the reaction torque of electric generator and provides additional energy production from water current. The rotating axis of the turbine is not fixed in the upright position to reduce the size of supporting structure. Regular maintenance work is only in low altitude on the float.

On the other hand, shallow offshore foundations can rarely be placed on top of the sea floor: Weak soils usually need to be excavated to place the foundation structure on more stable ground and thus, anthropogenic submarine slopes result. Steep but stable slopes meet both economic and ecologic aims as they minimise material movement and sediment disturbance. After Terzaghi [1] the angle beta between slope and the horizontal of the ground surface of coarse-grained soil is at most equal to the critical state friction angle phi(c). However it can be observed that natural submarine slopes of sandy soils are always much more shallow. Particularly fine-grained, cohesionless or almost cohesionless soils failed in the past, although the slope angle was much smaller than the critical state friction angle phi(c). Artificial (temporary) slopes do not appear and behave as natural submarine slopes, since the latter are already shaped by perpetual loads of waves, tide and mass movements. Physical simulations of different scales are used to analyse the stability of artificial submarine slopes with sandy soil of the North Sea.

Secondly, the influences of four factors, namely the wind inflow direction, the thrust coefficient, the pitch angle of each unit in the wind field and the relationship between the thrust coefficient, the induction factor and the utilization of wind energy, on the wake flow of the downstream fan are analyzed and discussed in detail. Furthermore, for wake effect, the optimal control strategy is obtained by studying the superposition algorithm of wake, particle swarm optimization control and the relationship between thrust coefficient, induction factor and output power. Finally, Horns Rev wind farm is taken as the research object of this paper, and Matlab is used to carry out coding simulation: other values are unchanged, wind speed is taken as a variable, and different assumed wind speeds are input, then the actual wind speed corresponding to each wind turbine can be obtained.

Many countries such as UK, Denmark, Germany, China, etc thus are expanding their investment on it. Korea also aimed to foster offshore wind industry as the nation’s new growth engine and announced the project of a southwestern coast 2.5GW offshore wind farm. To facilitate the project, Korean government appointed Gunsan port for supporting the construction of the offshore wind farm, which is located in the Saemangeum area. In particular, the port will be expected to play the role of a logistics base for off-loading, storage, assembly and transportation of large-heavy wind turbines and sub-structures. In addition to the offshore wind port, offshore wind turbine related manufactures such as Hyundai Heavy Industrial Ltd. KM Co. Ltd. DACC Co. Ltd. etc have already been moved in the national industrial parks of Saemangeum-Gunsan region so that it has sufficient potential to be a strategic location for offshore wind power cluster. China has a goal to install over 10GW by 2020 according to the national plan of renewable energy development. In fact, China’s NEA(National Energy Administration) in 2009 requested 11 provincial governments along the east coast of China(Shanghai, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Shandong, etc) to give in the plans of offshore wind development and finally established a national plan for large capacity offshore wind farms.In this regard, the offshore wind farms to be installed in the east coast of China are close to Saemangeum-Gunsan area so that this paper proposed three cooperation measures with respect to the Saemangeum’s geographical advantages. First, it is to build a cooperations system of Korea-China international specialization on offshore wind power. It is explained that Jeonbuk province where shipbuilding, offshore plant, and machine part manufactures have been already running their businesses has been placed increasing pressure to clarify policy around support, subsidies, and overall framework policies.

The jacket sub structure is modelled in moderate deep waters of 50m and designed for the 5MW NREL baseline wind turbine. External conditions are based on wind and wave joint distribution for a site in the North Sea. The turbulent wind field in HAWC2 is generated by random values, defined by the Mann Turbulence model, for each operational mean wind speed. A four-legged jacket structure similar to the Upwind reference jacket is developed in the Abaqus environment, to which is added the transition piece and tower. The aeroelastic loads determined in normal operating conditions of the turbine is integrated and centralized as nodal forces and moments acting at the tower top of the finite element model. Hydrodynamic loads from the incoming waves are computed using the Morison equation and based on a nonlinear irregular wave field. Velocities, accelerations and amplitudes of the wave field as well as tower top forces and moments are used as inputs for the structural analysis in Abaqus. The fully coupled simulation is implemented and performed in HAWC2. In the uncoupled case, the loads (wave loads and tower base loads) are analysed by an implicit structural Finite Element Analysis (Abaqus 6.11-1). A subroutine is used as a preprocessor generating a beam element model and linking the loads to the components as nodal forces. In both simulation cases, the integrated loads acting on the jacket legs are computed as time series and as damage equivalent loading. The analysis and comparison of the fully coupled and decoupled simulation method show that the results vary depending on the structural stiffness and the applied wave loads. Variation in the amplitudes of the moments and forces on the jacket legs up to 25% was observed between the results obtained from coupled and uncoupled simulations. (C) 2013 The Authors.

Among these are for example dynamic and cyclic loadings caused by wind and sea waves. Concrete fatigue processes are dominant degradation processes (a) that determine the technical lifetime of such foundations, and (b) that are difficult to determine in occurrence, severity and with regard to the redistribution characteristics in the cross section or structure using classical inspection or monitoring programs. Semi-Markov Chain approaches, which are based on process sojourn time considerations, combined with smart monitoring sensor systems and advanced nonlinear Finite Element simulation methods, present very promising approaches for the realistic description of concrete fatigue processes and their redistribution characteristics and in consequence for the prediction of the remaining lifetime. The objectives of the current work are (a) to present a Semi-Markov Chain approach that is based on smart monitoring information and on advanced nonlinear Finite Element simulations for the realistic assessment and the prediction of concrete fatigue processes, and (b) to demonstrate the Semi-Markov Chain approach on an offshore wind energy tower concrete foundation in Cuxhaven.

An important aspect is that the scour protection itself causes erosion, inflicted by the local increase in current and/or wave velocities and in turn increased bed shear stresses. Scour of the edge material alongside the scour protection may cause deformations and failure of the scour protection of offshore wind turbine foundations. This can reduce the stability of the stone layer and cause exposure of cables running between the monopiles where they go from buried to the transition piece on the foundation. Although much information is available on the design of scour protection systems around monopiles, little is known on the mechanisms causing edge scour and the equilibrium stages of the edge scour process in steady current, waves and combined waves and current.This paper presents an extensive experimental campaign to explain the edge scour process in current and combined irregular waves and current, as well as tidal current. The three-dimensional flow field around the pile and scour protection is resolved by particle image velocimetry and bed shear stress measurements, showing a local increase in the flow velocities and bed shear stresses leading to increased sediment transport and scour. The governing process in steady current is a pair of symmetrical counter-rotating vortices emerging in the near bed region in the wake of the pile and scour protection, causing a significant downstream scour hole. It is found that the equilibrium scour hole depth and length scales with the pile diameter and the ratio between the thickness- and the width of the scour protection.In the second part of the present paper, the results from the experimental campaign are compared with the edge scour experienced in practice, outlined by a survey program of the offshore wind park Egmond Aan Zee and a published field investigation of Scroby Sands OWE by Whitehouse et al.

These measurements were analyzed to investigate variations in rise time, decay time, pulse duration, kurtosis, and sound received levels as a function of range and azimuth. Variations in the radiated sound field along opposing azimuths resulted in differences in measured sound exposure levels of up to 10 dB and greater due to the pile rake as the sound propagated in range. The raked pile configuration was modeled using an equivalent axisymmetric FEM model to describe the azimuthally dependent measured sound fields.

We used marine radar to study murrelets year-round during the peak dawn activity period (n = 78 mornings) at three high-use sites in northern California. Murrelet passage rates were relatively low in winter (11%-47% of summer rates), increased in spring, peaked during the summer breeding period (late April-July) and were lowest during the fall molt period. We observed large among-site differences in mean flight altitudes of murrelets between two sites along the coast (93 +/- 3 m and 98 +/- 3 m above ground level [agl]) and a single site further inland (257 +/- 6 m agl). Flight altitudes during periods with fog or scattered rain did not differ significantly from altitudes during periods without precipitation.

In this regard, the EE-IO-LCA model can be combined with an intuitionistic fuzzy set theory for a multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) application with a set of environmental and socio-economic indicators. To achieve this goal, this study proposes the use of the Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution method to select the best wind energy alternative for a double layer MCDM problem, which requires expert judgments to simultaneously apply appropriate weighting to each life cycle phase and sustainability indicator to be considered. The novelty of this research is to propose a generic 9-step fuzzy MCDM method to solve sustainable energy decision-making problems using a combination of three different techniques: (1) an intuitionistic fuzzy entropy method to identify the individual importance of phases and criteria; (2) an IFWGA operator to establish a sub-decision matrix with the weights applied to all relevant attributes; and (3) an IFWAA operator to build a super-decision matrix with the weights applied to all of the life-cycle phases considered. This proposed method is then applied as a case study for sustainable energy planning, specifically for the selection of V80 and V90 onshore and offshore wind turbines to be installed in the United States.

The global growth of offshore wind technology is likely to be accompanied by reductions in wind park construction costs, both as a result of scaling and learning effects. Since 2005, however, significant cost increases have been observed. A recent surge in commodity prices proves to constitute one of the main drivers of these cost increases. This observation begs the question whether wind turbine manufacturers should return to the laboratory for undertaking R&D that explores the use of alternative materials and bring offshore wind energy closer to competitiveness. It is demonstrated that if one abstracts from material price fluctuations, in particular for metals such as copper and steel, turbine production plus installation cost data publicly available for a series of offshore wind park projects (realized in several European countries since the 1990's) show a cost reduction trend. Hence various other sources of cost increases, such as due to the progressively larger distances from the shore (and correspondingly greater depths at sea) at which wind parks have been (and will be) built, are outshadowed by cost reduction effects. When one expresses the overall cost development for offshore wind energy capacity as an experience curve, a learning rate is found of 3%, which reflects a mixture of economies-of-scale and learning-by-doing mechanisms. Also the impact is quantified on offshore wind power construction costs from the recent tightness in the market for turbine manufacturing and installation services: without the demand-supply response inertia at the origin of this tightness it is estimated that the learning rate would be 5%. Since these learning rates are relatively low - in comparison to those observed for other technologies, and in view of the high current capacity costs of offshore wind in comparison to onshore wind energy - a renewed focus on learning-by-searching or R&D is recommended.

These structures become colonised by sedentary organisms and non-migratory reef fish, and form local ecosystems that attract larger predators including seals, birds, and fish. It is possible that these structures form a system of interconnected reef environments through the planktonic dispersal of the pelagic stages of organisms by ocean currents. Changes to the overall arrangement of hard substrate areas through removal or addition of individual man-made structures will affect the interconnectivity and could impact on the ecosystem. Here, we assessed the connectivity of sectors with oil and gas structures, wind farms, wrecks, and natural hard substrate, using a model that simulates the drift of planktonic stages of seven organisms with sedentary adult stages associated with hard substrate, applied to the period 2001-2010.

The installation of the suction caisson is of great importance in the design and construction because it can bring about several issues and further influence the performance of holding capacity in safety service. In this paper, large deformation finite element (FE) analyses are performed to model the installation of suction caisson (SC) by suction and jacking in normally consolidated clay. The penetration of the suction caisson is modeled using an axisymmetric FE approach with the help of the Arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian (ALE) formulation which can satisfactorily solve the large deformation problem. The undrained shear strength of the clay and elastic modulus are varied with depth of soil through the subroutine VUFIELD. The numerical results allow quantification of the penetration resistance and its dependence on the installation method. The centrifuge test and theoretical solution are used for the FE model validation. After the validation, the penetration resistance, the soil plug heave, and the caisson wall friction have been examined through the FE model. Based on the numerical results, it is shown that the ALE technique can simulate the entire suction caisson penetration without mesh distortion problem. The installation method can play an important role on the penetration resistance, namely, the suction installation reduces the penetration resistance significantly compared to the purely jacked installation. With a further study on the suction case, it is found that as the final applied suction pressure increases, the soil plug heave increases, while the penetration resistance reduces with increase of the final suction pressure. The effect of the friction of internal caisson walls has been also investigated and a conclusion is drawn that internal wall friction has a significant contribution to the penetration resistance and it can be implicitly represented by varying coefficient of internal wall friction. As for the penetration resistance, both jacked and suction installation have great dependency on the internal wall friction.",,,,,,,,,17,2,0,0,0,0,19,,,1064-119X,1521-0618,,,,,,,,,,"Dalian Univ Technol, State Key Lab Coastal & Offshore Engn, Room 213,Zongheshiyan 1 Bldg,2 Linggong Rd, Dalian 116024, Peoples R ChinaDalian Univ Technol, Ocean Engn Joint Res Ctr DUT UWA, Dalian, Peoples R ChinaThird Railway Survey & Design Inst Grp Corp, Tianjin, Peoples R China",Third Railway Survey & Design Inst Grp Corp,,,2018-12-28,WOS:000446220800003,,

However, the decision to repower a site is influenced by a list of factors and key stakeholders. Given the complexity of the decision-making process, the use of multi-criteria decision analysis provides a valuable tool for decision-makers, facilitating a structured framework to identify the best possible option for all stakeholders. In this study, PROMETHEE II method is applied to the case of Bockstigen offshore wind farm. Four scenarios were designed, varying the total capacity and the number of turbines, and evaluated against fourteen criteria and seven relevant stakeholders, including their preferences for all of the criteria. Application of the PROMETHEE II provided a ranking of repowering scenarios, offering several key conclusions, such as the link between wind park capacity and stakeholder preference.

However, the regulations about pollutant emissions imposed by the International Maritime Organization are becoming more and more strict. In order to face up to this issue, the energy system of cruise ships is constantly being modified. In this paper, the structure of the cruise ship's energy system with multiple facilities such as an internal combustion engine, gas turbine, dual fuel engine, PV panels, and the wind turbine is preestablished. Then, a multi-objective mathematical programming model is formulated to determine the selection and capacity of facilities with minimal total annual cost and size, while the emissions, energy balance and technical constraints are taken into account. By adopting the augmented epsilon-constraint method, the design and operation strategies could be obtained. As an illustrated example, the model is applied to a real cruise ship, and the Pareto frontier could provide ship designers with well-balanced solutions based on economic and size priorities, and with the increase in the proportion of size objective, the total annual cost increases and size decreases gradually. Compared with the reference energy system, the optimal energy system could reduce the total annual cost by 12.6% if only the economic objective is considered and reduce the size by 21.1% if only the size objective is considered. In multi objective condition, the CO, NOx, and SOx emissions could be reduced by 29.1%-61.3%, 42.8%-61.3%, and 42.8%-613% per year, respectively. Moreover, a sensitivity analysis is conducted, and the result shows that the size and consumption cost of Marine Gas Oil (MGO) and Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) are more sensitive to the change of the proportion of size objective compared to Heavy fuel oil (HFO) and Marine diesel oil (MDO).

Artificial structures do not only modify marine and coastal ecosystems at the sites of their placement, but may also produce larger-scale impacts through their alteration of ecological connectivity - the movement of organisms, materials and energy between habitat units within seascapes. Despite the growing awareness of the capacity of ocean sprawl to influence ecological connectivity, we lack a comprehensive understanding of how artificial structures modify ecological connectivity in near- and off-shore environments, and when and where their effects on connectivity are greatest. We review the mechanisms by which ocean sprawl may modify ecological connectivity, including trophic connectivity associated with the flow of nutrients and resources. We also review demonstrated, inferred and likely ecological impacts of such changes to connectivity, at scales from genes to ecosystems, and potential strategies of management for mitigating these effects. Ocean sprawl may alter connectivity by: (1) creating barriers to the movement of some organisms and resources - by adding physical barriers or by modifying and fragmenting habitats; (2) introducing new structural material that acts as a conduit for the movement of other organisms or resources across the landscape; and (3) altering trophic connectivity. Changes to connectivity may, in turn, influence the genetic structure and size of populations, the distribution of species, and community structure and ecological functioning. Two main approaches to the assessment of ecological connectivity have been taken: (1) measurement of structural connectivity - the configuration of the landscape and habitat patches and their dynamics; and (2) measurement of functional connectivity - the response of organisms or particles to the landscape. Our review reveals the paucity of studies directly addressing the effects of artificial structures on ecological connectivity in the marine environment, particularly at large spatial and temporal scales. With the ongoing development of estuarine and marine environments, there is a pressing need for additional studies that quantify the effects of ocean sprawl on ecological connectivity. Understanding the mechanisms by which structures modify connectivity is essential if marine spatial planning and eco-engineering are to be effectively utilised to minimise impacts.

The literature shows more than 80 countries having wind installations and there is the expectation to have expanded investments to about U$ 3.6 trillion until 2040. High capacity wind generators are well developed and usually installed offshore where the wind velocity is relatively high and constant over most of the year. On the other hand, small windmills are usually installed for individual and community use in urban and isolated areas. These machines are usually supposed to generate energy at relatively low wind speeds, have simple construction and relatively low maintenance cost. This paper seeks to determine the aerodynamic performance and annual energy production for small horizontal axis windmill of 10 kW nominal power using airfoil of families NACA, Gottingen and Selig. The formulation of the aerodynamic model is based on the combined momentum and blade element theory. A numerical code is developed and validated against available numerical results showing good agreement. From the numerical predictions, it was found that for nominal speed of 10 m/s Gottingen airfoil produced the highest amount of energy. Further numerical investigation was realized to determine details of the rotor blades such as chord and twist angle distributions along the blade, variation of the axial and tangential induction factors and distributions of thrust and torque along the blade length.

The Offshore Wind Pilot Project was proposed by Principle Power, Inc, in May 2013. The proposed lease request is approximately 15 nautical miles offshore Coos Bay, Oregon with an area of approximately 15 square miles. The project would consist of five 6.0 megawatt (MW) wind turbine generators mounted on floating foundations, anchored to the seafloor in 1,200 to 1,600 feet water depth. This USGS study is funded by BOEM to acquire data and generate a CMECS habitat map in the area surrounding the Pilot Project site. Operations were conducted using the USGS R/V Parke Snavely equipped with a Reson 7111 multibeam sonar mounted on starboard side pole and a towed high definition video sled. Sonar data were acquired using Reson PDS 2000 software. Horizontal positions for navigation and data collection were determined by using a POS M/V V5 operating in Differential GPS (DGPS) mode. The horizontal datum was Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) Zone 10 North and the vertical datum was MLLW. The survey was conducted using 12 hour day operations out of Charleston Harbor near Coos Bay, Oregon. The cruise plan consisted of 23 days on site split between sonar mapping and video ground truth surveying. Activities parsed out to nine days of sonar mapping, three days of video surveying, eight days of no operations due to weather, and three days mobilizing and demobilizing. Typically the Snavely would transit out to the survey area in an hour at a speed of 20 knots. Multibeam sonar operations were conducted on north or south oriented tracklines at a speed of 4 to 5 knots depending on sea state. The optimal heading for sonar operations is isobath parallel. Video operations were conducted by deploying up drift of a target and drifting over it at speeds of 1 knot or less.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2019-06-04,DRCI:DATA2019077015700522,,

One solid way to address these issues is to exploit renewable energy resources efficiently. Hence, this study aims to investigate wind and solar energy use in the coastal areas of southern Iran for renewable-powered seawater desalination and hydrogen production systems.Design/methodology/approachTo accomplish the aforementioned purpose, five areas most prone to the problems in Iran, namely, Mahshahr, Jask and Chabahar ports and Kish and Hormoz islands were scrutinized. To ascertain the amount of wind and solar energy available in the areas, Weibull distribution function, Angstrom-Prescott equation and HOMER software were used.FindingsThe findings indicated that wind energy density in Kish was 2,014.86 (kWh/m(2).yr) and solar energy density in Jask equaled to 2,255.7 (kWh/m(2).yr) which possessed the best conditions among the areas under study. Moreover, three commercial wind turbines and three photovoltaic systems were examined for supplying energy needed by the water desalination and hydrogen production systems. The results showed that application of wind turbines with rated power of 660, 750 and 900 kWh in Kish could result in desalting 934,145, 1,263,339 and 2,000,450 (m(3)/yr) of seawater or producing 14,719, 20,896 and 31,521 (kg/yr) of hydrogen, respectively. Additionally, use of photovoltaic systems with efficiency of %14.4, %17.01 and %21.16 in Jask could desalinate 287, 444 and 464 (m(3)/yr) of seawater or generate 4.5, 7 and 7.3 (kg/yr) of hydrogen, respectively.Originality/valueCompared to the huge extent of water shortage and environmental pollution, there has not been conducted enough studies to obtain broader view regarding use of renewable energies to solve these issues in Iran.

Infaunal abundances were higher closer to the artificial structures; however, these differences did not result in statistically significant effects on diversity or richness in relation to distance from the structures, nor were they sufficient to cause statistically significant changes in infaunal communities as compared to reference areas.

S. electricity demand. Similar results could also be obtained in many parts of the world. The offshore environment can be used for unobtrusive, safe, and economical utility-scale energy storage by taking advantage of the hydrostatic pressure at ocean depths to store energy by pumping water out of concrete spheres and later allowing it to flow back in through a turbine to generate electricity. The storage spheres are an ideal complement to energy harvesting machines, such as floating wind turbines (FWTs). The system could provide near-base-load-quality utility-scale renewable energy and do double duty as the anchoring point for the generation platforms. Analysis indicates that storage can be economically feasible at depths as shallow as 200 m, with cost per megawatt hour of storage dropping until 1500 m before beginning to trend upward. The sweet spot occurs when the concrete wall thickness to withstand the hydrostatic pressure provides enough ballast mass, and this will depend on the strength of used concrete and reinforcement.

For this purpose, an in-depth experimental campaign was carried out using a 1:40 scale model of the wave energy converter sub-system and the monopile substructure, considering regular and irregular waves. Based on the experimental results the performance of the device and its interaction with the wave field were characterised a fundamental step to fully understand the benefits and limitations of this hybrid wind-wave system, which sets the basis for its future development. Regarding the performance, the best efficiency was obtained with the turbine damping corresponding to a 0.5% orifice size, and two resonance peaks were identified (T = 9 and 6 s). As for the interaction of the hybrid system with the wave field, between 5% and 66% of the incident wave power is reflected and between 3% and 45%, transmitted.

The system is composed of seversl dock blocks, prefabricated in flexible sizes to allow for the fast assembly and installation (based on the LEGO concept), which makes the proposed system an ideal choice for variety of offshore infrastructures such as temporary/permanent bridges, water breakers, harbors, floating structural elements used in offshore power plants, tourist and residential areas as well as military and emergency bases. However, it is of particular interest for tidal energy power plants (Fig.1). Configuration of the dock is designed based on the vessel structural concept, including a cork residues-based core to provide the enough buoyancy and floating feature for the dock and an outer fiber reinforced self-compacting concrete (FRSCC) shell with an optimized content of hybrid fibers capable of suppressing the use of conventional steel stirrups due to their susceptibility to corrosion. The adopted FRSCC takes advantages of using recycled aggregates and fibers to develop a more affordable and eco-friendly dock system. Vegetable fibers and Pozolanic additions will be explored to provide self-healing requisites to the FRSCC and increase its durability. To make the proposed system corrosion free, the docks are flexurally reinforced using pre-stressed fiber reinforced polymeric (FRP) rebars. A venturi-shaped tube duct embedded in the proposed dock guides and accelerates tidal stream toward the central region of the duct, where a tidal turbine is installed. The docks can be equipped by a secondary external tidal turbine (based on design requirements of the power plant), moored beneath the floating dock.Motivation, innovation and proposed developmentsThe combination of steel (industrial and recycled) and vegetable (e.g. sisal) fibers will be explored, since high performance FRSCC can be developed using this hybrid fiber reinforcing concept, with excellent impact resistance and durability. The renewable vegetable fibers have capability of retaining water, contributing to the self-healing of the micro-cracks that can occur during the service life of the structure. The proposed structural system is totally immune to corrosion, since conventional steel stirrups is eliminated by using high shear resistance FRSCC, while the flexural reinforcement is only comprised of FRP rebars.The proposed floating dock element can be used for energy extraction from tidal current using two turbines, one embedded in each dock element, and the other moored beneath the dock. In this dock system, the internal machinery can be installed on top surface of the dock element, allowing ease access for routine maintenance and minimum water proofing costs. The proposed strategy overcomes environmental problems that occur frequently when turbines are installed on the seabed.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,PTDC/ECI-EGC/28112/2017,,,,,,,,Universidade do Minho,,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:15471272,,

Similarly, the need for an alternative to hydrocarbon fuels means that the number of fuel cell vehicles is also expected to increase. The ability of electricity networks to balance supply and demand is greatly affected by the variable, intermittent output of RE generators; however, this could be relieved using energy storage and demand-side response (DSR) techniques. One option would be production of hydrogen by electrolysis powered from wind and solar sources. The use of tariff structures would provide an incentive to operate electrolysers as dispatchable loads. The aim of this paper is to compare the cost of hydrogen production by electrolysis at garage forecourts in Libya, for both dispatchable and continuous operation, without interruption of fuel supply to vehicles. The coastal city of Derna was chosen as a case study, with the renewable energy being produced via a wind turbine farm. Wind speed was analysed in order to determine a suitable turbine, then the capacity was calculated to estimate how many turbines would be needed to meet demand. Finally, the excess power was calculated, based on the discrepancy between supply and demand. The study looked at a hydrogen refueling station in both dispatchable and continuous operation, using an optimisation algorithm. The following three scenarios were considered to determine whether the cost of electrolytic hydrogen could be reduced by a lower off-peak electricity price. These scenarios are: Standard Continuous, in which the electrolyser operates continuously on a standard tariff of 12 p/kWh; Off-peak Only, in which the electrolyser operates only during off-peak periods at the lower price of 5 p/kWh; and 2-Tier Continuous, in which the electrolyser operates continuously on a low tariff at off-peak times and a high tariff at other times. The results indicate that Scenario 2 produced the cheapest electricity at 2.90 pound per kg of hydrogen, followed by Scenario 3 at 3.80 pound per kg, and the most expensive was Scenario 1 at 6.90 pound per kg.",,,,,,,,,16,1,0,0,1,0,17,,,,2071-1050,,,,,,,,,,"De Montfort Univ, Inst Energy & Sustainable Dev, Queens Bldg, Leicester LE1 9BH, Leics, England",,,,2017-12-08,WOS:000414896200115,,

Between February 2004 and January 2007, seven dead white-tailed sea eagles were found near wind turbines in Hokkaido prefecture, Japan. We used this population as the target species in the management model. In the management model, we assumed that the bodies of any birds killed in collisions would disappear within 5 days, while the searches for carcasses were conducted every 30 days. The calculation period of the management model was 22 years, consisting of a 5-year planning period and a 17-year operation period. The operation management schedule was reviewed every three years. The utilized capacity was estimated from the data for 2003 to 2005 for Hokkaido. The operation rate multiplied by the utilized capacity gives the corrected utilized capacity. After the break-even point of the utilized capacity was determined, the time that fell below this was defined as the failure rate of the business. The results showed that the end point was achieved 99% of the time, while the failure rate was below 10%. An optimistic scenario was not affected by the two management scenarios or conditions used as protection measures. Conversely, a pessimistic scenario was achieved only under specific conditions in the management scenario. The main goals were to 1) estimate the number of days required for a carcass to disappear, 2) develop a search technique to improve the discovery rate of carcasses, 3) conduct regular surveys of carcasses, 4) determine the growth rate and population size by monitoring, 5) determine the results of breeding by breeding pairs in Hokkaido, and 6) examine risk hedging to deal with failure of the business.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,1342-4327,,,,,,,,,,,"Japan Weather Association Tokyo office, 3-1-1 Higashiikebukuro, Toyoshima, Tokyo 170-6055, Japan",,,,2007-11-01,ZOOREC:ZOOR14404024396,,

With an increasing impetus toward real-time decision making, delays incurred in offline laboratory oil analysis are becoming less acceptable. At present, several oil quality parameters can be monitored by commercially available sensors, and active research and development programmes are being pursued by both academic and industrial researchers to-develop robust, cost effective sensors for the remaining key parameters. Published (active) ASTM methods or practices do not yet cover the sensor technologies employed or under development, although work is in progress to address this deficit. This paper presents an overview of currently available oil condition sensors and looks at some recent developments, particularly in the following three areas: contamination by metallic wear debris, measurement of total water content, and determination of in-service oil viscosity. In each case, quite different technological solutions have been adopted. Where applicable, alignment and overlap with existing ASTM methods and practices will be reviewed and future directions indicated. Recent improvements in the sensitivity of inductive particle counters have enabled the detection of individual ferrous particles down to the sub-100 mu m diameter regime and close to the 100 mu m diameter mark for non-ferrous metals. Experiences of particle counters in wind turbine applications have shown the potential for enormous benefits in failure prevention. One standard practice covering the installation, operation, and requirements of such devices is published and a second is currently in draft mode. Online sensors utilising infrared transmission measurements recently have been developed by two independent companies. The systems are targeted primarily at marine diesel engine installations, although the method is not restricted solely to these applications. Maximum water content measurable depends on both the optical path length and the cleanliness of the oil. For marine applications a practical upper measurement limit of 1 % by volume has been adopted. In the system described here, a correction methodology, correlating to an accepted Deutsches Institut fur Normung-Fourier transform infrared standard, has been adopted to cope with oils contaminated by soot. Soot loading increases the opacity of the oil, causing a concomitant reduction in the maximum water content measurable. The correction procedure increases the accuracy of the water content measurement and additionally provides a determination of the soot content. Commercially available viscosity sensors include both the oscillating piston type and high frequency oscillating crystal designs; however, a cost effective device employing a low amplitude, mid -frequency vibrating sensor element has been developed recently. Key features include accurate measurements over a very wide viscosity range and an operating range that covers combustion engine oil temperatures and pressures. Correlation with existing ASTM methods and practices is presently limited to calibration aspects only.",,,,,"Symposium on In-Service Lubricant and Machine Analysis, Diagnotics, and PrognosticsSymposium on In-Service Lubricant and Machine Analysis, Diagnotics, and Prognostics","DEC 08, 2010DEC 08, 2010",ASTM CommASTM Comm,"Jacksonville, FLJacksonville, FL",1,0,0,0,0,0,1,,,0066-0558,,978-0-8031-7522-8,,,,,,,,,"Kittiwake Dev Ltd, 3-6 Thorgate Rd, Littlehampton, W Sussex, England",Kittiwake Dev Ltd,,,2011-01-01,WOS:000396646300007,,

The method uses publicly available oceanic, environmental and socio-economic data to identify areas less suitable for development due to physical or technical constraints, safety or other hazards, environmental concerns, or competing uses. Using wind speed data from meteorological buoys, annual energy output is calculated for a representative offshore wind turbine. The average power resource is determined by dividing the total available area by a wind regime and the turbine-specific effective turbine footprint, yielding the maximum number of turbines, and then derating the output to account for wake effects and operational availability.These techniques are applied to quantify the previously undocumented offshore wind resource off the coast of Maryland, a U.S. Atlantic coastal state. We consider only the open-ocean Atlantic and not Maryland's substantial estuary, the Chesapeake Bay. We find that the wind field is fairly uniform, but exclusions of ocean areas due to competing use may be substantial, reducing the energy resource estimate significantly. Nevertheless, we find that even excluding these areas Maryland's offshore wind resource could supply an annual average of 14,087 Megawatts (MWa), or 123,400 GWh of energy per year. This is equal to 189% of the state's annual electricity consumption. Further restricting to only shallower-water foundation technology (monopiles), average power output would still be 70% of electricity demand. We conclude with a discussion of policy options for coastal states. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

This paper is concerned with the timing of offshore turbine maintenance for a turbine that is no longer functioning. Service vehicle access is limited by the weather, with wave height being the important factor in deciding whether access can be achieved safely. If the vehicle is mobilized, but the wave height then exceeds the safe limit, the journey is wasted. Conversely, if the vehicle is not mobilized, and the wave height then does not exceed the limit, the opportunity to repair the turbine has been wasted. Previous work has based the decision as to whether to mobilize a service vessel on point forecasts for wave height. In this paper, we incorporate probabilistic forecasting to enable rational decision making by the maintenance engineers, and to improve situational awareness regarding risk. We show that, in terms of minimizing expected cost, the decision as to whether to send the service vessel depends on the value of the probability of wave height falling below the safe limit. We produce forecasts of this probability using time series methods specifically designed for generating wave height density forecasts, including ARMA-GARCH models. We evaluate the methods in terms of statistical probability forecast accuracy, as well as monetary impact, and we examine the sensitivity of the results to different values of the costs.

Previous studies have neglected effect of deformable ground by assuming that the soil within skirts behaves rigid during drained loading, but this assumption needs rigorous studies. A series of 3-D finite element analyses has been conducted to investigate directly how the skirt geometry, soil strength profile and deformable plug within skirt compartment affect the drained skirted foundation capacity under uniaxial loading.

In reality it is seen that the performance of the SHM techniques is still dependent on the inputs and the preferences of the engineer and as a result, on the experience and the skill of the engineer. The paper presents a semi-automated methodology for the damage detection and localization in a scaled model of an offshore support structure using fibre Bragg grating strain sensors for two damage scenarios namely deterioration of the support condition (simulated by introducing change in the attachment of a leg of a tripod) and a circumferential fatigue crack (simulated by unbolting the flange).The method consists of the offline setup step where the human inputs are provided. The system is trained based on the inputs of system performance, the factors such as thresholds for damage detection, the signal processing, etc. are determined. Once the system is trained, it is then deployed for automated, online damage detection. For the damage identification, a two-step damage method is employed which makes use of the ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD) technique. In the first step, if the damage metric is above a certain threshold, damage is said to be detected. Once the damage has been detected, the EEMD based metric is again used to calculate the damage localization index (DLI) which is used for the localization of the damage. The DLI is used to overcome biases due to higher relative amplitude of vibration of some rosettes. Application of the methodology for the different damage scenarios on several different excitation conditions indicates that the developed methodology is robust and may be used for damage identification in tripod structures.",,,,,,,,,11,0,0,0,0,0,11,,,0142-1123,1879-3452,,,,,,,,,,"Polish Acad Sci, Inst Fluid Flow Machinery, Gdansk, Poland",,,,2020-03-26,WOS:000518708500053,,

The simulation is based on calculating the net present cost (NPC), excess system electricity, cost of energy (COE) and carbon dioxide emissions (CO2). Through the study, the optimal configuration consists of 160 kW photo-voltaic (PV) panels, 19 strings of lead-acid batteries and a 50 kW diesel generator system. The optimal case achieves the lowest cost of energy ($0.107/kWh) and net present cost ($502,662). (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Since seabirds represent avoidance response to OWFs, risks of collisions between flying seabirds and the turbines may be relatively small. However, based on theoretical assuming of additional energetic costs of such avoidance flights, those potential impact on the body condition are considerable. The wind turbines and those base structures reduce or modify the foraging habitat of the seabirds and potentially alter food availability. While additional mortality and decline of breeding success by collision and the additional energetic costs are theoretically estimated, these estimation may not be so accurate because of lacking of sufficient empirical data and great uncertainties. Further long-term empirical studies and after-construction monitoring are needed. To mitigate the impact of OWFs on the seabirds, avoidance of construction of OWFs at the important foraging area and migratory rout, and adaptive management including turning off turbines during breeding and migrating season are required.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,0285-4376,,,,,,,,,,,"Hokkaido Univ, Grad Sch Fisheries Sci, Sapporo, Hokkaido, Japan",,,,2018-03-01,ZOOREC:ZOOR15403015069,,

Hence, the electrification solution usually considered is based on expensive, though often unreliable, stand-alone systems, mainly small diesel-electric generators. Hybrid wind-diesel power systems are among the most interesting and environmental friendly technological alternatives for the electrification of remote consumers, presenting also increased reliability. More precisely, a hybrid wind-diesel installation, based on an appropriate combination of a small diesel-electric generator and a micro-wind converter, offsets the significant capital cost of the wind turbine and the high operational cost of the diesel-electric generator. In this context, the present study concentrates on a detailed energy production cost analysis in order to estimate the optimum configuration of a wind-diesel-battery stand-alone system used to guarantee the energy autonomy of a typical remote consumer. Accordingly, the influence of the governing parameters-such as wind potential, capital cost, oil price, battery price and first installation cost-on the corresponding electricity production cost is investigated using the developed model. Taking into account the results obtained, hybrid wind-diesel systems may be the most cost-effective electrification solution for numerous isolated consumers located in suitable (average wind speed higher than 6.0 m/s) wind potential regions.

Moreover, this new framework requires the non conventional power sources and power converter-based systems to be responsible for the duties traditionally carried out by conventional synchronous generators as frequency support. This paper presents how different power-electronic based technologies can provide frequency support individually and in a coordinated manner (with different priority given by the deadbands) ensuring a stable operation. The implemented scenarios examine challenging conditions, where the primary reserve of the interconnected conventional, renewable, and storage generation is fully utilized to tackle frequency incidents. This demonstrates how the joint regulation of the power electronic-based technologies enhances the frequency stability of the AC synchronous areas. The different control schemes and their interaction are investigated in Cigre DC grid benchmark adapted for frequency stability studies and implemented in Matlab/Simulink simulation tool.

The wind farm consists of 32 Senvion 6XM152 turbines. The installation took place between August 2019 and May 2020. An offshore wind turbine undergoing installation is interesting from a research point of view for several reasons: Simple geometry: turbine foundation and tower are both rotationally symmetric steel tubes. Rotational symmetry also leads to (approximate) isotrope structural characteristics in the plane normal to tower and foundation. High Reynolds number flow: Assuming a tower diameter of 6 m, and average wind speeds ranging from 5 m/s to 12 m/s under installation conditions, Reynolds numbers range from 4.5 million to 10.5 million. Wave loading und full scale conditions. Practical relevance to improving the competability of offshore wind. For fluid mechanics, closely monitoring offshore wind turbines under wind and wave loading thus compares to a full scale experiment. Monitoring 32 turbines undergoing installation thus enables the measurement a broad spectrum of different states. The investigation into the data isongoing, questions and contributions are welcome. The current data release still does not include all data. The dataset will thus be updated again in the future with more data to come.First analytic results can be found here: Sander, A, Haselsteiner, AF, Barat, K, Janssen, M, Oelker, S, Ohlendorf, J, and Thoben, K.

[less than]https://generalconferencefiles.s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/eurodyn_2020_ebook_procedings_vol1.pdf[greater than] Physical Background An offshore wind turbine under installation conditions can be simplified as a cantlivered beam (circular cross section, rotationally symmetric wall thickness) with an eccentric mass(nacelle with generator) vibrating transversally (fore-aft and side-side in the reference system of the nacelle) under wind and wave loads. Both wind and wave loads are stochastic and are described using statistical models. Wave loads are a function of the sea state. For a sea states, the most important parameters are significant wave heigh H_m0 and Wave peak period T_P. To a lesser extend, wave direction, zero upcrossing period and maximum wave height are also important. Different statistical models can be used to describe the sea state and the relationship between significant wave heigh H_m0 and wave peak period. Most prominent in the North Sea is the JONSWAP spectrum. Wind loads are depending on wind speed, wind direction, shear factor and turbulence intensity. Different statistical models are available to describe the wind spectrum. Wind and wave loads trigger a structural response of the turbine. The structural response depends on the loading spectrum as well as the transfer function. Furthermore the structural response is strongly depending on damping and elasticity of the structure. In turbines, damping is typically very low (~ 0.5 - 1.5 %). The response is dominated by the first Eigenfrequency of the turbine. As the turbine is assumed to be rotationally symmetric, the fore-aft and side-side mode are extremely close together if not indistinguishable [1]. The response has the characteristics of a narrow-band random vibration. A narrow-band random vibration is characterized by being dominated by a single, narrow frequency peak (here: first Eigenfrequency). The amplitude envelope follows a Rayleigh distribution and the phase angle is equally distributed between 0 and 2 pi. If viewed from above, the structural response describes a closed curve (orbit) which can be characterized by it shape (eccentricity), mean amplitude and direction. Mathematically speaking, this is a lissajous-figure, where the time series from one response direction is plotted as a function of the time series of the second response direction. [1]: under installation condition Experimental Setup Several locations were used to record data during the installation of the wind farm. They are listed in the following table: helihoist-{1,2}:data recorded from the helicopter hoisting platform atop the turbine nacelle. For most installations, two sensor boxes were deployed to ensure data availability. tp:Measurements from the transition piece sbitroot:Measurements from the blade lifting yoke's blade root side. The Z-axis is aligned to the blade main axis, X-Axis is perpendicular. sbittip:Measurements from the tip side of the blade lifting yoke. Z-axis aligned with the blade main axis, X-axis perpendicular damper:Measurements from the tuned mass damper used during single blade installation towertop:measurements from inside the turbine tower at the upper lift plattform towertransfer: measurements from atop the towers during sail out from the base harbour to the installation site Organization of data For each turbine installation, a separate folder can be found, e.g. turbine-01 for the first and turbine-16 for the 16th turbine. Turbine numbering follows the order of installation. Different data sources are organized in subfolders for each turbine dataset. Unfortunately, not every data source is available for each turbine. Data sources are roughly sorted into categories. The following table lists these categories: location / tom : data from custom build sensor boxes. Data includes acceleration, angular acceleration, magnetic field, gnss recording and rough estimates of the eulerian angles. waves / wmb-sued :Sea state statistics for the installatin period of the turbine. waves / fino :Sea state statistics from the german research platform FINO1located approx. 6 km from the installation site. waves / waveradar :Sea state statstics, recorded by a wave rider wave laser. wind / lidar :high fidelity wind data recorded on the installation vessel during the installation of the wind farm. wind / scada :10 min. mean wind statistisc recorded on wind turbines in the vicinity of the installation site. This data is used in case no LIDAR data is available. wind / anemometer :During some of the installations, anemometers were present on the installation vessel. These recordings are sorted into this sub-subfolder. wind / fino :Additonal wind statistics recorded by the FINO research station. Least recommended for investigations, as these recordings were taken approx. 6 km from the installation site. The zenodo data set includes 16 zip archives (for 16 turbines) as well as one zip archive including environmental data.

These Sensor Boxes were initially designed to measure accelerations and GPS tracks of offshore wind turbine towers undergoing installation. During the installation of the wind farm Trianel Windpark Borkum II they were subsequentially used to track the complete installation with a focus on single blade installation Data from the TOM devices comes as CSV files. The firmware of the boxes was designed, such that data was written into 10 MB sized txt files instead of one large txt file in order to circumvent data corruption due to power loss. However, this leads to a few milliseconds of missing data between log files. Additionally, jitter due to IO-Operations is present in the data as well and data should under all circumstance be resampled befor further analysis. Parameters provided by the TOM devices are listed in the following: epoch :machine readable time stamp based on the unix epoch in UTC [s] runtime : time since last boot of the tom device [ms] latitude : Degrees latitude in decimal writing. For Trianel: [degree due North] longitude :Degrees longitude in decimal writing. For Trianel: [degree due East] elevation :elevation above mean sea level [m] rot_{x,y,z} :Rotational acceleration around the three cartesian axis {x,y,z} of the TOM box. [degree / s^2] acc_{x,y,z} :linear acceleration in each of the three cartesian axis {x,y,z} in the reference system of the TOM box [m/s^2] mag_{x,y,z} :magnetic field strength in each of the local cartesian TOM box axis {x,y,z} [micro-Tesla] roll :eulerian roll angle (angle around the x Axis of the tom box) [degree] pitch :eulerian pitch angle (angle around the y Axis of the tom box) [degree] yaw :eulerian yaw angle (angle around the z Axis of the tom box) [degree] LIDAR wind data description A Leosphere WindCube LIDAR was mounted on the installation vessel Tailleventto record the atmospheric boundary layer during installation.The data recorded by the lidar was exported as csvs and provided by the vessel operator. The raw data includes the following parameters epoch :time stamp as a unix epoch in UTC [s] wind_speed_N :The wind speed at the N'th return level [m/s] wind_dir_N :Wind direction at the N'th return level in the vessels reference frame [degree] wind_dir_N_corr :Wind direction at the N'th return level due North [degree due North] heigh_N :The height of the lidar return level [m] Data is resampled to a 1 s return interval. wave data description Wave data was recorded using a waverider wave buoy (DWR-G). The wave rider buoy was located at 54 00' 238'' degree North and 6 26' 553'' degree East. In decimals: 54.0031096 North, 6.4425532 East.Based on the raw data, sea state statistics were derived with a return period of 30 minutes. The data comes as csv, column oriented text files. The first line entails parameter names and units and is commented out by a hashbang (unix commentary). The data is a combination of two different data files as provided by the buoy: \*.HIS Data Text File (History of Spectrum parameters) and \*.HIW Data Text File (History of Wave Statistics). This results in the two timestamps in the data file because history of wave statistics data is available immediately after each measurement time period, whereas history of spectrum parameters take approx. 5 minutes to calculate by the buoy and thus have a slightly later time stamp.

However, the chronic physiological effects of continuous exposure to weak noise, i.e. the operation noise from offshore wind farms (OWF), remain unclear. Since more and more OWF will be built in the near future, their operation noise is an emerging ecological issue. To investigate the long-term physiological effects of such underwater noise on fish, black porgies (Acanthopagrus schlegelii) were exposed to two types of simulated wind farm noise-quiet (QC: 109 dB re 1 mu Pa / 125.4 Hz; approx. 100 m away from the wind turbine) and noisy (NC: 138 dB re 1 mu Pa / 125.4 Hz; near the turbine)-for up to 2 weeks. Measurement of auditory-evoked potentials showed that black porgies can hear sound stimuli under both NC and QC scenarios. Although no significant difference was found in plasma cortisol levels, the fish under NC conditions exhibited higher plasma reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels than the control group at week 2. Moreover, alterations were found in mRNA levels of hepatic antioxidant-related genes (sod1, cat and gpx), with cat downregulated and gpx upregulated after one week of QC exposure. Our results suggest that the black porgy may adapt to QC levels of noise by modulating the antioxidant system to keep ROS levels low. However, such antioxidant response was not observed under NC conditions; instead, ROS accumulated to measurably higher levels. This study suggests that continuous OWF operation noise represents a potential stressor to fish. Furthermore, this is the first study to demonstrate that chronic exposure to noise could induce ROS accumulation in fish plasma.",,,,,,,,,6,2,0,0,6,0,6,,,1021-5506,1810-522X,,,,,,,,,,"Natl Taiwan Ocean Univ, Inst Marine Biol, Keelung 202, TaiwanJapan Agcy Marine Earth Sci & Technol, Dept Marine Biodivers Res, Yokosuka, Kanagawa 2370061, JapanKagoshima Univ, Fisheries Dept, Kaogoshima 8900056, JapanNatl Taiwan Ocean Univ, Ctr Excellence Oceans, Keelung 202, Taiwan",Kagoshima Univ,,,2019-01-04,WOS:000453509500001,31966299,

In this context, the present paper aims to estimate the large-scale offshore wind production of the Mediterranean Sea. The methodology uses an open GIS platform and considers bathymetric data, annual average wind speed data, environmental data, turbines technical characteristics and administrative information. Three depth categories have been considered. The overlap between depth categories and annual average wind speeds ranges has allowed to determine the areas potentially suitable for wind farms allocation. On the basis of optimal wind farm layouts and of the characteristic of the type of turbines considered, the theoretical maximum annual offshore wind production has been estimated for whole Mediterranean area and it is about 742 TWh/year.

The portable renewable energy system consists of a 46.5 m(2) (500 ft(2)) tent powered by a suite of renewable energy technologies including a hybrid wind and photovoltaic system with a lithium-iron-phosphate (LiFePO4) battery bank for energy storage. Thin-film photovoltaic panels integrated into the thermal fly of the tent are designed to generate 4.8 kW of power. In addition, the system consists of two wind turbines each capable of generating 1 kW, and are supported on portable towers which do not require guy wires or mountings into the ground. The system provides 3 kW of power continuously with a maximum renewable energy power generation of 6.8 kW. The Mobile Medical Clinic (MMC) was deployed in Mao, Dominican Republic. Due to the environmental conditions at this particular location a majority of the power generated by the renewable energy system came from the photovoltaic panels. The renewable energy system and energy storage system are backed up by a gasoline generator, which serves solely as a source of power in the absence of wind or solar energy and when the battery bank is discharged. The control system of the MMC automatically turns on and shuts off the generator as needed in order to minimize fuel consumption. The entire MMC including the renewable energy system was designed to be portable, scalable and all components man-liftable. The system is controlled by state-of-the-art off the shelf components and does not require a complex computer control system. The control system consists solely of the inverters and the charge controllers. The system has remained extremely effective and yet simple to operate which is beneficial since the purpose of the MMC is to operate in austere conditions with minimal training for the operators. The system has been donated to the Dominican Republic to be used for deployment during emergency response situations. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

In order to accurately estimate the fatigue life of a platform, coupled aerodynamic-hydrodynamic simulations are performed to obtain dynamic stress values. The simulations are performed at a multitude of representative environmental states, or bins, which can mimic the conditions the structure may endure at a given site, per ABS Floating Offshore Wind Turbine Installation guidelines. To accurately represent the variety of wind and wave conditions, the number of environmental states can be of the order of 103. Unlike other offshore structures, both the wind and wave conditions must be accounted for, which are generally considered independent parameters, drastically increasing the number of states. The stress timeseries from these simulations can be used to estimate the damage at a particular location on the structure by using commonly accepted methods, such as the rainflow counting algorithm. The damage due to either the winds or the waves can be estimated by using a frequency decomposition of the stress timeseries.In this paper, a similar decoupled approach is used to attempt to recover the damages induced from these coupled simulations. Although it is well-known that a coupled, aero-hydro analysis is necessary in order to accurately simulate the nonlinear rigid-body motions of the platform, it is less clear if the same statement could be made about the fatigue properties of the platform. In one approach, the fatigue damage equivalent load is calculated independently from both scatter diagrams of the waves and a rose diagram of the wind. De-coupled simulations are performed to estimate the response at an all-encompassing range of environmental conditions. A database of responses based on these environmental conditions is constructed. The likelihood of occurrence at a case-study site is used to compare the damage equivalent from the coupled simulations. The 005 platform in the Borssele wind farm zone is used as a case-study and the damage equivalent load from the de-coupled methods are compared to those from the coupled analysis in order to assess these methodologies.",,,,,1st International Offshore Wind Technical Conference1st International Offshore Wind Technical Conference,"NOV 04-07, 2018NOV 04-07, 2018","ASME, Ocean Offshore & Arctic Engn DivASME, Ocean Offshore & Arctic Engn Div","San Francisco, CASan Francisco, CA",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,978-0-7918-5197-5,,,,,,,,,"Principle Power Inc, Emeryville, CA 94608 USA",Principle Power Inc,,,2018-01-01,WOS:000474938500029,,

Harbour porpoises are occuring in high densities west of Sylt and north of Borkum. Except one there are no wind farms planned. During the establishment of the wind mill foundations harbour porpoises are usually dispelled, but these temporary works do not lead to a complete loss of their habitats. More than 100,000 birds regularly use this region as passage migrants. As an impact of wind farms these resting places will be disturbed. But to a limited scale resting birds are able to swerve and find other places, if the area affected is not a highly frequented resting place. The migrating birds use the coastal zone more intensively than offshore areas. Simultaneous mass migration of birds takes place only a few days each year. The birds use different flying heights - lower in the offshore-area than near the coast. Barrier-effects and collisions caused by offshore windfarms must be expected. It is still not possible to predict the number of bird collisions likely to occur at all wind farms proposed. An early warning system, compatible illumination and a concept to switch off the wind mills in times of massive migration could help to avoid bird collision.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,0940-6808,,,,,,,,,,,"Planungsgemeinschaft Marienau, Neetzetalstr 13, D-21368 Dahlem, Germany",,,,2011-12-09,BCI:BCI201200008096,,

Because siting bottom-mounted turbines in most nearshore coastal zones is either impractical or politically difficult, turbine developers are testing floating-platform turbine technologies for deeper waters. Deepwater, floating-platform turbines have the advantages of being sited in the highest quality winds farther offshore, movable if desired, and located beyond the horizon, out of sight from shore. This paper reports on conversations with 103 coastal stakeholders at community meetings regarding development and testing of floating turbines off the coast of Maine, U.S.A. Using naturalistic field methods, this essay reports common questions and concerns of commercial lobstermen, fishermen, and coastal civic leaders. Early-stage conversations suggest that once coastal community members understand the benefits and impacts of wind farm development on their quality of life, many share specific preferences for where offshore developments could be located. Citizens' remarks are sophisticated, nuanced, and innovative and include robust ideas for pairing turbine siting with fishery conservation. Findings imply that when looking to site offshore turbines in public, multiple-use ocean spaces, developers, planners, and coastal communities should engage early and often in two-way conversation rather than one-way outreach.

Within the Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ), the responsibility for the monitoring of marine vertebrates belongs to the Federal Ministry for the Environment, Nature Conservation and Nuclear Safety (BMU) and the Federal Agency for Nature Conservation (BfN). The monitoring of seabirds and marine mammals is performed by means of different line transect methods. The following monitoring techniques have been applied: ship and aircraft observer- based methods as well as airborne digital monitoring methods. So far, most of the vertebrate monitoring in German waters has been performed by means of the airborne observer-based method. The great advantage of this method is that large marine areas can be surveyed in a time and cost-efficient manner. With the expansion of offshore wind farms in the German North Sea and the Baltic, this monitoring method has been banned from offshore wind farm areas due to safety concerns of the low altitudes required to perform them effectively. Aircraft-based digital monitoring methods represent a safe alternative for monitoring tasks in these areas since they can take place from a higher altitude and thus the collision risk with wind turbines can be mitigated. Currently, a range of digital camera systems as well as different image analysis processes are used to monitor seabirds and marine mammals within German offshore wind farm areas.

At the same time, offshore wind industry has taken the great leap towards the ocean. Such wind farms hold more and more wind turbines (>100), depths increase leaving shallow waters (almost 100 m deep), and the power installed is increasing at a dramatic rate not thought to be possible only one decade ago (currently reaching 400 MW). These facts are ones of the great advances of the XXI century, but so far, it has not been done a deep reflection on the impact of the offshore wind on the aforementioned SDG, and on how the offshore wind is going to accomplish all the challenges happening when trying to reach such SDG. The achievement of some of the SDG and the offshore wind technology progress go, with no doubt, hand in hand. This is the case of Goal 12 (Responsible consumption and production), Goal 13 (Climate action), or Goal 14 (Life below water). But there are also other SDG that deserve a special attention, in order to ensure that offshore wind power technology effectively will contribute to reach them, and will not, on the contrary, act to the detriment of them. This is the case of Goal 7 (Affordable and clean energy), Goal 8 (Decent work and economic growth), or Goal 10 (Reducing inequalities). In this paper, the great contribution of the offshore wind technology to achieve the SDG is commented, making special emphasis on the possible weaknesses that could appear, and on how to solve them.

A numerical model was developed to capture the relevant physics from the dynamic interaction between different turbines coupled to a common hydraulic network and controller. This paper presents two examples of the time-domain simulation results for an hypothetical hydraulic wind farm subject to turbulent wind conditions. The performance and operational parameters of individual turbines are compared with those of a reference wind farm with conventional technology turbines, using the same wind farm layout and environmental conditions. For the presented case study, results indicate that the individual wind turbines are able to operate within operational limits with the current pressure control concept.

While less is known about how people will respond to offshore than onshore wind, there is now an emerging body of research. From this literature, several common factors which influence responses have emerged and are discussed here: the (continued) role of visual impact; place attachment to the local area; lack of tangible benefits; relationships with developers and outsiders; and the role of the planning and decision-making systems. The paper argues that, as with onshore developments, the public should be included in decision-making about offshore wind farms, and that they have a key role which should not be underestimated. The paper concludes with some thoughts about the means to involve people and how effected communities might be effectively acknowledged, identified and engaged. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Monopiles must resist lateral loads and overturning moments because of environmental (wind and wave) actions, whereas vertical loads tend to be comparatively small. Recent developments in turbine sizes and increases in hub heights have resulted in pile diameters increasing rapidly, whereas the embedment length to diameter ratio (L/D) is reducing. Soil erosion around piles, termed scour, changes the soil strength and stiffness properties and affects the system's load resistance characteristics. In practice, design scour depths of up to 1.3D are routinely assumed during the turbine lifetime; however, the impact on monopiles with low L/D is not yet fully understood. In this article, centrifuge tests are performed to assess the effect of scour on the performance of piles with low L/D. In particular, the effect of combined loads, scour type (global, local), and depth are considered. A loading system is developed that enables application of realistic load eccentricity and combined vertical, horizontal, and moment loading at the seabed level. An instrumented 1.8-m-diameter pile with L/D = 5 is used. A friction-reducing ball-type connection is designed to transfer lateral loads to the pile without inducing any rotational pile-head constraint, which is associated with loading rigs in tests of this nature. Results suggest that vertical and lateral load interaction is minimal. Scour has a significant impact on the lateral load-bearing capacity and stiffness of the pile, leads to increases in bending moment magnitude along the pile shaft, and lowers the location of peak pile bending moment. The response varies with scour type, with global scour resulting in larger moments than local scour. The size of the local scour hole is found to have a significant impact on the pile response, suggesting that scour hole width should be explicitly considered in design.",,,,,,,,,28,0,0,0,2,0,28,,,0149-6115,1945-7545,,,,,,,,,,"Delft Univ Technol, Dept Civil Engn & Geosci, Bldg 23,Stevinweg 1,POB 5048, NL-2600 GA Delft, NetherlandsUniv Nottingham, Fac Engn, Dept Civil Engn, Nottingham NG7 2RD, EnglandDelft Univ Technol, Dept Civil Engn & Geosci, Bldg 23,Stevinweg 1,POB 5048, NL-2628 CN Delft, Netherlands",,,,2020-09-08,WOS:000562115300002,,

The present numerical model is compared with available physical experimental data to determine its capability of simulating the WSSI around pile structures.

The government of Pakistan has already forsaken the task to produce power at a national level and has sublet this job to independent power producers. The prime investments of Pakistani people are in the real estate business with private real estate giants operating in the country. In this research, a net-zero energy housing society (NZEHS) has been analyzed in the future economic hub, the city of Gwadar at the Arabian Sea. Abundant renewable resources are available at Gwadar city with a global horizontal irradiance of 5.19 kWh/m(2) day and an average wind speed of 5.19 m/s. A combination of photovoltaic (PV) and wind turbines has been selected with installed capacities of 32.2 MW and 25.5 MW, respectively, to generate energies of 55.9 GWh and 49.0 GWh annually for an electrical load of 101.3 GWh. The net present cost of the system is 149 Million US$ with a Levelized cost of energy of 7.91 CUS$/kWh. The capital cost for this project is 92.4 Million US$. In this NZEHS, each customer must pay 0.0132 MUS$ to get free electricity for 25 years with a simple payback of 4.78 years and a discounted payback period of 5.79 years.

This project will establish and evaluate a design feedback process which can protect and perhaps enhance the natural environment, whilst allowing energy extraction to be maximised.Engineers will work with project and device developers to establish approriate development scenarios which will then be considered using state of the art modelling techniques to assess the levels of ecological impact across a range of key ecological parameters. This modelling will establish the levels of impact and the sensitivity of key impacts to changes in array and device design parameters. Stakeholders will be involved in assessing the acceptablity of predicted ecological changes and the prospects of ecological benefit being enhanced.The process loop will be completed by feeding the impact analysis findings back into the array design process to start a further iteration of the design, impact and acceptability assessment process.It is anticipated that typically three iterations will be needed for the development scanarios to establish and refine the process to the benefit of the broader marine energy sector.This project crosses borders from research led-engineering design, offshore engineering and marine operations to ecological science, measurement and physical modelling expertise within the consortium. The parallels between wind and wet renewable will be utilised to link from early development shallow water wind and tidal streams to floating wave and wind in deeper water. The consortium will engage with Marine Scotland and MMO from the start of the project and at key intervals through the project.The project will proceed by interactive collaboration between: system designers; physical modellers and ecologists; regulators and project developers.Appropriate response models will be established based upon direct involvement and interaction with cutting edge research being conducted within NERC, EPSRC; ETI and CEC funded research programmes. A clear imperative for the first stage is to refine the choice of criterion from which to judge environmental benefit, particularly when upscaling, e.g. fisheries enhancement, acoustics, animal movement corridors.These will then be used by the physical and ecological modellers to produce a series of configuration scenarios.The engineering specialists in the project will identify portfolios of appropriate case studies of array developments and state of the art array modelling tools. Case studies will be developed and interpreted using the techniques established above . The engagement of developers, trade associations, EMEC and Wave Hub is fundamental for specialist input and dissemination and the results will be interpreted in association with these broader stakeholder communities. This will be through workshops arranged to coordinate structured debate and cross consortium feedback.This process will be, fundamentally an iterative procedure, with effective closure of the design, ecological assessment and constraint quantification process loop requiring multiple circuits prior to acceptable compromises being reached.Management PlanA steering committee drawn from the investigators and incorporating representatives from wind, wave and tidal developers and invited representatives from the regulators will assess and guide progress.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,NE/J004057/1,,,,,,,,Loughborough University,,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:15304828,,

Further, wind power plants constitute habitats for a number of organisms, and may locally alter assemblage composition and biomass of invertebrates, algae and fish. In this study, fouling assemblages on offshore wind turbines were compared to adjacent hard substrate. Influences of the structures on the seabed were also investigated. The turbines differed significantly from adjacent boulders in terms of assemblage composition of epibiota and motile invertebrates. Species number and Shannon-Wiener diversity were, also, significantly lower on the wind power plants. It was also indicated that the turbines might have affected assemblages of invertebrates and algae on adjacent boulders. Off shore wind power plant offer atypical substrates for fouling assemblages in terms of orientation, depth range, structure, and surface texture. Some potential ecological implications of the addition of these non-natural habitats for coastal ecology are discussed. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Visual monitoring of harbour porpoises was conducted prior to as well as during construction and operation by means of 15 aerial line transect distance sampling surveys, from 2008 to 2010. Static acoustic monitoring (SAM) with echolocation click loggers at 12 positions was performed additionally from 2008 to 2011. SAM devices were deployed between 1 and 50 km from the centre of the wind farm. During aerial surveys, 18 600 km of transect lines were covered in two survey areas (10 934 and 11 824 km(2)) and 1392 harbour porpoise sightings were recorded. Lowest densities were documented during the construction period in 2009. The spatial distribution pattern recorded on two aerial surveys three weeks before and exactly during pile-driving points towards a strong avoidance response within 20 km distance of the noise source. Generalized additive modelling of SAM data showed a negative impact of pile-driving on relative porpoise detection rates at eight positions at distances less than 10.8 km. Increased detection rates were found at two positions at 25 and 50 km distance suggesting that porpoises were displaced towards these positions. A pile-driving related behavioural reaction could thus be detected using SAM at a much larger distance than a pure avoidance radius would suggest. The first waiting time (interval between porpoise detections of at least 10 min), after piling started, increased with longer piling durations. A gradient in avoidance, a gradual fading of the avoidance reaction with increasing distance from the piling site, is hence most probably a product of an incomplete displacement during shorter piling events.",,,,,,,,,139,1,0,0,114,0,145,,,1748-9326,,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Vet Med Hannover, Inst Terr & Aquat Wildlife Res, D-25761 Busum, GermanyGerman Oceanog Museum, D-18439 Stralsund, Germany",German Oceanog Museum,,,2013-08-07,WOS:000321425100049,,

To prevent potentially dangerous situations or incidents, guidelines for the physical aptitude testing of offshore employees in Germany and other European countries have been developed. However, these criteria have not been previously empirically tested for validity. Although an important component of occupational health and safety, such aptitude testing should not lead to the unjustified exclusion of potential employees.MethodsHeart rate (HR) and oxygen consumption ((V) over dotO(2)) measurements of 23 male offshore employees and trainers were taken during typical field activities, within the framework of mandatory training exercises. These were evaluated in relation to the individual maximum values of the subjects, determined by cycle spiroergometry.ResultsFor the training modules, average HR and (V) over dotO(2) values of approximately 40% and 33-48% of the maximum values, respectively, were found. Furthermore, 65% of the participants achieved average HR values that exceeded 30% of their individual heart rate reserve and 45% had (V) over dotO(2) values above 35% of their individual (V) over dotO(2,max).ConclusionOur preliminary results show that offshore work is a form of heavy physical labor, thereby justifying the criteria put forth in the various fitness to work guidelines. We propose that more in-depth investigations should be performed, incorporating task-specific fitness testing as well as higher level aspects of work safety and security, including effective communication skills and teamwork. We also recommend a re-evaluation of the current limits for physical work provided in the literature. The results of such studies could then be applied to other aptitude tests, thereby strengthening the evidence for such measures.",,,,,,,,,13,0,0,0,3,0,13,,,0340-0131,1432-1246,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Med Ctr Hamburg Eppendorf, Inst Occupat & Maritime Med ZfAM, Seewartenstr 10, D-20459 Hamburg, Germany",,,,2019-04-10,WOS:000462612100006,30506444,

Marine Ornithology 39: 123-128.Modified X-band marine radar was used to quantify flight heights, passage rates and flight behavior of Marbled Murrelets Brachyramphus marmoratus on the Olympic Peninsula, Washington, and to assess the collision risk associated with future coastal wind developments. Over three mornings, 287 height observations were collected for targets matching murrelet speed, flight height and density on radar. Mean height above ground level was 246 (SE 4.7) m. The lowest murrelet-type target detected was at 62 in, while the highest was recorded at 663 m. Fifty percent of murrelet-type targets were detected between 196 m and 286 m. A maximum-likelihood model of flight heights estimated that 4.6% of murrelets were flying at or below the average wind turbine rotor-swept height of 130.5 m as the birds transited to and from nest sites. From the same model, it was estimated that 0.5% and 0.01% of birds, respectively, were flying at or below the heights of typical communication towers and transmission lines. These data comprise three days of sampling at a single location, and thus may not be representative of height distributions found in other sites or regions. Flight heights likely vary with topography, distance from the ocean, weather, and other factors, and thus the proportion of birds flying below turbine height likely varies both spatially and temporally. Additional data on murrelet flight heights are now being collected to determine how the relative risk of collision changes with topography and weather conditions. This information should help predict the risk of collision with artificial structures, including wind energy developments that may pose a risk to murrelets.",,,,,,,,,6,0,0,0,6,0,7,,,1018-3337,2074-1235,,,,,,,,,,"Hamer Environm LP, POB 2561, Mt Vernon, WA 98273 USA",,,,2011-01-01,BCI:BCI201100673157,,

The NSI Renewable Energy Group has focused their project management expertise in three types of renewable energy: Off-Shore Wind Turbines (OSWTs); Current/Tide Energy Converters (C/TECs); and Wave Energy Converters (WECs). Solar energy is an area of planned expansion for the group. This paper includes an outline of the NSI Renewable Energy Group project management approach for WEC projects, a discussion of various wave energy technologies, including their states of development and commercialization potential, non-grid connected applications for WECs are discussed including distributed generation, powering desalination plants, hydrogen generation, and beach erosion abatement.The NSI Wave Renewable Energy Group consists of experts in weather and wave modeling, environmental permitting, WEC performance modeling for project specific siting plans, and economic modeling, to determine an accurate forecast of the project cost of energy and internal rate of return. NSI uses the Distributed Integrated Ocean Prediction System (DIOPS) to estimate the wave energy in the customer's area of interest, to determine the ocean wave energy resource potential available for a particular customer. DIOPS allows for deep-water waves to be propagated across ocean basins, using the WAve Model (WAM), over the shelf, using a variety of nearshore wave models including, Delft Hydraulics Simulating Waves Nearshore (SWAN), the Steady-state WAVE model (STWAVE), and the REFraction/DIFfraction model (REF/DIF). DIOPS can also propagate the resultant wave spectra into the surf zone, via the Navy Standard Surf Model (NSSM). Using an extensive database of WEC developers, NSI is able to determine the optimum performing and economically efficient WECs, which can be employed in the customer's operating area. At the same time, NSI has personnel experienced in obtaining the necessary environmental permits for installing the best performing WEC, that conforms to the environmental sensitivities of the area. By using existing commercial technologies, and applying them to the customer's need, NSI is able to develop green energy solutions, which meet both the customer's power requirements and monetary budgets.",,,,,MTS/IEEE Oceans 2002 ConferenceMTS/IEEE Oceans 2002 Conference,"OCT 29-31, 2002OCT 29-31, 2002",Marine Technol Soc; IEEE; OESMarine Technol Soc; IEEE; OES,"BILOXI, MSBILOXI, MS",5,0,0,0,0,0,5,,,,,0-7803-7534-3,,,,,,,,,"Neptune Sci Inc, Renewable Energy Grp, Barnett Ctr, San Diego, CA 92110 USA",Neptune Sci Inc,,,2002-01-01,WOS:000182293200253,,

The S. spinulosa reefs were identified in the acoustic data as areas of distinct irregular texturing. Maps created using acoustic data were validated using quantitative measures of reef quality, namely tube density (as a proxy for the density of live S. spinulosa), percentage cover of S. spinulosa structures (both living and dead) and associated macrofauna derived from seabed images taken across the development site. Statistically significant differences were observed in all physical measures of S. spinulosa as well the number (S) and diversity (H') of associated species, derived from seabed images classified according to the presence or absence of reef, validating the use of high resolution sidescan sonar to map these important biogenic habitats. High precision mapping in the early stages allowed for the micro-siting of wind turbines in a way that caused minimal damage to S. spinulosa reefs during construction. These habitats have since recovered and expanded in extent. The surveys undertaken at the Thanet Offshore Windfarm site demonstrate the importance of repeat mapping for this emerging industry, allowing habitat enhancement to be attributed to the development whilst preventing background habitat degradation from being wrongly attributed to the development.

To tap the vast resource in deep water sites, new support structures, such as those that float, are needed. For floating structures to succeed, they must withstand the offshore wind and wave environment. Two new methods for controlling a floating turbine and reducing the platform and blade loads are presented. The first is a method for controlling collective blade pitch and reducing platform pitch motion, a significant problem for floating structures. The rated generator speed is made a function of the platform pitch velocity. When the platform is pitching upwind, the set point generator speed is set to a larger value, and vice versa. For constant generator torque, this approach essentially makes the rated power a variable that depends on the platform pitch velocity. Fundamentally, this control approach trades power variability for platform pitch variability. The results will show substantial reductions in platform pitch motion but minor increases in power variability. Second, an individual blade pitch controller (IPC) designed to reduce blade fatigue loads is implemented for a floating turbine. The IPC approach is commonly utilized for reducing the 1P fatigue loads on the blades. The goal of implementing this IPC approach is to investigate how traditional load reduction control, which is successful for onshore turbines, integrates and performs with floating turbines. The results will demonstrate the unique challenge of reducing blade loads on a floating turbine.",,,,,,,,,82,11,0,0,1,0,96,,,0309-524X,2048-402X,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Massachusetts, Dept Mech & Ind Engn, 160 Governors Dr, Amherst, MA 01003 USA",,,,2009-12-01,WOS:000210772000002,,

Because single fixed locations are often used to assess annual recruitment, the intra-annual dynamics of ingress across multiple sites often remains unresolved. To address this question, plankton nets and eel collectors were deployed weekly to synoptically quantify early stage Anguilla rostrata abundance at 12 sites across two New Jersey estuaries over an ingress season. Numbers of early-stage glass eels collected at the inlet mouths were moderately variable within and between estuaries over time and showed evidence for weak lunar phase and water temperature correlations. The relative condition of glass eels, although highly variable, declined significantly over the ingress season and indicated a tendency for lower condition A. rostrata to colonize sites in the lower estuary. Accumulations of glass eels and early-stage elvers retrieved from collectors (one to > 1500 A. rostrata per collector) at lower estuary sites were highly variable over time, producing only weak correlations between estuaries. By way of contrast, development into late-stage elvers, coupled with the large-scale colonization of up-river sites, was highly synchronized between and within estuaries and contingent on water temperatures reaching c. 10-12 degrees C. Averaged over the ingress season, abundance estimates were remarkably consistent between paired sites across estuaries, indicating a low degree of interestuary variability.

We analyzed the effect of WPPs on movement patterns of sea eagles in Germany with satellite telemetry. We analyzed ranging behavior and environmental parameters that influence the behavioral flight response to WPPs using multiple regression models. During 2003 through 2009 we radio-tracked 25 white-tailed sea eagles in northern Germany (8 territorial, 7 non-territorial, 10 young eagles marked as nestlings). Mean home range sizes of territorial eagles varied with individuals tracked and the estimation method applied, ranging from 2.7km(2) to 669.7km(2). Sex or breeding status did not influence home range size. Ranging behavior varied between individuals and was correlated with habitat quality (i.e., nest distance to nearest water source and to anthropgogenic structure) and weather conditions. Among the 9 territorial eagles, only 1 individual resided within the officially proposed 3-km minimum safety distance between nest and planned WPP. However, others frequently moved >3km away from their nests, leaving the proposed safety area. One eagle inhabiting a territory within intensively cultivated landscape frequently approached a WPP and did not alter its movement patterns near the WPP compared to control areas. We identified several features visited by the eagles (e.g., perches, small lakes). To mitigate the collision risk of eagles, the recommended safety radius of 3km between nest and WPP should become an international standard with a safe flight corridor to feeding grounds. To avoid frequent collisions at the population scale with WPPs, it is important to construct WPPs only outside the main distribution areas of white-tailed sea eagles.

Wearable harvesters that collect energy from the environment are a promising technology to achieve the long-life goal for truly wearable devices. However, most of the mature energy harvesting approaches usually imply an outdoor setting, using solar panels, wind turbines or high-frequency vibration as energy sources. In particular, most kinetic harvesters are not effective with human motion frequencies and mobility patterns. In this paper, we evaluate and integrate a highly-efficient kinetic harvester circuit to power autonomous wearable devices, exploiting the energy gathered from human motion. For this purpose, a Kinetron Micro Generator System 26.4 (MSG) has been characterized, conversion circuits have been designed and evaluated using off-the-shelf components. The implemented kinetic harvesting system successfully manages to harvest energy from human movements and stores it in small supercapacitors or batteries. Experimental results show that it is possible to harvest up to 280 mu J from a single small human movement and up to 1.1J per-day using a passive rectifier. This results in up to 180 mu J for single burst of energy and 0.7J per-day stored energy in a battery following a direct current conversion. These are extremely promising results for small wearable kinetic harvesting, and demonstrate that this new generation of kinetic energy harvesters can be instrumental in the design of many self-sustainable wearable devices.",,,,,"International Symposium on Power Electronics, Electrical Drives, Automation, and Motion (SPEEDAM)International Symposium on Power Electronics, Electrical Drives, Automation, and Motion (SPEEDAM)","JUN 22-24, 2016JUN 22-24, 2016",,"Anacapri, ITALYAnacapri, ITALY",30,0,0,0,1,0,32,,,,,978-1-5090-2067-6,,,,,,,,,"Univ Bologna, DEI, Bologna, ItalyETH, D ITET, Zurich, Switzerland",,,,2016-01-01,WOS:000387110600038,,

This has increased the risk of wide-area blackouts. Thus, the changing generation profile in the power system necessitates the use of alternate sources of energy such as wind power plants, to provide black-start services in the future. However, this requires grid-forming and not the traditionally prevalent grid-following wind turbines. This paper introduces the general working principle of grid-forming control and examines four of such control schemes. To compare their performance, a simulation study has been carried out for the different stages of energization of onshore load by a high-voltage direct-current (HVDC)-connected wind power plant. Their transient behaviour during transformer inrush, converter pre-charging and de-blocking, and onshore block-load pickup has been compared and analysed qualitatively to highlight the advantages and disadvantages of each control strategy.",,,,,,,,,15,0,0,0,0,0,15,,,2366-7443,2366-7451,,,,,,,,,,"Tech Univ Denmark, DTU Wind Energy, DK-4000 Roskilde, DenmarkVattenfall AS, DK-6000 Kolding, Denmark",Vattenfall AS,,,2020-11-05,WOS:000580865300001,,

Corrosion occurs on the walls of these structures and can quickly lead from surface damage to aesthetics impairment. The main cause of the corrosiveness are chloride ions which facilitate initiation and propagation of pits. Stainless steels provide a wide range of applications in seawater environments. They are used for the construction of heat exchangers, tanks and capacitors for electrical systems, refrigeration systems for power plants, tidal power, wind turbines localized at sea. Mild steel find its role in almost every product created from metal due to its low cost and easy availability. The polymeric materials are having multiple adsorption sites for bonding with metal surface and provides higher inhibition efficiency than the corresponding monomers. In the present work, the corrosion inhibition of mild steel in 3.5% NaCl by PVDF/ZrO2 composites were studied. The composite samples were characterized by using XRD, FTIR and SEM. Potentiodynamic polarization and electrochemical impedance spectroscopic techniques were used to explore the enhanced corrosion inhibition of composites. The corrosion inhibition efficiency of PVDZr composites were found to increase with increase in concentration of ZrO2. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Groundwater here is affected by naturally occurring high iron (Fe2+) and As concentrations, while, in coastal regions, groundwater is additionally contaminated by high salinity mostly due to seawater intrusion. Desalination was conducted by membrane capacitive deionization (MCDI), which shows low specific energy consumption (SEC). Anoxic groundwater with As(III) and Fe2+ was treated using a pre-oxidation step called subsurface arsenic removal (SAR) with the main advantage that no As-laden waste is produced. The pilot plant was operated using a photovoltaic system (3 kW(p)) and a small wind turbine (2 kW(p)). The SEC of drinking water produced was 3.97 kWh/m(3). Total dissolved solids (TDS) of 1,560 mg/L were lowered to 188 mg/L, while Fe2+ was reduced from 1.8 mg/L to the below detection limit and As from 2.3 to 0.18 mu g/L. The results show that SAR is a feasible remediation technique for Fe2+ and As removal in remote areas, and demonstrate the potential of MCDI for brackish water desalination coupled with renewable energies.
