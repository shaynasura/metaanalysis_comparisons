In order to assess the degree of variability and to create a model of source rock quality and potential, isochore maps of the syn- and post-rift sections of the Upper Jurassic Draupne Formation and underlying Heather Formation were generated from seismic and well data, and maturity-corrected Rock-Eval data were used to generate quantitative maps of oil and gas potential. The thin post-rift section at the top of the Draupne Formation is a rich oil-prone source, while the up to 1,600 m thick syn-rift section contains a mixture of Type III and Type II material with substantial amounts of gas-prone and inert organic matter. The Heather Formation, which reaches modelled thicknesses of up to 930 m, is a lean source and is generally gas-prone.Detailed analyses and interpretations of biomarker and isotopic characteristics support this upward increase in oil-prone Type II material. The analytical parameters include increasing relative amounts of C-27 regular steranes; decreasing ratios of C-30 moretane relative to C-30 hopane; and an increasing predominance of short chain n-alkanes and progressively lighter isotopic values for saturate and aromatic fractions of source rock extracts. In addition, increasing amounts of 17 alpha(H), 21 beta(H)-28,30-bisnorhopane and decreasing amounts of C-34 homohopanes relative to C-35 homohopones, as well as decreasing Pr/Ph ratios, suggest a general decrease in oxygenation upwards. Maps of average Pr/Ph ratios for the syn- and post-rift Draupne Formation and for the Heather Formation are consistent with permanent water column stratification and gradual ascent of the O-2:H2S interface from the Callovion to the Ryazanian.Interpretation of oil and gas potential maps, molecular parameters and estimates of sediment accumulation rates in combination suggest that the source facies of the upper, post-rift Draupne Formation is controlled by widespread anoxia, reduced siliciclastic dilution and reduced input of gas-prone organic and inert material, by contrast, the potential of the lower, syn-rift Draupne Formation is strongly controlled by dilution by gas-prone and inert organic matter resulting from mass flows and also by varying degrees of oxygenation. The oil and gas potential of the Heather Formation is mainly controlled by the degree of oxygenation and siliciclastic dilution.",,,,,,,,,22,0,0,0,1,0,22,,,0141-6421,,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Bergen, Dept Earth Sci, N-5007 Bergen, NorwayExxonMobil Explorat Co, Houston, TX 77210 USAAker Kvaerner Geo AS, N-0216 Oslo, Norway",Aker Kvaerner Geo AS,,,2005-07-01,WOS:000231211200002,,

Although their potential impacts on soil organic C (SOC) storage have been reported in previous literature, the well-established mechanisms that control SOC storage response, especially in relation to soil depths, is still limited. To fill this knowledge gap, we developed a structural equation model (SEM) to identify mechanisms that account for SOC changes in topsoil (0-03 m) and subsoil (0.3-0.6 m) on coastal wetland of the East China Sea, where SOC in both depths increased with exotic Spartina alterniflora invasion. In the initial model, we hypothesized that there were a set of direct and indirect effects of the invasion, climate, and soil physicochemical properties on SOC storage. By evaluating the interactions of these factors, we found relatively complex patterns that vary with depth. For topsoil, the invasion had not only direct effects on SOC storage, but also indirect effects through mediating effects of soil water content (SWC) that was linked to fine soil fractions. For subsoil, the invasion was indirectly related to SOC storage through mediating effects of SOC in topsoil, SWC, and salinity. SOC in subsoil was also affected by temperature. Our results highlight that the response of SOC storage to the invasion and climate change results from the interacting effects of climate-plant-soil system. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

The high complexity of coastal environment entails the need for new tools that can describe the spatial variability of wind. In this paper, a distribution study of offshore wind power in China using QuikSCAT Level-2 satellite measurements at a 0.5-degree horizontal resolution was performed. Based on long-term information of daily average wind field, the paper gives an overview of the spatio-temporal distribution of wind resources in China's coastal regions. The results indicate that China has significant offshore wind energy development potential. The total offshore wind energy potential at 10 m in China is approximately 660 GW. The coastal region along Fu Jiang Province has the best wind resource compared with other parts of China's offshore regions. An integrated analysis was made by combining the offshore wind farm plans of coastal provinces with the spatio-temporal characteristics of the wind resource, and suggestions are presented accordingly. We find that the use of wind estimates from satellite data potentially leads to a more refined wind resource analysis. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Sound travels very efficiently underwater, so the potential area impacted can be thousands of square kilometres or more. The principal anthropogenic noise sources are underwater explosions (nuclear and otherwise), shipping, seismic exploration by mainly the oil and gas industries, and naval sonar operations. Strandings and mortalities of especially beaked whales (family Ziphiidae) have in many cases been conclusively linked to noise events such as naval maneuvers involving tactical sonars or seismic surveys, though other cetacean species may also be involved. The mechanisms behind this mortality are still unknown, but are most likely related to gas and fat emboli at least partially mediated by a behavioral response, such as a change in diving pattern. Estimated received sound levels in these events are typically not high enough to cause hearing damage, implying that the auditory system may not always be the best indicator for noise impacts. Beaked whales are found in small, possibly genetically isolated, local populations that are resident year-round. Thus, even transient and localized acoustic impacts can have prolonged and serious population consequences, as may have occurred following at least one stranding. Populations may also be threatened by noise through reactions such as increased stress levels, abandonment of important habitat, and masking or the obscuring of natural sounds. Documented changes in vocal behavior may lead to reductions in foraging efficiency or mating opportunities. Responses are highly variable between species, age classes, behavioral states, etc., making extrapolations problematic. Also, short-term responses may not be good proxies of long-term population-level impacts. There are many examples of apparent tolerance of noise by cetaceans, however. Noise can also affect cetaceans indirectly through their prey. Fish show permanent and temporary hearing loss, reduced catch rates, stress, and behavioral reactions to noise. Management implications of noise impacts include difficulties in establishing safe exposure levels, shortcomings of some mitigation tools, the need for precaution in the form of reducing noise levels and distancing noise from biologically important areas, and the role of marine protected areas and monitoring in safeguarding cetaceans especially from cumulative and synergistic effects.",,,,,,,,,230,5,0,0,178,0,285,,,0008-4301,1480-3283,,,,,,,,,,"Dalhousie Univ, Dept Biol, Halifax, NS B3H 4J1, Canada",,,,2007-11-01,WOS:000252772700001,,

Through the reconstruction of dynamic depositional evolution process and regional depositional framework of homoclinal ramp-rimmed platform in Upper Permian, three theories are put forward: first, early beach-late reef, multiple stacking, arrangement in rows and belts is the sedimentary mode for the reservoirs in the Changxing Formation of Yuanba area; second, dissolution in early exposure stage and dolomitization during shallow burial giving rise to the pores in matrix, overpressure caused by cracking of liquid hydrocarbon during deep burial inducing fractures is the reservoirs development mechanisms; third, coupling of pores and fractures controls the development of high quality reservoirs in deep formations. From correlation of oil and source rock, it is concluded that the Wujiaping Formation and Dalong Formation of deep-water continental shelf are the major source rocks in the Permian of northern Sichuan Basin. The hydrocarbon accumulation mode in ultra-deep formations of low-deformation zones is characterized by three-micro (micro-fault, micro-fracture interbed crack) migration, near-source enrichment, and persistent preservation. Through seismic inversion using the pore structure parameters of pore-fracture diadactic structure model, the high production gas enrichment area in Yuanba gas field is 98.5 km(2).

When implemented, monitoring programs for large-scale ecosystems typically monitor overall system health and/or the progress toward individual restoration project goals. However, being able to demonstrate successful individual restoration projects does not necessarily equate to providing cost-effective benefits at the large-scale ecosystem level, especially when the area and complexity of the system is, large. More than $16 billion is available for ecosystem restoration related activities associated with multiple Deepwater Horizon settlements (i.e., Gulf Coast Ecosystem Restoration Council, Natural Resource Damage Assessment (NRDA) Trustee Council, and National Fish and Wildlife Foundation). Restoration activities conducted under the NRDA settlement are intended to restore injured resources to conditions that would have existed in the absence of the spill and to compensate the public for lost use of injured resources. Other restoration activities funded by the settlements are designated to restore the Gulf Coast economy, culture and environmental health by addressing a multitude of other ecological and economic injuries in the Gulf ecosystem not directly caused by the spill. Although the collective funding for restoration activities is large, unprecedented, and has the potential to begin making progress toward reducing adverse long-term environmental stressors, it is insufficient to fully address all stressors to restore ecological health in the vast Gulf ecosystem. This creates a unique challenge for restoration program managers who in addition to demonstrating the success of individual projects, need to demonstrate that overall restoration funds were spent wisely and produced significant synergistic benefits to preserve and restore the Gulf ecosystem. This will be especially important as settlement funds are exhausted and resource managers seek public funding to continue restoration and conservation efforts.We evaluated approaches for integrating the monitoring of individual project outcomes in order to also monitor the combined program progress across all Gulf oil disaster restoration programs based on (1) lessons learned from other large-scale restoration programs; (2) integrated restoration goals and objectives from multiple Gulf restoration programs; (3) common stressors, and potential interactions with varying restoration and conservation target categories and their associated types of projects; and (4) the applicability of monitoring at both the project and program level. We identified a suite of 10 performance metrics or indicators that are applicable to multiple project types and restoration entities in the Gulf using restoration indicators that are highly applicable across restoration categories at both the project and system level. Utilizing a small set of indicators that can be measured across multiple resource and project types creates an opportunity to build a core set of metrics into individual project monitoring plans in a way that is cost-effective, efficient and consistent. Our approach represents one way to track the impacts of restoration activities at a scale larger than the project level in the Gulf, while recognizing the scientific, political and economic challenges associated with restoring the Gulf ecosystem in the wake of the BP Deepwater Horizon oil disaster.",,,,,,,,,10,0,0,0,7,0,11,,,1470-160X,1872-7034,,,,,,,,,,"Ocean Conservancy, 421 E 6th St,Suite B, Austin, TX 78701 USAHansonRM, 372 H St,1107, Blaine, WA 98230 USAVolkert Inc, 3809 Moffett Rd, Mobile, AL 36618 USA",Ocean ConservancyHansonRMVolkert Inc,,,2018-12-28,WOS:000430760900055,,

SimVR-Robotics is capable to recreate realistic environments and to reproduce accurately physics with multiple robots. The user can create complex scenes from a model library and simulate them in real time or, if desired, use the graphic editor to create and configure its own robot. Several components are provided to view the simulation data, control the robots and objects in the scene, and assess the feasibility of the projected scenarios. In addition, the software offers, to advanced users, access to its internal API to control the various components of the scene. As the tool is based on the ROS (Robot Operating System), it is extremely easy to integrate with other external simulators.

However, these geological conditions for CO2 storage are unavailable close to some large CO2 emitting economic areas in China.

Production and geological data of three oil fields of the Huizhou hydrocarbon cluster are analysed as analogues for large-scale aquifer storage of CO2. Results suggest the injection and storage of CO2 in individual trap structures will perform poorly, due to thin reservoir layers, small structural traps, and indications that the cap rocks may have only limited sealing capability.

For compliance it is necessary to have a comprehensive understanding of the possible spread, fate and impacts of any leaked CO2, and the ability to detect and quantify any CO2 seepage into marine or terrestrial environments. Over the past decade, a number of field scale CO2 release experiments have been conducted around the world to address many of the uncertainties regarding the characteristics of near-surface expression of CO2 in terms of the impact and quantitation of CO2 leaks. In these experiments, either free phase or dissolved CO2 was injected and released into the shallow subsurface so as to artificially simulate a CO2 leak into the near-surface environment. The experiments differ in a number of ways, from the geological conditions, surface environments, injection rates and experimental set-up - including the injection and monitoring strategy. These experiments have provided abundant information to aid in the development of our scientific understanding of environmental impacts of CO2 while assessing state of the art monitoring techniques.We collated a global dataset of field-scale shallow (depths < similar to 25 m) controlled CO2 release experiments. The dataset includes 14 different field experiment locations, of which nine intended to release CO2 to the surface, and the remaining sites intended for CO2 to remain in the shallow subsurface. Several release experiments have been conducted at half of these sites, and so in total, 41 different CO2 release tests have taken place at the 14 sites in our dataset. We scrutinized our dataset to establish: (i) the range of experimental approaches and settings explored to date (such as the environment, subsurface conditions, injection strategy and whether gaseous or dissolved CO2 were injected and in what quantities); (ii) the range of CO2 injection and surface release rates at these experiments; (iii) the collective learnings about the surface and subsurface manifestation of the CO2 release, the spread and fate of the CO2, rates of CO2 flux to surface, and methods of measuring these; (iv) the strengths and limitations of current approaches for detecting and quantifying CO2. This allowed us to highlight where uncertainties remain and identify knowledge gaps that future experiments should seek to address. Further, drawing on the collective experiences, we have identified common issues or complications which future CO2 release experiments can learn from.",,,,,,,,,17,0,0,0,5,0,17,,,0012-8252,1872-6828,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Strathclyde, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Glasgow G1 1XJ, Lanark, ScotlandCSIRO, Natl Geosequestrat Lab, 26 Dick Perry Ave, Kensington, WA 6151, Australia",,,,2020-10-20,WOS:000575842100006,,

However, as stricter regulations and environmental concerns are increasing over time, the importance of measuring OiW in real-time intensifies. The significant amount of uncertainties associated with manual samplings, that is currently not taken into consideration, could potentially affect the acceptance of OiW monitors and lower the reputation of all online OiW measurement techniques. This work presents the performance of four fluorescence-based monitors on an in-house testing facility. Previous studies of a fluorescence-based monitor have raised concerns about the measurement of OiW concentration being flow-dependent. The proposed results show that the measurements from the fluorescence-based monitors are not or insignificantly flow-dependent. However, other parameters, such as gas bubbles and droplet sizes, do affect the measurement. Testing the monitors' calibration method revealed that the weighted least square is preferred to achieve high reproducibility. Due to the high sensitivity to different compositions of atomic structures, other than aromatic hydrocarbons, the fluorescence-based monitor might not be feasible for measuring OiW concentrations in dynamic separation facilities with consistent changes. Nevertheless, they are still of interest for measuring the separation efficiency of a deoiling hydrocyclone to enhance its deoiling performance, as the separation efficiency is not dependent on OiW trueness but rather the OiW concentration before and after the hydrocyclone.",,,,,,,,,8,0,0,0,0,0,8,,,,1424-8220,,,,,,,,,,"Aalborg Univ, Dept Energy Technol, Niels Bohrs Vej 8, DK-6700 Esbjerg, Denmark",,,,2020-09-25,WOS:000568593400001,32784448,

To gain some insight into the potential for maintaining ecosystem health in this region we undertook a study that assessed the distribution of weeds across very extensive transects. This weed survey was distinct from other studies in that many of the sample sites were distant from tracks or other infrastructure. Twenty-one weed species were recorded along 2000 km of transects. Weeds were reported from 18.7% of the 718 sample points. The incidence of weeds was found to be significantly associated with land tenure, being highest on pastoral lands and peri-urban areas, and very low on Aboriginal lands. The incidence of weeds increased significantly with increasing levels of infrastructure and with increasing proximity to watercourses. There are three main conclusions from this study. First, much of the Top End, particularly remote Aboriginal lands, has exceptionally low levels of weed infestation. Secondly, in such areas, given the relatively small extent of vegetation change through weed invasion, maintenance or re-imposition of traditional fire regimes should be achievable. Thirdly, there is substantial potential for spread of weeds to remote areas, with such spread most likely to occur through increased penetration by infrastructure. Importantly this study indicates that there is still opportunity to prevent widespread weed invasion across the Top End, which is timely given the current Government consideration of the potential for the region to support future agricultural expansion and the fast-paced development of mining, oil and gas resources.",,,,,,,,,12,0,0,0,9,0,14,,,1442-7001,1442-8903,,,,,,,,,,"Charles Darwin Univ, Sch Environm Res, POB 496, Palmerston, NT 0831, Australia",,,,2010-08-01,BCI:BCI201000463466,,

However, the nature, location and maturity of ORE have led to several legal and policy challenges which condition the success of these industries.Even though the ability to generate electricity from marine renewables is not in question, since technology is moving ahead of policy, its integration in wider energy networks might be problematic given the localised nature of the resources, and the high variability/low predictability of their output over multiple timescales.Limited practical experience with the deployment of these technologies coupled with the difficulty of studying the marine environment represent barriers to acquiring knowledge on their impacts, particularly wave and tidal energy. These data gaps are amplified by underdeveloped regulatory frameworks regarding marine planning and sitting processes, including Environmental Impact Assessment, not adapted to manage uncertainty, and often making it too difficult for potential developers to get consent and thus invest.As part of EU's Blue Growth Strategy, ORE's demand for exclusive rights over resources and a marine space creates potential conflicts by entering already congested oceans, traditionally regulated in a single-sector manner for different marine activities.Previously proposed solutions to these constraints have failed to acknowledge the combined importance of all types of environmental policy instruments: evolving legal frameworks, targets and commitments; practical differences in domestic implementation of regulation, market-based and suasive instruments; and fragmentation of institutional architectures associated with constantly evolving actor networks operating for ORE governance. Studying policy instrument mixes might demonstrate the changing roles of state and societal actors, and ultimately contribute for the debate surrounding the sustainability and governance transition to renewable energy.",,,,,16th International Scientific Conference on Economic and Social Development - The Legal Challenges of Modern World16th International Scientific Conference on Economic and Social Development - The Legal Challenges of Modern World,"SEP 01-02, 2016SEP 01-02, 2016","Varazdin Dev & Entrepreneurship Agcy; Univ Split, Fac Law; Univ NVarazdin Dev & Entrepreneurship Agcy; Univ Split, Fac Law; Univ N","Split, CROATIASplit, CROATIA",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,1849-6903,1849-7535,*****************,,,,,,,,,"Univ Hull, Sch Law & Polit, Kingston Upon Hull, N Humberside, England",,,,2017-02-01,WOS:000391254400054,,

Thus, this paper proposes an assessment framework that consolidates environmental sustainability indicators reported by oil and gas companies into an integrative index. This index allows performing a benchmarking of the oil and gas industry. The proposed framework is based on a multi-criteria approach which uses an S-curve scale transformation for standardizing the indicators and multi-attribute utility theory for consolidating the indicators. We investigated international sustainability guidelines to define the main environmental indicators to be compared and then analyzed environmental performance data collected from eleven top global oil and gas companies. As a result, we identify nine main indicators and rank the eleven companies according to their overall scores. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

We investigated how tidal wetland SOC density was distributed across the continental United States among various coastal locations, estuarine typologies, vegetation types, water regimes, and management regimes and found that knowledge of a wetland's coastal affiliation provided the most differentiation (whether on the East Coast, West Coast, or Gulf Coast). We then sought to identify whether SOC density was correlated with 47 different environmental variables and found that knowledge based on latitude and precipitation explained similar to 46% of the variance in SOC density for wetlands on the West Coast and Gulf Coast, respectively. Several other geographic, oceanic, terrestrial, and atmospheric factors were cross-correlated along these axes, including oceanic salinity, temperature, and average catchment elevation. For the U.S. East Coast, SOC density was not simple to explain and was likely dependent on a wide range of interacting and complex factors.

It is a companion report to the earlier one by Haggarty et al. (2003) on marine environmental quality in British Columbia's Central Coast (CC). Together, these two reports form the basis for a third summary report which encompasses the revised and presently described Pacific North Coast Integrated Management Area (PNCIMA; Johannessen et al. 2007). This NC report reviews contaminant sources, types, and risks for the northern mainland coast of BC and the Queen Charlotte Islands. This region encompasses the northern portion of the steep and rugged coastal fjordlands including the Skeena and Nass watersheds, as well as the less mountainous but similarly rugged coastline of the Queen Charlotte Islands. The marine area covers the continental shelf and slope waters of Dixon Entrance, most of Hecate Strait, and the waters off the west coast of the Queen Charlotte Islands, roughly a third of BC's coastal waters. This area is among the least populated in BC, with only [approximately] 80,000 residents (about 2% of BC's total). However, the area supports significant human activities such as mining and smelting operations, fishing activities,. and abundant marine traffic. In addition, it is subject to various global transport mechanisms that bring persistent pollutants into the area. Existing literature suggests that current risks to marine environmental quality include shipping traffic, which produces chronic oil releases among other wastes; metal contamination from existing and previous mining activities, particularly in the Alice Arm area; hydrocarbon contamination, particularly in the area around the Kitimat smelter; pulp mill effluents in Kitimat and Prince Rupert; potential contamination due to port related activities in Prince Rupert and Kitimat; and possible contamination issues related to past practices at military and coast guard sites. Emerging issues for the area include potential oil and gas exploration, a rapidly expanding cruise ship industry, and possible growth in the aquaculture industry.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,0706-6457,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2007-01-01,ZOOREC:ZOOR14403014466,,

Foraminifera, marsh microfossils known to be sensitive to a range of environmental stress factors, were used to monitor the effects of the residual oil and the experimental treatments. Results show that the foraminifera responded quickly to the oil and that the oil had a statistically significant, negative impact, as demonstrated by a dramatic increase in deformities in the tests of Miliammina fusca, compared to specimens from the non-oiled control plots. The results clearly show that foraminifera can be excellent indicators of oil pollution using only the percent of deformed tests.

At the Statfjord field, injection wells from one nitrate-treated reservoir and one biocide-treated reservoir were reversed (backflowed) and sampled for microbial analysis. The two reservoirs have similar properties and share the same pre-nitrate treatment history.

The NRB community was able to utilize the same substrates as the SRB community. Compared to the biocide-treated reservoir, the microbial community in the nitrate-treated reservoir was more phylogenetically diverse and able to grow on a wider range of substrates.

National legislative bodies, together with the 2001 UNESCO Convention on the Protection of the Underwater Cultural Heritage, underline the need to develop a legal and methodological framework for management of the submerged cultural heritage. Besides ship wrecks, which are numerous, Stone Age settlements likely represent the dominant type of submerged cultural heritage sites requiring competent and cost-effective management. As the average sea level during successive glaciations was, for long periods, more than 100 m below that of today, and as the subsequently submerged areas appear to have been more intensely inhabited than hitherto imagined, it seems logical to expect well-preserved remains of early human settlement to be associated with these highly productive prehistoric coastal areas. The archaeological finds recorded demonstrate that this settlement, even in Northern Europe, extends back as far as 1 million years.A pre-requisite for a successful implementation of future legislative initiatives is the development of a technical basis consisting of 1) cost-effective methodologies for mapping and investigating the submerged Stone Age sites and 2) cost-effective methods for investigating/excavating the deeper submerged Stone Age sites.This study addresses the latter point because it is seen as being important to facilitate an interactive development of legislation and the possibilities that technological advances in underwater acoustic sensing, positioning, robotics and mechatronics can provide. For example, it would presently be quite problematic to have to carry out an investigation of a well-preserved mammoth-hunter site covered by 5 m of sediments and located at a depth of 70 m. How should one excavate such a site at a reasonable quality level? It is likely that we may have to deal with situations of this type in the near future.This paper discusses how the maximum amount of information can be obtained about such sites during a pre-excavation evaluation stage by physical characterization of cultural and surrounding layers and sediment/dirt DNA analysis, etc, as well as the possibilities for on-site excavation or, alternatively, the extraction of blocks of sediment for excavation under controlled conditions during an actual investigation.",,,,,MTS/IEEE OCEANS ConferenceMTS/IEEE OCEANS Conference,"JUN 10-14, 2013JUN 10-14, 2013","Marine Technol Soc; IEEE; IEEE Ocean Engn Soc; SFE Power; Marintek; Norwegian Def Res Estab; Inst Marine Res; Univ Bergen, Geophys Inst; Gersemia, Bekkadal Consultancy & Engn Serv; NERSCMarine Technol Soc; IEEE; IEEE Ocean Engn Soc; SFE Power; Marintek; Norwegian Def Res Estab; Inst Marine Res; Univ Bergen, Geophys Inst; Gersemia, Bekkadal Consultancy & Engn Serv; NERSC","Bergen, NORWAYBergen, NORWAY",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,0197-7385,,978-1-4799-0000-8; 978-1-4799-0002-2,,,,,,,,,"Strandingsmuseet St George, Ctr Maritime Arcaeol, Vesterhavsvej 1E, DK-6990 Ulfborg, Denmark",Strandingsmuseet St George,,,2014-06-11,WOS:000335313100085,,

Scientists state unequivocally that the earth is warming. Natural climate variability alone cannot explain this trend. Human activities, especially the burning of coal and oil, have warmed the earth by dramatically increasing the concentrations of heat-trapping gases in the atmosphere. The more of these gases humans put into the atmosphere, the more the earth will warm in the decades and centuries ahead. The impacts of warming can already be observed in many places, from rising sea levels to melting snow and ice to changing weather patterns. Climate change is already affecting ecosystems, freshwater supplies, and human health. Although climate change cannot be avoided entirely, the most severe impacts of climate change can be avoided by substantially reducing the amount of heat-trapping gases released into the atmosphere. However, the time available for beginning serious action to avoid severe global consequences is growing short. This paper reviews assessing of such climate change impacts on various components of the ecosystem such as air, water, plants, animals and human beings, with special emphasis on economy. The most daunting problem of global warming is also discussed. This paper, further reviews the mitigation measures, with a special focus on carbon sequestration and clean development mechanism (CDM). The importance of synergy between climate change mitigation and adaptation has been discussed.

This study presents Re-Os geochronology, Rock-Eval pyrolysis and geochemical data for Upper Jurassic rocks in the Nordland VII area, offshore northern Norway. Four intervals of organic-rich shale were investigated, two from the Krill and one from the Alge Member of the Hekkingen Formation and one from the underlying Masnykan Formation (drilled cores 6814/04/U-01 and 6814/04/U-02). Rock-Eval pyrolysis data indicate immature organic matter with mixed (Type II/III) oil-gas potential in these units. Among the four intervals, Re-Os isochroneity prevails only for the Hekkingen Formation samples; data from the shale interval in the otherwise sand-rich Masnykan Formation, deposited in a shoreface-to-foreshore marine environment, are not isochronous. Non-isochroneity of the samples from relatively proximal setting is attributable to non-conservative elemental (desorption of Os from sediments to dissolved phase) and isotopic exchange of Os at this depositional site. The Re-Os isochron age for the Alge Member (153.2 +/- 7.3 Ma (Model 3); MSWD = 29; n = 9) is consistent with its biostratigraphic Kimmeridgian age (152.1-157.3 Ma). A Re-Os isochron for the lower part of the Krill Member yields an age of 144.5 +/- 1.4 Ma (Model 3; MSWD = 3.7; n = 10) with an initial Os-187/Os-188 ratio of 0.552 +/- 0.007. Given the interval's lower Tithonian biostratigraphic age, the Re-Os age suggests that the J/K boundary must be a few Myr younger than its currently assigned age of similar to 145.0 Ma (2017/02 time scale; www.stratigraphy.org ). A Re-Os model age for shales from the upper part of the Krill Member places an upper age limit for the J/K boundary at 142 ( +/- 2) Ma. Hence, the J/K boundary is between 142 Ma and 144.5 Ma.Fe and S concentrations for the Hekkingen Formation show strong correlation and the S/Fe slope (similar to 1.19) mimics the stoichiometric S/Fe ratio for pyrite (similar to 1.15). A Fe-S-TOC ternary diagram for these samples points to an iron-limiting, sulphidic depositional environment. Anoxic to sulphidic depositional conditions for the Hekkingen shales are also evident from relatively higher authigenic enrichment of Mo compared to U. Unlike the Hekkingen Formation, shales from the more sandy Masnykan Formation have lower S/Fe ratios and lower enrichment factors for redox-sensitive elements, indicating relatively oxygenated marine conditions during deposition.",,,,,,,,,13,4,0,0,3,0,17,,,0031-0182,1872-616X,,,,,,,,,,"Colorado State Univ, Dept Geosci, AIRIE Program, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USAIndian Inst Sci Educ & Res, Dept Earth & Climate Sci, Pune 411008, Maharashtra, IndiaUniv Oslo, CEED Ctr Excellence, POB 1048, N-0316 Oslo, Norway",,,,2018-07-03,WOS:000435624600002,,

They carry oil and gas from offshore fields and are used in offloading tankers and transporting liquid obtained offshore. They transport to sea, for disposal, sewage and in some cases sludge from metropolitan areas, wastewaters from industrial complexes, and heated cooling water from power plants or water to be used in Ocean Thermal Energy Conversion (OTEC) plants or acquaria. This proposal is for experimental research to study the forces imposed by waste-induced water motion on a test pipe set at various locations within an open trench of different shapes and dimensions. In practice, problems can arise in this context when large waves arrive before a pipe trench can be naturally or artificially backfilled. In the research, a 12.75-inch-dimeter test pipe will be configured for this experiment. This system will be installed offshore from Honolulu within a prepared 5.0- ft-deep seabed trench of adjustable cross-section. The approximate water depth at the site will be 37 ft. Wave-induced water motion will be perpendicular to the pipe and will be generated by 12- to 16-second swells arriving during the period April-August. Judging from past observations, wave heights to 12 ft. are virtually certain. Horizontal and vertical force data on the pipe's central test section, as well as water motion information from a nearby current sensor, will be recorded on the project boat anchored over the site. All data will be processed and anlayzed to yield Morison equation wave force coefficients as well as maximum force coefficients. Plots displaying variations in these coefficients with trench/pipe details and wave characteristics will add to the research information base and should be of considerable benefit to submarine pipe designers.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,8813675,,,,,,,,University of Hawaii,,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:13920535,,

Managed pressure drilling (MPD) techniques are increasingly used as alternatives to conventional drilling operations to manage such extreme conditions and reduce drilling costs and risks. Many safety and operational issues related to MPD process need to be investigated more thoroughly. Well kick is considered a typical hazardous event that may occur at different drilling phases, and such an event is prone to develop into a blowout. During offshore drilling phases, the risk of accidents may change with time, and such a dynamic characteristic should be recorded in risk assessment. This study presents a method for the application of dynamic Bayesian networks (DBNs) in conducting accident scenario analysis and dynamic quantitative risk assessment for MPD safety. This method can model the influence of uncertain risk factors, which have been ignored in existing research, by introducing an additional probability parameter. The effects of degradation are also taken into account. DBN inference is adopted to perform quantitative risk analysis and dynamic risk evolution. Then, the vulnerable root causes are identified by sensitivity analysis for accident prevention and mitigation measures. Well kick for four drilling cases is analyzed as a case study to demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed method.

Based on land use data, research results related to carbon densities in vegetation and soil as well as government policies related to development in different regions of China, this paper optimized land use structure in 2020 for different regions with the goal of increasing terrestrial ecosystem carbon storage. We defined seven types of land use: (1) cultivated land, (2) garden land, (3) woodland, (4) pasture land, (5) other agricultural land, (6) urbanized land, and (7) a mixture of other land which we call mixed land which included open water, swamps, glaciers and other land as defined below. We found: (1) For most eastern regions, woodland has the highest carbon (C) densities while C densities of pasture land and cultivated land did not differ widely. Both have C densities higher than urbanized land while urbanized land has higher carbon densities than the areas placed in the mixed land type. (2) Under an optimized land use structure projected for 2020, the area of cultivated land will decrease compared with 2005 for most regions. The areas of garden land, pasture land and other agricultural land are much smaller compared with the mixed land use type, and the changes there are not obvious and their contributions to increased carbon storage are not significant. The area of woodland will increase the most obviously and it will contribute the most to increased carbon storage. The increasing urbanization of land and the decreasing trend of other land types make it difficult to change carbon storage patterns since the Chinese economy is expanding rapidly. (3) The optimized land use structure presented here will have effects on the entire country though with regional differences. Some inland regions will always have a larger potential to increase carbon storage than other areas because the potentialities in some coastal regions are limited by social and economic development.

J,,,,,,,,,,,Sounds in the sea: how can we listen from ocean gliders?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Awarded Grant,Sep 30 2016,2016,"Measurement of sound in the sea has a long history but the advent of autonomous vehicles offers a new opportunity for full-depth, high-resolution, year-round monitoring. As the oceans become ever noisier, we need to understand and develop new smart, efficient systems to detect rainfall, wind, shipping or industrial noise, and marine mammal calls. In this project Pierre will explore the scientific potential of ocean gliders for marine acoustic mapping, and assess what we can learn about the marine environment from such measurements.UEA and the glider manufacturer Kongsberg trialled passive acoustic monitoring (PAM) sensors on our gliders during a 2014 campaign in the Mediterranean. This pilot data set is available for analysis for this project. In parallel, SAMS have developed Drifting Ears, freely drifting smart sensors to measure underwater sound with a focus on marine mammal detection. Cefas are developing PAM technology for their Wavegliders and have extensive experience of analysing PAM sensor data from moorings. This PhD combines this expertise to provide an exciting project at the cutting edge of developing this new capability. Depending on Pierre's interests, the project may have an emphasis on applications for marine mammal detection, marine anthropogenic noise, rainfall or a combination of these.We will equip one of the UEA Seagliders with a newly developed PAM sensor and Pierre will explore its use both in the laboratory and in Pierre's own dedicated deployment, which may be in UK shelf seas, or in the Indian Ocean as part of the 2nd International Indian Ocean Experiment. Pierre will 1) use UEAs state-of-the-art seawater tank to trial the PAM sensor and develop new smart signal processing techniques to assess and remove the sounds of the glider manoeuvres, such as pumps and motors and 2) undertake a glider PAM sensor deployment and analyse the signals of marine mammals, ships and other sources of noise to determine the resulting soundscape.A novel data processing method to account for the glider's profiling path may be necessary. Experimentation and development of a 'loitering' capability will be undertaken with the glider manufacturers.Pierre will work closely with SAMS and Cefas acoustics experts, who are experienced in processing acoustic data and extracting relevant signals for particular applications. For example, marine biologists at SAMS use sound to identify the presence of particular species of marine mammals, and Cefas monitor the impacts of sound associated with pile driving and windfarms in the North Sea. The NEXUSS CDT provides state-of-the-art, highly experiential training in the application and development of cutting-edge Smart and Autonomous Observing Systems for the environmental sciences, alongside comprehensive personal and professional development. There will be extensive opportunities for students to expand their multi-disciplinary outlook through interactions with a wide network of academic, research and industrial / government / policy partners. Pierre will be registered and hosted in COAS and will also spend significant periods of time working at SAMS and Cefas. UEA is renowned globally for its expertise in marine and atmospheric science, and is the only UK university to own and operate its own fleet of ocean gliders. SAMS also runs a glider survey operationally in the North Atlantic, and has a long history of innovative technological development. Cefas is the agency tasked with monitoring the UK's waters. Embedding this project within all these groups will give Pierre exceptional access to learning from top scientists. Specific training will include: - ocean glider piloting, operation, and data analysis- oceanography and marine biology- acoustics- computing and signal processing of large acoustic data sets- seagoing and marine data collection skills- engineering challenges for sensor integration and development.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,1802641,,,,,,,,University of East Anglia,,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:15380866,,

First phase dive report on the VOC-Wreck Site of the Amstelveen, 1763.",,,,,,,,Data Archiving and Networked Services (DANS-KNAW),,,,,,,,,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.17026/dans-x9k-wjus,,,,,,,Data study,2020-05-06,2017,"In 1763 a large ship, the Amstelveen, part of the fleet of the Dutch East-India Company (VOC), sailed from the Dutch East-Indies (Indonesia) towards Muscat, the capital of Oman and to Kharg in the Persian Gulf. On the 5th of August it sailed near Cape Mataraca, on the South East coast of Oman. In the evening, as the darkness was setting in and hampered by the foggy conditions, the ship came too close to the coast and ran aground. Due to the very high and powerful waves crashing on and breaking over the ship she capsized and broke into pieces and sank. On board were 105 men of which 75 of them drowned. Only 30 crewmen reached the shore alive. One of them was Cornelis Eyks, a naval officer. He and his companions had to walk more than 500 km through the desert of Oman, to reach Ras Al Hadd, a village with a harbor where they were able to find transport to Muscat. The shipwreck and their exhausting trek through the desert by the survivors, was recorded in a logbook by Cornelis Eyks and described in his diary. Maritime Research & Consultancy, Periplus Archeomare and the survey company DEEP BV, in cooperation with the Ministry of Heritage and Culture of Oman and Stichting Netherlands Oman Foundation, provided a high-resolution Side scan Sonar and Magnetometer survey in November 2012 in the area where the Amstelveen is presumed to have been wrecked in 1763: Cape Mataraca. This joint Omani-Dutch maritime archaeological research forms part of a wider project which will be initiated by the Ministry of Heritage and Culture, whose aim is to explore and map the greater part of the Omani coastline for ancient shipwrecks. This survey project was managed by David Bouman MA, Chief Maritime Archaeologist and project director, in close collaboration with Ayyoub Naghmoush Albusaidi, Maritime Archaeologist and official representative of the Oman Ministry of Heritage and Culture. From November 5 till November 14, after extensive literature and archival research and logistical planning, Maritime Research & Consultancy in close cooperation with the Oman Ministry of Hertitage and Culture, conducted an archaeological remote sensing survey near Ras Madrakah to identify the location of the wreck site of the VOC-ship Amstelveen. For the execution of this geophysical survey, Maritime Research & Consultancy contracted the Dutch companies Periplus Archeomare and DEEP BV. Ras Madrakah (Cape Mataraca), on the South East coast of Oman, is a headland located 78 km south of Duqm and represents the point where the mainland juts furthest into the Arabian Sea. The extent of the survey area had been determined at 25km: a stroke of 25 kilometers long and kilometer width, parallel to the beach. The initial definition of the survey area was based on the description of the wreckage of the Amstelveen and coordinates given by Cornelis Eyks in his logbook of 1766. This information and a possible location of the wreck area are also mentioned in the publication of Klaas Doornbos book `Shipwreck & Survival in Oman, 1763. In order to fine-tune and access the above mentioned sources, Maritime Research & Consultancy consulted two independent researchers who independently made reconstructions of the shipwreck event. In total an area of 31,5 square kilometers parallel to the beach was mapped with high resolution side scan sonar and magnetometer. Different types of seabed can clearly be distinguished from the side scan sonar records. Approximately 0,4 percent of the research area investigated by sonar could not be seen because of the presence of large shoals of fish, especially in the western part of the area. Based on the analysis of the data, four areas of interest have been defined which contain clear magnetic anomalies, indicating the presence of ferrous objects. All these areas are situated within a water depth range of 4 to 8 meters. Obvious manmade contacts have not been observed on the side scan sonar records. A dive inspection in one of the areas of interest did not result in the finding of objects. The ability to work on site was primarily influenced by one factor: visibility. Visibility encountered on the site varied between 0.5m and 1m. The maximum depth of the site was 8 meters at high tide, so depth did not influence working conditions. In fact, the shallow nature of the site allows for extended bottom times and long working dive times with limited tank usage required. Additionally, ascent rates were appropriately observed, but no safety stop or dive‐time limitations were required. Two of the four areas of interest are most promising in relation to possible wreck remains. The first area, situated in the centre of the research area contains a dense cluster of magnetic anomalies spread over an area of 500x200 meter. The second area is situated near Khor Gharm in the eastern part. Although visual assessment was not possible, on the basis of archival research and the data collected during the remote sensing survey, the conclusion and recommendation of Maritime Research & Consultancy and Periplus Archeomare is, that an archaeological research of each target in the two most promising areas (marked as A and C) need to be strongly considered in further planning by the Oman Ministry of Heritage and Culture. In close cooperation with the Oman Ministry of Heritage & Culture it was decided that a dive expedition should be organized in March this year in order to try to locate and identify the ferrous objects registered during Novembers geophysical survey. For this purpose a joint Omani-Dutch divingteam was formed. For a - initially - ten days period this diving operation would mainly focus on area A. The Royal Oman Navy would be present during this expedition for protection, logistical support as well as providing sleeping and eating facilities for the team on board. The RNOV Al Mabrukah was deployed for this task. The diving operation started on March 14 and ended on March 20. Effectively the team had 7 working days, of which three were lost: two days due to technical problems and one due to bad weather condtions. So, in conclusion four workinge days were effectuated. Those four days proved to be too short a period for finding the Amstelveen shipwreck.

This paper reviews the literature regarding the characterization and environmental effects of burn residues in Arctic waters. The results of a systematic literature search indicate that only a very limited number of studies have arctic pertinence. From the review, it is also indicated that the properties and composition of the residues depend on the efficiency of the burning and the oil type. Furthermore, the studies within the frame of the literature search reach consensus that in situ burning may increase the concentrations of large poly-aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs; high ring number) while reducing small PAHs (low ring number). There are very few toxicity studies of burn residues on aquatic and arctic organisms, and to enhance the knowledge base, more organisms as well as oil types must be studied. Furthermore, there is a lack of studies investigating the potential effect of sinking burn residues on benthic organism and the smothering effects of the more viscous burn residues on birds and other organisms related to the sea surface. More knowledge regarding environmental fate and effect of residues is crucial to complete a robust net environmental benefit analysis prior to an oil spill response operation in arctic waters.",,,,,,,,,68,3,0,0,35,0,78,,,0049-6979,1573-2932,,,,,,,,,,"Aarhus Univ, Dept Biosci, DK-4000 Roskilde, Denmark",,,,2015-10-01,WOS:000361764400008,,

Due to the small CP diameter, the CP plugs very often. Normally the material is drilled out by using jetting, normal drill rigs and sometimes jack-up rigs. As offshore operations time is very important, this paper tries to assess the theoretical net time needed to excavate within the CP as a relief drilling operation, by means of Nishimatsu and Evans cutting theories. The results are compared with publicly available TBM excavation rates and then theoretical drilling rates for different unconfined compressive strength values for CP diameters of 700, 900 and 1000 mm are suggested. The results are considered for drag bits, however, they are only theoretical assumptions and cannot be applied for commercial projects with the same geotechnical properties.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,0960-3182,1573-1529,,,,,,,,,,"BAUER Maschinen GmbH, Dept Maritime Technol, Bauer Str 1, D-86529 Schrobenhausen, GermanyPolitecn Torino, Dept Environm Land & Infrastruct Engn, Corso Duca Abruzzi 24, I-10129 Turin, ItalyFranks Int, Great Yarmouth NR30 1HZ, EnglandFranks Int, Purkayeva 120B, Yuzhno Sakhalinsk 693006, Russia",BAUER Maschinen GmbHFranks IntFranks Int,,,2017-05-24,WOS:000400101600025,,

In particular, vertical equilibrium models provide the simplest possible description of the flow dynamics during the injection and early post-injection period, while percolation type methods provide effective means for forecasting the long-term fate of CO2 during the later migration stages. We investigate the storage volumes that can be achieved for several formations found along the Norwegian Continental Shelf by optimizing well placement and injection rates, and using production wells for pressure management when necessary.

Energised by a burgeoning environmentalism acquired in New York City and terrified by the alreadyapparent impacts of mass tourism on this once-barren volcanic island, Manrique quite literally saw an opportunity in the landscape. Manrique and the local tourism bureau undertook a decades long project to rebrand and, more importantly, redesign the island as simultaneously artistic and ecologically unique. Thirty years later, UNESCO designated Lanzarote a World Heritage Site in part for this socio-ecological synthesis, in some ways precluding overdevelopment and in other ways encouraging Lanzarote's branding as a uniquely desirable tourist destination. Today, Lanzarote has made substantial public investment in the Museo Atlantico, a massive underwater museum and artificial reef, to extend Manrique's original legacy and sink tourism development to the seafloor. Lanzarote was one of the first `art islands,' discreet geologic sites made unique in a competitive globalising island tourism industry by embedding art into the local ecology itself.

J,"Long, C.",,,,,,,,,,Analysis of the possible displacement of bird and marine mammal species related to the installation and operation of marine energy conversion systems.,,,,,,,,Scottish Natural Heritage Commissioned Report,,,,947,,,,i,"xii, 1-319",,,,,,,,,,,Article,2017,2017,"Background Under the European Environmental Impact Assessment and Habitats Directives, there is a regulatory need to determine whether the deployment and operation of marine energy conversion systems (MECS) is likely to have any significant effect on the environment or affect the integrity of European Protected Sites (e.g. designated Natura 2000 sites). An important part of this is to identify whether MECS have any impact on the abundance or distribution of wildlife species in the vicinity of such devices. Using information collected at its grid -connected tidal and wave test sites, the European Marine Energy Centre (EMEC) in Orkney has led in-depth analyses of land -based wildlife observation data with respect to the operational status of different devices. With the aim of addressing this key concern for the industry, this project looks at the possible displacement of marine birds and marine mammals from the sea areas that they habitually use around EMEC's two grid-connected test sites (Fall of Warness and Billia Croo). This data analysis project has brought in expertise from the Centre for Research into Ecological and Environmental Modelling (CREEM) in the application of the statistical package MRSea to quantify any spatially-explicit change attributable to MECS testing. This report describes the survey techniques used to gather the test site observations, explains the statistical methodology subsequently applied to analyse the resulting dataset, and sets out the results of the analyses with respect to the potential displacement of key wildlife species that can be associated with the various testing phases for marine energy converters. Data limitations and assumptions which underpin the analysis are highlighted and reference is made to the potential use of the dataset for future analyses. Further recommendations are made regarding the continuation of land -based observation programmes run at EMEC and, if continued, how the data collection methodologies could be amended to improve dataset quality. Main findings The purpose of the EMEC Wildlife Data Analysis Project was to assess the extent of any displacement of key wildlife species arising from the installation and operation of marine energy converter systems (MECS). Nearly 18,000 hours of land based observations data, collected since 2005, were utilised for the project, drawn from EMEC's Wildlife Observations Programme. These data were collected, primarily, to aid in site characterisation of EMEC's two MECS test sites, at Fall of Warness (tidal energy) and Billia Croo (wave energy), rather than to inform an impact assessment study. Accordingly, though the datasets are extensive, the survey design was not optimal in terms of discerning change related to development activity, for example lacking a control site. This was addressed, in part, by comparing species data collected under four differing levels of site activity / impact. Comprehensive analyses were conducted on data for ten species/groups of species selected from each of the two test sites. Alongside the data collected during the Wildlife Observations Programme, this data analysis project utilises device operational data collected from developers testing at EMEC. These data are commercially sensitive and, therefore, are not available for public dissemination. An anonymization process was implemented to ensure commercial confidentiality was maintained throughout the project, which meant that it was necessary to apply site-wide impact levels. The result of this constraint is that inferences regarding the effect of device presence/operation at a device-or developer specific level cannot be drawn from the analyses. Using the statistical modelling R package 'MRSea', developed by the Centre for Research into Ecological and Environmental Modelling (CREEM) at the University of St Andrews, it was possible to produce models that have the ability to estimate the distribution and abundance of species. These models also allow the effect of device presence and operation to be investigated by considering if there is any evidence of spatially-explicit changes in species density. Statistical significance was attributed to some of the predicted density changes. However, for some species, the natural variation evident under baseline conditions made it difficult to distinguish changes associated with the changing site operational level within the wider range of natural variation. An attempt was made to model natural variation for each species by including temporal and environmental terms within the model; however, no attempt was made to include wider variables that may in some instances affect the population e.g. harbour seal decline in Orkney. Fitted models for each of the species tend to include terms to account for seasonality and interannual variation in abundance. Environmental influences on species density were also taken into consideration, including environmental terms such as precipitation, cloud cover and wind strength. Power analyses were conducted on some of the final fitted models in order to understand their capability to detect certain scenarios of species changes, particularly whether the model result reflects the true situation or indicates that the model is unable to detect such a change. Effects directly associated with the presence, operation, or related infrastructure of MECS, are inferred only where there are spatially-explicit differences in density that can be associated with grid cells containing test berths. Many of the outputs produced from the fitted models, particularly at the Fall of Warness test site, suggest that the greatest change in density occurs when device-associated infrastructure (including anchoring systems, foundations and mooring systems) is installed onsite. This change in density is not limited to test berths but tends to stretch beyond, to the rest of the survey grid. For most species in the Fall of Warness survey area, the extent of this change is reduced with the installation of devices and when they are operating. This would suggest that it may not be the physical presence of the device or its infrastructure that is causing this change in density, but rather the increased vessel movements that are associated with installation activities. Vessel movements are expected to reduce when devices become operational. Although vessel movement data were collected throughout the observations programme run at both sites, these data tended to be anecdotal, rather than systematic, and not of sufficient quality to be included in the analyses. Further research regarding this particular potential impact pathway, possibly using the Automatic Identification System (AIS) data collected at both sites, may prove valuable. While it is tempting to interpret the reduction in the scale of change with increasing site impact level as evidence of habituation, the overall operational status of the site has continually altered, rather than progressing steadily to a more developed state, making such an inference debatable. Almost all the species surveyed at the Billia Croo test site show similar densities for all site impact levels and there appears to be no correlation between changes in densities and the location of test berths. Due to the size of the Billia Croo site, the density estimates produced from the fitted models tend to have a greater uncertainty surrounding them, compared to the Fall of Warness models. Power analyses were conducted on the fitted models in order to determine whether a modelling result that shows no change in species density actually reflects a true situation or is the result of the model being unable to detect such a change. Varying results have been gained from the power analyses conducted on the Fall of Warness models, with models able to detect a 50% decline in density for certain species (even when survey effort is halved) and others unable to do so. Where models have shown to have good power in detecting change, there has tended to be variation across the site. It is possible that this is associated with areas of high density estimates for some species or areas of low uncertainty. It has not proved possible to conduct power analyses on the fitted Billia Croo models due to low species densities there, resulting in the vast majority of data points being zeros, once survey effort is included. This led to the fitted data used in the power analysis simulation having means that were too small to allow generation from an overdispersed Poisson distribution. Although, within the project's limitations, it was only feasible to investigate ten species or groups of species from each of the sites, the method applied during the analyses should, data permitting, allow for further species observed at the sites to be investigated at a later date. It is worth noting, however, that the low densities recorded at the sites for certain species may curtail the scope for any further analyses involving these species.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,1759-4014,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2017-01-01,ZOOREC:ZOOR15510064094,,

The considered scenarios could represent the collisions of offshore cylindrical structures with bow or stern of service vessels or floating objects. Before deriving the formulations, the numerical methods were developed using ABAQUS/Explicit to determine the deformation of these stiffened cylinder structures subjected to dynamic lateral mass impact. Next, rigorous parametric studies were performed on the actual design full-scaled stiffened cylinder examples using the developed numerical method. Based on the rigorous numerical results, new simple design formulations to predict the maximum permanent local dent depth of a stiffened cylinder are derived through a regression study as the function of a non-dimensional energy parameter. The accuracy and reliability of the derived formulations are confirmed by comparison with the available test results, nonlinear FEA and existing analytical, and empirical equations in the literature.

In the area of interest, this unit is characterized by sparse, low resolution, subsurface data typical of the margins of global petroleum provinces, favored for CO2 storage. Such data scarcity leads to uncertainty regarding the complex trap geometries and ultimate CO2 storage capacity. The Rotliegend reservoir, estimated to have porosity and permeability ranges of 11-27% and 0.2 mD-125 mD, respectively, is sealed by Zechstein salt. The salt, predominantly halite, is a proven hydrocarbon seal in the central and southern North Sea hosting oil and gas columns of >140 m (>450 ft) and >150 m (>500 ft). Utilizing 2D-seismic data, boreholes and analogues, we estimate the pore volume of a 5-km(2) 4-way dip-closed structure through Monte-Carlo-based capacity simulations. We estimated storage capacity using published methodologies and compared this against a theoretical total storage calculation analogous to the gas in place equation used in the petroleum industry. We found that different methods yield a capacity range of <10(4) to >10(9) tonnes CO2 where sensitivity analysis indicates variability in reservoir properties to be the dominant control. Thus static estimates based upon Monte-Carlo calculations present no advantage over theoretical pore volume estimations. This leaves 3D dynamic modeling of storage capacity populated by 3D seismic data and direct down-hole measurement of reservoir properties to improve confidence in capacity estimations as the recommended method.",,,,,,,,,2,0,0,0,0,0,2,,,2152-3878,,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Durham, Durham DH1 3LE, EnglandUniv Durham, Durham Energy Inst, Durham DH1 3LE, EnglandUniv Durham, Dept Earth Sci, Durham DH1 3LE, EnglandProgress Energy Ltd, Stonehouse, Glos, England",Progress Energy Ltd,,,2013-06-01,WOS:000328138700007,,

The goal of this paper is to develop a systematic approach to overcome this uncertainty. The likelihood of a failure event is obtained via fault tree analysis, and the associated failure consequences are obtained via event tree analysis. To cope with uncertainties, the fuzzy set theory has been combined with the fault tree analysis and event tree analysis. Financial consequences of offshore pipeline failure are estimated and financial consequences are divided into economic losses, environmental damage, and human health issue. To assess the feasibility of this method, an example of its application in an offshore pipeline containing sour gas is presented. Flash fire, pool fire, and environmental damage are the most known consequences associated with offshore pipeline failure.

Evaluations used a weight-of-evidence approach based on results from bulk phase chemical analyses and laboratory toxicity testing of shell mound cores, in situ field bioassays using caged mussels, and surficial sediment chemistry. Shell mound cores contained elevated concentrations of metals associated with drilling wastes (e.g., Ba, Cr, Pb, and Zn), as well as monocyclic and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). The highest concentrations along with pockets of free oil were associated with the middle cuttings stratum. Sediments composited from all core strata caused significant acute toxicity and bioaccumulation of Ba and PAHs in test organisms during laboratory exposures. In contrast, caged mussels placed at each of the shell mounds for a period of 57-58 days had greater than 90% survival, and there were no significant differences in survival of mussels placed at the shell mounds and corresponding reference sites. While all mussel samples exhibited increases in shell length, whole animal weight, and tissue lipid content, in some cases growth metrics for the shell mound mussels were significantly higher than those for the reference sites. Concentrations of metals, PAHs, and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) in tissues of the shell mound mussels were not significantly different from those at reference sites. The presence of labile aromatic hydrocarbons in shell mound cores and absence of significant contaminant accumulation of tissues of caged mussels indicated that chemical contaminants are not being remobilized from the 4H shell mounds. Surficial bottom sediments near the shell mounds contained elevated Ba concentrations that probably were associated with drilling wastes. However, concentrations did not exhibit clear spatial gradients with distance from the shell mounds. Despite a number of storm events during the mussel exposures, maximum currents were 34 cm s(-1) and unlikely to erode materials from the shell mounds. Thus, Ba distributions in bottom sediments probably were due to episodic disturbance such as platform removal or trawling rather than ongoing erosion and dispersion of shell mound solids by near-bottom currents. These results suggest that, in the absence of physical disturbances, contaminants are expected to remain sequestered in the shell mounds. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

This leads to the necessity for human factors engineering (HFE), which addresses the hazard risks associated with the consequences of human errors. It also improves the operability, maintainability and user acceptance of the facilities or equipment in a holistic manner. Major players in the O&G industry recognise that HFE plays a significant role in ensuring the quality, safety and fitness for purpose of the equipment and facilities utilised. Notwithstanding its importance, neither its implementation in the global offshore O&G industry has been consistent nor has it been structurally and seamlessly deployed within the framework of facilities design and development. Thus, this paper aimed to provide some initial insights into the current state of HFE implementation in the global offshore O&G industry. This included a brief description of its multidisciplinary facets and intent within the sector, while current HFE practices, experiences, lessons learned and its role in the context of facilities development were reviewed and summarised accordingly.

This paper examines the key parameters that determine viable economics for various hybrid GCS-Geothermal energy applications with a focus on Australian GCS flagship sites as case study examples linked with the initial observations from a pilot trial at the SECARB Cranfield CO2 demonstration project in Cranfield, Mississippi, USA. At first approximation, offshore GCS-Geothermal coupling seems unlikely due to well costs and the additional engineering requirements. The Perth Basin provides the best opportunity for GCS-Geothermal direct use for desalination. Whilst none of the case study examples would be ideally suited for GCS-Geothermal, insights gained are used to speculate on what conditions would be required for an economically viable opportunity. A strong enabling economic driver is when a GCS project already includes pressure relief water production as part of its base case. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

However, hydrocarbon exploitation projects can cause significant impacts on the environment. But despite the production of numerous Environmental Impact Statements (EISs) to identify/mitigate such impacts, no study has specifically assessed the quality of EISs for both onshore and offshore oil and gas projects, with tested hypotheses. To address this research gap, our paper, for the first time, develops a modified Lee and Colley evaluation model to assess the quality of 19 sampled oil and gas project EISs produced from 1998 to 2008 in Nigeria. Our findings show that Project Description and Communication of Results are the main areas of strength. However, Environmental Impact Prediction, and Project Decommissioning, were among the key areas requiring attention. A key finding, though, is that Mann-Whitney tests suggest that there is no evidence that the quality of EISs for the latter period (2004-2008) is higher than that of the earlier period (1998-2004). We suggest that periodic systematic review of the quality of submitted/approved EISs (c. every 3-5 years) should be established to monitor trends in EIS quality and identify strong and weak areas. This would help to drive continual improvement in both the EIA processes and the resultant EISs of technical engineering projects. Such reviews have the potential to illuminate some of the underlying problems of, and solutions to, oil and gas exploration, production and transportation, and their related environmental impacts. This suggested change would also be useful internationally, including for the burgeoning exploration and production of unconventional hydrocarbon resources. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

The basic component of our system is the CO2Probe, a new underwater monitoring node which combines sensing, acoustic communications and networking capabilities. CO2Probes are connected via acoustic links in an underwater sensor network which provides robust, real-life communications of the monitored data both in single-hop and multi-hop deployments. The user has a real-time control on the monitoring system, being able to change alarm threshold values and sampling rates. The proposed CO2Net approach overcomes the major limitations of system currently available on the market, and provides a first easy to use, flexible and easy to extend, complete monitoring system for underwater infrastructures, based on the emerging underwater sensor networking paradigm.

Relative sea-level change also influences the architecture of sediments that form continental margin stratigraphy. These sedimentary deposits frequently contain energy and water reserves and can serve as hosts for carbon capture and storage. Improved methods are needed for interpreting and predicting stratigraphic patterns in order to (i) manage these resources and (ii) invert the stratigraphic record for paleo-climatic records, which could inform predictions of future Earth system response to climate change. Recent theoretical work suggests that internally generated processes in sediment transport systems have the capacity to destroy, or shred, external environmental signals prior to locking them into the stratigraphic record. Through a combination of experiments and analysis of field data, the team will determine the necessary rates and magnitudes of relative sea level cycles for them to be recorded in stratigraphy. This work will advance the ability to recover meaningful data about past climate change from coastal stratigraphic datasets and generate predictive models for coastal response to climate change. Recent theoretical work suggests that autogenic processes in sediment transport systems have the capacity to shred signals of environmental and tectonic perturbations prior to transfer to the stratigraphic record. Many argue that changes in Relative Sea Level (RSL) represent the most important boundary condition affecting continental margin transport systems. However, we still lack quantitative theory to explain the necessary properties of RSL cycles in order to store them in stratigraphy, thus limiting the usefulness of stratigraphy for defining paleo-environments. Results from previous experiments suggest that RSL cycles with amplitudes less than one channel depth, and of periodicities less than the amount of time necessary to deposit one channel depth of stratigraphy over a delta-top, are susceptible to signal shredding. The team will test this hypothesis using existing data sets and new laboratory experiments. Quantitative theory and predictions produced from this work will be benchmarked against stratigraphy from the Late Miocene to Quaternary stratigraphy of the Mississippi Delta.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,1424312,,,,,,,,Tulane University,,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:13503768,,

The trap formed along the northern edge of a deep WNW-ESE-trending submarine canyon, which was created by Volgian erosion of intra-Heather, Oxfordian-aged sandstones and then infilled with Draupne Formation shales. This mud-filled canyon forms the top and side seal, with the bottom seal provided by Heather shales. The reservoir comprises mid-Oxfordian deep-water turbidites and sediment gravity flows, which formed in response to tectonic hinterland uplift and erosion of the basin margin, 10-20 km to the east.The Skarfjell discovery contains light oil and gas, and may be subdivided into Skarfjell West, in which the main oil reservoir and gas cap have known contacts, and Skarfjell Southeast, which comprises thinner oil and gas reservoirs with slightly lower pressure and unknown hydrocarbon contacts. The Upper Jurassic Draupne and Heather formations are excellent source rocks in the study area. They have generated large volumes of oil and gas reservoired in fields, and discoveries for which the dominant source rock and its maturity have been established by oil to source rock correlation and geochemical biomarker analysis. The Skarfjell fluids were expelled from mid-mature oil source rocks of mixed Heather and Draupne Formation origin.The recoverable resources are estimated at between 9 and 16 million standard cubic metres (Sm-3) of recoverable oil and condensate, and 4-6 billion Sm-3 of recoverable gas.

Oil industries are always searching for innovative drilling technologies to optimize field development process in a complex structure. Managed pressure drilling (MPD) is now becoming an attractive alternative to the traditional overbalance drilling in complex formation. MPD offered substantial benefits in terms of project economics and reduced non-productive time (NPT). These benefits are substantial in the offshore structure, where any downtime significantly impacts the project cost. MPD is designed to avoid continuous formation influx into the wellbore, and any incidental fluid is contained with a specific predetermined process. MPD used some specialized tools and techniques to enhance traditional kick detection capabilities and circulate formation influx while keeping NPT at the minimum level. Early kick detection is a primary concern for the drilling industry to ensure the safety of the drilling rig, crews, and environmental protection. This research focused on a systematic review of kick detection and mitigation in MPD operation. A review of recent advancements in MPD, various early kick detection methods, comparative study of different kick indicators with their significance, different gas kick models, and risk analysis are analyzed systemically. Several control methods in the MPD operation are summarized. A systematic comparison of different gas kick circulation methods in conventional drilling and MPD is presented in this study. Also, different alternative responses to conventional kick circulation methods are summarized. This work critically analyzed different kick responses of circulating and non-circulating methods, e.g. shut-in, modified pump shut down, increasing in casing pressure and stepwise increase in pump rate. However, all circulation methods are elementary, and no kick circulation method is universally applicable to all drilling operations. Finally, this review emphasized some recent progress and challenges in kick detection on managed pressure drilling.",,,,,,,,,10,0,0,0,1,0,11,,,2523-3963,2523-3971,,,,,,,,,,"Mem Univ Newfoundland, St John, NF, CanadaTexas A&M Univ Qatar, Doha, QatarAmer Univ Cairo, New Cairo, Egypt",,,,2021-02-23,WOS:000617500900004,,

Communities were studied by means of culturable and non-culturable methods at three horizons in the sediment (2-5 cm, 12-15 cm and 25-30 cm) in an area heavily affected by the spill. Most probable number of aerobic hydrocarbon degraders was highest in the upper zone and decreased dramatically with depth. Aromatic oxidizing nitrate-reducing bacteria counts were slightly higher than aerobes in the oxidized layer, and also decreased considerably with depth. Iron-reducing bacteria were barely detectable. The highest counts were obtained for sulfate-reducing bacteria, which represented the most relevant fraction of aromatic oxidizers, being maximal at 12-15 cm depth. The community response to high pollution levels was characterized by an increase in culturable populations active towards crude oil components despite the strong decay in the total cell counts. Analysis of whole 16S rRNA gene libraries obtained from the two sampling times and different depths (1460 sequences in all) showed a predominance of Gamma-and Deltaproteobacteria, which was confirmed by fluorescent in situ hybridization. Desulfobacteraceae was the most abundant group among Deltaproteobacteria, followed by sequences affiliated with the order Myxococcales. All retrieved sequences of this order affiliated with a marine myxobacterial clade. Interestingly, sequences affiliated to the order Desulfarculales constituted half of the Deltaproteobacteria sequences retrieved from the heaviest contaminated sample. Principal coordinates analysis of 16S rRNA gene libraries suggested fluctuation in the community distribution with time. Changes in the abundance of certain groups such as Bacteroidetes contributed to these observed differences. Although predominance of certain metabolic types in each horizon could be delimited, a considerable overlap in the use of electron acceptors was observed, confirming that each selected zone could be influenced by more than one respiratory metabolism.

A numerical model is developed to investigate how sea level rise and coastline changes may impact tides in two coastal-plain estuaries, Chesapeake Bay and Delaware Bay. Despite their different tidal characteristics, the two estuaries display similar responses to the sea level rise and shoreline management scenarios. When hypothetic sea walls are erected at the present coastline to prevent low-lying land from flooding, tidal range increases, with greater amplification in the upper part of the two estuaries. When low-lying land is allowed to become permanently inundated by higher sea level, however, tidal range in both estuaries decreases. Analyses of the tidal energy budget show that the increased dissipation over the shallow water and newly inundated areas compensates for the reduced dissipation in deep water, leading to smaller tidal range. The changes in the tidal range are not proportional to the changes in the mean sea level, indicating a nonlinear tidal response to sea level rise. The ratio of tidal range change to sea level rise varies between -0.05 and 0.1 in Chesapeake Bay and between -0.2 and 0.25 in Delaware Bay. The model results suggest a potential adaptation strategy that uses inundation over low-lying areas to reduce tidal range at up-estuary locations.Plain Language Summary Coastal inundation occurs when sea levels are higher than the normal extent of the tide. Presently, estimates of future coastal inundation due to sea level rise are made by simply adding the expected sea level rise to the present-day tides. However, tides are themselves affected by changes in water depth, thus sea level rise will change the position of high and low tide. In this study, we investigate how sea level rise will change tides in two large coastal waterways, Chesapeake and Delaware Bays. We also investigate how tides will be affected if shoreline protection measures are put in place to prevent rising sea levels from encroaching over low-lying land. We find that if no shoreline protection measures are installed, higher sea levels will reduce tides in both Chesapeake and Delaware Bays. Adding shoreline protection measures however increases the tides, particularly in the upper reaches of both estuaries, where major cities are located.",,,,,,,,,83,3,0,0,27,0,99,,,2169-9275,2169-9291,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Maryland, Ctr Environm Sci, Horn Point Lab, Cambridge, MD 21613 USAGriffith Univ, Griffith Climate Change Response Program, Griffith Ctr Coastal Management, Griffith Sch Engn, Gold Coast, Qld, Australia",,,,2017-05-01,WOS:000404363600023,,

The present study builds on four actual cases located in the North and Norwegian Seas, which differ by the type of oil processed, operating conditions and strategies. The benefits and practical limitations of each measure are discussed based on thermodynamic, economic and environmental factors. Significant energy savings and reductions in CO2-emissions are depicted, reaching up to 15-20%.

Human trash includes plastic, fishing debris, and metal, which have negative effects on marine resources. For example, some trash can be ingested by organisms including birds and turtles, and plastic can break down into small particles that have unique toxic properties. The study of the origins, movement, and consumption of trash in the ocean has provided information about ocean currents and food webs. Research by this investigator has shown that trash in rivers can reach similar densities as in the oceans. However, the sources, movements, and influences on biological systems of human trash in rivers are unknown, and are needed to develop efficient prevention strategies and policies. Also, studying the ecology of trash in rivers may reveal previously unexplored controls on ecosystem structure and function. This study will be conducted in Chicago- and Baltimore-area rivers, and include students from high school, undergraduate, and graduate levels. Trash removal will be used by student teachers to develop lessons for teaching the scientific method across grade levels. This research will examine the ecosystem role of anthropogenic litter (AL) in 3 size classes by adapting fundamental tools used to measure communities of organisms and movement of organic matter. First, the role of large AL will be measured. Urban rivers typically have reduced channel complexity due to straightening and flood management. Large AL may act as an ?artificial reef,? providing habitat complexity and organic matter retention that is otherwise lacking, and thereby enhance biodiversity. Researchers will measure stream organism abundance at naturally occurring debris dams (i.e., wood) and at those generated by large AL. Next, this research will quantify interactions between AL and microbes. Bacteria, fungi, and algae carry out important biological activities in rivers, removing excess nutrients and providing food for insects and fish. Initial studies showed AL has unique microbial communities compared to natural surfaces. Experiments will test how microbes are affected by the structural and chemical properties of AL surfaces. Last, movement of intermediate-sized (e.g., shopping bags), and small AL (e.g., microplastic) will be examined. Initial research showed that AL in rivers is abundant and mobile, with some portion always moving downstream. Because AL attracts common toxic chemicals, its movement may be an overlooked pathway for delivery of toxins downstream and into food webs. This work will quantify inputs, outputs, and re-distribution of toxins on litter surfaces in urban streams.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,1552825,,,,,,,,Loyola University of Chicago,,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:13852199,,

In the injection scenario, 70 million tonnes of CO2 is injected annually over 40 years. A limited sensitivity analysis has been performed. The EOR potential for continuous CO2 injection is estimated to be between 276 and 351 million Sm3. This corresponds to 5.9 and 7.6 % of the oil originally in place depending on the oil price (low/high: 40/120 USD/bbl), the cost of CO2 that the oil producers must pay for all stored CO2 (low/high: 0/50 USD/tonne) and well costs (low/high 25/42 million USD/well). In addition to transportation costs through the main pipeline (8 USD/tonne) specific costs for aquifer deposition also applies (8 USD/tonne). CO2 mass balance calculations show that more CO2 is stored in the oil reservoirs during tertiary flooding compared to the CO2 formed by combustion of the produced oil. The CO2 footprint becomes even more negative when the CO2 stored in aquifers is included in the calculations.

Previous studies were primarily conducted in the marine environment, while notably few studies have investigated lacustrine massive mudrock. Based on core observation in the lacustrine environment of the Jiyang Depression, Bohai Bay Basin, China, massive mudrock is a common deep water fine-grained sedimentary rock. There are two types of massive mudrock. Both types are sharply delineated at the bottom and top contacts, abundant in angular terrigenous debris, and associated with oxygen-rich (higher than 2 ml O-2/L H2O) but lower water salinities in comparison to adjacent black shales. In addition, type 1 is laterally isolated and contains abundant sand injections and contorted layers formed in the depositional process, but type 2 exactly distributes in the distal part of deep water gravity driven sandstone units, and shows scoured bases, high-angle mineral crytsals, and fining-upward trend. It is suggested that type 1 is a muddy mass transport deposit (MMTD) formed by slide, slump, and/or debris flow, and type 2 is a turbiditic mudrock deposited by settling from dilute turbidity currents. A warm and humid climate and high subsidence rate are two main triggering events. Because of its mass movement nature, MMTD preserves the mineralogic composition and organic matter characteristics of the source sediment. By contrast, dilute turbidity currents are able to greatly entrain biochemically formed micrite and planktonic organisms from the water column, and deposit them in the turbiditic mudrock. Because of their different ability to deposit organic matter, MMTD have poor or fair source rock potential, but the turbiditic mudrock is able to be a potentially effective source rock. The minerals in the massive mudrock are disorganized and chaotic, which cause fractures to develop in various directions, thereby, enhancing the vertical migration of oil and gas molecules to horizontal wellbore in shale reservoir exploitation.

An increasing number of OOGPs across the world will be retired and decommissioned in the coming decade. Therefore, a safe and efficient approach in planning the disassembly of the topsides of OOGPs is required. One commonly applied disassembly method is reverse installation, which moves the OOGP modules from the platform deck to a heavy lift vessel (HLV) in reverse order of their installation. Considering the high risk and cost of working offshore, shortening the lift time is crucial. In contrast to the traditional experience-driven lift operations, this paper describes minimizing the lift path for each OOGP module during disassembly, leveraging building information modeling (BIM) technology and an improved A* algorithm. BIM models provide accurate component-based geometric and semantic information that can be used for planning and optimization. However, there has been no previous study on the use of BIM for offshore disassembly. Industry Foundation Classes (IFC), which is a neutral data model of BIM, is used in this study to represent OOGP models. In particular, the IfcBuildingElementProxy entity is used to represent the OOGP components, and the information in IfcBuildingElementProxy is automatically extracted to obtain the location and dimension information of each OOGP module. Then, for a given layout of modules on the removal vessel, the lift path and removal sequence of different modules, with the shortest lift path distance, are obtained. The lift path distance is calculated using the A* algorithm, which has been widely applied in 2D environments and is modified in this study to suit the 3D environment. Finally, the genetic algorithm (GA) technique is applied to optimize the layout plan on the removal vessel by minimizing the total lift path distance. The developed BIM-based framework is illustrated and evaluated through an illustrative example. The results show that the proposed framework can generate and visualize the shortest lift path for each OOGP module directly and automatically, and significantly improve the efficiency of OOGP disassembly.

Consequently, if the leaked hydrocarbons from the process pipework are ignited, it may lead to a catastrophic event, thereby causing significant economic losses, environmental damage, and posing serious threat to the safety of the onboard personnel. In order to avert such a fateful event and to enhance process safety, it is vital to maintain the technical integrity of the topside piping. In regard to this, risk based inspection (RBI) plays a vital role, as the inspection locations and frequency are decided based on the risk of potential failure. However, international standards such as API 570, API 581 and DNV RP-G101 provide limited guidance in regard to inspection of the fatigue degradation of the offshore topside piping. Due to the aforementioned, selection of the fatigue critical piping locations for inspection, is currently done either on the ad-hoc basis or using the three staged Risk Assessment Process (RAP) mentioned in the Energy Institute (EI) guidelines. Nevertheless, it has been revealed that the methodology for stage 1 of the RAP is laborious and time consuming. Thus, to reduce the toil of the practicing inspection engineer and with the aim of mitigating the dearth of RBI methodologies for topside piping fatigue, this manuscript proposes a Fuzzy-Analytical Hierarchy Process (FAHP) centered approach for selecting the fatigue critical piping locations for inspection and repair. The usability of the proposed approach is demonstrated by an illustrative case study. (C) 2016 The Institution of Chemical Engineers. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Deforestation and conversion of these ecosystems continue to be high and have been predicted to result in significant carbon emissions to the atmosphere. Yet few studies have quantified the carbon stocks or losses associated with conversion of these ecosystems. In this study we quantified the ecosystem carbon stocks of three common mangrove types of the Caribbean as well as those of abandoned shrimp ponds in areas formerly occupied by mangrovea common land-use conversion of mangroves throughout the world. In the mangroves of the Montecristi Province in Northwest Dominican Republic we found C stocks ranged from 706 to 1131 Mg/ha. The medium-statured mangroves (3-10 m in height) had the highest C stocks while the tall (>10 m) mangroves had the lowest ecosystem carbon storage. Carbon stocks of the low mangrove (shrub) type (<3 m) were relatively high due to the presence of carbon-rich soils as deep as 2 m. Carbon stocks of abandoned shrimp ponds were 95 Mg/ha or approximate to 11% that of the mangroves. Using a stock-change approach, the potential emissions from the conversion of mangroves to shrimp ponds ranged from 2244 to 3799 Mg CO(2)e/ha (CO2 equivalents). This is among the largest measured C emissions from land use in the tropics. The 6260 ha of mangroves and converted mangroves in the Montecristi Province are estimated to contain 3841490 Mg of C. Mangroves represented 76% of this area but currently store 97% of the carbon in this coastal wetland (3696722 Mg C). Converted lands store only 4% of the total ecosystem C (144778 Mg C) while they comprised 24% of the area. By these metrics the replacement of mangroves with shrimp and salt ponds has resulted in estimated emissions from this region totaling 3.8 million Mg CO(2)e or approximate to 21% of the total C prior to conversion. Given the high C stocks of mangroves, the high emissions from their conversion, and the other important functions and services they provide, their inclusion in climate-change mitigation strategies is warranted.",,,,,,,,,174,8,0,0,116,1,198,,,1051-0761,1939-5582,,,,,,,,,,"Oregon State Univ, Dept Fisheries & Wildlife, Corvallis, OR 97331 USAWatershed Profess Network, Philomath, OR 97370 USACounterpart Int, Arlington, VA 22202 USAAgroFrontera, Montecristi, Dominican Rep",Watershed Profess NetworkCounterpart IntAgroFrontera,,,2014-04-01,WOS:000333242300008,24834737,

Some of these fields are evaluated to have no commercial value if existing oil field development approaches are used, especially while the oil prices remain low. A new alternative field development solution, termed as Subsurface Well Completion (SWC) system, is proposed with the aim to produce oil and gas in a cost-effective manner in UDS. This system primarily consists of four parts: a tethered subsurface platform, the rigid riser, SWC equipment and flexible jumper. Obviously, central to the evaluation and application of the new SWC technology is the inherent risk relative to acceptance level. In particular, an uncontrolled release of hydrocarbons to sea, which may lead to catastrophical consequences involving personnel risk, environmental damage and economic losses, is a main contributor to the total risk and of great concern to the offshore petroleum industry. As for the new SWC system, any failure will not be a direct source of risk for the personnel on the surface installation due to its offset feature. In this context, this paper proposes a quantitative risk assessment (QRA) framework to assess such uncontrolled releases to sea with regard to the SWC system for an oil field in the production phase based on the new Subsurface Tension Leg Production (STLP) facility. According to the QRA results presented in this paper, the identified scenarios representing uncontrolled releases to sea are subsea wellhead leaks, rigid riser leaks, subsurface wellhead leaks, releases from X-mas tree and flexible jumper leaks. Among these scenarios, subsea wellhead is found to be the high-risk area. Compared with the established risk acceptance criteria (RAC), the environmental risk levels for the subsea wellhead's leak lie within the As Low As Reasonably Practicable (ALARP) region while other risks are all below ALARP limits, which means that there is a need for improved consideration of the existing design with regard to the subsea wellhead area, and the corresponding risk reduction measures are proposed. Furthermore, the sources and effects of uncertainties are reviewed and sensitivity studies are carried out to illustrate the effect of some of the important assumptions in the risk model. It can be found that some assumptions made are conservative or optimistic while others are unknown. However, the final QRA results can be regarded as somewhat conservative. This paper concludes that the new SWC technology has a distinct advantage with respect to the leakage duration time in UDS, and thus mitigates the environmental and commercial impacts to a large extent. Besides, relaxed design requirements for the X-mas tree and flexible jumper can be accepted. It is also concluded that there are no serious and major commercial losses for all the identified accidental release scenarios, which is of great importance and attractiveness to oil producers.",,,,,,,,,11,0,0,0,0,0,11,,,,1996-1073,,,,,,,,,,"Dalian Univ Technol, Sch Naval Architecture & Ocean Engn, Dalian 116024, Peoples R ChinaNorwegian Univ Sci & Technol NTNU, Dept Marine Technol, N-7491 Trondheim, NorwayNorwegian Univ Sci & Technol NTNU, Ctr Autonomous Marine Operat & Syst SFF AMOS, N-7491 Trondheim, NorwayNorwegian Univ Sci & Technol NTNU, Ctr Res Based Innovat Marine Operat SFI MOVE, N-7491 Trondheim, NorwayDalian Univ Technol, State Key Lab Struct Anal Ind Equipment, Dalian 116024, Peoples R China",,,,2018-07-06,WOS:000435610300284,,

We used weather-surveillance radar to conduct broad regional assessments of bird response to MBHI activities within the Mississippi Alluvial Valley and the West Gulf Coastal Plain. Across both regions, birds responded positively to MBHI management by exhibiting greater relative bird densities within sites relative to pre-management conditions in prior years and relative to surrounding non-flooded agricultural lands. Bird density at MBHI sites was generally greatest during winter for both regions. Unusually high flooding in the years prior to implementation of the MBHI confounded detection of overall changes in remotely sensed soil wetness across sites. The magnitude of bird response at MBHI sites compared to prior years and to non-flooded agricultural lands was generally related to the surrounding landscape context: proximity to areas of high bird density, amount of forested wetlands, emergent marsh, non-flooded agriculture, or permanent open water. However, these relationships varied in strength and direction between regions and seasons, a finding which we attribute to differences in seasonal bird composition and broad regional differences in landscape configuration and composition. We detected greater increases in relative bird use at sites in closer proximity to areas of high bird density during winter in both regions. Additionally, bird density was greater during winter at sites with more emergent marsh in the surrounding landscape. Thus, bird use of managed wetlands could be maximized by enrolling lands located near areas of known bird concentration and within a mosaic of existing wetlands. Weather-radar observations provide strong evidence that MBHI sites located inland from coastal wetlands impacted by the oil spill provided wetland habitat used by a variety of birds.",,,,,,,,,15,0,0,0,11,0,16,,,1528-7092,1938-5412,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Delaware, Dept Entomol & Wildlife Ecol, Newark, DE 19716 USAUS Geol Survey, Natl Wetlands Res Ctr, Lafayette, LA 70506 USA",,,,2014-05-13,WOS:000333891100002,,

This paper proposes a methodology for obstacle avoidance by AUVs that are equipped with forward-looking sonars (FLSs). The data collected from two FLSs placed in horizontal and vertical orientation are processed in real time to provide obstacle detection information in the xz- and xy-planes, respectively. Due to the necessity of maintaining constant height when employing sidescan sonar (SSS) and lower energy consumption, horizontal avoidance maneuvers are preferred over vertical ones. For the horizontal obstacle avoidance, a two-layer obstacle avoidance algorithm (OAA) contains two different processes, an OAA based on Bandler and Kohout (BK) product of fuzzy relation used as a preplanning method and a reactive approach based on potential field and edge detection methods. The preplanning technique has a clear advantage on a line segment of the path, and the reactive method is more efficient on a curved segment. In case a horizontal approach cannot find a path to safely avoid the obstacle, the reactive vertical approach is activated. A seabed gradient detection technique that allows prediction of seabed and altitude changes up to 40 m ahead of the AUV is presented.

Considering the elevated exposure and sensitivity to the impacts of climate change, the development of oil and gas resources in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR) in Alaska will exacerbate the acute livelihood challenges already being faced by the Indigenous peoples of this region. The tendency to marginalize the rights of Indigenous peoples in US natural resource development planning, moreover, constitutes a missed opportunity for advancing development decision-making toward more effective socio-ecological planning in the context of climate change.

In this study we set up a three-dimensional barotropic hydrodynamic model based on the Finite Volume Coastal Ocean Model to investigate changes in tidal dynamic factors in Jiaozhou Bay from 1935 to 2008. According to the model, the M-2 tide has experienced only minor changes over this period. Land reclamation on a large scale took place between 1935 and 1966, leading to significant hydrodynamic changes during this period. Again according to the model, the M-4 tidal amplitude rose dramatically, by up to 80% at the northeastern part of Jiaozhou Bay, and this has caused a significant increase in the M-2-M-4 tidal-duration asymmetry. Concurrently, the M-2 tidal-energy fluxes across the entrances to both the inner and outer bay were both reduced by more than 50%. From 1966 to 2008, land reclamation was conducted on a smaller scale. Over this period, the M-2 tidal-energy flux continued to decrease but at a relatively smaller rate. Both the M-4 tidal amplitude and M-2-M-4 tidal-duration asymmetry also experienced a gradual decrease during this period, probably due to the reduced M-2 tidal energy, in contrast to the increase between 1935 and 1966. The changes in the M-2-M-4 tidal-duration asymmetry from 1935 to 2008 caused by the land reclamation were reproduced in the model by progressively removing tidal flats from the head of the bay to its mouth. However, the M-2-M-4 tidal-duration asymmetry showed a different variation when the tidal flats were removed progressively in the opposite direction, from the mouth to the head of the bay. Our study shows that the significant increase in the M-2-M-4 tidal-duration asymmetry between 1935 and 1966 was a consequence of the change in bottom friction when the tidal flats were land-filled; advection played only a secondary role.

In this efficiency paradox, high-powered species are inefficient in that they release copious waste, but the ecosystems they inhabit lose almost no organic matter. Systems occupied by more efficient low-powered species suffer greater losses because of less efficient recycling. Over Phanerozoic time, ecosystems have become more productive and increasingly efficient at retaining and redistributing organic matter even as opportunistic and highly competitive producers and consumers gained power and became less efficient. These patterns and trends are driven by natural selection at the level of individuals and coherent groups, which favors winners that are more powerful, active, and wasteful.

Differences in precipitation can affect soil carbon storage either by altering the biotic processes involved in carbon cycling or by altering abiotic processes such as carbon adsorption on soil minerals. We compared the relative effect of water on net primary productivity and decomposition, and on soil weathering and mineralogy in controlling soil carbon storage in forests. Patterns of ecosystem carbon cycling and soil carbon storage were measured in Hawaiian montane forest sites similar in temperature regime, parent material, ecosystem age, vegetation, and topographical relief, while mean annual precipitation alone varied from 2200 to > 5000 mm/yr. Soil carbon storage ranged from 30.9 to 62.5 kg/m(2) and increased by a factor of 1.7 with increased precipitation across the gradient. Neither changes in total secondary minerals nor noncrystalline mineral content could explain increased soil carbon as both decreased with increasing precipitation. Aboveground net primary productivity, soil carbon dioxide flux, and plant litter decomposition rates also decreased with increased precipitation. These data suggest that increased soil carbon storage was not stimulated by an increase in net primary productivity, but instead by a decrease in decomposition rates. Decreased decomposition rates corresponded with low soil reduction-oxidation potentials, suggesting that soil oxygen availability was limiting to microbes, While soil oxygen did not appear to affect plant growth directly, the decline in net primary productivity corresponded with decreased nitrogen availability, a consequence of slower decomposition and nutrient release. Thus, in humid environments the most important effect of variation in water on carbon cycling appears to be its control on the diffusion of oxygen into the soil.",,,,,,,,,132,7,0,0,87,2,154,,,0012-9658,,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Environm Sci Policy & Management, Ecosyst Sci Div, Berkeley, CA 94720 USAUniv Calif Santa Barbara, Dept Geog, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USAStanford Univ, Dept Geol & Environm Sci, Stanford, CA 94305 USA",,,,2001-11-01,WOS:000172139500016,,

This includes more than 200 giant fields in the Middle East. North African basins, mainly in Algeria, Libya, and Egypt, contain 4% of the world's oil and gas reserves and nearly 40 giants. The most recent giant field resides in the offshore Levantine Basin. In this chapter, the region's geological history and petroleum systems are reviewed, including descriptions of the regional habitats and stratigraphy of the main reservoirs and source rocks. The Late Pre-Cambrian to Phanerozoic tectonostratigraphy is characterized by six major phases: (1) basement assembly and Infracambrian extension; (2) development of Cambrian to Carboniferous passive margins; (3) Late Carboniferous to Early Permian Hercynian orogeny; (4) post-Hercynian breakup of Gondwana; (5) collision with Eurasia; and (6) Red Sea rifting and the closing of Neotethys. For most of the Phanerozoic, the terranes of North Africa and Arabia were locked together at the northern rim of Gondwana. They shared a similar geodynamic history and generally similar climates. Their plate margins interacted over time with the water masses of three oceans: Proto-, Paleo-, and Neotethys. Throughout the Paleozoic, the region lay on a wide ramp-like passive margin facing northward toward Paleotethys. The main sediment source was the large hinterland to the south, with prevailing south to north and southeast to northwest-directed paleocurrents. Multiple marine transgressions across a low-relief continental platform were interrupted by at least four glacial events: Late Ordovician (Hirnantian), Silurian, Carboniferous, and Early Permian. Deposition of siliciclastics predominated throughout the Paleozoic whereas carbonates were much less common. The most important tectonic event was the mid-Carboniferous Hercynian composite-orogeny, which caused major uplift and erosion. The Hercynian represented the final closure of Paleotethys and produced many fault blocks and arches that would later host many of the major hydrocarbon accumulations of North Africa and eastern Arabia. The Mesozoic-Cenozoic sedimentary sequence similarly consists of eustatically and tectonically controlled depositional cycles along the newly formed passive margin of Neotethys. Triassic to mid-Cretaceous facies along North Africa are almost everywhere shallow marine, nearshore, deltaic, and continental. Neotethys reached its maximum extent in the Late Cretaceous at which time carbonate sequences dominated. In addition to the Hercynian Orogeny, two other compressional events had major consequences on North Africa-Arabia petroleum systems. The closing of Neotethys began in the late Santonian (similar to 84 Ma) and the convergence between Eurasia and Africa-Arabia sent pulses of compressional deformation across the plate. This corresponded to the first phase of the complex Alpine orogenic cycle and caused folding, basin inversion, and strike-slip faulting along the African-Arabian Neotethyan margin (the Syrian Arc), and thrusting and ophiolite obduction in Oman. Compression was renewed at the end of the Maastrichtian and continued into the early Paleocene, followed by even stronger effects in the Late Eocene. Eruption of the Afar plume at about 31 Ma marked the beginning of a new phase of continental rifting that had dramatic effects on all aspects of the geology of the region.The Gulf of Aden ruptured first in the Early Oligocene, followed by the southern Red Sea in the Late Oligocene. At the Oligocene-Miocene transition, the remainder of the Red Sea north to the Gulf of Suez underwent a regional dike event and accompanying extensional faulting. Initiation of the Gulf of Aqaba-Dead Sea transform plate boundary occurred in the Middle Miocene, completing formation of the independent Arabian plate. The Neotethys Ocean also ceased to exist in the Middle Miocene following a collision between Eurasia and the Arabian plate to form the Bitlis-Zagros suture and fold belt. The Arabian plate was progressively tilted to the northeast as a result of both uplift and rifting of Arabia from Africa, and structural loading of the northeast margin by the Zagros fold belt. Recent tectonic activity is mainly concentrated along the Maghrebian Alpine Belt, the offshore Nile Delta, the Red Sea-East African (or Afro-Arabian) Rifts Province, the Aqaba-Dead Sea-Bekaa sinistral strike-slip fault zone, and some major intra-plate fault zones including the Guinean-Nubian, Aswan, and central Sinai lineaments. Our review of the petroleum systems of North Africa and Arabia is brief and includes only highlights of the hydrocarbon occurrences found across this broad and complex region. Based on the age of source rocks, it is possible to distinguish an Infracambrian Petroleum System, Palaeozoic-related Petroleum Systems, and linked Mesozoic-Cenozoic Petroleum Systems. The sedimentary fill contains numerous source rocks, some of them with exceptional quality and regional distribution, such as the Silurian hot shale. Producing reservoirs are found in both siliciclastics and carbonates. The proximity and juxtaposition of source rocks with thick reservoirs minimized the need for complex oil migration pathways, but also facilitated hydrocarbon expulsion and migration over long distances. Huge amounts of evaporites and shales are present, providing excellent lateral and ultimate top seals. Hydrocarbons are trapped in literally all stratigraphic units from the fractured Neoproterozoic basement to the youngest Pliocene-Quaternary sediments.",,,,,1st International Conference of the Arabian-Geosciences-Union (ARABGU)1st International Conference of the Arabian-Geosciences-Union (ARABGU),"FEB 17-22, 2016FEB 17-22, 2016",Arabian Geosciences Union; Univ Sci & Technol Houari Boumediene; Ctr Res Astron Astrophys & Geophys; Algerian Soc GeophysArabian Geosciences Union; Univ Sci & Technol Houari Boumediene; Ctr Res Astron Astrophys & Geophys; Algerian Soc Geophys,"Algiers, ALGERIAAlgiers, ALGERIA",16,1,0,0,0,0,17,,,2197-9545,,978-3-319-96794-3; 978-3-319-96793-6,,,,,,,,,"Apache Egypt Co, Cairo, Egypt",Apache Egypt Co,,,2019-05-27,WOS:000467199600006,,

The GLEAMS project is developing technology with which marine vessels can achieve the very highest standards of sulphur and Nox emissions, slash their carbon emissions, and reduce costs simultaneously. It does this by allowing vessels to burn a widely available but under-used fuel, glycerol, in conventional marine diesel engines, requiring only modest additional equipment that can be easily retro-fitted.Glycerol is produced as a by-product of biofuel production. As biofuel capacity increases, the amount of glycerol produced also increases. The marine industry is ideally-placed to exploit this resource: not only is the non-toxic and non-volatile nature of glycerol highly valuable in a marine environment, but also the relatively low energy content of glycerol can be easily accommodated in the hull space of many vessel types.At present, the technology for GLEAMS is being deployed into the constructuction sector in the form of combined heat & power plant. The project will marinise this technology and explore how it can best be adapted to meet marine safety & environmental requirements. It will also initiate new consortia, led by end users such as offshore wind farm operators, to steer the subsequent development into market-ready products.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,131281,,,,,,,,Marine South East Limited,Marine South East Limited,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:15398351,,

While environmental effects monitoring programs are being conducted by industry to meet regulatory requirements, and by government agencies in relation to cumulative impact assessment, nobody feels the importance of understanding the environmental changes resulting from oil and gas activities more than the people that live in coastal communities. With the settlement of land claims in Canada's arctic, a co-management approach to resource allocation and use, research, and monitoring has been established. This new form of governance in the arctic is dependent on a high level of community involvement and consultation. The Tariuq (Ocean) community-based monitoring program was piloted in Tuktoyaktuk and Aklavik in 2001 as one of the initiatives under the Beaufort Sea Integrated Management Planning Initiative. It is consistent with the principles outlined in Canada's Oceans Act and Canada's Oceans Strategy. The program engages coastal communities in monitoring the health of the Beaufort Sea through their participation in the selection of indicators, conducting of monitoring activities, review of monitoring results, and finally the dissemination of the findings back to the community. Tariuq concurrently, builds capacity within the communities and presents an opportunity to engage and train youth in scientific sampling methods.

Our view of the landscape, and the actions we take to use and value it, are steered by a complex mix of factors, many of which are often unconscious. Some of these factors are related to the rise of technology-mediated experiences changing the way we interact with nature, whilst others are imposed on us when decisions have to be made about resource management and sustainable urbanisation. Increasingly, decision-makers are gathering around issues about the Earth, our environment and the nexus with society, Do we want fracking or wind farms in this place?; Should a mine be opened or closed?; Should we bury our waste here?; Are we doing enough about climate change? Addressing these complex questions requires a holistic approach to both understanding the problem and the actions we take to solve it. Decision-making requires an evidence base, but this has to be greater than the sum of its parts, requiring knowledge across seemingly disparate aspects of science and society. This project aims to contribute to an evidence base to support decision making about landscape, as well as open up dialogue about the contribution and importance of the arts in environmental research. Increasingly, local-to-global challenges are being addressed by integrating knowledge from seemingly disparate disciplines, including the arts, even if collaborations between artists and 'other' researchers are slow to be endorsed. In this project, collaborating artists and geoscientists will develop new ways of working and co-create new artworks. Their focus is on the evolution of Scotland's landscape, particularly the balance between landscape conservation and adaptation to changing culture, communities and societal needs.On the surface, the core creative team of this project may seem an unlikely grouping to develop an arts-based network - a volcanologist, marine geoscientist and a soil hydrologist. Yet all three are practicing artists, and regularly use creative approaches to develop and communicate their research. The team are collaborating with award-winning contemporary sculpture park, Jupiter Artland, and Edinburgh's science centre, Dynamic Earth, to develop a network of artists and geoscientists and undertake innovative transdisciplinary activities to inspire participants to think, learn, and create in unfamiliar territories. By fostering an open attitude towards the way the network sees and represents the landscape, their aim to more effectively exchange knowledge with stakeholder groups attentive to landscape decision-making in the UK.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,AH/T006145/1,,,,,,,,NERC British Geological Survey,,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:15311917,,

Major accident events were crane accidents and falling objects, relating to the most dominant accident type: 'Struck by'. The main actors in these events were drillers and operators. Generally, TRACEr proved very useful in identifying major task errors. However, the taxonomy was less useful in identifying both equipment errors and errors due to failures in safety critical control barriers and recovery measures. Therefore, a modified version of the tool named Technique for the Retrospective and Predictive Analysis of Cognitive Errors for the Oil and Gas Industry (TRACEr-OGI) was proposed and used.

Chemical analysis showed that the weathering percentage of residual oils was 43.7 +/- 2.59%, which was the driving factor for sedimentation of OSA.

Here we describe how OTEC could be modified to provide a large source of CO2-emissions-negative energy while also allowing heat removal from the surface ocean, helping to directly counter ocean/atmosphere warming. Most OTEC energy potential is far offshore, thus the conversion of the produced electricity to a chemical energy carrier such as H-2 or derivatives is required. This can be achieved by employing a method of electrochemically generating H-2 that also consumes CO2, converting the carbon to a common form of ocean alkalinity. The addition of such alkalinity to the ocean would provide high-capacity carbon storage while countering the chemical and biological effects of ocean acidification. For each gigawatt (GW) of continuous electric power generated over one year by the preceding negative-emissions OTEC (NEOTEC), roughly 13GW of surface ocean heat would be directly removed to deep water, while producing 1.3 x 10(5) tonnes of H-2/yr (avoiding 1.1 x 10(6) tonnes of CO2 emissions/yr), and consuming and storing (as dissolved mineral bicarbonate) approximately 5 x 10(6) tonnes CO2/yr. The preceding CO2 mitigation would result in an indirect planetary cooling effect of about 2.6 GW. Such negative-emissions energy production and global warming mitigation would avoid the biophysical and land use limitations posed by methods that rely on terrestrial biology.",,,,,,,,,34,1,0,0,5,0,36,,,1364-0321,1879-0690,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Inst Marine Sci, 1150 High St, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA3217 Jingle Pot Rd, Nanaimo, BC V9R7C6, Canada",,,,2018-12-28,WOS:000441614300019,,

From the eight microalgae strains selected, Tetraselmis suecica showed the highest removal rates of about 100% and 54% in seawater and PW, respectively. Suspect screening analysis using liquid chromatography coupled to high-resolution mass spectrometry (LC-HRMS) allowed the identification of 12 isomeric intermediates generated coming from biotransformation mechanisms. Among them, the intermediate [OH-BAC(C12)] was found as the most intense compound generated from BAC(C12), while the intermediate [2OH-BAC(C14)] was found as the most intense compound generated from BAC(C14). The suggested chemical structures demonstrated a high reduction on their amphiphilic properties, and thus, their tendency to be adsorbed into sediments after water discharge.

At present India's estimated resource base is 28 BMT of O+OEG and proven in-place reserve is about 10MMT of O+OEG.Here I discussed geological setting, petroleum geology and future perspective of each basin under Cat I & II. Presently attention is given to the unconventional sources of hydrocarbons like coalbed methane or CBM, shale gas, shale oil and gas hydrates in view of the depleting hydrocarbon reserves. In India also these frontiers are targeted. Exploration of CBM is progressing in a big way while investigation for other sources has started.Five frontier areas have been identified for intensified exploration: (1) Deep offshore basins of Bay of Bengal and Arabian Sea within the Indian economic zone, (2) Andaman fore-arc and back-arc basins, (3) Subthrust belt below the frontal zone of Assam-Arakan Schuppen belt, (4) Tripura-Mizoram Accretionary Prism, and (5) Mesozoic sediments below Deccan Trap in Gujarat.",,,,,,,,,26,1,0,0,6,0,27,,,0370-0046,0370-0046,,,,,,,,,,"201-C,ISM House, Bombay 400101, Maharashtra, India",,,,2012-11-23,BCI:BCI201200760497,,

To address a shortage of detailed studies of natural variation, we examined drivers of Spartina alterniflora stem allometry and productivity in seven marshes across three regions in southern Louisiana. Live-stem allometry varied spatially and seasonally, generally with short stems weighing more (and tall stems weighing less) in the summer and fall, differences that persist even after correcting for flowering. Strong predictive relationships exist between allometry parameters representing emergent stem mass and mass accumulation rates, suggesting that S.alterniflora populations navigate a trade-off between larger mass at emergence and faster rates of biomass accumulation. Aboveground production and belowground production were calculated using five and four approaches, respectively. End-of-season aboveground biomass was a poor proxy for increment-based production measures. Aboveground production (Smalley) ranged from 390 to 3,350gm(-2)year(-1) across all marshes and years. Belowground production (max-min) was on average three times higher than aboveground; total production ranged from 1,400 to 8,500gm(-2)year(-1). Above- and belowground production were both positively correlated with dissolved nutrient concentrations and negatively correlated to salinity. Synthesis: Interannual variation in water quality is sufficient to drive above- and belowground productivity. The positive relationship between nutrients and belowground production indicates that inputs of nutrients and freshwater may increase salt marsh carbon storage and ecosystem resilience to sea level rise.",,,,,,,,,23,0,0,0,21,0,26,,,2045-7758,,,,,,,,,,,"Louisiana Univ Marine Consortium, Chauvin, LA 70344 USA",Louisiana Univ Marine Consortium,,,2017-12-15,WOS:000415900800039,29187999,

They may also pose significant geohazard where they overly conventional oil and gas production targets. The genesis of such accumulations is not well known and the characterization of the reservoirs is difficult. Thus, integrate characterization using 3D seismic interpretation, well logs, and geotechnical analyses are vital. The present study is the first detailed description of a fractured gas hydrate reservoir in the Kutei basin, offshore Indonesia.In this study, vertical fluid flow features (such as mud volcanoes and chimney structures) and other indicators of gas hydrate occurrence (including Bottom Simulating Reflectors (BSRs) and high-resistivity zones) are interpreted over a region of 500 km(2). Seismic amplitude anomalies provide evidence of gas migration that has reached the seafloor. An interpreted double BSR below a mud volcano is inferred to indicate thermogenic gas present in the shallow sections. Geological and geotechnical analyses show overpressure associated with gas migration across the base of gas hydrate stability zone (BGHSZ) results in the formation of hydraulic and pneumatic fracturing. Seismic and well logs data indicate that the vertical migration of ascending free gas results in large-size macro-fractures whereas free gas accumulation below less permeable hydrated sediments allows for the generation of local small micro fractures. Consequently, the fractures play roles as conduits and reservoirs for gas hydrate accumulations.Hydrate saturation was estimated from seismic and well log data by using seismic inversion and Archie equation, respectively. Gas hydrate is inferred to uniformly occur above the base of hydrate stability zone and its average thickness is estimated to be approximately 30 m. The gas hydrate is estimated to occupy generally 5-10% by volume in micro-fracture reservoirs, with as high as 30-35% near the top of macro fracture reservoirs. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

The de-oiling of produced water is initially achieved in the primary separation processes using gravity-based multi-phase separators, which can effectively handle large amounts of oil-well fluids but may struggle with the efficient separation of small dispersed oil particles. Thereby hydrocyclone systems are commonly employed in the downstream Produced Water Treatment (PWT) process for further reducing the oil concentration in the produced water before it can be discharged into the ocean. The popularity of hydrocyclone technology in the offshore oil and gas industry is mainly due to its rugged design and low maintenance requirements. However, to operate and control this type of system in an efficient way is far less simple, and alternatively this task imposes a number of key control challenges. Specifically, there is much research to be performed in the direction of dynamic modelling and control of de-oiling hydrocyclone systems. The current solutions rely heavily on empirical trial-and-error approaches.

The majority of process research tends to consider improvements in performance, but with less emphasis on how to realize implementation. For control methods to be successfully applied offshore, the methods must be sufficiently simple, trustworthy, and transparent. This is mainly due to the severe consequence of incidences offshore. As it is ultimately the operators that decide which control methods are toggled on/off, the operators need to be aware of the control's behavior. The focus of this paper is not process performance, nor control theory, but rather how to convey the status, state, and action of the controllers to the offshore operators. A design approach is given for displaying and explaining the control for the operators. The is based on uniting the fast prototyping capability of Simulink Real-Time with the graphical capabilities of a Human Machine Interface system. As a case study, experiments are carried out to compare Model Predictive Control to conventional Proportional Integral Derivative control on a scaled offshore pilot-plant, which can emulate different separation processes at the topside of offshore oil & gas installations.

Additional data and new algorithms for reconstructing the history of peat carbon accumulation and the timing of peatland initiation increased the estimate of total northern peat carbon stocks from 545 Gt to 1,055 Gt of carbon. Further, the post-glacial increases in peatland initiation rate and carbon accumulation rate are more abrupt than previously reported. Peatlands have been a strong carbon sink throughout the Holocene, but the atmospheric partial pressure of carbon dioxide has been relatively stable over this period.

After the BP Deepwater Horizon accident, several investigation committees recommended to reexamine the United States' existing regulatory approaches by integrating more sophisticated risk assessment and risk management practices. It has been observed that this type of reactive changes in regulation sometimes give more focus on the causes of a particular accident rather than considering possible future hazards unrelated to that particular accident. There are primarily two approaches of the offshore oil/gas industry's regulatory regime; while the United States' regulatory system is the more prescriptive-based, the United Kingdom's approach is performance-based. The National Commission on the BP Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill and Offshore Drilling Accident recommended changing U.S. regulatory regime to a proactive, risk-based approach which could be similar to the Safety Case approach of the North Sea. The Safety Case approach of the U.K. is considered successful in minimizing accidents in the North Sea region. The objective of this study is to perform an evaluation and comparison between the United States' prescriptive-based regulatory approaches and the United Kingdom's performance-based regulatory approaches to understand their advantages and disadvantages. Then, this study presents an analysis of major accident histories under both regulatory regimes and discusses their effectiveness in reducing accidents. The study has found that there are both advantages and disadvantages in both the regulatory regimes and with available data, it is difficult to conclude with certainty that one regulatory regime is better than the other.

Based on the Newton-Eulerian method, the nonlinear dynamic model of mud-penetrator is established, and the infiuence of guiding angle, geological features, and propelling force on steering process is analyzed through simulation. The simulation results show that the steering process of underwater mud-penetrator is the compound movement of the drill bit translation and deflection. The reduction of the guiding angle and the increase of the propulsive force can effectively improve the guiding ability of the non-excavation drill bit. As the guiding angle decreases pi/12-pi/15, the deflection angle of the drill bit is increased by 2 degrees-3 degrees, and as propulsion increases 500 N, the deflection angle of the drill bit is increased by 3 degrees. The area of the guiding plate also has a great infiuence on the guiding ability of the drill bit, and the deflection angle is inversely proportional to the area of the drill guiding plate. The deflection angle is more sensitive to soft geological changes.

Design concepts have also been developed for a complete process and subsea storage facility for fields remote from existing infrastructures.[GRAPHICS]A comparison of buoy based solutions compared with existing technologies will be presented to identify where the significant Gaper advantages can be realised together with Opex analysis for both NPV and life cycle cost profiles. Issues chat affect system availability and the sensitive issue of boardability will also be addressed.

The deep draft vessel intends to induce wave shielding effect to reduce the motions of the downstream jack up type unit during the initial phase of its onsite installation, while its legs/spudcans are not yet touching the seabed and it is still in free floating condition. In general, the more the motion of the jack up type unit is reduced during the initial phase of its onsite installation, the more its onsite installation capability is enhanced. ANSYS AQWA is utilized to analyze the motions of the two floating bodies, the deep draft vessel and the jack up type unit, as well as the wave shielding effect for various wave periods and incident angles. In the analysis, fluid is assumed ideal, and no viscous effect is considered in the calculation of all the motions of the two floating bodies. Pitch and heave motion RAOs (Response Amplitude Operator) of the jack up unit with or without the deep draft vessel placing upstream are compared to examine the wave shielding effect. In the study, a parametric study for a range variation of the principal dimensions of the two floating bodies is performed to determine suitable principal dimensions for the deep draft vessel and the feasibility of the proposed concept. In addition, pitch and heave motion RAOs of the deep draft vessel at wave incident angles of 0 degrees similar to 30 degrees are also analyzed to evaluate its seakeeping performance. From the results of the study, it is found that the vessel with deeper draft (>= 12.5 m) is more effective to induce wave shielding effect in waves with period of 5-7 s. The deeper the draft of the vessel, the greater the wave shielding effect, and the more motion reduction to the downstream jack up type unit in waves with period of 5-7 s. It is also found that, in waves with period of 5-7 s and at incident angles of 0 degrees similar to 30 degrees , the vessel with deeper draft has better seakeeping performance. Since the most common waves in the wind farm zone offshore of the Taichung Harbor Taiwan are of 6-7 s in period, the feasibility of the concept of placing a deep draft vessel upstream a jack up type unit to reduce the motion and enhance the onsite installation capability of the jack up type unit operating in that area is demonstrated.",,,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,,,0029-8018,,,,,,,,,,,"Natl Taiwan Ocean Univ, Dept Syst Engn & Naval Architecture, Keelung, TaiwanNatl Taiwan Ocean Univ, Ctr Excellence Ocean Engn, Keelung, TaiwanNatl Taiwan Ocean Univ, Dept Harbor & River Engn, Keelung, Taiwan",,,,2021-01-12,WOS:000597316900113,,

Over the 10 yr preceding the spill, we monitored the breeding and the dynamics of the Illas Cies population. We performed 1000 simulations of the population dynamics using the population parameters and their variability for the pre-spill period. The number of breeding pairs counted in 2003 was lower than any of the values predicted by the simulation models, suggesting that population parameters changed after the 'Prestige' wreck. Environmental conditions cannot explain the observed effects because weather conditions were far from severe in 2003. The analysis of shag casualities showed that despite the extensive oiling of Illas Cies and nearby waters it is unlikely that shags were killed in large numbers. Nevertheless, the shag feeding grounds around Illas Cies, which are mainly sandy bottoms, were continuously exposed to oil pollution throughout the shag breeding season as revealed by the high levels of pollutants in sediments, plankton, and other organisms. In the pre-spill years, shags showed low seasonal dietary variation, feeding mainly on sandeels. Nevertheless, in 2003, there was a dietary shift with a lower occurrence of sandeel that, together with sandeel fishery data, indicate lower sandeel availability at foraging areas. In addition, reproductive performance in 2003 was significantly lower and chick condition was poorer compared to the pre-spill years. When all this information is taken into account, the picture that emerges strongly suggests that the European Shag population in Illas Cies is suffering a negative impact of an indirect nature mediated through a reduction on the availability of a highly preferred forage-fish.",,,,,,,,,43,2,0,0,41,0,50,,,0171-8630,1616-1599,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Vigo, Fac Ciencias, Dept Ecol & Biol Anim, Vigo 36310, Spain",,,,2005-01-01,WOS:000233750000021,,

Fourteen safety factors are used as the basis of performance evaluation. To generate the safety score of each safety factor, weights of the indicators grouped under the safety factor are first multiplied with the compliance levels assigned to the respective indicators. The products of weights and compliance levels are then summed up, yielding the safety score. The scores of safety factors serve as inputs of the fuzzy expert system to determine the overall safety performance of an offshore oil and gas platform.The scoring and fuzzy expert systems are tested on ten offshore oil platforms in Malaysia. All the platforms tested meet the status of 'compliant' defined by the rules of the expert system. The crisp outputs correspond well with the total safety scores of the platforms. However, irregularities are observed in the crisp outputs when tested with various compliance scenarios, indicating that rules set by the experts have larger effect on the outputs than the total safety scores obtained. All scenarios of membership function used for the inputs and outputs do not demonstrate significant difference in the R-squared values obtained from the plots of total safety scores against crisp outputs.This study contributes to identification of the most appropriate set-up of fuzzy expert system which can be integrated with this framework to permit integrative safety performance evaluation for early warning provision and performance benchmarking.

Using remote sensing, with laser Doppler anemometer (Lidar) systems, has obviated the need for expensive offshore tower construction historically needed to measure the vertical wind profile, and reduced the uncertainties introduced by traditional single point anemometers, which can often suffer from bad positioning (obstruction) and lack of calibration. Similarly, accurate characterization of the wave environment for offshore facilities is an integral part of planning, design and operations. Remote sensing with new wave radar systems allows remote wave field observation, reducing data contamination associated with traditional upward/horizontal-looking acoustic meters, as well as complications in wave buoy deployment.

Prior to each famine: (1) there were very few ways that people could obtain a living in the worst affected regions; (2) livelihoods in famine stricken communities came to depend on highly specialized agro-ecosystems that were sensitive to environmental change; (3) institutions failed to provide adequate safety nets to protect livelihoods from failure. This analysis suggests that vulnerability to climate change in food systems can be assessed by looking at agro-ecosystems, livelihoods and institutions.

A jacket is a supporting structure for deck facilities, stabilized by piles driven through it to the seabed. In a jacket design, operational and environmental loads are very important and must be intensively investigated to secure the stability of structures during their service life, as well as installation phase. The main purpose of this research is to evaluate the results of physical modeling for the launch operation of jackets from barge into the sea, as the most hazardous stage in the installation of a platform, and compare them to those of numerical modeling. Both physical and numerical modeling parameters are described and they are examined on a prototype platform, i.e., Balal oil field production and living quarter platform that is a 1700 tone, eight-legged jacket located in the center of Persian Gulf, some 100 km distance from Iranian Lavan Island. It is found that both numerical and physical methods can describe the motion of the barge similarly well, but some differences are traced in the motion of jacket. The inequalities are, then, appeared to be due to the Froude-type parameters applied for modeling purpose. One notable fact investigated in this research is the necessity for choosing Reynolds-Froude type in the physical modeling of the launch, instead of Froude type. This is because, in addition to the importance of gravitational and inertial forces, the viscosity affects the drag hydrodynamic force, as well. It should be noted that viscosity and consequently drag coefficient in Froude type modeling cannot be quite applicable and this causes the difference observed between the results of physical and numerical modeling. Although there have been so many jacket launching designed and probably their physical models have been tested, but to the best of our knowledge from the literature, there was found no study on Reynolds-Froude physical modeling of jacket launch phenomenon. If one is interested in practicing a Reynolds-Froude physical modeling, it could be done either in a centrifuge test or by using a fluid with lower viscosity dependent on the scale of model, or even by finding a fluid (with new viscosity and new density) and a new gravity to have simultaneously the Froude and the Reynolds similarity laws satisfied.",,,,,,,,,2,0,0,0,0,0,2,,,0892-7219,,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Tehran, Dept Civil Engn, Tehran, Iran",,,,2008-08-01,WOS:000257795900004,,

We combined these estimates with soil accretion rates derived from the literature and wetland area estimates to calculate surface soil carbon pools and accumulation rates. Wetlands in the northern Gulf of Mexico coastal region potentially store 34-47 Mg C ha(-1) and could potentially accumulate 11,517 Gg C year(-1). These estimates provide important information that can be used to incorporate the value of wetlands in the northern Gulf of Mexico coastal region in future wetland management decisions related to global climate change. Estimates of carbon sequestration potential should be considered along with estimates of other ecosystem services provided by wetlands in the northern Gulf of Mexico coastal region to strengthen and enhance the conservation, sustainable management, and restoration of these important natural resources.",,,,,,,,,45,1,0,0,29,0,56,,,0923-4861,1572-9834,,,,,,,,,,"US EPA, Gulf Ecol Div, Gulf Breeze, FL 32561 USA",,,,2014-06-11,WOS:000335908600006,,

Because pilots need to transition from automated flight to a manually flown night visual segment during arrival, the approach and landing phases cause great concern. Despite this, in Brazil, regulatory changes have been sought to allow for the execution of offshore night flights because of the rapid expansion of the petroleum industry. This study explores the factors that affect safety during night visual segments in Brazil using 28 semi-structured interviews with offshore helicopter pilots, followed by a template analysis of the narratives. The relationships among the factors suggest that flawed safety oversights, caused by a combination of lack of infrastructure for night flights offshore and declining training, currently favor spatial disorientation on the approach and near misses when close to the destination. Safety initiatives can be derived on the basis of these results. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Degradation of these compounds largely depends on the activity of sedimentary microbial communities linked to biogeochemical cycles, in which abundant elements such as iron and sulfur are shuttled between their oxidized and reduced forms. Here we show that introduction of a small electrically conductive graphite rod (the electrochemical snorkel) into an oil-contaminated River Tyne (UK) sediment, so as to create an electrochemical connection between the anoxic contaminated sediment and the oxygenated overlying water, has a large impact on the rate of metabolic reactions taking place in the bulk sediment. The electrochemical snorkel accelerated sulfate reduction processes driven by organic contaminant oxidation and suppressed competitive methane-producing reactions. The application of a comprehensive suite of chemical, spectroscopic, biomolecular and thermodynamic analyses suggested that the snorkel served as a scavenger of toxic sulfide via a redox interaction with the iron cycle. Taken as a whole, the results of this work highlight a new strategy for controlling biological processes, such as bioremediation, through the manipulation of the electron flows in contaminated sediments.

Situational awareness (SA) describes the person's perception, comprehension, and prediction in dynamic environments. SA is critical in time-sensitive decision making, which may be especially pertinent for kick-detection and blowout mitigation. This paper presents the analyses of multiple objective SA measures in an immersive training environment. The SA for a sample of engineering-in-training students (n = 13) was measured using a well control incident simulator. The data analyses include knowledge tests, a voice log analysis, usability measures, check-lists compliance, pre/post performance surveys, and eye-tracking data. The results show that task knowledge (e.g. current pressure readings, current bit depth) was predictive of overall blowout mitigation performance. Further, the usability results provide some preliminary insights into task risk perceptions, task difficulty, and perceptions of communication.

Due to these processes the height of the dams will have to be increased for centuries to come, because the land behind the levees cannot grow in elevation anymore with the rising of the sea. Maintenance of the civil-engineering structures, and mitigating their unpredictable impacts on ecosystems, involve very high recurrent costs. The chance of flooding is reduced, but the potential damage after a storm flood is enlarged: seawalls and dykes provide a false sense of safety against flooding. Changes in the role of agricultural use in the European context, offer an opportunity to abandon arable fields and to retrocede them to the sea in order to absorb tidal energy and to allow the land to rise concomitant with the sea. A cost-benefit analysis of this approach should assess the direct and indirect economic values, as well as the non-use (intrinsic) values, whereby public engagement in management questions, facilitates decision-making processes. Reversible and resilient economic measures within the limits of the natural processes are preferable. A future, speculative perspective is an urbanised landscape, where people and investments are located in safe places, e.g. on floating, or sea-encircled artificial dwelling-mounds, surrounded by a landscape that is ruled by the forces of nature. New approaches such as developed in the Westerschelde offer flexible solutions to flooding problems, and are worth a broader evaluation.

These interviews indicated that effective mitigation methods and techniques originate from both the organization and the worker. Current industry practices and potential recommendations to manage worker fatigue in the oil and gas operations are provided. These practices and recommendations include improving sleep quality through effective sleep-cabin arrangements, reducing physical and cognitive workload through improved work/tool/environment designs, and facilitating periodic fatigue monitoring.TECHNICAL ABSTRACT Background: Offshore drilling in the oil and gas industry presents a fast-paced, hazardous work environment that can evoke states of fatigue or tiredness. Purpose: To gain insight into the day-to-day experience and mitigation of fatigue among workers in this industry. Methods: Interviews were conducted with eleven offshore personnel working on an offshore rig in the Gulf of Mexico. Qualitative data analysis of interview transcripts provided an initial code set for categorizing the data. Results: The coding process, enhanced using visualizations, revealed some themes that highlighted dimensions of fatigue, such as physical and cognitive aspects, in addition to the more commonly recognized source of fatigue, namely shiftwork. These themes also emphasized potential fatigue mitigation strategies that were either organizationally or individually driven. Such strategies include needs for improved coordination around shift work schedules and sleeping arrangements, and a widespread perceived obligation to work past fatigue, despite being encouraged to report symptoms. Conclusions: These results provided a better understanding of worker perceptions of fatigue sources, reporting challenges, and adoption of personal mitigation strategies among oil and gas workers. These results can also inform specific organizational opportunities for mitigating fatigue in offshore drilling operations. Potential strategies that encourage periodic fatigue monitoring, improve sleep quality, and reduce work-related physical and cognitive overload should be examined for effective adoption in this industry.",,,,,,,,,3,0,0,0,0,0,4,,,2472-5838,2472-5846,,,,,,,,,,"Texas A&M Univ, Dept Ind & Syst Engn, College Stn, TX 77843 USATexas A&M Univ, Dept Environm & Occupat Hlth, College Stn, TX 77843 USA",,,,2019-06-18,WOS:000470064500004,,

Results indicate a decline in the overall flaring activity during the time period considered in this work, although single sites can show positive flaring trends. The ATSR derived flaring time series has been compared to the crude oil production data provided by the US Energy Information Administration (EIA), showing very good agreement in terms of trend and seasonal behaviour. We present a simple inversion scheme aimed at the evaluation of the flame parameters (temperature and size) from night-time shortwave, middle and thermal infrared ATSR measurements, and results are discussed in detail. Finally, the possibility to estimate flaring efficiency from satellite measurements and from detailed technical information on flaring devices is envisaged.

Self-completion questionnaire surveys were administered in two organisations and sectors: (1) a huge regional hospital in Norway that offers a wide range of hospital services. and (2) a large petroleum company that produces oil and gas worldwide. In total, 1919 and 1806 questionnaires were returned from the hospital and petroleum organisation, with response rates of 55 percent and 52 percent, respectively. Using a split sample procedure principal factor analysis and confirmatory factor analysis revealed six identical cross-industrial measurement concepts in independent samples five measures of safety climate and one of safety behaviour. The factors' psychometric properties were explored with satisfactory internal consistency and concept validity. Thus, a common cross-industrial structural model was developed and tested using structural equation modelling (SEM). SEM revealed that a cross-industrial structural model could be identified among health care workers and offshore workers in the North Sea. The most significant contributing variables in the model testing stemmed from organisational management support for safety and supervisor/manager expectations and act ions promoting safety. These variables indirectly enhanced safety behaviour (stop working in dangerous situations) through transitions and teamwork across units, and teamwork within units as well as learning, feedback, and improvement. Two new safety climate instruments were validated as part of the study: (1) Short Safety Climate Survey (SSCS) and (2) Hospital Survey on Patient Safety Culture-short (HSOPSC-short). Based on development of measurements and structural model assessment, this study supports the possibility of a common safety climate structural model across health care and the offshore petroleum industry.

Moreover, overtime (additional to the standard 84-h week) is not uncommon among offshore personnel. Evidence from onshore research suggests that long work hours and adverse environmental characteristics are associated with sleep impairments, and consequently with health and safety risks, including accidents and injuries. However, little is known about the extent to which long hours and a demanding work environment combine synergistically in relation to sleep.The present study sought to address this issue, using survey data collected from offshore day-shift personnel (N = 551). The multivariate analysis examined the additive and interactive effects of Overtime and measures of the psychosocial/physical work environment (job demands, job control, supervisor support, and physical stressors) as predictors of sleep outcomes during offshore work weeks. Control variables, including age and sleep during leave weeks, were also included in the analysis model.Sleep duration and quality were significantly impaired among those Who worked overtime (54% of the participants) relative to those who worked only 12-h shifts. A linear relationship was found between long overtime hours and short sleep duration; personnel who worked >33 h/week overtime reported <6 h/day sleep. Significant interactions were also found; sleep duration was negatively related to job demands, and positively related to supervisor support, only among personnel who worked overtime. Poor sleep quality was predicted by the additive effects of overtime, low support and an adverse physical environment. These findings highlight the need to further examine the potential health and safety consequences of impaired sleep associated with high overtime rates offshore, and to identify the extent to which adverse effects of overtime can be mitigated by favourable physical and psychosocial work environment characteristics.

Comparisons with aerial observations of the oil slick at the time of the incident, and subsequent model simulations, indicate that the OILTRANS model is capable of accurately predicting the transport and fate of the oil slick.

Production from fields in water deeper than 1800 m is now a reality. The use of long deepwater risers that conduct production from multiple wellheads on the sea-floor to the surface predisposes the system to severe slugging in the riser for a wide range of flow rates and seabed topography. Considering the length of the deepwater risers, the problem is expected to be more severe than in production systems installed in shallower waters. Severe slugging could occur at a high pressure, with the magnitude of the pressure fluctuations so large as to cause a shorter natural-flow period with subsequent consequences, such as premature field abandonment, loss of recoverable reserves, and earlier-than-planned deployment of boosting devices.In this study, a novel idea to lessen or eliminate severe slugging in pipeline/riser systems has been investigated. The principle of the technique is to transfer the pipeline gas to the riser at a point above the riser base. The transfer process will reduce both the hydrostatic head in the riser and the pressure in the pipeline, consequently lessening or eliminating the severe slugging by maintaining the steady-state two-phase flow in the riser.In this paper, a steady-state model is presented. It can be used as a design tool for the self-lifting concept by determining the operation envelope for a successful self-lift operation; given the location of the gas takeoff or injection points, it can predict the acceptable range of pressure losses in the gas bypass for continuous steady-state operation of the self-gas-lift system.

For example, pile driving could damage the hearing of marine mammals while underwater explosions can also result in physical damage or death. Effective mitigation is required to reduce these risks, but the exclusion zones specified in regulations can extend over hundreds or thousands of metres and seals pose particular problems because they are difficult to detect at sea. Aversive sound mitigation aims to exclude animals from high-risk areas before dangerous activities take place by broadcasting specific acoustic signals. Field research is needed to identify signals that might be effective in eliciting short-term avoidance by marine species such as harbour seals (Phoca vitulina). A series of controlled-exposure experiments (CEEs) were undertaken to measure seal movements in response to acoustic deterrent devices (ADD) and predator calls, and to assess the effectiveness of candidate signals for aversive sound mitigation. Seals were fitted with UHF/GPS transmitters providing continuous high-resolution tracks and real-time transmissions of their locations. A tracking/playback vessel located seals at sea and transmitted either ADD signals or orca (Orcinus orca) calls over a range of distances while seals were foraging or moving between sites. Behaviour before, during and after exposure was analysed to assess responses. One-hundred and ten CEEs were assessed as being of at least 'adequate' quality. Of the 71 adequate trials with the Lofitech ADD, all 38 at ranges of <1 km (predicted received level 134.6 dB RMS re 1 mu Pa) elicited a response. The maximum response range was 3123 m (predicted RL: 111 dB RMS re 1 mu Pa). However, the responses observed did not always result in substantial movements away from the source, especially for seals that were travelling at the time of the exposures. More work is needed to better understand how exposure risks would be reduced in different scenarios. The mean net speed of horizontal movements for seals responding to aversive sounds (1.15 m s(-1)) was only 7% higher than their mean travel speed. Responses to broadcasts of orca calls were highly variable. The results suggest that signals similar to those generated by a Lofitech ADD could be used to reduce risks to harbour seals from pile driving and underwater explosions in coastal waters. More work will be needed to develop systems that match the requirements of industry and regulators and to explore whether these results can be generalized to offshore waters and to other phocids.",,,,,,,,,5,0,0,0,3,0,5,,,1052-7613,1099-0755,,,,,,,,,,"Univ St Andrews, Scottish Oceans Inst, Sea Mammal Res Unit, St Andrews, Fife, ScotlandPathtrack Ltd, Otley, W Yorkshire, England",Pathtrack Ltd,,,2019-09-30,WOS:000484997200012,,

Thereby, the risk of accidents increase. Immediate negative impacts are expected from oil spills through the acute mortality for marine organisms, especially from heavy fuel oil (HFO). Marine Diesel oil (MDO) is therefore suggested as a preferable fuel for ships operating in Arctic waters. However, Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAHs) are toxic components in both types of fuel, are highly bioavailable and can transfer up the food chain. A spill of MDO following a shipwreck could therefore have impacts beyond the spill site and long after the diesel has spread and evaporated. We model the spread of PAHs from a fictitious spill of MDO in the Pechora Sea (South Eastern Barents Sea) using the contaminant tracer module Ecotracer, in the Ecopath modelling software. We address the effects on the food-web including long term effects by combining toxicology and food web modelling. Ecotracer assumes that pollutants follow the biomass passively through the system, and degradation of pollutants is following user specified rates. By combining in natura measurements of PAHs in seawater and in blue mussels (Mytilus edulis) recorded at an accidental MDO spill site, with experiments conducted on the red king crab (Paralithodes camtschaticus) and blue mussels, we derived values as inputs into the model. The Ecotracer predicted that the pollution in the mussels will spread throughout the food-web, especially to the top predators of mussels, king eider (Somateria spectabilis) and Atlantic walrus (Odobenus rosmarus rosmarus) and also from snow crab (Chionoecetes opilio) to seals and toothed whales.

Concentrations of PAHs were measured in surface soils, marine and estuary sediments prior to and during remediation of the Sydney Tar Ponds (STPs) site which was contaminated by nearly a century of coking and steel production. Previous studies identified PAHs in surficial marine sediments within Sydney Harbour, which were considered to be derived from STP discharges. Numerous PAH fingerprint techniques (diagnostic ratios, principal component analysis, quantitative and qualitative analysis) were applied to soil and sediment samples from the STPs and surrounding area to identify common source apportionment of PAHs. Results indicate coal combustion (from historical residential, commercial and industrial uses) and coal handling (from historic on-site stockpiling and current coal transfer and shipment facilities) are likely the principal source of PAHs found in urban soils and marine sediments, consistent with current and historical activities near these sites. However, PAH fingerprints associated with STP sediments correlated poorly with those of urban soils and marine sediments, but were similar to coal tar, historically consistent with by-products produced by the former coking operations. This study suggests PAH contamination of Sydney Harbour sediments and urban soils is largely unrelated to historic coking operations or recent remediation of the STPs site, but rather a legacy of extensive use of coal for a variety of activities.

As the oil and gas exploration and production is breaking new boundaries, deploying new floating systems and moving into regions with harsher environments, it is of paramount importance to understand what level of reliability these new marine structures are achieving. This paper presents a reliability analysis of the mooring system of a Floating LNG (FLNG) vessel permanently moored and permanently manned offshore North West Australia in a tropical cyclone environment. The reliability analysis addresses both the mooring chain and the pile foundation. The analysis accounts for the long term characteristics of the environment, including the short term variability, in response to a given sea state and the variability and uncertainty in strength of the mooring chain and the pile. The stationkeeping system was analysed using detailed time domain simulations, capturing system non-linearities and low frequency oscillations as well as wave frequency responses and, thereby, reducing modelling uncertainties to a minimum.It is found that for the conditions modelled, neither the chain nor the pile meet a target reliability of 10(-4)/annum using the factors of safety commonly used in design following current ISO and API standards. New factors of safety are proposed to achieve this target reliability. For the pile design, one complicating factor is that current design standards do not explicitly define the exceedance probability that should be associated with the characteristic value of the undrained shear strength to be used in the design. It is demonstrated that the required factor of safety is crucially dependent on the definition of this characteristic value and on the level and the type of uncertainty in the soil strength profile. A recommendation is made regarding the definition of this characteristic value and the associated factor of safety.

The slugging flow can cause a lot of problems, such as those relevant to production safety, fatigue as well as capability. As one typical phenomenon in multi-phase flow dynamics, the slug can be avoided or eliminated by proper facility design or control of operational conditions. Based on a testing facility which can emulate a pipeline-riser or a gas-lifted production well in a scaled-down manner, this paper experimentally studies the correlations of key operational parameters with severe slugging flows. These correlations are reflected through an obtained stable surface in the parameter space, which is a natural extension of the bifurcation plot. The maximal production opportunity without compromising the stability is also studied. Relevant studies have already showed that the capability, performance and efficiency of anti-slug control can be dramatically improved if these stable surfaces can be experimentally determined beforehand. The paper concludes that obtaining the stable surface on the new developed map can significantly improve the production rate in a control scheme. Even though the production rate can be further improved by moving the stable surface using advanced control strategies, the constant inputs can in some cases be preferable due to the easier implementation.",,,,,,,,,6,1,0,0,0,0,7,,,1476-8186,1751-8520,,,,,,,,,,"Aalborg Univ, Dept Energy Technol, Esbjerg Campus,Niels Bohrs Vej 8, DK-6700 Esbjerg, Denmark",,,,2016-02-01,WOS:000442395100008,,

The Marine Profiling Radiometer (MPR) is designed for operation on a buoy, ship, or for land-based applications. Despite the increased utility of weather forecasts over the past decades, accuracy decreases rapidly as the scale of the weather features decreases and the time range of the forecasts increases. Forecasting the evolution and movement of smaller-scale, short-lived, often intense weather phenomena such as tornadoes, hail storms, and flash floods is less mature than prediction of larger-scale weather systems. This is caused, in part, by inadequate observations. The proposed technology will fill the missing gap in data. Phase I will develop a simplified prototype of MPR to experimentally validate new concepts of ambient calibration, as well as, a self-cleaning mechanism for protection of optical components. The novel calibration approach will enable standalone operation even under extreme weather conditions that can be encountered in harsh marine environments. The major innovation of this all-weather technology is its ability to provide otherwise un-obtainable data in a timely and cost effective manner. The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is in demonstrating a novel approach to radiometer calibration that could lead to advancement in its use and dramatic improvement in the understanding of the thermodynamic state of the atmosphere, especially in the boundary layer. As 50% of the US population lives within 50 miles of the coast, better information about offshore conditions can have significant economical impact. Improved forecasts will benefit water management of reservoirs/coastal regions, can be used by commercial/military vessels to improve safety and enhance missile guidance system accuracy. MPR data will improve coastal meteorology, improve protection mechanisms and reducing evacuation costs for severe weather events; enhance our understanding of ocean-atmosphere interaction and provide information about regional climate change; reduce the cost associated with offshore wind farm and oil platform operation while improving overall safety; facilitate optimization of the electrical grid improving energy efficiency; enhance weather/dispersion model ensembles for homeland security applications; and provide current weather information to help ensure efficient and environmentally sound sea and port operations for commercial and recreational vessels.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,944622,,,,,,,,"Boulder Environmental Sciences and Technology, LLC","Boulder Environmental Sciences and Technology, LLC",,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:13548589,,

Moreover, the annual maintenance dredging for the main channel accelerated alteration. In order to understand the sedimentation characteristics, archived intensive depth measurements were used to assess the variations in the bottom shear stress. Our results showed that the bottom shear stress and tidal prism have lessened. The resulting sedimentation should be managed through dredging or minimization plans based on an appropriate engineering solution. In this paper, we suggest an optimized weighting factor to represent diverse physical morphological variations that affect the shear stress.

In particular, a tighter formulation for the production sharing agreements based on our recent work, and a perfect positive or negative correlation among the endogenous uncertain parameters (field size, oil deliverability, water-oil ratio and gas-oil ratio) is considered to reduce the total number of scenarios in the resulting multistage stochastic formulation.

The study was conducted to aid MMS in reducing risks associated with oil and gas operations on the continental shelf along the Texas and Louisiana coasts from the mouth of the Mississippi River to the Rio Grande.Begun in September 1991, it was the largest physical oceanography program ever undertaken in the Gulf. The program consists of three major parts: LATEX A, B, and C, conducted by the Texas A&M University System (TAMUS), Louisiana State University (LSU), and Science Applications International Corp.

Cruise information, position, date and time were reported for each observation. The data record was comprised of pairs of temperature-depth values. Unlike the MBT Data File, in which temperature values were recorded at uniform 5 m intervals, the XBT data files contained temperature values at non-uniform depths. These depths were recorded at the minimum number of points (inflection points) required to accurately define the temperature curve. Standard XBTs can obtain profiles to depths of either 450 or 760 m. With special instruments, measurements can be obtained to 1830 m. Prior to July 1994, XBT data were routinely processed to one of these standard types.

Circular deck is connected to buoyant legs using hinged joints, which restrain transfer of rotation from the legs to deck and vice-versa. Buoyant legs are connected to seabed using taut-moored system with high initial pretension, enabling rigid body motion in vertical plane. Encountered environmental loads induce dynamic tether tension variations, which in turn affect stability of the platform. Postulated failure cases, created by placing eccentric loads at different locations resulted in dynamic tether tension variation; chaotic nature of tension variation is also observed in few cases. A detailed numerical analysis is carried out for BLSRP using Mathieu equation of stability. Increase in the magnitude of eccentric load and its position influences fatigue life of tethers significantly. Fatigue life decreases with the increase in the amplitude of tension variation in tethers.

We have changed the atmosphere of our planet. In many regions soil erosion, soil quality, is catastrophic and with this, food security. Water quantity, quality, is a major problem in almost half the nations. Our energy systems dominated by use of oil, gas, coal are not sustainable and in many regions, the management of toxic wastes is disastrous. Our basic resources are derived from the Sun, the atmosphere, biosphere, hydrosphere and the outer 5-km of the solid Earth. We require a new effort to integrate knowledge to develop the needed technologies for the future 10 billion humans who will live with our planet. Earth sciences, Earth history, are at the foundation of such efforts.Observations on ocean floor processes show vast opportunities for the supply of energy and materials with minimal environmental perturbation. Today, the continental land surface is too valuable for many of these purposes. If one examines processes near the great ocean ridges at ocean hotspots, there is a vast potential for collecting almost all metals, ceramics, and of particular urgency, energy.Observations on the sea floor materials produced over the past decades clearly show the vast potential for mineral resources. It is interesting that the World watch Institute in their most recent State of the World, 2003 have a special chapter Scrapping mining dependence and have also published a special report (paper 162, October 2002) on the Anatomy of Resource Wars. Their data on the misuse of land resources is alarming. Peter Rona has recently reviewed marine minerals for the 21st century (Episodes 25:2-12, 2002) and has written a brief version in Science (299:673-674, 2003). The data are impressive and include almost all elements use by humans. Data on the elements in manganese nodules is very impressive as also recently reported for India by Mukhopadhyay, Iyer and Ghosh in Earth Science Reviews 60:67-130, 2003. The geothermal fluids associated with the cooling of magmas have vast potential for metal transport. We have recently shown that high temperature fluids rich in carbon dioxide also contain carbon monoxide, CO, which is a wonderful transport agent for metals like gold, platinum, nickel and precipitate these on cooling. The guide to the processes is the presence of thin films of graphite, normally with sulphides. And in most places, there is evidence for the role played by diverse microorganisms. Recently, Karthikeyan and Beveridge have described how certain biofilms can precipitate gold (Environmental Microbiology 4:667-675, 2002). Fyfe (Science 273:448, 1996) has reviewed the wide range of environments where microorganisms are common, even to depths of over 4 km at temperatures of 100degreesC. We cannot understand near surface geochemistry without understanding the role of microorganisms.The world needs new energy technologies. The sea floor rocks have vast potential for geothermal energy. As I have shown 100 km3 of rock at 1000degreesC could provide our global energy needs. And hot geothermal fluids also contain hydrogen, the perfect mobile fuel. The literature on geothermal hydrogen is exploding but see an early review by Hawkes, Mining Engineering, June 1980, 671-675.We have also recently shown that with microorganisms, basalts can fix carbon dioxide with great efficiency. Why not put combustion gases underground (see Fyfe, Science, 1996).There is also vast potential for agricultural materials in ocean floor systems. These include: minerals with phosphorus, calcium, potassium and traces like molybdenum necessary for natural nitrogen fixation in soils. But recently there have been observations that fascinate me. The worst soils in the world in the world for food production are the mineral deficient laterites of many regions. Recent studies in Brazil on modem marine sediments from Guanabara Bay and Utuba Bay are of great interest (see Anais da Academia Brasileira. de Ciencias 73:121, 2001; 75:77, 2003). First it is of great interest that the older sediments are dominated by illite vermiculite and smectite. In addition, the trace metal content and organic content increase with long exposure to marine fluids. Such observations raise a great question: Does rather short exposure to seawater delaterize soils and could such sediments be used as fertilizer materials in many old lateritic soils? Mineral fertilizers can be of long life, low pollution and can be economic.Another urgent topic in our world is the management of many types of wastes. Recently, we have shown that if arsenic-polluted water is filtered through powders of FeS (pyrrhotite) the arsenic is removed to acceptable levels. But where do you put the wastes?And another urgent question is, where is the best place on the planet to deposit nuclear wastes? The Japanese have considered ocean trenches and the British, ocean muds where the wastes can be higly dispersed. Near shore sites with high sedimentation rates could be of interest. Marine experts must consider such problems (see Fyfe, Engineering Geology 52:159-161, 1999).Finally, I have a dream! When we consider situations like the Juan de Fuca ridge off the Pacific west coast, where sediments rapidly cover and insulate the very warm ridge basalts thermal gradients are very high. Could we produce an ocean resource ship, which could drill, produce geothermal energy, geothermal hydrogen, metals and return the processed fluids underground with zero pollution? Such technologies have been developed in the geothermal regions of New Zealand. Given the mass of west coast ridge hot rocks, the energy involved could supply the needs of the west coast of North America.As in many such examples the need is for clear, accurate, demonstration that it could work! And the economic analysis must be for decades, future generations, not just till the next election!

Motivated by concerns surrounding these finds, we conducted an intensive sampling campaign of Apostle Islands waters in 2017 to understand Dreissena prevalence and distribution. The 100-site effort combined random and targeted sites and collected zooplankton, benthos, video, environmental DNA, and supporting water quality data. We did not find settled Dreissena in any video footage or benthos samples, and quantitative PCR applied to eDNA samples was negative for Dreissena. Dreissena veligers were found in almost half the zooplankton samples but at orders of magnitude lower densities than reported from other Laurentian Great Lakes. Veligers were most prevalent around the western islands and associated with shallower depths and slightly higher phosphorus and chlorophyll, but did not spatially match known (still very localized) settled Dreissena colonies. This is the first study to conduct veliger-targeted sampling in western Lake Superior and the first to report consistent detection of veligers there. We speculate that these Apostle Islands veligers are not a new locally-spawned component of the zooplankton community, but instead are transported from an established population in the St. Louis River estuary (similar to 100 km away) by longshore currents; i.e., low-density propagule pressure that may have been present for years. Small-mesh zooplankton data collected along a gradient from the Apostle Islands to the St Louis River estuary and enumerated with thorough veliger searching would help elucidate these alternatives.

Therefore, it is necessary to formulate law and policy to reduce greenhouse gas emissions ahead of Korea, and to study and refer to legislation from advanced countries including the UK, which enacted and amended laws, from a comparative legal point of view.UK has long pursued CCS as a policy to reduce greenhouse gases for climate change issues in the course of continuous using coal as an energy source. To support this policy, UK establishes the grounds for CO2 capture and storage and carries out policies and projects not by the enactment of a single law but by the method of the revision of the individual laws.The Energy Law established the emission standard (1 lb CO2/kWh) among the laws for promoting CCS. The Energy Law has contained the introduction of CCS technology to new coal-fired power plants, the three-year emission restriction, and subvention to encourage low-carbon power generation.Through the amendment of the Electricity Law, all new combustion plants of 300 MW above are institutionalizing the regulation of Capture Ready.“Health and Safety Law at Work etc.” will be applied to the land and marine CCS processes from April 2013. The general obligation in this Law is that CCS operators should take a proportional approach to all CCS risk management. This should be demonstrated through a comprehensive risk assessment that takes into account the range of hazards that occur in the design, commissioning, operation (including maintenance and inspection) of the CO2 pipeline and in the closed circuit.Therefore, We have gained successfully implications for CCS in Korea through the UK policies on climate change policy, carbon capture and storage, and the well-established UK laws.",,,,"우리 헌법 제35조는 환경권과 환경보호의무를 규정하고 있지만, 기후변화협약에 관한 국제조약을 이행하여야 할 의무에 관한 규정을 두고 있지 않다. 그렇지만 파리기후협약 등 국제조약이 헌법 제6조에 의하여 국내법과 동일한 효력을 가지게 되고, 이산화탄소 포집 및 저장(CCS : Carbon dioxide Capture & Storage) 등과 같은 다양한 수단을 통해 온실가스를 감축하도록 하고 있다. 그래서 우리나라보다 앞서서 온실가스를 감축하기 위한 정책을 입안하고 법률을 제정Â·개정한 영국을 비롯한 선진국들의 입법을 비교법적 관점에서 연구하고 참고하는 것이 필요하다.특히 영국은 기후변화의 문제를 해결하고 석탄을 계속 에너지원으로 사용하기 위해 오래전부터 온실가스를 줄이기 위한 정책으로 CCS를 추진하였다. 이런 정책을 뒷받침하기 위해 단일법의 제정이 아닌 개별법의 개정을 통해 CCS에 관한 근거를 마련하고 정책과 사업을 진행하고 있다.CCS를 추진하기 위한 법률 중 「에너지법」에서는 신규 석탄화력발전소에 CCS 기술도입 의무화, 3년간 배출제한 유예, 보조금 지급을 통한 저탄소 전력발전의 유인책을 강구하였다. 그리고 「전기법」의 개정을 통해 300MW 이상의 모든 신규 연소 발전소는 CO2 포집대비(Capture Ready) 규정을 제도화하고 있다. 「작업등에서 건강과 안전법(Health & Safety at Work etc. Act)」은 2013년 4월부터 육상 및 해상 CCS 프로세스에 적용된다. 이 법에서 일반의무는 CCS 운영자가 모든 CCS 위험 관리에 비례적 접근을 취해야 한다. 이는 CO2 파이프라인의 설계, 시운전, 운전(유지 보수 및 검사 포함) 및 폐로에서 발생하는 위험 범위를 고려한 포괄적인 위험 평가를 통해 입증되어야 한다. 결국, 영국에서 추진해 왔던 기후변화정책과 이산화탄소 포집 및 저장 등에 관한 정책과 잘 정비된 법률의 검토를 통해 한국에서 추진하고 있는 CCS에 대한 시사점을 얻게 되었다. 한국도 영국 등의 선진적인 입법례를 참고로 하여 CCS를 통한 이산화탄소감축을 위한 구체적인 입법을 지속적으로 해 나가야 하며, 장기적으로는 헌법개정을 통하여 기후변화노력 등에 대한 규정을 두는 것이 필요하다.",,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,1976-4383,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2018-01-01,KJD:ART002431225,,

The power on offshore installations is generated by gas turbines operating in a simple cycle. There is an obvious possibility for heat recovery for further power generation from the exhaust heat. However, the limited space and weight available makes the inclusion of bottoming cycles challenging. Due to its high working pressure and thereby compact components CO2 (carbon dioxide) could be a viable solution, combining compactness and efficiency. An in-house simulation tool is used to evaluate the performance of CO2 bottoming cycles at design and off-design conditions. Both a simple recuperated single stage cycle and a more advanced dual stage system are modelled. Results from simulations show a potential for 10 -11%-points increase in net plant efficiency at 100% gas turbine load. Also off-design simulations taking the variation in heat exchanger performance into account are performed showing that the bottoming cycle improves the off-design performance compared to the standard gas turbine solution. Even at 60% GT (gas turbine) load, the combined cycle with CO2 bottoming cycle can achieve up to 45% net plant efficiency, compared to 31% for only the gas turbine. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

First, to save communication resources, an event-triggered data packet processor (DPP) is proposed such that the transmissions of the sensor data can be regulated over the communication channel. Second, by virtue of the time-delay system approach, a unified closed-loop system model is presented which can well accommodate the simultaneous presence of network-induced delays, nonlinearity and uncertainty in the offshore structure. To further increase resilience, the control law is allowed to possess gain perturbations. Then, via the Lyapunov functional method, criteria for designing a resilient event-based synthesis strategy are derived. Finally, an illustrative example is given to verify that the developed resilient strategy can guarantee the prescribed performance of the offshore structure while alleviating the frequent occupancy of the scarce communication resources.

Salvage operation of the vessel started immediately after the wreck. This operation was the largest and most expensive maritime salvage ever attempted on a wrecked ship and it ended in July 2014 when the Costa Concordia was removed from the Giglio Island, and dragged in the port of Genoa where it was dismantled. The refloating and removal phases of the Costa Concordia were monitored, in the period between 14th and 27th of July, exploiting SAR (Synthetic Aperture Radar) images acquired by the X-band COSMO-SkyMed satellite constellation in crisis mode. The main targets of the monitoring system were: (i) the detection of possible spill of pollutant material from the vessel and (ii) to exclude that oil slicks, illegally produced by other vessels, could be improperly linked to the naval convoy during its transit along the route between the Giglio Island and the port of Genoa. Results point out that the adopted monitoring system, through the use of the COSMO-SkyMed constellation, can be profitably employed to monitor emergency phases related to single ship or naval convoy over wide areas and with a suitable temporal coverage. Furthermore, the refloating and removal phases of the Costa Concordia were a success because no pollution was produced during the operations. (C) 2015 The Authors.

The analysis was carried out under multiple scenarios of meteorological conditions. Oil evaporation, oil weathering, and shore stranding are also considered. Seasonal hazard maps for different stranding times and seasonal risk maps were then produced for the whole Sicilian coastline. The results highlight that depending on the meteo-marine conditions, particles can reach different areas of the Sicily coast, including its northern side, and illustrate how impacts can be greatly reduced through prompt implementation of mitigation strategies.

Its floor is covered with the deposits of the deepest underwater fan of the World Ocean. Three sedimentary basins-Bengal proper, Krishna-Godawari, and Koromandel-are distinguished around the Bay of Bengal; all of them extend to the aquatic area of the bay. Estimations of oil and gas generation under the floor of the Bay of Bengal suggest that this process is most intensive in the northern part of the bay, where the thickness of the sediments exceeds 11 km. There, the maximum densities of oil and gas generation reach approximately 2-7 x 10(6) t/kM(2) and 3-11 X 10(6) m(3)/km(2). In the southern half of the basin, these values are 20 times smaller for oil and 110 times smaller for gas. These kinds of foci of oil and gas generation are regarded as large, which is confirmed by the discoveries of giant fields in the last two ears in the Krishna-Godawari basin (with oil reserves of more than 400 Mt and those of gas of 340-425 Gm(3)) and in the Nicobar alluvial fan. The section interval corresponding to the focus of oil and gas generation contains sediments from the Upper Miocene to the Lower Cretaceous. The alteration of reservoirs (sands) and caprocks (clays), together with the enrichment of the latter in organic matter, determined the high potential of the deltaic, avant-deltaic, and turbidite sediments. The reserve of hydrocarbons in the turbidites is estimated at more than 1.2 Gt.",,,,,,,,,2,0,0,0,0,0,2,,,0001-4370,,,,,,,,,,,"Russian Acad Sci, PP Shirshov Oceanol Inst, Moscow, Russia",,,,2004-09-01,WOS:000224889600013,,

The EC CCS guidance document addresses the issues with statements on competitions between subsurface operations but returns no absolute values.Pressure modelling of CO2 injection process with state of the art reservoir simulation tools is challenges by use of realistic model boundary conditions in order to model a realistic pressure level. Combined use of models on a site scale and on a regional scale can instruct how boundary conditions are set-up for a site scale model.Pressure management through pressure release wells could be an option to mitigate undesirable over-pressure developments. For local structural closures the pressure release wells can be placed outside the closure hereby mitigate the overpressure without introducing a potential leakage by drilling inside the trap.The paper addresses the issue of selecting model boundary conditions and modelling mitigation of pressure development by use of a large regional model with local structural traps in the Bunter Sandstone Formation in the UK Southern North Sea.

The aim is to take the perspective of decision-makers and ask in what way safety climate surveys can provide managers with warning signals related to organizational conditions for safety. Using data material from the Norwegian offshore oil and gas operations, we have tested whether three major close call incidents could be detected through using safety climate data from the period before the incidents. We examined the problem through testing (1) if the installations in question deviated from the industry average, and (2) if the trends for the installations could reveal that something was wrong. The results are inconclusive; only one of the installations deviates negatively from the industry average one year before the incident, and the trend variations are so small that it is questionable if they would have triggered actions from the management. The challenges when relying on safety climate as a means of managing risk of major accidents on individual installations are discussed. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

A key challenge to advancing an economically competitive U.S. MHK industry is reducing the time and cost required for environmental permitting and compliance with government regulations. Other industries such as offshore oil and gas, offshore wind energy, subsea power and data cables, onshore wind energy, and solar energy facilities have all developed more robust permitting and compliance pathways that provide lessons for the MHK industry in the U.S. and may help inform the global consenting process.

Species Sensitivity Distributions (SSD) for Total Hydrocarbon Concentrations (THCs) were developed, and Hazard Concentrations (HC) used as levels of concern. Potential consequences to entrained water column organisms were characterized by comparing model outputs with SSDs, and obtaining the proportion of species affected (PSA) and areas with oil concentrations exceeding HC5s (Area(>= HC5)). Under the physically-dispersed oil scenario <= 77% of the oil remains on the water surface and strands on shorelines, while with the chemically-dispersed oil scenario <= 67% of the oil is entrained in the water column. For every 10% increase in chemical dispersion effectiveness, the average PSA and Area(>= HC5) increases (range: 0.01-0.06 and 0.50-2.9 km(2), respectively), while shoreline oiling decreases (<= 2919 L/km).

Introduction of a compressed air breathing apparatus for the offshore oil and gas industry. Aviat Space Environ Med 2010; 81:683-7. Introduction: When a helicopter ditches the majority of crew and passengers have to make an underwater escape. Some may not be able to hold their breath and will drown. For at least 15 yr, military aircrew have been trained to use a scuba system. In the offshore oil and gas industry, there has been more caution about introducing a compressed air system and a rebreather system has been introduced as an alternative. Recently, Canadian industry and authorities approved the introduction of Helicopter Underwater Emergency Breathing Apparatus (HUFBA) training using compressed air. This communication reports the training of the first 1000 personnel. Methods: Training was introduced in both Nova Scotia and Newfoundland concurrently by the same group of instructors. Trainees filled out a questionnaire concerning their perceived ratings of the ease or difficulty of classroom training and the practical use of the HUEBA. Results: Ninety-eight percent of trainees found the classroom and in-water training to be good/very good. Trainees found it to be easy/very easy to clear the HUEBA and breathe underwater in 84% and 64% of cases, respectively. Divers reported a greater ease in learning all the practical uses of the HUEBA except application of the nose clip. Discussion: There were problems with the nose clip fitting incorrectly, and interference of the survival suit hood with the regulator, which subsequently have been resolved. When carefully applied, the introduction of the HUEBA into training for offshore oil and gas industry helicopter crew and passengers can be safely conducted.",,,,,,,,,4,0,0,0,3,0,4,,,0095-6562,1943-4448,,,,,,,,,,"Survival Syst Training Ltd, Dartmouth, NS, Canada",Survival Syst Training Ltd,,,2010-07-01,WOS:000279187200010,20597249,

It is a critical region among the disputing countries because of its geographic position in major oceanic routes used by crude oil tankers from the Persian Gulf to Asia and for transporting goods to the rest of the world. It is important, as well, for its promising offshore oil and gas reserves, other undersea resources, and rich marine life. This dissertation addresses three questions: First, what factors increase the probability of conflicts in the South China Sea region? Second, what is the role of ASEAN in managing conflicts in the SCS region? And third, what is the likely utility of other conflict prevention mechanisms in the SCS region? Following a careful review of existing literature relevant to the South China Sea disputes, the study assesses the effectiveness of UNCLOS as an international legal regime in addressing them. It also discusses each of the disputing parties, their individual stakes in specific disputes, and the long history and current status of the disputes. Special attention is paid to the involvement of China as well as external powers like the United States and India. The dissertation additionally weighs ASEANs role in the development and functioning of Asia-Pacific multilateralism, and its limited capacity to create a sense of regional community and address SCS disputes effectively. ASEANs main role has been one of reiterating the norm of peaceful resolution of conflicts and engaging the parties in successive conferences, workshops, and supposed confidence-building measures. Although this study does suggest a few more such measures that might help to moderate tensions, it ends on a pessimistic note about the prospect of future armed conflicts in the South China Sea.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2018-05-17,DRCI:DATA2018087012891717,,

We used the random forests modeling approach to map the distribution of predicted stopover habitat for the Whooping Crane (Grus americana), an endangered species whose migratory flyway overlaps with an area where wind energy development is expected to become increasingly important. We then used this information to identify areas for potential wind power development in a U.S. state within the flyway (Nebraska) that minimize conflicts between Whooping Crane stopover habitat and the development of clean, renewable energy sources. Up to 54% of our study area was predicted to be unsuitable as Whooping Crane stopover habitat and could be considered relatively low risk for conflicts between Whooping Cranes and wind energy development. We suggest that this type of analysis be incorporated into the habitat conservation planning process in areas where incidental take permits are being considered for Whooping Cranes or other species of concern.

Plays include post-breakup pinch-outs and 4-way dip closures. A sequence stratigraphic analysis incorporating seismic interpretation, well log analysis and new biostratigraphic data characterised the reservoir-seal pair. Palaeogeographic mapping reveals multiple regressive transgressive cycles which infilled the central palaeodepression on the Valanginian Unconformity. Within the deltaic South Perth Supersequence, the Gage Lowstand Fan (lithostratigraphically referred to as the Gage Sandstone) is a sand-rich submarine fan system and ranges from canyon-confined inner fan to basin plain middle fan deposits. Major sediment contributions were from north south-trending canyons adjacent to the Mandurah Terrace. Detailed seismic fades mapping and well log analysis of the Gage Lowstand Fan show that distal middle fan sand sheets and stacked channelised sands in the inner fan may provide an extensive reservoir of good to excellent quality. Seal quality varies greatly and may explain the lack of exploration success at some structural closures. A re-evaluation of the regional seal determined the extent of deepwater shale facies that provides an effective seal for the underlying submarine fans. 3D geological modelling confirms that the reservoir is suitable for hydrocarbon entrapment and CO2 storage. Migration path analysis identified the presence of multiple structural and stratigraphic closures at the top of the reservoir. Previous petroleum systems modelling concluded that some source rock maturation probably post-dates deposition of the effective seal thereby allowing structural closures to be charged with hydrocarbons. Uncertainties potentially comprising hydrocarbon preservation and CO2 storage include reactivation of large syn-rift faults that may breach top seal, the potential absence of base seal, effective seal thickness, and reservoir thickness and quality.

Conducting evacuation planning on OOGPs is challenging. Computational tools are considered as a good way to plan evacuation by emergency simulation. However, the complex structure of OOGPs and various evacuation behaviors can weaken the advantages of computational simulation. Therefore, this study develops a simulation model for OOGPs to evaluate different evacuation plans to improve evacuation performance by integrating building information modeling (BIM) technology and agent-based model (ABM). The developed model consists of four parts: evacuation model input, simulation environment modeling, agent definition, and simulation and comparison. Necessary platform information is extracted from BIM and then used to model the simulation environment by integrating matrix model and network model. In addition to essential attributes, environment sensing and dynamic escape path planning functions are developed and assigned to agents in order to improve simulation performance. Total evacuation time for all agents on an offshore platform is used to evaluate the evacuation performance of each simulation. An example OOGP BIM topsides with different emergency scenarios is used to illustrate the developed evacuation evaluation model. The results show that the developed model can accurately simulate evacuation and improve evacuation performance on OOGPs.

Previous studies are mainly conducted to hydrodynamic analysis and dynamic response calculation, but there are few studies on the fatigue damage analysis of hybrid mooring line. Take the mooring system of a Spar platform as the research object, and the multicomponent mooring lines are usually made up of chain-wire-chain. The representative mooring line has been considered while other conditions are kept unchanged, and top end tension-static offset characteristic curve of the two mooring lines are consistent as much as possible, meanwhile the polyester rope is adopted as the substitute for the wire, then the comparative calculation on fatigue damage of deepwater hybrid mooring line is carried on.The analysis of Spar platform response is carried out in which the wave force is calculated under diffraction theory. After the establishment of two-dimensional nonlinear finite element dynamic model of the hybrid mooring line, the calculation on stiffness of the hybrid mooring line is accomplished through the iterative method based on the empirical formula proposed by Del Vecchio in 1992. The mooring line and seabed interaction is based on the hypothesis of rigid seabed. The fluid drag force and inertia force on the mooring line are calculated according to the Morrison formula. The dynamic analysis is executed through time-domain nonlinear finite element method accounting for the response of the Spar platform which is calculated as above. The stress time histories of the hybrid mooring line in each short-term sea state of South China Sea area are calculated, and then the rain flow counting method is employed to obtain the fatigue load spectrum in each short-term sea state. The Miner linear cumulative law model is used to compare the fatigue damage of the hybrid mooring lines in long-term sea state which consists of tens of short-term sea states.The results show that the using of polyester rope as the substitute for the wire can significantly improve the fatigue resistance.",,,,,"29th ASME International Conference on Ocean, Offshore and Arctic Engineering29th ASME International Conference on Ocean, Offshore and Arctic Engineering","JUN 06-11, 2010JUN 06-11, 2010","ASME, Ocean, Offshore & Arctic Engn DivASME, Ocean, Offshore & Arctic Engn Div","Shanghai, PEOPLES R CHINAShanghai, PEOPLES R CHINA",2,0,0,0,0,0,2,,,,,978-0-7918-4909-5,,,,,,,,,"Harbin Inst Technol, Sch Civil Engn, Harbin 150006, Heilongjiang, Peoples R China",,,,2010-01-01,WOS:000290548800049,,

Flip-flops, energy drink bottles, and compact fluorescent lights (CFLs) were notable item types. The density of debris (0.74 m(-1) shore length) is comparable to similar islands but less than mainland sites. Intact CFLs suggests product-facilitated long-range transport of mercury. We suspect that aggregated marine debris, scavenged by the islands from currents and gyres, could re-concentrate pollutants. SBR islets accumulated debris types in different proportions suggesting that many factors act variably on different debris types.

We used satellite telemetry and a switching state-space model to identify distinct foraging areas used by 59 NGoM loggerheads tagged during 2010-2013. We tagged turtles after nesting at three sites, 1 in Alabama (Gulf Shores; n = 37) and 2 in Florida (St. Joseph Peninsula; n = 20 and Eglin Air Force Base; n = 2). Peak migration time was 22 July to 9 August during which >40% of turtles were in migration mode; the mean post-nesting migration period was 23.0 d (+/- 13.8 d SD). After displacement from nesting beaches, 44 turtles traveled to foraging sites where they remained resident throughout tracking durations. Selected foraging locations were variable distances from tagging sites, and in 5 geographic regions; no turtles selected foraging sites outside the Gulf of Mexico (GoM). Foraging sites delineated using 50% kernel density estimation were located a mean distance of 47.6 km from land and in water with mean depth of -32.5 m; other foraging sites, delineated using minimum convex polygons, were located a mean distance of 43.0 km from land and in water with a mean depth of -24.9 m. Foraging sites overlapped with known trawling activities, oil and gas extraction activities, and the footprint of surface oiling during the 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil spill (n = 10).

The main negative factors are the large-scale poaching, resulting in a catastrophic reduction in stocks of sturgeon and other valuable fish species of the Caspian Sea, a natural penetration of alien organisms (Mnemiopsis) and overfishing of some species. The potential danger is large-scale development of oil and gas fields in the Caspian Sea, which can lead to even worse situation for the biological resources of the sea. Conclusions.

Scientific and offshore networks often have specialized requirements beyond those that they share with traditional undersea telecom systems; these specialized features require tailored products and services to meet network needs. High-bandwidth fiber optic communication via powered, undersea telecommunication systems enables the interconnection of many scientific and offshore facilities in a multi-layered, co-use or shared, network.Through the use of traditional undersea telecommunication elements such as Cable, Erbium Doped Fiber Amplifiers (EDFA), Branching Units, and land-based Transmission & Power Feed Equipment (PFE), the undersea telecom industry can establish a backbone infrastructure that can serve as the foundation for scientific and offshore networks. Expanding beyond the aforementioned elements, wet-mate connection manifolds permit the organization of different types of subsea sensors, and communications with entire groups of natural resource exploration and production facilities. Further, wet-mate connection manifolds may be connected to, or be part of, subsea nodes. Subsea nodes provide significant advantages for the connection of sensing equipment and surface buoys which can be readily integrated with subsea communication infrastructure.The undersea telecom industry has also developed families of products which enable connection of deep water floating oil and gas production facilities or buoys. Utilizing specialized components designed for a dynamic marine environment, this connection hardware has demonstrated that the high number of fatigue cycles expected in such an environment can be accommodated when properly designed and deployed.While many of the workings of a communication network can be very detailed and complex, supporting dozens of offshore facilities or sensors, the industry has also developed product families to connect systems which do not have such vast requirements. More economical products are employed when communication distances are shorter, such that EDFAs and PFEs are not required. Utilizing similar concepts as their larger, powered cousins, non-powered systems use smaller cables and connectors to deliver equally high-capacity and robust communications networks. Both classes of telecommunication systems can also facilitate the inclusion of sub-systems utilizing long-reach wireless technologies such as microwave, WiMAX, etc.Possessing the appropriate technology to design and connect a reliable communications network is an important factor when considering subsea network architectures. Of similar importance is the ability to properly install and commission these types of networks. As with its specialized product lines, the undersea telecom industry has tailored installation methods along with purpose-designed ships to successfully deploy, commission, maintain, and repair all of the components required to create a successful subsea network.This paper is intended to provide an overview of the products and capabilities that the undersea telecommunications industry has to offer.

They are an integral part of the Critical Zone that regulates the conditions at the Earths surface and helps sustain life. Coastal marshes provide crucial services such as carbon storage and removal of nutrients and contaminants that would otherwise make their way to the ocean. Rising sea level is expanding these environments, but salt-water is also moving in, destroying woodlands, and damaging farm fields. Ghost forests and salt-damaged farm fields are stark indicators of these ecological changes along world coastlines that can adversely affect land use and economies. Less apparent, and perhaps even more important, are the concurrent changes in water and chemical cycling that are altering the functioning of the coastal Critical Zone. This research project will quantify the processes that occur in the changing coastal Critical Zone and associated alterations in cycling, fluxes, and storage of elements at the land-sea margin.

Experimental tests were performed at large laboratory scale in a large seawater column (CEO) to investigate the mass transfer process for n-butanol release. This column is fitted with glass windows in order to visualize the chemical behaviour in the water column. Experiments were performed with n-butanol at low mass flow rate to perform a droplet flow and to evaluate the solubilization processes at the droplet scale. The mass transfer occurs in the boundary layer which develops on the droplet surface. This solubilization layer detaches from the droplet and generates a persistent cloud of solubilization in the droplet wake. The results on the variation of droplet diameter along the CEO show a decrease of a factor 1.64 which corresponds to a volume loss close to 80 %. Physics of the two phase flow is presented and highlights the solubilization processes in the wake of the droplets with trailing edges vortices. The comparison of measurements with Clift's correlation (Cliff, 2005) for droplet rising velocity shows a good agreement for data obtained at the top of CEO but large discrepancies occur at the bottom.

It requires extremely low concentrations of dissolved oxygen for the corrosion of metals to begin, and removing the dissolved oxygen is currently done in large vacuum deaeration towers, a highly energy demanding process, along with additional injection of chemical oxygen scavengers. In many instances these processes are controlled in a feed-forward manner, where the operators rely on infrequent sampling and corresponding measurements to control the process. The possibilities for optimisation in this field are thus numerous. The main challenges are online measurements of dissolved oxygen and their use in feedback control. This article gives a brief review of the state-of-the-art and investigates the potential of using dissolved oxygen as a reliable feedback parameter, taking inspiration from onshore waste water industries which have been dealing with dissolved oxygen feedback control since the 1970's.

Because no active offshore oil and gas drilling was occurring at the time, and there was no record of diesel spills or evidence from previous samplings of discharges of diesel fuel-contaminated drilling muds, petroleum hydrocarbons in the suspended sediments likely were related to a source other than platform discharges. The timing as well as the hydrocarbon composition suggested the presence of a petroleum product (diluent) that was released from an oil field at Guadalupe, approximately 50 km north of Santa Maria Basin. To evaluate diluent contributions, the hydrocarbon composition of suspended sediments was characterized and compared to those of possible source materials, including diluent, formation oils, and well cuttings, using principal component analysis (PCA). Suites of saturated and aromatic hydrocarbons, enriched in the C13 to C20 range, contained in some suspended sediments were consistent with relative abundances of low to medium molecular weight components in diluent but were different from those in formation and seep oils. Results of the PCA support the compositional similarities between the diluent and affected suspended sediments. This suggests that a petroleum product was transported as an oil-particle mixture over long distances with relatively minimal degradation. Wide dispersion of diluent increased potential exposures of marine organisms to toxic lower molecular weight PAHs.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,,0,0,0,,,0730-7268,,,,,,,,,,,"Science Applications International Corp., 10260 Campus Point Drive, San Diego, CA 92121, USA",,,,1998-09-01,BCI:BCI199800439760,,

Mixed tides with a spring tidal range of about 3.6m and a large freshwater discharge produce bottom shear stresses capable of transporting nearly all the sizes of sediment present in the estuary. As a result, the morphology of the estuary is closely related to the fluxes of tidal and fluvial energy. To investigate the relationship between energetics and sedimentary processes, an energy budget based on a one-dimensional harmonic tidal model was developed for the estuary-tidal river system and has been compared with the results of geological studies of the bedforms, large-scale morphology, sediment distribution, and suspended sediment field. The pattern of energy fluxes predicted by the model suggests the division of the system into three regimes: a tidally dominated lower estuary, a mid-estuary energy flux divergence (EFD) minimum region, and a fluvially controlled, tidal-fluvial reach. Model results also show that non-linear interactions between the tidal and fluvial flows are responsible for the suppression of the tides in the tidal-fluvial reach during periods of high flow. Finally, changes in tidal amplitude at the mouth result in a less than proportionate response in tidal elevations at points inside the estuary, because the cubic dependence of dissipation on tidal amplitude damps system responses to such changes.Many features of the observed sediment transport patterns and sedimentary environments can be related to the energy budget. Most of the medium to coarse sands entering the system from the river are permanently retained within the EFD minimum. Much of this deposition takes place upstream of the limits of salinity intrusion and is not, therefore, related to baroclinic circulatory effects. Most of the fine sands and the silts and clays entering the system are not permanently retained. Some of the silts and clays are, however, temporarily retained in a turbidity maximum, whose mean position is near the lower end of the EFD minimum. This position is dictated by the inability of salinity intrusion to extend up the fluvial potential energy gradient. Although some aspects of sedimentary processes cannot readily be related to the energy budget, our model provides a valuable conceptual approach to the dominant long-term sedimentary processes of sand transport and deposition in the Columbia River Estuary that structure the observed sedimentary environments. Biological processes are in turn strongly influenced by these geological patterns.",,,,,,,,,45,0,0,0,13,0,48,,,0079-6611,,,,,,,,,,,"UNIV WASHINGTON,SCH OCEANOG,SEATTLE,WA 98195BATTELLE MEM INST,PACIFIC MARINE SCI LABS,SEQUIM,WA 98382",,,,1990-01-01,WOS:A1990EU44500005,,

There is now increasing demand for allocations to improve ecosystem productivity and respiration, and enhance carbon sequestration. Despite global recognition of wetlands as carbon sinks, information regarding carbon dynamics is lacking. This is the first study estimating carbon sequestration for semiarid Phragmites australis reedbeds. The study combined aboveground biomass assessments with stable isotope analyses of soils and modeling of biomass using Normalized Digital Vegetation Index (NDVI) to investigate the capacity of environmental water allocations to improve carbon storage. The study considered relationships between soil organic carbon (SOC), carbon sources, and reedbed persistence in the Macquarie Marshes, a regulated semiarid floodplain of the Murray-Darling Basin, Australia. SOC storage levels to 1 m soil depth were higher in persistent reedbeds (167 Mg ha(-1)) than ephemeral reedbeds (116-138 Mg ha(-1)). In situ P. australis was the predominant source of surface SOC at persistent reedbeds; mixed sources of surface SOC were proposed for ephemeral reedbeds. C-13 enrichment with increasing soil depth occurred in persistent and ephemeral reedbeds and may not relate to flow characteristics. Despite high SOC at persistent reedbeds, differences in the rate of accretion contributed to significantly higher rates of carbon sequestration at ephemeral reedbeds (approximately 554 and 465 g m(-2) yr(-1)) compared to persistent reedbeds (5.17 g m(-2) yr(-1)). However, under current water regimes, rapid accretion at ephemeral reedbeds cannot be maintained.

In this study, the fate of petroleum hydrocarbons in soft pristine sediment of Caleta Valdes (Argentina) subject to ex situ simulated oil pollution was assessed. Sedimentary columns were exposed to medium and high concentrations of Escalante Crude Oil (ECO) and incubated in the laboratory during 30 days. Levels of aliphatic hydrocarbons at different depths of the sedimentary column were determined by gas chromatography. Oil penetration was limited to the first three centimetres in both treatments, and under this depth, hydrocarbons were clearly biogenic (terrestrial plants) as in the whole sedimentary column of the control assay. Bioturbation by macrobenthic infauna was strongly impacted by oil pollution which resulted in reduced sediment oxygenation and low burial of petroleum hydrocarbons. This may partly explain the limited hydrocarbon biodegradation observed, as indicated by the relatively high values of the ratios nC17/pristane, nC18/phytane, and total resolved aliphatic hydrocarbons/ unresolved complex mixture. Correspondingly, at the end of the experiment the most probable number of hydrocarbon-degrading bacteria reached similar to 10(3 )MPN g(-1)dry weight. These values were lower than those found in chronically polluted coastal sediments, reflecting a low activity level of the oil-degrading community. The results highlight the low attenuation capacities of Caleta Valdes pristine sediments to recover its original characteristics in a short time period if an oil spill occurs.

Through this understanding and optimisation, projections can then be made for future trends in the demand for shipping, the impacts of technical and policy solutions and their associated implementation barriers, and the most just measurement and apportionment mechanisms.These unique challenges can only be addressed with strong stakeholder involvement (we have significant commitments to our consortium from regulators: WWF, Lloyds Register, technologists: British Maritime Technologies, QinetiQ and Rolls Royce and operators: Shell, Fisher, David MacBrayne and the UK MoD, as well as wider support from a number of other companies across all constituents of the shipping industry).

Using these assets we will undertake an aggregated, holistic, systems analysis of the shipping industry to elucidate and clarify the many complex interfaces in the shipping industry (port operations, owner/operator relationships, contractual agreements and the links to other transport modes). The analysis will extend to 2050, and involve the generation of future concept designs both for ships and infrastructure regimes.

With the need to reduce overall CO2 emissions by 60% by 2050 to mitigate global warming then shipping must cut its emissions. The importance of shipping to the UK economy should not be underestimated. Over 90% of the UK's imports and exports are transported by ships and UK shipping plays a vital role in transportation links to our neighbouring countries and also within the UK to its many islands. Shipping provides the means of exploiting offshore natural resources including fishing, offshore mining, and oil and gas reserves e.g. North Sea shuttle tankers, and more recently cruise ships and liners have offered holidays afloat. Today, shipping contributes some 10 billion annually to the UK's GDP thereby contributing some 3 billion to the UK Exchequer. In terms of employment, the UK shipping industry is responsible for employing over 200,000 people either directly in shipping or indirectly in service industries. Whilst few ships are actually built in the UK today, the UK remains one of the world's leading providers of marine services including insurance and finance, is home to many shipping companies, has many marine equipment manufacturers and is the centre for international shipping organisations such as IMO and the Baltic Exchange. There are currently about 750 ships over 1,000 Tonnes registered with UK classification societies, and the number of UK registered ships continues to increase despite the recent down turn in the economy in both the domestic and international markets.

A total of 76,247 oil and gas recovery wells were permitted, of which 35,163 (46%) were on land (as of 2010) and 27,483 of which are officially abandoned. There is a direct spatial and temporal relationship between the number of these permits and land loss, attributable to the above and belowground changes in hydrology resulting from the dredged material levees placed parallel to the canal (spoil banks). These hydrologic modifications cause various direct and indirect compromises to plants and soils resulting in wetland collapse. Although oil and gas recovery beneath southern Louisiana wetlands has dramatically declined since its peak in the early 1960s, it has left behind spoil banks with a total length sufficient to cross coastal Louisiana 79 times from east to west. Dragging down the remaining material in the spoil bank back into the canal is a successful restoration technique that is rarely applied in Louisiana, but could be a dramatically cost-effective and proven long-term strategy if political will prevails. The absence of a State or Federal backfilling program is a huge missed opportunity to: 1) conduct cost-effective restoration at a relatively low cost, and, 2) conduct systematic restoration monitoring and hypothesis testing that advances knowledge and improves the efficacy of future attempts. The price of backfilling all canals is about $335 million dollars, or 0.67% of the State's Master Plan for restoration and a pittance of the economic value gained from extracting the oil and gas beneath over the last 100 years.",,,,,,,,,35,0,0,0,17,0,45,,,1932-6203,,,,,,,,,,,"Louisiana State Univ, Dept Oceanog & Coastal Sci, Baton Rouge, LA 70803 USAUniv Cent Florida, Orlando, FL 32816 USA",,,,2018-12-14,WOS:000453248000008,30550603,

First track is EOS3D-Wing (Engineering Ocean Seismic 3 Dimension-Wing)) for detecting small abnormal objects buried in shallow offshore area (less than 10 m). Vertical resolution is maximized by using high-frequency range (> 5kHz) sources (e.g., Boomer, SBP, Chirp). Surveying coverage is dramatically enhanced by designing a 16 m-long wing-shaped receiver frame having 12 channels. EOS3D-Wing can be utilized for various activities performed in near-coastal area such as submarine cable monitoring, marine aggregate investigation, underwater archaeology, and coast management. In 2015, KIGAM reconstructed 3D shape of old vessel wrecked 600 years ago (in the Joseon Dynasty period) using EOS3D-Wing, and this attracted a lot of attention of international underwater archaeology communities. Second track is EOS3D-Streamer (Engineering Ocean Seismic 3 Dimension-Streamer) for visualizing geological features of shallow area. Penetration depth of elastic wave emitted by source is maximized by using middle-frequency range (< 5kHz) powerful sources (e.g., Airgun, Sparker). This system is in similar form of the conventional seismic survey system in oil and gas industry, but it has two 86m-long receiver streamers having 16 channels. EOS3D-Streamer can be utilized for detecting various geological features such as fault, unconformity, and acoustic basement. This also can be used for shallow gas exploration, geological loss study, stability analysis of various engineering works. In 2016, KIGAM succeeded in generating 3D cube of subsurface structures having many shallow faults and free gas areas in the eastern coast of Korea.

There were also carried out numerical experiments on these problems and obtained some practical significant results. Completion of the project has created a good foundation for the realization of further work in this direction. It is planned to perform the modification of the developed approach for the solution of these problems in order to develop methods for determining the location of hydrocarbon deposits and to assess their value. In particular, it is planned to implement a new model of fractured reservoirs, making it possible to obtain an adequate picture of the wave of responses from them new models of behavior of the ice formations in seismic exploration, to develop a methodology for the determination of multiple waves and other responses, that hinder analysis obtained during the seismic exploration data, as well as to solve other practically important problems. In addition, it is planned to perform the verification of the calculated data with data of physical modeling. Due to the high cost of drilling during the excavation of hydrocarbons, the optimization of the process of seismic exploration, one of the main methods of search and exploration of hydrocarbon deposits, and improving the accuracy of its methods nowadays are very actual problems for the Russian economy. Areas of the Arctic shelf and the northern latitudes of permafrost of Russia contains huge reserves of undiscovered oil and gas.

Fork length (FL), eviscerated weight, otoliths (both sagittae), and sex determinations were taken from 2,900 specimens; FL was subsequently converted to total length (TL) with the equation TL = 1.073 (FL) + 3.56. Red snapper ages (N = 2,867) estimated from counts of opaque annuli in otoliths ranged from I to 14 years; however, the vast majority (97.7%) of these were ages 2 to 6 years and the modal age was 3 years. Total lengths among 2,897 specimens ranged from 278 to 940 mm, modal TL was 400 mm, and 98% of all specimens were less than 600 mm TL. We also investigated the fate of red snapper regulatory discards (individuals <381 mm [15 in] TL) during 16 trips on working commercial vessels; over two-thirds of 4,839 red snapper assigned among four discard fate categories (ranging from alive and vigorous to dead) were returned to the water either in moribund or dead condition. Among 399 potential discards retained for age and length analyses, 86% were between 12 and 15 in (305-381 mm) TL and 85% were 2 years of age. The minimum size regulation appears to do little to protect juvenile red snapper from commercial fishing mortality. Heavy red snapper mortality, which begins as by-catch mortality in shrimp trawls, continues as discard mortality at sub-legal lengths when they first recruit to the offshore fishing grounds, and persists as harvest mortality among the youngest legal year- and size-classes. If the minimum size limit is intended to provide a respite from such mortality, a reconsideration of the utility of the minimum length regulation in the commercial harvest of red snapper may be warranted.",,,,,Symposium on Fisheries Ecology of Gulf of Mexico Red SnapperSymposium on Fisheries Ecology of Gulf of Mexico Red Snapper,"FEB 10-12, 2006FEB 10-12, 2006","Sea Grant Louisiana; NOAA; Univ West Florida; Univ S Alabama; Louisiana State Univ, Coastal Fisheries InstSea Grant Louisiana; NOAA; Univ West Florida; Univ S Alabama; Louisiana State Univ, Coastal Fisheries Inst","San Antonio, TXSan Antonio, TX",10,0,0,0,10,0,18,,,0892-2284,,978-1-888569-97-1,,,,,,,,,"Louisiana State Univ, Louisiana Sea Grant Coll Program, Sch Coast & Environm, Dept Oceanog & Coastal Sci, Baton Rouge, LA 70803 USAUniv North Carolina Wilmington, North Carolina Sea Grant Coll Program, Wilmington, NC 28409 USALouisiana State Univ, Louisiana Sea Grant Coll Program, Baton Rouge, LA 70803 USA",,,,2007-01-01,WOS:000253386500020,,

As a result, coastal wetland dynamics are strongly coupled with a wide variety of Earth's surface systems and respond to a wide range of environmental changes taking place in apparently remote and unconnected areas. In fact, coastal wetlands are sensitive to changes in a large number of forcings, including fluvial sediment delivery rates, rates of sea level rise, subsidence rates, wave climate, and, via organic sediment production by plants, to changes in nutrient concentrations, temperature, and atmospheric CO2 concentration. Furthermore, only recently have the carbon storage and the rate of carbon burial per unit area been quantified in coastal wetlands, to find that they are the highest of any biome and thus major players in the global carbon cycle. Despite their sensitivity to environmental change and their importance in the global Earth system, a predictive understanding of wetland dynamics coupled with vegetation, the tidal channel network, the tidal flats, and the permanently submerged areas is still missing. This project will impact research, education, and society. Given the ecosystem services of threatened wetlands, and the large human population near the coast that will be affected by changes in wetland area, the results of the proposed work are of clear societal importance. The results will provide simultaneous estimates of changes in coastal geomorphology, ecosystem patterns, and carbon burial rates. Students at multiple levels (undergraduate, professional master, PhD) will be impacted by the project's education/outreach plans, which include new and enhanced coursework, and field experiences. The impact of the project will be enhanced through: 1) a substantial partnership with the Museum of Life and Science (Durham, NC), to increase the awareness of environmental change, targeting K-12 and the general adult audiences including those at the coast with hands-on activities, curricular material, and a documentary; and 2) a partnership with the Venice Lagoon ferry service Alilaguna, to disseminate project background and findings to anyone interested in the Venice Lagoon and its future.<br/><br/>The intellectual merit of the project lies in developing, testing, and making available new remote sensing methods to observe coastal geomorphological and ecological patterns, from the single wetland scale to the sub-regional scale, in an improved understanding of the relative importance of different modes of environmental change for wetland survival, clarifying whether (or under what circumstances) coastal system response to changing forcing is likely to be gradual versus sudden. The project will generate and compare scenarios of coastal responses to expected environmental changes for two systemsone representative of wetland areas in the US eastern seaboard (North Inlet, SC), and one typical Mediterranean lagoon (Venice, Italy)with implications for coastal zones globally, with particular attention to changes in rates of carbon burial and the carbon cycle.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,2016068,,,,,,,,Duke University,,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:15133545,,

Observed two-point statistics confirm the accuracy of classic turbulence scaling laws at 200-m to 50-km scales and clearly indicate that dispersion at the submesoscales is local, driven predominantly by energetic submesoscale fluctuations.

On October 5, 2011, the cargo vessel C/V Rena grounded on Astrolabe Reef, New Zealand (NZ), spilling over 300 tonnes of heavy fuel oil. As part of the Rena oil spill response, 383 little blue penguins (LBP, Eudyptula minor) were captured, cleaned, rehabilitated and released back into a cleaned environment. This research investigates foraging behaviour changes due either to the oil spill or by the rehabilitation process by comparing the diving behaviour of rehabilitated (n = 8) and non-rehabilitated (n = 6) LBPs and with LBP populations throughout NZ. Stabile isotope analysis of feathers was also used to investigate diet. There were no foraging behaviour differences between rehabilitated and non-rehabilitated LBPs and the overall diving behaviour of these LBPs have similar, if not less energetic, foraging behaviour than other LBPs in NZ. This suggests the rehabilitation process and clean-up undertaken after the Rena appears effective and helps justify the rehabilitation of oiled wildlife across the world. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

J,,,,,,,,,David Gibbs,,Low Carbon Shipping - A Systems Approach,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Awarded Grant,Mar 11 2010,2010,"It is estimated that shipping accounts for 3.3% of CO2 emissions in the world. With the need to reduce overall CO2 emissions by 60% by 2050 to mitigate global warming then shipping must cut its emissions. The importance of shipping to the UK economy should not be underestimated. Over 90% of the UK's imports and exports are transported by ships and UK shipping plays a vital role in transportation links to our neighbouring countries and also within the UK to its many islands. Shipping provides the means of exploiting offshore natural resources including fishing, offshore mining, and oil and gas reserves e.g. North Sea shuttle tankers, and more recently cruise ships and liners have offered holidays afloat. Today, shipping contributes some 10 billion annually to the UK's GDP thereby contributing some 3 billion to the UK Exchequer. In terms of employment, the UK shipping industry is responsible for employing over 200,000 people either directly in shipping or indirectly in service industries. Whilst few ships are actually built in the UK today, the UK remains one of the world's leading providers of marine services including insurance and finance, is home to many shipping companies, has many marine equipment manufacturers and is the centre for international shipping organisations such as IMO and the Baltic Exchange. There are currently about 750 ships over 1,000 Tonnes registered with UK classification societies, and the number of UK registered ships continues to increase despite the recent down turn in the economy in both the domestic and international markets. We currently lack a holistic understanding of the shipping industry. Its drawn out contractual, technological and financial evolution has obscured access to both top-down and bottom-up system level understanding of its sensitivities and left many commercial habits engrained and unchanged for literally hundreds of years. The inescapable truths identified above can galvanise a reaction from all members of the shipping community, and we aim to capitalise on this.To understand the shipping system, the relationship between its principal components, transport logistics and ship designs, must be elucidated. Only then, can future logistical and ship concepts be optimised to achieve maximum reduction of carbon emissions. Through this understanding and optimisation, projections can then be made for future trends in the demand for shipping, the impacts of technical and policy solutions and their associated implementation barriers, and the most just measurement and apportionment mechanisms.These unique challenges can only be addressed with strong stakeholder involvement (we have significant commitments to our consortium from regulators: WWF, Lloyds Register, technologists: British Maritime Technologies, QinetiQ and Rolls Royce and operators: Shell, Fisher, David MacBrayne and the UK MoD, as well as wider support from a number of other companies across all constituents of the shipping industry). In addition, we have formed a multidisciplinary team (geographers, economists, naval architects, marine engineers, human factor experts and energy modelers) to ensure that specialist skills and experience can be shared whenever it is required. Using these assets we will undertake an aggregated, holistic, systems analysis of the shipping industry to elucidate and clarify the many complex interfaces in the shipping industry (port operations, owner/operator relationships, contractual agreements and the links to other transport modes). The analysis will extend to 2050, and involve the generation of future concept designs both for ships and infrastructure regimes. The model will project trends for global trade flows, but it will have particular focus on the UK's international and domestic passenger and freight transport.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,EP/H019995/1,,,,,,,,University of Hull,,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:15340630,,

The fjords tend to be tidally energetic and can be highly stratified because of freshwater runoff. Observations from instruments such as cyclesondes (profiling current meters), acoustic Doppler current profilers (ADCPs) and S4s (InterOcean vector averaging current meters) have yielded observations of the circulation over almost the entire water column. Combined with simulations from analytic and numerical models, these observations have allowed the partition of tidal energy in the fjords to be examined in some detail. The net tidal energy flux into a fjord (i.e., the rate at which energy is removed from the surface tide), and the cause of the energy flux, can vary significantly between fjords. The energy can be removed from the surface tide by boundary friction or by the generation of internal motions (i.e., the internal tide, hydraulic jumps etc.). In this paper the partition of tidal energy in five Canadian fjords and the techniques used to determine the partition will be reviewed. The analysis techniques will be described in some detail and, where possible, the relationship between the various analysis techniques will be pointed out.

Drilling sounds exhibited tones below 2 kHz, with harmonics present to 10kHz, while MLC excavation sounds were broadband in character. Drilling sounds varied substantially between the three operations, whereas MLC excavation sounds were more consistent in amplitude and spectral distribution.

J,,,,,,,,,Mattieu Cartigny,,New industry consortia with novel laboratory facilities that forms a UK national centre of excellence in submarine geohazards research,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Awarded Grant,Jan 06 2014,2014,"We propose to use these 'pump priming' funds to initiate an ambitious new industry consortium and UK centre of excellence for research into marine geohazards. Funding is sought specifically to: 1) set up an experimental laboratory with a set of novel sensors for imaging dense sediment flows, and 2) develop initial links with key industry stakeholders (e.g. FUGRO GeoConsulting Ltd).NOC has a strong submarine geohazards group whose work is based mainly on field observations; for instance it is leading a £2.3M NERC Consortium of tsunami-landslide hazards. It has just been awarded a £850k NERC grant to monitor active submarine flows in Monterey Canyon offshore California. Here we seek funding to develop a new experimental laboratory to test hypotheses posed by field observations.Full-scale flow observations in the field have recently confirmed an earlier hypothesis, which suggest that dense near-bed layers with high sediment concentrations often form a key part of turbidity currents. These dense layers are the most poorly understood and hence contentious part of turbidity currents, because most techniques can only image within the dilute top part of the flows. Dense near-bed layers are, however, important for geohazard analysis because their high density and basal position can exert large forces on infrastructure located close to the bed. The lateral loads they impose may result in displacement of pipelines, or in severe cases result in full bore rupture. The consequences may include economic loss, environmental effects and reputational damage to the operator. We now need to understand how these dense near-bed layers form and evolve, and what their impact is to exerted pressures and forces.Although previous experiments have successfully measured velocities within dense near-bed layers, sediment concentration measurements have so far not been possible within these layers due to their high sediment content. Here we seek funds to apply a new method of sediment concentration measurements based on Electrical Resistivity Tomography (ERT). ERT techniques are able to measures sediment concentration contrasts to characterise sedimentary reservoirs in the subsurface. This technique is not limited by sediment concentration and preliminary numerical simulations have shown that this technique can resolve sediment concentration profiles in dense near-bed layers of turbidity currents. We will use the novel ERT, in combination with velocity measurements to measure for a first time a combined velocity and sediment concentration profile through dense near-bed layers. Such simultaneous measurements will help to understand: i) what the maximum thickness of these dense layers can be, ii) how much sediment they are able to transport into the ocean, and iii) how large the impact of these layers can be on submarine pipelines.The second aim of this proposal is to develop links with FUGRO GeoConsulting Ltd. FUGRO performs risk assessments on marine geohazards for numerous oil and gas companies. As part of this assessment, numerical modelling provides a quantitative expression of likely impact and consequence to the integrity of seafloor structures. Flow densities and velocities of near-bed layers form vital inputs in these models. Currently inferred densities and velocities are required as model input, which are not well calibrated, and gross assumptions must be made. Therefore, this experimental work will provide useful direct input to improve the current model assumptions. The West Nile Delta will be used as a case study to show the direct impact of the experiments on real-world risk assessment calculations.The grant will also be used to transfer people and knowledge between FUGRO and NOC. This transfer will take place during a series of 3 meeting both at NOC and at FUGRO. Additionally two FUGRO consultants will spend 3 weeks at NOC to ensure a smooth transfer of knowledge from the experiments into the industry risk assessments.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,NE/L008130/1,,,,,,,,National Oceanography Centre,National Oceanography Centre,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:15304925,,

Therefore, numerical hydrodynamic models are frequently utilized for resource assessments. However, the relevant scales of the simulations and hence modeling techniques depend on the problem at hand. This paper shows the potential of the grid refinement technique for the assessment of tidal current energy for particular sites given its relatively low computational expense and high accuracy for the regions with the refined resolution. Example applications are described for mapping the tidal resources near two facilities ( Portsmouth Naval Shipyard in Maine and Key West Naval Station in Florida) for possible future deployments of Marine Hydro-Kinetic technologies. The grid refinement capability in the coupled ocean-atmosphere-wave-sediment transport modeling system is used to improve the spatial resolution in the regions of interest, and has shown significant advantage over the original simulation results for the tidal power assessment. The numerical simulation results from both the original coarse grids and the refined grids are validated with measured tidal constituents at available locations. This study demonstrates how the enhancement of a model system for a regional tidal energy with grid refinement can assist with the performance of site specific resource assessments with modest computational expense.

Understanding the changes to the near-and far-field hydrodynamics is necessary to assess optimal placement. MHK projects will convert energy (momentum) from the system, altering water velocities and potentially water quality and sediment transport as well. Maximum site efficiency for MHK power projects must balance with the requirement of avoiding environmental harm.This study is based on previous modification to an existing flow, sediment dynamics, and water-quality code (SNL-EFDC) where a simulation of an experimental flume is used to qualify, quantify, and visualize the influence of MHK energy generation. Turbulence and device parameters are calibrated against wake data from a flume experiment out of the University of Southampton (L. Myers and A. S. Bahaj, Near wake properties of horizontal axis marine current turbines, in Proceedings of the 8th European Wave and Tidal Energy Conference, 2009, pp. 558565) to produce verified simulations of MHK-device energy removal. To achieve a realistic velocity deficit within the wake of the device, parametric studies using the nonlinear, model-independent, parameter estimators PEST and DAKOTA were compared to determine parameter sensitivities and optimal values for various constants in the flow and turbulence closure equations. The sensitivity analyses revealed that the Smagorinski subgrid-scale horizontal momentum diffusion constant and the k-epsilon kinetic energy dissipation rate constant (C-epsilon 4) were the two most important parameters influencing wake profile and dissipation at 10 or more device diameters downstream as they strongly influence how the wake mixes with the bulk flow.

Shelving, funnelling, reflection, and resonance phenomena that have a significant effect on tidal range are also discussed. The paper then examines tidal energy resource for principal developments estimated from parametric modeling in Europe and worldwide. Basic parameters that govern the design of tidal power schemes in terms of mean tidal range and surface area of the enclosed basin are identified. While energy extracted is proportional to the tidal amplitude squared, requisite sluicing area is proportional to the square root of the tidal amplitude. Sites with large tidal amplitudes are therefore best suited for tidal power developments, whereas sites with low tidal amplitudes have sluicing that may be prohibitive. It is shown that 48% of the European tidal resource is in the United Kingdom, 42% in France, and 8% in Ireland, other countries having negligible potential. Worldwide, approximately 200, 50, 27, 20, 17, 17, 15, and 14 TWh of tidal resource annually are identified at Penzhinskaya Cauba (former USSR), Mezen (former USSR), Tugur (former USSR), San Jose (Argentina), The Severn (U.K.), Turnagain Arm (U.S.A.), Gulf of Cambay (India), and Cobequid (Canada), respectively.

Regarding a DC system which consists of multiple local zones with radial topology, a multi-port DC hub is introduced to serve as firewall between different zones. By blocking the converter with DC fault blocking capability in the corresponding DC hub port, the fault can be prevented from spreading among zones. On the other hand, an inter-zone protection centre is designed and built in the DC hub to implement the continuous operation under the situation of any port outage. Furthermore, in every local zone, the hybrid DC circuit breaker is installed in each branch at the side near the star point in order to isolate the faulty branch quickly and selectively via installing the smoothing reactor at the other side to restrict the fault current. Especially, a zone protection centre is designed and built in the star point of each zone to implement the fault detection and fault isolation. A detailed model of the DC system with the proposed protection strategy is built under PSCAD/EMTDC (TM) environment. Simulation results under different operating conditions demonstrate the feasibility and validity of the proposed strategy.",,,,,,,,,3,0,0,0,0,0,3,,,1752-1416,1752-1424,,,,,,,,,,"Tsinghua Univ, Grad Sch Shenzhen, Natl Key Lab Power Syst Shenzhen, Shenzhen, Peoples R ChinaChina Elect Power Res Inst, Beijing, Peoples R China",China Elect Power Res Inst,,,2017-12-06,WOS:000414303800003,,

The fish were identified to genus by the length of the caudal fin ventral lobe relative to standard length, reflectance from crystalline guanine, and relative mouth size to the head length. The width-length ratios suggest G. chuni as the species (approximately 1:5 for adult G. chuni vs. 1:10 for adult G. indica). The videos provided the second known in situ observation of giganturids and the first of G. chuni. The first video clearly shows two individuals in close proximity, with both oriented vertically in the water column; a second video clip shows a single individual at a slightly shallower depth, and also oriented vertically in the water column. An odds ratio comparison for collections of G. chuni and G. indica from the DEEPEND program to fitted theoretical distributions was used to preliminarily analyze the probability of encountering various numbers of individuals in a single-sample effort. Groups of two individuals, and in particular even number groupings, were encountered during the DEEPEND program sampling more often than would be expected based on theoretical distributions for both G. chuni and G. indica, suggesting pair-bonding may be a likely reproductive strategy complementing synchronous hermaphroditism in giganturids.",,,,,,,,,6,0,0,0,6,0,7,,,0045-8511,1938-5110,,,,,,,,,,"Louisiana State Univ, Dept Oceanog & Coastal Sci, Baton Rouge, LA 70803 USANova Southeastern Univ, Halmos Coll Nat Sci & Oceanog, Dania, FL 33004 USA",,,,2019-01-07,WOS:000454147400008,,

The relationship amongst salt bodies, faults and the distribution of pockmarks and mud volcanoes stresses the significance of these structures in focusing fluid flow on continental margins. The pockmarks were classified according to their structural setting and depth of source, and later correlated with seep data from the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM). Key findings include: a) half of the pockmarks are located within faults rooted on the top of salt diapirs, whilst 96% of the pockmarks are associated with salt diapirs - emphasising the importance of salt and crestal faults in focusing fluid flow to the sea floor; b) diffusion flow through the salt minibasins is clear due to the presence of soft amplitude anomalies (indicating fluids) and pockmarks located far from salt or faults; c) oil and gas are actively leaking to the sea floor; d) a higher density of fluid flow features are found in areas with steeper minibasin dips and greater catchment areas. While no clear correlation is evident between the morphological attributes and depth of source, the shallow plumbing system is dominated by pockmarks, whereas mud volcanoes are sourced from the deeper parts of the salt minibasins. In summary, this study uses a novel approach to analyse the plumbing system in a salt-rich basin based on the recognition of surface fluid flow features. The importance of characterising the fluid flow features and associated structures to reduce risk and uncertainty is stressed in terms of both shallow gas hazards and hydrocarbon leakage from deeper reservoirs.",,,,,,,,,22,1,0,0,1,1,23,,,0264-8172,1873-4073,,,,,,,,,,"Cardiff Univ, Sch Earth & Ocean Sci, 3D Seism Lab, Cardiff CF10 3AT, WalesBritish Geol Survey, Lyell Ctr, Res Ave South, Edinburgh EH14 4AP, Midlothian, Scotland",,,,2020-02-07,WOS:000509622600069,,

In this regard, no alternative is more promising today than nature-based solutions. Restoration of native ecosystems and the use of management concepts such as adaptive multi-paddock (AMP) grazing for ranchland have the potential to reliably store vast amounts of carbon in near-surface soil at very low cost. If only half of the existing US grazing lands is managed differently than now, these healthy soils could store from 10 to 23 percent of US carbon dioxide emissions every year. Moreover, healthy soils will significantly enhance the economic profitability and drought and flood resilience of ranches. To date, no trading system meets the needs and requirements of the private landowners that control the land that has the ability to sequester these immense amounts of carbon dioxide. The Soil Value Exchange (SVX) is designed to support landowners as they manage their property to promote healthy soils and soil carbon storage by (1) implementing a soil-carbon trading system based on robust soil carbon measurements that works for land owners and carbon credit buyers, (2) providing grants for land management consultant support, and (3) providing grants to support soil carbon measurements.

It suggests that treatment technologies based on electrochemistry could be the future of produced water management, since produced water is a potential electrolyte because it has a relatively good conductivity.

Ghana has had considerable experience designing the necessary environmental policies that are expected to guarantee safety from activities that may be dangerous to the environment. However, the current activities relating to the oil discovery go far beyond the environment.

Redox condition is an excellent proxy for oxygen levels, which control biogeochemical functions linked to valuable ecosystem services. The goal of this study was to quantify effects of crude oil on wetland soil redox conditions in cores collected from a salt marsh in Barataria Bay, LA. Treatments tested were nonoiled control, weathered crude oil at the soil surface, fresh crude oil at the soil surface, and a layer of buried weathered crude oil 5 cm beneath the soil surface to mimic the presence of buried oil found in marshes. No significant differences in redox potentials were detected among treatments at any depth at the end of the 35-d flooded, anaerobic study. After drainage of the cores began, redox was measured to the time to reach the aerobic threshold (+300 mV) within the rhizosphere. Mean redox values for control cores reached +300 mV after 193 h. Both fresh and weathered crude oil surface treatments reached +300 mV after 316 h while the buried crude oil treatment reached the aerobic threshold after 370 h.

However, often the main driver of invasion is not disturbance per se but alterations in the disturbance regime. In some fire-adapted shrublands, the community is highly resilient to infrequent, high-intensity fires, but changes in the fire regime that result in shorter fire intervals may make these communities more susceptible to alien plant invasions. This study examines several wildfire events that resulted in short fire intervals in California chaparral shrublands. In one study, we compared postfire recovery patterns in sites with different prefire stand ages (3 and 24 years), and in another study we compared sites that had burned once in four years with sites that had burned twice in this period. The population size of the dominant native shrub Adenostoma fasciculatum was drastically reduced following fire in the 3-year sites relative to the 24-year sites. The 3-year sites had much greater alien plant cover and significantly lower plant diversity than the 24-year sites. In a separate study, repeat fires four years apart on the same sites showed that annual species increased significantly after the second fire, and alien annuals far outnumbered native annuals. Aliens included both annual grasses and annual forbs and were negatively correlated with woody plant cover. Native woody species regenerated well after the first fire but declined after the second fire, and one obligate seeding shrub was extirpated from two sites by the repeat fires. It is concluded that some fire-adapted shrublands are vulnerable to changes in fire regime, and this can lead to a loss of native diversity and put the community on a trajectory towards type conversion from a woody to an herbaceous system. Such changes result in alterations in the proportion of natives to non-natives, changes in functional types from deeply rooted shrubs to shallow rooted grasses and forbs, increased fire frequency due to the increase in fine fuels, and changes in carbon storage.",,,,,,,,,122,1,0,0,112,1,148,,,0029-8549,1432-1939,,,,,,,,,,"US Geol Survey, Western Ecol Res Ctr, Sequoia Kings Canyon Field Stn, Three Rivers, CA 93271 USAUniv Calif Los Angeles, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA",,,,2012-08-01,WOS:000306494800018,22286083,

As part of this recommendation, OSPAR requires that the environmental risk of the discharge of produced water is characterized based on whole effluent toxicity (WET) studies and/or on a substance-based assessment. In this paper we describe an assessment of the likelihood that the environmental risk of produced water discharges is adequately controlled based on WET data for 19 oil- and gas-producing platforms and their discharge volumes. Our analysis shows that, with the selected risk criterion of predicted exposure concentration (PEC)/predicted no-effect concentration (PNEC) should not exceed 1 at 500 m, there is a mean likelihood of 99.5% (or more) that the environmental risk from the produced water discharges is adequately controlled for installations that discharge 30 x 10(3) m(3)/y (or less). The method presented in this paper can be used for screening purposes to ensure that efforts are directed toward installations with a high likelihood that risk is not adequately controlled.

Information about what motivates coral reef restoration as well as its success and cost is not well understood but needed to inform restoration decisions. We systematically review and synthesise data from mostly scientific studies published in peer‐reviewed and grey literature on the motivations for coral reef restoration, the variables measured, outcomes reported, the cost per hectare of the restoration project, the survival of restored corals, the duration of the project and its overall spatial extent depending on the restoration technique employed. The main motivation to restore coral reefs for the projects assessed was to further our ecological knowledge and improve restoration techniques, with coral growth, productivity and survival being the main variables measured. The median project cost was 400,000 US$ ha‐1 (2010 US$), ranging from 6,000 US$ ha‐1 for the nursery phase of coral gardening to 4,000,000 US$ ha‐1 for substrate addition to build an artificial reef. Restoration projects were mostly of short duration (1‐2 years) and over small spatial extents (0.01 ha or 108 m2). Median reported survival of restored corals was 60.9%. Future research to survey practitioners who do not publish their discoveries would complement this work. Our findings and database provide critical data to inform future research in coral reef restoration. Coral reef restoration databaseThis database represents the core part of the synthesis review Motivations, success and cost of coral reef restoration. It contains information on cost and success of restoration projects worldwide described by the published literature, some grey literature and a few personal communications. This database is an update of the coral reef section of the database The cost and feasibility of marine coastal restoration which captured information on the restoration of coral reefs, seagrass, mangroves, saltmarshes, and oyster reefs until November 2014. The update involves data extracted from the literature published until March 2018, data on motivations to carry out the restoration projects, information on whether the Standards for Ecological Restoration were followed by the projects, the category of the outcome reported and the variables measured to report on the project success. All economic values were updated with the newest data provided by The World Bank (March 2019). The coral reef restoration database contains the full reference, general information about the publication and project, the restoration action undertaken, species involved, location, a description on the type of cost reported, information on funding sources, project duration (in years), the area restored in hectare (ha), the converted restoration cost in 2010 US$ ha-1, feasibility information (including reasons for success or failure), and restoration success in terms of % survival of restored organisms. We accounted for pre-transplant (i.e. survival of coral spat/larvae in culture before rearing them in nursery or out-planting), transplant (i.e. survival of coral fragments during nursery period), post-transplant (i.e. survival of coral fragments after out-planting to the reef) survival as well as for the overall survival averaged over the former three categories.

The study site, where the CO2 -EOR operation is planned to be undertaken, is located in the pre-salt layer offshore Brazil. Perfluorocarbons (PFCs) were selected as tracers for monitoring possible CO2 leakage. A passive sampling technique was proposed to adsorb the injected tracer. Several commercially available sampler materials were initially chosen, among which Carboxen 569 placed inside a polyethersulphone (PES) membrane was tested and selected to be the preferred passive sampler combination. In order to perform tracer uptake rate experiments, a flow through experimental setup was built, optimized and tested under in-situ conditions of 300 bar and 15 degrees C. In addition, a desorption unit was designed to quantify the tracer amount sorbed to the sampler during the experiments. The developed passive sampler combination proved to be successful in sorbing the tracers. The phase distribution of the tracer candidates in a CO2-water-oil system were investigated in a slimtube setup. It is shown that the PFCs have a shorter travel time through the system than CO2 and will potentially provide a warning of CO2 leakage from the reservoir.Although the developed technique successfully proved the proposed concept of monitoring CO2 leakage, further testing to investigate the life cycle of the sampler will be necessary to apply this technique at field scale.",,,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,2,,,0920-4105,1873-4715,,,,,,,,,,"Inst Energy Technol, Inst Veien 18, NO-2007 Kjeller, NorwayPetr Brasileiro SA, R&D Ctr, CENPES, Av Horacio Macedo 950,C Univ, BR-21941915 Rio De Janeiro, RJ, BrazilFluminense Fed Univ, Inst Chem, Dept Analyt Chem UFF GQA, Niteroi, RJ, Brazil",,,,2020-09-16,WOS:000565555700002,,

The oil slick apparently did not cause significant increases in the concentrations of the trace elements studied, except vanadium. It appears that the magnitude of terrestrial inputs to coastal waters is sufficiently high to mask the inputs of trace elements from the fuel. The observed exception of V suggests that bioaccumulation of this element by the two species of Fucus may be used to indicate exposure to petrochemical products similar to the Prestige fuel.

We investigated the impacts of an urban gradient on microbat communities of habitat remnants on the Gold Coast, south-east Queensland, Australia. We conducted acoustic surveys of 34 sites categorised as urban, peri-urban or rural, with an additional five reference sites. A combination of landscape and habitat elements were quantified for each site and their influence on the richness and calling activity of microbats determined. Overall, more microbat species were detected in reference sites followed by peri-urban sites. Rural and urban sites had similar richness, but only 50 % overlap in species recorded. After accounting for sampling effort peri-urban sites were found to have the greatest species richness and calling activity. Three species accounted for 45.4 % of the variation in microbat species detected. Using generalised linear mixed models we found that site area and the extent of urban development in the landscape (i.e. urbanisation index) had the greatest impact on microbat richness and calling activity. Models including logging (clearfelling) and hollow-bearing tree measures were also important. Our results support the use of the urbanisation gradient as a key measure to quantify the impacts of urbanisation on biodiversity.

The Gulen final repository for radioactive waste from the oil and gas industry from the Norwegian continental shelf was opened in 2008 and has a capacity of 6000 tonnes.As of 1 January 2011, a new regulation was enforced whereby radioactive waste and radioactive pollution was integrated in the Pollution Control Act from 1981. This means that radioactive waste and radioactive pollution are now regulated under the same legal framework as all other pollutants and hazardous wastes. The regulation establishes two sets of criteria defining radioactive waste: a lower value for when waste is considered to be radioactive waste, and a higher value, in most cases, for when this waste must be disposed of in a final waste repository. For example, waste containing >= 1 Bq/g of Ra-226 is defined as radioactive waste, while radioactive waste containing >= 10 Bq/g of Ra-226 must be disposed of in a final repository. Radioactive waste between 1 and 10 Bq/g can be handled and disposed of by waste companies who have a licence for handling hazardous waste according to the Pollution Control Act. Alternatively, they will need a separate licence for handling radioactive waste from the Norwegian Radiation Protection Authority.The goal of the new regulation is that all radioactive waste should be handled and stored in a safe manner, and discharges should be controlled through a licensing regime in order to avoid/not pose unnecessary risk to humans or the environment.

These machines were chosen to represent a cross section of design for the device, foundation, installation and operation. Embodied energy was considered over the lifetime of each device. Energy use from fabrication, transport, installation, maintenance, decommissioning and recycling was all calculated and compared to the energy generated by each device. Finally, the embodied energy, CO2 intensity and energy payback periods were compared to those of conventional power generating systems and other renewable energy sources. Devices were studied based on a functional unit, defined as a 10 MW array installed for 100 years.

Our interdisciplinary approach aims to better inform the policy process, by combining biogeochemical and socioeconomic components of managed realignment schemes. Adding 7494 ha of new intertidal area to the UK Humber estuary through managed realignment leads to the annual accumulation of a 1.2 x 10(5) t of 'new' sediment and increases the current annual sink of organic C and N, and particle reactive P in the estuary by 150%, 83% and 50%, respectively. The increase in intertidal area should also increase denitrification. However, this positive outcome is offset by the negative effect of enhanced greenhouse gas emissions in new marshes in the low salinity region of the estuary. Short-term microbial reactions decrease the potential benefits Of CO2 sequestration through gross organic carbon burial by at least 50%. Net carbon storage is thus most effective where oxidation and denitrification reactions are reduced. In the Humber this translates to wet, saline marshes at the seaward end of estuaries. Cost-benefit analysis (CBA) was used to determine the economic efficiency of the Extended Deep Green managed realignment. When compared to a 'Hold-the-Line' future scenario, i.e. the present state/extent of sea defences in the estuary, the CBA shows that managed realignment is cost effective when viewed on > 25 year timescales. This is because capital costs are incurred in the first years, whereas the benefits from habitat creation, carbon sequestration and reduced maintenance costs build up over time. Over 50- and 100-year timescales, the Extended Deep Green managed realignment scenario is superior in efficiency terms. The increased sediment accumulation is also likely to enhance storage of contaminant metals. In the case of Cu, a metal that currently causes significant water quality issues, Cu removal due to burial of suspended sediment in realigned areas translates to a value of approximately 1000 pound a(-1) (avoided clean up costs). Although this is not formally included in the,CBA it illustrates another likely positive economic outcome of managed realignment. Although we focus on the Humber, the history of reclamation and its biogeochemistry is common to many estuaries in northern Europe. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

Neotectonic processes in coastal environments here have been shown to be important contributors to subsidence and relative sea-level rise, as well as having significant influences on sedimentary accretion processes. One active growth fault at East Matagorda Peninsula, Texas was subjected to detailed study to address the hypotheses that (1) this fault was present and active before the peak of regional hydrocarbon recovery in the mid-20th century, and that (2) slip along this fault has been episodic over the resolved period of record. To characterize the late Holocene behavior of this fault, three core transects were established normal to the surface fault trace, and stratigraphic analysis was conducted with the use of radiocarbon (C-14) for chronological control. Correlation of time-equivalent stratigraphic boundaries reveals a maximum total late Holocene offset of 0.7 m. The Matagorda fault was in place long before the peak of regional oil and gas extraction, but experienced a late Holocene rejuvenation, initiated between 2500 and 1500 years BP. The kinematic behavior of the fault expressed as temporally and spatially variable measures of expanded stratigraphic thicknesses on the downthrown extent suggest that sediment loading from the transgressive Matagorda barrier complex may have contributed to this rejuvenation, and that slip along the fault persists to the present. Radiocarbon chronology also revealed clear differences in the magnitude of fault throw during the late Holocene, with maximum displacement (0.7 m) occurring at the southwestern-most transect and minimum throw at the northeastern-most transect (0.2 m).

Gas hydrate reservoirs are composed of alternating beds of sand and clay, with various conditions of permeability, porosity, and hydrate saturation. This study looks into the multiphase flow behaviors of layered methane hydrate reservoirs induced by gas production. Firstly, a history matching model by incorporating the available geological data at the test site of the Eastern Nankai Trough, which considers the layered heterogeneous structure of hydrate saturation, permeability, and porosity simultaneously, was constructed to investigate the production characteristics from layered hydrate reservoirs. Based on the validated model, the effects of the placement of production interval on production performance were investigated. The modeling results indicate that the dissociation zone is strongly affected by the vertical reservoir's heterogeneous structure and shows a unique dissociation front. The beneficial production interval scheme should consider the reservoir conditions with high permeability and high hydrate saturation. Consequently, the identification of the favorable hydrate deposits is significantly important to realize commercial production in the future.",,,,,,,,,41,1,0,0,0,0,42,,,1468-8115,1468-8123,,,,,,,,,,"Jilin Univ, Key Lab Groundwater Resources & Environm, Minist Educ, Changchun 130021, Jilin, Peoples R China",,,,2017-01-01,WOS:000417768700001,,

This demonstrates how the trajectory of a deep water (> 1000 m) release in the central Faroe-Shetland Channel is influenced by explicitly resolving mesoscale processes. The finer resolution hydrodynamic model dramatically enhances the horizontal dispersion of oil and transports pollutant further afield. This is a consequence of higher mesoscale variability.

To investigate the validity of CO2 storage in the sub-seafloor, development of techniques to detect and monitor CO2 leaked from the seafloor is vital. Seafloor-based acoustic tomography is a technique that can be used to observe emissions of liquid CO2 or CO2 gas bubbles from the seafloor. By deploying a number of acoustic tomography units in a seabed area used for CCS, CO2 leakage from the seafloor can be monitored. In addition, an in situ pH/pCO(2) sensor can take rapid and high-precision measurements in seawater, and is, therefore, able to detect pH and pCO(2) changes due to the leaked CO2. The pH sensor uses a solid-state pH electrode and reference electrode instead of a glass electrode, and is sealed within a gas permeable membrane filled with an inner solution. Thus, by installing a pH/pCO(2) sensor onto an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV), an automated observation technology is realized that can detect and monitor CO2 leakage from the seafloor. Furthermore, by towing a multi-layer monitoring system (a number of pH/pCO(2) sensors and transponders) behind the AUV, the dispersion of leaked CO2 in a CCS area can also be observed. Finally, an automatic elevator can observe the time-series dispersion of leaked CO2. The seafloor-mounted automatic elevator consists of a buoy equipped with pH/pCO(2) and depth sensors, and uses an Eulerian method to collect spatially continuous data as it ascends and descends.Hence, CO2 leakage from the seafloor is detected and monitored as follows. Step 1: monitor CO2 leakage by seafloor-based acoustic tomography. Step 2: conduct mapping survey of the leakage point by using the pH/pCO(2) sensor installed in the AUV. Step 3: observe the impacted area by using a remotely operated underwater vehicle or the automatic elevator, or by towing the multi-layer monitoring system. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

We recorded 200 min of underwater noise during the construction of seven anchor pipes. Underwater noise was recorded simultaneously at three positions with a water depth of 9 m with increasing distance to the construction site to assess the disturbance potential to the marine fauna. The recorded vibration embedment noise was a continuous sound with durations of 2-55 s, with most energy below 1 kHz and peak frequencies around 900 Hz. Background noise level at a distance of approximately 1 km increased around 13 dB at frequencies between 800 and 1000 Hz. We estimated the sound propagation by a non-linear logarithmic regression by means of the intercept, slope and attenuation factor, which allowed us to evaluate the received sound levels that reach an animal in certain distances from the construction site. The estimated sound exposure level (SEL) of the source was 148.2 dB re 1 mu Pa(2)s and the median SEL ranged from 120 to 99 dB re 1 mu Pa(2)s at distances between 394 and 2288 m, respectively. Behavioural thresholds for indigenous species of marine mammals in the Wadden Sea as well as representative fish species were used to determine effect radii of vibration embedment noise. Our study showed that the detected anchor pipe vibration embedment noise might exert a behavioural reaction on a local scale. Marine mammals could be affected by the construction operations up to a distance of 375 m and fish up to a distance of 766 m. These zones of responsiveness for vibration embedment operations are relatively small, compared to pile driving, which is regularly used during construction operations. Our study shows that it is important to monitor and assess any kind of noise introduction to verify, whether a sustainable human use with respect to the complied guidelines is ensured without affecting the marine fauna.

Any cultivation step will almost certainly alter the population characteristics and, thus, alter the results on which any evaluation will be based. The need for cultivation-independent methods has, over the past 10 years, facilitated the development of several analytical methods for the determination of microbial identity, quantity, and, to some extent, function, applied directly to samples of the native population. This development so far has been fairly limited regarding practical application, and it has only recently been transferred to the offshore industry.In this paper, we demonstrate the features of these novel techniques and the benefits of applying them to two situations often encountered in offshore oil production in the North Sea-nitrate injection and MIC.The microbiological tools are based on the detection of the genetic material in microorganisms. The methods include direct counting of specific groups of microorganisms with microscopy by use of fluorescent in-situ hybridization (FISH) and other methods that are based on direct extraction of cell genetic material (i.e., DNA/RNA), such as quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) and denaturing-gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE). The paper will describe these relatively novel molecular techniques briefly.The paper documents the microbial-population shifts related to water breakthrough in a nitrate-treated reservoir and shows that key microbial populations can be identified and, thereby, this can lead to the creation of new and strengthened surveillance strategies on microorganisms that cause souring in these systems.Additionally, we have shown that when applying these novel techniques to aggressive corrosion attacks, especially under deposit corrosion, molecular techniques are powerful tools in identifying the most probable corrosion process in which microorganisms are implicated.These examples are described and related to offshore operations.

Optimizing this strategy requires understanding how carbon storage varies across environmental gradients. We explored variation in tree growth rate, tree longevity, and surface soil organic matter across 135 Connecticut River riparian forest plots. Tree growth rate did not vary significantly with climate but rather increased with sediment accretion rate, soil pH and decreased with plot elevation, where elevation was measured relative to the stage of the 2-year flood. By contrast, surface soil organic matter was negatively related to pH and tree growth rate. Tree species longevities were greater at higher elevations with coarser soils. The faster growth rates at lower elevations allow for restoring forest structure rapidly, whereas flood intolerant but longer-lived tree species allow more durable carbon sequestration at higher elevations. The close associations of growth rate, sediment accretion, and pH suggest that riverine nutrient inputs are important to maintaining the exceptionally high productivity of floodplains. Environmental assessments of river dams should consider impacts of intercepting sediments and reducing flooding on downstream floodplain fertility and productivity.

Especially characteristic of the industry are vast networks of pipelines that traverse tens of thousands of miles of land and sea to carry oil and gas from the deepest parts of the earth to faraway destinations. With such lengths come increased chances for damage, which can have disastrous consequences owing to the hazardous substances typically carried by pipelines. Subsea pipelines in particular face increased risk due to the typically harsher environments, the difficulty of accessing deepwater pipelines, and the possibility of sea currents spreading leaked oil across a wide area.

There are three important coastal adaptation strategies, viz. protection, accommodation, and retreat. All these measures involve technologies, often available or known to the scientific communities. The major challenge to adaptation is access to the adaptation measures, participation by all the stakeholders, and coordination at different levels.

An important part of plate tectonic theory is continental rifting and breakup, the process that begins the process of breaking apart a continent and ultimately can result in the formation of a new ocean. There are many continental margins on Earth where we know rifting has acted in the past and these margins are the source of much of the world's oil and gas resources, but there are limited places where we can witness the active processes that presently characterise the formation of a rift valley. Of the relatively small number of places on Earth where the process of continental rifting is just starting, the Gulf of Corinth, Greece stands out as a rare location of earthquake activity, high rates of the plate being split apart and a record of the rifting process contained in the sediments now filling the rift basin. Therefore it holds vital clues as to how a tectonic plate stretches and splits into two. The Corinth Rift has been studied for several decades, with scientists investigating its rift deposits and active fault traces exposed on land. But much of the activity is hidden below the inland sea of the Gulf of Corinth and in order to investigate this part of the rift, researchers have used marine geophysics to image the faults and sedimentary layers below the seafloor. They have also sampled the shallowest sediments using coring techniques. The has allowed us to see how faults have developed to create the basin and cause it to gradually subside as the rifting process evolves. We can also see how the sediment, eroded from the land surrounding the basin, has gradually filled the subsiding basin and records the movement of the faults through time. What has been lacking is direct sampling of these sediments over a significant part of the time since rifting began. This would enable us to determine how old the different sedimentary layers are and therefore how fast the faults are moving and how quickly the rift is opening and changing. Sampling and investigating the plants and animals living within and around the basin would also tell us the environment of the basin - was it a marine sea, a freshwater lake, or a series of river and delta systems and how has this changed as the rift has developped? These flora and fauna would also tell us about the local climate of this part of the Eastern Mediterranean and how this related to changes in the global climate in the last 1-2 million years, and how climate might have affected how and how much sediment was eroded and transported into the basin.The Integrated Ocean Discovery Program (IODP) will be drilling 3 boreholes in order to sample these rift basin sediments to answer the problems and questions raised above. This method, using a drillship, is the only way these sediments can be accessed. Approximately 32 scientists of a wide range of geoscience disciplines will analyse the cores and log data (which give information on the physical properties of the sediments) together over a period of 3 months offshore and onshore and then over a period of 3-4 years after the expedition. In addition, McNeill will take some of the drilling results and compare them with the already collected marine geophysical data to get a better idea of how fast faults are slipping, the basin is opening up, and how fast it has been subsiding, which can tell us how much the continental crust of the plate has thinned since the start of rifting. The results will be very relevant to understanding the potential for earthquake hazards in the region (how fast faults move is a major control on earthquake potential) and also to understanding how and where hydrocarbon resources collect within the earliest and deepest part of a rift system.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,NE/R016550/1,,,,,,,,University of Southampton,,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:15316609,,

In this work, we develop a coupled physical-metabolic model to assess the impact of mixing processes on these deep ocean bacterial communities and their capacity for hydrocarbon and oxygen use. We find that observed biodegradation patterns are well-described by exponential growth of bacteria from seed populations present at low abundance and that current oscillation and mixing processes played a critical role in distributing hydrocarbons and associated bacterial blooms within the northeast Gulf of Mexico. Mixing processes also accelerated hydrocarbon degradation through an autoinoculation effect, where water masses, in which the hydrocarbon irruption had caused blooms, later returned to the spill site with hydrocarbon-degrading bacteria persisting at elevated abundance. Interestingly, although the initial irruption of hydrocarbons fed successive blooms of different bacterial types, subsequent irruptions promoted consistency in the structure of the bacterial community. These results highlight an impact of mixing and circulation processes on biodegradation activity of bacteria during the Deepwater Horizon event and suggest an important role for mixing processes in the microbial ecology of deep ocean environments.",,,,,,,,,117,1,0,0,91,0,134,,,0027-8424,,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Dept Earth Sci, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USAUniv Calif Santa Barbara, Inst Marine Sci, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USAUniv Calif Santa Barbara, Dept Mech Engn, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USAUniv Rijeka, Fac Engn, HR-51000 Rijeka, CroatiaUSN, Res Lab, Stennis Space Ctr, MS 39529 USAAimdyn Inc, Santa Barbara, CA 93101 USA",Aimdyn Inc,,,2012-12-11,WOS:000312605600037,22233808,

A long-term (> 1year) experiment revealed 27-52% removal of dissolved organic carbon and a nonlinear increase in RDOM fluorescence associated with microbial turnover of semilabile DOM. This fluorescence was also produced using glucose as the only initial carbon source, suggesting that degradation of prokaryote remnants contributes to RDOM. Our results indicate that the formation of a fluorescent RDOM component depends on the bioavailability of the substrate: the less labile, the larger the production of fluorescent RDOM relative to organic carbon remineralized. The anticipated increase in microbial carbon demand due to ocean warming can potentially force microbes to degrade less labile substrates, thereby increasing RDOM production and stimulating ocean carbon storage.",,,,,,,,,73,4,0,0,52,0,74,,,0094-8276,1944-8007,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Copenhagen, Marine Biol Sect, DK-3000 Helsingor, DenmarkTech Univ Denmark, Natl Inst Aquat Resources, Charlottenlund, DenmarkNorwegian Polar Res Inst, Fram Ctr, Tromso, Norway",,,,2014-04-16,WOS:000334983000033,,

After installation of artificial upwelling structure, however, stratification formation depth and strength changed depending on currents directions. It seems that the change of stratification has a close relation with upwelling of lower temperature water. After installing the artificial upwelling structure, the distributions of vertical flows were analyzed. Local upwelling and downwelling flows showed a distinct time and spacial changes. Local upwelling flows caused by artificial upwelling structure appeared 100 times larger than coastal upwelling in the South-East Sea of Korea. Upwelling flows generated by the artificial structure raised the high concentration of nutrients to upper layer from lower layer breaking stratification in the summer.

In addition to contributing to the fulfillment of environmental commitments, the deployment of offshore wind energy is expected to be a lever for economic development. To assess gross economic impacts, mainly in terms of job creation, we built a regional input-output model of the wind farm off Saint-Brieuc located in the region of Brittany, north-western France. Our model indicates that the project will have positive effects on Brittany's economy. In particular, during the investment phase, the wind farm is expected to lead to a,notsign0.38 M/year/MW of added value and 6.03 full-time equivalent (FTE) jobs/year/MW. During the operation and maintenance (O&M) phase, the model predicts the generation of a,notsign0.15 M/year/MW of added value and 1.02 FTE jobs/year/MW. These results imply that the project will increase Brittany's GDP slightly by 0.22 and 0.09% during the investment and O&M phases, respectively. Results also show that out of total wealth created in France, 38 and 66% will be created in Brittany as well as 32 and 51% of employment during respectively investment and O&M phases. A comparative analysis highlights in particular that economic impacts are generally stronger during the investment phase. It also demonstrates that the magnitude of economic impacts depends on the proportion of local industries in the supply chain.

Although oil spills are typically high-profile disasters that release hundreds or thousands of chemicals into the environment, there is growing evidence for a common adverse outcome pathway (AOP) for the vulnerable embryos and larvae of fish species that spawn in oiled habitats. Molecular initiating events involve the disruption of excitation-contraction coupling in individual cardiomyocytes, which then dysregulate the form and function of the embryonic heart. Phenanthrenes and other three-ring (tricyclic) polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are key drivers for this developmental cardiotoxicity and are also relatively enriched in land-based urban runoff. Similar to oil spills, stormwater discharged from roadways and other high-traffic impervious surfaces contains myriad contaminants, many of which are uncharacterized in terms of their chemical identity and toxicity to aquatic organisms. Nevertheless, given the exceptional sensitivity of the developing heart to tricyclic PAHs and the ubiquitous presence of these compounds in road runoff, cardiotoxicity may also be a dominant aspect of the stormwater-induced injury phenotype in fish early life stages. Here we assessed the effects of traffic-related runoff on the embryos and early larvae of Pacific herring (Clupea pallasii), a marine forage fish that spawns along the coastline of western North America. We used the well characterized central features of the oil toxicity AOP for herring embryos as benchmarks for a detailed analysis of embryolarval cardiotoxicity across a dilution gradient ranging from 12 to 50% stormwater diluted in clean seawater. These injury indicators included measures of circulatory function, ventricular area, heart chamber looping, and the contractility of both the atrium and the ventricle. We also determined tissue concentrations of phenanthrenes and other PAHs in herring embryos. We find that tricyclic PAHs are readily bioavailable during cardiogenesis, and that stormwater-induced toxicity is in many respects indistinguishable from canonical crude oil toxicity. Given the chemical complexity of urban runoff, non-tricyclic PAH-mediated mechanisms of developmental toxicity in fish remain likely. However, from the standpoint of managing wild herring populations, our results suggest that stormwater-driven threats to individual survival (both near-term and delayed mortality) can be understood from decades of past research on crude oil toxicity. Moreover, Pacific herring embryos are promising sentinels for water quality monitoring in nearshore marine habitats, as in situand sensitive indicators of both toxic runoff and the effectiveness of pollution reduction efforts such as green stormwater infrastructure.",,,,,,,,,9,0,0,0,6,0,10,,,0166-445X,1879-1514,,,,,,,,,,"Washington State Univ, Puyallup Res & Extens Ctr, Sch Environm, 2606 W Pioneer Ave, Puyallup, WA 98371 USANOAA, Lynker Technol, Northwest Fisheries Sci Ctr, Natl Marine Fisheries Serv, 2725 Montlake Blvd E, Seattle, WA 98112 USANOAA, Northwest Fisheries Sci Ctr, Natl Marine Fisheries Serv, 2725 Montlake Blvd E, Seattle, WA 98112 USAUS Fish & Wildlife Serv, Washington Fish & Wildlife Off, 510 Desmond Dr SE, Lacey, WA 98503 USAWashington Dept Fish & Wildlife, POB 43200, Olympia, WA 98504 USA",,,,2021-01-05,WOS:000594707400009,33161306,

Disturbances, like large storms, have the potential to reduce the storage of carbon in salt marshes and lower their overall impact on the global carbon cycle. Previous studies have shown that large quantities of sediment were deposited on salt marshes in Louisiana after Hurricanes Katrina and Rita in 2005, but little was known about the state of the marshes before these impacts. Consequently, we can only speculate about the true impact of those storms on sediment carbon storage. Comparing pre-storm carbon storage to post-storm storage immediately (weeks to months) following landfall allows us to quantify the storm impacts and capture critical data before inventory signals are lost to the next event. This project will take advantage of the fact that the investigators have recently (2014) sampled salt marshes near both of the locations where Hurricane Harvey made landfall in August, 2017. They will collect new salt marsh sediment samples and compare their data to 2014 data in order to study the impact of storm passage on these important systems. Hurricane Harvey made landfall as a Category 4 storm at Rockport, TX, on 25 Aug 2017, moved inland, circled back, and made a second landfall as a tropical storm east of Port Arthur, TX, on 30 Aug 2017. These two major storm landfalls coincide with locations of salt marsh carbon burial studies performed in 2014 by this research group at the Aransas National Wildlife Refuge (NWR) and the Anahuac NWR. These data provide a baseline against which to assess the impacts of recent major storm landfalls on marsh accretion and carbon burial. It is imperative to return to these study sites as soon as possible to ensure that the perishable data resulting from the impacts of this storm on these marshes are not altered by other meteorological events or human disturbances. The investigators hypothesize hurricanes redistributed sediments from offshore and within the fringing salt marsh onto the marsh platform, increasing the elevation of the marsh and burying organic matter as stored carbon. The objectives of this research are 1) to quantify the impact of extratropical storm sediment accretion on carbon storage in two salt marshes at the local scale using 2014 baseline data; and 2) to extend these local storm-induced carbon changes to the landscape scale using pre- and post-storm LiDAR and satellite imagery. To address these objectives and preserve the perishable data, field work will take place at the Aransas and Anahuac NWRs during the week of 16 Oct 2017. Four 50 cm cores, two from each site, will be collected and sectioned based on stratigraphic changes. Sediment will be analyzed for total organic carbon, carbon-14, lead-210, and sediment physical properties (Obj. 1). Ground-truth measurements across the marsh will be obtained using a Macaulay auger and used to validate post- hurricane LiDAR measurements, which will be compared to pre-hurricane measurements from 2014 (Obj. 1 & 2). Freely available archived and new satellite imagery and LiDAR will be used to measure changes in marsh height and area (Obj. 2). The project will form part of the doctoral research of a graduate student, and will also support a senior undergraduate student.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,1760556,,,,,,,,University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill,,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:13746352,,

However, the many possible cycling mechanisms have hindered our ability to quantify marine organic matter transformation, degradation and turnover rates(3,4). Here we analyse existing and new measurements of the carbon: nitrogen ratio and radiocarbon age of organic matter spanning sizes from large particulate organic matter to small dissolved organic molecules. We find that organic matter size is negatively correlated with radiocarbon age and carbon: nitrogen ratios in coastal, surface and deep waters of the Pacific Ocean. Our measurements suggest that organic matter is increasingly chemically degraded as it decreases in size, and that small particles and molecules persist in the ocean longer than their larger counterparts. Based on these correlations, we estimate the production rates of small, biologically recalcitrant dissolved organic matter molecules at 0.11-0.14 Gt of carbon and about 0.005 Gt of nitrogen per year in the deep ocean. Our results suggest that the preferential remineralization of large over small particles and molecules is a key process governing organic matter cycling and deep ocean carbon storage.",,,,,,,,,68,1,0,0,36,0,79,,,1752-0894,1752-0908,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Calif Irvine, Dept Earth Syst Sci, 2212 Croul Hall, Irvine, CA 92697 USASUNY Stony Brook, Sch Marine & Atmospher Sci, CH123, Stony Brook, NY 11794 USAUniv Calif Santa Cruz, Dept Ocean Sci, 1156 High St, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USALawrence Livermore Natl Lab, CAMS, LLNL L397,7000 East Ave, Livermore, CA 94551 USA",,,,2016-12-01,WOS:000390478700014,,

In recent years, there have been significant engineering efforts to automate receiver deployment and retrieval in order to minimize the cost differential and conduct cost-efficient seabed receiver seismic surveys. These engineering efforts include industrially engineered nodes, nodes on a rope deployment schemes and even robotic nodes, which swim to and from the deployment location. This move to automation is inevitable, leading to robotization of seismic data acquisition for exploration and development activities in the oil and gas industry. We are developing a robotic-based technology, which utilizes autonomous underwater vehicles as seismic sensors without the need of using a remotely operated vehicle for deployment and retrieval.

Based on a limited number of properties (temperature, dissolved oxygen, total alkalinity and dissolved inorganic carbon), the composite tracer TrOCA was used to estimate the concentration of anthropogenic CO2 in the Otranto strait.Total alkalinity exhibits high values and weak variability throughout the water column of the strait, probably associated with the dense water formation processes in the Adriatic basin that induce a rapid transport of the coastal alkalinity to the deep waters. Elevated C-ant concentrations and high anthropogenic pH variations are observed in the bottom layer of the strait, associated with the presence of Adriatic Deep Water (ADW). The study shows that large amounts of C-ant have penetrated the highly alkaline Eastern Mediterranean waters, thereby causing a significant pH reduction since the pre-industrial era.Estimates of the transports of C-T and C-ant through the strait indicate that during February 1995, the Adriatic Sea imports through the Otranto strait natural and anthropogenic carbon and acts as a net sink of carbon for the Ionian Sea. The anthropogenic carbon that is imported to the Adriatic Sea represents less than 1% of the net C-T inflow. The Levantine Intermediate Water (LIW) contributes to about one-third of the total C-T and C-ant inflow. Although the amounts of C-T annually transported by LIW and ADW are almost equal, the contribution of C-ant to the C-T transported by each water mass is slightly higher in ADW (3.1%) than in LIW (2.6%), as a result of its higher mean C-ant concentration. The ADW, despite its weak contribution to the total outflow of C-ant has a vital role for the sequestration and storage of the anthropogenic carbon, as this water mass is the main component of the Eastern Mediterranean Deep Waters and, thus, the anthropogenic CO2 is transferred in the deep horizons of the Eastern Mediterranean, where it remains isolated for many years.

Blue Carbon refers to organic carbon that is captured and stored by the oceans and coastal ecosystems, particularly by vegetated coastal ecosystems: seagrass meadows, tidal marshes, and mangrove forests [1]. The global average carbon storage in the top metre of salt marsh soils is approximately 255 Mg/ha (with a range of 16-623 Mg/ha) [2].Unlike terrestrial ecosystems, carbon sequestered in coastal soils can be extensive and remain trapped for very long periods of time (centuries to millennia), resulting in very large carbon stocks. In blue carbon systems, the soil is saturated with water keeping it in an anaerobic state (low to no oxygen), and can accrete vertically at high rates, resulting in continuous build-up of carbon over time [3].Increasingly, coastal wetlands are being recognized for their important role in carbon sequestration and, when degraded, their potential to become sources of the greenhouse gases, carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide [4]. Because methane and nitrous oxide have global warming potentials that are, respectively, 25 and 310 times greater than carbon dioxide over 100 years, it is important to include the release of these gases as presenting a risk for future climate change. Release of greenhouse gases can be significant in salt marshes that experience reduced soil water salinities, changes in soil oxygen availability, and increases in anthropogenic nutrient loading [4].Griscom et al. (2017) [5] identified coastal wetland restoration and protection as a gap in mitigation options previously considered and estimated that these options have a global climate change mitigation potential in carbon dioxide equivalents of 1-2 Pg/y. This is higher than the estimated potential of any agricultural or grassland options, and comparable to the combined potential impact of restoration and protection of peatlands. Dynamic, process-based simulation models are needed to accurately predict the impacts of future changes in management and climate on carbon storage and greenhouse gas emissions, but whereas models have been developed to do this for peatlands [6], process-based models for coastal wetlands are missing; it is this gap that the proposed PhD will address.By modelling the carbon sequestered in coastal wetlands, we can more effectively identify options to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and increase soil carbon stocks, so producing high impact outputs and much needed information to support improved policies on the protection and restoration of coastal wetlands. This research will be under the framework of the newly established Scottish Blue Carbon Forum (SBCF) providing a conduit to governmental data and policy in support of model validation and impact.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,2445161,,,,,,,,University of Aberdeen,,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:15298393,,

Oil contamination affects all ecosystems, and the remediation of polluted sites using environmentally friendly strategies is crucial. Here, we report an analysis of the patent documents of potential petroleum bioremediation techniques that use microbes to clean seawater. The patent search was performed using Orbit Intelligence (R), SciFinder (R) and the Derwent World Patents Index (R). A group of 500 patent documents were validated according to the search objective and carefully studied. Increases in patent deposits coincide with periods following widely reported oil spills, suggesting a relationship between media disclosure and stimulation of innovation activities. China leads the list of countries with patent applications in bioremediation with 152 deposits, followed by Russia with 133 and the US with 48. These three countries have completely different temporal deposit profiles, influenced by their historical, political, and economic scenarios. A total of 368 patents described degradation of the oil compounds exclusively by bacteria, 24 by fungi and yeasts, 1 by Archaea, 1 using a microalgal strain, and 32 by mixed consortia. The leading microbial genera found in the patents are Pseudomonas (114 patents), Bacillus (75), and Rhodococcus (60). In the top-10 list of microbial strains mostly cited/claimed, no genera are obligate hydrocarbonoclastic bacteria. This fact, together with the broad pattern found in the main International Patent Classification (IPC) codes, suggest that most of the documents are general bioremediation approaches and not focused on oil-polluted seawater.

Based on our assumptions, built-up land expansion caused 3704.84 x 10(4) t of carbon storage loss from vegetation between 1995 and 2010. Cropland was the main built-up land expansion type across all regions. The study shows great regional differences. Coastal regions showed dramatic built-up land expansion, greater carbon storage losses from vegetation, and greater anthropogenic carbon emissions. These regional differences were the most obvious in East China followed by Midsouth China. These regions are under pressure for strong carbon emissions reduction.",,,,,,,,,106,4,0,0,28,0,110,,,0013-936X,1520-5851,,,,,,,,,,"Nanjing Univ, Sch Geog & Oceanog Sci, Nanjing 210023, Jiangsu, Peoples R ChinaLand Dev & Consolidat Technol Engn Ctr Jiangsu Pr, Nanjing 210023, Jiangsu, Peoples R ChinaMinist Land & Resources, Key Lab Dev & Protect Coastal Zone, Nanjing 210023, Jiangsu, Peoples R ChinaNanjing Univ, Jinling Coll, Sch Urban & Resources Sci, Nanjing 210089, Jiangsu, Peoples R ChinaNorth China Univ Water Resources & Elect Power, Zhengzhou 450011, Henan Province, Peoples R ChinaUniv S Carolina, Dept Geog, Columbia, SC 29205 USA",Land Dev & Consolidat Technol Engn Ctr Jiangsu Pr,,,2015-12-02,WOS:000364355300048,26421527,

Of the several reasons for public skepticism towards adoption of this technology, safety and reliability are leading concerns. Since the public's environment and standard of living can be directly affected through the implementation of carbon capture and geological storage, it is imperative that they feel confident in the safety and reliability of the technology. In addition, consumers may be expected to pay higher prices for electricity in order to facilitate the technology. Thus they will expect assurance that their investments are necessary and effective.Trinidad and Tobago (T&T) is one of the largest producers of fossil fuels in the Caribbean. T&T also emits approximately 38 million tonnes of carbon dioxide (Mt/CO2) per year. This amount is expected to increase due to the growth of the manufacturing sector within the country and is projected to reach as much as 50 Mt/CO2 by 2012. The country's relatively small population places T&T among the world leaders with respect to CO2 emissions per capita. In addition, the small island states such as T&T and the wider Caribbean are the most vulnerable to coastal erosion, rising sea levels and flooding due to intensive rainfall, all of which are forecast to be more severe if the climate grows warmer. The communication of these factors to the public of T&T is an essential part of gaining their acceptance of CCS technologies as a controlling factor for carbon dioxide emissions.The public's acceptance in T&T towards adopting geological CCS as a means of carbon dioxide emission mitigation is measured and reported in this paper. Such an exercise was conducted through the application of a random survey. However, since it was anticipated that a majority of the population would not have any previous knowledge of the technology, the survey contained an integral preamble briefly outlining this technology to the prospective sample. In addition, the survey was constructed such that the sample was separated into two main sections, those with prior knowledge of the technology and those without such previous knowledge.The results of these two factions are reported separately to ascertain whether prior knowledge of the technology greatly affected the eventual acceptance. The survey was constructed to highlight the technical, legal and economic issues. The results seem to indicate that though a greater number of participants felt that CCS was safe rather than dangerous (28% versus 25%) and the associated risks were known to science, a significant majority of them (90%) were still very concerned about leakage and environmental issues. It should be noted too that a very large proportion of the population (in some cases 33%) remained uncertain about critical safety issues and this large portion was greater than the respondents on either the safe or dangerous side. This result seems to indicate that a greater public awareness and informative campaign is needed in T&T before the population can be comfortable and confident on their position with respect to the technology.On the issue of funding a CCS project if needed most participants felt that this was the responsibility of either the government or related industries. However if they were made to pay via legislative force, most of them will comply (74%) but of these only a minority (18.5) was willing to comply with a 13% or greater hike in their monthly electricity bill.

One strategy to minimize effects of tarballs, slicks, and oil sheen, and subsequent risk to nearshore ecosystem resources was to use oil dispersants (primarily Corexit (R) 9500) at offshore surface and deepwater locations. Data have been generated reporting how Corexit 9500 and other dispersants may alter the acute toxicity of crude oil (Louisiana sweet crude) to marine organisms. However, it remains unknown how oil dispersants may influence bioaccumulation of petroleum hydrocarbons in nearshore crustaceans. We compare bioaccumulation of petroleum hydrocarbons in fiddler crabs (Uca minax) from exposures to the water accommodated fraction (WAF) of weathered Mississippi Canyon 252 oil (similar to 30 d post spill) and chemically-enhanced WAF when mixed with Corexit (R) EC9500A. Whole body total petroleum hydrocarbon (TPH) concentrations were greater than background for both treatments after 6 h of exposure and reached steady state at 96 h. The modeled TPH uptake rate was greater for crabs in the oil only treatment (k(u) = 2.51 mL/g/h vs. 0.76 mL/g/h). Furthermore, during the uptake phase TPH patterns in tissues varied between oil only and oil+dispersant treatments. Steady state bioaccumulation factors (BAFs) were 19.0 mL/g and 14.1 mL/g for the oil only and oil+Corexit treatments, respectively. These results suggest that the toxicokinetic mechanisms of oil may be dependent on oil dispersion (e.g., smaller droplet sizes). The results also indicate that multiple processes and functional roles of species should be considered for understanding how dispersants influence bioavailability of petroleum hydrocarbons.

J,,,,,,,,,Jon Henderson,,": Utilising Marine Cultural Heritage in East Africa to help develop sustainable social, economic and cultural benefits",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Awarded Grant,Sep 30 2017,2017,"The Rising from the Depths network will identify how the tangible submerged and coastal Marine Cultural Heritage (MCH) of Kenya, Tanzania, Mozambique and Madagascar, and its associated intangible aspects, can stimulate, ethical, inclusive and sustainable growth in the region. The multidisciplinary project team (experienced in challenge-led research and KE in ODA environments) will determine ways in which MCH can directly benefit East African communities and local economies, building identity, stimulating alternative sources of income (reducing poverty), and enhancing the value and impact of overseas aid in the maritime sector. East Africa is undergoing a period of profound change as the economy of the region gains momentum, driven by changing internal dynamics and by external interests. The region's maritime zone is central to these developments with offshore exploration for oil and gas deposits driving investment, coupled with major financing of new and established ports to facilitate trade with the Gulf countries. In addition to aid and investment from both the UK and other western governments, China and Saudi Arabia are funding major infrastructural and development projects across the region. While these developments have the potential to realise short-term economic, developmental and employment benefits, there has been little consideration of the impact of this work on the region's submerged and coastal heritage.Nascent maritime research in East Africa is just beginning to reveal the extent of maritime cultures and traditions across the region as well as the evidence for wider maritime activity that connected this coast to the broader Indian Ocean region. The sea in East Africa is a connector, a facilitator of communications, a supplier of resources that sustains life and an environment that is rooted in the belief systems of coastal peoples. For millennia this coast has been embedded within broader political and socio-economic domains, and witness to multiple migrations, invasions and trade activity. Its port towns and cities were intrinsically connected to a wider mercantile maritime world, ensuring it became one of the most culturally dynamic and diverse regions throughout history. It was, and continues to be, a region of continuous transformation and subject to a variety of anthropogenic and natural drivers of change. Development agreements very rarely take account of cultural heritage even though access to it is considered a fundamental human right. East African counties currently have little capacity to protect or explore their rich maritime heritage and, as a result, the socio-economic potential of MCH has yet to be realised. Worse, while the submerged resource is being impacted by marine exploitation, commercial salvage and offshore industry, the coastal resource is being threatened by building and development work as well as climatic and environmental change and even some green-energy projects. MCH is a fragile and finite resource, which once destroyed can never be recovered.This project will establish and maintain a transboundary and cross-sector network of arts and humanities-led researchers, government officers, scientists, policy makers, UN officials, NGOs, ICT professionals and specialists working in heritage, infrastructure and the offshore industry, to consider in what ways MCH can create long-lasting social, economic and cultural benefits in the region. The project will identify new opportunities and methodologies for arts and humanities research in an aid context and add value to coastal infrastructure and offshore development projects. Key mechanisms of engagement will be through the co-production of a Research and KE Framework, Innovation Projects and KE activities.The nations of coastal East Africa have aspirations to transform themselves into a thriving maritime gateway of trade and investment. The past has an active role in not only informing this development but in helping drive it.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,AH/R005443/1,,,,,,,,University of Nottingham,,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:15352637,,

These materials are exposed to a wide variety of severe operating conditions that can range from marine atmospheres to splash zone exposures in brackish and salt water. Typically, these devices are all large cylinders that are difficult to test because of the curvature of the external surface. The present work describes a novel testing methodology, based on the zero-resistance amperometry (ZRA), which allows the determination of the critical pitting temperature (CPT) as well as the critical crevice temperature (CCT) in small curved samples sectioned from tensioner risers and piston rods. The samples were made of carbon steel cylinders with a thick metallic coating (i.e., weld overlay) of a corrosion-resistant alloy (CRA). Moreover, the determination of the CPT and the CCT is a rapid way of prescreening candidate materials and alloys for applications that are not necessarily limited to the oil and gas industry. Several solid materials and CRA-coated carbon steel samples have been prescreened successfully using this testing methodology. The relative ranking of the CPT values of these CRA materials have been used to determine the quality of the metallic coating and the relative corrosion resistance of the material. Interestingly, two critical temperatures were found when the materials were tested with crevice formers. It is hypothesized that while part of the sample underwent crevice corrosion at the lower CCT, the rest of the surface remained unaffected. At higher temperatures, pitting corrosion took place in the areas that remained passive, leading to a second sharp current increase associated with their CPT.",,,,,,,,,4,1,0,0,0,0,5,,,0010-9312,,,,,,,,,,,"Det Norske Veritas USA Inc, Mat & Corros Technol Ctr, Dublin, OH 43017 USA",Det Norske Veritas USA Inc,,,2011-12-21,WOS:000297311700008,,

Also, the dynamic response of a caisson-type structure resting on pile foundation loaded by waves was numerically evaluated by FEM analysis in order to investigate the feasibility of a pile with an expanding end to support such offshore structure foundations.The results obtained in this research is summarized as follows :1) The displacement response at an estimating location under a caisson structure becomes small and the phase angle is large as the non-dimensional frequency wa/Vs and the depth z/a of an estimating location increases. Consequently, the displacement response of seabed under a caisson structure greatly depends on the skirt length of a caisson structure as seen in the displacement response of a caisson itself.2) It is necessary to give careful consideration to the behavior of both the displacement and phase responses in case of installing a caisson structure with suction on the seabed, whose stiffness and shear wave velocity are small.3) The dynamic response of pore water pressure under caisson has a maximum value in the vicinity of compartments, and also gradually decreases with the distance from the bottom of caisson increasing.4) When a caisson is installed on a pile foundation, the displacement response in the seabed around the pile foundation, as well as that of the caisson, are almost similar regardless of the connecting condition between caisson and piles.5) The pile foundation prevents the differential settlement in the seabed under a caisson, because the wave-induced pore water pressure beneath the caisson is distributed to the deep foundation around the expanding base.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,9650558,,,,,,,,Maizuru National College of Technology,Maizuru National College of Technology,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:14203331,,

Here, we examined the effects of mangrove expansion on below-ground properties related to peat development and carbon storage. We investigated plant-soil interactions in marshes and across mangrove forest structural gradients in three locations in the northern Gulf of Mexico (USA). We compared our results to those from terrestrial grasslands where the effects of woody plant encroachment are often influenced by rainfall and plant traits. Abiotic conditions at our study locations differed, particularly in terms of physicochemical properties related to precipitation. Marsh species composition, marsh above-ground biomass, and mangrove forest structural complexity also varied across these locations. Marshes in the driest location (Central Texas) had higher salinities and were dominated by low biomass succulent plants and lower soil carbon pools. Marshes in the wetter, less saline locations (Louisiana and North Florida) contained high biomass grasses and higher soil carbon pools. At all locations, above-ground biomass and above-ground carbon pools were higher in mangroves than marshes; however, below-ground soil carbon pools were only higher in mangroves than marshes in the driest location. In the wetter locations, the linkages between mangrove forest structure and soil properties were minimal or not significant. However, in the driest location, there was a significant increase in soil properties related to peat development and carbon storage with increased mangrove forest structural development.Synthesis: Our results indicate that the ecological implications of woody plant encroachment in tidal saline wetlands are dependent upon precipitation controls of plant-soil interactions. Although the above-ground effects of mangrove expansion are consistently large, below-ground influences of mangrove expansion appear to be greatest along low-rainfall coasts where salinities are high and marshes being replaced are carbon poor and dominated by succulent plants. Collectively, these findings complement those from terrestrial ecosystems and reinforce the importance of considering rainfall and plant-soil interactions within predictions of the ecological effects of woody plant encroachment.",,,,,,,,,96,2,0,0,75,0,106,,,0022-0477,1365-2745,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Louisiana Lafayette, Dept Biol, Coastal Plant Ecol Lab, 410 East St Mary Blvd,Room 108, Lafayette, LA 70503 USAUS Geol Survey, Wetland & Aquat Res Ctr, 700 Cajundome Blvd, Lafayette, LA 70506 USAUniv Louisiana Lafayette, Inst Coastal & Water Res, Dept Biol, 410 East St Mary Blvd,Room 108, Lafayette, LA 70503 USA",,,,2016-07-01,WOS:000379015400014,,

The UK enjoys some of the world's best marine energy resources and is a world leader in the research, development, demonstration and deployment of wave and tidal energy systems. To increase that lead, we must be able to develop ever more accurate models of these and future systems before entering the sea, if we are to optimise their behaviour and performance under realistic combinations of waves and tidal currents. This demands a combined wave and current test tank. Such a tank will also extend our understanding of the effects of environmental features such as islands and coastlines on wave and tidal energy devices. Conversely, we would also better understand the impacts of these devices on the environment and the tank would have wider applications in optimising maritime and coastal defence. To mimic reality in full, waves and currents in the tank must be able to act in any combination, in any relative direction. The realistic wave and tidal tank (RealWATT) described below will create wave and tidal conditions that represent, at scale, any prospective marine energy or coastal site in the UK. It will be able to model conditions equivalent to years at sea in a few hours and will create normal and extreme conditions reliably and repeatedly. There is no combined test tank in the UK or Europe that can do this.The marine renewable industry is developing rapidly. However, most types of wave energy converters are vulnerable to currents and most tidal current energy converters are vulnerable to waves. Although wave tanks and current flow facilities do exist, there are no facilities which can create the necessary wide spectral wave conditions, in terms of both spatial and frequency parameters, coincident with robust current conditions at laboratory scales necessary to give confidence in the research and developmental testing necessary to support the next generation of marine energy converters. Marine currents are rarely simple or unidirectional and usually have complex variations of velocity texture and gradient. Ocean waves are also multi-directional and their height, period, steepness and spectral content vary in equally complex ways. The design of this new test facility takes this into account.The overarching objective of SuperGen Marine Phase 2 is to understand the device-sea interactions across the range of scales from the laboratory to the open sea, when subject to the combined effects of waves and tidal currents and this has give us considerable insight into the need for this tank. Early device deployments have been at tidal sites which are sheltered from waves and wave sites in which currents were expected to be low. Many of the first generation of full scale wave energy prototypes have experienced operational difficulties due to current effects on moorings, with consequent effects on stability and performance. Even in the absence of tidal currents, wave induced currents in coastal waters can have an influence on behaviour. Tidal developers have avoided sites exposed to large waves. The European Marine Energy Centre (EMEC) tidal test site at the Fall of Warness in Orkney was chosen as it is partly sheltered from wave action as was the Strangford Narrows site in Northern Ireland, where SeaGen is deployed. Many of the most energetic tidal current sites are not, however, so sheltered. The Pentland Firth, which is recognised as one of the most significant sites for long term development, and is now the subject of a Crown Estate licensing round, is exposed to significant Atlantic swell. If the industry is to develop and exploit the most energetic sites, research must continue to understand device behaviour in controllable combined waves and currents at model scale in laboratories.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,EP/I02932X/1,,,,,,,,University of Edinburgh,,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:15349843,,

These pipelines are operated in elevated temperatures and pressures those are much higher than the ambient conditions. That will causes axial expansion in the pipeline, if such expansion is restrained by soil friction, the compressive force will be built up in the pipe, finally, induces the buried pipeline to buckle in the vertical plane. This paper investigates the effect of uncertainty in soil, operating condition and pipe properties on upheaval buckling behaviour of offshore pipeline buried in clayey soil. To simulate the upheaval buckling, a 2-D finite element model of 500 m long pipeline-seabed soil system was developed in OpenSEES using the thermal element. Using the finite element model prediction of upheaval budding height, a total number of 12 upheaval buckling height prediction models were proposed by using genetic programming with varying levels of complexity and accuracy. To achieve the best performance model, a scoring table was proposed considering several factors including coefficient of determination, sum of errors, difference between training and testing errors, sum of residuals, deviation of predicted results from experimental one and complexity and generality of the models. Finally, the effect of each parameter on upheaval budding displacement was studied by parametric analysis and the results were compared by simulated ones. On the basis of the results, most of the models. developed using genetic programming show very good prediction with the numerical results. The developed model can be used to improve the design and upheaval bucking risk assessment of buried pipeline. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Structural components of habitat that are combustible and slow to develop are particularly susceptible to change associated with prescribed burning. We used an experimental, whole-landscape approach to investigate the effect of differing patterns of prescribed burning on key habitat components (logs, stumps, dead trees, litter cover, litter depth, and understorey vegetation). Twenty-two landscapes (each similar to 100 ha) were selected in a dry forest ecosystem in southeast Australia. Experimental burns were conducted in 16 landscapes (stratified by burn extent) while six served as untreated controls. We measured habitat components prior to and after burning. Landscape burn extent ranged from 22% to 89% across the 16 burn treatments. With the exception of dead standing trees (no change), all measures of habitat components declined as a consequence of burning. The degree of loss increased as the extent to which a landscape was burned also increased. Prescribed burning had complex effects on the spatial heterogeneity (beta diversity) of structural components within landscapes. Landscapes that were more heterogeneous pre-fire were homogenized by burning, while those that were more homogenous pre-fire tended to display greater differentiation post-burning. Thus, the notion that patch mosaic burning enhances heterogeneity at the landscape-scale depends on prior conditions. These findings have important management implications. Where prescribed burns must be undertaken, effects on important resources can be moderated via control of burn characteristics (e.g., burn extent). Longer-term impacts of prescribed burning will be strongly influenced by the return interval, given the slow rate at which some structural components accumulate (decades to centuries). Management of habitat structural components is important given the critical role they play in (1) provision of habitat resources for diverse organisms, (2) retention of moisture and nutrients in otherwise dry, low-productivity systems, and (3) carbon storage.",,,,,,,,,21,0,0,0,21,0,22,,,1051-0761,1939-5582,,,,,,,,,,"La Trobe Univ, Dept Ecol Environm & Evolut, Bundoora, Vic 3086, AustraliaDELWP, Arthur Rylah Inst Environm Res, Heidelberg, Vic 3081, Australia",,,,2017-05-03,WOS:000398577200011,27992957,

To cope with this limitation, this paper proposes a configuration that integrates a Battery Energy Storage System (BESS) in the O&G platform. The manuscript focuses on how to appropriately size the BESS through a techno-economic study that considers both investment and operation costs, along with the possibility for economic benefits in terms of fuel savings and CO2 emissions reductions. The results, obtained using aggregated field data from a real platform, indicate that the sized BESS enables fuel savings and higher levels of wind power penetration.

Rifting and sediment fill began in the Late Triassic. Egret source rock was deposited in the Late Jurassic at about 153 Ma. After this time, alternating reservoir rock and seal rock were deposited with some syndepositional faulting. By the end of the Early Cretaceous faults and folds had formed nu, merous structural traps. For the next 100 m.y., overburden rock thermally matured the source rock when it reached almost 4 km (2.5 mi) burial depth. For 2 km (1.25 mi) below this depth, oil and gas were expelled, until the source was depleted. The expelled petroleum migrated updip to nearby faulted, anticlinal traps, where much of it migrated across faults and upsection to the Hibernia Formation (44% recoverable oil) and Avalon Formation (28%). Accumulation size decreased, and gas content increased from west to cast, independent of trap size. These changes correspond to a decrease in source rock richness and quality from west to east.Almost all (96%) of the discovered petroleum resides in the Lower Cretaceous or older reservoir rock units All accumulations. found to date are normally pressured in structural traps. Fifty-two exploration wells found eighteen discoveries. Their size ranges from 1.2 to 0.01 billion BOE. Most discoveries were made between 1979 and 1991.

Existing research, e.g. as summarised by Meehl et al. (2007), estimates potentially considerable additional warming resulting from stable present-day atmospheric GHG concentrations. We use the Equilibrium Climate Sensitivity (ECS) values of the latest set of Earth System Models (ESMs) in the CMIP6 ensemble, to estimate equilibrium global warming. Radiative forcing characterises the combined effect of human-induced changes to all GHGs and aerosols in a single metric. We find that based on the ECS values and contemporary radiative forcing, additional warming would be substantial. Approximately half of CMIP6 ESMs project an equilibrium global warming greater than two degrees (compared to pre-industrial times) for the year 2019 radiative forcing. This statistic increases to around 80% for the risk of exceeding the 1.5 degrees C threshold. Our analysis is specific to what is sometimes referred to as the constant composition commitment.

However, it also produces new coastal erosion near area. Recently, the artificial reef (A.R.) is almost constructed on the standpoint of landscape as coastal erosion measures in Korea. A.R. is a submerged breakwater with wide crest and had developed to overcome weakness on the detached and submerged breakwaters.

The multidisciplinary project team (experienced in challenge-led research and KE in ODA environments) will determine ways in which MCH can directly benefit East African communities and local economies, building identity, stimulating alternative sources of income (reducing poverty), and enhancing the value and impact of overseas aid in the maritime sector. East Africa is undergoing a period of profound change as the economy of the region gains momentum, driven by changing internal dynamics and by external interests. The region's maritime zone is central to these developments with offshore exploration for oil and gas deposits driving investment, coupled with major financing of new and established ports to facilitate trade with the Gulf countries. In addition to aid and investment from both the UK and other western governments, China and Saudi Arabia are funding major infrastructural and development projects across the region. While these developments have the potential to realise short-term economic, developmental and employment benefits, there has been little consideration of the impact of this work on the region's submerged and coastal heritage.Nascent maritime research in East Africa is just beginning to reveal the extent of maritime cultures and traditions across the region as well as the evidence for wider maritime activity that connected this coast to the broader Indian Ocean region. The sea in East Africa is a connector, a facilitator of communications, a supplier of resources that sustains life and an environment that is rooted in the belief systems of coastal peoples. For millennia this coast has been embedded within broader political and socio-economic domains, and witness to multiple migrations, invasions and trade activity. Its port towns and cities were intrinsically connected to a wider mercantile maritime world, ensuring it became one of the most culturally dynamic and diverse regions throughout history. It was, and continues to be, a region of continuous transformation and subject to a variety of anthropogenic and natural drivers of change. Development agreements very rarely take account of cultural heritage even though access to it is considered a fundamental human right. East African counties currently have little capacity to protect or explore their rich maritime heritage and, as a result, the socio-economic potential of MCH has yet to be realised. Worse, while the submerged resource is being impacted by marine exploitation, commercial salvage and offshore industry, the coastal resource is being threatened by building and development work as well as climatic and environmental change and even some green-energy projects. MCH is a fragile and finite resource, which once destroyed can never be recovered.This project will establish and maintain a transboundary and cross-sector network of arts and humanities-led researchers, government officers, scientists, policy makers, UN officials, NGOs, ICT professionals and specialists working in heritage, infrastructure and the offshore industry, to consider in what ways MCH can create long-lasting social, economic and cultural benefits in the region. The project will identify new opportunities and methodologies for arts and humanities research in an aid context and add value to coastal infrastructure and offshore development projects. Key mechanisms of engagement will be through the co-production of a Research and KE Framework, Innovation Projects and KE activities.The nations of coastal East Africa have aspirations to transform themselves into a thriving maritime gateway of trade and investment.

This is currently the only location of oil and gas production in Greece. Facilities are located both offshore (Kappa and Delta platforms) and onshore (Sigma plant), producing sweet gas, sour gas, and sour crude oil. This study presents the characteristics of atmospheric emissions, including emission measurements, emission inventories, and concentration measurements, from a central monitoring station and twelve total sulfation stations, the latter aiming to assess the effects of atmospheric emissions to air quality. During the development of the monitoring system, special attention was placed to sulfur compounds, since the existence of sour gas and sour crude oil was expected to lead to increased amounts of H2S and SO2. One of the main findings of the present study is that if the prevailing wind direction is considered (i.e., from N-NE), then the central monitoring station is not located downwind of the onshore and offshore facilities; therefore, its position should be re-examined. The emission inventories showed that flaring at the offshore facilities is the main source of SO2 emissions, while SO2 emissions and ambient concentrations were well below the relevant standards. Furthermore, CO2 emissions were lower by 67.73% as compared to 2008, when emissions reached a maximum. This was attributed to more energy demanding activities during that period, and mainly to the operation of turbines between 2007 and 2009. Since it is expected that the exploitation of hydrocarbons as well as oil and gas extraction and production will increase in the future in Greece, appropriate measures should be taken to ensure environmental protection, such as the use of up-to-date emission control technologies and a flare gas recovery system.",,,,,,,,,8,0,0,0,2,0,8,,,2073-4433,,,,,,,,,,,"Hellen Open Univ, Sch Sci & Technol, 18 Aristotelous St, Patras 26335, Greece20 Kalogera St, Athens 11361, Greece",,,,2018-06-28,WOS:000435178000038,,

Still, the potential hazards of chemical dispersants onto the marine ecosystem have motivated the research for environmentally friendly alternative while keeping exceptional dispersion ability. Here, we showed that the mixture of palygorskite (PAL) and rhamnolipid (Rha) formed a biocompatible alternative to synthetic surfactants used for oil spill dispersion. The oil droplets dispersed by R-PAL presented a small average size and long-term stability, which illustrated the synergistic interactions between Rha and PAL acting as an efficient dispersant in artificial sea water (ASW). Due to the strong flocculation caused by high salinity, PAL alone was not effective emulsifiers in ASW. A small amount of Rha could played a major role in modifying the surface characteristics of PAL and decreasing oil-water interfacial tension. Therefore, PAL particles irreversibly adsorbed onto the oil-ASW interface and formed a rigid interfacial film around oil droplets in the presence of Rha, which offered an efficient barrier to droplet coalescence. The synergistic interactions between PAL and Rha could enable the dispersion of tetradecane in ASW. Such a functionality was further tested in dispersing crude oil in ASW. The study presents a new strategy of using a mixture of PAL and Rha for oil dispersion, thus providing an ecofriendly alternative to conventional dispersants. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Even though several approaches have been recommended based on small-scale laboratory tests, there is no widely accepted method for the design of monopiles under lateral loading. Conversely, field testing on large-diameter prototype monopiles is normally impractical due to the high demand on the capacity of loading equipment. For these reasons a series of field lateral loading tests on reduced-scale monopiles were conducted at a dense sand test bed site. The model monopiles had similar aspect ratios of pile length to diameter to those used in the offshore wind farm projects, but were smaller in scale. Experimental p-y curves were derived using the measured monopile responses of the lateral load tests, and a distinctive failure model was presented for monopiles in the overconsolidated dense sand deposit. Comparison of lateral responses of monopile between the measured and predicted by two current p-y models showed the shear force at the pile tip plays an important role and should be accounted for in the design of laterally loaded rigid monopiles.

Carbon storage in such forests has economic value independent of additionality, offering opportunities for policy makers to ensure their maintenance, and inclusion in climate change mitigation strategies. Mangrove forests of the Everglades National Park (ENP), South Florida, though protected, face external stressors such as hydrological alterations because of flooding control structures and agriculture impacts and saltwater intrusion as a result of increasing sea level rise. Moreover, decreased funding of Everglades' restoration activities following the recent economic crisis (beginning 2008) threatens the restoration of the Greater Everglades including mangrove dominated coastal regions. We evaluate several economic and ecological challenges confronting the economic valuation of total (vegetation plus soil) organic carbon (TOC) storage in the ENP mangroves. Estimated TOC storage for this forested wetland ranges from 70 to 537 Mg C/ha and is higher than values reported for tropical, boreal, and temperate forests. We calculate the average abatement cost of C specific for ENP mangroves to value the TOC from $2-$3.4 billion; estimated unit area values are $13,859/ha-$23,728/ha. The valuation of the stored/legacy carbon is based on the: 1) ecogeomorphic attributes, 2) regional socio-economic milieu, and 3) status of the ENP mangroves as a protected area. The assessment of C storage estimates and its economic value can change public perception about how this regulating ecosystem service of ENP mangrove wetlands (144,447 ha) supports human well-being and numerous economic activities. This perception, in turn, can contribute to future policy changes such that the ENP mangroves, the largest mangrove area in the continental USA, can be included as a potential alternative in climate change mitigation strategies.

Marine-borne plastics pose new risks to marine life and ecosystems and their impacts on human health are largely unknown as they enter the food chain. Recently, several projects have been initiated worldwide to collect marine plastics using shipboard harvesting approaches. On-board conversion of marine-borne plastics to useful products is a promising technology that could address the limitations of current shipboard harvesting approaches. With support from the Environmental Engineering Program in the Division of Chemical, Bioengineering, Environmental, and Transport Systems and the NSF 2026 Fund Program in the Office of Integrated Activities, Professors Kazantzis and Timko at Worcester Polytechnic Institute propose to explore the feasibility of designing an on-board hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) system that could harvest and convert marine-borne plastics into useful products including oil, gas or solvents. To achieve this goal, the investigators propose to first develop a modeling framework to simulate the performance of an on-board HTL plastic conversion system. The successful completion of this project will benefit society through helping advance the design and implementation of next-generation technologies to address the global problem of marine plastic pollution. Further benefits to society will be achieved through student education and training, and public outreach including the mentoring of a female doctoral student. <br/><br/>Every year between 4.8 and 12.7 million tons of plastics are released into oceans and marine ecosystems. Hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) is a promising technology that could convert marine-borne plastics into useful products. The HTL process utilizes a high-temperature and high-pressure reactor to break down plastics into monomers and/or smaller organic compounds, which are then mixed with water to produce oil, gas or solvents. The overarching goal of this EAGER project is to explore the design of an on-board system with the capability to draw in desalinated water and plastics into a HTL reactor to generate useful products. Because the conversion of plastic wastes is not yet practiced commercially, the development of an on-board HTL system is an ambitious and inherently risky undertaking. Thus, the PIs propose to develop a new probabilistic modeling and assessment framework to characterize the technical feasibility, the sustainability profiles as well as the economic viability prospects of an on-board plastic conversion HTL process system by combining thermodynamic modeling (exergy analysis) with TEA and LCA. To account for the uncertainties and related technology risks, the investigators propose to use Monte Carlo simulations to stochastically model and propagate the sources of uncertainties in the model input parameters. This could enable the PIs to generate performance outcome zones and risk-reward distribution profiles rather than single-point estimates of the relevant performance parameters of the proposed on-board HTL plastic conversion system. Thus, the successful completion of this project has potential for transformative impact through the development a new system-modeling framework to advance the design of integrated shipboard collection and reactor systems that could capture and convert marine-borne plastics into useful products.<br/><br/>The supported project further expands the concept from one of the top 33 NSF 2026 Idea Machine entries: Repurposing, Recycling, Renewable Energy.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,2032621,,,,,,,,Worcester Polytechnic InstituteWorcester Polytechnic Institute,,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:15137536,,

Each component or sensor that produces information, unique to its position, will have a point that is considered as the reference point of that sensor. The accurate measurement of the offsets is vital to establish the mathematical relation between sensor and vessel common reference point in order to achieve sufficient accuracy of the survey data. If possible, the vessel will be put on a hard stand so that it can be very accurately measured using the standard land survey technique. However, due to the complex environment and sensors being mobilized when the vessel is in service, this may not be possible, and the offsets will have to be measured in sea dynamic conditions by means of a total station from a floating platform. This article presents the method of transformation by similarity with elements of affine transformation, called Q-ST (Quasi-Similarity Transformation). The Q-ST has been designed for measurements on such unstable substrates when it is not possible to level the total station (when the number of adjustment points is small (4-6 points)). Such situation occurs, among others, when measuring before the offshore duties or during the jack up or semi-submersible rig move. The presented calculation model is characterized by zero deviations at the adjustment points (at four common points). The transformation concerns the conversion of points between two orthogonal and inclined reference frames. The method enables the independent calculation of the scale factor, rotation matrix and system translation. Scaling is performed first in real space, and then both systems are shifted to the centroid, which is the center of gravity. The center of gravity is determined for the fit points that meet the criterion of stability of the orthogonal transformation. Then, the rotation matrix is computed, and a translation is performed from the computational (centroid) to real space. In the applied approach, the transformation parameters, scaling, rotation and translation, are determined independently, and the least squares method is applied independently at each stage of the calculations. The method has been verified in laboratory conditions as well as in real conditions. The results were compared to other known methods of coordinate transformation. The proposed approach is a development of the idea of transformation by similarity based on centroids.",,,,,,,,,6,0,0,0,0,0,6,,,,1424-8220,,,,,,,,,,"Maritime Univ Szczecin, Fac Nav, PL-70500 Szczecin, West Pomerania, PolandiSurvey, Westhill AB32 6FL, EnglandGeometr Ltd, PL-71525 Szczecin, Poland",iSurveyGeometr Ltd,,,2021-01-12,WOS:000594580600001,33203050,

Evolution of shoreline position is determined by the balance between erosion and accretion along the coast. In the case of salt marshes, erosion along the water boundary causes a loss of ecosystem services, such as habitat provision, carbon storage, and wave attenuation. In terms of vulnerability, higher shoreline erosion rates indicate higher vulnerability. This dataset displays shoreline change rates at the Edwin B. Forsythe National Wildlife Refuge (EBFNWR), which spans over Great Bay, Little Egg Harbor, and Barnegat Bay in New Jersey, USA. Shoreline change rates are based on Smith and Terrano (2017) analysis of digital vector shorelines acquired from historic topographic sheets, aerial photography, and/or lidar using the AMBUR package (Jackson, 2010). Linear Regression Rates (LRR) of shoreline change were averaged along the shoreline of each salt marsh unit to generate this dataset. Positive and negative values indicate accretion and erosion respectively.As part of the Hurricane Sandy Science Plan, the U.S. Geological Survey is expanding National Assessment of Coastal Change Hazards and forecast products to coastal wetlands. The intent is to provide federal, state, and local managers with tools to estimate their vulnerability and ecosystem service potential. For this purpose, the response and resilience of coastal wetlands to physical factors need to be assessed in terms of the ensuing change to their vulnerability and ecosystem services.

In this paper we provide an explanation of action taken to support conservation, understanding and enjoyment of the historic environment, such as those sites that are legally protected as historic shipwreck sites, and other features that comprise the historic environment, but which are recognised and protected through other legal mechanisms e.g., military vessels and aeroplanes. It is apparent to us that when considering the management agenda for the marine environment attention is also given to archaeological material that predates tidal inundation, as well as the subsequent legacy of maritime activities. To support this approach we examine how the historic environment is defined and included in objectives, policy and law, such as the Marine and Coastal Access Act 2009, as well as other European or international programmes to promote marine policy and spatial planning. In the years since the National Heritage Act 2002, and the empowerment of English Heritage to support marine projects, we assess the production of explanatory statements and guidance to inform protection in recognition of how change may affect historic environment features. In addition, it is apparent that extensive development is now taking place further offshore (e.g., renewable power projects) and we direct attention at how English Heritage's role is affected by legally defined maritime territorial limits that dictate interpretation of what the marine environment comprises and how such limits influence regulatory controls placed on the management of cultural heritage.

Activity in CCS has continued since 2015, but the shift towards commercial utilization has altered the context for W.V. Published field experimentation, and verification with monitoring methods, has not progressed as much as was hoped. While much high-quality theoretical work has continued, especially in the area of the design of monitoring systems, an imbalance is apparent. One area where field tests have continued, and progress has been marked, is the rapid development of distributed acoustic sensing and its pairing with permanent seismic sources. Progress here has the potential to make seismic monitoring cheaper and less intrusive. Interesting proposals have been made for monitoring with pressure data, but most have not been tested. Methods of monitoring in the marine ecosystem are rapidly being adapted to the requirements of W.V. These methods are well adapted to the quantification of leakage that is mandated in some jurisdictions.

Population declines in the western North Atlantic are associated with low annual adult survival rates, but trends and vital rates of populations in the eastern North Pacific are poorly known. To address this knowledge gap, we estimated the annual apparent survival of breeding adults at two colonies off the coast of British Columbia (Rock Islets: 52'20'40 '' N, 131'14'10 '' W and Cleland Island: 49 degrees 10'17 '' N, 126 degrees 05'28 '' W), using capture-mark-recapture data collected between 2006 and 2010. Transient models received substantially more support than standard Cormack-Jolly-Seber models, suggesting that the initial capture and banding reduced burrow fidelity. The model-averaged annual apparent survival rates for both colonies were high (estimate for each colony = 0.975 +/- 0.011), compared to rates reported for colonies in the western North Atlantic (< 0.80). Capture effects reduced annual apparent survival estimates for the first year after capture by ca. 6%. Higher apparent adult survival at colonies in the eastern North Pacific may be due to lower exposure to direct and indirect anthropogenic stressors while foraging (specifically, marine oil and gas infrastructure) and reduced avian predation by gulls at breeding colonies. The high survival rates we found suggests that eastern North Pacific populations of Leach's Storm Petrels are under less stress than those in the western North Atlantic.",,,,,,,,,7,0,0,0,7,0,7,,,1018-3337,2074-1235,,,,,,,,,,"Simon Fraser Univ, Ctr Wildlife Ecol, Dept Biol Sci, 8888 Univ Dr, Burnaby, BC V5A 1S6, CanadaEnvironm & Climate Change Canada, Wildlffe Res Div, Sci & Technol Branch, 5421 Robertson Rd, Delta, BC V4K 3N2, CanadaHatfenist Environm Consulting, POB 2498, Smithers, BC V0J 2N0, Canada",Hatfenist Environm Consulting,,,2020-05-11,WOS:000528314200019,,

The basis for assessment of fatigue damage of such elements is the long-term stress cycle distribution at critical locations caused by long-term environmental loading on the system. The long-term stress cycle distribution requires global dynamic time domain analysis followed by a detailed cross sectional analysis in a spectrum of irregular sea states. Accurate evaluation of local stresses in complex cross-sections subjected to extreme and fatigue loads is very challenging. Industry standard software frameworks, such as Helica, are currently orientated towards offshore oil and gas components and do not feature the required level of accuracy to handle new and innovative dynamic cable designs. This PhD project will address the shortcomings of existing industry software tools by developing a significantly enhanced cross section modelling capability. The resulting validated analysis tools will provide higher levels of confidence when developing new installations, as well as improved efficiency in the resulting designs.

Within the United States, nearly 1 million oil or gas wells are producing hydrocarbons with various volumes of produced water. In the past, several estimates of the annual volume of produced water have been made, but none are highly accurate, nor are they current. This paper describes a study conducted by Argonne National Laboratory for the US Department of Energy (DOE) in 2009 to develop accurate estimates of produced-water volumes for 2007. The estimates were developed through contacts with regulatory-agency representatives from each of the 31 states that produce oil and gas, as well as several federal agencies that oversee onshore and offshore production on federal lands. A few states maintained detailed records of produced-water volumes, many provided estimates from underground injection records, and a few do not maintain accurate records for estimation. For those states, estimates were developed using various extrapolation methods. Where possible, the produced-water volumes are provided separately for different hydrocarbon types (i.e., crude oil, conventional gas, coalbed methane, tight-shale gas). This allows calculations of water/hydrocarbon ratios for different states and different hydrocarbon types.In addition to providing a recent accurate volume estimate, the paper discusses the ways in which the produced water is managed in the different states and in the US offshore. While much of the onshore produced water is reinjected for enhanced recovery or disposal and much of the offshore produced water is discharged to the ocean, various other methods are used also. The Argonne study and this paper provide the most-complete and -recent picture of produced-water management in the United States.",,,,,"SPE International Conference on Health, Safety, and Environment in Oil and Gas Exploration and ProductionSPE International Conference on Health, Safety, and Environment in Oil and Gas Exploration and Production","APR 12-14, 2010APR 12-14, 2010",SPESPE,"Rio de Janeiro, BRAZILRio de Janeiro, BRAZIL",33,0,0,0,15,0,45,,,1930-1855,,,,,,,,,,,"Argonne Natl Lab, Water Policy Program, Washington, DC 20024 USAArgonne Natl Lab, Div Environm Sci, Washington, DC USA",,,,2011-08-01,WOS:000293722600003,,

Operating Companies awarded acreage in the Falkland Islands First Offshore Licensing Round began exploration for oil and gas in 1996. Appropriate environmental management is an important aspect of exploration activities in any new frontier area and the Falklands Islands were no exception. Operators with drilling commitments established the Falklands Operators Sharing Agreement (FOSA), which included,in Environmental Workgroup (EWG) to take responsibility for the environmental issues associated with exploration activities.2. The EWG was established early in the exploration programme and commissioned a number of specific environmental studies relating to the offshore environment of the Islands. The data made available by this research provided a valuable input to the assessment of potential environmental impacts from the planned exploration activities. By undertaking environmental impact assessments prior to exploration activities FOSA were able to identify and adopt operational and management controls to ensure potential environmental impacts were, where possible, minimized or avoided.3. The EWG also provided the main point of contact with the regulators on environmental matters and through the Falkland Islands Exploration & Production Environmental Forum facilitated consultation with government departments such as Fisheries, and other stakeholders such as Falklands Conservation.4. The co-operative approach taken by the operators with regard to the environmental management of the exploration activities offshore the Falkland Islands is considered to have been very successful. The most obvious benefits were through the shared resources resulting in financial savings, however, other benefits have included, avoiding duplication of effort, the promoting of 'working togetherness' and a reduced burden on consultees.

Results for potentially impacted seagrass areas were compared with existing monitoring data and with control seagrass meadows located outside of the oil spill area.Seagrass meadows were not significantly affected by the oil spill. Declines in seagrass biomass and area 1 month post-spill were consistent between control and impact meadows. Eight months post-spill, seagrass density and area increased to be within historical ranges. The declines in seagrass meadows were likely attributable to natural seasonal variation and a combination of climatic and anthropogenic impacts. The lack of impact from the oil spill was due to several mitigating factors rather than a lack of toxic effects to seagrasses.

The technology involves the capture of carbon dioxide emissions from fossil fuel power stations and other point sources, compression of the CO2 into a fluid, transporting it and injecting it deep beneath the Earth's surface into depleted petroleum reservoirs and other porous formations. Once injected, the CO2 must be monitored to ensure that it is emplaced and assimilated as planned and that none leaks back to surface. A variety of methods have been deployed to monitor the CO2 storage site and many such methods have been adapted from oilfield practice. However, such methods are commonly indirect, episodic, require active signal generation and remain expensive throughout the monitoring period that may last for hundreds of years. A modelling framework was developed to concurrently simulate CO2 geostorage conditions and background cosmic-ray muon tomography, in which the potential was assessed for using variations in muon attenuation, due to changes in CO2 abundance, as a means of CO2 detection. From this, we developed a passive, continuous monitoring method for CO2 storage sites using muon tomography, the tools for which can be deployed during the active drilling phase (development) of the storage site. To do this, it was necessary to develop a muon detector that could be used in the hostile environment (saline, high temperature) of the well bore. A prototype detector has been built and tested at the 1.1 km deep Boulby potash mine on the northeast coast of England, supported by the existing STFC Boulby Underground Laboratory on the site.

The validity of this assumption is essential to management decisions because measures of growth can differ for nonmixing populations. We examined growth rates, size-at-age, and length and weight information of red snapper collected from the recreational harvests of Alabama (n=2010), Louisiana (n=1905), and Texas (n=1277) from 1999 to 2001. Ages were obtained from 5035 otolith sections and ranged from one to 45 years. Fork length, total weight, and age-frequency distributions differed significantly among all states; Texas, however, had a much higher proportion of smaller, younger fish. All red snapper showed rapid growth until about age 10 years, after which growth slowed considerably. Von Bertalanff, growth models of both mean fork length and mean total weight-at-age predicted significantly smaller fish at age from Texas, whereas no differences were found between Alabama and Louisiana models. Texas red snapper were also shown to differ significantly from both Alabama and Louisiana red snapper in regressions of mean weight at age. Demographic variation in growth rates may indicate the existence of separate management units of red snapper in the GOM.

So far such explanations have primarily addressed organizational causes and mechanisms. We argue that these models of disaster development do not adequately capture the influence of the external institutional environment that often affects an entire sector. Instead we propose institutional theory as a broader theoretical perspective that helps to understand how the institutional environment affects disaster development in organizations, and why similar disaster development patterns can persist even after they have been identified and targeted in recommendations before. This paper also provides an empirical illustration of the institutional perspective on disaster development in the offshore oil and gas industry. Our qualitative analysis shows how inadequate beliefs about major accident risk have become institutionalized in the offshore industry through occupational training practices. As such, problematic institutionalized beliefs and practices become the accepted normality across many organizations in the industry, leading to systemic shortcomings in risk management in the entire sector. Hence, we argue for the need for professionalization in occupational training in the offshore drilling industry to improve risk management.",,,,,,,,,2,0,0,0,0,0,3,,,0925-7535,1879-1042,,,,,,,,,,"Radboud Univ Nijmegen, Inst Management Res, POB 9108, NL-6500 HK Nijmegen, Netherlands",,,,2018-12-28,WOS:000449124900011,,

When fully developed, the protocol represents one possible approach to implementing the proposed PARCOM standard testing program. Only the results for the bioaccumulation potential and oil-water distribution factor are presented here. For determination of bioaccumulation potential, the High Performance Liquid Chromatography (RPLC) is recommended. Thc oil-water distribution factor can be determined by surrogate parameters as total organic carbon (TOC), UV-absorpfion or gas chromatography (GC). This factor is critical in sample preparation and evaluation of the environmental fate and effect of oilfield chemicals. Both acute and chronic toxicity should be taken into consideration for evaluation of toxicity.

Here we combine both these approaches to investigate spatial patterns in living biomass of mangrove forests in a small area of mangrove in north-west Australia. This study used LiDAR data and Landsat 8 OLI (Operational Land Imager) with allometric equations to derive mangrove height, biomass, and C stock estimates. We estimated the study site, Mangrove Bay, a semiarid site in north-western Australia, contained 70 Mg ha(-1) biomass and 45 Mg C ha(-1) organic C, with total stocks of 2417 Mg biomass and 778 Mg organic C. Using spatial statistics to identify the scale of clustering of mangrove pixels, we found that living biomass and C stock declined with increasing distance from hydrological features (creek entrance: 0-150 m; y = -0.00041x + 0.9613, R-2 = 0.96; 150 -770 m; y = -0.0008x + 1.6808, R-2 = 0.73; lagoon: y = -0.0041x + 3.7943, R-2 = 0.78). Our results illustrate a set pattern of living C distribution within the mangrove forest, and then highlight the role hydrologic features play in determining C stock distribution in the arid zone.

The TDC is designed to create an opportunity for compensation of uncertainty caused by the phase delay. Then, considering the retrieved uncertainty, H-infinity/H-2 synthesis method is used to make robust the WADC so that the controller can compensate long and continuous delays. This design is done for two hybrid renewable energy systems (HRESs) connected to a 16-machine, 68-bus power system. The first HRES includes photovoltaic and permanent magnet synchronous generator (PMSG) fields in which a super-capacitor-based energy storage system is used in the DC link in order to improve the oscillations of the injected power resulted from the variations of wind speed and solar irradiation. The second HRES includes offshore wind farm and shore wind farm with double-fed induction generator units, and also, offshore tidal farm with PMSG units. This HRES delivers its generated power to the system through a high voltage direct current (HVDC) line. The design of the damping controller is implemented based on WADC and local control on HVDC and super capacitor converter.

However, as deepwater NGH reservoirs always have restricted accessibility, harsh engineering conditions and high operation risk, their development has been considered technically and economically less viable. Worldwide field production tests have indicated that the current techniques are not able to commercially develop deepwater NGH independently. Therefore, technological revolutions for deepwater NGH development is pressing to unlock deepwater NGH's commercial potential. The purpose of this work is twofold. First, the state-of-art research on the NGH reservoirs development and extended reach wells (ERWs) technology are comprehensively reviewed. In addition to summarize the previous research achievements, the limitations and insightful suggestions are put forward for future deepwater NGH development. Second, inspired by the development of ERWs technology and its great success in maximum depletion of the offshore unconventional oil & gas reservoirs, an innovative method for unlocking the deepwater NGH's commercial potential with ERWs from shallow water is proposed. With the benefits of improving the deepwater NGH reservoirs drainage, taking full advantage of the formation geothermal heat beneath shallow water, combining depressurization with the thermal simulation technique though linking the deepwater NGH reservoirs with multiple free gas deposits in shallower water with a single wellbore, getting free of engineering and geological risks in deepwater, minimizing the cost and environmental footprint, the innovative method may promote the commercial viability of deepwater NGH development and trigger the next boom in the unconventional oil & gas development after shale gas.",,,,,,,,,23,1,0,0,0,0,24,,,1364-0321,1879-0690,,,,,,,,,,"China Univ Petr, MOE Key Lab Petr Engn, Beijing 102249, Peoples R China",,,,2020-11-17,WOS:000582927200099,,

In 2010, the Deepwater Horizon oil spill released an estimated five million barrels of crude oil into the Gulf of Mexico, significantly contaminating coastal wetlands over approximately 800 km of shoreline. We investigated microbial nitrogen cycling processes in soil from four salt marshes in Terrebonne Bay, Louisiana, USA that were either exposed or not exposed to Deepwater Horizon oil over the course of 1 year (2013-2014), 2.5-3.5 years post-spill. Specifically, we measured nitrification and denitrification potentials, nitrogen cycling functional gene abundances (nirS, bacterial and archaeal amoA), and soil physical and chemical properties. We show that variation in nitrification and denitrification potentials was independent of site oil exposure. Large year-to-year differences in springtime nitrification potentials were inversely related to plant live belowground biomass, indicating that competition for nitrogen is likely an important control on nitrification. There were positive correlations between nitrification potentials and both soil extractable nitrate concentrations and denitrification potentials, supporting the idea that denitrification is coupled with nitrification. We found no evidence that there was a long-term impact of oil exposure on salt marsh soil microbial nitrogen cycling processes and the nitrogen removal ecosystem service they provide. It is important to note, however, that these impacts could have been masked by high background variability in process rates or loss of oil exposed soil to coastal erosion.",,,,,,,,,5,0,0,0,5,0,7,,,1559-2723,1559-2731,,,,,,,,,,"Louisiana Univ Marine Consortium LUMCON, Chauvin, LA 70344 USARowan Univ, Dept Environm Sci, 201 Mullica Hill Rd, Glassboro, NJ 08028 USACorteva Agrisci, Indianapolis, IN USAConnecticut Coll, New London, CT 06320 USAMarine Biol Lab, Ecosyst Ctr, Woods Hole, MA 02543 USA",Louisiana Univ Marine Consortium LUMCONCorteva Agrisci,,,2020-05-14,WOS:000529863500013,,

This study was designed to assess the potential drawdown of CO2 directly from the atmosphere by the enhanced weathering of peridotites and basalts in seawater. Pulverized, and ball milled dunite, harzburgite and olivine basalt were reacted in artificial seawater in batch reactor systems open to the atmosphere for two months. The results demonstrate that the ball-milled dunite and harzburgite changed dramatically the chemical composition of the seawater within a few hours, inducing CO2 drawdown directly from the atmosphere and ultimately the precipitation of aragonite. In contrast, pulverized but unmilled rocks, and the ball-milled basalt, did not yield any significant changes in seawater composition during the two-month experiments. As much as 10 wt percent aragonite was precipitated during the experiment containing the finest-grained dunite. These results demonstrate that ball milling can substantially enhance the weathering rate of peridotites in marine environments, promoting the permanent storage of CO2 as environmentally benign carbonate minerals through enhanced weathering. The precipitation of Mg-silicate clay minerals, however, could reduce the efficiency of this carbon sequestration approach over longer timescales.",,,,,,,,,47,2,0,0,6,0,51,,,0883-2927,1872-9134,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Cyprus, Dept Mech & Mfg Engn, CY-1678 Nicosia, CyprusGET, CNRS, UMR 5563, Observ Midi Pyrenees, 14 Ave Edouard Belin, F-31400 Toulouse, FranceUCL, Dept Earth Sci, Gower St, London WC1E 6DT, EnglandCtr Res & Technol Hellas CERTH, CPERI, 6th Km Charilaou Thermis Rd, GR-57001 Thessaloniki, GreeceUniv Cyprus, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, CY-1678 Nicosia, CyprusUniv Cyprus, Dept Chem, Heterogeneous Catalysis Lab, CY-1678 Nicosia, CyprusUniv Iceland, Inst Earth Sci, Sturlugata 7, IS-101 Reykjavik, Iceland",,,,2018-08-22,WOS:000439018100018,,

Assessing the impacts of decommissioning strategies on fisheries and mitigation options is an essential step in the decommissioning consenting process. It is important that fisheries impact assessments employ the best available data that are capable of resolving the fine-scale spatial patterns that are known to exist in pipeline-fishing overlaps.

In 2012, the estimated HIV prevalence for adults aged 15-49 years was 0.5% and an estimated 25 000 people were living with HIV. Although reduced from previous estimates, the country's HIV prevalence remains the highest in the South Pacific region. While the faith-based and non-governmental sectors have engaged in HIV interventions since the epidemic began, until recently the corporate sector has remained on the margins of the national response. In 2008, the country's largest oil and gas producer began partnering with national and provincial health authorities, development partners and global financing institutions to contribute to the national HIV strategy and implementation plan. This article provides an overview of public-private partnerships (PPPs) and their application to public health program management, and then describes the PPP that was developed in PNG.Issues: Innovative national and local PPPs have become a core component of healthcare strategy in many countries. PPPs have many forms and their use in low-and middle-income countries has progressively demonstrated increased service outputs and health outcomes beyond what the public sector alone could achieve. A PPP in PNG has resulted in an oil and gas producer engaging in the response to HIV, including managing the country's US$46 million HIV grant from the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria.Lessons learned: Given the increasing expectations of the international community in relation to corporate responsibility and sustainability, the role of the corporate sector in countries like PNG is critical.

J,,,,,,,,,Richard Stillman,,Building a user-friendly model to advise wildlife policy and management,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Awarded Grant,Jan 01 2008,2008,"The purpose of this project is to develop a user-friendly model that can be used to predict how environmental change (for example, caused by climate change, habitat loss, land use change, harvesting by humans or habitat management) influences animal populations. The model will be developed by adding a user-friendly interface to a novel, specialist model that has to date only been used within the scientific modelling community. This existing model has been successfully applied by the research team to a wide range of European intertidal and coastal sites, and used to predict how environmental change influences the wading bird and wildfowl populations that feed in these areas, and hence advise coastal policy and management for these species. The model has been used to advise management of coastal shellfisheries to maximise profit to the shellfish industry, while ensuring that bird populations that also consume shellfish are not adversely affected. It has been used to predict the effect of habitat loss through port development, and the most effective way of mitigating the negative effects of this habitat loss through habitat creation schemes. The model has been used in the marine environment to predict the relative impact of offshore windfarms on populations of diving ducks, and identify the developments that have the minimum effect on wildlife. Although the existing model has successfully advised coastal policy and management, it has had the major drawback that due to the technical difficulties of running the model and understanding its output, it has only been used by specialist modellers within the scientific community. This is unsatisfactory, as this tool should really be accessible to those who have a direct interest in coastal management and policy. For example, shellfishery regulators collect data on the abundance of shellfish from which they need to set quotas for the amount of shellfish that can be removed, whilst leaving enough to ensure the survival of co-dependent bird populations, and could do this in-house with a suitable model. Likewise, the model could be used by developers to compare the ecological impacts of alternative port construction sites, or by conservation agencies to assess the relative impact of development schemes to prioritise which, if any, schemes to object to. This project will provide such a user-friendly and accessible software tool. The new model will reduce the complexities of running the current model to a sequence of simple steps to develop a model for a system and define the required outputs. The new user-friendly model will be developed and tested for coastal birds, collaboratively between the research team and project partners from a range of conservation, government and industrial organisations, with an interest in predicting the effect of environmental change on coastal birds, and with whom the research team have worked successfully in the past. The new software, and associated user guide, will be developed, by an iterative processes of development, followed by testing by the project partners, a strategy designed to ensure that the partners have a full involvement in the project, and ultimately obtain the tool they require. Although, during the project, the user-friendly model will be applied to coastal birds, it will be constructed in a general way, such that it is not restricted to these systems, and can be applied to a wider range of systems in the future. These priority systems will be identified during the project. A workshop and scientific paper will be used as a platform to advertise the existence of the new model as a tool for addressing environmental conflicts both within the coast and the additional priority systems. Additionally, to allow the model to be distributed as widely as possible, and to ensure that updates can be made available after the end of the project, a website will be constructed, from which the model and updates can be freely downloaded.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,NE/F009305/1,,,,,,,,Bournemouth University,,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:15344896,,

Engagement of community members in recovery efforts is important for mitigating adverse effects of disasters and accelerating the rebuilding process for impacted communities; however, few studies have explored factors that determine participation in oil spill cleanups.Methods: We analyzed data from the Gulf States Population Survey (GSPS) to study the determinants of participating in the Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill cleanup. The GSPS was a random-digit dialing survey conducted on 38,361 adults in counties and parishes in Alabama, Florida, Louisiana, and Mississippi impacted by the oil spill. Using survey estimation to account for the complex survey design, we estimated the probability of cleanup participation and used logistic regression to examine the association between sociodemographic factors and cleanup participation.Results: Approximately 4.7% of residents in affected Gulf communities participated in the cleanup. Most participants were young, men, non-Hispanic white, and employed. Living in an affected coastal county was associated with higher odds of participation (unadjusted odds ratio [OR]: 1.69; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.28-2.24), as was having excellent or very good physical health (OR: 2.05; 95% CI: 1.11-3.81).

They are an integral part of the Critical Zone that regulates the conditions at the Earths surface and helps sustain life. Coastal marshes provide crucial services such as carbon storage and removal of nutrients and contaminants that would otherwise make their way to the ocean. Rising sea level is expanding these environments, but salt-water is also moving in, destroying woodlands, and damaging farm fields. Ghost forests and salt-damaged farm fields are stark indicators of these ecological changes along world coastlines that can adversely affect land use and economies. Less apparent, and perhaps even more important, are the concurrent changes in water and chemical cycling that are altering the functioning of the coastal Critical Zone. This research project will quantify the processes that occur in the changing coastal Critical Zone and associated alterations in cycling, fluxes, and storage of elements at the land-sea margin. The project will address important questions about how sea-level rise may alter the natural plumbing that occurs at the land-sea boundary and its implications with respect to coastal ecosystems. The results will assist decision-makers and stakeholders in planning for future environmental changes. <br/><br/>This project will quantify the coupled processes and feedbacks that govern the hydrological, ecological, geomorphological, and biogeochemical transformations in the coastal Critical Zone and how rising sea level will translate to changes in cycling, fluxes, and storage of elements at the land-sea margin. Sea-level rise pushes salt and inundation fronts inland via storms and tides (fast processes) while gradually elevating the water table (slow processes). The complexity of the system, with its strong hydrologic transience (e.g. tides, storms), tightly coupled ecosystem and biogeochemical mosaics, and human influences, make functioning and response at the marsh-upland transition difficult to characterize and predict. The governing hypotheses of this project address (1) the major fast and slow hydrological drivers of coastal Critical-Zone transition, (2) the landscape feedbacks in which ecological change drives geomorphological evolution that feeds back into hydrological and biogeochemical processes, and (3) biogeochemical feedbacks in which salinization and redox shifts alter cycling, mobility, and sequestration of nutrients and carbon. These processes differ between areas where the marsh abuts forested uplands versus agricultural land. The hypotheses will be addressed through interdisciplinary field observations, experiments, and modeling that are fully integrated across three locations along the mid-Atlantic coast with paired marsh-forest and marsh-agriculture sites. The forested and agricultural sites at each location represent major differences in hydrology, geochemistry, and ecology, and are expected to respond differently to rising sea level. This project addresses pressing needs to determine how landscapes in the coastal Critical Zone may respond to sea-level rise and how Critical-Zone research can be applied to developing policies and actions to mitigate the effects.<br/><br/>This project is jointly funded by the Critical Zone Collaborative Network, the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR), and Hydrologic Sciences.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,2012484,,,,,,,,University of DelawareUniversity of DelawareUniversity of DelawareUniversity of DelawareUniversity of Delaware,,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:15132771,,

Human factors analysis is rooted in the concept that humans make errors, and the frequency and consequences of these errors are related to work environment, work culture, and procedures. This can be accounted for in the design of equipment, structures, processes, and procedures. As stress increases, the likelihood of human error also increases. Offshore installations are among the harshest and most stressful work environments in the world. The consequences of human error in an offshore emergency can be severe.A method has been developed to evaluate the risk of human error during offshore emergency musters. Obtaining empirical data was a difficult process, and often little information could be drawn from it. This was especially an issue in determining the consequences of failure to complete muster steps. Based on consequences from past incidents in the offshore industry and probabilities of human error, the level of risk and its tolerability are determined. Using the ARAMIS (accidental risk assessment methodology for industries) approach to safety barrier analysis, a protocol for choosing and evaluating safety measures to reduce and re-assess the risk was developed. The method is assessed using a case study, the Ocean Odyssey incident, to determine its effectiveness. The results of the methodology agree with the analysis of survivor experiences of the Ocean Odyssey incident. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

The connection is not simple, not a single gap in a 'wall', but rather composed of the intricate patterns of passages and seas of varied dimensions. The velocity and temperature/salinity profiles Indonesian throughflow (ITF) are altered en route from the Pacific into the Indian Ocean by sea air buoyancy and momentum fluxes, as well as diapycnal mixing due to topographic boundary effects and dissipation of tidal energy. The INSTANT program measured the ITF in key channels from 2004 to 2006, providing the first simultaneous view of the main ITF pathways. The along-channel speeds vary markedly with passage: the Makassar and Timor flow is relatively steady in comparison to the seasonal and intraseasonal fluctuations observed in Lombok and Ombai Straits. The flow through Lifamatola Passage is strongly bottom intensified, defining the overflow into the deep Indonesian basins to the south. The 3-year mean ITF transport recorded by INSTANT into the Indian Ocean is 15 X 10(6) m(3)/s, about 30% greater than the values of non-simultaneous measurements made prior to 2000. The INSTANT 3-year mean inflow transport is nearly 13 x 10(6) m(3)/s. The 2 x 10(6) m(3)/s difference between INSTANT measured inflow and outflow is attributed to unresolved surface layer transport in Lifamatola Passage and other channels, such as Karimata Strait. Introducing inflow within the upper 200 m to zero the water column net convergence still requires upwelling within the intervening seas, notably the Banda Sea. A layer of minimum upwelling near 600 m separates upwelling within the thermocline from a deep water upwelling pattern driven by the deep overflow in Lifamatola Passage. For a steady state condition upwelling thermocline water is off-set by a 3-year mean sea to air heat flux of 80 W/m(2) (after taking into account the shoaling of thermocline isotherms between the inflow and outflow portals), which agrees with the climatic value based on bulk formulae sea-air flux calculations, as well as transport weighted temperature of the inflow and outflow water. The INSTANT data reveals interannual fluctuations, with greater upwelling and sea to air heat flux in 2006. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Then, FE modelling on double-V groove is performed for a systematic parametric residual stress analysis of the riser components with consideration of parameters including the ratio of component radius to wall thickness (r/t), joint preparation, pass size, and heat input. Through the use of a residual stress decomposition technique, the thickness-through-thickness residual stress is partitioned into membrane and bending stresses.

Wetlands provide various ecosystem services, and conservation efforts are being made to restore wetlands and their functions, including soil carbon storage. This Mid-Atlantic Regional USDA Wetland Conservation Effects Assessment Project study was conducted to evaluate the effects and effectiveness of wetland conservation practices along the Mid-Atlantic Coastal Plain. This study examined 48 wetland sites in Delaware, Maryland, Virginia, and North Carolina under natural, prior converted cropland, and 5- to 10-yr post wetland restoration states. The North Carolina sites mainly contained soils dominated by organic soil materials and therefore were analyzed separately from the rest of the sites, which primarily contained mineral soils. Soil samples were collected using the bulk density core method by horizon to a depth of 1 m and were analyzed for percent carbon. The natural wetlands were found to have significantly greater carbon stocks (21.5 +/- 5.2 kg C m(-2)) than prior converted croplands (7.95 +/- 1.93 kg C m(-2); p < 0.01) and restored wetlands (4.82 +/- 1.13 kg C m(-2); p < 0.001). The restored and prior converted sites did not differ significantly, possibly the result of the methods used to restore the wetlands, and the relatively young age of the restored sites. Wetlands were either restored by plugging drainage structures, with minimal surface disturbance, or by scraping the surface (i.e., excavation) to increase hydroperiod. Sites restored with the scraping technique had significantly lower carbon stocks (2.70 +/- 0.38 kg C m(-2)) than those restored by passive techniques (6.06 +/- 1.50 kg C m(-2); p = 0.09).

At these depths, the flexible pipes must withstand high axial loads and severe dynamic loadings generated by currents, waves and vessel motions. Moreover, the constraints generated by the dynamic loadings are often combined to corrosion issues linked to the presence of CO2 and H2S. In case of sour service application, the structural layers of a classical flexible pipe require the use of steel with reduced mechanical properties compared to a sweet service application. The combination of UDW and sour service applications consequently lead to a riser design of considerable top tension.The main challenges of such applications are the suspended weight and the fatigue / corrosion performances.Carbon fiber composite have demonstrated high specific strength and outstanding corrosion and fatigue damage resistance. The use of carbon fiber composite instead of conventional steel for the tensile armour layers of flexible pipes represents a great alternative for the development of UDW applications combined with sour service conditions.Technip has been engaged for a number of years in the development and qualification program of Carbon Fiber Composite (CFC) Armour. In 2011, an important step has been passed with the successful realization of a full-scale tension-flexion dynamic test.The program of the full-scale dynamic test is based on a representative Brazilian offshore project, a typical UDW application. The CFC prototype structure was designed considering a 9 '' gas export riser installed at a water depth of 2140m, in free hanging configuration. The riser is made of 2 parts: a top riser with CFC armours and a bottom riser with steel armours.1.8 millions of cycles were performed without damage, combining internal pressure, tensile loading and bending cycling. The whole test was monitored by acoustic emission to detect the potential damage of the CFC armours.After explaining the advantages of CFC structures compared to traditional steel structures, the paper will focus on the realization of the full-scale dynamic test program. It will detail the design and manufacture of the prototype structure, the construction of the test program representative of the offshore conditions first and then extended to more severe loadings. The paper will also present fatigue analysis and the construction of the CFC fatigue curves.",,,,,"31st ASME International Conference on Ocean, Offshore and Arctic Engineering31st ASME International Conference on Ocean, Offshore and Arctic Engineering","JUL 01-06, 2012JUL 01-06, 2012","Petrobras; ASME, Ocean Offshore & Arct Engn DivPetrobras; ASME, Ocean Offshore & Arct Engn Div","Rio de Janeiro, BRAZILRio de Janeiro, BRAZIL",3,1,0,0,0,0,3,,,,,978-0-7918-4490-8,,,,,,,,,"Technip, Le Trait, France",Technip,,,2013-11-05,WOS:000324565500013,,

Two important possibilities arise from using the proposed technology. The first possibility allows the integration with conventional thermal cycles to improve efficiency. This approach can be used to leverage efficiencies of thermal systems that have already reached a plateau in the maximum achievable efficiency via design and operation optimization. The second possibility is related to the incorporation of low temperature cycles to recover waste heat from other thermal processes. This is important considering that waste heat accounts for more than 60% of the consumed energy in the United States.

Szczecin, Poland, ISSN 0749-0208.Wetlands, including mangroves, perform diverse functions, besides the production of goods and services on an ecosystem and landscape scale. The combination of functions, goods and ecological services has a fundamental importance for society. The study of physiographic types is intended to help in dealing with and understanding the function of a complex system. Complex systems are those that share four attributes: diversity of constituents, interdependence between parts, connectedness and adaptation. This study was carried out in the Cananeia region, located in the southern coast of the Sao Paulo State (25 S), Brazil. Data from the 1980's to 2009 on the structural development of mangrove forests of two physiographic types, fringe and basin, were analyzed to discern patterns of spatial and structural organization. The fringe forests studied in the region presented a predominance of Rhizophora mangle and high structural development due to the high inundation frequency in depositionally stable sites. Fringe forests, located in progradation areas with low tidal energy, were dominated by Laguncularia racemosa with low structural development. The basin forests are dominated by R. mangle or L. racemosa, presenting reduced structural development in function of the lower inundation frequency, a predominantly sandy substrate and low salinity. But some basin forests dominated by Avicennia schaueriana were better developed reflecting the growth characteristic of this species. The results shown here highlight the large variations in the quality and intensity of forcing functions and the structural and functional diversity allowed by the plasticity of the species involved and their capacity to interact and adjust to the environment in which they develop.",,,,,11th International Coastal Symposium (ICS)11th International Coastal Symposium (ICS),"MAY 09-13, 2011MAY 09-13, 2011","Univ Szczecin, Inst Marine & Coastal Sci; Coastal Educ & Res Fdn; Univ Szczecinski (US); Cztowiek Nauka Srodowisko (CNS); ZMGM; Reg Dyrekcja Ochrony Srodowiska; Esri; Springer; Lotos; GA2 Syst; World Sci; Helmholtz-Zentrum Geesthacht; Nfosigm; Urzad Marszalkowski Wojewodztwa Zachodniopomorskiego; Wojewodzki Fundusz Ochrony Srodowiska I Gospodarki Wodnej W GdanskuUniv Szczecin, Inst Marine & Coastal Sci; Coastal Educ & Res Fdn; Univ Szczecinski (US); Cztowiek Nauka Srodowisko (CNS); ZMGM; Reg Dyrekcja Ochrony Srodowiska; Esri; Springer; Lotos; GA2 Syst; World Sci; Helmholtz-Zentrum Geesthacht; Nfosigm; Urzad Marszalkowski Wojewodztwa Zachodniopomorskiego; Wojewodzki Fundusz Ochrony Srodowiska I Gospodarki Wodnej W Gdansku","Szczecin, POLANDSzczecin, POLAND",26,0,0,0,10,7,27,,,0749-0208,1551-5036,,,,,,,,,,"Natl Inst Space Res INPE, BR-12227010 Sao Jose Dos Campos, SP, BrazilInst BiomaBrasil IBB, BR-52041050 Recife, PE, BrazilUniv Libre Bruxelles, B-1050 Brussels, BelgiumUniv Pernambuco UPE, BR-52041050 Recife, PE, BrazilUniv Fed Reconcavo Bahia, BR-44380000 Cruz das Almas, BA, BrazilUniv Paulista UNIP, BR-05347020 Sao Paulo, BrazilUS Fish & Wildlife Serv, Arlington, VA 22203 USAVrije Univ Brussels, B-1050 Brussels, Belgium",Inst BiomaBrasil IBB,,,2011-01-01,WOS:000302824900072,,

Evidence is derived from documentary sources and field studies with detailed data from Kilwa, Tanzania. Physical conditions are relatively benign, but threats are identified in adverse weather events, erosion, and sedimentation processes. Knowledge of past climatic impacts upon shipping is restricted by limited research of the off-shore environment. On-shore, the archaeological record provides evidence of protective construction work, possibly where erosion precipitated by removal of mangroves. However, unless significant port investments required safeguarding, relocation of landing area and settlement was principal response to erosion and sedimentation. Current threats to archaeology are far more significant both from natural processes of marine erosion and vegetation growth encouraged by urban decline and neglect.

Therefore, oil spills near shore can cause various adverse effects on coastal ecosystems. However, most toxicological assessments conducted on oil spill sites have focused on limited modes of toxic actions. In the present study, we utilized the Escherichia coli (E. coli) live cell array system (LCA) to identify novel modes of toxicities of the oil spill-affected sediments. For this purpose, sediment samples were collected from an area heavily polluted by Hebei Spirit oil spill (HSOS) incident of 2007. A total of 93 E. coli reporter genes were used to study responses to the chemicals in the mixture. E. coli 1(12 strains were exposed to extracts of oil or the sediment, and changes in gene expression were measured. Exposure to extracts of crude and weathered oil resulted in decreased expression in similar to 30% of tested genes. However, changes in expression observed after exposure to sediment extracts varied. Sediment extracts containing large concentrations of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) caused down-regulation of >70% of the genes, while extracts containing lesser total concentrations of PAHs exhibited different trends: genes involved in drug resistance were generally up-regulated, while genes responsive to DNA damage were up-regulated in only two extracts. Results suggest that oil pollution can modulate several toxic response pathways related to DNA repair and antibiotic responses.

Refractory carbon (slowly decomposed) may be the most important in terms of long-term sequestration and is widely referred to in models of carbon storage; however, little information exists about the quantity and variability of refractory carbon accumulation in marshes. In this study, total (CT), labile (CL) and refractory (CR) organic carbon accumulation rates were measured for Spartina alterniflora-dominated marshes representing different geomorphological settings with a range of vertical accretion rates. Three 50-cm long cores were collected in each of three marshes in Barnegat Bay and three marshes in Delaware Estuary, USA. Rates of C accumulation were calculated using Cesium-137 dating and the relative stability of soil organic carbon was quantified using acid-hydrolysis. CT accumulation ranged over fourfold among marshes from 72 to 346 g m(-2) yr(-1). CT and CL accumulation increased with increasing mineral sediment accumulation, while CR accumulation was uniform across cores averaging 78 5 g m(-2) yr(-1). Similar rates of CR accumulation across marsh areas with different accretion and mineral sediment accumulation rates was associated with a decline in the CR:Ci. density ratio as mineral volume increased. Our results suggest that carbon accumulation is higher in salt marshes with higher mineral sedimentation due, primarily, to the burial of labile carbon, and that there is a limit on the rate of chemically recalcitrant carbon accumulation in marsh soils.

The Guangzhou Marine Geological Survey (GMGS) of the Chinese Ministry of Land and Resources targeted mud diapirs and deployed gas hydrate drilling in the Shenhu area. Although an obvious bottomsimulating reflection (BSR) was detected below borehole number SH5, no gas hydrates were found at this borehole. Scientists encountered several contradictions when they analyzed the formation mechanism of hydrates related to mud diapirs. It was important to resolve this problem by sophisticated detection and thermodynamic analysis. In this study, we analyzed the thermodynamic mechanism of mud diapirs and their relationship to the occurrence of gas hydrates based on seismic profiles, mineral identification, sediment thermal conductivity measurements, and other available datasets. Our study concludes that gas hydrates were not detected at SH5 because a mud diapir pierced into the gas hydrate stability zone, leading to the decomposition of hydrates. The evolution of a mud diapir could be divided into three stages with a continuous geological process that controlled the accumulation of gas hydrates. The seismic profile and lithologic analysis showed that the mud diapir below SH5 was in the late stage of mud diapir evolution. The gas leakage system of the mud diapir was evident in the seismic profile, and the typical V-AMP (velocity-amplitude anomaly) structure displayed free gas accumulation under the BSR. The anaerobic oxidation of leaking methane promoted the formation of authigenic carbonate minerals. Thus, the deep layer of SH5 contained a relatively high percentage of carbonates and had a low thermal conductivity. In this stage, higher-temperature liquid migrated into the gas hydrate stability zone. The in situ temperature measured in this borehole was higher than the critical temperature of hydrate formation and decomposition. The liquid changed the temperature field of the region and altered the geothermal environment of hydrate accumulation, which led to the dissociation of hydrates.",,,,,,,,,30,8,0,0,1,0,38,,,0920-4105,1873-4715,,,,,,,,,,"Sun Yat Sen Univ, Sch Marine Sci, Guangdong Prov Key Lab Marine Resources & Coastal, Key Lab Offshore Oil Explorat & Dev Guangdong Hig, Guangzhou 510006, Guangdong, Peoples R ChinaMinist Land & Resources, Guangzhou Marine Geol Survey, Guangzhou 510075, Guangdong, Peoples R ChinaTexas A&M Univ, Dept Geol & Geophys, College Stn, TX 77843 USA",,,,2017-11-19,WOS:000414179100034,,

The service life of marine assets is heavily influenced by the involvement of numerous material degradation processes (such as fatigue cracking, corrosion and pitting) as well as environmental stresses that vary with geographic locations and climatic factors. The composition of seawater constituents (e. g. dissolved oxygen, salinity, temperature content, etc.) is one of the major influencing factors in degradation of marine assets. Improving the efficiency and effectiveness of maintenance management strategies can have a significant impact on operational availability and reliability of marine assets. Many research studies have been conducted over the past few decades to predict the degradation behaviour of marine structures operating under different environmental conditions. The utilisation of structural degradation data - particularly on marine corrosion - can be very useful in developing a reliable, risk-free and cost-effective maintenance strategy. This paper presents an overview of the state-of-the-art and future trends in asset maintenance management strategies applied to corroded steel structures in extreme marine environments. The corrosion prediction models as well as industry best practices on maintenance of marine steel structures are extensively reviewed and analysed. Furthermore, some applications of advanced technologies such as computerized maintenance management system (CMMS), artificial intelligence (AI) and Bayesian network (BN) are discussed. Our review reveals that there are significant variations in corrosion behaviour of marine steel structures and their industrial maintenance practices from one climatic condition to another.

Complex social and ecological processes drive vegetation cover in cities, leading to heterogeneity in C dynamics depending on regional climate, land use, and land cover. Recent work has demonstrated homogenization in ecological processes within human-dominated landscapes (the urban convergence hypothesis) in soils and biotic communities. However, a lack of information on vegetation in arid land cities has hindered an understanding of potential C storage and NPP convergence across a diversity of ecosystem types. We estimated C storage and NPP of trees and shrubs for six different land-use types in the arid metropolis of Phoenix, Arizona, USA, and compared those results to native desert ecosystems, as well as other urban and natural systems around the world. Results from Phoenix do not support the convergence hypothesis. In particular, C storage in urban trees and shrubs was 42% of that found in desert vegetation, while NPP was only 20% of the total NPP estimated for comparable natural ecosystems. Furthermore, the overall estimates of C storage and NPP associated with urban trees in the CAP ecosystem were much lower (8-63%) than the other cities included in this analysis. We also found that C storage (175.25-388.94g/m(2)) and NPP (8.07-15.99gm(-2).yr(-1)) were dominated by trees in the urban residential land uses, while in the desert, shrubs were the primary source for pools (183.65g/m(2)) and fluxes (6.51gm(-2).yr(-1)). These results indicate a trade-off between shrubs and trees in arid ecosystems, with shrubs playing a major role in overall C storage and NPP in deserts and trees serving as the dominant C pool in cities.

ACAES moderately increases environmental impacts across all assessed impact categories, and impacts are sensitive to the required capacity of the thermal energy storage.

As yet no simulations of oil drift have been undertaken in the assessment area. The vulnerability and conservational values arrived at here are based on the methods described by Anker-Nilssen (1987). 88 bird populations were assessed for the seasons: spring, summer, autumn and winter Of the 88 populations, a total of 64 were classified as highly or partially vulnerable in relation to oil spills. Of the 25 populations defined for the spring, 21 were classified as highly vulnerable. The most vulnerable populations were Common Eider, King Eider and Fulmar. Of the 28 populations defined for the summer season, 22 were classified as highly vulnerable. Ranking highest were the Common Eider, King Eider, Brent Goose populations, and next vulnerable were the Barnacle Goose and some auk species. Of the 26 populations defined for the autumn, 15 were classified as highly vulnerable. For the winter only 9 populations were considered, of which 6 were classified as highly vulnerable. The same 88 populations considered for vulnerability were also assessed to determine their conservational value. 13 populations were defined as having national conservational value, and 43 were defined as having international conservational value. As many of the populations considered are arctic species with limited distributions in the North Atlantic area, it is natural that these receive international protection value classification. The existing data basis was sufficient for carrying out a vulnerability assessment for most of the populations considered in this study. For the future effect analysis, however, more precise descriptions of the distribution and population size of some populations are needed. This especially applies to some rare and vulnerable species such as the King Eider and Brent Goose. Lack of suitable registration methods accounts for the inadequate knowledge of some populations, for example the Little Auk. The projects proposed in this report will provide a more substantial data basis for the final impact analysis of seabirds/oil in the northern Barents Sea area: (1) the registration of breeding and moulting geese and ducks in the Liefdefjorden-Moffen area, (2) the development of census methods for the Little Auk, and (3) the distribution of seabirds in open sea in the breeding period and in ice-covered waters in the spring.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,,0,0,0,,,0373-5605,,,,,,,,,,,"Natur -og Miljoundersokelser, Seljasen, Libru, 4800 Arendal, Norway",,,,1993-01-01,BCI:BCI199598279332,,

The five most important characteristic events found during maintenance and configuration processes were flaws in the tubing for A-annulus communication, leakage in the closed position, external leakage, failure to close on demand, and hydraulic failures that cause safety loss. The results provide unique insights into how offshore enterprise operators can improve maintainability management and decision-making performance using a data-driven decision strategy perspective. Furthermore, it provides a solution for visual proactive maintenance management and decision making under a data-driven framework, making it easier to implement maintenance management and decision-making tasks.

However, a secondary GSE reportedly remains even after compensation by the Al-normalization procedure, particularly for the concentrations of transition metals (C-T.M). This secondary effect also occurred in the C-(Li,C- Cs)/C-Al ratios of the Korean coastal sediments examined in this study. The primary and secondary GSEs on Cs and Li concentrations can be explained by the quartz-dilution effect and the Cs- and Li-incorporation effect of phyllosilicate minerals, respectively, based on a model involving three component end-members: a Cs and Li-free sand-dominated sediment component consisting mostly of quartz and feldspar, a Cs- and Li bearing silt-dominated component of mica, and a Cs- and Li-enriched clay-dominated component of illite. Although the primary and secondary GSEs on the concentrations of transition metals (particularly Cu and Ni) in coastal sediments might be normalized by dividing the metal concentrations by the square of the Al concentration (C-T.M/(C-Al)(2)), the GSEs can also be normalized by dividing the concentrations by the exact Cs (or Li) concentration (C-T.M/C-Cs).

J,,,,,,,,,Kelly Redeker,,Do realignment sites restore microbial biodiversity-driven nutrient cycling and trace gas fluxes comparable to natural coastal ecosystems?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Awarded Grant,Jan 16 2014,2014,"Realigned salt marshes (restored salt marshes on previously developed land) play a substantial and growing role in coastal management practices within the UK. These managed ecosystems have different above- and below-ground biodiversity and community structures, relative to their natural salt marsh counterparts, which leads to differences in ecosystem processes. Saltmarshes play a large role in global climate, nutrient cycling and regional biodiversity, especially given their relatively small area (<0.1%of the planet's surface). They are purported to be significant carbon sinks, although upper marshes can be substantial sources of methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O). Saltmarshes may therefore have multiple, potentially conflicting, effects upon global warming through greenhouse gas fluxes. Saltmarsh communities also affect climate by producing significant amounts of halogenated, nitrogen- and sulphur-bearing compounds, which affect ozone in the lower atmosphere and the stratosphere as well as acting as aerosol precursors. The biological and abiotic drivers of these climate-influencing processes within natural saltmarshes remain poorly understood and/or quantified. This lack of knowledge reduces our capacity to effectively model future climate, nor can we accurately assess the implications of various feedback mechanisms (e.g. global warming on saltmarsh carbon storage potential) upon these processes. All of the questions that arise regarding ecosystem services, biodiversity and connectivity in natural systems remain for modified-by-human systems and, at this time, are generally less quantified and more poorly understood. Our prior research has found plant and microbial community compositional differences between natural and realigned sites. A generally accepted, compelling explanation for these differences does not exist although recent evidence suggests that it is likely to be driven by physical and chemical differences in local sediments, which are in turn driven by physical processes. These changes in biodiversity are likely to lead to functional changes between natural and realigned sites; for instance below-ground biodiversity appears to be affected by nutrient (over)supply within inundation waters as well as aboveground plant community and root structure. Conversely, below-ground communities can directly and indirectly affect aboveground biodiversity by their effect on carbon storage, nutrient cycling rates, and their release of a number of climate affecting trace gases (CH4, N2O, halocarbons and sulfur-bearing compounds).Quantifying ecosystem services for future climate projections will therefore be maximally effective only when combined with an understanding of the drivers of biodiversity, community composition, and succession in natural versus realigned saltmarshes. We therefore propose to quantify trace gas fluxes from a chronology of realigned saltmarshes, with comparisons to local, natural counterparts. Our connection to currently established BESS saltmarsh study sites means that we do not duplicate research priorities unnecessarily yet we expand the intent of the original proposal into an important sub-category of coastal communities that are, as of yet, poorly quantified or understood.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,NE/K01546X/1,,,,,,,,University of York,University of York,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:15386610,,

The ichnological signatures of deltaic successions reflect these physicochemical stresses, such as rapid sediment influx, elevated water turbidity, periodically reduced oxygenation, salinity fluctuations, and wave- and tidal-energy. In the Campanian La Anita Formation of the Austral-Magallanes Basin, two examples of deltaic successions, each showing different relative dominance of wave and fluvial processes, are described in detail, allowing the recognition of contrasting stresses that acted differentially in a wave-dominated, fluvial-influenced delta and a fluvial-dominated delta. Variations in the burrowing intensity and ichnodiversity allowed us to discriminate the different physico-chemical stresses.In the wave-dominated, fluvial-influenced deltaic deposits, the alternation between fair-weather waves and storm events acted as the main controlling factor on benthic fauna in the facies of the prodelta and distal delta front, displaying facies-crossing and horizontal elements attributable to the Skolithos and Cruziana Ichnofacies, such as Arenicolites isp., Chondrites isp., Cylindrichnus isp., Diplocraterion isp., Gyrochorte isp., Ophiomorpha isp., Palaeophycus isp., Planolites isp., Rhizocorallium isp., Rossellia isp., Schaubcylindrichnus isp. and Skolithos isp. Water turbidity and periodically reduced bottom water oxygenation conditions also played an important but subordinate role. The proximal delta front, and distributary and terminal distributary channel deposits show low burrowing intensities and ichnodiversities with structures attributable to the depauperate Skolithos Ichnofacies with few Diplocraterion isp., Gordia isp., Lockeia isp., Macaronichnus isp., Ophiomorpha isp., Schaubcylindrichnus coronus and Siphonichnus isp., showing stress conditions associated with rapid sediment influx, high energy and reduced salinity conditions related to fluvial discharges as the most important controlling factors. Periodically, fluctuations in salinity conditions due to river discharges and channel avulsion may have also played important roles.The fluvial-dominated deltaic deposits show that the controlling factors were associated with fluvial discharge and river-sediment influx with no clear influence of wave or tidal action. The fades of the distal delta front were controlled by episodic sedimentation, elevated water turbidity, periodically reduced oxygenation and salinity fluctuations, the associated trace fossil suite consists of a monospecific assemblage of Ophiomorpha isp. and sparse Palaeophycus isp. The proximal delta front and the distributary channel deposits are mostly unburrowed, locally displaying a few Arenicolites isp., Lockeia isp., Ophiomorpha isp., Psilonichnus isp. and Teredolites isp. The development of these suites was controlled mainly by heightened sedimentation rates influx triggered by high fluvial discharges, elevated water turbidity due to heightened suspended load and buoyant plumes, periodic fluctuations in salinity conditions caused by river discharges and channel avulsion. Interdistributary areas are characterized by facies preserving evidence that reduced oxygenation was the most important controlling factor in this subenvironment.Fluvial processes generate the most extreme stressful conditions for benthic colonization by tracemakers. Wave processes tend to buffer the stresses produced by river discharge. The effect of waves on fluvial stress is reflected in the higher bioturbation intensities and ichnodiversities that the wave-dominated deltaic deposits of the La Anita Formation delta show in relation to the fluvial-dominated ones.",,,,,,,,,21,2,0,0,8,0,23,,,0264-8172,1873-4073,,,,,,,,,,"UNLP Ctr Invest Geol, CONICET, Diagonal 113 275,B1904DPK, La Plata, ArgentinaUniv Nacl La Plata, Catedra Sedimentol, Fac Ciencias Nat & Museo, Calle 122 & 60 S-N, RA-1900 La Plata, Buenos Aires, ArgentinaCENPAT Inst Patagon Geol & Paleontol, CONICET, Blvd Brown 2915, RA-9120 Puerto Madryn, Chubut, ArgentinaYPF Tecnol RA, CONICET, Ave Petroleo S-N Entre 129 & 143, Berisso, Buenos Aires, ArgentinaUniv Nacl La Plata, Catedra Micromorfol Suelos, Fac Ciencias Nat & Museo, Calle 122 & 60 S-N, RA-1900 La Plata, Buenos Aires, ArgentinaUniv Nacl La Plata, Catedra Rocas Sedimentarias, Fac Ciencias Nat & Museo, Calle 122 & 60 S-N, RA-1900 La Plata, Buenos Aires, Argentina",,,,2020-05-14,WOS:000514747800021,,

We used laboratory experiments to determine how water-column exposure to produced water (= the aqueous fraction of oil and gas production that is typically discharged into coastal waters) influences the colonization potential of giant kelp (Macrocystis pyrifera) zoospores on the bottom. Zoospores were maintained in suspension at relatively low densities in 18-liter containers and exposed to one of five concentrations of produced water for varying amounts of time. Zoospore swimming generally decreased with increasing produced-water concentration and exposure duration; however, the specific pattern of decrease differed between experimental trials done on different dates. The effect of exposure duration on the ability of swimming zoospores to attach to plastic dishes placed on the bottom varied with produced-water concentration. Zoospores placed in produced-water concentrations of 1 and 10% showed a steady decline in their ability to attach with increased exposure; lower concentrations of produced water had no such effects. The percentage of zoospores that germinated after attachment varied tremendously with exposure duration and date of experimental trial. Zoospores that settled during the first 12 h after release had very poor rates of germination, indicative of a short precompetent period. Surprisingly, exposure of suspended zoospores to high concentrations of produced water during the first 12 h reduced this precompetent period and greatly improved germination success on the bottom. The magnitude of this enhancement, however, varied among dates. The results suggest that adverse effects of discharging produced water on planktonic zoospores of giant kelp would most likely be limited to the immediate vicinity of the outfall.",,,,,,,,,8,0,1,0,7,0,9,,,0025-3162,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1994-05-01,WOS:A1994NP59900016,,

For most marine organisms, there is little or no information available on the toxicity of hydrocarbons or any chemical in the deep-sea. Although technical developments have reduced or removed discharges with hydrocarbons and other potentially damaging chemicals by transport to land or re-injection, accidental leaks and spills may occur. Moreover, we may benefit from knowledge-based options for assessing mitigation alternatives and for considering how much an effluent must be cleaned before it possibly can be discharged. Preliminary studies have indicated that high pressure may alter the partitioning of some hydrocarbons between oil, organisms, and water and hence influence effects in biota. Special adaptations in organisms to deep-sea life may possibly also make them vulnerable to industrial activities. It is thus uncertain to what extent knowledge gained in shallow water can be directly transferred to deep-sea environment for risk assessment and environmental monitoring. Recent environmental law regulations emphasize the importance of biological effects.

Mottled Zone Complex/Complexes (MZC/MZCs) consist of brecciated carbonate and low-temperature calcium-hydro-silicate rocks, which include unusual high- and ultra-high-temperature low-pressure (HT-LP) metamorphic mineral assemblages. The MZ has been regarded as a product of combustion of bituminous chalks of the Ghareb Fm. of Cretaceous (Maastrichtian) age. In this paper we present detailed geographic, geomorphologic, structural and geological data from the MZCs of the South Levant, which show that the MZCs cannot be stratigraphically correlated with the Ghareb Fm., because MZC late Oligocene-late Pleistocene deposits occur within or unconformably, i.e., with stratigraphic hiatus, overlap both the late Cretaceous and, in places, Neogene stratigraphic units. We propose an alternative model for the formation of MZCs by tectonically induced mud volcanism during late Oligocene-late Pleistocene time. This model explains (i) the presence of dikes and tube-like bodies, which consist of brecciated exotic clastic material derived from stratigraphically and hypsometrically lower horizons; (ii) mineral assemblages of sanidinite facies metamorphism; (iii) multi-stage character of HT-LP pyrometamorphism; and (iv) multi-stage low-temperature hydrothermal alteration. High temperatures (up to 1500 degrees C) mineral assemblages resulted from combustion of hydrocarbon gases of mud volcanoes. Mud volcanism was spatially and structurally related to neotectonic folds and deformation zones formed in response to opening of the Red Sea rift and propagation of the Levantine Transform Fault. Our model may significantly change the prospects for oil-and-gas deposits in the region. (C) 2013, China University of Geosciences (Beijing) and Peking University.

Facilities design challenges and opportunities. with particular focus on flow assurance, were considered.As oil and gas field development progresses further offshore into deeper water, facilities design and flow assurance issues become more challenging. In this harsh environment region, colder sea temperatures exacerbate common flow assurance issues such as wax and hydrate management in the subsea production system whilst the presence of floating icebergs and packed ice in the region imposes additional design challenges on surface and subsea production facilities. With increasing water depth, system operability such as hydraulic flow instability in the riser becomes more of a concern, as multiphase production has to be transported from wellbore to surface facilities. The ability to secure subsea production lines from hydrate formation risks using controlled depressurisation to the minimum pressure is more difficult in ultra-deepwater fields and may require special or focussed hydrate mitigation procedures.This paper presents work undertaken by Petro-Canada's East Coast Engineering and Technology Group to support exploration and production activities for offshore Newfoundland and covers the following areas:Brief review of development concepts for the Grand Banks harsh environment;Review of potential field expansions and add-ons in Grand Banks environment with focus in flow assurance;Review of potential deepwater development field concepts for offshore Newfoundland; andReview of challenges and potential solutions to overcome flow assurance issues in deepwater and ultra-deepwater harsh environment areas.",,,,,14th International Offshore and Polar Engineering Conference (ISOPE 2004)14th International Offshore and Polar Engineering Conference (ISOPE 2004),"MAY 23-28, 2004MAY 23-28, 2004",Int Soc Offshore & Polar EngineersInt Soc Offshore & Polar Engineers,"Toulon, FRANCEToulon, FRANCE",2,0,0,0,0,0,2,,,1098-6189,,1-880653-62-1,,,,,,,,,"Petr Canada E Coast, Engn & Technol, St Johns, NF, Canada",Petr Canada E Coast,,,2004-01-01,WOS:000223780000079,,

During this period, we observed three major sediment gravity flows, all characterized by sudden increases in current velocity that lasted 2-5 h and by downward particle fluxes. Each gravity flow, described using a high frequency current meter and two Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler (75 and 300 kHz ADCP) showed distinctive features. The first event, triggered during a flood of the Var River, was determined to be a hyperpycnal current with a large vertical extent (>100 m high) and relatively low velocity (40 cm s(-1)). The second event, observed after a Var River flood, was more energetic with a maximum horizontal current peak of 60 cm s(-1) with a low vertical extent (30 m high). This event was considered to be a turbidity landslide. The third was the result of a local canyon wall failure. It was characterized by a speed of >85 cm s(-1). These peaks of current speed were associated with large clouds of material that transported sediment along the canyon and reached up to 200 g m(-2) d(-1) of sediment (>1 g m(-2) d(-1) of organic carbon). Our measurements in the Var canyon show the important role of gravity flows transporting particulate matter to the deep-sea floor. These large inputs of sediment and organic carbon may have a significant impact on deep-sea carbon storage in the Mediterranean Sea. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

BHM is a unified probabilistic modeling approach that updates uncertain distributional knowledge about process models and parameters in the presence of multi-platform observations. Summary measures of the resulting posterior distributions provide realistic quantitative estimates of central tendencies and uncertainties. The investigators will develop our process model distributions after the North Pacific Ecosystem Model for Understanding Regional Oceanography (NEMURO). So, a significant outcome of the research will be quantitative understanding and comparisons of the relative uncertainties of NEMURO state variables and parameters, region-by-region across the North Pacific. A three-step BHM development plan will address pan-regional syntheses, climate change impacts, and ecosystem management tool concepts, over a three-year schedule. The initial BHM development will be a relocatable, time-dependent, one-dimensional (vertical) model intended to summarize ecosystem dynamics for different regimes (shelf, slope, upwelling loci, boundary current extensions, etc.) within the coastal regions of interest. Data and insights from multi-disciplinary observational programs and deterministic model implementations in coastal regions of the North Pacific will be fully exploited. In addition to emphasizing field observations, the BHM methodology will incorporate deterministic model output (e.g. the Regional Ocean Modeling System or ROMS) as data, providing a rigorous and complete synthesis of the state of understanding for coastal ocean ecosystems of the North Pacific. The investigators will focus on data and models in the Eastern Pacific from parts of the US GLOBEC program (i.e. California Current System, CCS; and Coastal Gulf of Alaska, CGOA) and in the Western Pacific (WPAC) from the North Pacific Marine Science Organization (PICES). The 1D BHM will also be implemented in climate-scale calculations to document and compare climate change impacts within and across North Pacific coastal ocean ecosystems, and to quantify uncertainties in these comparisons. The ultimate BHM implementation will be in three dimensions, accounting for mesoscale ocean dynamical impacts on the coastal ecosystem regions, and demonstrating potential ecosystem management advantages of the BHM approach. The intellectual merit of this research derives from a novel extension of probabilistic modeling methods (i.e. BHM) to synthesize disparate observations and deterministic model simulations from coastal regions on eastern and western boundaries of a major ocean basin. Application of BHM in Biological Oceanography represents a transformative research step and introduces a new paradigm. The research proposed here combines the strengths of deterministic and probabilistic models to obtain uncertainty estimates for state variables and parameters of a modern lower-trophic level ocean ecosystem model. A broader impact of the research will be the training of postdoctoral and graduate students (in statistics and oceanography) in this new synergy of ocean modeling approaches. As ecosystem managers and scientists learn to utilize state and parameter information in probability distributions, uncertain parts of the ecosystem model can be targeted for more intensive observations and/or more sophisticated parameterizations.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,814749,,,,,,,,University of California-Santa Cruz,,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:13671280,,

This study examines an industrial ROV, where the investigations include modeling of a real industrial prototype, which is then linearized and used for Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) development. The results are validated both based on non-linear model simulations. Furthermore, the LQR controller is compared with the existing built-in heading and depth PID controllers, where it is shown that the LQR controller both gives an improved closed-loop transient performance and rejects noise better than the built-in controller. It is concluded that the ROV prototype has an acceptable physical design but that the automation could potentially be improved by adding a MIMO control scheme such as the proposed LQR controller.

Two procedures were employed. The first tracked changes, in a GIS environment, in the location of eight, easily identified objects on the surface of the deposit (large boulders, topographic lobes, and the foundations of an old hut). The second used DEMs of Difference (DoDs) based on Digital Elevation Models from a 2011 LiDAR flight and two UAV flights in 2016 and 2018 obtained by Structure from Motion-Photogrammetry techniques. While the first procedure provided estimates for earthflow movement over a 62-year period, the second produced more precise data for periods of up to 8-years. The first procedure indicated that the mean rate of movement was 0.48 m.yr(-1), increasing from only 0.14 m.yr(-1) from 1956 to 1983 to between 0.50 and 0.83 m.yr(-1) from 1983 to 2018. Despite some temporal and spatial changes in direction, rates of surface movement were quite uniform on the deposit. The increase in earthflow movement after 1983 may be related to an increase in rainfall, although human activities associated with the removal of a wrecked ship from the nearshore may have been a contributing factor. The role of debuttressing due to the wave-induced removal of lateral support from the toe of the deposit is less clear. While there was no clear relationship between wave erosion and rates of movement, coastal retreat may have triggered changes in the direction and sediment flux in the toe of the deposit. This effect could have been tempered by negative feedback, however, whereby coastal erosion and increased flow activity were countered by the protection afforded by the accumulation of large, dislodged boulders on the beach. Because of this feedback, it is difficult to predict the impact of sea level rise and other elements of climate change along this coast.",,,,,,,,,15,1,0,0,1,0,15,,,0341-8162,1872-6887,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Santiago de Compostela, Dept Geog, Galicia, SpainUniv Santiago de Compostela, Lab Environm Technol, Inst Technol Res, Galicia, SpainUniv Lleida, Dept Environm & Soil Sci DMACS, Catalunya, SpainUniv Windsor, Dept Earth & Environm Sci, Windsor, ON, Canada",,,,2019-05-27,WOS:000466999700026,,

Exploration and development drilling is currently ongoing or planned in locations such as West of Shetland, offshore Eastern Canada, along Ireland's Atlantic margin, in the South Atlantic Ocean and offshore South Africa. All these locations are characterized by the challenges of deepwater, powerful ocean currents and high seas.With the lower oil price environment, carrying out drilling operations at these locations both safely and economically requires the adoption of new digital technologies and associated processes that maximize efficiency and reduce the cost of well programs. A significant aspect of this relates to planning and execution of operations involving the marine drilling riser, which can be a major contributor to non-productive time in deepwater and harsh environment locations. This paper describes a holistic approach to addressing this challenge, which covers every phase of riser operations for the drilling program, from pre-operations global riser analysis through to post-operations assessment.The paper focuses on the technology that enables this holistic solution, with emphasis on the state-of-the-art riser management technology that is deployed on the drilling vessel. This uses an advanced finite element model of the riser, BOP stack, wellhead, conductor, casing and soil interaction as well as a detailed model of the riser tensioning system. The same model is used in both the pre-operations global drilling riser analysis phase and the operational drilling phase to ensure consistency.Incorporation of the model provides the capability to perform forecast analysis on-board the rig, allowing offshore personnel to simulate a range of operations hours and days in advance using forecast metocean conditions, thereby assessing the feasibility of critical well construction operations before they commence. Capabilities for real-time monitoring of ongoing operations, fusing sensor data with the riser model, are also described. These provide calculation of live watch circles and operating envelopes for connected-mode operations, in addition to tracking of riser joint, wellhead, conductor and casing fatigue from both wave and VIV excitation. Additionally, calibration of soil models often a critical input to well head fatigue analyses can be performed.Application of the technology is illustrated by means of a case study describing deployment on a record-breaking well in a harsh environment location.

Converter stations enable the conversion from alternating to direct current, more efficiently bringing generated wind energy to shore. Out of the project process phases e.g. planning, engineering, fabrication, transport, installation and commissioning; transportation and installation are two of the most demanding during offshore platform projects. The weight and size of an offshore platform require specialized equipment, vessels and marine contractors' expertise to be transported and installed. The risks associated with transportation and installation (T&I) operations are related to health, safety and environment, and T&I operations are also sensitive to any disturbance e.g. accidents and delays. Many interdependencies between disciplines in the project execution process may result in consequential and immediate impact, should an activity not follow the plan and thus the risk of cost overruns increases. In an attempt to circumvent risks related to heavy lifts offshore and consequently mitigate the corresponding risks, a new platform concept has been developed a Norwegian EPC -company and a Swiss converter station manufacturer, a semi-submersible gravity based hybrid, SSGBH.

This approach uses Bayesian and joint probability theories to develop a predictive failure model for a given process. As a process proceeds and generates incidents and accident precursors, the accident occurrence probability is predicted.This paper presents a methodology based on the concept of dynamic failure assessment and its use in revising the risk profile for a process system based on accident precursor data modeling. An event tree is formed for a given abnormal event. Subsequently, using accident precursor data from the facility prior and posterior failure probabilities of events are calculated.

Thus, questions remain in regard to how other factors influence CO2(aq) effects on submerged vegetation. This study factorially manipulated CO2(aq) and nutrient availability, in situ, within a subtropical seagrass bed for 350days, and examined treatment effects on leaf productivity, shoot density, above- and belowground biomass, nutrient content, carbohydrate storage, and sediment organic carbon (C-org). Clear, open-top chambers were used to replicate CO2(aq) forecasts for the year 2100, whereas nutrient availability was manipulated via sediment amendments of nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) fertilizer. We provide modest evidence of a CO2 effect, which increased seagrass aboveground biomass. CO2(aq) enrichment had no effect on nutrient content, carbohydrate storage, or sediment C-org content. Nutrient addition increased leaf productivity and leaf N content, however did not alter above- or belowground biomass, shoot density, carbohydrate storage, or C-org content.

These plants use large quantities of water for various process streams. The combined wastewater effluents from the LNG plants are discharged to the coastal and marine environments typically through submarine outfalls. Proper disposal of effluents from an LNG plant is essential to retain local and regional environmental values and to ensure regulatory and permit compliance for industrial effluents. Typical outfall designs involve multi-port diffuser systems where the design forms a part of the overall environmental impact assessment for the plant. The design approach needs to ensure that both near-field plume dispersion and far-field effluent circulation meets the specified mixing zone criteria. This paper describes typical wastewater process streams from an LNG plant and presents a diffuser system design case study (for an undisclosed project location) in a meso-tidal coast to meet the effluent mixing zone criteria. The outfall is located in a coastal and marine ecosystem where the large tidal range and persistent surface wind govern conditions for the diffuser design.

Leaked gases migrating vertically along wellbores either collect and build a pressure at the wellhead known as sustained casing pressure (SCP) or escape into the atmosphere as surface casing vent flow (SCVF). SCP and SCVF are valuable indicators of integrity loss that provide insight into the potential for groundwater contamination through gas migration. Previous models of SCP and SCVF have focused on offshore wells and have not considered the relationship between SCP/SCVF and gas migration away from onshore wells. We present the first modeling framework for SCP and SCVF that is applicable to onshore oil and gas wells constructed with outermost annuli that are hydraulically connected or open to the surrounding formation. Our results show that SCP behavior is unique in onshore wells with open annuli, because steady state SCP is not achieved in an open annulus unless gas escapes the wellbore via gas migration (Darcy Flow), a wellhead leak, or a controlled bleed-off test. We show that appropriately modeling gas leakage along the wellbore and SCP/SCVF helps to constrain methane leakage fluxes from faulty wells and could be integrated with subsurface flow and transport models of stray gas contamination. By relating gas fluxes to SCP/SCVF, our model can provide information used to support regulatory actions informed by SCP/SCVF, which are easy to measure and monitor.Plain Language Summary Oil and gas wells can leak gas into groundwater if they are improperly constructed or become faulty over their lifetime. Gas contamination degrades groundwater quality and poses an explosion or asphyxiation hazard if allowed to degas in a confined space. Gas leakage in an oil and gas well can be detected easily at the surface by monitoring for undesirable pressure or gas flow at the wellhead, which are referred to as sustained casing pressure (SCP) and surface casing vent flow (SCVF), respectively. In this study, we present process-based models for SCP and SCVF, which can be used to develop a relationship between measured values and gas leakage from the well into groundwater. We demonstrate the validity of our model based on comparisons to SCP field data and illustrate its applicability for diagnosing gas leakage based on several case studies in the Wattenberg Field in Colorado. We also identify well construction practices that increase the risk of groundwater contamination and suggest better management practices for faulty oil and gas wells that will help to protect groundwater.",,,,,,,,,19,0,0,0,3,0,22,,,0043-1397,1944-7973,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Colorado, Dept Civil Environm & Architectural Engn, Boulder, CO 80309 USA",,,,2019-03-07,WOS:000459536500017,,

The sediment trap data provided information about the quantity and quality of settling material, and allowed exploration of the relationship of the sinking material with the environmental conditions in this coastal upwelling region.

The time series of C-org vertical flux was characterized by pulses of intense fluxes that were associated with peaks of primary production, generally during upwelling periods. Despite considerable variability, fluxes varied seasonally with highest values during the upwelling season and the lowest in winter. Attenuation of C-org vertical fluxes with depth (300 m vs. 1200 m) varied between 31% and 24% except for the late upwelling period, when there was an increase with depth likely due to resuspension of material from Monterey Canyon.

Both modes are usually present during sailing, while during installation phase, where the vessel is kept in a fixed position, the pumping mode is dominant and sloshing is negligible.

Turbidity currents pose a serious hazard to expensive seabed installations, especially in deeper-water settings. These sediment flows are particularly hazardous because they can be exceptionally powerful (travelling at speeds of up to 20 m/s), and can flow for long distances (100s km), causing damage over vast areas of seafloor. Even weaker flows travelling at ~1-2 m/s can severely damage seafloor equipment, or break strategically important submarine telecommunication cables, while some flows have maintained speeds in excess of 5 m/s for hundreds of kilometres. This makes hazard mitigation by local re-routing of pipelines difficult. Where seafloor topography is rugged, many operators route pipelines within canyons; however, these are focal points for turbidity current activity. Mitigating against turbidity current geohazards, particularly within canyons, can have very significant cost implications for industry - additional deepwater pipeline routing costs ~ $3 million per km. Mitigation costs of $2 billion are predicted to route pipelines under the Congo Canyon, where turbidity current hazard is deemed to be high. Perhaps just as importantly, pipeline oil spills could lead to major reputational damage. Given concern over accidents to structures used to recover oil and gas, a focus on geohazards is also aligned with NERC's environmental responsibility. The most remarkable aspect of turbidity currents is how few direct measurements there are from flows, in part because they damage monitoring equipment placed on the seafloor. Several lines of evidence point to the existence of a region of high sediment concentration at the base of turbidity currents. These dense basal layers are of key important because of: (i) their location just above the bed where most submarine infrastructure is located; and (ii) they carry most momentum due to their large density. Yet, sediment concentration has never been measured directly measured in these layers. Physical experiments, numerical modeling and ancient deposits provide valuable insights into these flows; but there is a compelling need to monitor full-scale flows in action. This project is timely because it will develop innovative field-based techniques for imaging near bed flow structure and vertical changes in sediment concentration in situ.Aims: (1) Our first aim is to develop and field test a novel technique for remote sensing of dense near bed layers. (2) Our second aim is to better understand the nature of near bed dense layers. (3) Our third aim is to embed improved understanding of dense near-bed layers into numerical models used by industry to assess impact of turbidity currents on oil and gas pipelines. (4) The project will also help to establish an international centre of excellence for submarine geohazard research at the UK National Oceanography Centre. Here we propose to make direct measurements of dense basal layers that form part of the turbidity currents occuring daily during the elevated summer river discharge on the Squamish Delta, located in Howe Sound, Canada. We will use an innovative four-point mooring to hold a vessel and suspended instrumentation payload stable above an active channel system, while we observe the dense basal layer with a Chirp sub-bottom profiler. The low frequency and broad bandwidth (1.5 -13.0 kHz) Chirp source guarantees penetration through dense near-bed layers, resolving layers with ~10 cm resolution. These field observations will help to understand the fundamental character of near bed layers, and the situations in which they form.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,NE/M007138/1,,,,,,,,National Oceanography Centre,National Oceanography Centre,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:15399197,,

Given that flooding may increase with climate change and reforestation will increase resiliency to climate change, we tested whether reforested floodplains also have great potential to store carbon and the effects of even modest increases in forested acreage on carbon storage. To calculate potential above-ground biomass in the Lower Mississippi River Alluvial Valley (LMAV) of the United States, we determined current and historical tree biomass used density estimates and diameter distributions from tree surveys and relationships between diameter and biomass from current forests. To calculate potential soil organic carbon if the landscape was forested, we used soil organic matter from soil surveys of the agricultural landscape, and multiplied the carbon by a factors of 1.25, 1.5, and 1.75 based on published reports of soil carbon increases due to afforestation. Our results showed that area-weighted mean biomass density (trees >= 12.7 cm in diameter) for historical forests was 300 Mg/ha, ranging from 228 Mg/ha to 332 Mg/ha by ecological subsection, based on the most conservative diameter distribution. Mean biomass density for current forests was 97 Mg/ha, ranging from 92 Mg/ha to 111 Mg/ha. Mean carbon density for agricultural soils was 96 Mg/ha, whereas combined tree and soil carbon densities varied from 169 Mg/ha to 317 Mg/ha; soil carbon accounted for 0.5-0.7 of total carbon density. Historical forested carbon storage in the Missouri LMAV was about 234 TgC, with the most conservative diameter distribution and assuming 80% forest coverage. Current forested carbon storage in the Missouri LMAV is about 2% of historical storage, at 5 TgC in 30,000 ha of forests, but may reach 23 TgC if forested extent almost triples, with the addition of 50,000 ha of marginal agricultural land, and carbon storage increases in trees and soil. The entire LMAV currently stores 97 TgC in forests and reasonable carbon storage for the entire LMAV may be about 335 TgC, based on increased carbon storage and reforestation of 600,000 ha of marginal agricultural land, which would double the current forested extent. Although 335 TgC storage for the LMAV is only about 1.5 times greater than historical carbon storage of the Missouri LMAV, doubling the forested extent will increase other ecosystem functions, including carbon storage, flood abatement, and reduction of fertilizer pollution in the Gulf of Mexico.

Given the changes in climate that are being experienced in response to rising [CO(2)], there is a need to understand how forest canopy processes respond to altered environments. Globally, native and managed forests represent the largest terrestrial biome and, in wood and soils, the largest terrestrial stores of carbon. Changing climates have significant implications for carbon storage in forests, as well as their water use, species diversity and management.

After the oil spill, the MIDST (Korea Institute of Ocean Science & Technology) researched PAHs (polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons) in various media, but sedimentary PAHs were not analyzed despite their longer persistency than in other media. Therefore, this study examined PAH levels in intertidal sediments around Gwangyang Bay and identified PAH sources using oil fingerprinting. PAH residual levels showed a dramatic decrease during the four months after the accident and then remained at a relatively constant level. Analysis through regression equations indicate that this study area is likely to be restored to the PAH levels prior to the accident. Furthermore, the source analysis and oil fingerprinting analysis showed that PAH contamination in this study was unlikely to have originated from the spilled oil.

Despite legislative efforts, world lead production has more than doubled since the early 1970s to 2016. Due to extensive exploitation and human activity, the coastal and estuarine regions belong to marine environments that are mostly and more rapidly deteriorated by pollutants including lead. A limited number of studies examined the effects of lead in fishes, compared to other aquatic models and even fewer studies have been dedicated to seawater fishes especially regarding Pb adsorption and accumulation in specific organs. Fish gills, key compartments involved in several crucial functions such as gas exchange, osmoregulation, and excretion, are also the organs in which Pb is mainly accumulated. Herein, we investigated the morphofunctional and ultrastructural modifications in the gills of a marine teleost (Thalassoma pavo) after acute exposure (48, 96, 192 h) to three lead concentrations. We showed that pathological alterations can be detected in all the examined samples. The most common modifications observed were: the curling of the lamellae and the dilation of their apical tips, the lamellar edema, the proliferation and the hypertrophy of CCs, the progressive epithelial disorganization with detachment of the epithelium from connective tissue. This study also demonstrates that there is a weak influence on the expression pattern of Na+/K+-ATPase and AQP3 biomarker enzymes while high metallothioneins expression has been observed. The described alterations may adversely affect gas exchange and ionic balance, with a long chain of cascading effects.

Another new approach is developed to correct for the effect of the Doppler noise on the high frequencies power spectral densities. The analysis of velocity time series combining wave and turbulent contributions demonstrates that the turbulent motions are coherent throughout the water column, rendering the wave coherence-based methods not applicable to our dataset.

Abandoned by their French crew, around 60 Madagascans were enforced to form a micro-society on this remote island for a 15-year period. Little, however, is known about the cultural and environmental adaptations the population made during their stay. This study focuses on sediment archives from Site 5, where GRAN/INRAP archaeological work in 2008 brought to light three rooms attributed to the survivor's living quarters. Particular emphasis is placed on the impacts of cyclonic storm surges, natural hazards that presented serious environmental risks to the long-term survival of the slaves. The small size of Tromelin renders it a particularly discrete unit of analysis for such a study. We have identified four chronostratigraphic units at the site. (1) Unit 4 constitutes coarse white sand incorporating rounded gravels and reworked head and branch corals. No anthropogenic material is attested. We attribute this unit to a storm layer preceding the 1761 occupation of Tromelin. (2) Unit 3 yielded a multiplicity of archaeological material and corresponds to the 18th century cultural layer. The unit varies in thickness from 10 to 40 cm. (3) Unit 2 constitutes a 20 to 40 cm sand sheet across much of Site 5 that we attribute to a powerful cyclone event. It forms an unconformable contact above unit 3 and can be divided into two distinct sub-units, 2a and 2b. Sub-unit 2a is characterised by an inverse grading of the sediments, constituting coarse sands at the base grading into rounded biogenic gravels in the upper part. This sedimentology is typical of increasing flow velocity and is diagnostic of a storm setup flow. The transition to sub-unit 2b marks the onset of the waning flow, characterised by a sharp fall in relative flow velocities. These overwash deposits buried much of the archaeological remains and have been critical to the preservation of the vestiges through to present-day. (4) Unit 1 corresponds to a layer of infill incorporating blocks of coral and cultural objects dating from the 19th to 20th centuries. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

We conducted laboratory experiments to determine the acute toxicity of Corexit 9500A, and physically and chemically dispersed Louisiana light sweet crude oil to marine microzooplankton (oligotrich ciliates, tintinnids and heterotrophic dinoflagellates). Our results indicate that Corexit 9500A is highly toxic to microzooplankton, particularly to small ciliates, and that the combination of dispersant with crude oil significantly increases the toxicity of crude oil to microzooplankton.

The objective of this article is to contribute to the improvement of corporate sustainability valuations by investigating if reserves profiles can affect the environmental risk exposure of an Oil & Gas (O&G) corporation. Data on reserves from 2009 to 2012 of 24 listed O&G companies were used to test six hypotheses, addressing how these profiles could relate to the four material environmental risks: climate change, accidents, sensitive area/access, water. The frequency with which companies reported these risks was evaluated using key word in context (KWIC) content analysis. Analysis of variance (Anova) and Student's t tests were applied to each of the hypotheses. This study shows environmental risks are embedded with the oil and gas reserves. We found the following relationships: (1) companies with heavy oil reserves report more exposure to climate change risks, particularly emissions control; (2) water is more of an issue with companies with higher bitumen and natural gas reserves; and (3) there is significant regional bias in the reporting of the environmental risk factors. These findings have broad implications for the financial industry, governments, investors and lenders alike. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

While its northern coastal area is over-populated and its sensitive and unique habitats must be protected from destruction, most of its southern coastal areas are undeveloped and deserted. Intense oil and gas exploitation activities in the Caspian Sea region and occurrence of two wars in the Persian Gulf during the last two decades have rendered hydrocarbon pollution a major issue for this country's marine and coastal environment. Biodiversity is under threat in some areas and natural resources are deteriorating. To overcome the problems, Integrated Coastal Management has been considered by Iran's government as a long-term solution.

Providing the required laws and regulations for establishing such a management body is also under way. In this paper after reviewing Iran's coastal zone characteristics and problems, the long-term goals, strategies, and policies for sustainable management of Iran's coastal areas are outlined. Then, the ICZM study procedure and its prospected outcomes are explained, and importance of some of the findings of Iran's ICM is emphasized.

After exposure to aged tailings, white sucker had smaller testes and ovaries and reduced growth compared with the source population. Fish introduced to aged unextracted oil sands material showed an increase in growth over the same period. Limited available energy, endocrine disruption, and chronic stress likely contributed to the effects observed, corresponding to elevated concentrations of naphthenic acids, aromatic compounds in bile, and increased CYP1A activity. Because of the chemical and biological complexity of these systems, direct cause-effect relationships could not be identified; however, effects were associated with naphthenic acids, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, ammonia, and high pH. Impacts on growth have not been previously observed in pelagic fishes examined in these systems, and may be related to differences in sediment interaction. Environ Toxicol Chem 2015;34:589-599.

J,,,,,,,,,Joe Cartwright,,[INSURANCE] Quantifying the risk of leakage of CO2 from subsurface storage sites,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Awarded Grant,Sep 30 2010,2010,"Rationale and Aims: Carbon capture and storage (CCS) is one of the mitigation strategies with the greatest potential to reduce global CO2 emissions this century. The UK is well placed to implement this technology because of its existing oil and gas infrastructure, and its wealth of geologically suitable storage sites. A draft EU directive on CCS sets out strict conditions for potential storage sites regarding environmental impact assessment and monitoring requirements. However, at present, there is no internationally agreed protocol to quantify the risk that once emplaced, the CO2 will leak back to the surface or pollute groundwater resources. One major obstacle to such a protocol being agreed is the limited understanding of leakage mechanisms that might occur within the sealing sequences located above the storage reservoir. By analogy, similar mechanisms that are classically invoked for leakage from oil and gas accumulations might also be expected to apply to CO2 leakage. These comprise two end members: membrane or capillary leakage and hydraulic leakage. In addition, it has recently been recognised that the sealing sequences above a reservoir might be compromised by seal bypass systems that allow large fluid fluxes to bypass the pore or fracture networks. Identification of such bypass systems is thus a key requirement for any seal risking protocol, along with physical property characterisation of the sealing lithologies themselves. Bypass systems can be identified above any potential storage sites using 3D seismic data, but are limited by the spatial resolution of the seismic method. One possible novel approach to the identification of seal bypass, is by identification of seismic amplitude anomalies that can be shown to be associated with methane in the pore space of layers within the sealing sequence. By defining the spatial distribution of these methane anomalies, it would be possible to model the likeliest flow routes taking the methane through the seal, and hence define the leakage pathways for the vertically migrating methane. In this way, the spatial analysis of methane anomalies could act as a tracer for potential CO2 leakage, and so help define the risk of leakage. The aims of this PhD research are to develop workflows and methodologies of using 3D seismic data to track potential leakage routes of CO2 through likely sealing lithologies. The main thrust of this research will be to quantify the leakage flux of methane via contrasting leakage routes to yield a relative risk-based ranking of bypass systems and other leakage mechanisms for a range of potential storage sites. The hypothesis to be tested is that seal bypass systems can be uniquely identified by their impact on methane leakage. By placing this geospatial analysis of the leakage pathways in a context of the geological history, standard risk analysis techniques used by the petroleum industry can then be applied to risk of seal failure and leakage for CO2. The development of a workflow for evidence-based risk analysis of seal failure will be generic, and should ultimately be applied more widely to the global problem of assessing the viability of CO2 storage sites. The primary method will be 3D seismic interpretation and geospatial analysis of seal bypass systems and methane-related seismic anomalies above potential CO2 storage sites. Workstation interpretation and visualisation facilities in the Royal Society/Wolfson Laboratory for CCS in Cardiff and in Statoil's CCS Research Laboratory in Trondheim will be available. Methane-related seismic anomalies will be identified through rock physics modelling (Hampson-Russell) and wireline log calibration in petroleum boreholes using standard petrophysical interpretation software in Trondheim (TerraLog). The project will mainly exploit Statoil's comprehensive seismic/well database in the North Sea, one of the primary targets for shallow CCS in Europe, and where Statoil has pioneered CCS in the Sleipner Project.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,NE/H017712/1,,,,,,,,Cardiff University,,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:15405822,,

The monitoring was carried out at the Peregrino oil field off the coast of Brazil. One sensor platform and 3 sediment traps were placed on the seabed. The sensors measured current speed and direction, turbidity, temperature, and conductivity. The sediment trap samples were used to determine suspended particulate matter that was characterized with respect to a number of chemical parameters (26 alkanes, 16 PAHs, N, C, calcium carbonate, and Ba). Data on discharges of drill cuttings and water-based drilling fluid were provided on a daily basis. The monitoring was carried out during 7 campaigns from June 2010 to October 2012, each lasting 2 to 3 months due to the capacity of the sediment traps. The data from the campaigns were preprocessed, combined, and interpreted using multivariate statistics. No systematic difference could be observed between campaigns or traps despite the fact that the first campaign was carried out before drilling, and 1 of 3 sediment traps was located in an area not expected to be influenced by the discharges. There was a strong covariation between suspended particulate matter and total N and organic C suggesting that the majority of the sediment samples had a natural and biogenic origin. Furthermore, the multivariate regression showed no correlation between discharges of drill cuttings and sediment trap or turbidity data taking current speed and direction into consideration. Because of this lack of correlation with discharges from the drilling location, a more detailed evaluation of chemical indicators providing information about origin was carried out in addition to numerical modeling of dispersion and deposition. The chemical indicators and the modeling of dispersion and deposition support the conclusions from the multivariate statistics. Integr Environ Assess Manag 2017;13:387-395.

Site selection immensely decides the success of any offshore wind power development and is a complex multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) problem. However, canonical MCDM methods tend to fail the site selection process due to the following three problems. Firstly, the compensation problem exists in information processing. Secondly, there exists the problem of incomplete utilization of decision information and information loss in the decision process. Thirdly, the interaction problem in the fuzzy environment is easy to be ignored. To deal with the above problems, this study builds a framework for offshore wind farm site selection decision utilizing Elimination et Choix Traduisant la Realite-III (ELECTRE-III) in the intuitionistic fuzzy environment. First of all, the comprehensive index system of OWPS site selection consisting of veto criteria and evaluation criteria is constructed. Then, the intuitionistic fuzzy set is used in the group decision for the decision makers to express the imperfect knowledge. Moreover, the generalized intuitionistic fuzzy ordered weighted geometric interaction averaging (GIFWGIA) operator is applied to deal with the interaction problem. Together with the likelihood-based valued comparisons, imprecise decision information is reasonably used and information loss problem is rationally avoided. Then a case of China is studied based on the proposed framework, demonstrating the site selection methodology valid and practical. This study implements evaluation method for offshore wind power site selection and also provides a theoretical basis for the development of offshore wind power decision-making in China.

This basin is about 300 km. long north-south and 170 km. wide east-west, and contains an Early Cretaceous carbonate-evaporite sequence and a Late Cretaceous and Tertiary argillaceous-arenaceous sequence. The Precambrian crystalline basement is partly covered by extrusive rocks and granite-wash type sediments. Surface and subsurface sediments of the basin consist of Lower and Upper Cretaceous, Paleocene, Eocene, and Miocene strata. Occurrences of oil and gas have been reported in almost all of the stratigraphic units in the Cuanza basin, and there is major production from the Cretaceous rocks. Study of these hydrocarbon occurrences and of the geological history of the basin shows that close relationships exist between sources, migration, and entrapment of oil, and environment of deposition controlled by the basement and salt tectonics. During Early Cretaceous time, subsidence of the central part of a restricted basin determined the regional cyclical deposition of a carbonate-evaporite sequence providing a favorable situation for genesis and entrapment of oil. Thus, the deposition during Aptian time of a very fine crystalline limestone, interbedded with argillaceous limestone and overlain by an oolitic sandy calcarenite, itself underlying evaporites, had an important influence on the subsequent extent of oil accumulations in the Binga Formation. During Aptian-Albian time, differential subsidence on the western margin of the basin caused lateral interfingering of back-reef calcarenite, argillaceous carbonate, and evaporite. This interfingering is believed to be related closely to oil accumulations in this area. Very important vertical development of reef deposits in the Longa area is related to lateral migration of the underlying Massive Salt, which flowed with the help of the excess of weight introduced by the growing reef. On the eastern margin, upper Albian reef buildups capped by marine shale also provided a favorable situation for generation and accumulation of oil. During Late Cretaceous and Tertiary time, a major basement flexure or fault zone appears to have been associated genetically downdip with deposits that accumulated with greater thickness than elsewhere. This flexure and the loci of maximum deposition moved eastward during Late Cretaceous and Paleocene, then westward during Eocene and Miocene. These thick formations, which are mainly argillaceous-arenaceous and which were deposited partly in deltaic and lagoonal environments, grade westward into thinner marine deposits and eastward into thinner continental deposits. During each particular epoch corresponding with a stabilization of this moving flexure, favorable conditions for genesis of hydrocarbons seem to be related to these transitional environments. Oil production is located above the Massive Salt at the crest of salt anticlines, and one small oil field has been discovered below the Massive Salt along a ridge of the Basement Complex in a pinch-out of sandstones between Precambrian mica-schist below, and salt above.

The two largest cities in Louisiana, New Orleans and Baton Rouge, are within the basin. Since European settlement in 1718, population increase, landscape modifications, accidental events, and exploitation of natural resources have had a profound impact on the natural landscape.A database of several hundred environmental impacts from 1718 to 2002 was developed. Examples of impacts are introduction of invasive species, extirpation of species, deforestation, dredging of wetlands, land clearing, Mississippi River modifications, oil and gas activities, the development of superfund (contamination) sites, and water pollution. The chronology was evaluated four ways to identify the most significant ecologic impacts. Based on the analyses of the chronology, five periods of anthropogenic activity are proposed to have resulted in the most significant. negative impacts to the Lake Pontchartrain Basin since European settlement in 1718. These five periods are:Land clearing and settlement of natural levees and ridges from 1718 to 1844Construction of artificial levees along the Mississippi River from 1844 to 1900Deforestation of virgin forests by commercial logging from 1890 to 1938Dredging and armoring of estuaries from 1930 to 1974Increases in water pollution from 1950 to 2002These selected activities affected approximately 76% of the area of the basin and may have reduced habitat quality by 50% initially, which later recovered to nearly 60% functionality. Generally, these impacts still result in latent impairment or increasing damage. Three of the periods contribute significantly to the wetland land-loss crisis in southeast Louisiana.The near 300-year legacy represents unsustainable land or natural resource utilization. Many of the impacts predate modern physical and biological techniques, and, therefore, a true baseline of conditions without alteration by European settlers is poorly known for the Lake Pontchartrain Basin.",,,,,,,,,9,0,0,0,6,0,13,,,0749-0208,1551-5036,,,,,,,,,,"Lake Pontchartrain Basin Fdn, 387 Carr Dr, Slidell, LA 70458 USA",Lake Pontchartrain Basin Fdn,,,2009-09-01,WOS:000209448000003,,

Placed between the existing pressure sheath and the steel layers, the anti-H2S material has the ability to neutralize H2S during its diffusion within the material. The neutralization is ensured by an irreversible chemical reaction on reactive components that are dispersed in the material. The raw material selection is based on both accurate requirements for their use in a flexible pipe and expected performances in a sour service environment over a long period of time. Some laboratory qualifications and experimental techniques are used to qualify the behavior of the material and build the material database.

Turbidite-system architecture and depositional processes were correlated with associated topographic features in order to identify zones of preferential sediment gravity-flow convergence or divergence. Zones of flow convergence facilitate flow acceleration and accumulative flow behavior, whereas zones of flow divergence facilitate deceleration and depletion. Zones of preferential flow convergence include narrow (< 2km) and steep (< 20 degrees) foredeep-margin slope channels along thrust front-segmenting tear faults, and steep, unchannelized piggyback-basin and foredeep margins (local gradients as great as 40 degrees across piggyback-basin margins). The foredeep-margin gradient is exaggerated principally by tectonic deformation that post-dates turbidite-system development, based on a paucity of growth strata. Piggyback-basin-margin gradients are exaggerated as a result of deformation synchronous with and following turbidite-system development, judging from the presence of growth strata. Slope-channel topography facilitated the development of relatively coarse-grained, amalgamated turbidite reservoirs, whereas unchannelized basin-margin topography facilitated deposition of fine-grained, chaotic non-reservoirs. Zones of preferential flow divergence are flat (< 1 degrees), unconfined (i.e., large in comparison to sediment gravity flows) piggyback-basin floors, which facilitated the development of relatively coarse-grained, non-amalgamated, upward fining turbidite reservoirs, stratigraphically partitioned by fine-grained mass transport-complex deposits. The results of this study elucidate the influence of foredeep-margin and wedge-top tectonic deformation and topography on turbidite-system and associated reservoir character and distribution across the Molasse foreland basin system in Austria, and can be applied to oil and gas exploration in analogous, structurally complex settings.

The thermophysical properties of CO2 and CO2-rich mixtures are needed as a basis for various models within CO2 capture and storage (CCS). In particular, this is true for transient models of pipes and vessels. Here, the data situation for phase equilibria, density, speed of sound, viscosity and thermal conductivity is reviewed, and property models are considered. Further, transient flow data and models for pipes are reviewed, including considerations regarding running-ductile fractures, which are essential to understand for safety. A depressurization case study based on recently published expansion-tube data is included as well. Non-equilibrium modelling of flow and phase equilibria are reviewed. Further, aspects related to the transport of CO2 by ship are considered. Many things are known about CO2 transport, e.g., that it is feasible and safe. However, if full-scale CCS were to be deployed today, conservative design and operational decisions would have to be made due to the lack of quantitative validated models. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

In this study, we have proposed CO2 capture and storage via hydrate in geological formation within the hydrate stability zone as a novel technique to contribute to global warming mitigation strategies, including carbon capture, utilization, and storage (CCUS) and to prevent vast methane release into the atmosphere caused by hydrate melting. We have attempted to enhance total gas uptake and CO2 capture efficiency in hydrate in the presence of kinetic promoters while using diluted CO2 gas (CO2-N-2 mixture). Experiments are performed using unfrozen sands within hydrate stability zone condition and in the presence of low dosage surfactant and amino acids. Hydrate formation parameters, including sub-cooling temperature, induction time, total gas uptake, and split fraction, are calculated during the single-step formation and dissociation process. The effect of sands with varying particle sizes (160-630 mu m, 1400-5000 mu m), low dosage promoter (500-3000 ppm) and CO2 concentration in feed gas (20-30 mol%) on formation kinetic parameters was investigated. Enhanced formation kinetics are observed in the presence of surfactant (1000-3000 ppm) and hydrophobic amino acids (3000 ppm) at 120 bar and 1 celcius experimental conditions. We report induction time in the range of 7-170 min and CO2 split fraction (0.60-0.90) in hydrate for 120 bar initial injection pressure. CO2 split fraction can be enhanced by reducing sand particle size or increasing the CO2 mol% in incoming feed gas at given injection pressure. This study also reports that formation kinetics in a porous medium are influenced by hydrate morphology. Hydrate morphology influences gas and water migration within sediments and controls pore space or particle surface correlation with the formation kinetics within coarse sediments. This investigation demonstrates the potential application of bio-friendly amino acids as promoters to enhance CO2 capture and storage within hydrate. Sufficient contact time at gas-liquid interface and higher CO2 separation efficiency is recorded in the presence of amino acids. The findings of this study could be useful in exploring the promoter-driven pore habitat of CO2-rich hydrates in sediments to address climate change.",,,,,,,,,15,0,0,0,0,0,15,,,,1996-1073,,,,,,,,,,"Tech Univ Denmark, Ctr Energy Resource Engn CERE, Dept Chem Engn, DK-2800 Lyngby, DenmarkTech Univ Denmark, PROSYS Res Ctr, Dept Chem & Biochem Engn, DK-2800 Lyngby, Denmark",,,,2020-11-27,WOS:000589015500001,,

In this study, the contents and pools of soil organic carbon (SOC), total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorus (TP) were quantified to investigate the invasive effects of S. alterniflora and then to evaluate whether the ecological restoration of native mangrove could reverse those effects. S. alterniflora only showed significantly higher organic carbon content in the surface 0-10 cm of soil than in the uninvaded mudflat. The high delta C-13 values in the surface soil of the invaded habitat demonstrated that S. alterniflora contributed 42.6-62.2% of the organic carbon. The SOC for invasive S. alterniflora and newly restored mangroves (4 years and 14 years) was not enhanced in comparison to the unvegetated mudflat. S. alterniflora significantly increased the surface soil TN content, but decreased the available phosphorus content and TP density. The TN densities increased gradually with the mangrove restoration, while the TP densities were only slightly influenced. The results suggested that short-term invasion of S. alterniflora and subsequent mangrove restoration did not alter SOC or TN pool sizes, but S. alterniflora was shown to affect the potential carbon storage capacity produced by the mangroves in the Zhangjiang Estuary.

In Rio Grande do Sul it occurs from coastal environments up to the plateau areas. The human actions have contributed much to the decline of populations of otters, among them we can highlight: the destruction of habitats (deforestation, construction of hydroelectric power, mining), the pollution (agriculture, oil and gas exploration, mining), hunting, intense commercial fishing and navigation. Currently these animals are considered endangered species in the vulnerable category as points the Red Book of Threatened Extinction Fauna of Rio Grande do Sul. This study recorded the occurrence areas of L. longicaudis at various points in the southwest region of Rio Grande do Sul (the Espinilho State Park, Municipal Park of Uruguaiana, the Ibirapuita Biological Reserve, Municipality of Alegrete, the Imbaa stream and the Quara river). The records were obtained by visual observation, photographic record, traces (fecal samples) and reports of local residents. Otter's feces were collected. To demarcate their rest areas and latrines L. longicaudis uses hormone mucus expelled by the anus. With this mucus individuals of the species that inhabit the same territory can distinguish the sex, if the female is receptive, if it is pregnant or with pups.

A new section on Conservation and new subsections or additional material to Social pattern and behaviour and Breeding have been added. The section on Population now gives a better picture of the population status of the Little Auk in its entire breeding range, including the Russian Arctic. However, due to the large size of colonies, hidden nesting in remote Arctic areas, and lack of suitable measurement methods, population estimates are extremely difficult. Therefore, accurate counts are lacking and population trends are unknown. The population biology of local and regional Little Auk populations (including A. a. polaris) has been the subject of several research projects during the last few years. From these, data on breeding ecology and behaviour, chick growth, and predatory pressure, which are of general interest, were extracted and are presented in new and updated sections. The same applies to the subject of feeding ecology studied in different areas. Knowledge about Little Auk diet, prey selection, food availability, energetics, and role in ecosystem has considerably improved during recent years. A new section deals with the conservation status of the Little Auk. Oil pollution close to the breeding colonies and in major wintering areas is probably the most important threat. The overall population is separated into a few core and several peripheral populations, of which especially the small southernmost populations seem to be threatened due to global warming involving changes in zooplankton distribution and availability. Wrecks probably do not affect population numbers as they have a rather local character and relatively small scale. There is still insufficient information about population status, migration routes, wintering grounds, geographic and genetic variation, including relationships between alle and polaris, demography, and behaviour, both at sea and on land, especially during the early stages of the breeding season.",,,,,,,,,68,0,0,0,63,0,72,,,1363-0601,,,,,,,,,,,"University of Gdansk, Legionow 9, 80-441, Gdansk, Poland",,,,2001-12-01,BCI:BCI200200404821,,

As a transition solution, which can be implemented on much shorter term; this study presents the technical and economic evaluation for ship-based carbon capture (SBCC) on diesel or LNG-fuelled vessels. Two reference ship engines of 1280 kW and 3000 kW were chosen. The process is simulated using Aspen Plus (R), with 30 wt% aqueous monoethanolamine (MEA) and 30 wt% aqueous piperazine (PZ) as solvents. CAPEX and OPEX were reduced by integrating the thermal energy of the exhaust gas with the stripper reboiler for the diesel and LNG powered ships. For the LNG ships, the cooling capacity from evaporation of LNG was used for liquefying the captured CO2. By using piperazine, which allows CO2 to be desorbed at higher pressure than MEA, the minimal cost of CO2 captured achieved was 98(sic)/tonne CO2 with a corresponding 1.8 million euros equipment cost for the 3000 kW engine ship. Additionally, the feasibility of SBCC is investigated by adapting an existing cargo ship design (powered by the reference 3000 kW engine) for including the carbon capture process equipment. The capture, compression and storage units are fitted onboard, and the design is modified so that the transport capacity remains the same, while maintaining the ship stability.",,,,,14th International Conference on Greenhouse Gas Control Technologies (GHGT)14th International Conference on Greenhouse Gas Control Technologies (GHGT),"OCT 21-25, 2018OCT 21-25, 2018",,"Melbourne, AUSTRALIAMelbourne, AUSTRALIA",53,2,0,0,3,0,55,,,1750-5836,1878-0148,,,,,,,,,,"TNO, Leeghwaterstr 44, NL-2628 CA Delft, NetherlandsDelft Univ Technol, Leeghwaterstr 39, NL-2628 CB Delft, NetherlandsKhalifa Univ Sci & Technol, Masdar Inst, Dept Chem Engn, POB 54224, Abu Dhabi, U Arab Emirates",,,,2019-06-01,WOS:000468197300001,,

Conventional offshore gas processing comprises water dew-point adjustment via glycol-absorption, hydrocarbon dew-point adjustment via Joule-Thomson expansion, and carbon dioxide removal via membrane-permeation. Alternative processing contemplates the use of supersonic separators for adjusting gas dew-points followed by carbon dioxide capture via membrane-permeation (so-called SS-MP scheme); or for adjusting gas dew-points and also accomplishing carbon dioxide abatement (so-called SS-SS scheme). The conventional process is environmentally and economically compared with SS-MP and SS-SS for application in offshore rigs treating raw gas (44%mol carbon dioxide) to produce exportable fuel-gas (approximate to 20%mol carbon dioxide), while dispatching carbon dioxide rich fluid (approximate to 75%mol carbon dioxide) for enhanced oil recovery in the oil-gas field. Results show that SS-MP requires 7.8% less power than the conventional process. Moreover, implementing SS-SS deepens the advantage against the conventional operation because SS-SS produces carbon dioxide rich fluid at high-pressure, requiring much less compression power for enhanced oil recovery than the low-pressure permeate from membrane-permeation. SS-SS has lowest carbon emission (-28.3%), lowest power consumption (-21.3%) and best economic performance: lowest manufacturing cost and lowest compressor investment. Thus, SS-SS is the overall best and cleanest solution, with highest 20 years net value (+860 MMUSD) and lowest environmental impact. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

The extraction of tidal energy may impact sediment dynamics in far-field environments, such as the intertidal zone, through potential alterations to tidal amplitude in the Minas Basin. Tidal conditions (e.g. current velocity, turbulence, suspended sediment concentration) were monitored in a sheltered salt marsh creek over 18 tidal cycles in various stages of the spring-neap cycle. Samples of deposited and suspended sediments were collected and analyzed for grain size using a Beckman Coulter Multisizer III. Results suggest that the flocculated component of both deposited and suspended sediment is consistently high over a wide range of tidal conditions. A routinely high incoming concentration of highly-flocculated material results in large amounts of sediment deposition in tidal creeks in response to individual tidal cycles. Resuspension and removal of newly deposited material is shown to vary with over-marsh, bankfull and channel-restricted tides. Disruption of the tidal regime due to a reduction in Minas Basin tidal amplitude may lessen the cumulative export capacity of tidal channels over time, potentially leading to gradual infilling of tidal creeks.

For this purpose, the trajectory and weathering of the similar to 18,000 tons of heavy fuel oil spilled from the Jiyeh thermal power plant were simulated along the coast of Lebanon using the 3D MEDSLIK model, supported with sea water sampling and analysis and field measurements. The base simulation of the spill under existing conditions at the time of occurrence defined the temporal distribution over 90 days of oil spilled in terms of percentage of oil on the surface or evaporated (13.1%), dispersed in the water column or landed on the coast (86.9% landed of which 30.1% were potentially releasable). The spatial distribution defined shoreline stretches with high risk of exposure (located 35 km north of the source and stretching for more than 150 km with medium to low risk exposure). Parametric analysis revealed a relatively higher sensitivity to the drift factor, the current depth, and the time of spill parameters. Deployment of booms reduced shorelines exposure by similar to 95% in comparison to baseline conditions, and medium or light brands increased evaporation by similar to 22-42% and reduced oil reaching the coast by similar to 37-57% in comparison to heavy fuel oil.

The site, at a depth of approximately 60 meters, is located near shipping lanes, a local ferry route, and a transit area for many cetacean species. A key finding is that the statistical distribution of total sound pressure levels are dependent on tidal currents at the site. Pseudosound, cobbles shifting on the sea bed, and vibrations induced by forces on the equipment are possible explanations. Non-propagating turbulent pressure fluctuations, termed pseudosound, can mask ambient noise, especially in highly energetic environments suitable for tidal energy development. A statistical method identifies periods during which changes in the mean and standard deviation of the one-third octave band sound pressure levels are statistically significant and thus suggestive of pseudosound contamination. For each deployment, recordings with depth averaged tidal currents greater than 1 m/s are found to be contaminated, and only recordings with currents below this threshold are used in the subsequent ambient noise analysis.Mean total sound pressure levels (0.156 - 30 kHz) over all recordings are 117 dB re 1 mu Pa. Total sound pressure levels exceed 100 dB re 1 mu Pa 99% of the time and exceed 135 dB re 1 mu Pa 4% of the time. Commercial shipping and ferry traffic are found to be the most significant contributors to ambient noise levels at the site, with secondary contributions from rain, wind, and marine mammal vocalizations. Post-processed data from an AIS (Automatic Identification System) receiver is used to determine the location of ships during each recording. Referencing 368 individual recordings with the distance between the ferry and the site obtained from AIS data, the source level of the ferry is estimated to be 179 +/- 4 dB re 1 mu Pa at 1m with a logarithmic spreading loss coefficient of 18.",,,,,Washington State Conference and Trade Center (WSCTC)Washington State Conference and Trade Center (WSCTC),"SEP 20-23, 2010SEP 20-23, 2010",IEEE; Marine Technol; OESIEEE; Marine Technol; OES,"Seattle, WASeattle, WA",3,0,0,0,0,0,3,,,0197-7385,,978-1-4244-4333-8,,,,,,,,,"Univ Washington, NW Natl Marine Renewable Energy Ctr, Seattle, WA 98115 USA",,,,2010-01-01,WOS:000287539100132,,

Million barrels of water are produced each day worldwide. This situation has become a major problem and a to the environment and ecosystem. Produced water contains many constituents such as dispersed oil, metals and chemicals that have a high toxicity and very harmful to the marine life. Therefore, it must be treated prior disposal to the environment or reinjection into the well and formation. There are many methods of treatments such as liquid-liquid hydrocyclone, floatation technology and membrane technology. Membrane technology is quite a new technology for the treatment of produced water in oil and gas industry. This paper is focused on the viability of using composite membranes which are Polysulfone (PSU), Polysulfone-bentonite (PSU-bentonite), PSU-PVP (Polysulfone-Poly vinyl pyrrolidone) and Polysulfone-Poly vinyl pyrrolidone-bentonite (PSU-PVP-bentonite) for the treatment of produced water. The objectives of this study are; 1) to characterize the produced water, 2) to prepare and cast the composite membrane and 3) to investigate the membrane performance in treating the produced water. The performance of the composite membrane were tested by using the produced water as wastewater feed and the best composite membrane is determined by the membrane performance. In the membrane preparation process, a method have been used namely phase inversion method. This research found that technically composite membrane have a good potential to be used in treating produced water from Malaysian oil and gas field.

Membrane filtration is one possible candidate for significantly improving separation efficiency. However, fouling is one major challenge, where contaminants accumulate within the membrane and thereby adds additional flow resistance. This paper investigates the possibility of improving reference tracking and reducing fouling by improving control pairings and actuator placement. This is achieved by investigating the interaction between commonly deployed decentralized control loops on a membrane process model. The relative input-output interactions are evaluated across varying feed flow rates and membrane flow conductances to ensure that decoupling is maintained beyond the defined operating point. This work concludes that the location of the actuators affects the degree of decoupling significantly and to achieve the maximum degree of decoupling, different actuators must be selected across a variety of operating condition.

Moreover, it is a complex structure with different types of offshore facilities and a large amount of outfitting that connects different offshore installations. In particular, an enormous amount of various piping materials is installed in a relatively narrow space, and thus, the difficulty of working is relatively high compared to working in ships or ground plants. Generally, when the 3D detailed design is completed, an offshore plant piping process is carried out at the shipyard with ISO 2D fabrication drawings and ISO 2D installation drawings. If a worker wants to understand the three-dimensional piping composition in the working area, he can only use three-dimensional viewers that provide limited functionality. As offshore plant construction progresses, correlating work with predecessors becomes more complicated and rework occurs because of frequent design changes. This viewer function makes it difficult to identify the 3D piping structure of the urgently needed part. This study deals with the process support method based on a system using a 3D simulator to improve the efficiency of the piping process. The 3D simulator is based on the Unity3D engine and can be simulated by considering the classification and priority of 3D models by the piping process in the system. Further, it makes it possible to visualize progress information of the process. In addition, the punch content can be displayed on the 3D model after the pipe inspection. Finally, in supporting the data in relation to the piping process, it is considered that 3D-simulator-supported piping installing could improve the work efficiency by more than 99% compared to the existing method.",,,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,,,1225-0767,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2021-07-07,KJD:ART002596723,,

To meet these needs, our research objectives were to characterize soil conditions supporting different vegetation units of the Lower Orinoco Plain and to relate soil characteristics with vegetation assemblages. For these purposes, surface and bottom soil samples were taken in 227 sites, which were distributed proportionally to each vegetation unit coverage. Samples were analysed for salinity, chlorides, carbonates, pH, organic carbon, exchangeable acidity, aluminium, hydrogen, calcium, potassium and sodium. Average thickness of the surface organic layer was 2.32 m, reaching 6 in in some places. Organic carbon content did not differ significantly among soils from different vegetation units. Lowest surface pH values were found in forests and meadows (< 4.5). Bottom pH was less variable and almost neutral. The highest salinity values were found in mangrove soils (1.80% +/- 0.12), the lowest in palm forests (0.06% +/- 0.02). Main differences among soil samples were related with cation exchange capacity (68.3 meq/100g +/- 81.5), percent base saturation (91.9% +/- 11.0), and acidity (2.30 meq/100g +/- 3.46).

Some experts and designers selected mixed refrigerant process for floating platform, while some recommended expander cycle. However, few of them compared the two types of processes systemically before making a choice. In this paper, the liquefaction processes of propane pre-cooled mixed refrigerant cycle (C-3/MRC), mixed refrigerant cycle (MRC) and nitrogen expander cycle (N-2 expander) for the special offshore associated gases in South China Sea have been designed and studied. These processes have been analyzed and compared systematically considering the main factors including the performance parameters, economic performance, layout, sensitivity to motion, suitability to different gas resources, safety and operability, accounting for the features of the floating production, storage and offloading unit for liquefied natural gas (LNG-FPSO) in marine environment. The results indicated that N-2 expander has higher energy consumption and poorer economic performance, while it has much more advantages than C-3/MRC and MRC for offshore application because it is simpler and more compact and thus requiring less deck area, less sensitive to LNG-FPSO motion, has better suitability for other gas resources, has higher safety and is easier to operate. Therefore, N-2 expander is the most suitable offshore liquefaction process. In addition, the exergy analysis is conducted for N-2 expander and the results indicate that the compression equipments and after coolers, expanders and LNG heat exchangers are the main contribution to the total exergy losses. The measures to decrease the losses for these equipments are then discussed. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

These features have been interpreted as resulting from a history involving three hydrocarbon injections, and the introduction of mete oric waters.The sandstone units, some containing oil and gas, dip and thicken southward toward the basin depocenter. Salinity in both irreducible water of the hydrocarbon column and pore water of the water leg increases southward. Isohalines in the hydrocarbon column are broadly parallel to those in the water leg, but water salinity in the oil column is higher than in the water leg.In the north, typical diagenetic mineral assemblages include kaolinite, siderite, pyrite, Ti-oxides, and quartz, but farther south they in elude chlorite, pyrite, albite, Ti-oxides, and quartz. Detrital feldspar and mica in the north are partly dissolved and altered to kaolinite, whereas to the south, they show chlorite alteration. The authigenic phosphate xenotime increases from north to south.The contrast in diagenetic assemblages from north to south, together with the increase southward in water salinity, point to southward how of introduced water, and siderite zonation indicates that the introduced water ranged from meteoric to saline.

It Bowed down dip, generally diluting saline con nate waters of the marine sequence as it penetrated the basin. Flow began during early diagenesis.There were at least two episodes of oil emplacement. The presence of the first oil halted most mineral diagenesis in the reservoir, and solid bitumen envelopes developed around radioactive monazite grains. As the oil leaked out, mineral diagenesis recommenced, and traces of residual oil were trapped in the growing quartz. Emplacement of the second (present) oil again halted mineral diagenesis, and a little of the new oil adhered to envelope surfaces or penetrated envelope cracks.

However, few of these have examined whether the use of an adequate representation of the stratosphere might affect simulations of the ENSO. In the present work, sea surface temperature data from two numerical model configurations, namely one with a well-resolved stratosphere, the high top configuration (Hadley Centre Global Environmental Model, HadGEM2-CCS), and the other without a well-resolved stratosphere, the low top configuration (HadGEM2-CC), are employed to study the impact of the stratosphere on the surface climate, especially on the ENSO. A pre-industrial control run is performed to eliminate interference from other factors, such as greenhouse gas warming and volcanic eruptions. Based on the present research, both model configurations function reasonably well and have shown little difference from each other when analyzng the global annual and seasonal mean sea surface temperatures, except for the Northern Atlantic Ocean region. A statistical analysis performed using the t-test method shows that the significant differences in the annual and seasonal mean sea surface temperatures in the Northern Atlantic region result from real signals rather than random noises. Furthermore, the configuration with a better representation of the stratosphere simulates the quasi-period of the ENSO and the seasonal phase-locking characteristics of El Nino more precisely. Therefore, it is probably advantageous to adopt climate models that resolved stratosphere for a more realistic representation of ENSO climatology and its possible variations under certain conditions.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,0324-6329,,,,,,,,,,,"Shaoxing Univ, Dept Math & Phys, 508 Huancheng West Rd, Shaoxing 312000, Peoples R ChinaUniv Oxford, Dept AOP Phys, Wellington Sq, Oxford OX1 2JD, EnglandNanjing Univ Aeronaut & Astronaut, Dept Astronaut, 169 Sheng Tai West Rd, Nanjing 211106, Peoples R China",,,,2020-04-01,WOS:000520188400001,,

Improved analytical techniques for S isotope analysis have recently enhanced our understanding of the mechanisms for OSC formation and maturation and their associated S isotope distributions. The close interaction of OSCs with inorganic S species throughout their formation and maturation affects their S-34/S-32 isotopic ratio (delta S-34), forming specific signatures for distinct sources and processes. Ultimately, thermal maturation homogenizes the delta S-34 values of different fractions and individual compounds. Reservoir processes such as thermochemical sulfate reduction (TSR) introduce exogenous and isotopically distinct S into hydrocarbons and can significantly change the delta S-34 of petroleum or kerogen. Specific OSCs react at different rates and thus can be used to evaluate the extent of processes such as TSR.

This analysis was based on the lithologic and petrographic studies of core samples and grain size analysis in slides. The analysis results allowed drawing the correlation pattern of the Yakovlevskaya and Nizhnehetskaya Suites of boreholes, which were studied. According to the granulometric data, the cumulative curves, the curves of differential grain size distribution and the G.F. Rozhkov's dynamogenetic alpha-t diagram were drawn. These data allowed getting straight the conditions of sedimentation of suites. The Yakovlevskaya suite was forming in the continental conditions. In the point of Vankorskaya-10 sedimentation was in the near-bottomland plots, floodplain lakes and bogs (the form of the SP curve, the low and the high hydro-dynamic regime, the abundance of carbonic recrements). Apparently, this part of the area of interest was bogged up for a long time. In the point of borehole-9 sedimentation seems to be in rivers. The abrupt change in the hydrodynamic regime, the coarse wastes, the poorly continuous (by the author's data) grain composition and also the vegetation remains prove such conditions of formation. A paleochannel of a large river with a high hydrodynamic level might have existed sometime at the studied area. During the Berriasian-Early Valanginian Time, the formation of deposits on the studied territory is supposed to take place in the coastal-marine conditions in various facies conditions -from a shallow-water maritime gulf (mainly with argillaceous-silt stones) to a littoral area (aleuropelitic sediments with lenticular sandstone strata beds). At that time aleuro-argillous littoral sediments with strata and lenses of arenaceous beds of offshore beaches, swells and swallows (the Nizhnehetskaya Suite) were mainly formed in the area of the modern near-edge zone swells and monoclines. Consequently, the productive sedimentary deposits of the Nizhnehetskaya Suite were formed within the Vankorskoe raising in the coastal-maritime conditions and in the facies conditions of alongshore sandbars and barrier islands. The productive deposits of the Yakovlevskaya Suite were formed in the continental settings and facies conditions of the side bed, the mainstream, the beach barriers. Comparing the results of the granulometric analysis and the data of the previous exploration on sedimentation conditions of the Lower Cretaceous deposits in the Vankorskoe field, it must be admitted that the most effective and more correct facies diagnostics may be achieved by combining granulometric analysis and detailed lithofacies exploration.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,1561-7793,1561-803X,,,,,,,,,,"Tomsk State Univ, Tomsk, Russia",,,,2010-09-01,WOS:000421474500048,,

Efforts to evaluate the impacts of flaring on the surrounding environment have been hampered by limited access to official information on flare locations and volumes; hence, an alternative method of acquiring such information is needed. This article describes the development and application of the Landsat Flare Detection Method (LFDM), based on the combination of the near-, shortwave, and thermal infrared bands of Landsat imagery. The technique was validated using a reference data set of flare locations interpreted from aerial photographs, achieving a user accuracy of 86.67%. The LFDM was applied to a time series of imagery (1984-2012 inclusive) to obtain a long-term flaring history of the region; 303 flares (251 onshore and 52 offshore) were detected over the study period. The spatiotemporal distribution of these flares corresponds to known variations in oil and gas activities in the region. There was considerable variation between states in the trajectories of gas-flaring activity and the proportion of onshore vs. offshore flaring, which indicates substantial spatiotemporal variations in the environmental impacts of this industry. The LFDM builds upon existing methods of flare detection, which were based on moderate-resolution imagery, by offering increased precision of flare location estimates, improved objectivity, accurate identification of onshore and offshore flares, and a long flaring history. The LFDM is an efficient and cost-effective method that can provide local- to regional-scale information, which is complementary to that derived from other remote methods of flare detection and ground-based surveys. It could thus be used for backwards (flare history) and/or forwards (monitoring) surveys, especially in monitoring the country's progress towards the recently set 30% flare reduction target by 2017.",,,,,,,,,36,1,0,0,11,0,40,,,0143-1161,1366-5901,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Lancaster, Lancaster Environm Ctr, Lancaster LA1 4YQ, England",,,,2014-06-18,WOS:000331864600017,,

Sediment collected from mangrove forest (MG) and intertidal zone (IZ) were incubated with different N rates (0 (control), 5 (low-N) and 20 (high-N) N g(-1) dry sediment, respectively). After incubation, the activities of phenol oxidase (PHO) and acid phosphatase (ACP) were enhanced, but beta-glucosidase (GLU) and N-beta-acetyl-glucosaminidase (NAG) activities were reduced by N addition. The altered enzymatic stoichiometries by N input implied that microbial phosphorus (P) limitation was increased, whereas C and N limitation were alleviated. Besides, N input decreased the bacterial abundance but increased fungal abundance in both types of sediment. The increased pH and soluble phenolics along with the exacerbated P limitation by N addition might explain these changes. Furthermore, sediment with N addition (except high-N treated MG sediment) showed a trend of C sequestration, which might be largely caused by the decrease of bacterial abundance and GLU activity. However, MG sediment with high-N suggested a trend of C loss, and the possible reason for this discrepancy might be the relatively higher increase of PHO and ACP activity. To better understand the influence of N deposition/pollution on C cycling, the long-term N effect on microorganisms, enzymes, and thus C storage should be paid more attention in the future.

Characterization of PW compositional variability is needed to evaluate environmental impact, treatment, and reuse potential. Geochemical variability of PW from Guadalupian (Middle Permian) to Ordovician formations was statistically and geostatistically evaluated in the western half of the Permian Basin (Delaware Basin, Central Basin Platform, and Northwest Shelf) using the US Geological Survey's Produced Waters Geochemical Database and the New Mexico Water and Infrastructure Data System. Mean total dissolved solids (TDS) of PW increased with depth in the Delaware Basin and Central Basin Platform to the Delaware and Wolfcamp formations (Guadalupian age). Mean TDS decreased with further increases in depth. In contrast, the mean salinity of PW was significantly higher within the shallow, younger formations (largest mean TDS in the Artesia Formation); TDS decreased with depth below Guadalupian age formations in the Northwest Shelf. Kriged contour maps of TDS and major ions illustrated spatial variability across the three geo-structural regions as a function of depth. The occurrence of meteoric waters in upper and deeper formations across the three regions was significant, and was attributed to Laramide Orogeny and Basin and Range extension uplifting and tilting effects and recent water flooding.

Development of oil and gas fields in northeastern Sakhalin, Russia, is a concern, because they overlap with WGW feeding grounds. Some WGW migrate similar to 10 000 km from feeding grounds around Sakhalin Island (Russia), to breeding grounds in Baja California (BajaC; Mexico) and possibly similar to 6000 km to the South China Sea (China). We developed a WGW female bioenergetics model to examine potential consequences of energy lost from foraging cessation caused by anthropogenic disturbance, and compared it to eastern gray whales (EGW). Energy loss was then linked to potential reductions in reproduction and survival. Mean total energy requirements were 11 and 15% greater for WGW breeding in BajaC and China, respectively, compared to EGW, due to longer migration distance (25%) to BajaC and higher metabolic rates at foraging grounds. However, this difference is minimal for EGW that use the northern extent of their foraging range. On average, WGW breeding in BajaC and China need 9 and 17% more energy for survival than EGW. Our model predicts that WGW mortality would likely occur at 38 to 40% annual energetic loss. Long-term yearly energy loss of <30% would re duce population growth due to lower reproductive rates. Ongoing yearly energy losses of >30% would result in adult female mortality the first year, followed by lower reproductive rates of survivors.

In addition, similarities between different HCLs challenge the efficiency of current improvement mechanisms and the completeness of applied risk management practices. Accident causation models sustain that different roles in different levels, including regulators, companies, and the work environment, create the necessary conditions to a loss event, and therefore should be part of the accident analysis. This paper analyzes similar HCLs occurred in Norwegian and Brazilian offshore platforms to compare the regulatory approaches to risk control, aiming to identify influences related to the recurrence of HCLs in functional regulatory regimes (FRRs). As a result, each HCL among case studies consists of human errors that occurred while offshore crews were operating unsafe systems created by improper design or changes to address operational demands. An inappropriate context may support the impairment of safeguards that may not always be available or reliable in an environment which has as particular aspects the remoteness and the need to be self-sufficient. As a consequence, unsafe systems impose safety rules to offshore personnel and more relevance to human performance in the overall risk picture. In FRRs, the combination of regulatory requirements and enforcement activities is part of the safety context and influence risk owners' behavior. The current comparison identifies differences between Brazilian and Norwegian regulatory regimes that may influence safety in offshore systems, as well as risk constraints related to human performance, which is strongly dependent on influencing factors such as safety culture.",,,,,,,,,12,0,0,0,0,0,13,,,0925-7535,1879-1042,,,,,,,,,,"Brazilian Natl Agcy Petr Nat Gas & Biofuels ANP, Rio De Janeiro, BrazilNorwegian Univ Sci & Technol NTNU, Dept Marine Technol, Trondheim, Norway",Brazilian Natl Agcy Petr Nat Gas & Biofuels ANP,,,2019-12-09,WOS:000496603900057,,

The core sediments are predominantly composed of clay and silt-sized material. Three grain size end-members (EM) as well as three sensitive grain size classes (SC) were discerned, interpreted as Ice Rafted Debris (EM1 and SC1), and coarse (EM2 and SC2) and fine (EM3, SC3) materials deposited from bottom nepheloid layers, respectively. Ratios of EM2/(EM2+EM3) and SC2/SC3 reveal changes in the local bottom current strength, which is related to the deep ocean diapycnal mixing rate, showing higher values during interglacial periods and lower values during glacial periods. MnO was enriched at each glacial termination, probably caused by abrupt elevations in Antarctic bottom water (AABW) formation rate. Lower AABW formation rate and reduced deep diapycnal mixing during glacial periods enhanced deep Southern Ocean stratification, contributing to glacial atmospheric CO2 drawdown. The elevated AABW formation and enhanced deep diapycnal mixing during glacial terminations alleviated such deep stratification, promoting deeply sequestered CO2 to outgas.Plain Language Summary The Southern Ocean is a key place to modulate atmospheric CO2 concentrations on different timescales.

Oil release continued for 87 d and much of the oil and gas remained in, or returned to, the deep sea. A coral community significantly impacted by the spill was discovered in late 2010 at 1,370 m depth. Here we describe the discovery of five previously unknown coral communities near the Macondo wellhead and show that at least two additional coral communities were impacted by the spill. Although the oil-containing flocullent material that was present on corals when the first impacted community was discovered was largely gone, a characteristic patchy covering of hydrozoans on dead portions of the skeleton allowed recognition of impacted colonies at the more recently discovered sites. One of these communities was 6 km south of the Macondo wellhead and over 90% of the corals present showed the characteristic signs of recent impact. The other community, 22 km southeast of the wellhead between 1,850 and 1,950 m depth, was more lightly impacted. However, the discovery of this site considerably extends the distance from Macondo and depth range of significant impact to benthic macro-faunal communities. We also show that most known deep-water coral communities in the Gulf of Mexico do not appear to have been acutely impacted by the spill, although two of the newly discovered communities near the wellhead apparently not impacted by the spill have been impacted by deep-sea fishing operations.",,,,,,,,,77,1,0,0,57,0,78,,,0027-8424,1091-6490,,,,,,,,,,"Penn State Univ, Dept Biol, University Pk, PA 16802 USAWoods Hole Oceanog Inst, Dept Appl Ocean Phys & Engn, Woods Hole, MA 02543 USALouisiana State Univ, Coastal Studies Inst, Dept Oceanog & Coastal Sci, Baton Rouge, LA 70803 USAUnited States Dept Interior, Bureau Ocean Energy Management, New Orleans, LA 70115 USATemple Univ, Dept Biol, Philadelphia, PA 19122 USAWoods Hole Oceanog Inst, Redfield Lab, Woods Hole, MA 02543 USATDI Brooks Int Inc, College Stn, TX 77845 USA",TDI Brooks Int Inc,,,2014-08-12,WOS:000340097900046,,

Furthermore, cleaner production and process sustainability impose sending the separated CO2 to early enhanced oil recovery, which has economic benefit but gradually increases %CO2 in raw gas, paralleled by decaying oil and gas flowrates. These conditions favor CO2 capture by membrane permeation (MP) for bulk removal and chemical absorption (CA) for polishing removal. Hybrid MP-CA has greater flexibility to face varying production and %CO2, demanding lifetime-oriented process design. CO2 production profile is estimated adopting %CO2 retained in source rock (0%, 60%) and gas flowrate predicted by empirical production decline curves. Under transient gas production MP area and operational conditions are optimized via non-linear programming at five points of process lifetime constrained by %CO2 in injected fluid above 75%mol.

IOR is achieved mainly by drilling more wells, but drilling in partially depleted reservoirs is challenging due to narrow pressure margins. Offshore drilling in harsh environments, such as the North Sea, presents additional challenges, since the heaving motion from a floating rig induces large surge and swab pressures in the well. This brief suggests a remedy for this problem using automatic control of well pressure. Taking advantage of an experimental lab facility recently completed at NTNU, a model of the drilling system is developed using subspace identification methods. The model serves as a basis for state estimation and controller design using model predictive control. Applying the controller to the lab facility, pressure oscillations are suppressed by 70%-90% compared with the open-loop case, depending on the period of the heave motion.",,,,,,,,,21,0,0,0,0,0,23,,,1063-6536,1558-0865,,,,,,,,,,"Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Engn Cybernet, N-7491 Trondheim, NorwayNorwegian Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Petr Engn & Appl Geophys, N-7491 Trondheim, NorwayStatoil Res Ctr, Dept Intelligent Well Construct, N-3910 Porsgrunn, Norway",,,,2015-04-02,WOS:000350341500039,,

This study investigated individually scale-, tidal-, equipment- and observer-induced variation through analysis of animal population density indices obtained using a number of techniques based on SCUBA diver visual survey. The study was based on shallow subtidal sites on the west coast of Scotland including natural rocky slopes and recently deployed artificial reef sites. Groups of species investigated varied in levels of size, abundance, mobility and detectability. Variability in estimated densities between different sizes of sampling unit, state of tide, type of SCUBA equipment used (open circuit versus rebreather) and observation technique was found to be considerable. A decreasing asymptotic relationship with quadrat size was evident in the majority of cases for estimated density, coefficient of variation and number of samples required to attain a given precision. However, the size of the sampling unit employed had to be large enough to encompass the variability in spatial distribution of the target organism. Improved precision for estimates of cryptic species was obtained from relatively small sampling units, which focused the observer's attention onto a specific area. Underwater photography as a population estimation technique produced data comparable with that from visual surveys but was limited by the size of sampling unit. The use of remotely deployed infra-red video demonstrated that certain animal species and life-stages actively avoid divers and were largely absent from the diver-based surveys.

The marine snow settled with oil and clay minerals as an oily sludge layer on the deep sea floor. This study tested the hypothesis that the unprecedented amount of chemical dispersants applied during high phytoplankton densities in the Gulf of Mexico induced high EPS formation. Two marine phytoplankton species (Dunaliella tertiolecta and Phaeodaclylum tricornutum) produced EPS within days when exposed to the dispersant Corexit 9500. Phytoplankton-associated bacteria were shown to be responsible for the formation. The EPS consisted of proteins and to lesser extent polysaccharides.

Specific accomplishments include evaluating and selecting a climatological data base to use for the study, establish a technique for performing the extremal analysis, and generating maps of 100-yr return period wind speeds and wave heights.Measured data from National Data Buoy Center (NDBC) and Scripps Coastal Data Information Program (CDIP) offshore stations were used to characterize the storm climate and to assess the strengths and weaknesses of two North Atlantic Ocean hindcasts. Hindcasts under consideration included the 20-yr USACE Wave Information Studies (WIS) with kinematically adjusted storm winds, and a new 30-yr WAVEWATCH III (R) hindcast using National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) Climate Forecast System Reanalysis Reforecast (CFSRR) winds. Using the latest available techniques for wave spectral partitioning, a sea and swell climatology for the region is presented. Robust error metrics quantify hindcast performance in replicating both the observed wave systems and event peak conditions. Each hindcast product was found to have specific strengths and weaknesses. Although the WIS hindcast is shown to have superior winds, the WIS and NCEP wave hindcast results are mixed. As the NCEP product is presently only available for research purposes, the WIS hindcast was selected for use in computation of the final map products.A total of four extremal analysis techniques were evaluated for assessment of extratropical wind and wave storm data. The Empirical Simulation Technique (EST) provided in [14] employs a life-cycle approach to extreme value analysis. In contrast, the Generalized Pareto Distribution (GPD) [2], Weibull [11], and Generalized Extreme Value (GEV) [22] methods are parametric extrapolations to the data. To evaluate these approaches in our area of interest, extratropical Storm populations were identified at five test stations by applying both Peak over Threshold (POT) and Annual Maximum Series (AMS) techniques (for use with the GEV) to the NCEP 30-yr hindcast which is the longest hindcast currently available. Tropical storms were removed by an automated process linked to the North Atlantic Hurricane Database (HURDAT).

The results show that the bending moment and lateral displacement of the drilling riser decrease significantly and the stress of the riser increases with increasing tension ratio. There is an increase in the lateral displacement of the drilling riser and the bending moment at the lower end of the drilling riser, with an increase in the initial offset of the offshore drilling platform.

Most of the easiest accessible offshore petroleum reservoirs have been discovered and a great part developed over the last six decades. Thus, development of new oil and gas fields faces a lot of challenges as most of them are in remote areas, in deep waters and/or in areas with extreme environments like the Arctic region. One of the major trends in the offshore petroleum industry points towards deeper waters (e.g. outside West Africa, the Brazilian Pre-Salt developments and in the Gulf of Mexico). This trend also includes increased use of subsea installations instead of platforms, more subsea processing and increased use of pipelines to transport the hydrocarbons to shore or into a pipeline grid.This paper addresses some of the challenges pipeline design, installation and operation may face in deep and ultra-deep waters. The main design challenge is related to the high external pressure that may cause collapse of the pipeline. This potential failure mode is normally dealt with by increasing the pipe wall thickness, but at ultra-deep water depths this may require a very thick walled pipe that becomes very costly, difficult to manufacture and hard to install due to its weight. One approach to overcome this is to improve some of the parameters that determine the collapse resistance by an improved manufacturing process. Other approaches are to ensure a minimum internal pressure is maintained in the pipeline during all phases, or to install a buoyant pipeline that is anchored at a moderate water depth rather that laying on the sea bed.",,,,,,,,,14,0,0,0,0,0,14,,,1475-0902,2041-3084,,,,,,,,,,"Norske Veritas, N-1322 Hovik, Norway",Norske Veritas,,,2013-11-01,WOS:000326449900007,,

Environmental performance evaluation (EPE) is an essential part of an EMS. However, previous studies on EPE indicate that existing lists of indicators little insight into how indicators are modified to more accurately assess environmental performance.In this paper, a way is proposed to identify and define specific environmental performance indicators on a case-by-case basis, which consists of five steps: (1) describing environmental requirements; (2) determining favourable outcomes corresponding to the requirements; (3) identifying required activities or issues to achieve the outcomes; (4) searching for proper measures of the activities or issues; and (5) generating a list of key indicators. Based on these steps, a quality function deployment (QFD) approach is developed to determine key indicators and evaluate environmental performance. To handle uncertainties in QFD, the decision makers' evaluations are quantified through rough numbers using the concept of rough sets. The outputs of the proposed approach are different environmental performance indices. Using these indices, decision makers can easily determine whether an improved performance has been achieved through an EMS. The proposed approach is transparent and promising for use as a unified tool for EPE. An application of the proposed approach is demonstrated through a numerical example. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

However, land subsidence caused by significant oil, gas and brine extraction, as well as sediment compaction, could exacerbate the flooding effects of sea-level rise and storm surge. In order to evaluate the coastal dam vulnerability, we combined unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) with small baseline subsets (SBAS) interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) results to generate an accurate coastal dam digital elevation model (DEM) over the next 10, 30 and 80 years. Sea-level simulation was derived from the relative sea-level rise scenarios published by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and local long-term tide gauge records. Assuming that the current rate of dam vertical deformation and sea-level rise are linear, we then generated different inundation scenarios by the superposition of DEMs and sea-levels at different periods by way of a bathtub model.

At present, the oil spill emergency response system established in China has five levels: the national level, sea level, provincial level, port level, and ship level. China has demonstrated its ability to control and remove small-scale oil spill from ships in port area and near-shore coastal waters, and also paid attention to related research and development projects.

Beginning in June 2009, ten moorings were deployed throughout the Inlet and refurbished every two to eight months. Despite challenging conditions consisting of strong tidal currents carrying debris and seasonal ice cover, 83% of mooring deployments were successfully recovered. Noise from water flow, vessel traffic, and/or industrial activities was present at several sites, potentially masking some signals. However, belugas were successfully detected at multiple locations. Detections were relatively common in the upper inlet and less common or absent at middle and lower inlet locations. Killer whale signals were also recorded.

A drifting MODU may damage other critical elements of the offshore oil and gas infrastructure by colliding with floating or fixed production systems and transportation hubs, or by rupturing pipelines owing to their dragging anchors over the seabed. To avoid or mitigate the damage caused by a drifting MODU, it is desirable to understand the mechanics of the drift of a MODU under the impact of severe wind, wave and current and have the capability of predicting the trajectory of the drift. To explore the feasibility and accuracy of predicting the trajectory of a drifting MODU based on hindcast met-ocean conditions and limited knowledge of the condition of the drifting MODU, this study employed a simplified equation describing only the horizontal (surge, sway and yaw) motions of a MODU under the impact of steady wind, current and wave forces. The simplified hydrodynamic model neglects the first- and second-order oscillatory wave forces, unsteady wind forces (owing to wind gustiness), wave drift damping, and the effects of the body oscillation on the steady wind and current forces. It was assumed that the net effects of the oscillatory forces on the steady motion are insignificant. To verify the accuracy and feasibility of our simplified approach, the predicted drifting trajectories of two MODUs were compared with the corresponding measurements recorded by the global positioning system (GPS).

Due to the harsh nature of the environment, these risers are subject to fatigue over their lifetime. It is important, as part of their integrity management, that regular in-service monitoring is undertaken to track how the asset ages. Current inspection methods for flexible risers are limited. Only radiography can inspect the multiple layers within a flexible riser to produce a volumetric inspection. Automated underwater digital radiography improves on traditional radiography by allowing a shorter inspection time. This paper presents the design and development of a new automated, underwater digital radiography inspection system prototype to survey flexible risers at depths of 100m. This is a cost effective solution using a commercially available underwater Gamma radiation source holder and a high definition, linear digital radiography detector housed in a submersible vessel. The sub-sea deployment of a linear detector for underwater inspection of flexible risers is reported for the first time. The use of a linear detector array offers greater sea depth capability, in a smaller package, and the ability to cope with the high radiation energy demands of the Gamma source compared to flat panel detector solutions. Deployment has been achieved by implementation of a bespoke robotic scanning system that can accurately control the source and detector motion.

Avoiding exposure of workers to the modules that generate high sound power during maintenance activities can significantly mitigate the noise impact on human health and safety. Noise simulation and noise mapping methodologies can be used to evaluate and quantify the noise impact on offshore platforms. However, limited digital information of offshore platforms makes noise simulation setup challenging as modules on topsides have a high level of details. In addition, current noise mapping studies are usually conducted in a 3D static manner, which only reflects noise impact at a certain time. Building information modeling (BIM) provides detailed physical and functional characteristics of a facility that can be applied to support the noise simulation on offshore platforms. In this study, attempts have been made to develop a BIM-supported 4D acoustics simulation approach to mitigating the noise impact on maintenance workers of offshore platforms. BIM is utilized to automatically provide required information to facilitate noise simulation setup. 4D acoustics simulation approach is used to obtain the spatio-temporary sound pressure level (SPL) distribution of the noise generated by the functional modules on offshore platforms. Acoustic diffusion equation (ADE) is selected as noise SPL prediction model. To evaluate noise impact on maintenance workers, an equation based on daily noise dose is then newly derived to quantify the noise impact. Optimization algorithm is used to determine the maintenance schedule with the minimum daily noise dose. Finally, optimized maintenance schedule that has considered noise impact is used to update the daily maintenance plan on offshore platforms. An example of a fixed offshore platform with maintenance daily activity information is used to illustrate the proposed BIM-supported 4D acoustics simulation approach.

The extreme weight, lower fatigue and corrosion resistance of steel risers significantly limited the exploitation depths and the production capacity. Nowadays, it is acknowledged that using fibre-reinforced polymer composites to manufacture risers can be a better option. The prototypes of composite risers fabricated and tested confirm that fibre-reinforced polymer composites have an obvious advantage over steel risers on weight saving. Three different approaches are developed here to minimise composite risers' weights: (1) enhancing the riser with only axial-direction and hoop-direction fibre; (2) off-axis reinforcements are included using an iterative approach of manual inspection and selection and (3) employing the optimisation technique of surrogate-assisted evolutionary algorithm. These design approaches have been applied to eight different material combinations to achieve the minimum structural weight by optimising their laminate configurations. The designs are conducted in accordance with the Standards, considering both local load cases and global - functional as well as environmental loads using ANSYS 15.0.

Identical monitoring studies performed in all three years have allowed the biological effects and bioaccumulation data to be compared, and in addition, enabled the potential environmental benefits of a PW treatment system (CTour), implemented in 2008, to be evaluated. The results of the 2009 survey showed that caged animals were exposed to low levels of PW components, with highest tissue concentrations in mussels located closest to the PW discharge. Mussels located approximately 1-2 km away demonstrated only background concentrations of target compounds. Concentrations of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) and alkyl phenol (AP) metabolites in the bile of caged cod were elevated at stations 200-250 m from the discharge. There was also a signal of exposure relative to discharge for the biomarkers CYP1A in fish and micronuclei in mussels. All other fish and mussel biomarkers showed no significant exposure effects in 2009. The mussel bioaccumulation data in 2009 indicated a lower exposure to the PW effluent than seen previously in 2008 and 2006, resulting in an associated general improvement in the health of the caged mussels.

For each life-cycle phase of each technology the following 4 key metrics were assessed: material consumption, energy return ratios, job requirements and greenhouse gas emissions. We also calculate a novel global electricity to grid average for these metrics and present a metric variability analysis by altering transport distance, load factors, efficiency, and fuel density per technology. This work quantitatively supports model-to-policy frameworks that drive technology selection and investment based on energetic-economic viability, job creation and carbon emission reduction of technologies. The results suggest energetic-economic infeasibility of electricity generation networks with substantial shares of: i) liquefied natural gas transport, ii) long distance transport based hard and brown coal and pipeline natural gas, and iii) low-load factor solar-photovoltaic, concentrated solar power, onshore and offshore wind.

The emphasis was not only put on net power output, but also on system size, which is a key parameter for offshore operation. To find a suitable trade-off between those two values, a cycle calculation tool was programmed which uses detailed heat exchanger models to ensure a fair comparison of the different working fluids. A subcritical propane cycle, a transcritical CO2 cycle and a transcritical cycle with a mixture of propane and ethane were analyzed. It was shown that more than 10% of the export gas compression work could be recovered.

One and a half years after this incident, a set of subtidal and intertidal marsh sediment cores were collected from five stations in Barataria Bay, Louisiana, USA, and analyzed to determine the spatial and vertical distributions and source of hydrocarbon residues based on their chemical composition. An archived core, collected before the DWH oil spill from the same area, was also analyzed to assess the pre-spill hydrocarbon distribution in the area. Analyses of aliphatic hydrocarbons, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and stable carbon isotope showed that the distribution of petroleum hydrocarbons in Barataria Bay was patchy and limited in areal extent. Significant TPH and Sigma PAH concentrations (77,399 mu g/g and 219,065 ng/g, respectively) were detected in the surface sediments of one core (i.e., core A) to a depth of 9 cm. Based on a sedimentation rate of 0.39 cm yr(-1), determined using Cs-137, the presence of anthropogenic hydrocarbons in these sediment core deposited ca. 50 to 60 years ago. The historical background hydrocarbon concentrations increased significantly at the sediment surface and can be attributed to recent inputs. Although the oil present in the bay's sediments has undergone moderate weathering, biomarker analyses performed on core A samples likely indicated the presence of hydrocarbons from the DWH oil spill. The effects of oiling events on Barataria Bay and other marsh ecosystems in this region remain uncertain, as oil undergoes weathering changes over time. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

In such joints of 316L, corrosion comparatively attacked more easily to the HAZ.

More precisely, focus is given to prediction risk indices aiming to give a comprehensive signal on the expected level of forecast uncertainty. Ensemble predictions of wind generation are used as input. A proposal for the definition of prediction risk indices is given. Such skill forecasts are based on the spread of ensemble forecasts (i.e. a set of alternative scenarios for the coming period) for a single prediction horizon or over a took-ahead period. It is shown on the test case of a Danish offshore wind farm how these prediction risk indices may be related to several levels of forecast uncertainty (and potential energy imbalances). Wind power ensemble predictions are derived from the conversion of ECMWF and NCEP ensemble forecasts of meteorological variables to wind power ensemble forecasts, as well as by a lagged average approach alternative.

We also identified institutional challenges or vulnerabilities. These include conflicting agency cultures, high financial costs, and long timeframes associated with baseline data collection.

Some previous investigations indicated that repair welding is likely to pose adverse effects on the long-term integrity of the structure exposed to high pressure and temperature actions. It is believed that high residual stresses, associated with the repair process, most probably play an important role in many of subsequent failures. Repair welds might aggravate the size, magnitude and distribution of the tensile residual stresses in the weldments. These adversely affect the component structural integrity and remaining life. So far, no generally accepted guideline is available to provide reliable evaluations on the possible side effects from the repair welding in offshore oil/gas pipelines. This paper reports the result of residual stress measurement on single/double and partial/full repair welds in offshore pipelines. The semi destructive blind hole drilling and destructive sectioning methods have been employed to measure the residual stress fields in each case. In general, the results of the two measurement methods are in reasonable agreement. Residual stresses which are caused by full and partial repairs in the studied samples slightly increased the residual stress distribution when compared to the as-welded condition.

The geomorphological characteristic of the coastal area is highly dynamic where land erosion and accretion with different rates are constant phenomena. This research focuses on three coastal zones: western, central and eastern that comprise the entire coastal area of the country. Using 'Mental Modeler' software this study quantified experts' judgements on the issue and developed FCMs by way of arranging workshops. At the basis, this study identified 33 factors of susceptibility to erosion for current baseline conditions. Considering future projections of hydro-climatic phenomena, this study accentuated potential factors of susceptibility to erosion for future scenario under three time-slices: near-future (2020), future (2050) and far-future (2080). The results generated from FCMs show that some factors such as sedimentation, soft and unconsolidated soils, shelf bathymetry, funnel shape of the Bay of Bengal, wave action, river discharge, monsoon wind, cyclone and storm surges, excessive monsoon rain, high tidal energy, variations of tidal range and sea level rise are highly influential that yielded higher centrality scores for both current and future susceptibility of the area to erosion. The experts' interpretations demonstrate that the future susceptibility to erosion might be higher in the central zone compared to the western and eastern zones of the coastal area. This is the first time that FCM based approach was applied to evaluate expert views on coastal susceptibility to erosion for the country. This study suggests coastal managers, planners and policymakers to consider the current and future factors of susceptibility of coastal lands for taking specific measures options.

The pathway to achieving the international target of 50% GHG reduction by 2050 is unclear, but numerous promising options exist. This study provides a holistic assessment of these options and their combined potential to decarbonise international shipping, from a technology, environmental and policy perspective. Liquefied natural gas (LNG) is reaching mainstream and provides 20-30% CO2 reductions whilst minimising SOx and other emissions. Costs are favourable, but GHG benefits are reduced by methane slip, which varies across engine types. Biofuels, hydrogen, nuclear and carbon capture and storage (CCS) could all decarbonise much further, but each faces significant barriers around their economics, resource potentials and public acceptability. Regarding efficiency measures, considerable fuel and GHG savings could be attained by slow-steaming, ship design changes and utilising renewable resources. There is clearly no single route and a multifaceted response is required for deep decarbonisation. The scale of this challenge is explored by estimating the combined decarbonisation potential of multiple options. Achieving 50% decarbonisation with LNG or electric propulsion would likely require 4 or more complementary efficiency measures to be applied simultaneously. Broadly, larger GHG reductions require stronger policy and may differentiate between short- and long-term approaches. With LNG being economically feasible and offering moderate environmental benefits, this may have short-term promise with minor policy intervention. Longer term, deeper decarbonisation will require strong financial incentives. Lowest-cost policy options should be fuel- or technology-agnostic, internationally applied and will require action now to ensure targets are met by 2050.",,,,,,,,,276,6,0,0,9,0,289,,,0196-8904,1879-2227,,,,,,,,,,"Imperial Coll London, Sustainable Gas Inst, London SW7 1NA, EnglandImperial Coll London, Dept Chem Engn, London SW7 2AZ, EnglandImperial Coll London, Ctr Environm Policy, London SW71 NE, EnglandE4tech, 83 Victoria St, London SW1H 0HW, EnglandImperial Coll London, Dept Earth Sci & Engn, London SW7 2BP, England",E4tech,,,2019-02-15,WOS:000458227700009,,

The immense potential to store CO2 in these rocks can only be fully achieved by the operation of more than one injection site within each formation. A UK North Sea case study anticipates the operation of two injection sites in the Captain Sandstone and assesses any interaction between the injection sites. Technical investigations to optimize the storage capacity in a regionally extensive North Sea sandstone by the operation of more than one injection site within a storage formation [1] are summarised: geological modelling; geomechanical modelling; simulation of CO2 injection; monitoring planning. The UK case study includes the Goldeneye Field, the storage site investigated for the planned Peterhead CCS project. An injection scenario was examined that comprised an initial project storing within a depleted hydrocarbon field structure followed by a second injection site within the surrounding saline aquifer. The research investigations were targeted to identify and reduce any perceived concerns specific to the operation of two sites by a risk assessment-led process. Requirements for a monitoring plan specific to a multi-user storage formation, based on the prediction of storage site perfomiance, were also developed. Generic learning applicable to any suitable multi-user storage sandstone was captured, from the process followed and the technical knowledge acquired, on the characterisation of extensive sandstone formations, management of the planned injection operations and monitoring planning.

These dramatic changes resulted in major climate science studies being conducted in the Arctic Ocean as well as opening the way for increased shipping and offshore oil and gas activities. An extended measurement record of the horizontal dimensions of this ice cover is available for the full Arctic Ocean Basin based upon a record compiled from nearly 40 years of relatively continuous satellite based measurements. Unfortunately, data accumulations for the ice cover's vertical dimension, i.e. sea ice thickness, as well as full temporal resolution ice velocity and under-ice ocean current profiles tend to be limited to a small number of year-long mooring data sets with durations that are only a few to several years, reflecting underlying greater measurement challenges. Moreover, the longest duration ice thickness data collection efforts, spanning more than 10 years, have been confined only to two specific portions of the Basin, namely, Fram Strait and the Canadian sector of the Beaufort Sea. However, in the past ten years, the available year-long ice and oceanographic mooring data sets have greatly increased in total number and in the number of sites.Advanced upward-looking sonar (ULS) instruments operated from subsurface moorings has been and continues to be the primary source of data with volumes and accuracy sufficient for meaningfully monitoring ice thickness, ice velocities, ocean current profiles and other in-situ water properties. The ice thickness, or more properly ice draft (underwater ice thickness) data is measured continuously with temporal resolution of 1 -2 seconds. Technological advances, since ULS instruments were first developed in the 1980's have led to new generations of iceprofiling sonar (IPS), incorporating much expanded on-board data storage capacities (up to 16 Gigabytes) and powerful realtime firmware which now allow unprecedented temporal (ping rates of up to 1 Hz). When combined with ULS Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler (ADCP) instrumentation using a special ice tracking mode (with a temporal resolution of a few minutes), details of the ice topography can be realized to resolutions of better than 0.1 m in the vertical and 1 m in the horizontal. These very high resolution ice draft measurements fully resolve individual ice features including undeformed level ice, brash ice, individual large ice keels including multi-year ice, hummocky ice rubble fields, glacial ice including icebergs and ice islands, and open water interruptions of the ice cover including leads between ice floes. Such continuous highly detailed ice measurements, along with concurrent measurements of ice velocities and ocean current profiles, are essential to understandings of mechanical and thermodynamical aspects of sea ice processes which govern ocean-atmosphere exchanges in polar waters, thereby determining ice extent and thickness parameters. The ice profiler ULS instrument can sample at higher sampling frequencies to measure non-directional ocean wave spectra and parameters (significant and individual maximum wave heights and peak periods) both during the period of mostly open water, often from mid-summer to mid-autumn, and also when ocean waves propagate into the periphery of the Arctic Ocean pack ice. Ocean wave interactions with pack ice are important in understanding the fracturing of sea ice floes and hastening the deterioration and melt of sea ice. The ULS data provide the first detailed measurements of such ocean wave-ice processes.A major challenge in moored ULS measurement systems is the inaccessibility of the measurement sites to ship logistics due to the very remote areas in the Arctic Ocean and its peripheral seas and the difficulty, resulting in very high logistic costs, of deployment and servicing the moorings due to the sea ice itself. This challenge is being addressed through the development of expanded capacity and more efficient internal power capability and increased onboard data storage, along with very high instrument reliability. With expanded alkaline battery packs, continuous operation for 2 to 3 years is now possible; lithium battery packs are being developed that will extend the in-situ ULS instrument operation to approximately five years.To provide access to the ULS data between mooring servicing intervals, two different approaches are being developed. In some areas cabled underwater observatory technology can be installed to provide real-time access to the ULS ice measurements in support of navigation and oil and gas exploration activities as previously described in Fissel et al. (2009) for sub-Arctic applications. The first such ocean observatory involving a ULS ice instrument was commissioned at Cambridge Bay in the Canadian Arctic in September 2012. At locations far from shorelines, the challenges become even greater. For offshore oil and gas drilling applications, an array of subsurface ULS moorings spanning distances of tens of kilometers, interconnected via bottom mounted fiber optics cable systems interfaced to the moored ULS instruments and to vessel platforms using acoustic modems, have been designed to provide tactical support for ice management operations in support of drilling activities. An alternative approach to provide yearly access to the multi-year moored ULS data sets is the development of small expendable buoyant datapods which store the ULS data on flash cards; during times of open water or very thin ice, the datapods are released from the mooring to float to the surface and the ULS data is then transmitted via satellite to Provide remote access to the scientific users. There are variations on this approach involving aircraft landing on sea ice in the vicinity of the subsurface ULS moorings to access the data via on-command acoustic modem transmission of the data to acoustic receivers operated through ice holes.",,,,,MTS/IEEE Oceans ConferenceMTS/IEEE Oceans Conference,"SEP 23-27, 2013SEP 23-27, 2013","IEEE; Marine Technol Soc; IEEE Oceanic Engn Soc; Newfoundland Labrador; Seacon; UC San Diego, Scripps Inst OceanogIEEE; Marine Technol Soc; IEEE Oceanic Engn Soc; Newfoundland Labrador; Seacon; UC San Diego, Scripps Inst Oceanog","San Diego, CASan Diego, CA",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,0197-7385,,978-0-933957-40-4,,,,,,,,,"ASL Environm Sci Inc, Victoria, BC, Canada",ASL Environm Sci Inc,,,2014-05-28,WOS:000334165802027,,

In this paper, specific attention is paid to renewable energy technologies (RETs) for electricity and heat generation and reviews current understanding and estimates of life cycle GHG emissions from a range of renewable electricity and heat generation technologies. Comprehensive literature reviews for each RET were carried out. The 79 studies reviewed involved the life cycle assessment (LCA) of renewable electricity and heat generation based on onshore and offshore winds, hydropower, marine technologies (wave power and tidal energy), geothermal, photovoltaic (PV), solar thermal, biomass, waste, and heat pumps. The study demonstrates the variability of existing LCA studies (results) in tracking GHG emissions for electricity and heat generation from RETs. This review has shown that the lowest GHG emissions were associated with offshore wind technologies (mean life cycle GHG emissions could be 5.3-13 g CO2 eq/kWh). Results compared with GHG estimates by fossil fuel heat and electricity indicated that life cycle GHG emissions are comparatively higher in conventional sources as compared to renewable sources with the exception of nuclear-based power electricity generation. In this present study, considering renewable energy sources, waste treatment and dedicated biomass technologies (DBTs) were found to potentially have high GHG emissions based on the feedstock, selected boundary and the inputs required for their production. The study identifies additional impacts associated with renewable electricity and heat technologies, points out the effectiveness of life cycle analysis (LCA) as a tool for assessing environmental impacts of renewable energy sources and concludes with opportunities for improvement in the future.

The validation system provides a complete record of all validation methods, data, and results.The principle benefits of the automated validation system are: the combined validation tests are completely documented with an HTML report, the tests are easily repeated, the system quickly reveals flaws arising from model maintenance and development activities, the system can be adapted to other numerical models containing standalone executable modules that read and write text files.The automatic validation system consists of several parts: (1) a hierarchical arrangement of data to segregate individual experiments in separate file system directories; (2) command scripts to run validation tests in each directory (model runs, statistical comparisons of predictions and observations, plots of predictions compared with observations); (3) a top-level script to summarize overall comparison statistics and scatter plots; (4) a report generator to assemble validation results in a linked set of HTML pages with plots; and (5) a tool to compare validations run at different times (e.g., to compare predictions of different versions of the model).Experiments included in the validation system are summarized briefly.

Rapid growth in annual CO2 emissions is likely: in India, the nine planned ultramega power plants alone could add some 257 Mt CO2 to annual emissions. The main potential CO2 storage sites in India are located in the saline aquifers and oil and gas fields around the margins of the peninsula, especially offshore, but also onshore in the states of Gujarat and Rajasthan. There is also thought to be considerable saline aquifer CO2 storage potential in NE India, but this is distant from the main emission sources. CO2 sources in the centre of the peninsula appear to be poorly placed with respect to potential CO2 storage sites. There is estimated to be about 5Gt CO2 storage potential in India's major coalfields and oil and gas fields. It is important that India's saline aquifer storage capacity is quantified, as this will determine whether there is significant potential for the application of CCS. Pakistan will have significant CO2 storage potential (c. 1.6 Gt CO2) in its gas fields when they become depleted. It is also thought to have good potential for saline aquifer CO2 storage in the Lower Indus and Potwar Basins and there is a good match between the locations of sources and potential storage sites. Bangladesh's annual CO2 emissions from large point sources are approximately 17 Mt CO2. It is thought to have significant CO2 storage potential in its gas fields (c. 1.1 Gt CO2) which will become available gradually as the individual fields are depleted. Bangladesh also probably has significant CO2 storage potential in saline aquifers in most of the eastern half of the country, both onshore and offshore. Sri Lanka's total annual emissions of CO2 from large point sources are estimated to be approximately 3 Mt. These will be increased by the operation of new coal-fired power plant.

Blood enzymes often elevated by xenobiotics were not related to PCB concentrations in sea otters. Only sea otters from the unoiled area had estimated risk from PCBs, and PCB composition or concentrations did not correspond to reported lower measures of population performance in sea otters or harlequin ducks from the oiled area.

In addition, a major review and re-analysis of all available data and material from the Great South Basin has recently been completed and a GNS monograph published.East of Stewart Island, the Great South Basin is a large mid-Cretaceous rift basin containing >8 km of sediment. Water depths vary from 0-2000 m, approximately 35,000 km of seismic data have been collected during the last 30 years, and eight wells have been drilled. Oil and gas shows, combined with a condensate discovery in Kawau-1A, demonstrate that the basin is highly prospective. Subsidence models for the basin indicate that there may have been mantle plume activity during rifting, with implications for heat flow and source rock maturity in the Great South Basin and other mid-Cretaceous rift basins in New Zealand.West of Stewart Island, the Solander and Balleny basins are the offshore extension of Western Southland, which formed during Cretaceous and late Eocene extensional tectonics, but have been significantly deformed by later strike-slip and convergent tectonics. The region within 50 km of the coast has been explored for oil and gas, and two offshore wells have been drilled, but the region remains under-explored. Crustal and high resolution seismic reflection/refraction data, and very detailed bathymetric data have been acquired during the last 7 years from the Solander Basin and Puysegur Bank-Fiordland margin. The new data allow the structure of the region to be better determined, and dredge samples place new age constraints on Balleny Basin stratigraphy. Refraction and reflection data from the Puysegur Bank and Puysegur trench-slope show that most of the area is underlain by sediments >3 km thick, and may be prospective.The Canterbury, Great South, and Western Southland basins certainly contain both liquid and gaseous hydrocarbons. However, the basins are under-explored and there is no commercial production in the region. Drilling the basins remains a moderately high risk venture, but has the potential for high return. If hydrocarbon production is developed, it is likely that a large resource inventory will ultimately be established in the region.",,,,,8th New Zealand Petroleum Conference8th New Zealand Petroleum Conference,"MAR 19-22, 2000MAR 19-22, 2000",Crown Minerals; Contact; Fletcher Challenge Energy; NZ Oil & Gas; PEANZ; Shell Co Ltd; Westech Orion; Methanex; Natl Gas Coprp; Venture TaranakiCrown Minerals; Contact; Fletcher Challenge Energy; NZ Oil & Gas; PEANZ; Shell Co Ltd; Westech Orion; Methanex; Natl Gas Coprp; Venture Taranaki,"CHRISTCHURCH, NEW ZEALANDCHRISTCHURCH, NEW ZEALAND",2,0,0,0,1,0,2,,,,,0-478-23482-1,,,,,,,,,"Inst Geol & Nucl Sci Ltd, Lower Hutt, New Zealand",,,,2000-01-01,WOS:000177511800018,,

First, CO2 absorption is achieved with readily available and environmentally friendly aqueous amino acid solutions (glycine and sarcosine) using a household humidifier. The CO2-loaded solutions are then reacted with a simple guanidine compound, which crystallizes as a very insoluble carbonate salt and regenerates the amino acid sorbent. Finally, effective CO2 release and near-quantitative regeneration of the guanidine compound are achieved by relatively mild heating of the carbonate crystals using concentrated solar power.",,,,,,,,,127,4,0,0,13,0,134,,,2058-7546,,,,,,,,,,,"Oak Ridge Natl Lab, Chem Sci Div, Oak Ridge, TN 37830 USA",,,,2018-12-28,WOS:000438355300012,,

This includes wave energy harvesting, tidal energy harvesting, ocean thermal energy and the utilisation of salinity gradients for electricity generation.The work emphasises the fact that these new emerging technologies are currently at the developing stages and has a long way to go before successful commercialization and wide adoption become the norm.The work stresses the need for more research and developmental work to address several of the technical issues that need to be addressed including devices designs, their installation and maintenance, the infrastructure which includes the grid and power transmission as well as losses, their use in arrays, and their longevity.This work underlines the lack of reliable studies on the long term impacts of these technologies on both the marine environment and nearby habitations and highlights the need for proper environmental and social impact assessments of these technologies.The work concludes that combination of technical, policy and economic advances will enable marine energy technologies to play a large role in combination with currently adopted non-pollution renewable energy resources to provide the world population with their energy needs and contribute to affecting significant reduction in the use of non-renewable and other polluting fuels worldwide.

However, the proliferation of offshore oil and gas installations portends a marked increase in oil spills from these sources. This presents a unique enforcement challenge for international and Chinese domestic systems for oil pollution liability and compensation that were developed in response to the threat of ship-based oil pollution. This article focuses on how the international liability and compensation regime for oil pollution has been implemented in China, and whether a combination of the international regime and domestic Chinese regulations could provide an adequate mechanism for holding offshore oil operators liable for accidents and for ensuring adequate compensation to injured parties. Analysis of Chinese law demonstrates that the current international liability and compensation regime for oil pollution, the 1992 Civil Liability Convention (CLC)-International Oil Pollution Compensation (IOPC Funds), has been only partially implemented in China and lacks domestic adaptation mechanisms. The CLC-IOPC Funds regime also does not extend to oil pollution accidents resulting from offshore operations. An international convention containing universal liability provisions for offshore oil spill accidents would require a long-term process of joint international efforts. Based on this international and domestic Chinese legal environment, this article concludes that China should first develop a domestic liability and compensation mechanism that implements the international regime for ship-source oil pollution in its entirety, but which also extends to pollution caused by offshore oil spills.",,,,,,,,,7,0,0,0,2,0,8,,,0028-0739,,,,,,,,,,,"Tilburg Univ, Tilburg Law Sch, Dept European & Int Publ Law, Int Environm Law, Tilburg, NetherlandsTilburg Univ, Tilburg Sustainabil Ctr, Tilburg, Netherlands",,,,2017-08-08,WOS:000405655900006,,

We evaluated the impact of breeding success on territory retention of Pacific (Gavia pacifica) and Yellow-billed (G. adamsii) loons in the National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska on the Arctic Coastal Plain of northern Alaska using mark-resight data and multi-state modeling. We also used behavioral observations of brood-rearing adult loons to quantify the frequency of visits by prospecting loons. We hypothesized that increased competition for productive territories would result in a decrease in territory retention rates. Territory retention rates the year following successful breeding attempts were only slightly lower (0.90) than after failed breeding attempts (0.93), and few territories were consistently successful across years. Overall territory retention rates were high (0.92) and similar for both species, suggesting that adults were able to defend their territories successfully. Males had higher territory retention rates than females, but we found no influence of mass (a possible proxy for fighting ability) on territory retention. These observations, coupled with the high frequency of visits by prospecting loons, provide additional evidence that site familiarity may provide advantages to territory holders. Quantifying territory retention behaviors may also inform land management decisions for oil and gas development in areas where loons are present. High territory retention rates, frequency of visits by prospectors, and limited habitat where new territories can be established suggest that breeding habitat in northern Alaska is saturated and may be limiting Yellow-billed Loon populations. In contrast, Pacific Loons attempting to acquire a territory may be able to form new territories on smaller, unoccupied lakes.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,0010-5422,,,,,,,,,,,"US Geol Survey, Alaska Sci Ctr, Anchorage, AK, 99508, USA",,,,2019-11-18,ZOOREC:ZOOR15512080972,,

The flow is simulated in 2D, using the shallow water equations. For an M-2 tide, the natural flow conditions exhibit local spatial mean and maximum flow speeds of 2 and 3 m/s. Upper limits to power extraction are about 298 MW for M-2 and 330 MW for M-2+S-2 tidal signals (different to undisturbed kinetic power and power naturally dissipated at the seabed). An analytical model of a channel connecting two infinite ocean basins underpredicts maximum power extracted in Rathlin Sound due to changes in head driving the flow and the existence of an alternative flow path. At maximum power extracted, there is substantial reduction in mean flow speeds in the strait and to the south-east of Rathlin Sound. In the strait, maximum power is reduced by 14% and 36% for blockage ratios of 80% and 60%. Power extraction both offshore of the island and in the strait yields higher power generation rates than isolated extraction.

For instance, the ecological effects of hydrocarbon releases in the sea are of paramount concern. One way to assess their environmental impact is to consider the amount of pollutant discharged. Effective early detection would help in revealing spills in advance and take the necessary mitigating measures to contain the released volume. Standards and guidelines are established for developing effective sensor networks in the subsea templates for monitoring purposes and data collection. Sensors provide a heterogeneous amount of information about the template they are monitoring. According to recent studies on risk assessment, the level of knowledge about a specific system is an intrinsic feature that should be considered during the assessment and evaluation phases for better managing potential increments of the risk level. The information provided by sensor networks may be used in this perspective. Sensors may be functionally placed in fault tree analyses and update the information about frequency deviation. The work in this paper is focused on risk management using such information from subsea sensor networks. A real reference case from the oil and gas industry located in an environmentally sensitive area on the Norwegian Continental Shelf is provided for testing the suggested approach.

With this in mind, we used the platform to shoot 3 400 photos over a distance of about 500 m along the upper limit of the shallow Posidonia oceanica meadows of the Mugel, a creek in La Ciotat (France). The underwater photographs and the position data from the GNSS were synchronized to provide each picture with geographic coordinates. All the photos were then processed to build an orthomosaic of the meadow limit. Owing to its high resolution, the orthomosaic enabled the mapping of various features of the seascape such as the position of the limit with a centimetric accuracy, dead matte patches, litter detritus, artificial objects (moorings, wrecks) and marine organisms living on the seafloor.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,0240-8759,,,,,,,,,,,"Seaviews, 603 Chemin Severiers, F-13600 La Ciotat, FranceAgence Eau Rhone Mdditerrande Corse, 62 Canebiere, F-13001 Marseille, France",SeaviewsAgence Eau Rhone Mdditerrande Corse,,,2021-07-31,WOS:000675537200028,,

However, challenges of prior site conditions, seasonal flooding, soil texture and lack of nearby seed sources can necessitate planting of seedlings to achieve desirable results, particularly for large-seeded species like oaks. Therefore, the objectives of this study were to compare growth and survival of two species of oaks common to southeastern and bottomland hardwood forests, cherrybark oak (Quercus pagoda Raf.) and willow oak (Quercus phellos L.) from 1-0 bareroot, conventional container (0.24 L) and large container (3.8 L) planting stocks across two growing seasons. Additionally, we sought to compare physiology across seedling types to determine the underlying differences in functioning that led to the growth responses. Despite above average rainfall, growth was modest particularly at the site that was previously pasture land and for willow oak which also exhibited net dieback. Two-year survival was adequate (> 75%) for bareroot and large container seedlings but was suboptimal (similar to 50%) for conventional container seedlings. Large container seedlings had about 40% higher photosynthetic rates and 70% higher water use efficiencies compared to bareroot and conventional container seedlings. Cherrybark oak exhibited greater stomatal regulation across the growing season than willow oak, however all seedling types displayed increased stomatal conductance and decreased water use efficiency throughout the growing season. Overall, these findings highlight the importance of matching species to site conditions and providing competition control particularly on grassland sites and during above average rainfall conditions.",,,,,,,,,4,0,0,0,4,0,4,,,0169-4286,1573-5095,,,,,,,,,,"Mississippi State Univ, Dept Forestry, Box 9681, Mississippi State, MS 39762 USA",,,,2020-03-09,WOS:000515175900001,,

It explores the failure of the Bill to include marine protection of over 3,000,000 km 2 of the waters associated with overseas territories and Crown dependencies. It explains the necessity for close liaison with the European Commission and with the devolved administrations in Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales, where responsibility for marine governance is not clear cut. It expresses some disappointment in the failure of the Bill to cover questions of ownership of marine resources in particular the right to fish, which remains held under ancient and flawed common law rules. The paper then investigates the content of the Bill, looking at the role and functions of the Marine Management Organisation including licensing of fishing vessels, wind farm consenting/creation of safety zones, consents under the Wildlife and Countryside Act, research, advice, assistance, training, and prosecutions. The Bill also establishes a framework for marine planning with potential for the creation of marine plans and marine policy statements covering the waters of England and Wales to the edge of the UK Exclusive Economic Zone. Such plans and statements will have persuasive effects on the organisations involved in marine management, but will not be completely binding. The Bill creates powers to licence numerous activities and if necessary delegate licensing function to the bodies such as the Marine Management Organisation. It also established new powers for the creation of Marine Conservation Zones. The paper explores the narrow purposes for which these Marine Conservation Zones and created, and contrasts these unfavourably with the draft Scottish Marine Bill, which permits Marine Conservation Zones for such purposes as community interest. The paper also acknowledges that no target has been set for the creation of Marine Conservation Zones, and raises some concerns over whether Marine Conservation Zones contain severe enough penalties, particularly in respect of commercial fishing where there is a specific exemption for fisheries damage. The paper explores the function of the new Inshore Fisheries Authorities which will replace existing Sea Fisheries Committees, but raises concerns that the new organisations will still remain vulnerable to conflicts of interests because of their membership.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,2182-9446,,,,,,,,,,,"Univ West England, Sch Built & Nat Environm, Coldharbour Lane,Frenchay Campus, Bristol BS16 1QY, Avon, EnglandUniv Bristol, Law Sch, Bristol BS8 1RJ, Avon, England",,,,2009-08-01,WOS:000447447400003,,

A key governance challenge is operationalizing standards for the permanence of carbon sequestered in terrestrial and coastal ecosystems. There are multiple risks of reversal of carbon storage in these ecosystems and release of carbon back to the atmosphere. This paper reviews issues of permanence in four approaches for carbon removal focusing on carbon uptake and potential side-effects of long-term land commitments. Recognizing that permanence is a considerable barrier to large-scale application of land-based carbon removal, we argue that temporary carbon storage can still provide climate benefits in the short run.

Calibration of the model, based on observed maturity (vitrinite reflectance) and present-day temperatures, took into account (1) two main erosion episodes: an Oligocene-Miocene event, due to tectonic uplift and a Plio-Pleistocene glacial erosion event, and (2) variable heat flow from Late Palaeozoic to Cenozoic. The maturity levels of the main source rocks (Kobbe, Snadd and Hekkingen formations) were reconstructed and show that the highest maturities have been reached in the western and northwestern margin of the basin. The beginning of petroleum generation in the Kobbe, Snadd and Hekkingen source rocks has been predicted to occur during Late Triassic, Early Cretaceous and Late Cretaceous, respectively. Our model reproduces satisfactorily the distribution of the main oil and gas fields and discoveries that have been found in the study area. Our results indicate that two events of hydrocarbons redistribution occurred in the basin. The first event resulted in the main oil redistribution episode, which took place during the Oligocene-Miocene associated with tectonic uplift and gas expansion, and the second was related to the main gas leakage events that occurred during the Pliocene-Pleistocene glacialinterglacial cycles in general and the episodes of glacial retreat in particular. Glacial loading and unloading cycles resulted in overpressure fluctuations in the subsurface reservoirs. Modelling results indicate that during these episodes a portion (at least 0.247 Gt) of thermogenic gas leaked from the main Sto Formation reservoirs reached the sediment interface and was released to the surface in the Hammerfest Basin.

With only one offshore wind farm in operation, developers have cited regulatory burdens and excessive litigation as two of the primary constraints on the industry. Currently, these developers must go through several governmental approval processes, including working with the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, the Army Corps of Engineers, and state governments. While these lengthy processes rightly offer plenty of opportunities for people to work out legitimate concerns about the projects, some offshore wind opponents have used the process to try to stall and ultimately kill projects.To help remedy some of that uncertainty plaguing the industry, this Note proposes a new nationwide permit, issued by the Army Corps of Engineers, that would be used exclusively to authorize offshore wind transmission lines. These nationwide permits would drastically speed up approval times, as developers could forgo trying to get their projects individually approved and could instead get their project to fit under these pre-approved permits. Traditionally, the Army Corps of Engineers issues nationwide permits pursuant to its authority under Section 404 of the Clean Water Act and Section 10 of the Rivers and Harbors Act of 1899. However, as seen in Sierra Club v. Army Corps of Engineers, projects that use nationwide permits can still be tied up in legal challenges for years when their permits are issued pursuant to Section 404 of the Clean Water Act.Therefore, this new nationwide permit would only authorize construction activities that do not constitute a discharge of dredged materials, which would trigger the need for a Section 404 permit. This proposed permit would only allow construction projects with minimal adverse environmental effects and would help with the current needless delay facing offshore wind projects. By streamlining this part of the process, offshore wind developers would have greater certainty and greater ability to attract capital, and the United States would continue to build up an industry that is critical in our fight against climate change.",,,,,,,,,4,0,0,0,0,0,4,,,0046-1121,,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Calif Berkeley, Sch Law, Boalt Hall, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA",,,,2021-09-18,WOS:000686407300008,,

The tangue, a specific sediment of this area, displays an alternated structure of sandy and silty-muddy beds generated by the dynamics of tidal currents. This tidal bedding is frequently characterized by a vertical organization determined by the cyclic evolution of tidal energy during a neap/spring cycle. The organisation mainly consists in thickness variation of the successive sand/mud couplets which represent the deposit of each semi-diurnal tidal cycle. This record of tidal cyclicity can be observed in a wide range of bedding from planar bedding to climbing ripple bedding. The investigations performed allowed to clarify the conditions of deposition and of short-term preservation of these tidal rhythmites. Most well recorded neap/spring cycles develop within protected environments and necessarily require high suspended sediment concentrations. Characteristic features of these modern tidal rhythmites, such as the number of tidal event recorded per neap/spring cycle, are discussed in order to select criteria for the recognition of tidal dynamics in ancient sediments. The use of such criteria should constitute a way to discriminate subtidal to upper intertidal deposits and to propose paleogeographic reconstructions.",,,,,,,,,86,0,0,0,4,1,96,,,0025-3227,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1993-03-01,WOS:A1993KU34800009,,

Land use change not only influences carbon storage in terrestrial ecosystems directly, but it also indirectly affects anthropogenic carbon emissions, which occur more frequently in coastal regions. Based on data of energy consumption, industrial products, waste, soil organic carbon, and vegetation, together with land use images of five typical years, this paper calculated the total carbon emissions in coastal Jiangsu, China, assigned the detailed carbon emission items to different land use types, and optimized land use structure to low carbon emissions using the Linear Programming Model. It was found that carbon emission intensity in coastal Jiangsu was much higher than the average for China as a whole, and that energy consumption contributed most to local carbon emissions with the contribution from animals second. Urban land accounted for the most concentrated and highest intensity of carbon emissions. Between 1985 and 2010, the transfer of cropland to built-up land accounted for the largest percentage of the total transferred area and contributed most to the increase of carbon emissions. In particular, the limitation of urban land will play a key role in carbon emission reduction. Our optimized land use structure can control and decrease carbon emissions effectively and thus, it is an important tool worth the consideration of land managers and policy makers.

The study describes and analyses high-amplitude discordant amplitude anomalies within the Oligocene succession in the eastern North Sea, which are interpreted as large-scale brine-saturated sand injectites. Potential feeder conduits extending from the top of the Paleocene Lista Formation to the base of the injectites indicate that the source sand was located within the Lista Formation; possibly deposited in a distinct valley cut into the top of the Chalk Group. The geometry of the observed injectites ranges from a basal sill with wings to V-shaped and conical; their dimensions range from 300 to 3700 m in width and up to 150 m in height. In all cases, a significant deformation of the overburden is observed. The study area is located in the Ringkobing-Fyn High area above the basement high separating two smaller Paleozoic half-grabens. During the Oligocene, rapid and significant differential loading occurred. We interpret that the injectites formed due to remobilization of the source sand facilitated by overpressure caused by differential loading combined with a possible influx of fluids from the deeper succession.

However, due to the complex and dynamic ocean environment, marine sensors could be captured by malicious attackers and then become Byzantine sensors. Byzantine sensors may tamper with the actual sensor data at a fixed or time-varying probability and transmit it to the data fusion center (DFC), which renders the normal localization and tracking function of the search and rescue system downgrade or even fail. To address this issue, we develop a New robust marine mobile Multi-Target LocAlization and Tracking scheme called NMTLAT by eliminating abnormal measurement data from the initial measurement data. NMTLAT works in several steps. By analyzing and mining sensors data and behavior, we firstly employ the information entropy of the system composed of a single sensor and their neighbor sensors to develop an efficient dynamic threshold based Byzantine node identification method. After migrating Byzantine sensors, the DFC utilizes sensor-aware and preprocessed marine data of the beacon or honest sensors to complete target localization and trajectory tracking. Specifically, NMTLAT consists of a novel distributed and cooperative multi-target localization and tracking algorithm using both received signal strength indication (RSSI) and priori information of sensors location. NMTLAT employs the importance sampling method to approximate the posterior probability distribution of the sensors and targets location. Furthermore, when the marine target is outside MSR-WSNs coverage, a piecewise function is utilized to characterize the likelihood of finding a drowning target in the search and rescue sea area. Finally, the Lyapunov's second stability theorem is adopted to measure the stability of the NMTLAT. Our extensive simulation experiments validate that the NMTLAT performance is superior to existing solutions in various marine search and rescue scenarios.",,,,,,,,,10,1,0,0,0,0,10,,,0140-3664,1873-703X,,,,,,,,,,"Shanghai Maritime Univ, Merchant Marine Coll, Shanghai 201306, Peoples R ChinaPolitecn Torino, Dept Elect & Telecommun, I-10129 Turin, ItalyUniv Lisbon, Inst Super Tecn, Inst Syst & Robot, P-1049001 Lisbon, PortugalUniv Cent Florida, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, Orlando, FL 32816 USA",,,,2020-07-01,WOS:000575728300012,,

It is paramount to have knowledge of the geomechanical strength of a system's lithologies, and the factors that control it, in order to maintain optimal conditions during extraction/injection. If the yield strengths of the reservoir or caprock are overcome, particularly in the near-wellbore region where stress is amplified, these fluctuations could potentially compromise the system, through compactional or dilatational failure. Here we have used a novel combination of methods to determine the geomechanical and petrographic properties of the reservoir and caprock lithologies to assess suitability of the proposed Acorn CO2 Storage Site, offshore north-east Scotland, for long-term injection and storage of CO2.The Acorn CO2 Storage Site has a highly porous and transmissible sandstone reservoir, with bulk mineralogy that will be stable under CO2-rich conditions, making it ideal for receiving at least 152 MT CO2 injected over similar to 20 years and storage of > 1000 years post-injection, as part of the ACT-Acorn Development Plan. However, due to the high porosity and low cementation of the sandstone reservoir, it has low yield strength and is vulnerable to disaggregation and porosity-reduction if injection rates are too high and stress/pressure conditions exceed their yield strength. The results presented here provide quantitative constraints on the porosity reduction expected should yield occur and place limits on CO2 injection rates.

Specifically, ditches have existed on salt marshes for decades, but the effects of these hydrologic alterations are only poorly understood. Ditch-plugging is a more recent methodology used for salt marsh habitat enhancement and mosquito control, but the long-term effects from this management practice are also unclear. The interactions involving marsh surface elevation, soil characteristics, and hydrologic regimes result in feedbacks that regulate the salt marsh self-maintenance process, and these interactions vary with hydrologic modification. Using natural tidal creeks and pools as controls, we examined the effects of ditching and plugging, respectively, on hydrology, surface elevations, and soils. Results showed the most apparent effects of altered hydrology from ditching are prolonged pore-water retention in the rooting zone and significantly lower soil bulk density and mineral content when compared with natural creek habitat. From a management perspective, the important question is whether the combined alterations to physical and biological processes will hinder the marsh's ability to keep pace with increasing rates of sea level rise, especially in more heavily ditched marshes. In contrast, ditch-plugging results in the decoupling of feedback processes that promote salt marsh self-maintenance and in doing so, threatens marsh stability and resilience to climate change. High surface water levels, permanently saturated soils, marsh subsidence, and significantly lower bulk density, carbon storage, soil strength, and redox levels associated with hydrologic alterations from ditch-plugging all support this conclusion.",,,,,,,,,33,2,0,0,26,0,44,,,1559-2723,1559-2731,,,,,,,,,,"NOAA, Fisheries Serv, Gloucester, MA 01930 USAUniv New Hampshire, Jackson Estuarine Lab, Durham, NH 03824 USAWells Natl Estuarine Res Reserve, Wells, ME 04090 USA",Wells Natl Estuarine Res Reserve,,,2013-05-29,WOS:000318295300014,,

We have previously proven the feasibility of biological nitrogen removal of amines in a moving bed biofilm reactor (MBBR) in pre-denitrification mode, thereby serving as a carbon source for denitrification. To evaluate novel solvents, it is essential to test their biodegradability under anoxic conditions. Generally, biodegradability is assessed by standardized aerobic tests, but no equivalent method is available for anoxic degradation. Therefore, a new anoxic batch screening test in syringes was used, measuring the headspace volume expansion due to produced N-2 gas over time. Aerobic biodegradability was measured the conventional way by determining the biological oxygen demand (BOD). Nine different amine samples were tested, including monoethanolamine (MEA) and reclaimer waste. Comparison of biodegradability under aerobic fresh and sea water conditions showed generally improved biodegradation in fresh water. The anoxic screening identified subgroups of amines classified as a) easily degradable, b) slowly degradable and c) undegraded. The results show that BOD alone cannot be relied upon as the only parameter to describe biodegradability.

We use pore water geochemistry, pressure core CT scanning, degassing quantification, seismic data and in situ temperature test at four drill sites (W01, W07, W08 and W09) to investigate the gas hydrate characteristics and discuss the dynamics of the gas hydrate system. Based on the CT scanning and pressure core degassing, we demonstrate the coexistence of pore-filling and veinlike gas hydrates. Gas hydrate saturation estimated based on the chloride concentration (0-92%) is higher than that based on the degassing quantification (0-52.9%). The saturation discrepancy is mainly resulted from the sampling discrimination. Based on the average gas hydrate saturation estimated using chloride concentration and degassing, the methane gas volume contained in the gas hydrate of one cubic meter sediment at drill sites W07, W08 and W09 are calculated to be 13.7 m(3), 26.82 m(3) and 22.24 m(3) and 3.03 m(3), 14.30 m(3) and 16.25 m(3). The geothermal gradients estimated based on the in situ temperature measurements at sites W07, W08 and W09 (102-111 degrees C/km) are more than 50% higher than that at the background site W01 (65 degrees C/km). It is inferred that the fractures and faults in the gas chimney at sites W07, W08 and W09 are the major contributors for the efficient fluid pathways and high geothermal gradients. The pore water sulfate profiles and inferred sulfate-reduction methane-oxidation interface (SMI) depths indicate that methane flux is lowest at site W01 and highest at site W08. The SMI depths and top of gas hydrate occurrence is linearly correlated which provides an experienced function for understanding the local gas hydrate distribution. Kick-type sulfate profiles at sites W07 and W09 indicate an ongoing increase of methane flux and corresponding shoaling SMI depths. In addition, chloride enrichment in the shallow sediment at site W08 indicates a recent fast gas hydrate formation process. The kick-type sulfate profiles, positive chloride anomalies and authigenic carbonates at multiple depths suggest that the system experienced dynamic changes in fluid flux and multi-stage gas hydrate evolution on time scale from months to thousands of years. Understanding the controlling mechanism and periodicity of the composite pressure system is important for evaluating the gas hydrate resource and carbon cycling.",,,,,,,,,96,27,0,0,12,0,111,,,0264-8172,1873-4073,,,,,,,,,,"Guangzhou Marine Geol Survey, Gas Hydrate Engn & Technol Ctr, Guangzhou 510075, Guangdong, Peoples R ChinaGuangzhou Marine Geol Survey, MLR Key Lab Marine Mineral Resources, Guangzhou 510075, Guangdong, Peoples R China",,,,2019-12-13,WOS:000498747500018,,

By bringing together experts in ecololgy and development it will find new ways to help local people maintain their coastal resources whilst beating poverty. In particular, it will work with people dependent on resources from mangroves and seagrasses, two ecosystems that are vitally important for fish, coastal protection and the capture and storage of carbon but which are suffering high rates of destruction.The project team will help with the local and national management of these ecosystems in three ways:First we will work with the forestry departments in Kenya and Zanzibar to identify how they can better support community efforts at conservation and management. Laws already exist that allow community control of coastal resources; on paper these should mean local people benefiting from their resources whilst conserving them. But achieving this needs the help and support of the relevant government institutions and this often fails to happen on the ground. CESEA research will identify what the barriers are to this and how it can happen more effectively, and open up new channels of communication between the local communities and the government bodies.Second we will research how to include seagrass meadows into payments for ecosystem services projects. Seagrasses are ecologically linked with mangrove forests - both act as nursery grounds for fish, as protection for coastlines, as sites for the filtering and removal of pollution and as sinks for carbon. We know how to measure the carbon in mangroves and how to use this carbon storage for the benefit of local people, through selling 'carbon credits' for well managed forests. This has never been achieved for seagrasses, despite their strong links with the mangrove ecosystems. For the first time we will develop the scientific methods necessary to measure the amounts and sources of carbon in these systems in such a way that community organisations could follow our methods. We will recommend ways in which the results of this science could be used in combination with mangrove systems to sell carbon to international markets.Third we will explore why some communities in East Africa already have a good record of managing their mangroves and seagrasses whilst others have degraded ecosystems. We will let the successful local communities share their knowledge with other communities in the region and help produce guidelines for how this can be done. We will organise meetings between local community leaders and the government officers and executives with responsibility for helping community management of mangroves and seagrass resources. These will be a powerful way of ensuring that the voices of communities are heard and that national plans can be informed by their experiences.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,NE/L001535/1,,,,,,,,Edinburgh Napier University,,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:15301408,,

The review highlights the overall paucity of data and inconsistencies in the measurement of radionuclides throughout the Gulf region. Further, since the region is moving toward nuclear energy to meet its increasing energy demand, and coupled with the environmental effects from offshore oil exploration and the heavy impact of climate change, there is a pressing need to undertake a comprehensive marine radioactivity monitoring and assessment effort by conducting a joint cruise in the Gulf with participation of all the adjoining countries.

A common approach description of these sites at local single-site level may permit aggregation for multi-scale decisions, e.g., for remediation and incident response. To adequately manage these sites, a standardized PPMS geospatial database (GeoDB) application has been designed to collect relevant information suitable for site inventory and geo-spatial analysis.

The City marina is located on the East Coast of Florida along the picturesque waters of the Indian River Lagoon and anchors the City's downtown area.The project's initial intent was to restore the structural elements of the marina 'in-kind' and provide 100-year storm protection. However, the project quickly evolved into a 3-fold system, providing storm protection, habitat creation, and water quality enhancement. Along with providing storm damage protection of the marina, upland infrastructure, and surrounding downtown waterfront area - the islands also provide significant environmental enhancements that include mangrove plantings, oyster recruitment, shorebird habitat, and natural limestone artificial reef areas. The State of Florida has recognized this project as a 'pilot study' for its environmentally friendly and sustainable elements - potentially setting the 'bar' for future storm damage protection projects as an alternative to typical shoreline hardening solutions.The storm protection system is anchored by a 10.5 acre island that shelters the marina from the large open water areas and harsh wave climates to the south and southeast. This island is comprised of tee groin stabilized crenulated beaches on the windward side of the island, a coastal sand dune in the center, and a bench for oyster recruitment and mangrove plantings along the leeward side.",,,,,International Symposium on Design and Practice of Geosynthetic-Reinforced Soil Structures / 26th Italian National Conference on GeosyntheticsInternational Symposium on Design and Practice of Geosynthetic-Reinforced Soil Structures / 26th Italian National Conference on Geosynthetics,"OCT 14-16, 2013OCT 14-16, 2013","Int Geosynthet Soc; Italian Geotechn Assoc; IGS, Italian Chapter; Int Soc Soil Mech & Geotechn Engn, TC 101 & TC 305; Amer Soc Civil Engineers, Geo Inst; Univ Bologna, Dept Civil, Chem, Environm & Mat Engn; Univ Delaware, Dept Civil & Environm Engn; Publ Works Res Inst; Railway Tech Res Inst; Natl Inst Rural Engn; ACE Geosynthet; ADAMA Engn; Allan Block; Callide Technologies, Inc; Huesker Synthet GmbH; Intergeo Serv; Micheletto Pavimentazioni; Officine Maccaferri S p A; NAUE GmbH & Co KG; Risi Stone Syst; TeMa Technologies & Mat srl; TENAX; TenCate Geosynthet Asia, Sdn Bhd; Tensar Int Corp; Univ DelawareInt Geosynthet Soc; Italian Geotechn Assoc; IGS, Italian Chapter; Int Soc Soil Mech & Geotechn Engn, TC 101 & TC 305; Amer Soc Civil Engineers, Geo Inst; Univ Bologna, Dept Civil, Chem, Environm & Mat Engn; Univ Delaware, Dept Civil & Environm Engn; Publ Works Res Inst; Railway Tech Res Inst; Natl Inst Rural Engn; ACE Geosynthet; ADAMA Engn; Allan Block; Callide Technologies, Inc; Huesker Synthet GmbH; Intergeo Serv; Micheletto Pavimentazioni; Officine Maccaferri S p A; NAUE GmbH & Co KG; Risi Stone Syst; TeMa Technologies & Mat srl; TENAX; TenCate Geosynthet Asia, Sdn Bhd; Tensar Int Corp; Univ Delaware","Univ Bologna, Bologna, ITALYUniv Bologna, Bologna, ITALY",1,0,0,0,0,0,1,,,,,978-1-60595-108-9,,,,,,,,,"Tetra Tech, 759 South Fed Hwy,Ste 314, Stuart, FL 34994 USAMaccaferri Inc, Williamsport, PA 17701 USACity Port Pierce, Ft Pierce, FL 34954 USA",Tetra TechMaccaferri IncCity Port Pierce,,,2014-02-05,WOS:000329350100068,,

Vegetation biomass of coastal wetlands is not only the key component of blue carbon storage but also plays an important role in vertical accretion, important for maintaining these habitats under relative sea-level rise. Remote sensing offers a cost-effective approach to study vegetation biomass at a broad spatial scale. We developed statistical models to predict peak aboveground green biomass of Spartina alterniflora and Juncus roemerianus, two dominant species of salt marshes using WorldView-2 satellite imagery at the Grand Bay National Estuarine Research Reserve (NERR) on the Mississippi coast in the northern Gulf of Mexico. The model accounted for nested data structures in the sampled biomass, assimilated uncertainties from data, parameters and model structures, and helped determine the best vegetation index among a variety of commonly-used indices to predict aboveground green biomass. We developed a series of mixed-effects models, which included different combinations of fixed effect(s), random intercept, and random slope(s). The fixed effects were species and one of the 60 vegetation indices derived from a WorldView-2 image obtained on 6 October 2012. The random effect used was site. We implemented the models in a Bayesian framework and selected the best model structure and vegetation index based on minimum posterior predictive loss and deviance information criterion. The results showed that the best vegetation index to predict peak green biomass was the green chlorophyll index derived from the reflectance values of band 8 (near-infrared) and band 3 (green), and its effect on biomass prediction varied among sites. The inclusion of species as a fixed effect improved the model prediction. The study demonstrated the need to account for spatial dependence of data in developing a robust model, and the importance of the second WorldView-2 near-infrared band (860-1040nm) in predicting aboveground green biomass for the Grand Bay NERR. The analysis using mixed-effects modeling in Bayesian inference which coherently combined field and WorldView-2 data with uncertainties accounted for provides a robust and nondestructive tool for resource managers to monitor the status of coastal wetlands at a high spatial resolution in a timely manner. Through this study, we hope to emphasize the importance of appropriately accounting for nested data structures using mixed-effects models and promote wider application of Bayesian inference to facilitate assimilation of uncertainties in remote sensing applications.",,,,,,,,,6,0,0,0,4,0,6,,,1548-1603,1943-7226,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Southern Mississippi, Sch Ocean Sci & Technol, Div Coastal Sci, Ocean Springs, MS 39564 USALouisiana State Univ, Louisiana Sea Grant Coll Program, Baton Rouge, LA 70803 USAUniv Georgia UGA, Dept Geog, Ctr Geospatial Res, Athens, GA 30602 USA",,,,2018-10-01,WOS:000445076300005,,

Petroleum geologists build three-dimensional numerical models to assess the likely amount and flow rates of oil and gas and optimum well locations. These models ultimately determine whether hydrocarbon production is successful. (Hydrogeologists develop corresponding geological models to predict water yield or contaminant transport, in order to inform aquifer exploitation and clean-up; such models are also required to assess the feasibility of programmes of underground carbon capture and storage). When these models are built, geologists have available only limited direct subsurface data with which to constrain the type and geometry of subsurface geological bodies and thus their fluid-flow characteristics. To complement the sparse direct data, exposed outcrops of similar types of rocks, or modern sedimentary environments where comparable sediments are deposited, can be used as 'analogues' to hydrocarbon reservoirs or aquifers. These analogues provide proxy information regarding geological features that determine reservoir or aquifer heterogeneity. Within a reservoir or aquifer, these geological heterogeneities exert a primary control on well connectivity, flow rates, and behaviour to production or clean-up strategies, thereby dictating how much oil or gas is likely to be produced from a reservoir, or whether contaminants are successfully removed from the groundwater. Quantitative analogue data on these geological heterogeneities are required as input for constraining geological models of the subsurface. The derivation of this type of data from databases is an integral part of subsurface modelling workflows, but current approaches are inadequate because of the limited volume and quality of data stored in existing databases, and their current poor integration with existing modelling tools.The Leeds IP consists of three different relational databases that contain analogue data about types of rock volumes that constitute the building blocks of geological models of reservoirs or aquifers; each database relates to a particular geological setting. All data are stored in a format that allows quantitative output to be produced, in forms that can be fed into all the common numerical methods used to build models of subsurface heterogeneity. The technology of the IP surpasses similar databases in terms of data quality and format. The fact that a fuller characterisation of sedimentary heterogeneity is achieved by these databases enables the derivation of the output required by existing modelling algorithms: this makes the IP unique in its class.However, the current value of the combined IP is limited by the relative underdevelopment of the Deep Marine Clastic database, and its current inability to integrate fully with software platforms employed to generate and manage geological models of the subsurface, such as Schlumberger's Petrel. Thus, the up-scaling of this database and the development of an interface for the optimal integration of the Deep Marine Clastic database with Petrel are key requirements for making this IP marketable, and leveraging the full value of the integrated databases. Upon successful development, the IP will enable easy access and application of large volumes of high-quality data in the area of Deep Marine Clastics, in parallel with that from other environments. This technology will aid geologists and engineers in the hydrocarbon and water-management industries in the generation of geologically sensible reservoir and aquifer models. The project will be undertaken by Marco Patacci, currently a PDRA at Leeds, and supervised by Bill McCaffrey, who is a sedimentologist and director of the Turbidites Research Group, and Nigel Mountney (sedimentologist).",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,NE/P01691X/1,,,,,,,,University of Leeds,,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:15509883,,

A number of publications have investigated the definition, engineering requirements, economic and finance of CCR for China. However there remain a number of questions regarding the extent to which a plant's physical location might constrain the feasibility of CCS retrofit. To address this issue, a Geographical Information System (GIS) has been used as a tool for mapping current and planned large carbon dioxide sources in Guangdong, also illustrating potential storage sites and calculating possible carbon dioxide transportation route.This paper investigates the location factors that should be considered when locating new build CCR power plants and demonstrates the methodology of using GIS software with spatial analysis in planning new build power plant in Guangdong. A preliminary study has identified over 30 large power plants within the region, with plant locations and historical emission data collected and presented in ArcGIS. Factors such as distance to potential storage site, route of CO2 pipeline, extra space on site and potential development plan etc. were investigated in the modelling and calculated the potential source and sink solution. The study then moves on to suggest possible new build plant locations which can be easily fitted in to the current network, based on economic optimisation. The scope for future coal plant development combined with a possible nuclear plant siting plan is discussed towards the end of the paper.Guangdong province, which owns the third largest coal-fired power installed capacity out of 31 provinces, generated over 8% of China's total electricity every year for the past 15 years. CO2 storage opportunities could be found in the surrounding South China Sea, where Guangdong has a total of 4,300 km of coastline and some small scale oil fields on shore within the region. It is also among the first places to start the national open and reform policy in China. The province is one of the richest in China, with the highest GDP among all other provinces since 1989, and the foreign trade accounts for more than a quarter of China's total amount. It also contributes around 12% of the total national economic output. Currently, the provincial government is proposing a low carbon roadmap, which is the first of its kind in China.The work has created a totally new thinking on capture ready power plant planning. This differs from existing studies (e. g. [2], [3], [4]), which aim to investigate the existing carbon dioxide emission sources at specified location and provide source and sink matching analysis. Instead the study focuses on policy implementation for new build capture ready power plants. Three clusters within Guangdong province are identified as potential temporary CO2 storage hubs before transporting the gas to a long term storage site. When officials are planning new power plant locations from a capture ready perspective, the plants should not necessarily be close to storage sites in straight line, but rather should be within a reasonable distance of a cluster. Transport of the captured CO2 will not be limited to pipelines, but could be extended to road and rail tankers.Power plant parameters and storage site data were collected for this research. Public transportation, utilities, landscapes, river, land used and population data were referenced from various sources; therefore, some of the data could be out of date. Nevertheless, it should still provide enough information when deciding the location of the transport cluster. Any future work could build on the existing model with updated data. Moreover, it could fit in with the national natural gas transportation network and utility planning network to provide long term integrated energy system analysis.The paper could provide policy makers, investors and urban planning officials with a view on how conventional thermal power plant investment and planning could be optimised, using Carbon Capture Ready designs, to keep the CCS retrofitting option open.

Seasonal dynamics of productivity and resource allocation of a deep-water population of this deciduous, stipitate kelp were studied to understand how blade abscission affects the annual carbon budget. Patterns of growth, metabolism, and carbon storage and mobilization were measured monthly for 1 yr relative to in situ light and temperature, and used to model the annual carbon budget. The resulting carbon budget was used to determine if blade abscission effectively reduced respiratory demand during the winter period of low light availability. Metabolic properties (photosynthesis, photoacclimation, and respiration) were seasonally constant and showed evidence of photoacclimation to this deep, low-light environment. Blades grew between February and July, followed by senescence and sloughing from August to December. Concentrations of laminaran and mannitol increased in the blades from the onset of sloughing in August until just prior to blade abscission in mid-December, suggesting translocation of these carbohydrates may have occurred from the blade to the stipe and holdfast. Carbon budget estimates revealed that scalar irradiance measures overestimated the light available for photosynthesis of these paddle-shaped kelp blades by 50 to 75%. The calculations also revealed that blade retention allowed for the maintenance of positive carbon balance throughout the year. Thus, conservation of the internal carbon reserve for metabolic survival during the low-light period does not appear to be a viable explanation for the deciduous life history of P. gardneri. Abscission may reduce hydrodynamic drag, thus minimizing the probability of dislodgment of entire plants during winter storm events, or promote spore dispersal as abscised blades and sori drift away from the parent holdfast.",,,,,,,,,8,0,0,0,7,0,9,,,0171-8630,1616-1599,,,,,,,,,,"Calif State Univ, Moss Landing Marine Labs, Moss Landing, CA 95039 USA",,,,2006-01-01,WOS:000237020200012,,

This study aimed to recycle the contaminated sediment by assessing the roles and integration of binder formulation, sediment pretreatment, curing method, and waste inclusion in stabilization/solidification. The results demonstrated that the 28-d compressive strength of sediment blocks produced with coal fly ash and lime partially replacing cement at a binder-to-sediment ratio of 3:7 could be used as fill materials for construction. The X-ray diffraction analysis revealed that hydration products (calcium hydroxide) were difficult to form at high sediment content. Thermal pretreatment of sediment removed 90% of indigenous organic matter, significantly increased the compressive strength, and enabled reuse as non-load-bearing masonry units. Besides, 2-h CO2 curing accelerated early-stage carbonation inside the porous structure, sequestered 5.6% of CO2 (by weight) in the sediment blocks, and acquired strength comparable to 7-d curing. Thermogravimetric analysis indicated substantial weight loss corresponding to decomposition of poorly and well crystalline calcium carbonate. Moreover, partial replacement of contaminated sediment by various granular waste materials notably augmented the strength of sediment blocks. The metal leachability of sediment blocks was minimal and acceptable for reuse. These results suggest that contaminated sediment should be viewed as useful resources. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

The monitoring, verification, and accounting (MVA) toolkit offers a suite of technologies to monitor an extensive range of parameters across a wide span of spatial and temporal resolutions, each with their own degree of sensitivity to changes in the parameter being monitored. Understanding how best to optimize MVA budgets to minimize the time to leak detection could help to address issues around project risks, and in turn help support broad CCS deployment. This paper presents a case study demonstrating an application of the Designs for Risk Evaluation and Management (DREAM) tool using an ensemble of CO2 leakage scenarios taken from a previous study on leakage impacts to groundwater. Impacts were assessed and monitored as a function of pH, total dissolved solids (TDS), and trace metal concentrations of arsenic (As), cadmium (Cd), chromium (Cr), and lead (Pb). Using output from the previous study, the DREAM tool was used to optimize monitoring system designs based on variable sampling locations and parameters. The algorithm requires the user to define a finite budget to limit the number of monitoring wells and technologies deployed, and then iterates well placement, sensor type and location until it converges on the configuration with the lowest time to first detection of the leak averaged across all scenarios. To facilitate an understanding of the optimal number of sampling wells, DREAM was used to assess the marginal utility of additional sampling locations. Based on assumptions about monitoring costs and replacement costs of degraded water, the incremental cost of each additional sampling well can be compared against its marginal value in terms of avoided aquifer degradation. Applying this method, DREAM identified the most cost-effective ensemble with 14 monitoring locations. While this preliminary study applied relatively simplistic cost and technology assumptions, it provides an exciting proof-of-concept for the application of DREAM to questions of cost-optimized MVA system design that are informed not only by site-specific costs and technology options, but also by reservoir simulation results developed during site characterization and operation.

However, the ecosystem carbon stocks in the mangroves of India have not been studied comprehensively. Data from this region is very limited for providing sufficient insights and authentic evaluation of carbon stocks on a regional scale. In this study, we evaluated the ecosystem carbon stock and its spatial variation in mangroves of Kerala, southwest coast of India. Results The mean biomass stored in mangrove vegetation of Kerala is 117.11 +/- 1.02 t/ha (ABG= 80.22 +/- 0.80, BGB =36.89 +/- 0.23 t/ha). Six mangrove species were found distributed in the study area. Among the different species,Avicennia marinahad the highest biomass (162.18 t/ha) and least biomass was observed inSonneratia alba(0.61 t/ha). The mean ecosystem carbon stock of mangrove systems in Kerala was estimated to be 139.82 t/ha, equivalent to 513.13 t CO(2)e/ha with the vegetation and soil storing 58.56 t C/ha and 81.26 t C/ha respectively. Conclusion The present study reveals that Kerala mangroves store sizable volume of carbon and therefore need to be preserved and managed sustainably, to retain along with the increase in carbon storage. This features the need of broadening mangrove cover as well as restoring deteriorated land in the past 50 years.

Marine radar could be a valuable tool to augment traditional seabird surveys but the problem of aspect dependency of the generic radar cross section (RCS) of live birds in flight must be understood before radar data is correctly interpreted. A marine radar multiple target tracking algorithm ('GANNET') was applied to data from an un-calibrated, horizontally polarised, 10 kW X-band marine radar sited at the European Marine Energy Centre (EMEC) tidal renewable energy test site, Scotland U.K. From 24 days of data over 1.84 million target readings were recorded. For each target reading the radar aspect angle (bearing of radar beam incident on target), range and non-dimensional echo magnitude were derived allowing a view to be generated of the variation of echo magnitude with aspect angle for all tracked targets. The resulting polar diagram shows a significant change in echo magnitude with range between side-on and head/tail-on aspects indicating a large contribution of the RCS from the wings of birds in flight. The species-unspecific detectability of seabirds, especially at long range, is found to be strongly dependent on aspect angle. This has direct implications for the use of marine radar equipment for avian monitoring at proposed and active marine energy sites and must be taken into account if data from these radars are to be used to augment traditional bird abundance and area use surveys conducted by human observers.

In the past few years increasing attention has focused on the presence and possible impact of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) in produced water. Studies have shown that the concentration of the 16 EPA PAHs can vary from 0.7 to 100s mg/L in produced water. However, particularly on oil platforms, the flaring of produced gas can also be a significant source of PAHs. A study by the Alberta Research Council in 1996 identified many PAHs in the emissions from the flared produced gas (up to 300 mg/m(3) for the 16 EPA PAHs). It is likely that much of the PAHs in the flared emissions will end up in the water and so should be assessed against the produced water input of PAHs. However, it is difficult to compare concentrations in the flared emissions and produced water outfall directly as the dispersion in each media, characteristics of the flare stack and outfall, and meteorological conditions are all factors in mass input into the water. In this study the concentration of PAHs in the emissions was converted to an emission rate and input into an air dispersion model. The maximum ground level concentrations were determined with the model and then converted to a seawater concentration using a simple equilibrium model. The produced water outfall was simulated using CORMIX and the resulting concentrations were compared with the air dispersion model results.",,,,,Oceans 2005 ConferenceOceans 2005 Conference,"SEP 17-23, 2005SEP 17-23, 2005",IEEEIEEE,"Washington, DCWashington, DC",2,0,0,0,1,0,2,,,0197-7385,,0-933957-34-3,,,,,,,,,"Mem Univ Newfoundland, St John, NF A1C 5S7, Canada",,,,2005-01-01,WOS:000238978702055,,

All these aspects should be taken into account in order to assess and compare the real environmental sustainability of the CO2 capture processes.It is well established that life cycle assessment (LCA) represents a powerful tool to evaluate the most significant environmental impacts of CO2 capture technologies throughout their lifetimes.Using LCA methodology, this study aimed to compare life cycle emissions of membrane separation and chemical absorption processes for the post-combustion capture of one tonne of CO2 from a subcritical coal-fired power plant. Environmental impacts were evaluated considering a hybrid approach for the life cycle inventory, combining physical and economic input data.Simulation results highlighted that life cycle emissions of CO2 capture based on membrane separation process were strongly related to membrane material and thickness of the dense active layer, influencing the net power consumption and membrane area requirement. Membrane configurations investigated allowed to reduce to such an extent environmental impacts compared to CO2 capture based on monoethanoalmine (MEA) absorption.

This reduction seems to be related with lianas infestation found at the forest edge.Deforestation in tropical regions is raising fragmentation to alarming levels. Not only does it lead to losses of forest area, but also the abiotic and biotic changes on forest edge areas alter the development of the remaining trees. We aimed to assess the impacts of forest fragmentation on the growth of tropical emergent trees. We sampled the endangered species Aspidosperma polyneuron (Apocynaceae) at forest edge and interior in the highly fragmented Brazilian Atlantic Forest. We obtained increment cores of each tree along with data about tree and surrounding canopy heights, plus their current levels of liana infestation. We used tree-ring analyses to estimate age and growth rate of trees. Sampled trees and surrounding canopy were taller at the forest interior than at the edge, even though both sampled populations have similar ages. Overall, trees at forest interior show a lifetime growth pattern common to shade-tolerant species, with a peak of growth rate at 120 years. Indeed, all sampled trees exhibited this pattern before fragmentation. However, trees at forest edge presented constantly slow growth rates for all diameter classes after the fragmentation event. The strong presence of lianas at forest edge prevents trees from experiencing the expected growth releases throughout their lifetime, probably by keeping the leaves of A. polyneuron under shaded conditions. Therefore, the management of lianas at the forest edge is likely the most effective procedure to ensure the growth of emergent trees, guarantying their role on forests structure, carbon storage, and ecosystem functioning.",,,,,,,,,13,0,0,0,12,1,14,,,0931-1890,1432-2285,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Sao Paulo, Inst Biosci, Dept Bot, Rua Matao 277, BR-05508090 Sao Paulo, BrazilUniv Passau, Dept Phys Geog, Innstr 40, D-94032 Passau, Germany",,,,2018-12-28,WOS:000438795300011,,

The operating envelope for flexible riser configurations has continually expanded to meet the challenges of both shallow and deep water applications [1]. This paper presents recent innovations in technology for flexible riser solutions to enable oil and gas development in water depths as low as 20m with required system reliability as well as cost effectiveness.For shallow water applications, the traditional technology is the wave or S configuration. S configurations require a structure such as a mid-water buoyancy arch (MWA) to support the riser configuration, which increases the cost of both fabrication and installation. The wave configuration with distributed buoyancy is a more cost-effective approach in terms of installation The disadvantage of this solution is that the riser could either float to the water surface or sink to the seabed when its content density varies or the floating production, storage and offloading vessel (FPSO) deviates from its nominal mooring position during field production. A new modified wave configuration, referred to as the Weight Added Wave (WAW) configuration (Patent pending) is presented, which enjoys the low installation cost of the wave configuration and performance reliability of the S riser configuration.The WAW configuration has been applied to two FPSO shallow water field developments and the results are presented herein to confirm the solution for real life applications.",,,,,"28th International Conference on Ocean, Offshore and Arctic Engineering28th International Conference on Ocean, Offshore and Arctic Engineering","MAY 31-JUN 05, 2009MAY 31-JUN 05, 2009","ASME, Ocean, Offshore & Arctic Engn DivASME, Ocean, Offshore & Arctic Engn Div","Honolulu, HIHonolulu, HI",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,978-0-7918-4343-7,,,,,,,,,,,,,2009-01-01,WOS:000282993000040,,

The DH5R gas originates from the organic-rich units of the mudstone-dominated Middle Jurassic to Lower Cretaceous Agardhfjellet Formation, which is the onshore equivalent to the Fuglen Formation and the prolific oil and gas generating Hekkingen Formation in the southern Barents Shelf. Low-permeable, low-porosity sandstones from the Upper Triassic De Geerdalen Formation of the neighbouring DH4 well were oil-stained and gas was also collected from this interval. Gas from the two stratigraphic intervals have different compositions; the gas from the Agardhfjellet Formation is drier and isotopically heavier than the gas from the Upper Triassic succession. Both gases originated from source rocks of maturity near the end of the oil window (1.1 < Ro < 1.4% Ro). Maceral analyses of the Agardhfjellet Formation indicate that the more silty parts contain a high percentage of vitrinite-rich type III kerogen, whereas the clay-dominated parts are rich in liptinitic type II kerogen. The Agardhfjellet Formation has therefore the potential to generate both oil and gas. Several simulations based on pressure data and flow rates from the DH5R well were run to evaluate if the gas accumulation in the Agardhfjellet Formation is producible, i.e., can it be commercial shale gas. The models demonstrate how changes in the drainage area size and form, well types (vertical versus horizontal), number and length of induced fractures and thickness of the Agardhfjellet Formation affect gas production rates and producible volumes. Despite uncertainties in the input data, simulations indicate that the shale gas accumulation characterised in Adventdalen is producible.

We studied the impact from a coastal windfarm on the breeding success of white-tailed eagles (Haliaeetus albicilla) at Smola, western Norway by means of a BACI (before-after-control-impact) approach. The objective was to compare pre- and post-construction breeding success. A 10 year dataset from 47 eagle territories were analyzed using a generalized linear mixed model. Successful breeding was used as a response variable, while distance to turbines, distance to roads and before/after turbine construction were used as predictors. There was a significant effect of the interaction between time period and distance to turbines, showing that territories within 500 m from the turbines in the post-construction period experienced significantly lower breeding success than the same territories before construction. We found that this effect was most likely due to territories being vacated. The results emphasize the importance of using a BACI approach when assessing possible effects from wind-power production on breeding birds, especially for species breeding at low densities. It also emphasizes the importance of conducting thorough pre-construction studies on vulnerable bird species. (c) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

This review article highlights the knowledge gap in identifying the different sources of waste streams in combined drilling waste. This paper also emphasises how different chemicals turn into environmentally significant pollutants after serving great performance in oil and gas drilling operations. For instance, oil based drilling fluid performs excellent in deeper drilling and drilling in harsh geological conditions, but ended with (produces) a significant amount of persistent toxic pollutants in the environment.

The canal is directly connected to Europe's second largest river, the Danube, which drains its water into the Black Sea. Perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) up to 5.7 ng d(-1) weight (dw) and total Perfluorinated compounds (PFCs) up to 6.3 ng g(-1) dw were detected. Compared to other reports, high levels of PFOS were found, even though PFCs are not used in the industrial production associated with this canal. The PFOS concentration in water was recalculated using the adsorption coefficient, K-oc from literature. Using the average output of wastewater from the canal, a mass load of 1.38 kg PFOS per year discharged in the Danube River has been calculated, which undoubtedly points to the contribution to global persistent organic pollution of surface waters originating from this industrial place.

Recent top-down studies based on observations showed CH4 emissions in California's South Coast Air Basin (SoCAB) were greater than those expected from population-apportioned bottom-up state inventories. In this study, we quantify CH4 emissions with an advanced mesoscale inverse modeling system at a resolution of 8kmx8km, using aircraft measurements in the SoCAB during the 2010 Nexus of Air Quality and Climate Change campaign to constrain the inversion. To simulate atmospheric transport, we use the FLEXible PARTicle-Weather Research and Forecasting (FLEXPART-WRF) Lagrangian particle dispersion model driven by three configurations of the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) mesoscale model. We determine surface fluxes of CH4 using a Bayesian least squares method in a four-dimensional inversion. Simulated CH4 concentrations with the posterior emission inventory achieve much better correlations with the measurements (R-2=0.7) than using the prior inventory (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's National Emission Inventory 2005, R-2=0.5). The emission estimates for CH4 in the posterior, 46.39.2 Mg CH4/h, are consistent with published observation-based estimates. Changes in the spatial distribution of CH4 emissions in the SoCAB between the prior and posterior inventories are discussed. Missing or underestimated emissions from dairies, the oil/gas system, and landfills in the SoCAB seem to explain the differences between the prior and posterior inventories. We estimate that dairies contributed 5.91.7 Mg CH4/h and the two sectors of oil and gas industries (production and downstream) and landfills together contributed 39.68.1 Mg CH4/h in the SoCAB.",,,,,,,,,36,0,0,0,11,0,38,,,2169-897X,2169-8996,,,,,,,,,,"NOAA, Div Chem Sci, Earth Syst Res Lab, Boulder, CO 80305 USAUniv Colorado, Cooperat Inst Res Environm Sci, Boulder, CO 80309 USACNRS Meteo France Univ La Reunion, Lab Atmosphere & Cyclones, UMR8105, St Denis, Reunion, FranceUniv Colorado, Dept Mech Engn, Boulder, CO 80309 USASandia Natl Labs, Livermore, CA USAHarvard Univ, Dept Earth & Planetary Sci, Cambridge, MA 02138 USAUniv Michigan, Dept Atmospher Ocean & Space Sci, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USAUniv Calif Berkeley, Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Environm Energy Technol Div, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA",,,,2015-07-16,WOS:000358695200024,,

The strategy described here is dedicated to model wave propagating from air guns in offshore geophysical surveys applied to oil and gas industry. The model is formed by two distinct regions, i.e., a homogeneous (water) and a heterogeneous (sediment) one. For the geophysical applications considered here, the integrals of the BEM formulation can be simplified so that the final expressions allow one to calculate the wavefield in the homogeneous region, at any time, without needing to march on time through a time-stepping algorithm. Thus, this wavefield can be used to initialize any numerical method employed to propagate the pressure field throughout the model; in this work, the finite difference method (FDM) is the numerical method considered. The final integral equations for two- and three-dimensional problems are presented. An assessment of the accuracy of the results obtained by the strategy proposed here is provided at the end of this work, through the analysis of three examples. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

The palms were first introduced as foreign species to curb coastal erosion over a century ago (i.e. 1906). They later became invasive and started multiplying in the last 30 years. The palms have acclimatized to the coastal environment by developing superior root system, which they use to tap available nutrients. They also have tough and buoyant seeds, which aid in their wide dispersal. These qualities of the palms had made them to have an edge over the mangroves. Oil and gas exploration, which is responsible for numerous oil spillages, is a major cause of mangrove decimation. The establishment of open waste disposal sites in coastal areas have also contributed to the changes in soil and water qualities, leading to further decline in mangroves, with a resultant increase in invasive nypa palms. The palms change the pedology, hydrology and landscape architecture of the coastal environment once they are established. Therefore, a threat to the mangroves is a threat to the entire coastal system, which benefits from the ecosystem services provided by the mangroves. Mangroves may disappear completely from the Niger Delta in the next 50 years if the encroachment of the palms continue unabated. However, this problem can be resolved by the removal of the palms through mechanical, physical or chemical means. Soils on which the palms grow can be excavated to remove the allelopathic properties, after which the palm soil should be replaced with mangrove soil. To ensure smooth re-colonization of the coast, mangroves propagules with good genetic quality should be selected, nurtured and transplanted from the nursery to the coastal areas. The mangrove propagules should be monitored and protected from further invasion by nypa palm after planting.",,,,,,,,,3,0,0,0,2,0,4,,,2211-0577,2211-0585,978-3-319-91382-7; 978-3-319-91381-0,,,,,,,,,"Univ Port Harcourt, Dept Anim & Environm Biol, Choba, Nigeria",,,,2019-04-18,WOS:000463590800014,,

Oil and natural gas releases in deep water behave much differently than in shallow water. This is primarily because of the density stratification, high pressures, and low temperatures found in deep water. Some physical and chemical changes that occur in deepwater environments may significantly reduce the buoyancy of the plume and keep large amounts of the oil submerged for an extended time. This has significant implications for environmental impact assessment, oil-spill cleanup, contingency planning, and source tracing.The Minerals Management Service (MMS) performs an oil-spill risk analysis (OSRA) to estimate the probability of oil spills occurring and the risks of contact to environment resources. The Clarkson Deepwater Oil and Gas Blowout Model (CDOG model) is a jet/plume model that simulates the behavior of oil and gas accidentally released in deepwater areas. The OSRA model and the CDOG model are used to estimate the contact of deepwater oil spills to the environmental resources. Real-time current data from Acoustic Doppler Current Profilers (ADCP's) deployed on offshore platforms are used to drive the models.Preliminary results indicate that the OSRA model and the CDOG model can provide important information on the behavior of oil spills in the deep water.

It is applied to 301 spills in European waters between 1970 and 2014 for 429 Eurostat territorial units and 156 regions in Europe's coasts. The results show a high heterogeneity among European coastal regions with areas, predominantly on the Atlantic coast, with high marine-spill risks. In particular, UK coasts are markedly affected as there are only five non-British coastal territories within the first 25 territorial units most at risk from marine spills. Across countries, European Atlantic countries face highest risks versus coastal countries on other European waters that are relatively safer. The index also shows a tendency of sea currents to have positive dispersal effects leading to smaller risks rather than otherwise. The index may help to design protection policies and reduce the vulnerability of sensitive resources. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Increasingly hostile environments involving deep offshore wells, higher pressure and temperature conditions, sour wells etc are encountered during exploration/development. This necessitates use of construction materials with high strength and resistance to corrosion in the severe conditions associated with production/refining. Superalloy grades such as 825, 625 and 718 have been deployed with success to meet these challenges. Technology to produce various millforms/critical components of superalloy grade 718 for aeronautical applications has been established in India. Work has also been carried out in the Country to develop superalloy grades 825 and 625 with no specific reference, however, to petrochemical applications.The high strength nickel-base superalloy grades 686 and 725 have proved to be excellent candidate materials for a variety of marine applications - fasteners, springs etc. The Ni-base superalloy grade C276, exhibiting excellent corrosion resistance to seawater especially under crevice corrosion conditions, is similar to superalloy grade 686. Superalloy grade C276 has been successfully produced in India in different millforms.The paper gives an overview of the development work done in India on superalloy grades 718, 625, 825 and C276 and prospects of using these materials in petrochemical and marine sectors in the country.",,,,,,,,,4,1,0,0,0,0,5,,,0972-2815,0975-1645,,,,,,,,,,"Natl Inst Technol Warangal, Dept Met & Mat Engn, Warangal 506021, Andhra Pradesh, India",,,,2008-04-01,WOS:000208029700004,,

This oil shale belt has a vast worldwide extension, and it is considered as major oil-and gas-prone source rock in many places, especially in the Middle East. The sedimentation of the oil shale was triggered by the major transgression event that occurred during the Late Cretaceous. The lithology, type of kerogen, organic richness, and thickness of these organic-rich sediments vary markedly both on lateral and vertical scales. In Quseir area, the in-place geological reserves, of oil shale of the 800-kcal/kg quality, is estimated to be more than 9 billion tons that can produce 5.48 bbls equivalent upon retorting. Very optimistic resources are expected in the unexplored Nile Valley region. The factor analysis of data rank representing 1176 core samples and analysis of 58 major and trace elements besides Rock-Eval analyses point to five main controlling factors that control deposition of oil shale. The terrestrial indicators Al2O3, TiO2, Fe2O3, and K2O and the marine indicators Ca and Sr are oppositely loaded in the first factor. The second factor expresses the reducing conditions that prevailed during the deposition of the organic-rich marine environments. The euxinity of the basin is recognized by the third factor where sulfide and vanadium seem to be mutual. The fourth factor expresses the role of dolomitization while the fifth factor points to the humble role of oxidation. Considering the metric core samples, the highest TOC content recorded in the borehole drilled in Abu Tartur plateau is 3.6%, but it is about 14% for Quseir area. Regarding the spot samples in Quseir area, the highest TOC measured about 24%. It is not only the low TOC in Abu Tartur but also the kerogen type that is of type II + III, mostly of terrestrial origin (gas-prone) and lithology dominated by argillites. Organic richness is remarkable in Quseir-Safaga area, where the average TOC of 160-m-thick sequence is about 5%, with kerogen of type I or mixed I + II, mostly of marine origin (oil prone). The Dakhla Formation (Maastrichtian-Danian) is the richest in organic matter while Quseir Formation (Campanian) has the least organic richness and lowest kerogen quality. Detailed investigation on biomarkers confirms the relations among transgression, organic richness, kerogen type, and anoxic conditions. The organic matter is immature as witnessed by the low S1 values (<5%, in average), the low T-max (<430 degrees C), the low vitrinite reflectance (<0.4%), and biomarker signature. The variation in the S1 values between 1 and 9% is attributed to the influence of tectonics associating the Red Sea rift. In Quseir-Safaga area, there are particular prolific horizons of oil shale that seem to be visible for utilization by different technologies of combustion and retorting. The content of the heavy metals and uranium, as well as the spent, is a significant benefit. The faulting, dragging, and steep tilting of beds in the Quseir-Safaga area shall remain a serious challenge for extensive utilization of the estimated in-place geological reserves.",,,,,,,,,5,0,0,0,0,0,5,,,1866-7511,1866-7538,,,,,,,,,,"Cairo Univ, Dept Geol, Fac Sci, Giza, Egypt",,,,2017-11-19,WOS:000413203600023,,

A small mishap under such conditions can quickly escalate into a catastrophe. Among all the accidental process-related events occurring offshore, fire is the most frequently reported. It is, therefore, necessary to study the behavior of fires and quantity the hazards posed by them in order to complete a detailed quantitative risk assessment. While there are many consequence models available to predict fire hazards-varying from point source models to highly complex computational fluid dynamic models-only a few have been validated for the unique conditions found offshore.In this paper, we have considered fire consequence modeling as a suite of sub-models such as individual fire models, radiation model, overpressure model, smoke and toxicity models and human impact models. This comprehensive suite of models was then revised by making the following modifications: (i)fire models: existing fire models have been reviewed and the ones most suitable for offshore conditions were selected: (ii) overpressure impact model: a model has been developed to quantify the overpressure effects from fires to investigate the possible damage from the hot combustion gases released in highly confined compartments; (iii) radiation model: instead of a point/area model. a multipoint arid-based model has been adopted for better modeling and analysis of radiation heat flux consequences. A comparison of the performance of the revised models with the ones used in a commercial software package for offshore risk assessment was also carried out and is discussed in the paper.

The probable energy resources, which are likely to fill the gap are nuclear energy, coal bed methane, coal gasification/liquefaction, gas hydrates and hydrogen. Presently, the share of nuclear energy is insignificant in the energy basket contributing only 6% at the world level and about 2% in India. With the estimated large quantity of coal reserve all over the globe, efforts are being made to evaluate and extract methane trapped in coal beds and workout efficient use of coal through its liquefaction and gasification.Gas hydrates with immense resource potential is being considered as a viable alternative to overcome the present oil and gas demand-supply crunch. It is estimated that gas hydrates can provide 50% of organic carbon of the earth or twice the energy resource when compared to the conventional form of energy. Current estimates of gas in gas hydrate accumulations in the world's marine and permafrost appear relatively well constrained and are expected to be in the order of about 20,000 trillion m(3). Initial estimates of amount of gas in the identified gas hydrate locations on the continental margins of India are likely to attain a figure of 2000 trillion m(3). The advantage of gas hydrates holding vast quantity of methane gas as reserve makes this form of hydrocarbons lucrative for exploration and exploitation.In this article, I briefly present the conventional oil and gas scenario and describe seismic methods, which are commonly used to identify presence of gas hydrates in the region of investigation.",,,,,,,,,7,1,0,0,0,0,8,,,0011-3891,,,,,,,,,,,"Natl Geophys Res Inst, Hyderabad 500606, Andhra Pradesh, India",,,,2010-07-25,WOS:000280484500015,,

One such system is the Preline S-CCS, a floating raceway system that pumps water from 35 m depth creating a constant current through the system. Exposing fish to moderate water currents is considered aerobic exercise and it is often perceived as positive for fish welfare, growth, food utilization, muscle development and cardiac health. The present study compared fish reared in the Preline S-CCS and in a reference open pen. Samples were taken in fresh water before being transferred to the seawater systems and after 1, 2 and 4 months in seawater and analysed for growth, mortality, muscle development and plasma insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) levels. Moreover, gene transcription were determined in the skeletal muscle [igf-I, insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor a (igf1ra) and insulin-like growth factor 1 binding protein 1a (igf1bp1a)] and cardiac transcription factors [myocyte-specific enhancer factor 2C (mef2c), gata4 and vascular endothelial growth factor (vegf)]. While the results suggest that post-smolts in Preline S-CCS were smaller than reference fish, fish from Preline S-CCS have less accumulated mortality at the end of the experiment and showed 2.44 times more small muscle fibres than the reference group fish after 4 months in seawater. These results confirmed what was previously observed in the second generation of Preline. Similar levels of big muscle fibres between Preline S-CCS and reference suggest a similar hypertrophy of muscle fibres even with lower IGF-I expression in the Preline S-CCS. Cardiac gene transcription suggests cardiac hypertrophy was observed after 4 months in seawater in the Preline S-CCS group. Altogether, Preline S-CCS is a promising technology able to produce more robust S. salar with a faster growth and lower mortality in the subsequent standard open cage system growth period.",,,,,10th International Workshop on Salmon Smoltification10th International Workshop on Salmon Smoltification,"AUG 14-18, 2017AUG 14-18, 2017",,"Univ Bergen, Bergen, NORWAYUniv Bergen, Bergen, NORWAY",9,2,0,0,8,0,11,,,0022-1112,1095-8649,,,,,,,,,,"Uni Res AS, Uni Res Environm, Nygardsgaten 112, N-5008 Bergen, NorwayHokkaido Univ, Fac Fisheries Sci, Hakodate, Hokkaido, JapanLeroy Seafood Grp ASA, Bergen, NorwayUniv Bergen, Dept Biol, Bergen, Norway",Leroy Seafood Grp ASA,,,2018-10-11,WOS:000445730700016,29952001,

Despite the rising interest in coastal blue carbon, the effects of chronic nutrient enrichment on blue carbon processes have rarely been measured in the context of experimental fertilization. Here, we examined the ecosystem-level effects of nitrate (NO3-) enrichment on the greenhouse gas dynamics of a Spartina alterniflora-dominated salt marsh. We measured CO2 and CH4 fluxes using static chambers through two growing seasons in a salt marsh that was nitrogen-enriched for 13 years and compared fluxes to those from a reference marsh. Outcomes: We found that nitrogen enrichment increased gross primary productivity (GPP) by 7.7% and increased ecosystem respiration (R-eco) by 20.8%. However, nitrogen enrichment had no discernible effect on net ecosystem exchange (NEE). Taken together, these results suggest that nitrogen-induced stimulation of R-eco could transform this salt marsh from a carbon sink into a source of carbon to the atmosphere. Conclusion: Our results complement prior findings of nitrogen enrichment weakening soil structure and organic matter stability in tidal salt marshes, suggesting that increased nutrient inputs have the potential to alter the carbon storage function of these ecosystems through enhanced microbial respiration of previously sequestered carbon.",,,,,,,,,13,2,0,0,4,0,18,,,2096-4129,2332-8878,,,,,,,,,,"Bryn Mawr Coll, Dept Biol, Bryn Mawr, PA 19010 USAVillanova Univ, Dept Biol, 800 Lancaster Ave, Villanova, PA 19085 USATemple Univ, Dept Landscape Architecture & Hort, 580 Meetinghouse Rd, Ambler, PA 19002 USA",,,,2019-10-11,WOS:000451562500003,,

Our aim was to use an integrative approach to elucidate mechanistic relationships of carbon storage with biotic and abiotic factors in the natural forests of temperate Australia, a region that has been overlooked in global analyses of carbon-biodiversity relations.Location South-eastern Australia.Time period 2010-2015.Major taxa studied Forest trees in 732 plots.Methods We used the most comprehensive forest inventory database available for south-eastern Australia and structural equation models to assess carbon-storage relationships with biotic factors (species or functional diversity, community-weighted mean (CWM) trait values, structural diversity) and abiotic factors (climate, soil, fire history). To assess the consistency of relationships at different environmental scales, our analyses involved three levels of data aggregation: six forest types, two forest groups (representing different growth environments), and all forests combined.Results Structural diversity was consistently the strongest independent predictor of carbon storage at all levels of data aggregation, whereas relationships with species- and functional-diversity indices were comparatively weak. CWMs of maximum height and wood density were also significant independent predictors of carbon storage in most cases. In comparison, climate, soil, and fire history had only minor and mainly indirect effects via biotic factors on carbon storage.Main conclusions Our results indicate that carbon storage in our temperate forests was underpinned by tree structural diversity (representing efficient utilisation of space) and by CWM trait values (representing selection effects) more so than by tree species richness or functional diversity. Abiotic effects were comparatively weak and mostly indirect via biotic factors irrespective of the environmental range.

In the near future, natural gas is expected to replace crude oil as the fuel of choice for energy production and transportation. In Trinidad and Tobago, natural-gas production has already surpassed crude-oil production. Natural gas accounts for 80% of the country's energy export, but the reserves-to-production ratio is only 7 years (year 2022). Consequently, the Ministry of Energy has taken steps to supplement the natural-gas resource base by supporting initiatives that can potentially bolster the nation's proven gas reserves. Such initiatives include invitations to tender on deepwater blocks offshore Trinidad and Tobago's gas-rich east coast.Even though initiatives are under way to boost conventional natural-gas reserves, effort was not placed on identifying and/or characterizing unconventional gas resources such as natural-gas hydrates.

Extra-basinal clastic supply and intra-basinal autochthonous deposits have been differentiated, appearing laterally inter-fingered and/or interbedded. The main clastic petrofacies consist of calcarenites, sub-litharenites, quartzarenites, sub-arkoses, and polygenic conglomerates derived from extra-basinal margins. An alternate internal and external provenance of the different supplies is the result of the paleogeographic re-organization of the basin/margins system due to tectonic activation and exhumation of rising areas. The intra-basinal deposits consist of black shales and siliceous sediments (silexites and cherty beds), evidencing major environmental changes in the Moldavidian Basin. Organic-matter-rich black shales were deposited during anoxic episodes related to sediment starvation and high nutrient influx due to paleogeographic isolation of the basin caused by plate drifting. The black shales display relatively high contents in sub-mature to mature, Type II lipidic organic matter (good oil and gas-prone source rocks) constituting a potentially active petroleum system. The intra-basinal siliceous sediments are related to oxic pelagic or hemipelagic environments under tectonic quiescence conditions although its increase in the Oligocene part of the succession can be correlated with volcanic supplies. The integration of all the data in the progressive reorientation of convergence direction Carpathian model, and their consideration in the framework of a foreland basin, led to propose some constrains on the paleogeographic-geodynamic evolutionary model of the Moldavidian Basin from the Late Cretaceous to the Burdigalian.",,,,,,,,,21,0,0,0,6,0,21,,,1437-3254,1437-3262,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Alicante, Dept Ciencias Tierra & Medio Ambiente, E-03080 Alicante, SpainUniv Urbino Carlo Bo, Dipartimento Matemat Fis & Informat, I-61029 Urbino, ItalyUniv Tunis, Dept Geol, Tunis 2092, TunisiaUniv Urbino Carlo Bo, Dipartimento Sci Terra Vita & Ambiente DiSTeVA, I-61029 Urbino, ItalyAlexandru Ioan Cuza Univ, Dept Geol, Iasi 700505, Romania",,,,2012-09-12,WOS:000307538600009,,

Hemocytes in clams from the polluted sites also displayed less DNA damage and mortality than in the control site, possibly due to a faster phagocytosis of the impaired cells. Glycogen, the major energetic reserve, was depleted in clams from the spilled sites, potentially due to energetic consumption for maintenance of a large pool of granulocytes, detoxification processes and oxidative stress.

Offshore activity in these areas is challenging. Arctic-specific environmental conditions, long distances from onshore facilities and general lack of infrastructure are some of the challenges faced. Therefore, new and more robust solutions both on technological and operational side are required before commencing operations safely in these areas.In this paper, a helicopter emergency response capacity with respect to prevailing wind conditions for operations in the Barents Sea is studied and a method for mapping the rescue capacity in the given area is presented. The goal is to develop a method capable of assessing the probability of a successful rescue at different locations within given time requirements and under prevailing wind conditions. This is accomplished using a simulation model capable to determine how the wind speed and direction affect the search and rescue helicopter operations in the Barents Sea.The simulation model uses historical wind data along a potential route as input for evaluating the flying time to different locations in an area under the given wind conditions. In addition to the wind conditions, the variation in recovery time, and mobilisation time is implemented into the simulation model. By running the simulation model multiple times, probability distributions of the number of personnel which can be recovered within the given time requirements are established. This information is then used to plot isocurves of equal rescue probability on top of a map of the Barents Sea.Based on the results, it is concluded that wind conditions have significant effect on rescue capacity of a helicopter, and thus thorough weather observations should be made before establishing a search and rescue system for a given area.",,,,,"35th ASME International Conference on Ocean, Offshore and Arctic Engineering35th ASME International Conference on Ocean, Offshore and Arctic Engineering","JUN 19-24, 2016JUN 19-24, 2016","ASME, Ocean Offshore & Arctic Engn DivASME, Ocean Offshore & Arctic Engn Div","Busan, SOUTH KOREABusan, SOUTH KOREA",1,0,0,0,0,0,1,,,,,978-0-7918-4999-6,,,,,,,,,"NTNU, Dept Marine Technol, Trondheim, NorwayTUHH, Hamburg, Germany",,,,2017-03-01,WOS:000393091100024,,

In order to come up with useful recommendations, we evaluated various approaches of beached bird collection at the Belgian coast during seven winters (1993-1999). Data received in a passive way by one major rehabilitation centre were compared to the results of targeted beach surveys carried out at different scales by trained ornithologists: 'weekly' surveys - with a mean interval of 9 days - restricted to a fixed 16.7 km beach stretch, 'monthly' surveys over the entire coastline (62.1 km) and an annual 'international' survey in Belgium over the same distance at the end of February. Data collected through Belgian rehabilitation centres concern injured, living birds collected in a non-systematical way. Oil rates derived from these centres appear to be strongly biased to oiled auks and inshore bird species, and are hence of little use in assessing the extent of oil pollution at sea. The major asset of rehabilitation centres in terms of data collection seems to be their continuous warning function for events of mass mortality. Weekly surveys on a representative and large enough section rendered reliable data on oil rates, estimates of total number of bird victims, representation of various taxonomic groups and species-richness and were most sensitive in detecting events quickly (wrecks, oil-slicks, severe winter mortality, etc.). Monthly surveys gave comparable results, although they overlooked some important beaching events and demonstrated slightly higher oil rates, probably due to the higher chance to miss short-lasting wrecks of auks. Since the monthly surveys in Belgium were carried out by a network of volunteers and were spread over a larger beach section, they should be considered as best performing. Single 'international beached bird surveys' in February gave reliable data on total victim number (once the mean ratio between numbers in various months is known) and oil rate (provided a sufficiently large sample can be collected), but failed in tracking events. It is a particularly attractive approach because of its long tradition, resulting in invaluable long-term databases, and the uniformity in which these surveys are organised on a large scale. The minimal distance for a monthly survey amounts to 25-30 km (40-50% of Belgian coastline) up to 40 km (65%) in order to attain sound figures for oil rate and species-richness, respectively. These distances are primarily determined by the number of bird corpses that may be collected and are hence a function of beaching intensity and corpse detection rate. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

A reduced levelised cost of energy will ensure thatSME will be able to deliver profitable projects at a community scale (3MW). SME hasidentified that by removing the pull down system and hydraulics from the platform this can beachieved. The prototype platform, 100kW PLATO #1, has these mounted on the platform butthey can be susceptible to corrosion and marine growth due to the platform being submergedfor long periods of time (up to 11 months in between servicing). The pull down system andhydraulics are only used for the installation and retrieval of PLAT-O so, therefore, they areredundant whilst the platform is operational subsea. In order to reduce the capex and opex, asolution is to remove the parts completely from the platform and deploy them only whennecessary. This can be achieved by SME designing and building a Surface SuppliedInstallation System (SISS) to facilitate the installation/retrieval of SME’s commercialdemonstrator platform, 250kW PLAT-O #2. By using a SSIS to install/retrieve PLAT-O theutilisation of the equipment will be increased as it will be used for multiple platforms. TheSISS will not be affected by corrosion or marine growth because it will only be submergedduring marine operations. By doing this, SME will reduce the capital cost per platform andthe operational cost by reducing the maintenance costs which would be incurred servicing thepull down system and hydraulics. The capital cost of each platform will be reduced by£150,000; over a community-scale project (an array of 12 platforms) this equates to areduction of £1.8m out of a total cost of £14.4m.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,720787,,,,,,,,Sustainable Marine Energy Limited,Sustainable Marine Energy Limited,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:15296099,,

Here we present a multi-objective optimization model for intermediate-term planning of HCSC. The model brings forward sustainability and the environment aspect of planning HCSC operations. Sustainability is considered as an objective by minimizing the depletion rate. The environment is considered as a constraint in the model by restricting CO2 release. In addition, the model includes minimizing the total cost and maximizing revenue as two objectives. The proposed model assists decision makers to study trade-offs among alternative decisions. Decisions have an impact on meeting demand, depletion rate of natural resources, minimizing costs and/or maximizing revenue. A case study based on real data is provided to demonstrate model practicability and a sensitivity analysis is conducted to derive managerial insights. For instance, oil and gas reserves can be sustained for a longer period without the reduction of market share and simultaneously, return covers the total cost. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

This paper explores one of the dominating energy companies in Europe, Statoil, and its strategic decisions that determine which type of energy technology multinational corporations choose to invest in or to acquire. The author develops the concept of two different paths to investigate the company's role within this context. The black energy path implies continued production of hydrocarbons and investment in more advanced technology to create economic output for Statoil. By contrast, diversifying into the green energy path has the potential to close the gap between the black and green path, step-by-step. The author discusses Statoil's decisions that have an environmental objective. He concludes that despite new initiatives having been taken to close the gap between Statoil's fossil and renewable energy paths within offshore wind and carbon capture and storage, as well as the new and upcoming gas projects in the company's portfolio, the company is highly path-dependent on the black carbon path and is prolonging its corporate strategy towards increased oil and gas investments.",,,,,,,,,14,0,0,0,0,0,14,,,2214-6296,2214-6326,,,,,,,,,,"Northern Res Inst Norway NORUT, PB 6434, N-9294 Tromso, Norway",Northern Res Inst Norway NORUT,,,2017-08-04,WOS:000405725500007,,

Intermittent discharge of oil from the stricken tanker, combined with large-scale sea surface dispersion, created a tracking and recovery problem. Initially, conventional oil recovery approaches were adopted, close to the wreck. With time and distance from the source, the oil dispersed dramatically and became less viscous. Consequently, a unique monitoring, prediction and data dissemination system was established, based upon the principles of 'operational oceanography'; this utilised in situ tracked buoys and numerical (spill trajectory) modelling outputs, in combination with remote sensing (satellite sensors and visual observation). Overall, wind effects on the surface waters were found to be the most important mechanism controlling the smaller oil slick movements. The recovery operation involved up to 180 fishing boats, 9-30 m in length. Such labour-intensive recovery of the oil (21,000 tonnes, representing an unprecedented ratio of 6.6 tonnes at sea, per tonne recovered on land) continued over a 10 month period. The overall recovery at sea, by the fishing vessels, represented 63% of the total oil recovered at sea; this compares to only 37% recovered by specialised 'counter-pollution' vessels.

Alternatives for treatment and final disposal of these residues are available, with performance differing in multiple aspects, each impacting overall sustainability of existing technologies. Although procedures for comparing sustainability of processes are not new, for end-of-pipe technologies the common approach in the literature is the use of indicators that express the benefit of adding a waste management step. In this scenario, the work presents a methodology for sustainability analysis of solid waste management, adapted to specificities of drill cuttings, illustrated by a case study in the offshore Brazilian pre-salt area. Performance of a given technology is evaluated by integrating environmental, economic, safety and technical aspects in an original multi-criteria analysis. The evaluated waste management technologies are: offshore discharge, onshore disposal, offshore cuttings re-injection and microwave treatment followed by onshore disposal. Process inventories are compiled and support calculation of the proposed Sustainability Degree index for ranking of alternatives, which points to offshore discharge as the most sustainable among the evaluated technologies, followed by Microwave Treatment, Onshore Disposal and Offshore Re-injection. The methodology can indicate opportunities for technical optimization and contribute to the decision-making process on drilling waste management. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Core and cuttings samples from two wells that penetrated the same fault about 300 m apart show markedly different thermal histories and evidence for mass flux. Sediments within and adjacent to the fault zone in the U.S. Department of Energy-Pennzoil Pathfinder well at about 2200 m SSTVD (subsea true vertical depth) showed little paleothermal or geochemical evidence for through-going fluid flow, The sediments were characterized by loss vitrinite reflectances (R-o), averaging 0.3% R-o, moderate to high delta(18)O and delta(13)C values, and little difference in major or trace element composition between deformed and undeformed sediments. In contrast, faulted sediments from the A6ST well, which intersects the A fault at 1993 m SSTVD, show evidence for a paleothermal anomaly (0.55% R-o) and depleted delta(18)O and delta(13)C values. Sodium is depleted and calcium is enriched in a mudstone gouge zone at the top of the fault cut in the yell; this effect diminishes with distance from this gouge zone, Cuttings from other wells in South Eugene Island Block 330 show slightly elevated vitrinite reflectance in fault intercepts relative to sediments outside the fault zone, Overall, indicators of mass and heat flux indicate the main growth fault zone in South Eugene Island Block 330 has acted as a conduit fur ascending fluids, although the cumulative fluxes vary along strike, This conclusion is corroborated by oil and gas distribution in downthrown sands in Blocks 330 and 331, which identify the fault system in northwestern Block 330 as a major feeder.Simple modeling of coupled heat and mass flux indicates the paleothermal anomaly in the fault tone intersected by A6ST well was short-lived, having a duration less than 150 yr. The anomaly could have been produced by a 2 x 10(6) m(3) pulse of fluid ascending the fault at an actual velocity of over 1 km/yr (Darcy flux of 330 m/yr) from 3 km deeper in the basin. Simple Darcy law computation indicates a transient fault permeability on the order of 110 md during this flow. Pulsing of fluid up the fault was probably the norm, although most flow did not produce such strong thermal anomalies as the one detected in the A6ST well,Analysis of fluid pressures shows that the main fault is a profound lateral permeability barrier having up to 1800 psi of water pressure differential across it. The hydrocarbon sealing capacity of the fault depends on the pressure difference across the fault. Fault permeability is best understood in terms of effective stress. Under ambient conditions, the fault is at high pressure relative to downthrown reservoirs. A pulse of high-pressure fluid ascending the fault lowers effective stress in the fault zone sufficiently to produce a significant transient increase in permeability. If the fluid is in an area of the fault adjacent to downthrown, relatively low pressure reservoir sands, the fluid will discharge into them. Permeability in and adjacent to the fault then decreases, such that fluid cannot reenter the fault zone and escape from the reservoir.",,,,,,,,,72,26,0,0,1,0,103,,,0149-1423,,,,,,,,,,,"Cornell Univ, Dept Geol Sci, Ithaca, NY 14853 USAWoods Hole Oceanog Inst, Dept Marine Chem & Geochem, Woods Hole, MA 02543 USAChevron Overseas Petr Inc, San Ramon, CA 94583 USAMichigan Technol Univ, Houghton, MI 49931 USA",,,,1999-02-01,WOS:000078355900004,,

The NTL stipulates that ocean current profiles be collected down to 1000 meters (from similar to 30 meters) at a minimum of 20 minute intervals and be delivered to the Department of Commerce, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's National Data Buoy Center (NOAA NDBC) at a minimum interval of 12 hours. Available technology at the time was largely limited to acoustic Doppler current profiling (ADCP) instruments manufactured by Teledyne RD Instruments (TRDI). By default, these instruments have been virtually the sole mechanism of data collection in the Gulf of Mexico until recently. The complete NDBC database of ocean current measurements stretches back to 2005 for many of the installations and contains mid to upper level current measurements of immediate (e.g., operational thresholds, search and rescue, etc.) and long term application (e.g., riser fatigue analysis, large scale ocean dynamic studies, etc.). Though the data has been quality controlled in regards to the current magnitude measurements, verification of the direction profiles has been identified as problematic.RPS Evans Hamilton Inc. (RPS) and Shell Global Solution Inc. (Shell) recently entered into a collaboration to assess the quality and variation of the water column ocean current data collected on Shell assets. While the measurements of ocean current velocity appear to be robust, the current direction time series from many of the installations on drill ships exhibit full water column variation over very short timescales that are likely not representative of the environmental conditions. These anomalies manifest as full-profile shifts in current direction spanning the full range of heading measurements (0 - 360 degrees). The shifts do not appear to be correlated with physical phenomena in the area of data collection but do appear to correlate with changes in the floating platform's operational heading. The scale and deviation of the shifts vary widely and randomly, with no correlation to the measured instrument heading change observed by the onboard motion reference unit (MRU).RPS and Shell Metocean have hypothesized that the anomalies exhibited in the current direction measurements may originate in the onboard MRU utilized by the above-mentioned ADCPs to determine relative heading for transformation of the measured raw beam velocity data. To test this hypothesis, a true north-seeking fiber optic MRU has been added to the deployment configuration on one of the Shell drill ships. Initial results indicated that the fiber optic MRU heading measurements were much more stable and did not exhibit the radical variation observed in the onboard MRU during repositioning of the floating drillship. Post-processing of the raw beam velocity data using the recorded fiber optic MRU output completely eliminated the anomalous shifts in water column current direction profiles and agreed well with independent measurement and synoptic scale predictions.",,,,,Conference on OCEANSConference on OCEANS,"SEP 18-21, 2017SEP 18-21, 2017",,"Anchorage, AKAnchorage, AK",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,0197-7385,,*****************,,,,,,,,,"RPS Grp Inc, Ocean Sci, Houston, TX 77070 USAShell Explorat & Prod, Houston, TX USATeledyne RDI, Poway, CA USA",RPS Grp IncTeledyne RDI,,,2017-01-01,WOS:000455012000149,,

Such differences could affect the diagnostic ratios among different biomarkers and cause difficulties in oil spill fingerprinting. This study thus examined the stability and suitability of three groups of biomarkers, i.e., sesquiterpanes, steranes, and terpanes, for CDO characterization in seawater after application of a representative chemical dispersant (Corexit 9500A). The results indicated that the suitability of sesquiterpanes as biomarkers for CDO identification was affected due to less number of stable diagnostic ratios and overlapped ranges of diagnostic ratios compared to other reference oils. On the contrary, most of the steranes and terpanes could still be applied as biomarkers for CDO characterization. All the selected diagnostic ratios of terpanes were suitable for identification of oil sources. By considering both the stability and suitability, the recommended ranking of biomarkers for CDO was terpanes > steranes > sesquiterpanes.

There are some major considerations during this operation. Especially, when lifting off the structure, if operating conditions such as ocean environmental loads and hoisting (or lowering) speed are bad, the excess of tension of wire ropes of the crane and the collision between the offshore support vessel and the structure can be occurred due to the relative motion between them. To solve this problem, this study performs the lifting simulation while the offshore support vessel installs the structure. The simulation includes the calculation of dynamic responses of the offshore support vessel and the equipment, including the wire tension and the collision detection.

Microalgae play an important ecological role as they are ubiquitous in marine environments and sequester inorganic pollutants which they transform into organic biomass. Of particular interest in this study is their role as a sink for atmospheric CO2, a greenhouse gas, and nitrate, one cause of harmful algal blooms. Novel chemometric hard-modeling methodologies have been developed for interpreting phytoplankton's chemical and physiological adaptations to changes in their growing environment. These methodologies will facilitate investigations of environmental impacts of anthropogenic pollutants on chemical and physiological properties of marine microalgae (here: Nannochloropsis oculata). It has been demonstrated that attenuated total reflection Fourier transform infrared (ATR FT-IR) spectroscopy can gain insights into both and this study only focuses on the latter. From time-series of spectra, the rate of microalgal biomass settling on top of a horizontal ATR element is derived which reflects several of phytoplankton's physiological parameters such as growth rate, cell concentrations, cell size, and buoyancy. In order to assess environmental impacts on such parameters, microalgae cultures were grown under 25 different chemical scenarios covering 200-600 ppm atmospheric CO2 and 0.35-0.75 mM dissolved NO3-. After recording time-series of ATR FT-IR spectra, a multivariate curve resolution-alternating least squares (MCR-ALS) algorithm extracted spectroscopic and time profiles from each data set. From the time profiles, it was found that in the considered concentration ranges only NO3- has an impact on the cells' physiological properties. In particular, the cultures' growth rate has been influenced by the ambient chemical conditions. Thus, the presented spectroscopicthornchemometric methodology enables investigating the link between chemical conditions in a marine ecosystem and their consequences for phytoplankton living in it.",,,,,,,,,2,1,0,0,1,0,2,,,0003-7028,1943-3530,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Tennessee, Dept Chem, 552 Buehler Hall, Knoxville, TN 37996 USA",,,,2019-02-13,WOS:000429105000003,28777003,

In order to be reliable and cost-effective, all these devices require regular Underwater Inspection Repair and Maintenance (IRM) services. Nowadays the solutions of underwater inspection and maintenance are industrial class ROVs and divers. Since the current ROV solutions still do not provide a sufficiently low cost and high precision for many of the IRM operations (underwater welding, welding inspection, fouling removal, painting, valves operation, sacrificial anodes replacement, connecting underwater plugs, etc...), specialised divers are still being used by the industry, despite the high-risk and high rate of mortality and discouragement from regulatory associations such as DNV saying that “Installation, maintenance and decommissioning should be performed without a need for divers, where possible.”[1]Due to the lack of tools specially designed for the Ocean Energy technologies, the industry is obliged to use standard solutions that are commonly used in the oil and gas industry, which have a higher cost.The Kraken project aims to tackle the existing gap of the ROV tools specially designed for the Ocean Energy sector needs with the objective to reduce the high OPEX costs associated to the underwater IRM. The development of a maintenance system that can be installed in any inspection/general class ROV and carry out all the services currently performed by divers and a good range of those performed by larger ROVs will decrease logistics and consequently the operational costs for the underwater IRM services by 50%. Kraken brings mature proven telemanipulation technologies from surgical rooms into the deep sea. Kraken’s objective is to improve the performance level of the offshore IRM operations by completely avoiding the human hazard of using divers and to reduce significantly the costs of work class ROVs by using smaller inspection ROVs deployed from much smaller vessels at a fraction of the cost. The Kraken project consists in the development of three main components: • A seven degree of freedom arm installed on the ROV, that guarantees high dexterity of the robotic arm underwater motion• A docking system to connect the ROV and the underwater object, and therefore increases the precision of the arm and make possible even the most complex operations• An intuitive control unit that allows the operator to solve most of the control issues intuitively.

We have produced, for the first time, high-resolution maps of detrital mineral quantities over an area that is similar to many oil and gas reservoirs. Spatial mineralogy patterns (based on x-ray diffraction data) and statistical analyses revealed that estuarine sediment composition is primarily controlled by provenance (i.e., the character of bedrock and sediment drift in the source area). The distributions of quartz, feldspar, carbonates, and day minerals are controlled by a combination of the grain size of specific minerals (e.g., rigid vs. brittle grains) and estuarine hydrodynamics. The abundance of quartz, feldspar, carbonates, and day minerals is predictable as a function of depositional environment and critical grain-size thresholds.

Bering himself died on the island, but more than half of the crew survived, including the naturalist and physician Georg Steller. The ship-wrecked men faced the enemies of scurvy, hunger and cold - and arctic foxes Alopex lagopus. The foxes invaded their camp and molested them cunningly, to such an extent that the men not only killed a large number but also tortured many foxes. The foxes stole food, dragged away with all sorts of items, and mutilated the dead. The tame nature of these foxes probably resulted from long isolation without any contact with humans, a similar behaviour has also been reported from other isolated islands (e.g. Jan Mayen and Greenland). Since the discovery of the Commander Islands, the Aleutians and Alaska, numerous hunting expeditions set out from both Russia and America and returned with thousands of pelts of arctic foxes, sea otter, fur seals and sea lions. The Steller sea cow was exterminated in a few years, and the sea otter only narrowly escaped extermination. The arctic fox survived on the Commander Islands and was extensively hunted until recently. The blue foxes there are still tame and cunning, but now less so in winter than in summer. Since 1993, the two tiny islands have been protected as a Nature Reserve. Foxes still thrive on Bering Island, but the foxes on Mednyi Island have suffered from an alarmingly high mortality and reduction in population size. A reason for this may be ear mange introduced by dogs, to which the foxes appear to be much susceptive. The foxes on the two Commander Islands possibly belong to two isolated subspecies, and it would be tragic if they were to be exterminated. On Mednyi Island the foxes live in large family groups of up to 6 grown-up individuals defending a common territory, even today when the territory, even today when reduced.

Two new sections analyzed in Belgium and the Ural Mountains record the event, but peak values are less than or equal to+5.5parts per thousand. The presence of key conodont zones allows for good correlation between Europe and North America, and indicates that a major time gap cannot account for the differences in delta(13)C(carb). Patterns of diagenetic alteration are similar among sections and also do not appear to fully explain the lower values in European carbonate. The observed variability of several per mil, which is typical for Paleozoic excursions that are also recorded in epeiric sea carbonates, likely reflects a significant role for local carbon cycling in delta(13)C of dissolved inorganic carbon. Enhanced regeneration of phosphate under anoxic conditions in western North American basins is interpreted to have increased biological pumping of C-12 and locally elevated delta(13)C relative to mean surface ocean water. The lower delta(13)C in the European sections is interpreted to be more representative of the global surface oceans, rather than having been influenced by influx of respired C-12 during increased water mass residence time on the shelf The interpretation of the influence of local carbon cycling on delta(13)C(carb) has implications for calculations of global organic carbon burial rates. Model input of a shift to values of greater than or equal to+7parts per thousand predicts steady-state increases in the fraction of carbon buried as organic matter of as much as 50-75parts per thousand. assuming no changes in the riverine input. This would require a rapid buildup of extensive global sinks for C-org that could accommodate similar to1.5x10(20) g of excess burial above and beyond the steady state during the similar to2 Myr event. However, use of a lower value for delta(13)C(carb) (closer to the +5.5parts per thousand in European sections) in global models makes it easier to account for carbon storage in basins such as the Antler and related foreland basins of the western margin of Euramerica, in addition to the unknown amounts buried in deep-sea environments during the Early Mississippian.

A two-step absorption column-photobioreactor system employing alkaline carbonate solution and flat plate photobioreactors is proposed. Together with process optimisation, the choice of microalgae species is vital to ensure continuous performance with optimal efficiency. In this paper, in addition to critically assessing the system design and operation conditions for optimisation, five criteria are selected for choosing optimal microalgae species for biogas upgrading. These include: ability for mixotrophic growth; high pH tolerance; external carbonic anhydrase activity; high CO2 tolerance; and ease of harvesting. Based on such criteria, five common microalgae species were identified as potential candidates. Of these, Spirulina platensis is deemed the most favourable species. An industrial perspective of the technology further reveals the significant challenges for successful commercial application of microalgal upgrading of biogas, including: a significant land footprint; need for decreasing microalgae solution recirculation rate; and selecting preferable microalgae utilisation pathway.",,,,,,,,,54,1,0,0,25,0,55,,,0734-9750,1873-1899,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Coll Cork, MaREI Ctr, Environm Res Inst, Cork T23 XE10, IrelandUniv Coll Cork, Sch Engn, Cork, IrelandSRM Univ AP, Dept Environm Sci, Amaravati 522502, Andhra Pradesh, IndiaChongqing Univ, Key Lab Low Grade Energy Utilizat Technol & Syst, Chongqing 400044, Peoples R China",,,,2019-12-13,WOS:000500376100015,31476422,

Chemosynthetic communities were found at all of the sites, along with hydrocarbon seepage, carbonates, and occasional brine seeps. Seep-related megafaunal communities were sampled at each site. Bathymodiolid mussels, representing at least four different species, were sampled from every site visited. Vestimentiferan tubeworms were visually confirmed at every site except one, and the tubeworms were collected from seven sites. Four of the 10 sites had diverse and densely populated seep communities and topographically complex sea-floor geology. These four sites became our key sampling locations: Atwater Valley Block 340 (2,200 m depth), Green Canyon Block 852 (1,410 m depth), Alaminos Canyon Block 601 (2,340 m depth), and Alaminos Canyon Block 818 (2,740 m depth). Two of the most important chemosynthetic faunal groups are the bathymodiolid mussels and vestimentiferan tubeworms. Prior to the Alvin cruise, the depth occurrence interval for Bathymodiolus childressi was established with a range from 500 to 2,200 m. For another mussel, Bathymodiolus heckerae, sample collections made during this cruise extended the depth range for this species. Previously, this species had never been observed shallower than 2,220 m and was never found with B. childressi. The mussel with the widest depth range was found to be Bathymodiolus brooksi, which is the most common mussel found in middle and lower slope depths. Based on tubeworm collections, Escarpia laminata was found to be the dominant species below water depths of about 1,400 m. An undescribed species of tubeworm, Lamellibranchia sp., was found to be abundant on the mid-slope between water depths of 1,100 to 2,300 m. Regarding slope-wide faunal changes, our collections indicated that along-slope changes were not significant, but depth-dependent changes were particularly apparent in the mussels and tubeworms. The communities of organisms associated with tubeworms and mussels at lower-slope seep sites were found to be quite different than upper slope (less than 1,000 m) communities. Gastropods and mollusks are dominant on the shallow slope while brittle stars, holothurians (sea cucumbers), and heart urchins are most abundant in middle-to-lower slope depths. Gorgonians were observed at most sites, while large colonies of bamboo corals were present at Alaminos Canyon 645. An extensive coral community, including Scleractinian and hard corals and several octocorals, were observed on large carbonate boulders at Green Canyon 852. A voucher specimen of the hard coral, Enallopsammia rostrata, was collected at a water depth of 1,397 m, which extended the depth range of this species. Another interesting find was a large brine lake at one of our deepest sites, Alaminos Canyon 601. The brine lake was approximately 4 m deep and 180 m wide. The salinity of the lake brine was about 2 times that of sea water, and white flocs were found floating in the brine. The white flocs were observed on the lake bottom and concentrated at the shoreline. This white material was later determined to be barium sulfate (barite), a high specific gravity mineral used in drilling mud. However, this occurrence of barite is natural and did not result from drilling for oil and gas. There was no animal life visible in the brine, and after analyzing core samples, researchers found no animal life at the brine lake bottom, either. Heart urchin and mussel communities were distributed in patches around the lake edge. Results from this cruise confirm the widespread existence of hydrocarbon seep habitats and their chemosynthetic communities on the middle and lower parts of the continental slope. The cross-slope and along-slope variability in the geology and geochemistry of these deep-sea seeps suports a surprisingly high density of biological communities. Hydrocarbon seepage sustains life to the deepest parts of the Gulf of Mexico, and highly productive chemosynthetic communities are not limited to water depths shallower than 1,000 m.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2022-03-17,DRCI:DATA2022044023370381,,

One of the most important challenges as regards renewable energy generation is to be able to move to a new low carbon economy in which energy demands can be met while the levels of CO2 emitted are reduced. In this respect, most of the energy obtained from marine currents, the most predictable renewable energy source, is located at great depths. In order to take advantage of this energy, different types of technologies are currently being developed whose economic viability necessitates a reduction in costs. The development of automated systems that will allow the orientation and depth of tidal energy converters to change automatically in order to reduce maintenance maneuvers and take advantage of the energy resource in an optimal manner is, therefore, essential. This paper analyzes the economic feasibility of the automation of installation and maintenance maneuvers on tidal energy farms by means of the levelized cost of energy (LCOE) and costs. These aspects have been analyzed in the case of the Alderney Race (United Kingdom). The results obtained show that the use of marine current harnessing devices with automated maneuvers has a relatively important economic advantage over those devices designed with the technology that requires manual maneuvers for the installation and operation procedures, thus enabling the cost of energy to be reduced and increasing the profitability of the project.",,,,,,,,,8,0,0,0,1,0,8,,,,2071-1050,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Castilla La Mancha, Escuela Tecn Super Ingenieros Ind Albacete, Albacete 02071, SpainUniv Politecn Madrid, Escuela Tecn Super Ingenieros Navales, E-28040 Madrid, Spain",,,,2020-08-10,WOS:000501205200094,,

The concerns in deploying new technology are significant in offshore oil and gas (O&G) operations, as they involve hazardous procedures. Moreover, technology is considered new when applied to offshore O&G operations due to the variability of technical challenges from field to field and the complexity of systems with limited space and experience in a harsh and sensitive environment.

For compliance it is necessary to have a comprehensive understanding of the possible spread, fate and impacts of any leaked CO2, and also the ability to detect and quantify any leakage. Over the past decade, a number of field scale CO2 release experiments have been conducted around the world to address many of the uncertainties regarding the characteristics of near-surface expression of CO2 in terms of the impact and quantitation of CO2 leaks. In these experiments, either free phase or dissolved CO2 is injected and released into the shallow subsurface so as to artificially simulate a CO2 leak into the near-surface environment. The experiments differ in a number of ways, from the geological conditions, surface environments, injection rates and experimental set-up-including the injection and monitoring strategy. These experiments have provided abundant information to aid in the development of our scientific understanding of environmental impacts of CO2 while assessing state of the art monitoring techniques.We have collated a global dataset of field-scale shallow controlled release experiments that have released CO2 at depths shallower than 25 m. The dataset includes 14 different field experiment locations, of which nine intended to release CO2 to surface, and the remaining sites intended for CO2 to remain in the shallow subsurface. Several release experiments have been conducted at half of these sites, and so in total, 42 different CO2 release tests have taken place at the 14 sites we examine. These experiments and their results are scrutinised to establish: (i) the range of experimental approaches and environments explored to date (such as the environment, subsurface conditions, injection strategy and whether gaseous or dissolved CO2 were injected and in what quantities); (ii) the range of CO2 injection and surface release rates at these experiments; (iii) the collective learnings about the surface and subsurface manifestation of the CO2 release, the spread and fate of the CO2, rates of CO2 flux to surface, and methods of measuring these; (iv) how successfully current approaches can detect and quantify CO2. This allows us to highlight where uncertainties remain and identify knowledge gaps that future experiments should seek to address. We also draw on the collective experiences to identify common issues or complications, and so recommend best practice' guidelines for experiment design and reporting at future CO2 release experiments.(C) 2017 The Authors.

These ways are access to address with policy. On the other hand, in the United States, Canada and Australia, the concept of CCS has been actively discussed to approach technical solution.By the 2014 worldwide, 55 large-scale integrated CCS projects are promoted.

The portfolio of operational large-scale CCS projects is expected to grow to 22 over the next 18 months or so, widening the range of countries, industries and technologies. This equates to a CO2 capture capacity of around 40 Mtpa. This portfolio of large-scale CCS projects is complemented by a cohort of notable pilot and demonstration projects across the world, some capturing and storing 100,000 tonnes or more of CO2 per year.Environmental laws related to the CCS have been studied worldwide.

CCS(Carbon dioxide Capture and Storage)란 산업 또는 에너지 관련 배출원으로부터 이산화탄소를 포집하여, 지하에 저장함으로써 장기간 대기로부터 격리시키는 기술을 의미한다. 본 연구에서는 기후변화 대응수단으로서의 CCS기술 개념을 살펴보고 이것이 어떻게 이산화탄소를 감축하는 데 기여하는지와 국제적으로 어디까지 연구가 진행되어 왔는지, 그리고 CCS기술을 실행하면서 법률적으로 어떤 문제가 발생할 수 있는지를 구체적으로 살펴보고자 한다. CCS기술을 활용하면 원유 또는 천연가스를 함유할 수 있는 다공질 암석과 같은 종류에 장기간 동안 CO2를 가두어 놓을 수 있다. 이와 관련하여 가장 핵심적으로 제기되는 문제는 예측불가능성이다. 지하에 주입된 이산화탄소가 지속적으로 지하에 봉인된 채로 존재할 것인지 아니면 수직상승하여 지면으로 누출되거나 그 밖의 예측 불가능한 형태로 이동할 것인지에 대한 우려를 완벽히 해결할 수 없다는 점이 핵심적인 문제로 거론된다. 따라서 CCS와 관련된 법률적 차원의 핵심쟁점은 CCS기술의 안전성 확보를 위한 규제와 연구는 물론이고 대중들의 기후변화에 대한 환경의식 전환, 일반시민들의 협조와 소통, 토지소유권자 또는 이해관계자에 대한 법적인 보상, 공익과 사익의 균형 등이라고 할 수 있다. 본 연구에서는 CCS개념과 CCS와 관련된 법적 쟁점을 파악한 후 그 쟁점에 대한 접근방법을 해외 사례(미국, 캐나다, 일본, 호주, 유럽 등)를 통해 살펴보고자 한다. 이산화탄소 포집과 저장에 대한 연구, 사전조사, 지역답사, 시행, 사후관리에 이르기까지 지역주민들의 반대정서에 어떻게 대응하는지 또는 어떻게 대중소통을 진행하고 있는지 연구하였다. 지역주민소통에 관한 사항은 특히 캐나다와 미국의 CCS실증 현장 답사를 통해 실무적인 인터뷰로 진행하였다. 또한 토지소유권과 관련하여 미국에서는 어떠한 법리로 분쟁을 해결했는지 몇 가지 판례를 이론적으로 분석하였다. CCS는 특성상 기술적 가능성만으로 시행 가능한 것이 아니고 지역주민과 소통을 하고 안정성을 가진 법제도를 확보함으로써 실현할 수 있는 복합적인 분야이다. 그래서 이 기술을 산업분야에 적용을 할 때 특히 NIMBY현상이 심한 우리나라의 주민정서 상 어떻게 대응을 할 것인지 해외사례가 시사하는 바를 고찰할 필요가 있다. 본 연구의 활용방안으로서는 CO2 지중저장 환경관리 법안을 입법하는데 기초자료로 활용될 수 있을 것이다. 나아가 안전성 확보, 지중저장 후 누출에 대한 모니터링 책임, 누출 시 분쟁해결 기준, 환경피해 보상기준 등을 논의하고 법안을 마련하는데 참고자료로 활용 가능할 것이다.",,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,1975-0005,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2016-01-01,KJD:ART002077000,,

In order to be reliable and cost-effective, all these devices require regular Underwater Inspection Repair and Maintenance (IRM) services. Nowadays the solutions of underwater inspection and maintenance are industrial class ROVs and divers. Since the current ROV solutions still do not provide a sufficiently low cost and high precision for many of the IRM operations (underwater welding, welding inspection, fouling removal, painting, valves operation, sacrificial anodes replacement, connecting underwater plugs, etc...), specialised divers are still being used by the industry, despite the high-risk and high rate of mortality and discouragement from regulatory associations such as DNV saying that “Installation, maintenance and decommissioning should be performed without a need for divers, where possible.”[1]Due to the lack of tools specially designed for the Ocean Energy technologies, the industry is obliged to use standard solutions that are commonly used in the oil and gas industry, which have a higher cost.The Kraken project aims to tackle the existing gap of the ROV tools specially designed for the Ocean Energy sector needs with the objective to reduce the high OPEX costs associated to the underwater IRM. The development of a maintenance system that can be installed in any inspection/general class ROV and carry out all the services currently performed by divers and a good range of those performed by larger ROVs will decrease logistics and consequently the operational costs for the underwater IRM services by 50%. Kraken brings mature proven telemanipulation technologies from surgical rooms into the deep sea. Kraken’s objective is to improve the performance level of the offshore IRM operations by completely avoiding the human hazard of using divers and to reduce significantly the costs of work class ROVs by using smaller inspection ROVs deployed from much smaller vessels at a fraction of the cost.

Oil and gas development were investigated as one of several potential causes of changes in the salinity of Muddy Creek, which drains 2470 km(2) of mostly public land in Wyoming, U.S.A. Stream discharge and salinity vary with seasonal snowmelt and define a primary salinity-discharge relationship. Salinity, measured by specific conductance, increased substantially in 2009 and was 53-71% higher at low discharge and 33-34% higher at high discharge for the-years 2009-2012 compared to 2005-2008. Short-term processes (e.g., flushing of efflorescent salts) cause within-year deviations from the primary relation but do not obscure the overall increase in salinity. Dissolved elements associated with increased salinity include calcium, magnesium, and sulfate, a composition that points to native soil salts derived from marine shales as a likely source. Potential causes of the salinity increase were evaluated for consistency by using measured patterns in stream chemistry, slope of the salinity-discharge relationship, and inter-annual timing of the salinity increase. Potential causes that were inconsistent with one or more of those criteria included effects from precipitation, evapotranspiration, reservoirs, grazing, irrigation return flow, groundwater discharge, discharge of energy co-produced waters, and stream habitat restoration. In contrast, surface disturbance of naturally salt-rich soil by oil and gas development activities, such as pipeline, road, and well pad construction, is a reasonable candidate for explaining the salinity increase. As development continues to expand in semiarid lands worldwide, the potential for soil disturbance to increase stream salinity should be considered, particularly where soils host substantial quantities of native salts.

While abatement remains the most desirable policy, certain climate engineering strategies, including forest and soil management for carbon sequestration, merit broad-scale application. Other proposed strategies, such as biochar production and geological carbon capture and storage, are rated somewhat lower, but deserve further research and development. Iron fertilization of the oceans and solar radiation management, although cost-effective, received the lowest ratings on most criteria.

Comparability of indicator data across regions will be important for the future monitoring and modeling of the effects of changes in the arctic environment such as those influenced by diminishing sea ice cover and increasing ocean acidification which will impact fisheries production and distribution. Equally important, the collection and analysis of time-series social indicator data could aid in understanding how arctic residents experience the processes of globalization as they participate in industries such as fisheries that are increasingly dominated by non-local corporations. Because of this extrinsic control of resources, social indicator data reflecting local ownership in fisheries rights and revenues could be functional in understanding how changes in fisheries impact arctic livelihoods. It is also necessary to understand how changes in fisheries fit within a broader resource use and arctic development context, for example, in conjunction with the oil and gas industry.

Depending on the nature of population subdivision, it can also provide a means for assessing the source population of dead or injured individuals of unknown geographic origin. This type of information can be particularly useful in instances of large-scale environmental accidents, such as oil spills. Following the wreck of the 'Erika' oil tanker in the Bay of Biscay in December 1999, more than 80 000 seabirds were washed ashore along the west coast of France. The most heavily affected species (80% of all birds) was the common guillemot Uria aalge, a widespread long-lived colonial seabird. In an attempt to evaluate the 'true' geographic extent of this accident, we carried out population genetic analyses using 6 microsatellite markers on samples from 22 breeding colonies in the North Atlantic and on individuals collected after the oil spill. A pattern of isolation by distance was detected among common guillemot populations, but populations were only weakly structured, even at large spatial scales. The low level of genetic differentiation between colonies prevented clear assignments of oiled birds to their population of origin using only the genetic information. The weak genetic structure suggests that little genetic variability was lost during the oil spill and implies a high potential for population recovery via dispersal. However, current gene flow among extant colonies may overestimate the capacity of locally extinct colonies to recover due to the behavioural processes involved in recruitment. Clearly, the mortality of tens of thousands of high-latitude seabirds due to oil pollution warrants ongoing scientific scrutiny and conservation effort.",,,,,,,,,33,0,0,0,36,0,37,,,0171-8630,1616-1599,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Paris 06, CNRS, UMR 7625, Lab Ecol, F-75005 Paris, FranceUniv Paris 06, CNRS, UMR 7103, Lab Parasitol, F-75005 Paris, FranceInst Rech Dev, CNRS, IRD, UMR 2724, F-34394 Montpellier, FranceQueens Univ, Dept Biol, Kingston, ON K7L 3N6, Canada",,,,2005-01-01,WOS:000229699400023,,

Crude oil compounds, including polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), pose significant environmental damages due to their wide distribution, persistence, high toxicity, mutagenicity, and carcinogenicity. Microbial community of Sinduri beach sediments samples was analyzed by metagenomic data with 16S rRNA gene amplicons. Three phyla (Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, and Bacteroidetes) accounted for approximately >= 93.0% of the total phyla based on metagenomic analysis. Proteobacteria was the dominant phylum in Sinduri beach sediments. Cultivable bacteria were isolated from PAH-enriched cultures, and bacterial diversity was investigated through performing culture characterization followed by molecular biology methods. Sixtyseven isolates were obtained, comprising representatives of Actinobacteria, Firmicutes, alpha- and gamma-Proteobacteria, and Bacteroidetes. PAH catabolism genes, such as naphthalene dioxygenase (NDO) and aromatic ring hydroxylating dioxygenase (ARHDO), were used as genetic markers to assess biodegradation of PAHs in the cultivable bacteria. The ability to degrade PAHs was demonstrated by monitoring the removal of PAHs using a gas chromatography mass spectrometer. Overall, various PAH-degrading bacteria were widely present in Sinduri beach sediments and generally reflected the restored microbial community. Among them, Cobetia marina, Rhodococcus soli, and Pseudoalteromonas agarivorans were found to be significant in degradation of PAHs. This large collection of PAH-degrading strains represents a valuable resource for studies investigating mechanisms of PAH degradation and bioremediation in oil contaminated coastal environment, elsewhere.

One strategy for hydrate management is the injection of anti-agglomerants (AAs), allowing to form flowable hydrate slurries. For long tie-backs for gas and/or condensate under cold environments (the North Sea and deep offshore), combined with a Joule-Thomson cooling, the temperature can often decrease below 0 degrees C. In such cases, hydrate slurries first formed with AAs enter into the ice region. Thus, the impact of AAs on ice/hydrates formation needs to be identified for safe and sustainable operation. Transportability of hydrate slurries inside the ice region and AAs efficiency on hydrate/ice slurries formation has not been previously studied. We investigated the performance of AAs under the flow of water and oil on ice formation, and gas hydrates formation followed by ice formation using the rock-flow cell, which enables direct visual observation to see when, where, and how those solids form. Without AAs, solid hydrates and/or ice bed stick to the bottom of the pipe, thus reducing the flowability. While the poor-performing AA does not largely change how hydrates and ice form, the good-performing AA can disperse hydrate beds into flowable slurries, ensuring flowability. Ice chunks may still form, but they flow well along with hydrate slurries in the conditions tested. This ice/hydrates co-existence and co-formation are of great interest in certain field conditions, and thus the effect of AAs has to be re-evaluated to optimize their use for successful risk management in oil/gas production systems.",,,,,,,,,19,0,0,0,3,0,19,,,0016-2361,1873-7153,,,,,,,,,,"Colorado Sch Mines, Phases Flow Lab, Chem & Biol Engn Dept, Golden, CO 80401 USATotal E&P USA, Houston, TX 77002 USATotal SA, CSTJF, F-64018 Pau, France",Total E&P USA,,,2019-08-27,WOS:000479141700080,,

Overlaps between areas that are presently used for fishing and areas that are subject to regulations prohibiting this activity were analyzed. Information on regulations establishing no-fishing zones, the most important fishing sites and fishing records were gathered and superimposed using a GIS dataset. Main fishing zones were located within prohibited fishing areas. Regulations limiting fishing activity govern navigation routes and pipeline safety zone, whereas environmental law restrictions were less important. Due to economic and industrial development, oil and gas distribution and harbor construction projects are increasing, aggravating use conflicts and jeopardizing fishing activity. Legislation fragments usable fishing areas forcing fishers to operate within prohibited zones. Neglect of fishermen's interests, and their exclusion on the decision-making process led to a legislative scenario that reduce fishing legal zone to few areas, which in most cases fisherman are not even aware were they are, being the main reasons for fisher's failure to comply with the current regulations, increasing the number of infractions and the marginalization of fishermen.

Continuous advances in technology have helped the oil and gas industry to extend the exploration and production activities to deep and ultra-deep waters in harsher environments. Field development in the offshore environment is associated with numerous significant challenges in different phases including exploration, reservoir description and characterization, development planning, drilling, production, improved oil recovery (IOR) and enhanced oil recovery (EOR), transportation, and decommissioning. These challenges are further complicated by economic restrictions, especially in periods when low or unstable oil prices weaken the incentives of investments due to the high risks and uncertainties involved. Environmental concerns including the adverse effects of seismic surveys, drilling activities, discharge of waste material and produced water, and accidental spills and blowouts add another level of complexity to the design and implementation of offshore projects. Safe, reliable, and efficient development of offshore hydrocarbon reservoirs can be achieved through the proper identification of the challenges and use of modern technologies and innovative methods. This work is an effort to provide a comprehensive review of the history, global distribution, production share, classification, characteristics, and characterization methods of offshore reservoirs, and some of the main aspects and challenges of the experimental and modeling works as well as IOR/EOR planning and implementations from the reservoir engineering and production standpoint. These challenges are categorized based on their area of impact, i.e., characterization and recovery (production) phases. Furthermore, economic and environmental challenges are reviewed.

A series of microscopic, spectroscopic and thermometric characterisation techniques were applied to the petroleum fluid inclusions in Gnarlyknots-1A, Potoroo-1, Greenly-1 and Duntroon-1 in order to estimate fluid types, palaeo-pressures and palaeo-temperatures (PT) of hydrocarbon entrapment, and to provide constraints on the age of petroleum migration in the central and eastern parts of the Ceduna Sub-basin. The Coniacian interval (Tiger Supersequence) in Gnarlyknots-1A trapped a variety of petroleum fluid types (black oil, light oil and gas-condensate) over an extended period. The earliest phase of oil entrapment recorded in quartz grains took place at a minimum of 58 degrees C as light oil and, together with pressure, constraints this to the end of the Cretaceous (circa 75 Ma). Source rocks capable of light oil generation at this time occur in the Blue Whale Supersequence. Petroleum compositions evolved toward more gas-rich fluids during the Cenozoic. This, together with some late oil constrained to Miocene age migration, implies generation from at least two source rocks. Source rocks capable of generating gas at this time are interpreted to be in the Blue Whale and White Pointer supersequences, while late oil may have been expelled from the Tiger Supersequence in the central basin depocentre. The palaeo-PT evolution recorded by the fluid inclusions in Gnarlyknots-1A closely follows the modelled burial curve, suggesting that the petroleum fluids were in thermal equilibrium with the rock. In contrast, the oil and gas inclusion assemblages found at Potoroo-1, Greenly-1 and Duntroon-1 were trapped later, with some at temperatures higher than the formation temperatures predicted from burial models. Whilst there are several potential mechanisms that explain these observations, we suggest that these wells are located near major extensional faults that have the potential for conducting fluids upwards. Additionally, gases such as CO2 and N-2 associated with hydrocarbons possibly relate to mixing with mantle-derived fluids, which may also have contributed to the aforementioned thermal anomalies.",,,,,,,,,5,0,0,0,0,0,5,,,0264-8172,1873-4073,,,,,,,,,,"CSIRO Energy, 26 Dick Perry Ave, Kensington, WA 6151, AustraliaCSIRO Energy, 14 Julius Ave, N Ryde, NSW 2113, AustraliaUniv Lorraine, CNRS, CREGU, GeoRessources Lab, BP 70239, F-54506 Vandoeuvre Les Nancy, France",,,,2020-05-14,WOS:000514747800042,,
J,,,,,,,,,,,Unlocking the enigma of Scottish harbour porpoise fine-scale habitat use,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Awarded Grant,Sep 30 2020,2020,"Harbour porpoises (Phocoena phocoena) are the most abundant and widespread cetacean in Scottish waters but are vulnerable to anthropogenic pressures such as noise from aquaculture and wind farm construction, bycatch in fisheries, and climate change. As a result, various national and international laws and agreements aim to protect porpoises from these pressures. In addition to general protection and inclusion in decision making processes, porpoises were the reason for the designation of one of Europe's largest protected areas, the cSAC along the west coast of Scotland in 2018.Porpoises are found in a range of habitats throughout Scottish waters. However, these habitats are not used equally with some favoured year round and others at particular times. This project will seek to understand the drivers for these differences, making use of existing datasets collected using passive acoustic monitoring (PAM). PAM is a commonly used technique to establish presence and relative abundance of echolocating porpoises in specific locations over extended time periods, using fixed or towed underwater acoustic detectors (hydrophones). Across both the east and west coasts, several projects have been collecting PAM data from fixed stations for up to a decade. While these data have all been collected for slightly different purposes, they have all used similar methods and so this project seeks to consider them at a more holistic level to better understand porpoise ecology and how and why porpoises use different environments. Most Scottish PAM studies to date have focused on large-scale trends in usage, however their use has also revealed intriguing patterns of habitat use that vary at fine-scales (<1km). Some of these differences have been found to occur over subtly different seabed habitats, depths and time scales. Integrating these data with environmental parameters is likely to help reveal and provide insights into which fundamental ecological and/or anthropogenic drivers underpin porpoise distribution and habitat use in Scottish waters. In this project, the student will have the opportunity to combine and explore previously independent datasets collected for a variety of reasons from across Scotland. Doing so will provide opportunities to better understand biases in standard survey methods and reveal wider patterns of habitat use by porpoises. In addition there may be the opportunity to collect new data to better test some of the environmental relationships that emerge. Discoveries associated with this project have the potential to provide information for conservation management efforts particularly in terms of improving monitoring strategies.This project will bring together previously disparate datasets, the student will deal with large datasets and the inherent challenges these bring (particularly extensive manipulation and error-checking). Analysis of these datasets will likely involve sophisticated statistical modelling approaches.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,2452686,,,,,,,,University of the Highlands and Islands,University of the Highlands and Islands,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:15387619,,

Installations require casings and piles to be impact driven and therefore a prediction of driveability has to be made prior to installation in order to select an appropriate hammer. The current industry practice of single blow analysis, using the so-called wave equation, tends to over-predict the driving effort at deeper penetrations since it neglects the positive effect of energy stored in pile and soil between hammer blows. This difference can be particularly significant when piles are driven to a great penetration where sediments are stiffer by virtue of the high overburden. Holloway et al. (1975) and Hery (1983) who developed the so-called Residual Stress Analyses in the DUKEFOR and GRLWEAP wave equation programs respectively had already recognized this fact. Similarly, a recent study by Choe and Juvkam-Wold (1997), evaluating pile driving of long casing strings in deepwater concluded, that in order to properly simulate the driving behavior in stiff sediments at deep penetrations the interaction between consecutive hammer blows should be considered.",,,,,"OTRC Conference on Analysis, Design Construction, and Testing of Deep FoundationsOTRC Conference on Analysis, Design Construction, and Testing of Deep Foundations","APR 29-30, 1999APR 29-30, 1999","Offshore Technol Res Ctr; Amer Soc Civil Engineers, Geo InstOffshore Technol Res Ctr; Amer Soc Civil Engineers, Geo Inst","AUSTIN, TXAUSTIN, TX",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,0-7844-0422-4,,,,,,,,,"Dutt & Associates Inc, Bellaire, TX 77401 USA",Dutt & Associates Inc,,,1999-01-01,WOS:000084506400013,,

The result of uncontrolled spills & leakages may cause the contamination of groundwater as well as methane emission into the atmosphere increasing global warming, while the spills in open waters in the case of offshore wellbores impact fragile marine ecosystems. The United States alone has similar to 1.7 million wellbores with an American Petroleum Institute (API) number indicating that they have not been permanently plugged and therefore require Plugging and Abandonment (P&A) in the future. However, there remain thousands of wells drilled before the 1950s that were not properly P&A. Improper P&A of boreholes are potential pathways for leakage as well as already existing leaky plugs. The objective of this literature review is to (1) assess subsurface conditions where P&A materials need to be placed, (2) assess the challenges encountered during barrier placement in wellbores under current P&A technologies, (3) appraise contaminations of barrier materials by drilling fluid and possible mitigation, and (4) discuss the future requirements of P&A materials and technology involved in restoring subsurface sealing barriers interrupted by drilling. The review indicates that to achieve permanent P&A in the future, two major challenges must be addressed: (1) innovation & improvement of the barrier materials, and (2) advancements and innovation of the placement methods. The major insight from this article is that re-establishment of a permanent seal capable of withstanding subsurface geomechanical and geochemical changes will involve engineered materials and processes providing sealing in the early stages (1-50 years) and geomaterials and geological processes take over and provide permanent seals, for thousands of years to geological times. Thus no single solution can be successful for future P&A campaigns.",,,,,,,,,23,0,0,0,0,0,24,,,1092-8758,1557-9018,,,,,,,,,,"Oklahoma State Univ, Dept Chem Engn, 420 Engn North, Stillwater, OK 74078 USAOklahoma State Univ, Sch Elect & Comp Engn, Stillwater, OK 74078 USA",,,,2020-04-22,WOS:000525515100001,,

Mixed-stock analyses (MSA) of allozyme data were used to compare collections from four sites (Endicott near Prudhoe Bay, Mikkelsen Bay, and Kaktovik in Alaska and Phillips Bay in Canada) and to assess variation in stock contributions among summer months and between 1987 and 1988. The MSA estimates for individual stocks were summed into estimates for three stock groups: western stocks from the area near Sagavarnirktok River and Prudhoe Bay (SAG), Arctic National Wildlife Refuge stocks (Arctic Refuge), and Canadian stocks. The MSA of Endicott samples taken in 1987 and 1988 did not differ among months in terms of contributions from local SAG stocks (range, 71-95%). Contributions from nonlocal (>100 km distant) Canadian and Arctic Refuge stocks were not different from zero in 1987, but contributions from Canadian stocks were so in July (17%) and August (20%) but not in September of 1988. Thus, stock contributions to Endicott collections were different between 1987 and 1988. Samples from the Kaktovik area in 1988 were different between months in terms of contributions from nonlocal SAG stocks (July, 7%; August, 27%). Significant contributions to these samples were made both months by Canadian (25% and 17%) and local Arctic Refuge stocks (68% and 56%). Among the four coastal sites, local stocks typically contributed most to collections; however, every site had collections that contained significant contributions from nonlocal stocks.

We analyzed the effects of turbine motion (rotating or not rotating), diel condition (day or night), and fish size (small, <= 10 cm; large, >10 cm) on individual fish behaviors, and compared behaviors of individual fish to schools of fish. When the turbine was rotating, the probability of fish entering the turbine decreased by over 35% from when it was not.

The growth of energy demand affects the economic and ecological situation in China since these areas are inevitably connected. Rapid growth in China's economy translates into substantial growth in energy demand. For the People's Republic of China, which places economic growth as the top priority of national policy, it is important to promote progress. Growth of energy consumption causes problems not only in China but also all over the world. These problems become very significant within the fact that energy sector itself is an increasingly politicised area. There are four components of the strategy of China's energy security: diplomatic works combine with efforts to negotiate forward basing rights aimed at lending legitimacy to a more large-scale Chinese presence in the Indian Ocean; strengthening economic ties with neighbour-countries and importing countries to ensure the steady energy supply; development of alternative fuels and energy savings in order to reduce dependence on oil and gas import; encouraging Chinese companies to participate and invest in overseas oil and gas projects, establishment of strategic oil reserves. To meet the increasing energy needs China must ensure stable and safe energy supplies from various regions. Therefore, now it is important to diversify and secure oil imports, get an access to basic resources and enhance the security of oil transportation from the Middle East. Concern for energy security made China pay attention to the strategic lines of communication (SLOCs). Free access from the coast of China into the Indian Ocean has a peculiar significance. It is obvious China fears the presence of the USA, which can control Chinese economy dependant on sea lines in the moments of crisis. SLOCs connecting China with Africa and Middle East pass through the Strait of Malacca. Ninety five percent of the oil used in China is transported by sea, and 80 percent of that is shipped through the strait, that is 15 million barrels of oil per day. The Strait of Malacca illustrates that China will depend heavily on international sea-lines to import oil from Africa and Middle East. That becomes a potential threat to energy security in accordance with the position of the USA. Considering vulnerability of SLOCs China developed a long-term strategy aimed to ensure the energy security and security of SLOCs. It is: to minimize the concerns of South and South-East Asia nations who worry of China's claims; undermine the claims of the USA to control the Asian sea space; suppress nationalism in China to maintain political and social stability. All these measures are parts of the so-called soft power. China is extremely good at using strategy, which Russia fails to acquire.

They are state, municipal and harbour officials, consultants, scientists and academics at technical universities, contractors and many other participants from the navigation industry. There is a strong governmental influence in the organization, as the governments of about 40 countries support PIANC both financially and by the participation of senior civil servants. In the two sections of the congresses, inland navigation and ocean navigation, 10 subjects are discussed. PIANC has always followed recent developments such as trends in shipping, reception facilities for ferries, special arrangements for the handling of containers, oil, gas and of dangerous or environmentally noxious goods. Not only the technical aspects of navigation, such as canals, dams, ports and maritime structures, are discussed, but also economics, port management and port capacity and safety. Environmental aspects, for instance of maintenance dredging and the disposal of dredged materials, are important topics. PIANC has long been interested in coastal problems, as these affect ports. As many ports extend into the sea, PIANC has considered ocean engineering including artificial islands, maritime constructions, salvage and the removal of wrecks and navigation under arctic conditions. PIANC is also active in the field of sport and pleasure navigation. Since 1982 PIANC has organized international working groups to report on specific topics. At present there are about 35 active working groups and 23 reports have been published. Their members are from about 30 countries. They may convene several times each year or work by correspondence. The recommendations of the working groups represent recent advances and are widely distributed. For instance, the report Beneficial Uses of Dredging Material was presented for discussion to the London Dumping Convention. Membership of PIANC is open to organizations and individuals. In most countries a national section is the contact point for the members. The General-Secretariat is in Brussels, Belgium.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,,0,0,0,,,0025-326X,,,,,,,,,,,"PIANC, Hof van Delfstraat 15, 2631, AH Nootdorp, Netherlands",,,,1994-01-01,BCI:BCI199598496653,,

It has been hypothesised that this activity pattern is a response to the diel behaviour of their major prey species. To test this hypothesis, we monitored the acoustic activity of two captive harbour porpoises held in a net pen continuously during a full year and fed by their human keepers during daylight hours, thus removing the influence of prey activity. The porpoises were exposed to similar temperature and ambient light conditions as free-ranging animals living in the same region. Throughout the year, there was a pronounced diel pattern in acoustic activity of the porpoises, with significantly greater activity at night, and a clear peak around sunrise and sunset throughout the year. Clicking activity was not dependent on lunar illumination or water level. Because the porpoises in the pen are fed and trained during daylight hours, the results indicate that factors other than fish behaviour are strongly influencing the diel clicking behaviour pattern of the species.",,,,,,,,,13,0,0,0,11,0,13,,,2045-2322,,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Southern Denmark, Dept Biol, Marine Biol Res Ctr, Hindsholmvej 11, DK-5300 Kerteminde, DenmarkUniv Southern Denmark, Dept Biol, Campusvej 55, DK-5230 Odense, DenmarkUniv Southern Denmark, Interdisciplinary Ctr Populat Dynam CPOP, Campusvej 55, DK-5230 Odense, Denmark",,,,2020-10-07,WOS:000571911300015,32913327,

The technological evolution exhibits a trend towards an increasing wall thickness (WT) to provide sufficient resistance for the very high operating pressures.Furthermore, the pipelay operations, especially when linepipes are installed by means of the reel laying method, cause repeated plastic bending and straightening deformation cycles. These cyclic loads affect final material stress-strain properties.Reeling is currently applied to an increasing range of pipe geometries, being the present limit given by pipes with 16 outer diameter (OD) and 30 mm wall thickness (WT).

Currently, abandonment is achieved through plugging the well bore with two columns of cement up to 160 meters in length and there remain questions regarding its cost effectiveness and its ability to effectively seal long term.The overall objective of the project is to develop a cost effective and high performingalternative to the current system of cement plugs qualified to the appropriate industrystandards. Specifically, this is to be a range of metal alloy plugs to act as a highly reliable, lightweight plugging and abandonment solution for offshore facilities utilisation that will be simpler and cheaper to install than the current solution. The use of metal alloy plugs for well abandonment has already been demonstrated in the onshore environment in Canada and this project will show that the principles are transferrable to the more demanding conditions seen in the North Sea.The development of the solution shall be split into two phases: -i. Phase 0 – Material testing to confirm viability of a range of metalalloys as a material suitable for use in well abandonment, proving the principal of casting this material under various conditions of: pressure, temperature and aqueous solutions and determining the as cast mechanical properties of the alloys to enable detail design to be progressed.ii.

The sediments were of the sand and mud alternation layer, which were turbidities and hemi-pelagic mud, respectively. Their sediment features such as grain size, porosity, and methane hydrate saturation of pore spaces were analyzed systematically.Relationships among grain size distribution, Bouma's sequence and hydrocarbon gas volume produced by methane hydrate dissociation were confirmed, thus we understood the correspondence of the features of turbidities features and methane hydrate saturation; i.e., we understood that the part of high methane hydrate saturation had a porosity of 50-55%, median of 1.9-3.3 phi, and grain sorting of from -1.4 to -0.4. These features indicate the lower section of turbidite called as Ta and/or Tb. Other sections of turbidite had small amounts of methane hydrate.From these results, we estimated that only permeable sections could maintain the accumulation of methane hydrate from first to last stage. If their pores had been filled with gas-saturated water and the pressure/temperature condition was sufficient for methane hydrate, the methane hydrate would precipitate homogeneously in sediments from its initial accumulation. However, methane hydrate precipitation reduces permeability because methane hydrate growth in pores causes a reduction of pore volume. During accumulation, it is inevitable that gas-rich fluid could not reach into low permeable layers, although it could still be supplied into high permeable layers. This mechanism does not need any cap rock or some trap system in sediments, and it is quite a different mechanism from conventional oil and gas accumulation.",,,,,,,,,29,2,0,0,0,0,30,,,0022-135X,1884-0884,,,,,,,,,,"Natl Inst Adv Ind Sci & Technol, Methane Hydrate Res Ctr, Tokyo, Japan",,,,2009-01-01,WOS:000446265200010,,

Such catastrophic events have a dramatic impact on marine ecosystems, affecting a broad range of species. Seabirds are placed at the uppermost trophic level of the marine food chain. Therefore, important toxic effects are expected in these organisms. The recent Prestige oil spill gave the opportunity to test this. A previous study reported that yellow-legged gulls (Larus michahellis) breeding in the oiled area (17 months after the spill) showed differences both in plasma biochemistry and in the total circulating levels of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (TPAHs) in blood regard to gulls sampled in clean areas. In the present study, wild yellow-legged gulls were fed with heavy fuel oil from the Prestige oil spill (P-gulls) and compared with control gulls (C-gulls) fed only with the vehicle (vegetable oil). Consistent with the cited previous findings, gulls fed with fuel oil showed reduced glucose and inorganic phosphorus levels in plasma, as well as a trend to significantly reduced creatinine values. In addition, glucose concentration was negatively related to TPAH levels. Males but not females fed with fuel oil showed higher plasma activity of asparatate aminotransferase (AST) than controls. With regard to plasma activity of gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT), the results were opposite to the previous study. The GGT activity increased in C-females, apparently to meet with increased liver metabolism due to egg laying demands, but not in P-females. Differences to the previous study possibly reflect different adaptive responses of these enzymes to an acute short-term exposure to heavy fuel oil. Since the yellow-legged gull belongs to a complex of species widely distributed throughout the Northern hemisphere, the results as a whole might provide a tool for future evaluations of short- and long-term effects of oil spills on seabirds. Decreased glucose and inorganic phosphorus levels in plasma are expected in both short- and long-lasting exposures to fuel oil, whereas responses of AST and GGT enzymes would depend on both the sex of individuals and the temporal pattern of exposure.

These assemblies are frequently the source of failure and so must be sealed, mostly at the metal connector-to-cable interface. This is normally achieved using a polyurethane (PU) encapsulant system that bonds at the interface between the metal connector back shell and the cable. In environments where sacrificial anodes are used, however, cable connector assemblies are prone to cathodic delamination (CD, oxygen reduction increasing OH- concentration at the PU/metal interface), which can compromise PU-to-metal bonds causing failure. Materials that are resistant to CD failure are therefore highly desirable. New EC REACH legislation has further regulated the use of hazardous chemicals in the production and use of polymers. New, compliant materials have emerged, although lack well-established performance testing. Hence, in this work, stainless steel 316L, bronze CW451K, titanium Ti6Al4V, PU and commercially available primers (PR24 and PR91) were used to investigate CD failures in cable connector assemblies and galvanic coupling effects.

Understanding the biogeochemical fluxes and recruitment of fish in relation to changes in climate requires knowledge of the factors influencing mesozooplankton biomass and fluxes. Here, the trophic and metabolic characteristics of mesozooplankton. for the oceanic, upwelling and eddy system of the CCS are reviewed. Mesoscale phenomena are of importance in this region as besides upwelling filaments, the eddy system shed from the Canary Islands is unique in comparison with other similar systems such as the Humboldt, California and Benguela. The coupling of production in the coastal area off Northwest Africa with the oceanic zone through filaments and eddies topographically formed in the coast or shed by the islands promotes a continuous transport of organic matter towards the deep ocean. Zooplankton follow the signal of the mesoscale phenomena and are good tracers of advection. The different species, which can be used as targets in the area, are also described from the upwelling region to the open ocean. However, not all the variability in the area is explained by bottom-up controls. The effect of diel vertical migrants feeding on epipelagic zooplankton shows that top-down controls are also important to understanding the structure and fluxes in this oceanic environment.

Here, a potential storage site was discovered, away from hydrocarbon reservoirs, using public information. CO2 would be injected 15-40 km downdip from the margin of almost un-drilled regionally extensive Permian (Rotliegend) Sandstone saline aquifer. The CO2 would migrate buoyantly towards the aquifer margin under an evaporite top-seal, becoming partly trapped by residual saturation effects. Any remaining CO2 would be retained in the stratigraphic pinch-out trap at the edge of the aquifer. The lateral seal at the margin is most likely to be metamorphic basement - of presumed low permeability, inferred to be overlain by dolomite-anhydrite sediments. Using conservative assumptions, 170-690 Mt of CO2 could be stored along a 50 km long section of the 300 km margin of the reservoir. Preliminary modelling shows that 100% of the CO2 will be retained within the reservoir for at least 10,000 years. This demonstrates how small datasets, widely spread, can be adequate for a first stage investigation, and geological uncertainties can be identified for subsequent investigation.

This paper for the international symposium incommemoration of this meaningful anniversary overviewed the four decades of research on the ceramics from the Sinan shipwreck. Originally bound for Japanese consumers who had high demand for Chinese cultural products, the ceramics from the Sinan shipwreck provide important resources for the study of ceramics trade between China and Japan, and probably for this reason, more significant academic achievements have been made in Japan than in Korea. Korean academia lacked in-depth research on the ceramics from the Sinan shipwreck; the whole picture of these ceramics were covered only partially or comprehensively along with other subjects in symposiums or special exhibitions on the Sinan shipwreck.Goryeo and Yuan (元, 1271~1368) exchanged ceramics through diplomatic relations as well as commercial trade. 『Goryeosa 高麗史』 indicates that Yuan had a strong demand for Goryeo celadon, while Goryeo’s demand for Yuan ceramics was limited to special ritual vessels in the late Goryeo period. A small number of Yuan ceramics were introduced to Goryeo by the Yuan Princess and dealers of ceramics amassed fortunes and enjoyed enhanced social status.Compared to the ceramics from the Song (宋, 960~1279), Ming (明, 1368~1344), and Qing (淸, 1636~1912) dynasties, those from the Yuan dynasty were excavated in relatively small number in ancient sites in Korea. This means that among the Yuan ceramics discovered at ancient Goryeo sites, there are not many examples comparable to the salvage from the Sinan shipwreck. Major discovery sites are located along the main route of trading ships-that is, the seabed of the Yellow Sea, the waters of Jejudo, and several historical sites on Jejudo, including the Hangpaduriseong Fortress (缸坡頭里城) and the Beophwasa Temple site (法華寺址). Other sites include Asan, South Chungcheong Province and Sujongsa Temple (水鍾寺) in Namyangju, Gyeonggi Province. It is interesting that a typical Yuan celadon jar was excavated from inside the pagoda of Sujongsa Temple, which is dated to the early Joseon period.The types of ceramics excavated from ancient Goryeo sites are limited to celadon, white porcelain, black-glazed, and earthenware vessels, with Longquan celadon accounting for the largest proportion. Most vessels are for practical use, such as bowls, soup bowls, dishes, bottles, and storage bottles. Examples that feature major characteristics of Yuan ceramics, such as water-droppers or figurines of special shapes or vessels with a new type of design (e.g., applique design, spot design), have not yet been found in ancient Goryeo sites. Compared to the diverse range of vessels from the Sinan shipwreck (e.g., soup bowls, bowls, dishes, bottles, vases, basins, incense burners, water-droppers, candle sticks, ritual vessels), the small quantity of discoveries from ancient Goryeo sites include only a few vessel types.In particular, as there are remarkable similarities among the eight pieces of Yuan celadon wares and one piece of white ware excavated from Onyang-dong (溫陽洞) in Asan, Chungcheongnam-do Province and ceramics from the Sinan shipwreck, investigation is required to clarify their historical context and relations. An in-depth analysis of this issue should be addressed in future studies.Apart from the ceramics from the Sinan shipwreck, few ceramics are known to have been imported into Goryeo from Yuan. On the other hand, large quantities of Goryeo celadon poured into China, both in the form of private trading and as tributes. Therefore, research on Goryeo celadons excavated in Yuan archeological sites should be conducted as a priority in order to gain a deeper understanding of the depth of the actual relationship between the Goryeo and Yuan dynasties. Hopefully, this paper will contribute to research on the Yuan ceramics excavated at the Goryeo archeological sites.",,,,"신안선 발굴은 1976년 10월부터 1984년 9월까지 9년간 실시되었고, 2016년은 신안선 발굴이시작된 지 40주년이 되는 해이다. 이를 기념하여 국립중앙박물관에서 개최하는 국제학술대회에서의 발표를 계기로, 40년간의 신안선 자기에 대한 연구사를 개관하는 것으로 이글을 시작하였다. 신안선의 자기는 일본에서 중국 문물이 유행하면서 크게 선호하던 자기였으므로 사실 한국보다는 중국과 일본의 무역자기 연구에 더 중요한 자료이다. 이런 이유에서인지 국내 연구보다는 일본에서의 연구 성과가 더 풍부하다. 국내 학계에서의 심도 있는 연구는 미흡한 편이었으며, 기념비적인 학술대회나 특별전에서 포괄적인 주제 안에서 자기는 부분적으로 소개되거나 그 내용도 개론적인 수준에 그쳤다.고려와 원의 자기 교류는 왕실, 지배층, 민간 상인을 통한 교류가 비교적 활발했음이 문헌기록에서 발견된다. 『高麗史』 등의 기록에 의하면, 고려 말, 원이 고려 청자에 대한 애호와 구입 욕구가 강했고 고려에서 상인들이 부를 축적했으며 더욱이 사기를 매매하는 상인의 신분도 상승하였다. 원으로부터는 주로 특수한 제기를 구해왔고, 원 공주에 의해 고려 왕실에 원 양식의 자기가 소량이지만 전래되었다고 짐작되고 있다.이에 비해 한국에서 원대 자기의 출토 사례는 송Â·명Â·청대의 자기에 비해 매우 적다. 당연히신안선의 원대 자기와 유사한 고려 유적 출토 원대 자기도 그리 많지 않다. 이런 상황에서 지금까지 한국에서 발견, 조사된 원대 자기를 출토지별로 정리하여 비교해 보았는데, 출토지는 주로 무역선의 운항 경로였던 서해와 제주, 제주의 항파두리성과 법화사지 및 여러 유적, 충남 아산, 경기도 남양주 수종사탑 등이다. 수종사의 경우 조선 초의 사찰이지만 대표적인 원대 청자호가 출토되어 학계의 주목을 끌고 있다.한국의 유적에서 출토된 자기의 종류는 청자, 백자, 흑유, 도기병 등 소량이며 이 가운데 용천요 청자의 비율이 가장 많다. 그릇의 종류는 대부분이 실용적인 대접, 접시, 완, 병, 저장용 도기병 등 몇 가지에 지나지 않는다. 원대에 새로 등장한 각종 형태의 연적, 인물상 등의 특이한 기형이나 露胎貼花文과 鐵斑文 같은 전형적인 원대 자기의 문양 장식은 고려 유적에서는 발견되지 않았다. 이는 대접, 접시, 완 등을 비롯한 각종 병과 화분, 수반, 향로 등 다양한 종류의 신안선 원대 자기에 비하면 매우 간소하다.특히 아산 온양동에서 출토된 원대 청자 8점과 백자 1점은 신안선의 자기와 같은 양식을 보이므로 어떤 역사적 배경에서 신안선 자기 유형이 온양동에서 출토 된 것인지에 대한 고찰이 필요하다. 이에 대한 심도 있는 연구는 뒤로 미루기로 한다.신안선 자기를 제외하면, 고려가 수입한 원 자기의 수량은 적은 반면 원에 공납되거나 개인간의 교역을 통해 원에 들어간 고려 자기의 수량은 많다. 따라서 고려와 원의 관계의 실상을 깊이있게 파악하기 위해서는 원 유적에서 출토된 고려 자기에 대한 연구가 더 절실하다. 이 글이 고려 유적 출토 원 자기의 연구에 도움이 되기를 기대한다.",,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,0540-4568,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2016-12-29,KJD:ART002174310,,

Mariners have to concentrate on maintaining balance as well as be prepared for motion-induced interruptions while performing work-related tasks, such as lifting. The purpose of this study was to assess the effects of a moving platform and load stability on recruitment of selected trunk musculature and thoraco-lumbar kinematics during common lifting tasks.Methods: Nineteen healthy male participants (22.78 +/- 1.72 years, 1.81 +/- .06 m, 82.42 +/- 12.08 kg) were recruited. Loads and conditions were manipulated to determine the effects of instability during manual materials handling tasks. Participants lifted four different loads (10 kg stable, 10 kg unstable, 15 kg stable, 15 kg unstable) onto a shelf in one lab condition and three different ship conditions (roll, quartering seas, and pitch) while wearing EMG electrodes and a Lumbar Motion Monitor (LMM). A repeated measures ANOVA was used to test for significant differences between loads and conditions for both electromyography (EMG) and LMM data.Results: The mean and maximum EMG (% Maximal Voluntary Contraction) showed significant differences across loads for all muscles except the left latissimus dorsi but showed a significant difference across conditions for the left latissimus dorsi only. For all loads, the pitch condition produced the largest maximum sagittal thoraco-lumbar velocities and the lab condition produced the smallest. There were significant mean and maximum thoraco-lumbar velocity differences across conditions in all three planes.Conclusion: The pitch condition proved to be the most difficult condition to maintain stability regardless of whether or not a load was being handled. Motion direction of a platform, occurring during a lifting task, did not significantly increase muscular activity about the selected trunk musculature but did increase significantly thoraco-lumbar kinematics. Lifting unstable loads, compared to stable loads, in movina environments did significantly increase muscular activity about the selected trunk musculature but did not significantly increase thoraco-lumbar kinematics.Relevance to industryRisk management in maritime industries assumes tremendous importance as accidents at sea can result in personnel injury or death and environmental catastrophe. While much is known about the risks of manual materials handling in stable locations, little has been documented about the additive effects of working in motion rich environments. These results demonstrate that load and motion characteristics have specific effects upon operator performance and provide guidance for workstation design and administrative controls for lifting tasks on seagoing vessels.

Key examples include carbon credit markets and environmental water markets. Market demand for carbon credits from sequestration are expected to expand in size and geographic scope as a result of climate action obligations and increased carbon credit tradability provisions in the Paris Agreement on climate change. Market based reallocations of water are also increasingly common. The increased use of markets for multiple and related environmental good provision will inevitably introduce synergies and risks in joint ecosystem service provision. This study assesses water and carbon ecosystem service supply potential for a joint carbon and water market participation strategy using a case study of the lower Murrumbidgee, in the MurrayDarling Basin. The methodology is a dynamic hydro-economic simulation of river flows, floodplain inundation, forest carbon dynamics, carbon credit value, and water opportunity cost. The study results indicate possible synergies in joint provision of carbon sequestration and environmental flow benefits through a carbon-water trading strategy. This involves funds for environmental water purchases generated through sale of carbon credits from improved floodplain conditions. Results identify limited trading opportunities at the current carbon price (AU$13/tCO(2)), resulting in an economically viable re-allocation of 2.31 GL/year (0.1% of water currently diverted for irrigation) to the environment with frequent years of zero re-allocation.

The use of marine and hydrokinetic (MHK) devices to harness the power of wave and tidal energy could contribute significantly toward meeting federal-and state-mandated renewable energy goals while supplying a substantial amount of clean energy to coastal communities. Locations along the eastern and western coasts of the United States between 40 and 70 north latitude are ideal for MHK deployment, and recent estimates of wave and current energy resource potential in the US suggest that up to 400 terawatt hours could be generated, representing about 10% of national energy demand. Because energy derived from wave and tidal devices is highly predictable, their inclusion in our energy portfolio could help balance available sources of energy production, including hydroelectric, coal, nuclear, wind, solar, geothermal, and others.As an emerging industry, MHK energy developers face many challenges associated with the siting, permitting, construction, and operation of pilot and commercial-scale facilities. As the industry progresses, it will be necessary not only to secure financial support and develop robust technologies capable of efficient, continued operation in harsh environments, but also to implement effective monitoring programs to evaluate long-term effects of device operation and assure resource agencies and members of the public that potential environmental impacts are understood and can be addressed.At this time, little is known about the environmental effects of MHK energy generation at pilot-or full-scale operational scenarios. Potential effects could include changes to aquatic species behavior from exposure to electromagnetic fields or operational noise; physical interaction of marine mammals, fish, and invertebrates with operating devices or mooring cables; or changes to beach characteristics and water quality from long-term deployment of devices in coastal locations. This lack of knowledge creates a high degree of uncertainty that affects the actions of regulatory agencies, influences the opinions and concerns of stakeholder groups, affects the commitment of energy project developers and investors, and ultimately, the solvency of the industry.To address the complexity of environmental issues associated with MHK energy, PNNL has received support from the Department of Energy Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy Waterpower Program to develop research and development that draws on the knowledge of the industry, regulators, and stakeholders. Initial research has focused on 1) the development of a knowledge management database and related environmental risk evaluation system, 2) the use of hydrodynamic models to assess the effects of energy removal on coastal systems, 3) the development of laboratory and mesocosm experiments to evaluate the effects of EMF and noise on representative marine and estuarine species, and 4) collaborative interaction with regulators and other stakeholders to facilitate ocean energy devices, including participation in coastal and marine spatial planning activities.In this paper, we describe our approach for initial laboratory investigations to evaluate potential environmental effects of EMFs on aquatic resources. Testing will be conducted on species that are a) easily procured and cultured, b) ecologically, commercially, recreationally or culturally valuable, and c) reasonable surrogates for threatened or endangered species. Biological endpoints of interest are those that provide compelling evidence of magnetic field detection and have a nexus to individual, community, or population-level effects. Through laboratory, mesocosm, and limited field testing, we hope to reduce the uncertainly associated with the development of ocean energy resources, and gain regulatory and stakeholder acceptance. We believe this is the best approach for moving the science forward and provides the best opportunity for successfully applying this technology toward meeting our country's renewable energy needs.During the project, the team will work closely with two other national laboratories (Sandia and Oak Ridge), the Northwest National Marine Renewable Energy Center at University of Washington and Oregon State University, and Pacific Energy Ventures.",,,,,Washington State Conference and Trade Center (WSCTC)Washington State Conference and Trade Center (WSCTC),"SEP 20-23, 2010SEP 20-23, 2010",IEEE; Marine Technol; OESIEEE; Marine Technol; OES,"Seattle, WASeattle, WA",1,0,0,0,0,0,1,,,0197-7385,,978-1-4244-4333-8,,,,,,,,,"Pacific NW Natl Lab, Marine Sci Lab, Sequim, WA 98382 USA",,,,2010-01-01,WOS:000287539100049,,

The Luckenbach sank with no loss of life, but sustained massive structural damage from the collision. which caused the sinking. At the time of her collision and sinking she was in route to Korea with a full cargo of jeeps, trucks and railroad equipment for the Korean War effort. It is estimated that her bunkers were topped off the trip with heavy bunker C oil.In early 2002, the Luckenbach was identified as the source of mystery oil spills along the California coast. In May 2002, Titan-Maritime LLC, with engineers from PCCI, Inc., was contracted by the U.S. Coast Guard, Pacific Area Command, San Francisco, to conduct a vessel assessment and remove available oil.

This requires a shift from oil, gas and coal to agricultural, forestry and marine raw materials and will affect the global processing chains for energy, fuels and chemicals. However, the land required for the production of raw materials is competing with the production of food and animal feed. In addition, future land use must better take into account planetary boundaries and the preservation of ecosystem services. In order to achieve economic, ecological and societal sustainability, the necessary measures must therefore be geared towards the UN's sustainability goals. Against this background, the future bioeconomy will have to concentrate on the food, chemical and heavy fuel sectors. Important sub-areas are alternative animal protein for nutrition, feedstock efficiency in the processing of bio-based raw materials, and the expansion of the raw materials spectrum. This requires enormous investment in industrial facilities, the integration of newly emerging value chains and the necessary infrastructure. The annual global investment requirements for renewable energy, bio-based chemicals and fuels, and ecosystem services is estimated at USD 1-2 trillion over the next three decades, equivalent to about 1.3-2.6% of global GDP.

This partnership offers a unique combination of experience in research, development and knowledge exchange with major industry stakeholders in offshore renewable energy and offshore engineering in the naval architecture and oil and gas sectors. This is complemented by the extensive experience of SAMS in the environmental and societal impacts of offshore renewable energy projects. Large-scale commercial deployment of offshore renewables technology will require development of new techniques and technologies to design, build, install, operate, and maintain devices in hostile environments at affordable economic costs and with minimal environmental impact. The drive to meet the UK's ambitious deployment targets requires a supply of highly trained scientists and engineers to deliver their skills across the sector. The consortium is ideally-placed to support the industry in meeting these challenges through a conjoined infrastructure, which begins in some of the best academic research centres with leading test facilities and extends through a unique combination of demonstration facilities, ultimately to test and deployment sites. The partner universities already collaborate closely through their leadership of UK and European flagship programmes listed below. We propose to form an IDC in Offshore Renewable Energy that will conduct internationally leading research, providing a vibrant training environment and delivering a body of high-quality post-doctoral staff to realise this opportunity. In addition to providing a solid background in professional, technical and transferable skills the IDC training program will develop a tightly knit cohort of highly skilled graduates forming a strong foundation for the future development of the sector. Their training will be innovative and multi-disciplinary, using a variety of delivery methods, and utilising unique experimental facilities (such as Strathclyde University's Wave/Towing tank and advanced materials development and testing facility, the new All UK Waters Combined Current and Wave Test Facility and existing tanks and flumes in Edinburgh, the offshore measurement systems (Wave and ADCP measurement array and surveying), South West Mooring Test Facility (SWMFT), accelerated fatigue testing facilities (DMAC) in Falmouth, and survey vessels in Oban and Exeter) and field study areas provided by the host Universities. Through established links with partner organisations including HR-Wallingford, the European Marine Energy Centre (EMEC), the National Renewable Energy Centre (NaREC), and the WaveHub, students will be placed and, wherever possible site-trained in large-scale test facilities, prototype demonstration and small-farm demonstration sites. The training will also benefit from the extensive experience of the consortium in advanced engineering analysis and simulation, and access to UK-leading computational facilities. The training package offered by the IDC will provide the students with unparalleled engineering experience in applied offshore renewable energy R&D.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,EP/J500847/1,,,,,,,,University of Edinburgh,,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:15399216,,

The importance of using consistent random walk schemes has been known for decades in, e.g., the plankton modelling community. However, it appears not to be common knowledge in the oil spill community, with inconsistent random walk schemes appearing even in recent publications.

This strategy creates economic value from the CH4 production, reduces the preinjection complexity since costly CO2 distillation is circumvented, and limits leakage since hydrate is immobile. Here we explore the phase behavior of these types of injections and describe the individual roles of H2O, CO2, CH4, and N-2 as these components partition into aqueous, vapor, hydrate, and liquid CO2 phases.

Tidal energy has the major advantages of predictability over other nonconventional energy sources and has no carbon emissions. Tidal energy policies have been the main driver for tidal energy project developments, and successful qualifications of high capacity marine current turbines have provided the confidence to establish tidal farms. Transmitting turbine-generated power to the shore power network by laying dedicated umbilical cables is not an economical and reliable solution, as this requires the establishment of local enclosure-based SEGS. This receives power from the multiple turbines in the farm, synthesizes it to the required power levels, and transmits it to the shore power network using a single power take-off umbilical. SEGS breakdowns lead to power production losses, and system retrieval for repair and maintenance is costly and time consuming-and therefore, these systems need to be robust. This paper describes the major technical challenges, such as reliability-centered configuration, efficient interconnection methods, enclosure environment management, and biofouling. Emerging technological advancements are reviewed, and it is found that with the present technical maturity, a single SEGS could handle up to 10 turbines with a mean time between failure of 8.5 and 5.1 years with AC and DC take-off, respectively.",,,,,,,,,9,0,0,0,0,0,9,,,0025-3324,1948-1209,,,,,,,,,,"Natl Inst Ocean Technol, Chennai, Tamil Nadu, IndiaSeaproof Solut, Bergen, Norway",Seaproof Solut,,,2013-11-07,WOS:000324844400009,,

To properly assess the effects of design, fabrication, inspection and repair strategy for structure degradation due to crack growth, Fracture mechanics (FM) models need to be applied. In this paper, alternative S-N and FM formulations of fatigue are investigated. Probabilistic fracture mechanics approach predicts the fatigue life of welded steel structure in the presence of cracks under random spectrum loading. It is based on a recently proposed bi-linear relationship to model fatigue crack growth and incorporates a failure criterion to describe the interaction between fracture and plastic collapse. Uncertainty modeling, especially on fatigue crack growth parameters, is undertaken with the aid of recently published data in support of the bilinear crack growth relationship. Results pertaining to fatigue reliability and fatigue crack size evolution are presented using the Monte Carlo Simulation Technique, and emphasis is placed on a comparison between linear and bi-linear crack growth models. The bi-linear S-N curve and crack growth model are found to lead to hi-her fatique life estimates and shows sensitivity to many other parameters in addition to the stress state of the component.

In the initial stages of mooring and foundation development a large number of possible configuration permutations exist. Filtering of unsuitable designs is possible using information specific to the deployment site (i.e. bathymetry, environmental conditions) and device (i.e. mooring and/or foundation system role and cable connection requirements). The identification of a final solution requires detailed analysis, which includes load cases based on extreme environmental statistics following certification guidance processes. Static and/or quasi-static modelling of the mooring and/or foundation system serves as an intermediate design filtering stage enabling dynamic time-domain analysis to be focused on a small number of potential configurations. Mooring and foundation design is therefore reliant on logical decision making throughout this stage-gate process. The open-source DTOcean (Optimal Design Tools for Ocean Energy Arrays) Tool includes a mooring and foundation module, which automates the configuration selection process for fixed and floating wave and tidal energy devices. As far as the authors are aware, this is one of the first tools to be developed for the purpose of identifying potential solutions during the initial stages of marine renewable energy design. While the mooring and foundation module does not replace a full design assessment, it provides in addition to suitable configuration solutions, assessments in terms of reliability, economics and environmental impact. This article provides insight into the solution identification approach used by the module and features the verification of both the mooring system calculations and the foundation design using commercial software. Several case studies are investigated: a floating wave energy converter and several anchoring systems. It is demonstrated that the mooring and foundation module is able to provide device and/or site developers with rapid mooring and foundation design solutions to appropriate design criteria.",,,,,,,,,5,0,0,0,0,0,5,,,1475-0902,2041-3084,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Exeter, Coll Engn Math & Phys Sci, Renewable Energy, Penryn TR10 9EZ, EnglandSandia Natl Labs, POB 5800, Albuquerque, NM 87185 USATens Technol Int Ltd, Eastbourne, England",Tens Technol Int Ltd,,,2018-04-27,WOS:000429917600009,,

Cluster and factor analyses determined four size groupings of lobsters based on their diet: <7.5 mm, 7.5 to <22.5 mm, 22.5 to <62.5 mm. and greater than or equal to62.5 mm CL. The ontogenetic shift in diet with increasing size of lobsters was especially apparent for the three dominant food items: the contribution of bivalves and animal tissue (flesh) to volume of stomach contents decreased from the smallest lobsters (28% and 39%, respectively) to the largest lobsters (2% and 11%, respectively), whereas the reverse trend was seen for rock crab Cancer irroratus (7% in smallest lobsters to 5317, in largest lobsters). Large lobsters also ate larger rock crabs than did small lobsters. This study is the first to examine the natural diet of shelter-restricted juveniles (SRJs, <4.5 mm CL), which were thought to be principally suspension feeders and to a lesser degree browsers or ambush predators in or near their shelter. However, at our study site no planktonic organisms were identified from the stomachs of SRJs, whereas formaniferans, crustacean meiofauna, and macroalgal debris that could be derived by browsing, together represented only 10-14%, by volume of stomach contents. We infer that SRJs obtained bivalves by predation and flesh by exploiting larger lobsters' meal scraps or food reserves.

An integrated approach to corrosion modeling and testing can enable reliable extension of carbon steel application.The integrated approach to predicting corrosion has five primary elements:1. Rigorously establish the environmental conditions by conducting thermodynamic and compositional hydraulic analyses, and characterize how these conditions are expected to change over time.2. Identify and model the local environmental conditions and the types of corrosion that are expected to occur (e.g., weight loss, pitting, environmental cracking), including sensitivity and upset cases.3. Conduct realistic corrosion tests under the identified field conditions by simulating brine chemistry, dissolved acid gas concentrations, hydrocarbon effects, fluid shear stresses, and flow regimes in appropriate laboratory equipment. Specialized laboratory test apparatus, such as a large-diameter sour multiphase flow loop and large-volume high-pressure high-temperature autoclave test cells, has been designed and constructed to ensure proper replication of field conditions.4. Mathematically extrapolate the results of the laboratory tests to the field, enabling calculation of expected tubular life.5.

This DTC will raise the number of highly qualified materials scientists/engineers and address two major issues. Firstly, insufficient numbers of skilled personnel in Composites technology currently available to UK industry (EPSRC Materials Intl. Review 2008) and secondly, training of people capable of bridging the interface between engineering & science. A further objective is to develop and produce the next generation of Composites, noting that within ACCIS Composites are defined as synergistic combinations of materials which may exhibit multifunctional attributes. Composites offer novel, fundamental solutions for commercial success and environmental sustainability in many engineering endeavours, with enormous future potential.UK Composites is at a critical juncture. For example, materials used in building large passenger aircraft are changing from metallic to Composite, requiring a technological transformation if design and manufacturing are to remain in the UK and ACARE2020 targets (e.g. 50% reduction in CO2 & perceived noise) are to be met. A further example of industrial need is the expected ten-fold increase in wind farms to ensure security of the UK's energy supply. In this case, demand for Composites may even exceed that from the aerospace industry. Overall, industrial use of Composites is rising exponentially. Simultaneously, universities are not currently producing the graduates required to implement technology and advance underlying science, a situation exacerbated by contraction of UK Materials Science departments. Without the necessary skill base and expertise to drive exciting projects and generate intellectual property, there is an overwhelming risk that both existing and nascent industries, and their supply chains, could fail or move offshore. This proposal provides the opportunity to address this challenge, creating an internationally leading DTC encompassing the materials science & engineering of Composites. The centre will contribute significantly to increasing capacity in this strategically important area and firmly establish UK Advanced Composites on the global map.Our industrial letters of support highlight the urgent need to meet current and anticipated future shortages of highly skilled people for cross-sectorial Composites technologies, spanning aerospace, biomaterials, civil infrastructure and energy generation. To meet this need and provide a new generation of Composites innovation, we have a strategy to seek an equal share of industrially supported PhD projects to meet shorter-term industrial needs, coupled with exciting longer-term, blue-skies studies in multifunctional Composites development. Combining this approach with a comprehensive taught progamme, we will deliver highly-skilled Composites practitioners to ensure a flourishing future for this crucial UK sector.The technical aspirations of this DTC are:-to stimulate adventurous research, across length scales and at unexplored interfaces between established Composites research and chemistry, physics, biology and medicine by placing PhDs at the frontiers of and interfaces between these disciplines;-to develop the design methodology and innovative application of Next Generation Composite Materials.The DTC will provide the means to create and deliver a portfolio of PG degrees. A 4-yr programme, including 1-yr taught course, is proposed. This programme is suitable for a range of student backgrounds, exploiting the 1st year as a familiarisation period before their PhD. The modular Programme will also be adapted for part-time students, particularly from industry, to fulfil their training needs. Novel aspects include the proposed researcher exchange programme, annual conference, and comprehensive personal and transferable skills development",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,EP/G036772/1,,,,,,,,University of Bristol,,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:15355132,,

Organic matter decomposition significantly increased in response to nitrate, even at sediment depths typically considered resistant to decomposition. The use of isotope tracers suggests this pattern was largely driven by stimulated denitrification. Nitrate addition also significantly altered the microbial community and decreased alpha diversity, selecting for taxa belonging to groups known to reduce nitrate and oxidize more complex forms of organic matter. Fourier Transform-Infrared Spectroscopy further supported these results, suggesting that nitrate facilitated decomposition of complex organic matter compounds into more bioavailable forms. Taken together, these results suggest the existence of organic matter pools that only become accessible with nitrate and would otherwise remain stabilized in the sediment. The existence of such pools could have important implications for carbon storage, since greater decomposition rates as N loading increases may result in less overall burial of organic-rich sediment. Given the extent of nitrogen loading along our coastlines, it is imperative that we better understand the resilience of salt marsh systems to nutrient enrichment, especially if we hope to rely on salt marshes, and other blue carbon systems, for long-term carbon storage.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2020-06-23,DRCI:DATA2020114018480732,,

The introduction of these azooxanthellate hard corals into Brazil, initially in Rio de Janeiro state, occurred through their fouling of oil and gas platforms from the Campos oil Basin. The two invasive species have successfully expanded along the Brazilian coast and threaten endemic species and biodiversity. The HPLC-MS and GC-MS data suggest the presence of aplysinopsin analogues (alkaloids). Anti-inflammatory activity was observed in all samples tested in in-vivo assays, especially in T. coccinea. The ethyl acetate fraction from this sample was more effective in in-vitro assays for anti-inflammatory activity. Depending on the concentration, this fraction showed cytotoxic responses. Conclusions These species have potential pharmacological use, and considering their invasive nature, this study presents a potential alternative use, which may enhance the management of this biological invasion.",,,,,,,,,4,0,0,0,2,0,4,,,0022-3573,2042-7158,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Estado Rio De Janeiro, Dept Biophys & Biometry, Lab Environm Mutagenesis, Blvd Vinte & Oito Setembro,87 FDS,Vila Isabel, BR-20551900 Rio De Janeiro, RJ, BrazilUniv Estado Rio De Janeiro, Dept Biochem, Lab Appl Biochem & Biochem Prot & Nat Prod, Rio De Janeiro, RJ, BrazilUniv Estado Rio De Janeiro, Dept Ecol, Rio De Janeiro, RJ, BrazilUniv Fed Rio de Janeiro, Inst Chem, Dept Organ Chem, Rio De Janeiro, RJ, Brazil",,,,2020-01-24,WOS:000509108400001,31981225,

Lost circulation or well kick is a typically hazardous event that may occur while drilling wells and it also may develop into a blowout accident without being well handled. It is necessary to identify and analyze the root causes of these events and their consequences, in order to prevent serious accidents from happening. In a drilling operation, the risk of blowout may change with time, depending on the operation stage, and such kind of dynamics should be captured in risk assessment. This paper presents an approach for determining the conditional probabilities of hazardous events and their consequences. The approach includes models that take into account the influence of degradation and (if applicable) new real-time information which represents the changing model parameters (such as state change of mud density). Such an approach is based on the Dynamic Bayesian Network (DBN) theory and then incorporates additional nodes to address the model uncertainties and parameter uncertainties. In addition, the effect of equipment degradation, which had been ignored in the existing researches, also is considered for modeling. Given that a hazardous event has occurred, this presented model can be used to predict the risk evolution, as well to reason its root causes during offshore drilling operation. A bowtie model is established to link the potential incident scenarios with the pressure regimes and formation load capacity, and then the model is translated into a DBN. DBN inference is adapted to perform prediction and diagnosis for dynamic risk assessment, and then a sensitivity analysis is carried out to find the relative importance of each root cause. A case study with focusing on lost circulation during three drilling scenarios is adapted to illustrate the feasibility of the proposed approach. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

The injections of chemicals such as methanol and corrosion inhibitors, etc., downstream of the meter, and possible liquid separation or hold-up, are typical issues. Employing subsea multiphase flowmetre measurements in the underwater environment presents some significant challenges. Due to the fact that subsea multiphase flowmetre is not 'fit-and-forget' instrumentation hardware, changes in the inputs from the flow stream's actual properties can lead to errors in flowmetre data capture. A mechanistic model is employed, using the fluid properties that are equivalent to the flow stream being measured, to predict reliable reservoir fluid characteristics on the production flow stream.

Although, most of the contaminants fall below the detection limits within a short distance from the discharge port, a few of the remaining contaminants including naturally occurring radioactive materials (NORM) are of concern due to their bioavailability in the media and bioaccumulation characteristics in finfish and shellfish species used for human consumption. In the past, several initiatives have been taken to model human health risk from NORM in produced water. The parameters of the available risk assessment models are imprecise and sparse in nature. In this study, a fuzzy possibilistic evaluation using fuzzy rule based modeling has been presented. Being conservative in nature, the possibilistic approach considers possible input parameter values; thus provides better environmental prediction than the Monte Carlo, (MC) calculation. The uncertainties of the input parameters were captured with fuzzy triangular membership functions (TFNs). Fuzzy if-then rules were applied for input concentrations of two isotopes of radium, namely (226)Ra, and (228)Ra, available in produced water and bulk dilution to evaluate the radium concentration in fish tissue used for human consumption. The bulk dilution was predicted using four input parameters: produced water discharge rate, ambient seawater velocity, depth of discharge port and density gradient. The evaluated cancer risk shows compliance with the regulatory guidelines; thus minimum risk to human health is expected from NORM components in produced water. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

As a result, one of the main concern of either industrial or environmental managers is the identification and assessment of such risks in order to develop and maintain appropriate proactive measures. Oil spill from stationary sources in offshore zones is one of the accidents resulting in several adverse impacts on marine ecosystems. Considering a site's current situation and relevant requirements and standards, risk assessment process is not only capable of recognizing the probable causes of accidents but also of estimating the probability of occurrence and the severity of consequences. In this way, results of risk assessment would help managers and decision makers create and employ proper control methods. Most of the represented models for risk assessment of oil spills are achieved on the basis of accurate data bases and analysis of historical data, but unfortunately such data bases are not accessible in most of the zones, especially in developing countries, or else they are newly established and not applicable yet. This issue reveals the necessity of using expert systems and fuzzy set theory. By using such systems it will be possible to formulize the specialty and experience of several experts and specialists who have been working in petroliferous areas for several years. On the other hand, in developing countries often the damages to environment and environmental resources are not considered as risk assessment priorities and they are approximately underestimated.

The method is demonstrated using a model Wind Farm, and defines a physical measure of their energy productivity for society (EROI-S), a ratio of total energy delivered to total energy expended. Energy use records for technology and proxy measures for clearly understood but not individually recorded energy uses for services are combined for a whole system estimate of consumption required for production. Current methods count only energy needs for technology. Business services outsource their own energy needs to operate, leaving no traceable record. That uncounted business energy demand is often 80% of the total, an amount of dark energy hidden from view, discovered by finding the average energy estimated needs for businesses far below the world average energy consumed per dollar of GDP. Presently for lack of information the energy needs of business services are counted to be 0. Our default assumption is to treat them as average. The result is a hard measure of total business demand for energy services, a Scope 4 energy use or GHG impact assessment. Counting recorded energy uses and discounting unrecorded ones misrepresents labor intensive work as highly energy efficient. The result confirms a similar finding by Hall et al. in 1981 [1]. We use exhaustive search for what a business needs to operate as a whole, tracing internal business relationships rather than energy data, to locate its natural physical boundary as a working unit, and so define a business as a physical rather than statistical subject of scientific study.

Fire frequency has the potential to shift considerably in the future. These shifts may alter demographic processes and growth of tree species, and consequently carbon storage in forests. Examination of the sensitivity of forest carbon to the potential upper and lower extremes of fire frequency will provide crucial insight into the magnitude of possible change in carbon stocks associated with shifts in fire frequency. This study examines how tree biomass and demography of a eucalypt forest regenerating after harvest is affected by two experimentally manipulated extremes in fire frequency (i.e., similar to 3 year fire intervals vs. unburnt) sustained over a 23 year period. The rate of post-harvest biomass recovery of overstorey tree species, which constituted similar to 90% of total living tree biomass, was lower within frequently burnt plots than unburnt plots, resulting in approximately 20% lower biomass in frequently burnt plots by the end of the study. Significant differences in carbon biomass between the two extremes in frequency were only evident after >15-20 years of sustained treatment. Reduced growth rates and survivorship of smaller trees on the frequently burnt plots compared to unburnt plots appeared to be driving these patterns. The biomass of understorey trees, which constituted similar to 10% of total living tree biomass, was not affected by frequent burning.

In the scenario it is based on, CCS will provide approximately 20% of the total CO2 emissions reductions out to 2050. To achieve this contribution, an ambitious CCS growth path will be required, with around 100 projects needed globally by 2020, and over 3000 by 2050.As a result of the required CCS expansion, a number of regulatory issues associated with protecting public health, safety and the environment, as well as ensuring stewardship for permanent CO2 storage, will need to be addressed. There is also a need to provide flexible, adaptive regulations for the first set of demonstration projects. To address these issues, governments are amending existing resource extraction or environmental impact frameworks to allow the first demonstration projects to move forward, while at the same time developing dedicated legal frameworks to facilitate CCS commercialisation for the longer-term. In some cases, project-specific regulations may also be needed.In recent years, the international community has amended a number of legal instruments to advance CCS development. The London Protocol was amended in 2006 to allow for offshore CO2 storage and in 2009 to allow for cross -border transport of CO2; in 2007, the OSPAR Convention adopted similar provisions. The UNFCCC does not include a firm commitment for parties with regard to CCS; however, in 2006, the IPCC released the revised Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories, which are used for calculating and reporting national GHG emissions and removals. Although not yet officially sanctioned for use, these guidelines include a complete methodology for the treatment of CCS under the Kyoto Protocol to the UNFCCC and currently have to be used in Kyoto Protocol Annex 1 countries (industrialised), but not yet by non-Annex 1 countries (developing).In parallel, many countries are developing comprehensive domestic regulatory frameworks for CCS. Dedicated legal frameworks enable CCS activities either through licensing regimes or by providing regulatory support for the financing of demonstration projects. The European Commission's 2008 CCS Directive establishes a regulatory framework for the geological storage of CO2. Australia has also enacted comprehensive state and national CCS regulatory frameworks for CO2 storage. Additionally, regulations are currently being pursued in the United States, Canada, Norway and Japan.To assist in the rapid deployment of CCS in line with the recent findings of the IEA CCS Roadmap, the IEA, with assistance from Carbon Counts, Reed Smith LLP and UCL CCLP, has developed the IEA CCS Model Regulatory Framework, which is intended to serve as a tool to assist governments around the world in the development of national regulatory frameworks. The Model Framework draws from current CCS regulatory developments in Europe, Australia, the USA, and elsewhere, to ensure that the work done in these countries can be leveraged around the world. The IEA, through this analysis, provides non-prescriptive assistance in CCS regulatory development to countries looking to develop their own domestic framework.This paper discusses the major features of the IEA CCS Model Regulatory Framework and how it can be best distributed and used to assist in the development of regulatory frameworks in all key regions of the world.

The BRD WEC was developed by a research group at Shandong University (Weihai). The WEC consists of three main functional modules including buoy, generator and mooring modules. The designed rated power capacity is 10 kW. The LCA modeling is based on data collected from actual design, prototype manufacturing, installation and onsite sea test. Life cycle inventory (LCI) analysis and life cycle impact analysis (LCIA) were conducted. The analyses show that the most significant environmental impact contributor is identified to be the manufacturing stage of the BRD WEC due to consumption of energy and materials. Potential improvement approaches are proposed in the discussion. The LCI and LCIA assessment results are then benchmarked with results from reported LCA studies of other WECs, tidal energy converters, as well as offshore wind and solar PV systems. This study presents the energy and carbon intensities and paybacks with 387 kJ/kWh, 89 gCO(2)/kWh, 26 months and 23 months respectively. The results show that the energy and carbon intensities of the BRD WEC are slightly larger than, however comparable, in comparison with the referenced WECs, tidal, offshore wind and solar PV systems. A sensitivity analysis was carried out by varying the capacity factor from 20-50%.

Three dispersants (Corexit 9500A, Corexit 9527A and SPC 1000) were used to prepare dispersed water accommodated oil (DWAO). While higher doses of dispersants dispersed more n-alkanes and PAHs, Corexit 9500A preferentially dispersed C11-C20 n-alkanes, whereas Corexit 9527A was more favorable for smaller alkanes (C10-C16), and SPC 1000 for C12-C28 n-alkanes. Sorption of petroleum hydrocarbons on sediment was proportional to TPH types/fractions in the DWAOs. Addition of 18 mg/L of Corexit 9500A increased sediment uptake of 2-3 ring PAHs, while higher dispersant doses reduced the uptake, due to micelle-enhanced solubilization effects. Both dispersed n-alkanes and PAHs were susceptible to photodegradation under simulated sunlight. For PAHs, both photodegradation and photo-facilitated alkylation were concurrently taking place. The information can facilitate sounder assessment of fate and distribution of dispersed oil hydrocarbons in marine systems. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

This study investigated CO2-water-rock interactions under simulated hydrothermal conditions via physicochemical analyses and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Mass loss measurement and SEM showed that corrosion of feldspars, silica, and clay minerals increased with increasing temperature. Corrosion of sandstone samples in the CO2-containing fluid showed a positive correlation with temperature. During reaction at 70 degrees C, 85 degrees C, and 100 degrees C, gibbsite (an intermediate mineral product) formed on the sample surface. This demonstrated mineral capture of CO2 and supported the feasibility of geologic CO2 sequestration. Chemical analyses suggested a dissolution-reprecipitation mechanism underlying the CO2-water-rock interactions. The results of this study suggested that mineral dissolution, new mineral precipitation, and carbonic acid formation-dissociation are closely interrelated in CO2-water-rock interactions.

The emergency plan and responses for such disasters under Brazilian jurisdiction is defined by National Council of the Environment (CONAMA), however, there is only a shy effort by the Brazilian scientific community to research the chemical and biological impacts of oil spill on the environment and human health, creating a considerable deficiency in fundamental knowledge and understating in this area. Accordingly, there is a critical gap of knowledge, yet to be explored, regarding the impact of anthropogenic activities from the oil and gas sector to the environment, e.g., levels of contaminants found in sediments and waters. For instance, the complete scope of 'emerging' organic contaminants from oil spills in water and sediments is still unknown, due to overwhelmingly complex nature of such samples. Some hydrocarbons are commonly adopted as markers to trace oil spills in aquatic and terrestrial environments. Furthermore, polar organic compounds that migrate from petroleum to water are extremely toxic to aquatic organisms and may be persistent in the environment. However, the identification and quantitation of such markers and compounds is not a trivial task, requiring the successful application of highly selective and sensitive methods, which requires an integrated approach by combining different analytical techniques. A clear understanding of the composition of such contaminants is necessary to plan emergency responses to oil spill, since the 'simple' removal of oil from water and sediments is palliative and does not effectively address the treatment of contaminated waters and soils. Accordingly, little is known about the short- and long-term effects of such contaminants in aquatic ecosystems and the real impact on human health and local economy, namely, fishing and tourism. In this context, this research proposal aims the development of reliable methods to characterize real oil samples collected in the shores of Pernambuco and also samples generated from off- and on-shore oil spill experiments. The compositional investigation of such complex mixtures will rely on ultra-high resolution and high accuracy mass spectrometry hyphenated to chromatographic techniques (i.e., GC/MS, GC×GC/MS e LC/MS). The ecotoxicology effects of such contaminated soils and waters will be assessed using Tisbe biminiensis crustacean. The integration chemical and biological analyses will be guided by the effect-direct analysis by establishing valid and reliable chemometric models. These results should improve our understanding on the environmental impacts of oil spills, update standard methods for chemical analyses, and aid in planning treatments for contaminated soils and waters. To successfully accomplish these goals, this multidisciplinary proposal is sedimented on a team of researchers from Brazilian institutions and well-established north American researchers by exchanging fundamental knowledge through meetings and technical visiting.

Concomitant with this was a postulated massive addition Of CO2 to the atmospheric carbon reservoir by impact vaporisation of the Chicxulub carbonate platform. Taken together, a high CO2 but low irradiance environment would have created unusual conditions for the operation of the terrestrial biosphere. Here, we have evaluated this environmental influence on terrestrial ecosystems using a process-based dynamic global vegetation model forced with post-impact global climates, derived by modification of the GENESIS atmospheric climate model simulation for the latest Cretaceous. Our results suggest that terrestrial primary prod-activity initially collapsed and then recovered to pre-impact levels within a decade. Global terrestrial carbon storage in vegetation biomass exhibited a similar collapse but complete recovery took place on a 60-80 yr timescale. The recovery of both terrestrial net primary productivity and vegetation biomass was largely mediated by the high CO2 concentration stimulating ecosystem photosynthetic productivity in the warm low latitudes. An apparently rapid recovery of terrestrial ecosystem function stands in marked contrast to the situation for the marine realm, where the organic carbon flux to the deep ocean was suppressed for up to 3 million years.

Oil may sink as burn residue, microscopic oil-particle aggregates (OPAs) or macroscopic oil-sediment mixtures (OSMs), marine oil snow during a MOSSFA event, or due to its high density. The most common mechanism is by sediment en-trainment, and in such scenarios manual recovery has been reported as a successful response option.

This fact demonstrates the importance of studying the preconditions for, and the process of, hydrocarbon degradation as well as the competing processes which prevent or slow them down. This paper deals with the preconditions of biodegradation: the presence of water, the availability of oxygen, the influence of temperature and the presence and type of degrading microorganisms. This paper discusses abiotic transformation as well as aerobic and anaerobic biodegradation., The importance of emulsification and hydrocarbon uptake into the degrading microorganisms is underlined. Competing processes include the conversion of liquid oil to viscous and finally solid material, the formation of solid sediment-oil mixtures and the clogging of sediment pores preventing oxygen from entering the pores. At first glance, the competing processes seem more geological while emulsification and hydrocarbon uptake seem more biological. However, since the necessary energy input (e.g., waves and turbulence) is geo(physical), it becomes clear, on the one hand, that the biological process requires geophysical energy input and, on the other hand, is inhibited by geological competition. Oil pollution as well as remediation progress affect the impacted environment since they leave undegradable residues and intermediates as well as microbial biomass and its conversion products. Sediments are enriched with organic matter, whose properties and behaviour are altered. Even inorganic matter may be formed during hydrocarbon biodegradation.The final part of this paper consists of case studies of the accident of the tanker BRAER (1993), the oil spill in the Arabian Gulf (199 1), and the continual seeping of the wreck PRESTIGE (2002/03). These three cases demonstrate the importance of oil type, energy input, climatic conditions, as well as human interest in the use of the impacted coast, in determining speed and success of remediation and possible restoration measures.

Here we report on investigations of PACs (47 compounds) in three species of forage fish collected during the 2012-2013 Joint Oil Sands Monitoring Program (JOSMP) fish health investigations and compare results with PAC data for sediment and water collected under JOSMP and earlier programs. PAC concentrations in sediments varied three orders in magnitude and were highest at downstream tributary mouths, which flowed through the exposed McMurray Formation, and along reaches of the Athabasca River where the formation was exposed. PAC concentrations in water were less variable but with higher concentrations near exposed bitumen beds. Forage fish exhibited the weakest spatial gradients in Sigma PACs concentration, which averaged 102 +/- 32 ng/g in trout-perch from the Athabasca River, 125 +/- 22 ng/g in lake chub from the Ells River, and 278 +/- 267 ng/g in slimy sculpin from the Steepbank, Firebag, and Dunkirk Rivers. Low-molecular weight compounds, particularly naphthalenes and fluorenes, dominated fish PACs. Phenanthrenes occurred in greater percent composition in fish caught in areas where PAC concentrations in sediments were higher due to the proximity of bitumen sources than in other areas. Dibenzothiophene, a major component of bitumen PAC was a minor component of fish Sigma PACs. Forage fish PAC concentrations were below fish consumption guidelines established by the European Commission (2011) and for the reopening of the commercial fisheries closed by the Deepwater Horizon oil spill. PAC concentrations in forage fish were similar to concentrations observed in many other studies (fish market surveys, estuaries, and marine waters) and lower than in fish sampled from highly impacted areas (near refineries, harbors, and other industrialized areas).

The coastal peat swamp forests of Sarawak, Malaysian Borneo, are undergoing rapid conversion, predominantly into oil palm plantations. This wetland ecosystem is assumed to have experienced insignificant disturbance in the past, persisting under a single ecologically-stable regime. However, there is limited knowledge of the past disturbance regime, long-term functioning and fundamentally the resilience of this ecosystem to changing natural and anthropogenic perturbations through time. 2. In this study, long-term ecological data sets from three degraded peatlands in Sarawak were collected to shed light on peat swamp forest dynamics. Fossil pollen and charcoal were counted in each sedimentary sequence to reconstruct vegetation and investigate responses to past environmental disturbance, both natural and anthropogenic. 3. Results demonstrate that peat swamp forest taxa have dominated these vegetation profiles throughout the last c. 2000-year period despite the presence of various drivers of disturbance. Evidence for episodes of climatic variability, predominantly linked to ENSO events, and wildfires is present throughout. However, in the last c. 500 years, burning and indicators of human disturbance have elevated beyond past levels at these sites, concurrent with a reduction in peat swamp forest pollen. 4. Two key insights have been gained through this palaeoecological analysis: (i) peat swamp forest vegetation has demonstrated resilience to disturbance caused by burning and climatic variability in Sarawak in the late Holocene, however (ii) coincident with increased fire combined with human impact c. 500 years ago, these communities started to decline. 5. Synthesis. Sarawak's coastal peat swamps have demonstrated resilience to past natural disturbances, with forest vegetation persisting through episodes of fire and climatic variability. However, palaeoecological data presented here suggest that recent, anthropogenic disturbances are of a greater magnitude, causing the observed decline in the peat swamp forest communities in the last c. 500 years and challenging the ecosystem's persistence. This study greatly extends our knowledge of the ecological functioning of these understudied ecosystems, providing baseline information on the past vegetation and its response to disturbance. This understanding is central to developing management strategies that foster resilience in the remaining peat swamp forests and ensure continued provision of services, namely carbon storage, from this globally important ecosystem.

The study team carried out and analyzed 63 h of interviews with pilots, co-pilots, managers and human resources personnel of some of the main helicopter-operating companies. About 80% of the oil extracted in Brazil comes from this Basin, a 3 h drive north of Rio de Janeiro city. The oil company hires nine helicopter-operating companies to transport about 40,000 people who work on ships and platforms every month. The main goal of this project is to discover how the transport system is resilient and brittle, given the workload demands and economic pressures.

Risers are an essential part of any offshore drilling facility. A riser tensioner located on the drilling platform has to provide an adequate vertical tension to maintain the stability of the riser. It is essential for a successful operation. Composite risers in deep sea conditions require much lower top vertical forces due to their high strength to weight ratio. Carbon/epoxy composite has been considered in the present study to carry out the burst analysis and to assess the safety of the composite riser under internal and external pressures and other environmental loads due to random sea currents. In order to ensure the permissible pressure and no fluid leakage, composite risers are provided with an internal steel liner. Initiation and propagation of debonding between the liner and composite has been studied and probability of failure is obtained. In burst analysis, maximum internal pressure is applied to a riser section and the stresses in all (hoop and longitudinal layers) the composite layers are checked against the failure. High pressures are incremented in small steps until fiber rupture occurs due to bursting. Maximum normal stress theory is employed for checking the failure. The same theory provides the limit-state to assess the safe pressure considering uncertainties associated with random input parameters involved. A finite element analysis has been carried out in ABAQUS/AQUA for random sea motion and fluctuating axial tension considering salient non-linearities. A small riser section modelled as a hybrid beam element (for global analysis) has been considered to study the bursting and debonding behavior. It is further discretized into thin shell elements (S4R). Steel liner and composite pipes are modeled separately and assembled together to ensure the overlapping various layers and sharing nodes. The composite body sustains the major stresses in the inner layers that diminish on moving outwards radially. An implicit time domain analysis has been carried out to obtain the response.

The voluntary nature of the system implies that some fishermen adopted the CCS and others did not, generating in the latter a natural control group for evaluating the effect of the regulation. We used the stochastic frontier model to estimate technical inefficiency and a difference-in-difference approach to identify the effect of the regulatory change on the performance of vessels that joined the CCS, while controlling for the behavior of the vessels that remained in the common pool system. The introduction of cooperative catch shares in the sardine and anchovy fishery reduced technical efficiency in the vessels that adopted the CCS, on average.

Most of the drilling fluids used in Brazil are not aqueous because they have an organic base and have been classified as synthetic base fluids. The drill cuttings contaminated by this organic compound must be separated from the drilling fluid for later disposal in the environment. Drying technology through microwaves has shown promise by reaching contaminant levels of below 1%. However, there is currently no device on an industrial scale which is both efficient and reliable in the treatment of drill cuttings with low energy consumption that is capable of reaching residual contaminant contents (< 1%). Therefore, in this study a unit for microwave drying has been developed on an industrial scale in continuous feed, to the remediation of drill cuttings. The equipment has been tested in real conditions of operation, using mass flow rates between 250 and 750 kg/h and organic initial contents of 7.5, 10 and 12.5%. Drill cuttings of offshore type and also pre-salt layers have been evaluated. The results have shown that the proposed device has the capacity to process mass flow rates up to 750 kg/h and is able to reduce the residual contents of hydrocarbons from drilling fluid to 0.1% at a mass flow rate of 250 kg/h, with commercially variable energy consumption.

The small amplitude vibrations induced by the equipment reduce the ground resistance which allows penetration under the action of a relatively small axial force. The technique offers an alternative to impact driving due to lower installation costs and reduced environmental disturbance (noise, vibration, etc.) especially in sensitive environments, such as industrial and urban sites or offshore wind farm sites. The vibratory technique is also preferred when the maximum stress levels imparted to the driven element are of concern. Despite the advantages of the vibratory driving technique, its application remains however mainly driven by pragmatic aspects. Within that context, the access to experience databases and full-scale field test results is of valuable interest. The aim of this paper is to review the Hypervib1 model developed by (Holeyman 1993) for assessing the vibratory drivability of piles and sheet piles, based on the analysis of such experimental results.

However, the mechanisms responsible for the release of the deeply sequestered carbon to the atmosphere at deglaciation, and the relative importance of deep ocean sequestration in regulating millennial-timescale variations in atmospheric CO2 concentration before the Last Glacial Maximum, have remained unclear. Here we present sedimentary redox-sensitive trace-metal records from the Antarctic Zone of the Southern Ocean that provide a reconstruction of transient changes in deep ocean oxygenation and, by inference, respired carbon storage throughout the last glacial cycle. Our data suggest that respired carbon was removed from the abyssal Southern Ocean during the Northern Hemisphere cold phases of the deglaciation, when atmospheric CO2 concentration increased rapidly, reflecting-at least in part-a combination of dwindling iron fertilization by dust and enhanced deep ocean ventilation. Furthermore, our records show that the observed covariation between atmospheric CO2 concentration and abyssal Southern Ocean oxygenation was maintained throughout most of the past 80,000 years. This suggests that on millennial timescales deep ocean circulation and iron fertilization in the Southern Ocean played a consistent role in modifying atmospheric CO2 concentration.",,,,,,,,,161,9,0,0,35,0,179,,,0028-0836,1476-4687,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Bern, Inst Geol Sci, Bern, SwitzerlandUniv Bern, Oeschger Ctr Climate Change Res, Bern, SwitzerlandMcGill Univ, Dept Earth & Planetary Sci, Montreal, PQ, CanadaICREA, Barcelona, SpainUniv Autonoma Barcelona, Inst Ciencia & Tecnol Ambientals, E-08193 Barcelona, SpainUniv Autonoma Barcelona, Dept Math, E-08193 Barcelona, SpainSwiss Fed Inst Technol, Inst Geol, Zurich, SwitzerlandMax Planck Inst Chem, Climate Geochem Dept, Mainz, GermanyColumbia Univ, Lamont Doherty Earth Observ, Palisades, NY USA",,,,2016-02-11,WOS:000369916700036,26840491,

However, exploitation at sea comes with significant design, installation, grid connection, and maintenance operations challenges. Consequently, guidelines and standards are required to ensure safety, quality, performance and accelerate tidal turbines development and commercialisation. Standardisation is also a necessity to support and improve safety and confidence of a wide range of Marine Renewable Energy (MRE) stakeholders such as designers, project operators, investors, insurers or final users.There are undergoing developments on guidelines, standards and certification systems within the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) Technical Committee TC 114 Marine energy- Wave, tidal and other water current converters and the IEC Renewable Energy Marine Energy Operational Management Committee (IECRE ME OMC). However, as the tidal energy concepts are only at the demonstration stage, only few guidelines and no dedicated certification scheme has been published so far within this organization, which guarantee an international, independent, non-governmental and consensus-based elaboration process.The aim of this paper is to present a proposal of certification methodology, developed by Bureau Veritas for the design assessment of current and tidal turbines, and its application to a French case study. This certification procedure was developed within the French research project Sabella D10 funded by ADEME and is published in the Bureau Veritas guideline NI603 Current & Tidal Turbines.The suggested certification procedure addresses prototype, component, type and project certification. Main objective, scope, intermediary steps to be completed and resulting certificates will be detailed for each certification scheme, as well as their interactions.This methodology will be illustrated by the case study on the Sabella D10 prototype, a French tidal turbine installed in 2015 in the Fromveur Passage, off Ushant Island. Sabella D10 is a 1 MW tidal turbine fully submerged laid on the seabed with a horizontal axis and 6 blades. It is the first French tidal turbine producing electricity and connected to the electrical network.The Sabella D10 case study will focus on prototype certification and computations performed for support structure and blades. The paper will describe the load cases that have been considered, the review procedure for the support structure and the blades design assessment, including description of a streamlined method for basic design and a detailed method for final design.

To understand the effects of restoration, net ecosystem exchange (NEE) was measured with the eddy covariance technique in three urban tidal brackish wetland sites over three years: an organic matter amended restored site, a non-amended restored site and a natural (non-restored) wetland site. Our results showed all three sites to be a CO2 source in the wintertime reverting to a weak sink of CO2 in the summer and annually to be sources of CO2 for some of the sites for some of the time. However, the amended restored wetland was found to have the highest release of CO2. Annual destructive harvest of the major species at these wetlands (Spartina ssp and Phragmites australis) did not show significant differences in the aboveground net primary productivity and leaf area over the course of this study. Overall, aboveground biomass production of the three wetlands sites was within the expected range of tidal brackish marshes, but the sites differed in their NEE, ecosystem respiration, and gross ecosystem production. This investigation suggests that CO2 uptake and potential subsequent carbon sequestration may be strongly affected by the management and restoration history of the wetlands, and in our case these wetlands are often acting as a source of CO2, and not as a sink, as may have been expected.",,,,,,,,,14,0,0,0,11,0,17,,,0168-1923,1873-2240,,,,,,,,,,"Rutgers State Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Newark, NJ 07102 USARutgers State Univ, Dept Earth & Environm Sci, Newark, NJ 07102 USABattelle Mem Inst, Natl Ecol Observ Network, 1685 38th St Suite 100, Boulder, CO 80301 USA",Battelle Mem Inst,,,2019-09-15,WOS:000480376400019,,

However, intermediate sulfur species with different valence states, such as polythionates and polysulfides have been detected in several produced water samples, likely a result of phase partitioning, and chemical and microbial reactions. These sulfur species could affect the microbial communities (e.g., microbially influenced corrosion) and will impact the efficiency of souring mitigation methods. In addition, the presence of these sulfur species can result in operational, environmental, and treatment problems. Therefore, development and implementation of souring control strategies during production cycle of oil and gas reservoirs require identifying the origins, reactivity, and the partitioning behaviour of these compounds. This paper presents an overview of the known mechanisms responsible for reservoir souring and then focuses on the chemical reactions and sulfur species associated with production and consumption of hydrogen sulfide. In this work we highlight complexity of the sulfur chemistry and that the assumption that all the sulfate is reduced to hydrogen sulfide can lead to inappropriate souring management methods. The paper also reviews the detection and analysis methods used for sulfur compounds. The review demonstrates that there is a gap in the current souring models and methods due to the exclusion of key sulfur compounds and challenges in identifying and quantifying these compounds with respect to speed of analysis and sample stability.",,,,,,,,,19,0,0,0,6,0,20,,,2190-0558,2190-0566,,,,,,,,,,"Mem Univ Newfoundland, Fac Engn & Appl Sci, St John, NF, Canada",,,,2019-05-15,WOS:000466026400024,,

We compared individual-tree selection and group selection with replanting conifers after clearcutting and no harvest scenarios. Ignoring risk of wildfire or forest health problems, we found that the crowded, untreated stand stored the most carbon per acre in live trees. Among the scenarios involving harvesting, high-density individual-tree selection had the greatest carbon storage because the higher density afforded high levels of production and storage of carbon in live trees. Conversion toward conifer dominance was rapid when conifers were replanted after clearcutting or low-density individual-tree selection (preferentially removing hardwood while releasing existing and planted conifers). Group selection had high harvest yields. Implementing group selection and managing the forested matrix between openings gave a steadier flow of sawlogs and residues; however, less carbon was being stored per acre in live trees growing vigorously within and between openings.

Energy efficiency could be calculated by the ratio of average energy input cost to the average useable energy output cost while energy price could be measured by the ratio of the monetary input to the output.

In our simulations, African, American and South Asian forests, which have high proportions of animal-dispersed species, consistently show carbon losses (2-12%), but Southeast Asian and Australian forests, where there are more abiotically dispersed species, show little to no carbon losses or marginal gains (+/- 1%). These patterns result primarily from changes in wood volume, and are underlain by consistent relationships in our empirical data (similar to 2,100 species), wherein, large-seeded animal-dispersed species are larger as adults than small-seeded animal-dispersed species, but are smaller than abiotically dispersed species. Thus, floristic differences and distinct dispersal mode-seed size-adult size combinations can drive contrasting regional responses to defaunation.",,,,,,,,,77,0,0,0,61,0,82,,,,2041-1723,,,,,,,,,,"Tata Inst Fundamental Res, Natl Ctr Biol Sci, GKVK Campus,Bellary Rd, Bangalore 560065, Karnataka, IndiaNat Conservat Fdn, 3076-5 4 Cross,Gokulam Pk, Mysore 570002, Karnataka, IndiaDuke Univ, Ctr Trop Conservat, Durham, NC 27705 USAOrg Trop Studies, La Selva Biol Stn, Puerto Viejo de Sarapiqui, Heredia, Costa RicaCSIRO Land & Water, Trop Forest Res Ctr, POB 780, Atherton, Qld 4883, AustraliaForest Res Inst Malaysia FRIM, Kepong 52109, Selangor Darul, MalaysiaWildlife Conservat Soc WCS Congo Program, BP 14537, Brazzaville, Rep CongoSmithsonian Trop Res Inst, Ctr Trop Forest Sci, Apartado 0843-03092, Panama City, PanamaWageningen Univ, Dept Environm Sci, Box 47, NL-6700 AA Wageningen, NetherlandsSmithsonian Inst, Dept Bot, CTFS ForestGEO, NMNH MRC 166, POB 37012, Washington, DC 20013 USAUniv York, Dept Environm, CIRCLE, York YO10 5DD, N Yorkshire, EnglandFlamingo Land Ltd, Kirby Misperton YO17 6UX, N Yorkshire, EnglandInst Francais Pondichery, 11 St Louis St, Pondicherry 605001, IndiaMUSE Sci Museum Trento, Corso Lavoro Sci 3, I-38122 Trento, ItalyUniv Leeds, Sch Biol, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England",Nat Conservat FdnOrg Trop StudiesWildlife Conservat Soc WCS Congo ProgramFlamingo Land LtdInst Francais PondicheryMUSE Sci Museum Trento,,,2016-04-01,WOS:000374682800001,27108957,

O.",,,,,,,,,,PROACTIVE INDICATORS TO CONTROL RISKS IN OPERATIONS OF OIL AND GAS FIELDS,,,,,,,,SAFETY SCIENCE MONITOR,,,,17,2,,,,,2,,,,,,,,,,Article,2013,2013,"Due to increased need for oil and gas, new and more demanding oil fields must be explored in sensitive and challenging areas. Exploration of expert knowledge and new technology must be employed in these challenging situations. This collaboration and use of new technology introduces new ways of operating oil and gas fields. These new practices are often called field of the future or integrated operations (IO). These new practices are being implemented on the Norwegian continental shelf, leading to increased hydrocarbon recovery and changes in operations and maintenance. These practices may impact health, safety and environment (HSE), but should not increase the risks of major accidents or influence HSE in a negative manner.In this paper we are suggesting a set of proactive indicators to ensure that risks are controlled when IO is implemented and operated. A proactive indicator is used as a measure of risk, to be controlled in risk management. The indicators have been developed based on analysis of accidents, exploration of theory, interviews and discussions in collaboration with the oil and gas industry.Our suggested approach is to develop and explore indicators in close collaboration between key stakeholders to increase understanding and control of the relevant risks. Resilience and successful recoveries are not sufficiently explored in the accident reports that has been reviewed, thus accident investigations should include reflections on reasons of successful recoveries and why the incident or accident did not have worse consequences.The three most important causal factors of incidents seem to be poor design and poor validation of equipment, poor risk analysis of critical operations and deviations from established procedures. A causal factor important in remote operations is miscommunication between actors during critical operations. Several proactive indicators are suggested, among them the level of exploration of safety cases during design and risk perception among stakeholders involved in operations. Important indicators in remote operations are suggested to be the assessment of shared communication and shared risk perceptions when critical tasks are distributed.To validate the indicators, we are correlating the indicators with actual HSE levels. In addition the indicators should be correlated to indirect measures such as safety culture and risk perceptions where appropriate.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,1443-8844,,,,,,,,,,,"NTNU & SINTEF, Trondheim, Norway",,,,2013-01-01,WOS:000421724600002,,

The main noise sources responsible for this increase were identified as ship traffic, offshore construction and oil & gas surveying. The Portuguese Navy funded SUBECO project aims at deploying a network of multiparametric offshore buoys for environmental and acoustic monitoring. A preferred location for the individual buoys is within or close by the ship traffic separation lanes along the west coast of Portugal. It is therefore expected that the received acoustic field will be dominated by shipping noise as a mixture of both short and long range ships. Most ships will have an AIS so their position may be known at all times. One of the objectives of this network is to use the recorded sound to infer and calibrate model predicted noise in a wider area. This work proposes a relatively simple technique for estimating the radiated noise level of ship tracks within acoustic reach of a single (or a small number of closely localized) hydrophone(s). It is expected that the data constrained predicted field with the estimated source levels will provide a better fit to the actual wide area acoustic field.

In 2012, with the promulgation of the Decree 1483/12, the provincial government made the first law for the exploration and exploitation of unconventional oil and gas in the country. In order to prevent, mitigate and minimize environmental impacts of hydraulic fracturing the Decree prohibits the use of underground waters for the exploration and exploitation of unconventional oil and gas. However, it provides for the use of surface water for these activities and argues that 94% of the volume of the main rivers in the region flows into the sea without being used. Through a political ecology perspective and using critical discourse analysis, the chapter intends to make sense of how the state shapes socio-natural relations and seeks to manufacture consent for hydraulic fracturing. The analysis shows that government and industry actors develop an environmental discourse centered on two main arguments: the need to exploit natural resources in order to reinforce development and the possibility of exploiting natural resources with environmental protection. This discourse thus aims to legitimize the exploitation of unconventional hydrocarbons. In particular, government and industry attempt to secure access to water for unconventional oil and gas activities by unfolding a sense of excess availability of surface water, which tend to ignore alternative ideas and usages of water.",,,,,,,,,2,0,0,0,0,0,2,,,2367-4008,2367-4016,978-3-030-18342-4; 978-3-030-18341-7,,,,,,,,,"Univ Kassel, Int Ctr Dev & Decent Work ICDD, Kassel, GermanyKarlsruhe Inst Technol KIT, Inst Reg Sci IfR, Karlsruhe, Germany",,,,2021-05-25,WOS:000637775400009,,

Results indicate that recovery on Moreton Island is taking longer than the 3-4 years suggested by the literature.

Many kuroko deposits and oil aryl gas fields are distributed in two belts along the northeast Japan arc. the kuroko metal-belt on the Pacific side and the oil-belt on the Sea of Japan side. The kuroko deposits are located mainly in the Green Tuff strata which formed as a result of submarine volcanisin during the late Miocene and Pliocene. Most of the source rocks of the oil and gas deposits formed at the same time as the kuroko deposits and some of them are located in reservoirs of hydrothermally-altered volcanic rocks in the Green Tuff region. There is general agreement that the kuroko deposits formed as a result of submarine hydrothermal and magmatic activity whereas almost all petroleum geologists and geochemists consider that hydrocarbon deposits were generated independently of such activity. Since the discovery of hydrothermally-generated petroleum in the Guaymas Basin. Gulf of California, however. it is clear that petroleum can be formed almost instantaneously in terrestrial and submarine hydrothermal areas. The paleo-northeastern Sea of Japan is therefore considered to be a potential area for hydrothermal petroleum generation because thick organic-rich sediments overlie an active submarine volcanic area. Several lines of geological and geochemical evidence suggest the possibility of hydrothermally-enhanced maturation of organic matter and the contribution of magmatic activity to the formation of these deposits. Although most of the oil and gas in northern Honshu has been generated conventionally as a consequence of the high geothermal gradients there. it appears that some of the oil and gas fields may have formed as a result of extensive hydrothermal and magmatic activity during the late Miocene to Pliocene. Because of the much steeper angle of the faults in the vicinity of the Hokuroku basin than in the Akita basin, the magmatic contribution to the kuroko mineralization would have been far greater than to the oil and gas deposits of the Niigata and Akita basins. We therefore propose a strong relationship between metal and oil and gas generation in northern Honshu based on the structure and tectonics of the northern Honshu arc-back-arc system.",,,,,Workshop on Development of Oceanic Arcs and the Formation of Kuroko DepositsWorkshop on Development of Oceanic Arcs and the Formation of Kuroko Deposits,"SEP 30, 2001SEP 30, 2001",Soc Resource Geol; Soc Mineralog; Petrolog & Econ Geol Japan; Mineralog Soc JapanSoc Resource Geol; Soc Mineralog; Petrolog & Econ Geol Japan; Mineralog Soc Japan,"Akita Univ, Akita, JAPANAkita Univ, Akita, JAPAN",8,0,0,0,0,0,8,,,1344-1698,,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Tokyo, Grad Sch Sci, Earthquake Chem Lab, Tokyo 1130033, JapanKyushu Univ, Grad Sch Social & Cultural Studies, Dept Evolut Earth Environm, Fukuoka 8108560, JapanUniv Tokyo, Earthquake Res Inst, Tokyo 1130032, Japan",,,,2004-01-01,WOS:000226212800004,,

Understanding the mechanisms underlying successful invasions is an important component of conservation and management efforts, but this has been poorly investigated in a spatially explicit manner. Knowing where and why invasion patterns change throughout the landscape enables managers to use context-specific controls on the spread of invasive species. Using high-resolution airborne imaging spectroscopy, we studied plant performance in growth within and across landscapes to examine the dominance and spatial distribution of an invasive tree, Psidium cattleianum (strawberry guava), in heterogeneous environmental conditions of a submontane Hawaiian tropical forest. We assessed invader performance using the GPP ratio index, which is the relative difference in remotely sensed estimates of gross primary productivity between canopies of guava and canopies of the invaded plant community. In addition, we used airborne LiDAR data to evaluate the impacts of guava invasion on the forest aboveground carbon density in different environments. Structural equation modeling revealed that substrate type and elevation above sea level interact and amplify landscape-scale differences in productivity between the invasive species and the host plant community (GPP ratio); differences that ultimately control levels of dominance of guava. We found shifts in patterns of forest carbon storage based on both gradual increase of invader dominance and changes in environmental conditions. Overall, our results demonstrate that the remotely sensed index defined as the GPP ratio provided an innovative spatially explicit approach to track and predict the success of invasive plants based in their canopy productivity, particularly within a landscape-scale framework of varying environmental factors such as soils and elevation. This approach may help managers accurately predict where invaders of forests, scrublands, or grasslands are likely to exhibit high levels of dominance before the environment is fully invaded.",,,,,,,,,10,0,0,0,7,0,11,,,1051-0761,1939-5582,,,,,,,,,,"Carnegie Inst Sci, Dept Global Ecol, Stanford, CA 94305 USAUS Forest Serv, Inst Pacific Isl Forestry, Pacific Southwest Res Stn, USDA, Hilo, HI 96720 USA",,,,2017-03-28,WOS:000395634300008,28135760,

The motivation to this work began with the application of semisubmersible units (SS) in the oil and gas production activity. These units are planned and installed for long term operation, typically 25 years. Throughout their operational life a SS unit usually requires modifications, basically due to the natural reservoir changes or due to safety or regulatory issues that lead to changes in lightweight. The option of demobilizing a Floating Production System (FPS) to calm waters to execute the Inclining Experiment is neither economical nor technically feasible, due to the impacts to the mooring system, risers system and reservoir management plus the associated costs to tow the unit close to coastal areas. Bearing in mind this scenario, an alternative method to carry out the test with the unit in operation offshore with wind, waves and current and under the influence of the mooring lines and risers could be applied as previously proposed.

The release of mucus is exacerbated by stressful conditions. Despite the recognized importance of cnidarian mucus to production and material flux in marine ecosystems, the role of gelatinous zooplankton in influencing the fate of oil spills is unknown. In this study we used laboratory experiments to observe the influence of mucus from the moon jellyfish (Aurelia aurita) on the aggregation and degradation of crude oil. The results show that jellyfish swimming in a dispersed solution of oil droplets produced copious amounts of mucus and the mucus aggregates that were shed by the animals contained 26 times more oil than the surrounding water. Incubation experiments showed that hydrocarbon degrading bacteria cell densities more than doubled in the presence of mucus and after 14 days, resulted in a significant increase in oil degradation. These results suggest that jellyfish can aggregate dispersed oil droplets and embed them within a matrix that favors hydrocarbon degrading bacteria. While this study lends support to the hypothesis that the presence of gelatinous zooplankton can impact oil spills large scale mesocosm studies will be needed to fully quantify the influence on a natural system.

The microbiota in these systems can potentially have great impact on the robustness and health of the fish. These two types of aquaculture systems are likely to have different challenges regarding pathogenic invasion due to the different water management, e.g. different treatment of the intake water and different turnover of the water. In this study, we investigated the bacterial microbiota of both water and biofilms in a commercial RAS and in S-CCS in sea during a three months period of post-smolt production. Deep-sequencing of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene (V4) was used for the first time to obtain in depth compositional analysis of microbial communities in commercial scale facilities. Highly diverse communities were detected, with up to 2000 different Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs) within samples. Both systems were dominated by Proteobacteria with Rhodobacteraceae as the dominating taxa, followed by Bacteroidetes that was dominated by Polaribacter among others. However, the microbiota composition was clearly different between the two aquaculture systems, and between water samples and biofilms. In RAS, it was also shown different microbiota composition with water salinity of 12 vs 22 parts per thousand (ppt). Higher abundance of e.g. Myxococcales and Nitrospiraceae was observed at 12 ppt, which coincided with lower total ammonia nitrogen (TAN) levels. Both taxa were also more abundant in the Moving Bed Bioreactor (MBBR)-biofilms than in water, as well as Planctomyces among others. In S-CCS, clear temporal changes of the microbiota was observed during the production, where potential pathogens like Tenacibaculum, Aliivibrio, Alteromonadaceae and Polaribacter were increasing in the spring time, as well as one unassigned taxa and chloroplast DNA likely from algae. The implication of these potential pathogens on fish health is unknown. A common observation for both RAS and S-CCS was higher abundance of the potential pathogens in the water compared to the biofilms. Further studies on the microbiota in closed-containment aquaculture systems are needed to obtain more knowledge about their impact on post-smolt production performance, welfare and health.

During the Devonian and Early Mississippian, such shales became abundant across much of east-central United States, apparently controlled by a unique coincidence of paleoclimatic, paleogeographic and tectonic factors. Like most major black-shale depositional episodes, Devonian-Mississippian deposits were formed during a time of global transgressive and greenhouse states. During this time, the east-central United States was located in the subtropical trade-wind belt where marine and terrestrial organic productivity would have been high and where surface waters would rarely have become cool enough to overturn and disrupt the water stratification necessary to generate bottom anoxia. Location in the trade-wind belt may also have enhanced upwelling which would have increased organic productivity and the likelihood of anoxia. Perhaps most importantly, however, black-shale deposition coincided with early phases of tectonism, when, because of rapid deformational loading in the orogen, subsidence in the adjacent Appalachian foreland basin far outstripped sedimentation. In the resulting deep-water conditions, water stratification and accompanying anoxia were soon established. Because most of the deformational load at this stage was subaqueous, there was no major source of clastic dilution, so that clastic starvation prevailed and largely organic-rich sediments accumulated. Thus hydrocarbon source beds of broad extent like the Devonian-Mississippian black shales, are rarely attributable to a single cause. They typically result from a complex interplay of factors unique to a given time and place.",,,,,EASTERN OIL SHALE SYMPEASTERN OIL SHALE SYMP,"NOV 13-15, 1991NOV 13-15, 1991",,"LEXINGTON, KYLEXINGTON, KY",32,1,0,0,6,0,47,,,0016-2361,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1992-12-01,WOS:A1992JY15700019,,

To properly assess the effects of design, fabrication, inspection and repair strategy for structures degradation due to crack growth, Fracture mechanics (FM) models need to be applied. This paper deals with the application of a probabilistic fracture mechanics approach to predict the fatigue life of welded steel structure in the presence of cracks under random spectral loading. It is based on a BS7910 [1] proposed bi-linear relationship to model fatigue crack growth and incorporates a failure criterion to describe the interaction between fracture and plastic collapse. Uncertainty modeling, especially of fatigue crack growth parameters, is undertaken with the aid of recently published data in support of the bi-linear crack growth relationship. Results pertaining to fatigue reliability and fatigue crack size evolution are presented using the Monte Carlo Simulation technique, and emphasis is placed on a comparison between linear and bi-linear crack growth models. The bi-linear crack growth model is found to lead to higher fatigue life estimates and shows sensitivity to many other parameters in addition to the state of stress of the component. This leads to implications on inspection schemes for components of the marine structures and to ensure minimization of the surprises due to wide scatter of the fatigue phenomenon in marine environment.

The development of a reliable paleoenvironmental model is critical to successful large-scale carbon dioxide (CO2) storage, but is complicated by the need to interpret prevegetation sedimentation processes. The present study presents a paleoenvironmental model of the Lower Mount Simon Sandstone, based on analysis of primary sedimentary structures in two cores and four complete high-resolution resistivity logs (FMI).The Lower Mount Simon Sandstone represents a vertical drying-up'' sequence composed of three associated depositional units: a north-south oriented coastal system at the base, an eastward-directed fluvial unit in the middle, and a westward-directed eolian system at the top that recycled medium- and fine-grained sand in the basin. Quantitative analysis of fluvial cross-strata indicates that the perennial river system was shallow (c. 1 m deep) with relatively narrow channel belts (c. 1 km). Adjacent sandy eolian-floodplain deposits contain abundant thin, crinkly planar laminae that are enriched in fines and are interpreted as cementation surfaces, likely of biological origin. Deflation lags and wind-ripple strata are commonly interbedded with the crinkly strata, suggesting that the recurrence of erosion and deposition that controlled sedimentary preservation on the floodplain were dominated by eolian transport, re-wetting, and (bio-) cementation. Such a prominent role of exposure to the wind, basin-scale sediment recycling, and eolian removal of fine-grained sediment would have ceased to exist for most climates after the development of vegetation on land, yet, may well be key to understanding the environmental context for early life on Earth.",,,,,,,,,3,0,0,0,1,0,3,,,1527-1404,1938-3681,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Illinois, Dept Geol, 1301 West Green St, Urbana, IL 61801 USAUniv Southampton, Dept Geog, Univ Rd, Southampton SO16 1BJ, Hants, EnglandUniv Illinois, Dept Geog, 1301 West Green St, Urbana, IL 61801 USAUniv Illinois, Dept GIS Mech Sci & Engn, 1301 West Green St, Urbana, IL 61801 USAUniv Illinois, Ven Te Chow Hydrosyst Lab, 1301 West Green St, Urbana, IL 61801 USAUniv Illinois, Prairie Res Inst, Illinois State Geol Survey, Nat Resources Bldg,615 East Peabody Dr, Champaign, IL 61820 USAUniv Greifswald, Inst Geog & Geol, Friedrich Ludwig Jahn Str 17a, D-17489 Greifswald, GermanyWright State Univ, Dept Earth & Environm Sci, 3640 Colonel Glenn Highway, Dayton, OH 45435 USALancing Coll, Lancing BN15 0RX, England",Lancing Coll,,,2021-02-23,WOS:000615518700005,,

Currently, there are about 20 CCS facilities worldwide, including seven large capacity facilities and 13 medium-sized ones. Despite the high investment and management costs, CCS operation is operated because it is the only technology recognized by the UNFCCC that collects and stores CO2 based on fossil energy directly. And because it is an essential technology to cope with climate change. However, discussions are under way on the potential risks of storing carbon dioxide in the ground. Some of the dangers that could arise from leaking carbon dioxide stored underground to the surface include damage to humans and plants, drinking water pollution about groundwater contamination, and the risk of seismic activity caused by large-capacity carbon dioxide underground storage. To address this anxiety, it is necessary to widely introduce and share information about the storage of CCS to address misunderstanding and anxiety.Therefore, it is deemed necessary to supplement not only the storage company but also the national management system and legal responsibility for protecting the victims so that captured and transported carbon dioxide can be safely underground in the underground rock layer. To this end, the U.S., which records its long history and experience, seeks to address public anxiety through legal supplementation of CCS, which is essential to reducing greenhouse gas emissions, by looking at the legal system of CCS facilities in Germany, which provides a legal basis in response to various risk variables.",,,,"본 연구는 온실가스 오염의 주된 원인물질인 이산화탄소를 포집, 운송하여 육지의 지중이나, 해양 수면 아래의 지중 혹은 암석층 공극에 저장하는 것에 대하여 지진 등으로부터 위험과 안전성 등에 관한 법률Â·제도 등을 연구한 것이다. 현재 전 세계적으로 실증 및 상업용으로 200여개가 운영 중에 있으며 많은 투자비용이 소요됨에도 불구하고 CCS를 운영하는 이유는 화석에너지를 기반으로 하는 CO2를 직접 포집하여 저장하는 기술이자, UNFCCC로부터 인정받은 유일한 기술이기 때문이다. 그리고 CO2를 직접 포집하여 저장할 수 있는 가장 집적적인 온실가스 저감 기술이다. 최근 이산화탄소를 지중에 저장함으로써 발생하는 잠재적 위험(Risiko)의 논의가 한창이다. 지하에 저장된 이산화탄소가 지표에 누출됨으로써 생길 수 있는 위험으로는 인간 및 식물에 대한 피해, 지하수오염으로 인한 식수 오염, 대용량의 이산화탄소 지중저장으로 저장소 지표면 스트레스 유발로 인한 지진활동 촉발위험 등이 거론되고 있다. 이러한 불안을 해소하기 위해서는 CCS의 지중 저장에 대한 정보를 국민과 함께 소통하고 공유하여 오해와 불안을 모색할 필요가 있다.따라서 이산화탄소를 지중에 안전하게 저장할 수 있도록 저장업체는 물론, 국가적 차원의 관리체계와 피해자 보호를 위한 법률적 책임이 보완되어야 할 것으로 간주된다. 이를 위해 우리나라의 CCS 운영 현황을 살펴보고, CCS 운영에 대한 오랜 역사와 경험을 보유하고 있는 미국, 다양한 위험변수에 대응하여 확고한 법률적 기반을 이루고 있는 독일의 CCS 법률적 제도 등을 연구하여, 확실한 지진 위험의 증거와 견해를 명쾌하게 제시하여 온실가스 감축에 필수적인 CCS에 관한 법률적 보완은 물론, 국민의 불안을 해소하고자 한다.",,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,,,1975-0005,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2019-06-25,KJD:ART002470041,,

Prior research has focused on evaluations of air and water quality in particular regions without explicitly considering temporal variation; thus, little is known about the potential effects of UD activity on the environment over longer periods of time. Here, we present an assessment of private well water quality in an area of increasing UD activity over a period of 13 months. We analyzed samples from 42 private water wells located in three contiguous counties on the Eastern Shelf of the Permian Basin in Texas. This area has experienced a rise in UD activity in the last few years, and we analyzed samples in four separate time points to assess variation in groundwater quality over time as UD activities increased. We monitored general water quality parameters as well as several compounds used in UD activities. We found that some constituents remained stable over time, but others experienced significant variation over the period of study. Notable findings include significant changes in total organic carbon and pH along with ephemeral detections of ethanol, bromide, and dichloromethane after the initial sampling phase. These data provide insight into the potentially transient nature of compounds associated with groundwater contamination in areas experiencing UD activity. (C) 2016 Elsevier B. V.

In this study, a mesocosm experiment simulating a petroleum spill event was performed to investigate changes in the abundance, structure, and productivity of bacterial communities in response to oil pollution. Cultured heterotrophic bacteria and total bacteria showed a consistent trend involving an immediate decrease in abundance, followed by a slight increase, and a steady low-level thereafter. However, the changing trend of bacterial productivity based on bacterial biomass and bacterial volume showed the opposite trend. In addition, the density of oil-degrading bacteria increased initially, then subsequently declined. The change in the bacterial community structure at day 0 and day 28 were also analyzed by amplified ribosomal DNA restriction analysis (ARDRA), which indicated that the species diversity of the bacterial community changed greatly after oil pollution. Alphaproteobacteria (40.98%) replaced Epsilonproteobacteria (51.10%) as the most abundant class, and Gammaproteobacteria (38.80%) became the second most dominant class in the whole bacterial community. The bacterial communities in oil-contaminated seawater (32 genera) became much more complex than those found in the natural seawater sample (16 genera). The proportion of petroleum-degrading bacteria in the oil-contaminated seawater also increased. In this study, culture-dependent and culture-independent approaches were combined to elucidate changes in both bacterial productivity and community structure.

Toward this end, we build a system dynamics model using the Norwegian Oil and Gas Industry as the context. The Norwegian Oil and Gas Industry has started to adopt new information communication technology to connect its offshore platforms, onshore control centers, and suppliers. In oil companies, the management is generally aware of the increasing risks associated with operational transition; however, to date, investment in incident response capability has not been highly prioritized because of the uncertainty related to risks and the present reactive mental model of security risk management. The model simulation shows that a reactive approach to security risk management might trap the organization into blindness to minor incidents and low incident response capability, which can lead to severe incidents. The system dynamics model can serve as a means to promote proactive investment in incident response capability. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

However, the extraction of energy from hydrates remains uncertain due to limited understanding on how hydrates are formed and dissociated under different perturbations. More than 90% of NGH resource exists within marine location where salts are present. In this study, we investigated the formation and dissociation behavior of methane hydrate in the presence of magnesium chloride (MgCl2) and potassium chloride (MCl), two salts found in seawater, at 1.5 wt% and 3.0 wt%; and compared it with the cases of water and NaCl from our previous work. We found that on top of thermodynamic inhibition, both MgCl2 and MCl act as kinetic inhibitors on hydrate formation, retarding the rate of formation - with MCl exhibiting a weaker inhibition compared to MgCl2. For hydrate dissociation via thermal stimulation, we demonstrated that hydrate dissociates more rapidly in the presence of salts as compared to water despite a comparable temperature driving force (Delta T = 5.3 K) applied. Our results indicated that the weaker thermodynamic inhibitor, MCl, has a milder kinetic inhibition effect on hydrate formation and a weaker promoting effect on hydrate dissociation as compared to MgCl2 and NaCl.

The UK contains 10-15% of the global resource of upland blanket peatlands, the hydrology and ecology of which are highly sensitive to external anthropogenic and climatic forcing. In particular, drainage of these landscapes for agricultural intensification and peat extraction has resulted in often unquantified damage to the peatland hydrology, and little is understood about the spatially distributed impacts of these practices on near-surface wetness. This paper develops new techniques to extract spatial data describing the near-surface wetness and hydrological behaviour of drained blanket peatlands using airborne thermal imaging data and airborne Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) data. The relative thermal emissivity (?(r)) of the ground surface is mapped and used as a proxy for near-surface wetness. The results show how moorland drainage and land surface structure have an impact on airborne measurements of thermal emissivity. Specifically, we show that information on land surface structure derived from LiDAR can help normalize signals in thermal emissivity data to improve description of hydrological condition across a test catchment in Exmoor, UK. An in situ field hydrological survey was used to validate these findings. We discuss how such data could be used to describe the spatially distributed nature of near-surface water resources, to optimize catchment management schemes and to deliver improved understanding of the drivers of hydrological change in analogous ecosystems.

Wave, wind, current loads have to be applied to the global strength model as a pre processing step to allow the analysis to take place. After the analysis, code checking must be performed to verify if the structure meets class or other requirements. Due to its complex nature, a large amount of engineering hours have to be spent for the pre and post processing. This is not only lengthy if performed manually or semi-automatically, but also mistake prone. General guidelines from classification societies exist, but general purpose commercial software is scarce and often still requires significant amount of engineering time to perform these tasks.This paper shows a rational approach to automate the pre and post processing of offshore structure global strength finite element analysis. Utilizing the FEMAP Application Program Interface (API), a complete automatic pre and post processing is implemented in one integrated program, Exmar Design Suite (EDS). The program will load the model from WAMIT generated wave pressure, apply internal pressure induced from motions to internal tanks, and also apply other environmental loads. After the finite element analysis, the program can execute strength code checking including yielding and buckling for the model. Both beam and stiffened plate panels can be identified using an automatic search algorithm, which is not a function available for general finite element software. The panels and beams are then checked against various common codes such as API/AISC/ABS/DNV. In addition, fatigue analysis can also be performed in either spectral or simplified approach.The benefits of automation are timesaving, accuracy and reliability. It also makes the check of whole model possible. Instead of relying more on screening or experience based structure check, engineers will have more confidence in the results by going through the whole model.",,,,,"30th International Conference on Ocean, Offshore and Arctic Engineering30th International Conference on Ocean, Offshore and Arctic Engineering","JUN 19-24, 2011JUN 19-24, 2011","ASME, Ocean Offshore & Arctic Engn DivASME, Ocean Offshore & Arctic Engn Div","Rotterdam, NETHERLANDSRotterdam, NETHERLANDS",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,978-0-7918-4434-2,,,,,,,,,"Exmar Offshore Co, Houston, TX USA",Exmar Offshore Co,,,2011-01-01,WOS:000314666500020,,

While different feature extraction methods, such as PCA, PLS and Gabor wavelet analysis, were applied to extract discriminative patterns from CSMF spectra, classifications were made via SVM to compare their respective performance of oil species recognition. Ideal correct rates of oil species recognition of 100% for the different types of oil spill samples and 92% for the closely-related source oil samples were achieved by combining Gabor wavelet with SVM, which indicated its advantages to be developed to a rapid, cost-effective, and accurate forensic oil spill identification technique.

To contribute to providing a priori knowledge about undesirable events for diagnostic algorithms in offshore naturally flowing wells, this work presents an original and valuable dataset with instances of eight types of undesirable events characterized by eight process variables. Many hours of expert work were required to validate historical instances and to produce simulated and hand-drawn instances that can be useful to distinguish normal and abnormal actual events under different operating conditions. The choices made during this dataset's preparation are described and justified, and specific benchmarks that practitioners and researchers can use together with the published dataset are defined.

The following oil spill treatments were considered: no treatment, dispersant alone, mineral fines (MF) alone, and dispersant+MF. The aim was to determine their influences on the fate of spilled CLB at sea. When dispersant alone was used, the highest dispersion effectiveness (DE) was noted, and DE ranged from 45% to 59% under the selected environmental conditions. With no treatment and treatment of MF alone, CLB DE was insufficient under tested conditions. Total petroleum hydrocarbon (TPH) concentration in the water column was highest for the dispersant alone, followed by that of dispersant+MF. TPH concentration for the dispersant alone increased abruptly with time. Droplet size distribution (DSD) resulting from dispersant alone had a unimodal shape, which was different than previously observed when conventional oils were treated with the dispersant. Cases of dispersant+MF were thus characterized by a broader DSD compared with dispersant only and a gradual increase in TPH concentration.

The focus has traditionally been on the planning phase, but during the last years a need for better risk analysis methods for the operational phase has been identified. Such methods should take human and organizational factors into consideration in a more explicit way than the traditional risk analysis methods do. Recently, a framework, called hybrid causal logic (HCL), has been developed based on traditional risk analysis tools combined with Bayesian belief networks (BBNs), using the aviation industry as a case. This paper reviews this framework and discusses its applicability for the offshore industry, and the relationship to existing research projects, such as the barrier and operational risk analysis project (BORA). The paper also addresses specific features of the framework and suggests a new approach for the probability assignment process. This approach simplifies the assignment process considerably without loosing the flexibility that is needed to properly reflect the phenomena being studied. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

The role of the terrestrial biosphere as a source or sink for carbon during climate change is critical: if increased GHG concentration and warming enhances carbon storage, thereby reducing atmospheric concentrations, the climate changes would also be ameliorated. If instead, carbon storage is reduced, the warming could induce a positive feedback to further increase atmospheric concentrations already on the rise from burning of fossil fuels. Differing climate-defined static vegetation classifications have been used to project biome distributions for climates induced by 2XGHGs. These projections assume that species extirpation and invasion will track perfectly distributions of climate variables and they predict enhanced terrestrial carbon storage. However, theoretical calculations and palaeoecological evidence suggest an alternative, more realistic simplifying assumption: trees will be extirpated but will not invade new territory before 2XGHG climate is attained.

The purpose of this IEA GHG study([1]) was to identify typical substances that could be mobilised during geosequestration and to evaluate potential tools for monitoring these substances. This project reviewed the scientific literature patent applications and industry publications relevant to the current monitoring of chemical and physical processes due to CO2-formation water-rock interactions from the deep subsurface through to the soil/water interface. Four major areas were identified for review: 1-physical effects, including pressure effects or displacement of fluids; 2 - geochemical effects, including dissolution of reservoir and seal rocks, as well as the potential for mobilisation of heavy metals; 3 - shallow/surface effects, potential nutrients/toxic compounds affecting soils and microbial communities, as well as groundwater quality; 4 - capture contaminant effects from coal fired plants and other point source emitters. The various processes have different degrees of impact in the three general monitoring domains: a) injection horizon (depleted hydrocarbon reservoir, saline formation), b) above-zone interval (zone directly overlying the seal of the storage interval), and c) shallow subsurface (potable groundwater aquifers, soil). Understanding these processes and mapping their distribution aids in the identification of potential monitoring tools and facilitates an assessment of their utility in a particular monitoring domain.Some tools already commonly deployed in other industries are highly applicable to the carbon storage industry; for example, downhole pressure gauges from the oil industry and water level loggers from the groundwater industry. In general, geophysical tools were found to be quite a mature method for identifying the presence of gas (hydrocarbons or CO2), but less so for observing mobilised substances and changes in salinity. Tools for measuring trace amounts of hydrocarbons in marine settings are able to be modified in order to be used for monitoring mobilised hydrocarbons entrained in capture emissions, from CO2/source rock interactions or ienhanced oil recovery processes, though many of the tools are not compound specific as yet. The aim of the project is to provide an understanding of the availability of conventional and novel tools for monitoring and verification (M&V) during CO2 injection. Some of these tools have been successfully employed in current carbon capture and storage (CCS) projects or in alternative applications, such as mineral exploration and ecological studies.

In October 2015, a resource consent hearing was concluded, and this sought approval to abandon the remaining sections of the Rena wreck on Otaiti. Maori submissions to the hearing process were divided between opposition to the applicant's request and support from others, including the Te Arawa ki Tai tribal grouping. Te Arawa ki Tai have adapted the Mauri Model Decision Making Framework to provide a better understanding of the recovery process, and the holistic understanding it provides is of relevance to other international contexts. This paper shares how the Mauri Model Decision Making Framework, in conjunction with an indigenous based methodology, empowered Te Arawa ki Tai in the recovery process and facilitated an enhanced Te Arawa ki Tai understanding. Since the grounding, Te Arawa ki Tai have co-created indicator sets that are inclusive of all of the relevant scientific and indigenous knowledge available.

The 3DSA consists of 15 hydrophones mounted on cubic frame of about 1 m in size.Various field tests and commercial projects have been conducted using autonomous vehicles as platforms, each towing a 3DSA. Often, these have been deployed during ongoing traditional seismic surveys, thus allowing the possibility of making direct comparisons of operations flexibility and data.The objectives of this project were toAssess the feasibility of seismic acquisition using AVs and 3DSA, including safe deployment and retrievalEvaluate the performance of the 3DSA based on holding station capability, maintenance of desired depth, and accuracy of measurements of pitch and orientationCompare the quality of the acquired seismic data with the pressure data recorded in the traditional surveysMarine seismic data are normally acquired using towed-streamer arrays, ocean-bottom cables (OBC), or ocean-bottom nodes (OBN) where the receivers are in fixed positions on the seafloor. Towed streamer-acquisition is the predominant method of marine acquisition because it is highly efficient and easy to implement. Narrow-azimuth (NAZ) streamer acquisition geometries typically acquire good-quality seismic data in noncomplex geologic environments and have a very well-established processing methodology. However, water depth, seafloor topography, or operational constraints due to in-situ infrastructure and obstructions can make acquiring data using these methods difficult and could result in a decrease in operational efficiency, which would increase acquisition cost or result in poor or zero data coverage.For seismic applications, the 3DSA consists of 15 hydrophones (3 in each of the five arms) mounted on a frame approximately 1.5 m in size. A buoyancy engine just below the top arm ensures that this arm remains on the high side and that the entire array is oriented and does not rotate on its axis while moving through the water. The 3D sensor array continuously records seismic data as well as array orientation and depth data.Autonomous marine vehicles provide several unique capabilities for acquiring data in marine environments. Their low cost compared to conventional vessels allows deploying them in tandem over defined areas to yield comparable results and complete coverage. In the last few years, the oil and gas industry has seen the use of AMVs grow from a level of infancy to full maturity and become an essential part of the offshore exploration and production toolbox. The vehicles are rapidly evolving in response to the needs of the industry, particularly in challenging environments, frontier areas, extremely shallow waters and prospecting close to obstructions.Projects in Abu Dhabi and the US Gulf of Mexico demonstrated the successful and safe deployment, seismic data acquisition, and retrieval of the AVs and 3DSA. The evaluation criteria indicated the consistent performance of the 3DSA and that the AMV-acquired data are comparable to conventionally acquired data in signal-to-noise ratio and frequency bandwidth.",,,,,Conference on OCEANSConference on OCEANS,"SEP 18-21, 2017SEP 18-21, 2017",,"Anchorage, AKAnchorage, AK",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,0197-7385,,*****************,,,,,,,,,"Schlumberger, Robot Serv, Houston, TX 77054 USA",,,,2017-01-01,WOS:000455012000325,,

However, when installed a relief well, the capacity was increased to 681 kton which is about 45% larger than the case without a relief well.

A comprehensive PESTLE (Political, Economic, Social, Technological, Legal and Environmental) analysis has been carried out to reveal the risks and uncertainties that face wave and tidal energy technology within identified themes. The purpose of the PESTLE analysis was to ascertain the factors most relevant to the reduction of the Levelised Cost of Energy (LCOE), and the wider commercialisation of wave and tidal energy technology. It has been shown that two separate case studies are required in order to more accurately assess the needs of the ocean energy sector.

By tracking the dynamic free surface evolution in the moonpool, it was observed that complex water motions consisting of vertical piston motions, longitudinal sloshing motions, wave run-up and impacts are coupled in the moonpool. The relative water motion amplitudes were quantified. It was identified that multiple water motions coexist even when there is only one external excitation source provided by a regular wave train. It was further demonstrated that the encountered waves travelling along the vessel have significant effects on the excitation of the resonant water motions in the moonpool.

The Caernarvon study sites had wetland surface elevation change rates ranging from 0.16 +/- 0.31 to 0.42 +/- 0.21 cm y(-1). Vertical accretion ranged from 0.75 +/- 0.04 to 1.57 +/- 0.05 cm y(-1), and shallow subsidence ranged from 0.59 to 1.21 cm y(-1). Wetland surface elevation at the WPH study sites initially increased 2.3 to 3.3 cm during the first seven months of the study and then steadily decreased over the following year. The overall rate of elevation change ranged from 0.27 +/- 0.09 to 0.70 +/- 0.11 cm y(-1). Vertical accretion and shallow subsidence ranged from 1.24 +/- 0.08 to 1.84 +/- 0.07 cm y(-1) and 0.54 to 1.27 cm y(-1), respectively. The Violet sites lost elevation and had the highest subsidence rates in this study, most likely due to a combination of hydrologic alteration and low diversion discharge. Wetland elevation decreased throughout the study, with rates ranging from -1.10 +/- 0.24 to -2.34 +/- 0.41 cm y(-1). Vertical accretion and shallow subsidence rates at the Violet-Near and Far sites were 0.449 +/- 0.10 and 0.44 +/- 0.11 cm y(-1) and 2.78 to 1.54 cm y(-1), respectively. The Violet-Mid site wetland was burned in Winter 1999, leading to more than 4.0 cm decrease in material measured over the marker horizon and contributing to the lowest accretion rate measured in this study of 0.34 +/- 0.05 cm y(-1). Analysis of regional relative sea-level rise (RSLR) indicates that all Caernarvon sites and the WPH-Near and Mid sites are keeping pace with RSLR. This study indicates that the use of river diversions can be an effective coastal restoration tool, with efficiency related to the proximity to riverine source and degree of hydrologic alteration, quantity of river water released, and land uses of the receiving wetland basin. Landscape modifications such as spoil banks associated with oil and gas access canals negate the benefits of river water introduction by limiting wetland-water interaction and should be removed in conjunction with river diversion implementation for effective wetland restoration.",,,,,,,,,71,3,0,0,50,0,88,,,0277-5212,1943-6246,,,,,,,,,,"Louisiana State Univ, Sch Coast & Environm, Dept Oceanog & Coastal Sci, Baton Rouge, LA 70803 USA",,,,2006-12-01,WOS:000243370000021,,

The aim of this paper is to present a comprehensive literature review and classification framework for academic research and industrial practices related to life extension of safety critical systems and installations. To achieve this, a systematic review is performed on the current state-of-the-art and new developments in the field of asset life extension in various industries. Major sources from which the literature can be gathered are identified and some assessment criteria are defined to categorize the selected publications. A classification framework is then proposed to support life extension decision making process with respect to the-type of asset and industry sectors where the concept of life extension has been of interest, condition assessment techniques used for qualification of assets for life extension, life prediction models, life extension strategies, etc. The current key issues in relation to the subject are outlined and the strengths and weaknesses of existing life extension decision-making tools are highlighted. This review contains an exhaustive list of scientific references on the topic, including articles published in journals, industry magazines, books and conference proceedings, university dissertations, technical reports and government documents. The proposed literature classification and analysis can help asset owners, asset managers, service providers, stakeholders, public policy-makers, environment protection authorities, and regulatory bodies gain valuable insights on asset life extension decision making procedures and methodologies.

Loss of saline wetlands due to relative sea-level rise, land-use change, and hydrologic alterations liberates previously stored C and reduces the capacity for future C sequestration. Widespread wetland loss has prompted marsh restoration and creation projects around the world; however, little is known about the timescale and capacity for created marshes to function as blue C sinks and the role of environmental conditions in mediating soil C accumulation in restoration sites. Using a chronosequence of five created saline marshes ranging in age from 5 to 32 yr and two adjacent natural reference marshes in southwest Louisiana, USA, short- and longer-term C accumulation rates (SCAR and LCAR, respectively) were determined using feldspar marker horizons and peat depth in cores at six locations in each marsh. Created marshes ranged in elevation from -12 to 41 cm (NAVD88) and supported assorted plant community compositions driven by local environmental conditions. SCAR ranged from 75 to 430 g C center dot m(-2)center dot yr(-1), which were comparable in the two youngest and two oldest marshes. Longer-term CAR ranged from 18 to 99 g C center dot m(-2)center dot yr(-1) but did not significantly differ among marshes of different ages. Our findings indicate that LCAR in these created marshes were influenced by site-specific environmental conditions (i.e., stem density and mineral sediment) rather than marsh age. Results suggest that conditions appropriate for the establishment of vegetation with high stem densities, such as Distichlis spicata and Spartina patens, may facilitate higher LCAR in created marshes, which may be useful for restoration project planning and mitigation of climate change.",,,,,,,,,23,1,0,0,14,0,27,,,2150-8925,,,,,,,,,,,"Louisiana State Univ, Coll Coast & Environm, Dept Oceanog & Coastal Sci, Baton Rouge, LA 70803 USAUniv Massachusetts, Dept Environm Conservat, Amherst, MA 01003 USA",,,,2019-08-01,WOS:000483832300033,,

However, tree height measurement is time consuming, and the recommended procedure is to use estimates from tree height (H) - diameter at breast height (DBH) models. Increasingly, H-DBH models are being developed for urban forests, providing tools to forest management and ecosystem services estimation. Here, we compared model forms and approaches for predicting H as a function of DBH and additional stand level covariates variables. Four model forms were evaluated: (i) basic models (which only used DBH as predictor variable); (ii) generalized models (which used DBH and other predictor variables based on the best basic model); (iii) a mixed-effects model based on the best basic model; and (iv) a mixed-effects model based on the generalized model. Several sampling designs aimed at minimizing height measurement were tested in terms of accuracy and applicability. Taking predicted accuracy and investigation cost into account, we recommend generalized non-linear mixed-effects model (NLME) when there were two or less tree height measurements taken in a given stand.

The applicable steel grades must show an optimum trade-off between sufficient toughness and good strength properties, and at the same time allow easy fabrication, especially concerning weldability. Although sufficient toughness is of importance in order to avoid abrupt failure phenomena such as brittle fracture, good strength properties are necessary to minimize the dead weight of the structure and thus facilitate transport and erection process. The significance of good fabrication properties consist of two facets: good weldability results in easy processing procedures and thus cost-efficiency in fabrication; further, materials with good weldability exhibit a higher resistance to cracking phenomena in the heat affected zone and are therefore more forgiving when it comes to non-optimum welding conditions, which may occur during erection in harsh environments. This steel has to be tailor-made at the steelworks, the aim being to produce it as cleanly as possible with specially adapted alloying concepts. To secure good properties in the half thickness portion of the plates, what is necessary for offshore plates, slabs and ingots have to show an accurate control of the mid thickness segregation. Additionally those plates need higher deformation ratios from slab to plate in order to get a dense structure also in the mid thickness by proper through thickness deformation. These materials are produced with various rolling and heat treatment processes, each chosen depending on the desired grade, thickness and weight of the final plate. The processes in use are normalization of the plates, thermomechanical controlled rolling and the quenching and tempering of the plates.

We show that idealized enhanced weathering scenarios over less than a third of tropical land could cause significant drawdown of atmospheric CO2 and ameliorate ocean acidification by 2100. Global carbon cycle modelling(6-8) driven by ensemble Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) projections of twenty-first-century climate change (RCP8.5, business-as-usual; RCP4.5, medium-level mitigation)(9,10) indicates that enhanced weathering could lower atmospheric CO2 by 30-300 ppm by 2100, depending mainly on silicate rock application rate (1 kg or 5 kg m(-2) yr(-1)) and composition. At the higher application rate, end-of-century ocean acidification is reversed under RCP4.5 and reduced by about two-thirds under RCP8.5. Additionally, surface ocean aragonite saturation state, a key control on coral calcification rates, is maintained above 3.5 throughout the low latitudes, thereby helping maintain the viability of tropical coral reef ecosystems(11-14).

Membrane filtration is a promising technology to improve separation, but fouling of the membranes causes a significant reduction in flow capacity. To reduce fouling, optimization of the backwashing parameters is given much attention. Comprehensive and time-consuming experiments are used to model the effect of backwashing, but most methods neglect time varying features present in the offshore produced water treatment train. In this paper, a backwashing scheduling algorithm is proposed, which dynamically selects the filtration and backwashing durations to maximize the average net permeate production. The proposed algorithm is tested on a lab-scaled pilot plant, where it was able to adapt as irreversible fouling accumulated and the OiW concentration changed. The paper concludes that the removal rate of oil fouling was observed to be dependent on the rate at which the backwashing pressure could be established.

Both of these threats can be ameliorated by the development of hydrogen and particularly hydrogen made from coal as a major energy carrier to replace oil products such as gasoline and diesel fuel to power our motor vehicles with electricity made by gasifying coal (rather than burning coal) with carbon capture and storage/sequestration (CCS). Most discussions of climate change emphasize extreme weather events, rising temperatures and rising sea levels. While these aspects of climate change may be very disruptive, the real catastrophic impact of climate change may be our inability to provide enough food for a growing world population due to the confluence of higher temperatures that reduce food production, coupled with increased global consumption of meat that requires more crop production than eating fruits, vegetables and grains as people aspire to the living standards in developed nations, and the production of biofuels from crops (Biofuels can also be produced from waste products such as municipal solid waste (MSW) without impacting crop production.) that limits farm land available for food production. Powering our light duty vehicles with hydrogen made from coal, and our electricity from a combination of nuclear energy, renewables and natural gas and coal gasification with carbon capture and storage/sequestration (In Carbon capture and sequestration, the carbon in the form of carbon dioxide (CO2) is recovered at the power plant, compressed, and shipped by pipeline to an underground storage cavern where it is buried underground, thereby preventing the CO2 from entering the atmosphere where it would have exacerbated the impact of climate change.) (CCS) would drastically reduce or even eliminate our dependence on foreign oil, (The U.S. petroleum production is sufficient to supply all non-transportation oil requirements.) and, if the rest of the world follows our lead, could eliminate the influence of OPEC and our dependence oil imported from the volatile Middle East, and this approach would allow us to meet the climate change goal of reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions to 80 % below 1990 levels by 2050 while relying primarily on our huge inventory of domestic coal to supply both hydrogen and electricity. Many advocates of using hydrogen as a zero-emission energy carrier envision a future where hydrogen is produced by electrolyzing water using renewable energy. While this vision of a renewable hydrogen economy may be a long-term goal for society, it might be too costly or take too long to make the transition from our current predominantly coal-and natural gas-based electricity generation system and our nearly total dependence on oil products for transportation to an all-renewable future in the next few decades. This book therefore explores a more plausible transition strategy using coal, natural gas, renewable and nuclear power as the primary sources of energy over the next few decades as a practical pathway toward a renewable hydrogen future. Making hydrogen from renewables by electrolyzing water also raises the issue of water resources. It may be necessary to develop technologies to electrolyze sea water to make renewable hydrogen a sustainable long-term option with respect to water utilization. In the near term, hydrogen made from coal offers an alternative less dependent on our planet's limited freshwater resources.While this book is focused primarily on reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from electricity power plants, we also explore the option of jump-starting a near zero-emission hydrogen-powered fuel cell electric vehicle (FCEV) transportation system by installing Tri-Generation fueling stations at warehouses, distribution centers and big box stores. These Tri-Gen stations generate three energy carriers made from natural gas: hydrogen, electricity and heat; Chap. 7 demonstrates that such distributed Tri-Gen stations would provide a significant return on investment in Hawaii, California and the Eastern portion of the United States by displacing expensive electricity at the stores, thereby allowing the profitable introduction of hydrogen fueling stations to ramp up the introduction of zero emission FCEVs in the nation's vehicle fleet. We show that these Tri-Gen stations could be profitable today by providing hydrogen at many warehouses that have already converted from battery-operated fork lift trucks to fuel cell lift trucks powered by hydrogen.",,,,,,,,,2,0,0,0,1,0,2,,,2195-1284,,978-3-319-31655-0; 978-3-319-31654-3,,,,,,,,,"H2Gen Innovat Inc, Alexandria, VA 22304 USA",H2Gen Innovat Inc,,,2017-01-01,WOS:000419731300002,,

Attempts to reclaim mangrove swamps for rice growing have shown the importance of a greater knowledge on the effects of land use change on soil properties and soil carbon storage. To address this problem, a study was undertaken within Cacheur and Oio regions in Northern Guinea-Bissau, along the following chronosequence: mangrove, rice and abandoned fields. Changes in C/N ratio, delta C-13 and delta N-15 values were used to study the dynamics of C-3 plant-derived and marine-derived carbon (C) in order to analyze the origin of soil organic matter (SOM) and estimate the impact of marine contribution to SOC. Isotopic signatures within the mangrove swamp rice soils suggested the inwelling of marine derived C. SOC stock was estimated in 0-10, 0-20, 0-40 and 0-80 cm soil layers using fixed soil depth (FD) and fixed soil mass (FM) approaches. The significantly highest values were found in mangrove soils and the lowest in the abandoned fields for both sites, while no significant differences were recorded for the topsoil (0-10 cm) between mangrove and rice fields. The results of this study revealed that conversion of mangrove to rice cropping has technical potential of SOC sequestration in the upper part of the soil (0-40 cm). On the other hand, the abandonment of the fields caused decreases in carbon storage along the whole soil depth. These findings may have important implications for national forest carbon monitoring systems and regional level reducing emission from deforestation and forest degradation (REDD+) strategies.

Given their position at the land-sea margin, tidal marshes are threatened by rising seas, changing climatic conditions, and human pressures, which may release previously stored carbon and reduce their ability to store carbon in the future. The resulting impacts on the carbon cycle will depend on how changes in marsh hydrology affect the movement and chemical form of carbon, but these impacts are currently unknown. This study explores the impacts of changing hydrologic conditions on marsh water chemistry and links these to changes in carbon movement between tidal marshes and the coastal ocean. The research improves predictions of how carbon budgets may change in the future and enables managers to better protect the carbon storage potential of these fragile coastal ecosystems. The project also enhances education opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students, and enables the development of the St. Jones National Estuarine Research Reserve for course instruction and public outreach. Estuaries and marshes are globally important reservoirs of carbon and the critical points of interaction between land and oceans where carbon and nutrients are cycled. Despite their importance, the hydrological controls on biogeochemistry and, in turn, carbon dynamics of these ecosystems are relatively understudied, limiting the capacity to predict feedbacks with climate change and sea-level rise, to value marsh ecosystem services, and to manage human activities in these fragile landscapes. This project incorporates field, laboratory, and modeling approaches to elucidate how carbon dynamics in coastal marshes are driven by the spatially and temporally complex hydrology through interactions between physical and biogeochemical factors. This research (1) delineates the marsh based on hydrology, subsurface geochemistry, and biological activity, (2) establishes mechanistic linkages between changes in biological, geochemical, and hydrologic factors, and (3) combines mechanistic information with hydrological modeling to gain insights into longer timescale impacts of hydrologic change on redox zonations and associated carbon dynamics. Field analyses are conducted in a mid-Atlantic tidal marsh at the St. Jones National Estuarine Research Reserve in Dover, Delaware. This work fills gaps in the understanding of the hydrologic impacts on marsh biogeochemistry and identifies specific factors controlling carbon dynamics and fluxes between marshes and the coastal ocean. This integrated study promotes development of new conceptual and quantitative models to predict feedbacks between biogeochemistry and hydrologic change in coastal systems.

The basin originated in the Triassic and Early Jurassic as continental blocks separated from North Africa and Arabia, forming a zone of extension. Clastics, carbonates, and evaporites were deposited in an extensional sag basin and in grabens. Triassic carbonate reservoirs, sealed by evaporites, are oil and gas productive in Syria and Iraq. Jurassic paralic and shaly beds and basinal limestones, deposited in the widening basin and in grabens, are oil sources in Egypt and Israel. From the Middle Jurassic to the Late Cretaceous and the extensional basin became a passive margin on which clastics alternated cyclically with carbonate platforms. This sequence provided sandstone and carbonate reservoirs sealed by shale and marl. Late Cretaceous convergence along the Taurus-Zagros front, and compression and shear in the platform and basin area coincided with regional high sea level. Organic-rich chalk, marl, shale, and limestone were deposited from the Late Cretaceous into the early Tertiary over most of the basin area. The greater part of known reserves in the region is derived from these beds, which generated oil into multiple faulted reservoirs in deep grabens and downwarps from Egypt to Syria, and into Upper Cretaceous to Paleocene reef limestones in Syria, Iraq, and Turkey.",,,,,,,,,61,0,0,0,2,0,65,,,0149-1423,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1991-07-01,WOS:A1991FV28300006,,

Driftcretions facilitate the formation of complex, diverse morphologies that increase biological productivity and organic carbon capture and buffer against erosion. Driftcretions should be common on shorelines receiving a large wood supply and with processes which store wood permanently.

Of the 6.3 billion tonnes of fossil fuel-derived plastic (FFP) waste produced to date, only 9% has been recycled; the rest being incinerated (12%) or dumped into the environment (79%). FFPs take centuries to degrade, meaning five billion tonnes of increasingly fragmented and dangerous plastics have accumulated in our oceans, soil and air. Rates of FFP production and waste are growing rapidly, driven by increased demand and shifting strategies of oil and gas companies responding to slowing profit growth. Without effective recycling, the harm caused by FFP waste will keep increasing, jeopardizing first marine life and ultimately humankind. In this Perspective article, we review the global costs of plastic pollution and explain why solving this is imperative for humanity's well-being. We show that FFP pollution is far beyond a marine environmental issue: it now invades our bodies, causing disease and dysfunction, while millions of adults and children work in conditions akin to slavery, picking through our waste. We argue that an integrated economic and technical solution, catalyzed through a voluntary industry-led contribution from new FFP production, is central to arrest plastic waste flows by making used plastic a cashable commodity, incentivizing recovery and accelerating industrialization of polymer-to-polymer technologies. Without much-needed systematic transformation, driven by a contribution from FFP production, humanity and the oceans face a troubling future.",,,,,,,,,56,0,0,0,21,0,62,,,,2296-7745,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Western Australia, Sch Biol Sci, Perth, WA, AustraliaMinderoo Fdn, Perth, WA, AustraliaUniv Western Australia, UWA Oceans Inst, Perth, WA, AustraliaNewcastle Univ, Sch Nat Arid Environm Sci, Newcastle Upon Tyne, Tyne & Wear, England",Minderoo Fdn,,,2019-10-11,WOS:000488121800001,,

The oil spill can be regarded as a release of a liquid petroleum hydrocarbon into a marine environment that is primarily caused by human activities and, resulting as a form of water pollution. Due to high customers' needs and demands around the globe, shipping activities is increasing and leads to a growing risk of marine pollution. In the shipping industry, the oil spills occurred from various sources such as release of crude oil from tanker, drilling rigs and wells; as well as spills of refined petroleum products into the sea. Millions of dollars need to be spent in recovery and it takes several months or even years to recover and clean up the affected waters. Failure in taking appropriate actions after the occurrence of the oil pollution leads to serious damage to the environment and human health. This research focuses on eight management approach towards the successful factors of oil spill preparedness and response which are; incident management systems, emergency plan, situational awareness, preparedness program, assignment of responsible staff, compliance of maritime law, response framework and regular inspection of the equipment and facilities. A questionnaire survey was used and distributed to two different companies in Lumut, Perak. In this research, 53 respondents have participated which comprises of 30 respondents from a government agency and 23 respondents from an oil & gas company.

An adsorption purification model was established and validated based on the experimental data. In quiescent adsorption, the contact area between 13X zeolite and the gas mixture is the most important factor for evaluating the adsorption purification efficiency, and higher voidages in the range of 0.25-0.50 were favorable for gas adsorption. However, in addition to the contact area, the contact time is an important factor for flowing adsorption. The purification efficiency of flowing adsorption is highest at a voidage of 0.35. At this voidage, the pressure drop in the adsorber was 70 Pa. The stabilization time for adsorption equilibrium decreased with increasing inlet velocity. As the adsorption time increased, the adsorption heat at different axial lengths of the adsorber tended to reach a constant value, while a symmetric adsorption heat curve was observed at different radial lengths. Toward the reduction of the energy consumption in the adsorption process, the optimum adsorber lengths for different diameters, temperatures, and pressures were determined. Adsorption purification was enhanced with increasing temperature. Further, it could also be improved by an appropriate pressure. Optimization of the adsorber structure parameters and regulation of the state parameters during the adsorption process are important for reducing energy consumption and improving the purification efficiency. The findings of this study serve as a guide for setting the purification parameters for CO2 separation from offshore natural gas in engineering applications.",,,,,,,,,16,0,0,0,2,0,16,,,0306-2619,1872-9118,,,,,,,,,,"China Univ Petr East China, Coll Pipeline & Civil Engn, Qingdao 266580, Peoples R ChinaRMIT Univ, Sch Engn, POB 71, Bundoora, Vic 3083, Australia",,,,2017-11-23,WOS:000414817100113,,

Marine phytoplankton play a key role in aggregate formation through the production of extracellular polymeric materials (EPS), an important step in the biological carbon pump. This study examined the impacts of oil and dispersants on the composition and physiology of natural marine phytoplankton communities from the Gulf of Mexico during a 72-hour mesocosm experiment and consequences to carbon export. The communities were treated using the water accommodated fraction (WAF) of oil, which was produced by adding Macondo surrogate oil to natural seawater and mixed for 24 h in the dark. A chemically enhanced WAF (CEWAF) was made in a similar manner, but using a mixture of oil and the dispersant Corexit in a 20:1 ratio as well as a diluted CEWAF (DCEWAF). Phytoplankton communities exposed to WAF showed no significant changes in PSII quantum yield ((Fv)/F-m) or electron transfer rates (ETRmax) compared to Control communities. In contrast, both F-v/F-m and ETRmax declined rapidly in communities treated with either CEWAF or DCEWAF. Analysis of other photophysiological parameters showed that photosystem II (PSII) antenna size and PSII connectivity factor were not altered by exposure to DCEWAF, suggesting that processes downstream of PSII were affected. The eukaryote community composition in each experimental tank was characterized at the end of the 72 h exposure time using 18S rRNA sequencing. Diatoms dominated the communities in both the control and WAF treatments (52 and 56% relative abundance respectively), while in CEWAF and DCEWAF treatments were dominated by heterotrophic Euglenozoa (51 and 84% respectively). Diatoms made up the largest relative contribution to the autotrophic eukaryote community in all treatments. EPS concentration was four times higher in CEWAF tanks compared to other treatments. Changes in particle size distributions (a proxy for aggregates) over time indicated that a higher degree of particle aggregation occurred in both the CEWAF and DCEWAF treatments than the WAF or Controls. Our results demonstrate that chemically dispersed oil has more negative impacts on photophysiology, phytoplankton community structure and aggregation dynamics than oil alone, with potential implications for export processes that affect the distribution and turnover of carbon and oil in the water column.",,,,,,,,,24,0,0,0,20,0,24,,,0166-445X,1879-1514,,,,,,,,,,"Texas A&M Univ, Dept Marine Biol, Galveston, TX 77553 USAMt Allison Univ, Environm Sci Dept, Sackville, NB, CanadaTexas A&M Univ, Dept Marine Sci, Galveston, TX 77553 USAUniv Calif Santa Barbara, Inst Marine Sci, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USAMt Allison Univ, Math & Comp Sci Dept, Sackville, NB, CanadaTexas A&M Univ, Dept Oceanog, College Stn, TX 77843 USA",,,,2019-02-15,WOS:000457506000005,30448744,

The turbine did not prevent transit of the animals through the channel and therefore did not result in a barrier' effect.However, the animals' behaviour did change when the turbine was operating, demonstrating the importance of allowing for behavioural responses when estimating collision risks associated with tidal turbines.Tagged animals passed the location of the device more frequently during slack water than when the current was running. In 2010 the frequency of transits by tagged seals reduced by 20% (95% CI: 10-50%) when the turbine was on, relative to when it was off. This effect was stronger when considering daylight hours only with a reduction of transit rate of 57% (95% CI: 25-64%). Seals tagged during the operational period transited approximately 250m either side of the turbine suggesting some degree of local avoidance compared with the pre-installation results.The results presented here have implications for monitoring and managing the potential interactions between tidal turbines and marine wildlife. Principally that the design of telemetry studies for measuring change in response to developments should seek to understand and take into account variability in seal behaviour.This study only looked at the effects of a single turbine rather than an array, and mitigation limited the ability to determine close range interactions.
