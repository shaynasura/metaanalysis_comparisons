The results show that in the past 40 years, sea level and surface temperature in the CCS have increased significantly, with the rate of 3.3 mm/ year and 0.016 degrees C/ year, respectively, higher than the global average and the historical mean in the CCS. The record-breaking SST along the coastal China in 2017 was the highest observation since 1960. The frequency of disasters caused by super-typhoons, storm surges and red tides has increased significantly since 2000. Under the influence of changes in the key marine environmental hazards and extreme events such as super typhoons and storm surges, the exposure of the coastal China areas has amplified greatly. With the improvement of marine disaster prevention and reduction measures in the coastal China area, the economic loss of marine disasters has been decreasing in the past 30 years. However, it is worth pointing out that the annual total economic loss of various marine disasters is still as much as 10 billion RMB (about 12 billion RMB of direct economic loss per year), of which the total economic loss reached the largest in 2005, about 33.2 billion RMB. This is closely related to the intensity of the disasters and the superposition and amplification effect of multiple disasters. Based on the risk of climate-related impacts from the interaction of climate-related hazard with the exposure and vulnerability of coastal human and natural systems in coastal areas, this paper further analyzes the characteristics of marine disaster risks in the coastal China areas under the background of climate change. And some scientific issues concerning marine disaster monitoring, prediction, early warning and capacity building of marine risk governance are discussed in order to provide scientific reference for the sustainable development of economy and society in the coastal China areas.",,,,,,,,,4,13,0,0,1,0,17,,,1000-9620,1000-9620,,,,,,,,,,"Minist Nat Resources, Inst Oceanog 3, Marine Environm Management and Sustainable Dev Res, Xiamen 361005, Fujian, Peoples R China",,,,2019-11-21,BCI:BCI201900981608,,

For example, reforestation can ameliorate climate-associated impacts of altered hydrological cycles in watersheds, protect coastal areas from increased storms, and provide habitat to reduce the probability of species' extinctions under a changing climate. Consequently, reforestation should be managed with both adaptation and mitigation objectives in mind, so as to maximize synergies among these diverse roles, and to avoid trade-offs in which the achievement of one goal is detrimental to another. Management of increased forest cover must also incorporate measures for reducing the direct and indirect impacts of changing climate on reforestation itself.

The thrusting force behind the coastal hydrodynamics comes majorly from tides and their interaction with diverse coastal boundaries and it also depends on the seabed profile. The seabed profile and composition give rise to a surface roughness profile which creates a drag force on the flow and modifies the velocity field [1]. These complex characteristics are simplified to a certain level by dividing the tides effect into certain harmonic tidal constants which occurs as a combination of amplitude and phase. Alderney Race (between the islands of Alderney and the cape of La Hague, France) is one of such vital locations where tidal energy can be extracted at a large scale. In our study, the ocean boundaries are mainly forced by 8 tidal constants (K1, K2, M2, N2, O1, P1, Q1, S2) that provide motion to ocean water. These tidal constants are predicted from the LeProvost Tidal Database which is a set of. legi files and was defined for the entire globe. Also, a quadratically varying friction coefficient function was employed to compensate for the seabed surface roughness. A finite element based 2-dimensional modeling (Advance circulation-ADCIRC) was conducted to estimate the tidal energy density in the region of Alderney Race. This model was validated with the field data collected at certain locations in Singapore and this formed a base for the validity of this model. The estimation of the average power density (APD) is derived from the velocity field, knowing APD to be proportional to the cube of the velocity value. The velocity field and tidal elevation calculated by the model are within the suitable limits as compared with the field data. This paper introduces a unique way of forecasting tidal energy power density using the open source software models and data sources with a maximum level of resolution. The data helps to site the higher tidal energy sites in a remote ocean location and thereby helps to minimize the deployment costs.",,,,,"Asian Conference on Energy, Power and Transportation Electrification (ACEPT)Asian Conference on Energy, Power and Transportation Electrification (ACEPT)","OCT 30-NOV 02, 2018OCT 30-NOV 02, 2018",,"Singapore, SINGAPORESingapore, SINGAPORE",1,0,0,0,0,0,1,,,,,978-1-5386-8136-7,,,,,,,,,"Nanyang Technol Univ, Energy Res Inst, Singapore, Singapore",,,,2019-02-27,WOS:000458411400056,,

This technology is proposed as a safe option to store CO2 captured from flue gas of industrial processes and power plants, as well as directly from the atmosphere, in order to overcome the obstacles that still today limit the commercial deployment of other CO2 storage techniques, such as the injection in saline aquifers. By keeping the liquid CO2 separated from the seawater, the technology might be an alternative that presents reduced risk associated with the storage in the marine environment when compared to other alternatives proposed in the past.A Life Cycle Assessment carried out with different combinations of the geographical and technological parameters showed an average impact of 0.10 tCO(2) eq per ton of stored CO2. The process with the highest impact was the capsule production, due mainly to the consumption of natural gas and electricity, as well as to calcination taking place during the production of glass. The availability of space in the seabed for submarine CO2 storage in capsules resulted a minor issue for the development of the technology. Close to most coastal areas where CO2 emission sources are located, large surfaces of the seabed at a suitable depth (between 1500 and 3000 m) and distance from the coast (< 200 km) suitable for this technology are available, and particularly in the Mediterranean and Black seas. A preliminary cost analysis resulted in an average CO2 levelized cost of US$17 per ton of CO2 delivered by the external source. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Although fine-grained gassy soil was found to exhibit different undrained shear strengths (c(u)) by altering the initial pore pressure, u(i) (relevant to water depth), systematic studies concerning the effect of u(i) on undrained shear behaviours of the soil are still lacking. This study reports a series of undrained triaxial tests aiming to compare and investigate the responses of reconstituted fine-grained gassy soil with the same consolidation pressure (p(c)'), but at a wide range of varying u(i) (0-1000 kPa). The shearing-induced excess pore pressure (Delta u) in the gassy specimens highly depends on u(i). It can be either smaller than that of the saturated specimen with the same p(c)' (due to partial dissipation of Delta u into relatively large bubbles at low u(i)) or larger than that of the saturated specimen (related to collapse of relatively small bubbles at high u(i)). Consequently, the presence of bubbles had beneficially increased cu at relatively low u(i) (u(i)/p(c)' < 0.6), and vice versa. The critical stress ratio of the reconstituted fine-grained gassy soil, however, did not appear to be altered by u(i).",,,,,2nd International Conference on Geoenergy and Geoevironment (GeGe)2nd International Conference on Geoenergy and Geoevironment (GeGe),"JUL, 2017JUL, 2017",,"Zhejiang Univ, Hangzhou, PEOPLES R CHINAZhejiang Univ, Hangzhou, PEOPLES R CHINA",43,8,0,0,0,0,46,,,0008-3674,1208-6010,,,,,,,,,,"Zhejiang Univ, Coll Civil Engn & Architecture, Key Lab Offshore Geotech & Mat Zhejiang Prov, Hangzhou 310058, Zhejiang, Peoples R ChinaHong Kong Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Kowloon, Hong Kong, Peoples R ChinaZhejiang Univ, Coll Civil Engn & Architecture, Hangzhou 310058, Zhejiang, Peoples R China",,,,2017-11-19,WOS:000413922000007,,

As part of a local oyster stock enhancement and restoration effort, we conducted a survey for the protozoan pathogen Perkinsus marinus (Dermo) in oysters from a newly established reef. Using standardized methods for the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification of the non-transcribed spacer (NTS) region, we were surprised to find no detectable titers of this pathogen in the 30 oysters sampled in the first year of the project. The detection threshold of the PCR coupled with chemiluminescent detection was 30 fg P. marinus NTS DNA. We were able to detect a trace presence of this pathogen in a few hard clams (Mercenaria mercenaria) from the same locale, indicating that a Perkinsus sp. was present in the Inland Bay system. Subsequent monitoring of the reef system using a fluid thioglycollate assay over 3 yr revealed no epizootic outbreaks of this pathogen within the planted oyster population. Two large mortality episodes that did appear in the oyster population were attributable to abiotic conditions and not pathogen exposure. This study emphasizes that all potential sources of mortality in the environment are important to consider when designing oyster seeding projects. In the Delaware Inland Bays, P. marinus does not appear to have a large enough oyster host population to become a significant disease threat at present. Because of the low parasite incidence levels in the Inland Bay system in 2000, the James Farm oyster reef restoration project presents an ideal model system to follow the population dynamics between an oyster-host population and a latent or reservoir pathogen population.",,,,,,,,,2,0,0,0,1,0,2,,,1559-2723,,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Delaware, Coll Marine Studies, Lewes, DE 19958 USA",,,,2007-02-01,WOS:000245134200015,,

The Utsira sandstone is one of the largest and most widespread sand bodies in the North Sea basin and is identified as a prime target for carbon sequestration due to its large pore volume and ideal subsurface distribution some 800-1200 m beneath the North Sea2. However, its reservoir properties are relatively poorly documented and its top seal capacity to withhold a gas column over human or geological time scales is unknown beyond the immediate vicinity of the successful Sleipner CO2 injection site3. Until 2015, thousands of wells drilled in the North Sea had not encountered any hydrocarbons in the Utsira sandstone raising doubts over its top seal integrity, also questioned by recent (local) studies of seal bypass systems4 and sand injectites5 that affect both the reservoir and its topseal. Existing models for the Utsira sandstone range from deep- to shallow marine and its environment is likely to vary across the basin. The North Sea has been explored for hydrocarbons for over 50 years resulting in a vast legacy database comprising thousands of wells and almost complete 3D seismic coverage allowing unprecedented insights into both reservoir architecture and facies and overburden properties and plumbing systems providing possible pathways for fluid escape into shallower aquifers and eventually to the seabed.This study will leverage state of the art 3D seismic technology calibrated by wells to provide the first basinwide characterization of the Utsira sandstone and its overburden in order to provide a comprehensive inventory of viable carbon injection sites and top seal risk, which will be key to successful implementation of carbon storage for both UK and Norwegian carbon sources. Generic insights regarding the links between deeper structures, reservoir architecture and overburden leakage paths will be extracted to provide insights into the formation of seal bypass systems in general. Shallow gas reservoirs will be examined to avoid misinterpreting imaging artifacts as leakage paths. The methods and insights developed will have general applicability to basin analysis, petroleum exploration and carbon storage, and will yield crucial insights to inform future policy and implementation of carbon storage strategies. in the UK and Norway.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,1982022,,,,,,,,University of Manchester,,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:15355618,,

In this study we focus mainly on the institutional and procedural aspects of the screening and scoping phases of both procedures. This is achieved by reviewing EIA and SEA procedures for analogue projects for the three distinctive process steps of a CCS project, namely the power plant with capture, the transport and finally the underground storage of the CO2. Additionally, EIA and SEA or similar procedures on CCS in other countries are reviewed and the legal framework for the Dutch EIA and SEA is studied. This article shows a concise overview of the EIA and SEA procedure in the Netherlands and the relation between both procedures.

This taxonomy conceptualizes the possible integration of assessing the environmental impacts for tiered levels of decision making. This integration might be needed for first CCS projects as decisions on the strategic (spatial planning) level are currently absent for CCS in the Netherlands. Perpendicular to such integration is the integration of linked activities in the CCS chain and their alternatives, into one procedure. We argue that it would be beneficial to combine the separate EIA procedures for CCS activities into one procedure or at least provide close linkage between them. This issue should be carefully considered by regulators, competent authorities and project initiators in an early stage to avoid delaying legal procedures in the future. For the same reason also early involvement of public, interested parties and the Netherlands Commission for the Environmental Impact Assessment in the scoping phase of the procedures is desired.

This study aims to evaluate and discuss the impacts that will be happened if KJA is applied. Field surveys on hydro-oceanography aspects were done measuring currents, tides, waves, winds, bathymetry, water quality, as well as tourism condition. Based on those hydro-oceanography conditions, Sabang Bay categorized into calm water area where the sea current is weak (ranging from 0-0.12 m/s), whilst the high values of pH, salinity, and temperature are identified within the bay during low tidal condition. If KJA is installed within the bay, automatically it will pollute the water due to the accumulation of remaining fish feeder wastes. Moreover, within the bay, there are several attractive marine tourisms such as diving sites, the conservation area of Sophie Rickmers shipwreck site, and hot bubble (fumaroles hydrothermal vent). The presence of KJA will possibly disrupt marine tourism activities so that the implementation of KJA needs to be considered the impacts before installation.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,2087-9423,2085-6695,,,,,,,,,,"Minist Marine Affairs & Fisheries, Res Inst Coastal Resources & Vulnerabil, Cent Jakarta, Indonesia",,,,2019-09-04,WOS:000482202000015,,

The variability of underwater sound propagation conditions has been investigated in the BIWF area on a temporal scale of months and a spatial scale of kilometers.

To understand how nest substrate and habitat availability influence reproductive success of Brown Pelicans (Pelecanus occidentalis), we monitored 802 nests and quantified vegetation cover on two barrier islands in Louisiana from 2008 to 2010. In 2008, Hurricanes Gustav and Ike caused habitat degradation and land loss at our study sites and thus allowed comparison of pelican productivity in pre- and post-hurricane conditions. As habitat availability changed across years and islands, pelicans shifted from nesting in woody vegetation, to grasses, forbs, and bare ground. More chicks that survived until the age of 3 to 4.5 weeks old were from higher nests, and the loss of woody vegetation might have elicited colony abandonment. Habitat reduction was attributed to hurricane-induced erosion, and shoreline retreat was an average 5.5 times (range 3.3 to 11) greater than regional rates from 1887 to 2002. Furthermore, land loss (16% to 99% of vegetated regions) was restricted to areas without protective breakwaters. In addition to the effects of habitat decline on pelican reproduction, contamination by the Deepwater Horizon oil spill might have further decreased nest success. Large and productive seabird colonies can be rapidly degraded by both human and natural disturbance, making amelioration of such threats a management priority.",,,,,,,,,20,0,0,0,19,1,26,,,0749-0208,1551-5036,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Louisiana Lafayette, Dept Biol, Lafayette, LA 70504 USALouisiana Dept Wildlife & Fisheries, Baton Rouge, LA 70808 USALouisiana Dept Wildlife & Fisheries, Rockefeller Refuge, Grand Chenier, LA 70643 USA",Louisiana Dept Wildlife & FisheriesLouisiana Dept Wildlife & Fisheries,,,2013-12-25,WOS:000327567200019,,

The North Island population, also known as Maui's dolphin, is listed separately as Critically Endangered. The Threat Management Plan for NZ dolphins identifies bycatch in gillnet and trawl fisheries as the number one threat. Fisheries mortality has resulted in rapid population declines, with current total population size estimated at 27% of 1970 numbers. Reduced use of gillnets and trawling in NZ dolphin habitat has slowed population declines in some areas. A long-term study in the Banks Peninsula Marine Mammal Sanctuary (South Island east coast) shows a significant increase in survival rates (by 5.4%) and indicates that the previously rapid population decline has slowed substantially. Nationwide, NZ dolphin populations are predicted to continue declining under current management. This is driven mainly by continuing bycatch in areas with few or no dolphin protection measures (e. g. South Island north and west coasts). Extending protection to the 100 m depth contour throughout NZ dolphin habitat would result in rapid population recovery. This case study shows that area-based management can work, if the protected area is large enough, in the right place, effectively manages key threats, impacts are removed rather than displaced to other areas and no new threats are added (e. g. marine mining, tidal energy generation or pollution).",,,,,,,,,33,0,0,0,27,0,37,,,1863-5407,1613-4796,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2013-01-01,WOS:000318814800003,,

This complex stratigraphic record, however, is dominated by deposits from epeiric seas that are susceptible to local physical and chemical processes decoupled from the open ocean. This study contributes a unique deep water basinal perspective to the Late Ordovician (Hirnantian) glacial record and the perturbations in seawater chemistry that may have contributed to the Hirnantian mass extinction event. We analyze recently drilled cores and outcrop samples from the upper Vinini Formation in central Nevada and report combined trace- and major element geochemistry, Fe speciation (Fe-py/Fe-HR and Fe-HR/F-er), and stable isotope chemostratigraphy (delta C-13(org) and delta S-34(py)). Measurements of paired samples from outcrop and core reveal that reactive Fe is preserved mainly as pyrite in core samples, while outcrop samples have been significantly altered as pyrite has been oxidized and remobilized by modem weathering processes. Fe speciation in the more pristine core samples indicates persistent deep water anoxia, at least locally through the Late Ordovician, in contrast to the prevailing interpretation of increased Hirnantian water column oxygenation in shallower environments. Deep water redox conditions were likely decoupled from shallower environments by a basinal shift in organic matter export driven by decreasing rates of organic matter degradation and decreasing shelf areas. The variable magnitude in the record of the Hirnantian carbon isotope excursion may be explained by this increased storage of isotopically light carbon in the deep ocean which, in combination with increased glacio-eustatic restriction, would strengthen lateral- and vertical gradients in seawater chemistry. We adopt multivariate statistical methods to deconstruct the spatial and temporal re-organization of seawater chemistry during the Hirnantian glaciation and attempt to isolate the latent magnitude and global perturbation in the carbon cycle. We speculate, using a two component mixing model and residual estimates from principal component analysis, that the secular open ocean Hirnantian C isotope excursion possibly amounts to only similar to+1.5 parts per thousand. Such an increase could be mechanistically driven by the combination of sea-level fall, persistent deep water anoxia, and cooler glacial temperatures that increased the organic carbon burial efficiency in the deeper basins.

The discovery of another gas field Zohr in 2015 in the area of the underwater uplift of Eratosthenes caused a real boom among petroleum geologists. The fact is that natural gas deposit with reserves of about 30 trillion cubic feet is not in the terrigenous, but carbonate reservoir of the reef genesis, which opens significant prospects for the discovery of new large gas accumulations in the area of this major uplift. All the above-mentioned deposits are located in the same range of sea depths (1600-2000 m) in the propagation zone of the Messinian evaporites, that serves as a regional screen. An analysis of the materials currently published suggests that in the epochs of the sediments formation in which gas deposits are located, the depths of the seabed in the southern regions of the Levant depression were significantly lower compared to modern ones.

It is very difficult to resolve the problem of transboundary oil and gas in the process for maritime boundary delimitation.The objects of this study are to analyse the international law concerning to the management on the overlapping area and to suggest some options for the conservation and development on the natural resources in the area as a interim arrangement before concluding the on-going negotiation for maritime boundary delimitation between Korea and China. The basic international law which regulate state’s activities in the surrounding area of Ieo-do would be the UNCLOS since Korea and China ratified the convention in 1996 and claimed the Exclusive Economic Zone in the same year respectively.According to the convention, it imposed state parties of dispute an obligation of mutual restraint in order to prevent any activities that endanger or hinder the final delimitation. However, it should interpret that the obligation does not mean to prohibit any activities which would be conducted in the overlapping area but allow some activities which does not involve physical damage to the seabed or subsoil or to their natural resources. In the aspect to conserving the living resources in the surrounding area of Ieo-do, it seems that both countries have not implemented its obligations under Art. 61, Art. 62 and Art. 63 para. 1 as well as Art. 123.

Finally, to resolve the overlapping claims over the continental shelf surround to Ieo-do including the possibility of transboundary oil and gas, Korea ,first of all, should confirm whether the transboundary resources exist on the area or not. Following the confirmation, Korea should prepare the maritime delimitation strategies on the overlapping continental shelf in the area with considering the China’s practice on the issues with Japan and Vietnam.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,1229-2478,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2009-01-01,KJD:ART001399552,,

Information on fine scale behaviour of animals close to operational turbines is required to understand the likely impact of these new technologies. There are inherent challenges associated with measuring the underwater movements of marine animals which have, so far, limited data collection. Here, we describe the development and application of a system for monitoring the three-dimensional movements of cetaceans in the immediate vicinity of a subsea structure. The system comprises twelve hydrophones and software for the detection and localisation of vocal marine mammals. We present data demonstrating the systems practical performance during a deployment on an operational tidal turbine between October 2017 and October 2019. Three-dimensional locations of cetaceans were derived from the passive acoustic data using time of arrival differences on each hydrophone. Localisation accuracy was assessed with an artificial sound source at known locations and a refined method of error estimation is presented. Calibration trials show that the system can accurately localise sounds to 2m accuracy within 20m of the turbine but that localisations become highly inaccurate at distances greater than 35m. The system is currently being used to provide data on rates of encounters between cetaceans and the turbine and to provide high resolution tracking data for animals close to the turbine.

During this time interval the studied area was the site of accumulation of submarine fans that underlie shelf deposits, with tectonic activity responsible for the shallowing upward trend. Turbidites were deposited in both inner (slope fan facies) and outer parts (basin floor fan facies) of the submarine fan system and consist of alternating sandstone and mudstone beds. Sandstones occur in both complete and incomplete Bouma sequences while shelf deposits have been interpreted as storm-surge deposits on the deeper parts of shelves. The 'Mercury Porosimetry Technique' was carried out on 20 sandstone samples, while 30 sandstone samples were examined under a polarizing microscope for grain-size analysis. This porosity-permeability study suggests that these rocks can be considered as both oil and gas reservoirs. 'Slope' fan facies generally reveal the most efficient values, making them the most promising sub-environment for further hydrocarbon research. Most samples display two pore-size distributions suggesting major textural heterogeneity. Textural parameter analysis reveals that sorting was of great importance during sedimentation. Rocks are generally well to very well-sorted while samples with moderate sorting are also present. This fact can be both attributed to the restricted grain-size range and their possible great distance from the source area. This generally well-sorted sequence argues well for further hydrocarbon research in the Northeast Aegean Sea, since the higher the sorting the higher the porosity. Selected samples are generally very fine to fine grained, whereas medium-grained sandstones are extremely rare and mostly seen on 'slope' fan facies.

New ocean energy industries target renewable energy sources thus, on a grand scale, partly mitigating climate change. However, on-site environmental impacts are yet to be established. In this review we compare ocean energy industries with a wide range of conventional, better understood, human activities and outline environmental risks and research priorities. Results show that ocean energy systems are thought to incur many pressures, some familiar and others with yet unknown effects.

Surface water is largely abundant in summer, when it serves as a breeding ground for fish, birds, and mammals. In winter, many mammals and birds are forced to migrate out of the Arctic. Fish must seek out lakes or rivers deep enough to provide good overwintering habitat.Humans in the Arctic rely on surface water in many ways. Surface water meets domestic needs such as drinking, cooking, and cleaning as well as subsistence and industrial demands. Indigenous communities depend on sea ice and waterways for transportation across the landscape and access to traditional country foods.

These results suggest plant palatability as a main limiting factor of consumer metabolical and feeding rates across communities. Hence, across communities, plant nutritional qualify may be regarded as a descriptor of the importance of herbivore control on plant biomass (top-down control), the rapidity of nutrient and energy recycling, and the magnitude of carbon storage.

Yet the triggers to disease epidemics likely involve complex interactions among changing environmental conditions and associated biological communities. In the ocean, understanding disease outbreaks has been hindered by inadequate knowledge of how these various influences interact to determine susceptibility and resilience to disease. This project integrates research in community and disease ecology with microbial genomics, geospatial analysis, and state-of-the-art computational approaches toward an unprecedented understanding of the causes and consequences of wasting disease in eelgrass, an important vegetation type supporting coastal and estuarine ecosystems throughout the northern hemisphere. The research advances frontiers in understanding the growing but poorly appreciated threat of marine diseases, how disease ecology interacts with environmental change, and its consequences for the extensive ecosystems and coastal communities that depend on eelgrass, across 23 degrees of latitude along the Pacific coast of North America. The research will inform better management of threatened seagrass ecosystems, which provide important services including fisheries habitat, erosion control, carbon storage, and capture of nutrient runoff. The research will foster integrative approaches in the next generation, including high school students, undergraduates, graduate students, and postdocs working on the project, and each investigator's institution will work to recruit participants from under-represented groups. Best practices developed under this award, including the Eelisa disease app and drone mapping, will be disseminated for broader surveillance of seagrass disease and coastal habitat quality by both professional and citizen scientists in coordination with the Global Ocean Observing System's (GOOS) develpoment of seagrass extent as an Essential Ocean Variable. The triggers to marine disease epidemics are likely complex, and progress in understanding them has been hindered by a poor understanding of the multifaceted ecological context of the host-disease interaction. This project's overarching goal is to disentangle the web of direct and indirect interactions by which changing climate mediates prevalence of eelgrass wasting disease, and its consequences for threatened but important eelgrass ecosystems. The centerpiece is a comparative, cross-scale survey of eelgrass community composition, microbiome, and disease prevalence along thermal gradients of latitude and exposure to the ocean, providing the first coast-wide picture of disease dynamics in response to environmental change. In situ sampling will be linked to dynamics of eelgrass at landscape scales using unmanned aerial systems (drones) to quantify high-resolution changes in eelgrass extent and habitat quality. Experiments will test how the diverse biological community mediates impacts of the pathogen on eelgrass ecosystems.

In particular, the impact of increased open water duration on lower trophic level productivity and biological CO2 sequestration is poorly understood. Using high-resolution observations of surface seawater dissolved O-2/Ar and pCO(2) collected in the Pacific Arctic in October 2011 and 2012, we evaluate spatial variability in biological metabolic status (autotrophy vs heterotrophy) as constrained by O-2/Ar saturation () as well as the relationship between net biological production and the sea-air gradient of pCO(2) (pCO(2)). We find a robust relationship between pCO(2)and O-2/Ar(correlation coefficient of -0.74 and -0.61 for 2011 and 2012, respectively), which suggests that biological production in the late open water season is an important determinant of the air-sea CO2 gradient at a timeframe of maximal ocean uptake for CO2 in this region. Patchiness in biological production as indicated by O-2/Arsuggests spatially variable nutrient supply mechanisms supporting late season growth amidst a generally strongly stratified and nutrient-limited condition.Plain Language Summary The Arctic is experiencing rapid change. One of the most notable changes is an increase in the length of time coastal areas of the Arctic are ice-free in summer, which may affect the growth patterns of microscopic marine plants at the bottom of the food chain in Arctic ecosystems. We investigate how the growth at the base of the food chain is responding to these sea ice changes in the late, open water period. To track growth, we measure the oxygen content of the surface ocean, which constrains the balance of growth and loss as marine plants photosynthesize and then are consumed and decomposed. We also relate the spatial patterns of net growth to the amount of carbon dioxide (CO2) gas dissolved in the surface ocean to evaluate the potential impact of biological activity on the uptake of this important greenhouse gas into the surface ocean. We find a surprising relationship between growth and areas of CO2 uptake by the ocean. This finding is important because it suggests that the biological community facilitates carbon dioxide uptake during a timeframe when previously growth would be inhibited by ice cover.",,,,,,,,,18,0,0,0,4,0,20,,,2169-9275,2169-9291,,,,,,,,,,"Oregon State Univ, Coll Earth Ocean & Atmospher Sci, Corvallis, OR 97331 USAColumbia Univ, Lamont Doherty Earth Observ, Palisades, NY USANOAA, Arctic Res Program, Silver Spring, MD USAWoods Hole Oceanog Inst, Woods Hole, MA 02543 USA",,,,2019-04-02,WOS:000461856400003,,
J,,,,,,,,,Jonathan Gibbins,,The UK Carbon Capture and Storage Consortium.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Awarded Grant,Jan 03 2006,2006,"Concern is rising about global warming and, more recently recognised, ocean acidification, mainly caused by CO2 released when we use fossil fuels. But it may still take a long time to change from the current situation, where we get most of our energy from fossil fuels, to one where we use much less energy and get a lot of the energy that we do use from renewables and perhaps new nuclear power stations. And it may be difficult to replace fossil fuels for some purposes - for example, to generate electricity when the wind does not blow enough to turn windmills. So what are we to do if we need to make big reductions in the amounts of CO2 from fossil fuels getting into the atmosphere as soon as possible, but cannot reduce their use as fast as we would like without leaving an 'energy gap'? One way to break the link between using fossil fuels and putting CO2 into the atmosphere is to capture the CO2 that is given off when fossil fuels are burnt to make electricity or, in the future, to make hydrogen gas that can be used as a carbon-free fuel. The CO2 can then be injected underground by drilling special boreholes to 1km depth or more. Combined together this is called CO2 capture and storage (CCS). To keep the CO2 underground we need a porous reservoir rock, such as sandstone, with a sealing layer of less permeable rock on top. CCS is obviously not a final solution to climate change, but it does give us time to do all the other, often difficult, things required to move towards a more sustainable world. Running out of fossil fuels is not an immediate problem - these will probably last for at least a century more - but tackling climate change is! It is important that CO2 stays in the ground for at least 10,000 years. We know that oil and gas, often containing CO2, have been trapped underground for millions of years. This proposal looks at how the UK's oil and gas fields might be used in the near future as well-understood places to store CO2. This is also likely to allow more oil to be extracted, and we will study how to make the most of this for the UK economy. We may also need to store additional CO2 underground offshore in deep aquifers, layers of porous rock that are sealed but didn't happen to trap oil and gas in the past and so just contain salty water. We will look at how much CO2 the UK's offshore aquifer rocks can safely hold. There is always a risk that some CO2 will leak into the sea from these geological storage sites. This project will study how this might happen, how to detect it if it does, and what effect it might have on ocean ecosystems. But in any case, when CO2 increases in the atmosphere more CO2 dissolves in the surface layers of seawater, making the water more acid. This work will also show what effects this has. Ways to capture CO2 from power stations and hydrogen plants are fairly well understood, although research is still needed to improve performance and reduce the costs. So what we will concentrate on is how to make the best use of CO2 capture as part of the whole UK energy system, as it is now and as it might develop in the future. To do this we will work closely with other groups in the TSEC programme, particularly UKERC, and other UK and international collaborators. CCS systems will spread across all of the UK, and offshore, so mapping data for the project and seeing how it all fits together will be very helpful. Because CCS has to be a bridge to new energy sources we are particularly interested in how CCS systems can complement renewables, for example by supplying backup electricity or by providing a market to encourage a new biomass fuel industry. CCS would also allow fossil fuels to be used to make hydrogen and so help get a hydrogen economy under way. Finally, beyond the practical, technical and economic factors it is equally important that we understand the social and political aspects that may affect the introduction of CCS as an option for reducing CO2 emissions.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,NE/C516544/1,,,,,,,,University of Cambridge,,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:15320769,,

While these materials have generally been regarded as non-toxic to marine organisms, recent studies have demonstrated negative impacts to suspension feeding organisms. We exposed the arctic-boreal sponge Geodia barretti to the primary particulate components of two water-based drilling muds; barite and bentonite. Sponges were exposed to barite, bentonite and a natural reference sediment at a range of total suspended solid concentrations (TSS = 0,10, 50 or 100 mg/L) for 12 h after which we measured a suite of biomarker responses (lysosomal membrane stability, lipid peroxidation and glutathione). In addition, we compared biomarker responses, organic energy content and metal accumulation in sponges, which had been continuously or intermittently exposed to suspended barite and natural sediment for 14 d at relevant concentrations (10 and 30 mg TSS/L). Lysosomal membrane stability was reduced in the sponges exposed to barite at 50 and 100 mg TSS/L after just 12 h and at 30 mg TSS/L for both continuous and intermittent exposures over 14 d. Evidence of compromised cellular viability was accompanied by barite analysis revealing concentrations of Cu and Pb well above reference sediments and Norwegian sediment quality guidelines. Metal bioaccumulation in sponge tissues was low and the total organic energy content (determined by the elemental composition of organic tissue) was not affected. Intermittent exposures to barite resulted in less toxicity than continuous exposure to barite. Short term exposures to bentonite did not alter any biomarker responses. This is the first time that these biomarkers have been used to indicate contaminant exposure in an arctic-boreal sponge. Our results illustrate the potential toxicity of barite and the importance of assessments that reflect the ways in which these contaminants are delivered under environmentally realistic conditions.

Non-isothermal effects play a major role in all stages of CCS. In this paper, we review the literature on thermal effects related to CCS, which is receiving an increasing interest as a result of the awareness that the comprehension of non-isothermal processes is crucial for a successful deployment of CCS projects. We start by reviewing CO2 transport, which connects the regions where CO2 is captured with suitable geostorage sites. The optimal conditions for CO2 transport, both onshore (through pipelines) and offshore (through pipelines or ships), are such that CO2 stays in liquid state. To minimize costs, CO2 should ideally be injected at the wellhead in similar pressure and temperature conditions as it is delivered by transport. To optimize the injection conditions, coupled wellbore and reservoir simulators that solve the strongly non-linear problem of CO2 pressure, temperature and density within the wellbore and non-isothermal two-phase flow within the storage formation have been developed. CO2 in its way down the injection well heats up due to compression and friction at a lower rate than the geothermal gradient, and thus, reaches the storage formation at a lower temperature than that of the rock. Inside the storage formation, CO2 injection induces temperature changes due to the advection of the cool injected CO2, the Joule-Thomson cooling effect, endothermic water vaporization and exothermic CO2 dissolution. These thermal effects lead to thermo-hydro-mechanical-chemical coupled processes with non-trivial interpretations. These coupled processes also play a relevant role in Utilization options that may provide an added value to the injected CO2, such as Enhanced Oil Recovery (EOR), Enhanced Coal Bed Methane (ECBM) and geothermal energy extraction combined with CO2 storage. If the injected CO2 leaks through faults, the caprock or wellbores, strong cooling will occur due to the expansion of CO2 as pressure decreases with depth. Finally, we conclude by identifying research gaps and challenges of thermal effects related to CCS. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

In New Zealand, one consequence has been a reduction in the obligate riparian spawning habitat of Galaxias maculatus. This diadromous species forms the basis of an important fishery where juveniles are caught as they migrate into freshwater. Spawning success of G. maculatus is closely associated with the nature of available riparian habitat. We used a field experiment in a rural stream to test whether livestock grazing limits egg production and whether there is a lag in increased egg production after protection from grazing because of the recovery time of riparian vegetation. In a separate experiment in an urban stream we tested whether improved riparian management can increase egg production. Livestock exclusion produced an immediate and long-lasting increase in the height and density of riparian vegetation with reduced fluctuations in the ground-level physical environment, and positive changes to the density and survival of eggs. After 4years, egg densities in exclosures were 400 times greater than in grazed controls and egg survival had doubled. Mowing riparian vegetation 2months prior to spawning reduced egg densities by 75% and survival by 25%. Our experiments showed that altering grazing and mowing in spawning sites produced dense riparian vegetation, that this improved the microsite environment and resulted in greatly increased egg deposition and survival over several years. This clearly indicates that the single most effective step in rehabilitating G. maculatus spawning habitat is a simple reduction in grazing/mowing pressure.",,,,,,,,,18,0,0,0,16,1,18,,,1061-2971,1526-100X,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Canterbury, Sch Biol Sci, Marine Ecol Res Grp, Christchurch 8140, New Zealand",,,,2014-05-01,WOS:000336842500010,,

Repairs to the cellular cofferdam structure presented several challenges: difficult environmental conditions such as high bedrock; access only via waterborne equipment; ongoing terminal operations and existing piping utilities. To meet these challenged, the repair needed to meet environmental regulations, need to be constructed in stages; and needed to restore the structural capacity and stability of the cellular cofferdam.

Although the C stocks or storage in terrestrial ecosystems in China have been frequently assessed, the C stocks in mangrove forests have often been overlooked. In this study, we estimated the C stocks and the potential C stocks in China's mangrove forests by combining our own field data with data from the National Mangrove Resource Inventory Report and from other published literature. The results indicate that mangrove forests in China store about 6.91 +/- 0.57 Tg C, of which 81.74% is in the top 1 m soil, 18.12% in the biomass of mangrove trees, and 0.08% in the ground layer (i.e. mangrove litter and seedlings). The potential C stocks are as high as 28.81 +/- 4.16 Tg C. On average, mangrove forests in China contain 355.25 +/- 82.19 Mg C ha(-1), which is consistent with the global average of mangrove C density at similar latitudes, but higher than the average C density in terrestrial forests in China. Our results suggest that C storage in mangroves can be increased by selecting high C-density species for afforestation and stand improvement, and even more by increasing the mangrove area.

J,,,,,,,,,Jonathan Gibbins,,The UK Carbon Capture and Storage Consortium.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Awarded Grant,Feb 28 2006,2006,"Concern is rising about global warming and, more recently recognised, ocean acidification, mainly caused by CO2 released when we use fossil fuels. But it may still take a long time to change from the current situation, where we get most of our energy from fossil fuels, to one where we use much less energy and get a lot of the energy that we do use from renewables and perhaps new nuclear power stations. And it may be difficult to replace fossil fuels for some purposes - for example, to generate electricity when the wind does not blow enough to turn windmills. So what are we to do if we need to make big reductions in the amounts of CO2 from fossil fuels getting into the atmosphere as soon as possible, but cannot reduce their use as fast as we would like without leaving an 'energy gap'? One way to break the link between using fossil fuels and putting CO2 into the atmosphere is to capture the CO2 that is given off when fossil fuels are burnt to make electricity or, in the future, to make hydrogen gas that can be used as a carbon-free fuel. The CO2 can then be injected underground by drilling special boreholes to 1km depth or more. Combined together this is called CO2 capture and storage (CCS). To keep the CO2 underground we need a porous reservoir rock, such as sandstone, with a sealing layer of less permeable rock on top. CCS is obviously not a final solution to climate change, but it does give us time to do all the other, often difficult, things required to move towards a more sustainable world. Running out of fossil fuels is not an immediate problem - these will probably last for at least a century more - but tackling climate change is! It is important that CO2 stays in the ground for at least 10,000 years. We know that oil and gas, often containing CO2, have been trapped underground for millions of years. This proposal looks at how the UK's oil and gas fields might be used in the near future as well-understood places to store CO2. This is also likely to allow more oil to be extracted, and we will study how to make the most of this for the UK economy. We may also need to store additional CO2 underground offshore in deep aquifers, layers of porous rock that are sealed but didn't happen to trap oil and gas in the past and so just contain salty water. We will look at how much CO2 the UK's offshore aquifer rocks can safely hold. There is always a risk that some CO2 will leak into the sea from these geological storage sites. This project will study how this might happen, how to detect it if it does, and what effect it might have on ocean ecosystems. But in any case, when CO2 increases in the atmosphere more CO2 dissolves in the surface layers of seawater, making the water more acid. This work will also show what effects this has. Ways to capture CO2 from power stations and hydrogen plants are fairly well understood, although research is still needed to improve performance and reduce the costs. So what we will concentrate on is how to make the best use of CO2 capture as part of the whole UK energy system, as it is now and as it might develop in the future. To do this we will work closely with other groups in the TSEC programme, particularly UKERC, and other UK and international collaborators. CCS systems will spread across all of the UK, and offshore, so mapping data for the project and seeing how it all fits together will be very helpful. Because CCS has to be a bridge to new energy sources we are particularly interested in how CCS systems can complement renewables, for example by supplying backup electricity or by providing a market to encourage a new biomass fuel industry. CCS would also allow fossil fuels to be used to make hydrogen and so help get a hydrogen economy under way. Finally, beyond the practical, technical and economic factors it is equally important that we understand the social and political aspects that may affect the introduction of CCS as an option for reducing CO2 emissions.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,NE/C516528/1,,,,,,,,University of Reading,,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:15406443,,

These squid are thought to migrate annually from Mexican waters into the CCS where they prey on many species, including several that support lucrative fisheries; however, swimming capabilities and features of long-distance horizontal migrations are not well understood. In the present study, adult Humboldt squid were tagged off central California with pop-up archival transmitting (PAT) tags (n = 5). All squid ex hibited diel vertical migrations and swam south or offshore (west) during tag deployment (2.7 to 17.6 d). One squid swam south at least 34 km d(-1) for >17 d and crossed into Mexican waters, which is the highest sustained velocity and the longest horizontal migration observed thus far for Humboldt squid. Results from a simple model to estimate the daily locations and velocities of each squid throughout the deployments suggest an average velocity of similar to 37 km d(-1) and a maximum of similar to 50 km d(-1). Additionally, the model suggests that one squid made a bidirectional movement (first north and then returning south) that was not evident from deployment and pop-up positions alone.

We examined the environmental factors associated with the locations of desert tortoise burrows at a site developed for wind energy generation. Measurements were taken at the opening of burrows, including elevation, slope, aspect, and distance to various natural and anthropogenic features of the landscape. We compared this data set with identical measurements for random points that lacked burrows in the same landscape. The analysis demonstrated that desert tortoises within the study area did not randomly select their burrow sites. Desert tortoise burrows were located closer to roads and concrete foundations associated with wind energy turbines and transformers than were random points. The results challenge the paradigm that desert tortoises are negatively affected by all forms of anthropogenic disturbance and suggest that with proper planning, some forms of development in the desert are compatible with conservation of sensitive species.",,,,,,,,,46,1,0,0,40,1,56,,,1071-8443,,,,,,,,,,,"Western Ecological Research Center, United States Geological Survey, California State University, 6000 J Street, Placer Hall, Sacramento, CA, 95819-6129, USA",,,,2000-11-01,BCI:BCI200100083848,,

This report aims to provide the reader with an overview of the contaminant sources, types, and risks in the Pacific North Coast Integrated Management Area (PNCIMA) as these relate to marine environmental quality (MEQ), and builds on two previously published reports generated for sub-regions of the PNCIMA, namely the central coast (Haggarty et al. 2003) and the north coast and Queen Charlotte Islands (Johannessen et al. 2007). The PNCIMA includes 102,000 km2 of ocean, covering roughly two-thirds of the BC coast. While sparsely populated (3.3% of BC's total population), the PNCIMA is faced with a growing list of threats to MEQ.The PNCIMA extends from the southern end of Johnstone Strait and the Brooks Peninsula on Vancouver Island northwards to the British Columbia (BC) - Alaska border and includes the marine area out as far as the base of the continental slope, and the Queen Charlotte Islands (Figure 1.1). The region is rugged, with a steep, glaciated mainland covered in dense rainforest and bisected by numerous fjords and inlets, while the coast is dominantly rocky and strewn with islands. The influence of two semi-permanent atmospheric pressure cells (the Aleutian Low and the North Pacific High) over the Pacific Ocean provides this area with some of the highest rainfall amounts in Canada, along with mild winters and cool summers.The remote location and low population would suggest that there are few anthropogenic stresses in the area. However, a number of human activities take place in the area that can affect MEQ. Key among the past and present activities are aquaculture, vessel traffic, ports / harbours / marinas, forestry, pulp and paper, mining / smelting, ocean dumping, Coast Guard / military sites, oil and gas, and global pollutants. In many cases, source control and regulations have mitigated some of these activities, including a reduction in the by-production of dioxins and furans by pulp mills, the elimination of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and many organochlorine (OC) pesticides, and restrictions on the use of tributyltin on ship hulls as an antifoulant. However, a number of emerging threats to MEQ in the PNCIMA reflect growing industrial sectors, and include the potential exploration and extraction of offshore oil and gas, a significant increase in cruise ship traffic, expanding port facilities, and the expanding aquaculture sector.",,,,,,,,,3,0,0,0,3,0,4,,,0706-6457,0706-6570,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2007-01-01,BCI:BCI200700467579,,

Two fast-growing mangrove species of the genus Sonneratia, the native S. caseolaris and non-native S. apetala, have been widely used for mangrove reforestation in China; however their ability to sequester carbon is still unclear. The present study aimed to estimate the growth, carbon accumulation in biomass and carbon sequestration in sediments of these two species, in both mixed (50% S. caseolaris: 50% S. apetala) and monoculture plantations, in the intertidal zones of Shenzhen Bay, Guangdong Province, China. Twenty-five months of observation showed strong competition between the two species in the mixed plantation, with the native S. caseolaris outcompeting the non-native S. apetala due to a faster growth rate. Although S. caseolaris in the mixed plantation had lower carbon storage in biomass than in monoculture, carbon accumulation in sediment was higher in the mixed plantation. Thus, the relative advantage of the mixed plantation was in sequestering more carbon in sediment, as opposed to high carbon accumulation to biomass. These results indicated that the mixed plantation could be a good option for mangrove restoration and carbon sequestration of sediment. However, the two and a half years of this study may not indicate long-term trends, so more research on long-term species performance is essential for successful mangrove reforestation.

One of the main culprits is dissolved oxygen, which the offshore operators actively remove with vacuum and chemical oxygen scavengers. The vacuum deaerators have a removal limit, after which the dissolved oxygen concentration is decreased using chemical oxygen scavengers most often sodium sulfite, but this adds a cost. The main expense is not the chemical itself, but the side product of the chemical reaction, which leaves sulfates, that feed sulfate reducing bacteria, leading to a production of Hydrogen sulfide which leads to sour corrosion.

There is growing evidence that sites of dense water formation over the continental shelf, such as the Northern Adriatic Sea, play a key role in this process. Nevertheless, little is known about the inorganic carbon chemistry of the Adriatic sea, and CO2 absorption and its fate.The winter of 2012 experienced peculiar meteorological conditions with an extended period of cold weather with strong winds that triggered, in February, a massive formation of an extremely cold and dense (potential density anomaly >30.00 kg m(-3)) Northern Adriatic Dense Water (NAdDW) water mass. This event provided a unique opportunity to study this process at sub-basin scale taking into account CO2 adsorption within the NAdDW source area (the Gulf of Trieste in the northern Adriatic), and its spreading over the shelf and into the Southern Adriatic Pit. The northern Adriatic and the Gulf of Trieste, during winter, act as a CO2 sink. The average air-sea CO2 flux of 60 mmol m(-2) d(-1) estimated during the exceptional 2012 event was at least 3 times higher than the flux measured in winter 2008 when dense water was produced through the same mechanism but under less extreme conditions. In winter 2012, absorbed CO2 resulted in the decrease of pH(T25) down to 7.907 (- 0.034 pH(T) units) and the strong evaporation induced by wind-increased total alkalinity (TA) to 2673 (+ 16 mu mol kg(-1)).Following its formation in the North, the NAdDW plume entering the Southern Adriatic, observed in March 2012, exhibited significantly modified values. The plume was characterized by colder temperature (similar to 10 degrees C), lower pH(T25) (7.947 pH(T) units) and higher alkalinity (2635 mu mol kg(-1)) than the surrounding water masses along the western Adriatic shelf. However, the signal of atmospheric CO2 enrichment was weaker than in the northern Adriatic source region, as well as positive apparent oxygen utilization (AOU) values (similar to 20 mu mol kg(-1)) were recorded. This is suggestive of oxygen consumption in the water mass.Observed changes in both physical and biogeochemical properties were similar to those observed in 2008, suggesting that mixing with Levantine Intermediate Waters (LIW) was the main driver modulating the changes of AOU and inorganic carbon chemistry in both winters. The rising of pH(T25) and AOU due to the mixing indicates that NAdDW, at its origin, was richer in atmospheric CO2 than the LIW was, thus confirming the relevance of the Northern Adriatic Sea for CO2 adsorption.The study provides the first characterization of inorganic carbon chemistry, including carbonate minerals saturation states (Omega(Ar) and Omega(Ca)), in the bottom waters both on the slope and along the expected pathways of dense water cascading in the Adriatic Sea. Therefore, it can represent a baseline to improve the knowledge on the acidification process and impacts as well as being useful for comparison with other benthic environments. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Although the successive environmental disasters were well documented, information on its sedimentary record is lacking. The present research aims at filling this gap, through the analysis of organic contaminants (PCBs, PAHs, and PBDEs) in a dated sediment core collected in the depocenter of the Karamursel Basin in 2005. Profiles of total PCBs and total PAHs overlap the timing of industrialization in the area (starting in the 1960s) with values increasing as the population and the number of industrial plants grew larger. Profiles for PBDEs are in accordance with increasing urban inputs but are probably affected by processes of natural formation and post-depositional mixing. The continuous sedimentary record is interrupted at a level dating back to 1980 due to the erosion caused by the 1999 earthquake, having removed a 5-7 cm thick sediment layer. Contaminant concentrations in the deepest 10-15 cm of a 30 cm thick seismo-turbidite unit, triggered by the 1999 event, increase with the progressive fining up and evidence massive transport of sediments from coastal, more polluted sites of the north-eastern Karamursel shelves and shores. Additional inputs of PAHs are also evident, originating from a fire at the oil refinery that followed the shaking. The effects of the earthquake generated tsunami, its backwash fluxes and the following seiches are not uniquely displayed by each class of contaminants, and they could probably reflect successive inputs deriving from different parts of the basin that are subject to anthropogenic impacts of different nature. Concentrations measured at the top of the core are consistent with an unvaried input of pollutants in the period 1980-2005. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Examination of microbial degradation in two pine and four oak samples from three historical shipwrecks situated in the Baltic Sea are carried out by light microscopy. Type, degree and amount of wood degradation by fungal and bacterial processes is compared to results on sulfur and iron accumulation studied by X-Ray Fluorescence (XRF) scanning. The highest accumulation of iron and sulfur is found in the surface layers (0-2 cm), where microbial degradation is also most intense. A novel finding is that both decay by erosion bacteria- and soft rot fungi promotes accumulation. Our results also imply that accumulation of inorganic sulfur and iron in archaeological wood involves several different processes which might include solely chemical as well as biogeochemical processes.

We found 1443 records for 317 species. The Bryozoa were the most prevalent phylum in terms of numbers of records and species, but 2 invasive ascidians were the most frequently reported species. Among all species, 9.1% of the fauna have been reported to be invasive. Most species were represented by only 1 to 3 records, suggesting that this fauna has been underrepresented in the literature. The number of species estimated per state peaked in Florida, North Carolina, and Massachusetts, where provincial faunas overlap. Although Cape Cod in Massachusetts and Cape Hatteras in North Carolina represent putative faunal boundaries along the east coast, 63% of the fouling organisms have distributional limits which extend well beyond one or both of these capes. A large proportion of this fauna is widely distributed from New England to the South Atlantic Bight, yet 22 northern species and 96 southern species have restricted distributions. Analysis of community-level studies also revealed regional differences, especially between New England and southern states. These patterns are indicative of latitudinal variation and the transitional nature of this fauna.

In organisms that increase greatly in size during ontogeny the size and abundance of refuges is particularly important, because population-regulating factors may operate strongly on only one size class or ontogenetic stage within a population, creating a demographic bottleneck. I test the demographic bottleneck hypothesis in stone crabs by first supplementing shelter with five different sizes of polyvinyl chloride (PVC) pipe at eight sites in St. Joseph Bay, Florida to determine the size class most likely to be shelter limited. I then used tethering experiments, cage studies, and natural observations to ask if habitat structural complexity regulates the stone crab population through its size-specific effects on growth, survival, and fecundity.Shelter availability appears to create a demographic bottleneck that affects the growth and fecundity of large crabs. In both 1991 and 1992, and largest PVC pipes were occupied in significantly greater proportions than smaller pipes, suggesting that this shelter size class is limiting. Predation is size specific; smaller individuals are at significant risk but no large crabs were taken by predators. However, shelter is particularly important for the growth of large crabs. There was a fivefold increase in molting individuals on shelter-supplemented sites relative to natural densities suggesting that the bottleneck size class has been identified correctly and that shelter additions can alleviate the bottleneck. Supplemental shelters also particularly attracted gravid females and, in tethering experiments, females with shelter produce egg masses twice as quickly as females without shelter. These results differ from most prior results in marine populations in two ways. First, it is factors affecting adults and not juveniles that may regulate the stone crab populations. Second, refuge use in those size classes likely to be shelter limited is not explained primarily by predation, but by effects on growth and fecundity. The evidence suggests the merits of the demographic bottleneck hypothesis; habitat structural complexity may affect both the size of populations and the size of individuals within the population.",,,,,,,,,131,0,0,0,82,3,144,,,0012-9658,1939-9170,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1995-04-01,WOS:A1995QU35800025,,

And it may be difficult to replace fossil fuels for some purposes - for example, to generate electricity when the wind does not blow enough to turn windmills. So what are we to do if we need to make big reductions in the amounts of CO2 from fossil fuels getting into the atmosphere as soon as possible, but cannot reduce their use as fast as we would like without leaving an 'energy gap'? One way to break the link between using fossil fuels and putting CO2 into the atmosphere is to capture the CO2 that is given off when fossil fuels are burnt to make electricity or, in the future, to make hydrogen gas that can be used as a carbon-free fuel. The CO2 can then be injected underground by drilling special boreholes to 1km depth or more. Combined together this is called CO2 capture and storage (CCS). To keep the CO2 underground we need a porous reservoir rock, such as sandstone, with a sealing layer of less permeable rock on top. CCS is obviously not a final solution to climate change, but it does give us time to do all the other, often difficult, things required to move towards a more sustainable world. Running out of fossil fuels is not an immediate problem - these will probably last for at least a century more - but tackling climate change is! It is important that CO2 stays in the ground for at least 10,000 years. We know that oil and gas, often containing CO2, have been trapped underground for millions of years. This proposal looks at how the UK's oil and gas fields might be used in the near future as well-understood places to store CO2. This is also likely to allow more oil to be extracted, and we will study how to make the most of this for the UK economy. We may also need to store additional CO2 underground offshore in deep aquifers, layers of porous rock that are sealed but didn't happen to trap oil and gas in the past and so just contain salty water. We will look at how much CO2 the UK's offshore aquifer rocks can safely hold. There is always a risk that some CO2 will leak into the sea from these geological storage sites. This project will study how this might happen, how to detect it if it does, and what effect it might have on ocean ecosystems. But in any case, when CO2 increases in the atmosphere more CO2 dissolves in the surface layers of seawater, making the water more acid. This work will also show what effects this has. Ways to capture CO2 from power stations and hydrogen plants are fairly well understood, although research is still needed to improve performance and reduce the costs. So what we will concentrate on is how to make the best use of CO2 capture as part of the whole UK energy system, as it is now and as it might develop in the future. To do this we will work closely with other groups in the TSEC programme, particularly UKERC, and other UK and international collaborators. CCS systems will spread across all of the UK, and offshore, so mapping data for the project and seeing how it all fits together will be very helpful. Because CCS has to be a bridge to new energy sources we are particularly interested in how CCS systems can complement renewables, for example by supplying backup electricity or by providing a market to encourage a new biomass fuel industry. CCS would also allow fossil fuels to be used to make hydrogen and so help get a hydrogen economy under way. Finally, beyond the practical, technical and economic factors it is equally important that we understand the social and political aspects that may affect the introduction of CCS as an option for reducing CO2 emissions.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,NE/C516428/1,,,,,,,,University of Glasgow,,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:15394388,,

Landslides may be triggered by a reduction in shear strength of subsea sediments over a given zone, caused for example by seismic activity. Simple criteria are then needed to identify critical conditions whereby the zone of weakness could grow catastrophically to cause a landslide. A number of such criteria have been developed over the last decade, based either on ideas drawn from fracture mechanics, or considering the equilibrium of the initial weakened zone and adjacent process zones of gradually softening material. Accounting for the history of the weak zone initiation is critical for derivation of reliable propagation criteria, in particular considering dynamic effects arising from accumulating kinetic energy of the failing material, which will allow the failure to propagate from a smaller initial zone of weakened sediments. Criteria are developed here for planar conditions, taking full account of such dynamic effects, which are shown to be capable of reducing the critical length of the softened zone by 20% or more compared with criteria based on static conditions. A numerical approach is used to solve the governing dynamic equations for the sliding material, the results from which justify assumptions that allow analytical criteria to be developed for the case where the initial softening occurs instantaneously. The effect of more gradual softening is also explored.

Some sources of renewable energy being considered will include power generation infrastructure and support activities located within continental shelf waters, and potentially within deeper waters off the U.S. Pacific coast and beyond state waters (i.e., outside three nautical miles). Currently, the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) is considering renewable energy proposals off the coast of Oregon, California, and Hawaii. From 19992002, the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) and Humboldt State University (HSU) worked with BOEM (formely known as the Minerals Management Service, MMS) to conduct a multi-year study that quantified the at-sea distribution of seabirds and marine mammals. The aerial at-sea survey team flew over 55,000 kilometers and counted 485,000 seabirds (67 species) and 64,000 marine mammals (19 species). The study provided resource managers with updated information on distribution and abundance patterns and compared results with information from the late 1970s to early 1980s (Briggs et al. 1981, Briggs et al. 1987, see Mason et al. 2007). The California Department of Fish and Wildlife (CDFW; formerly known as California Department of Fish and Game, CDFG) and U.S. Navy also provided significant matching funds.Oceanographic Context - USGS-HSU surveys began in May 1999, immediately following the strong 19971998 El Nio event. The 19992002 period featured a series of cold-water, La Nia events which led some researchers to postulate that the California Current System (CCS) had undergone a fundamental climate shift, on the scale of those documented in the 1920s, mid 1940s, and mid 1970s (Schwing et al. 2002). Generally, La Nia events have corresponded with stronger than normal upwelling in the CCS, and during this period, resulted in the greatest 4-yr mean upwelling index value on record (Schwing et al. 2002). La Nias often follow El Nios, and seabird community composition (i.e., relative species-specific abundances) in any given year off southern California, is subject to variability caused by shifts in distribution among both warm- and cool-water affiliated species (Hyrenbach and Veit 2003). In contrast to the Mason et al. (2007) surveys, Briggs et al. (1987) conducted surveys during 19751983, coincident with another climate shiftfrom cold to warm conditions throughout the CCS (Mantua et al. 1997). Briggs et al. surveyed north of Point Conception during 19801983, after the transition to warmer water conditions occurred in the CCS.Acknowledgements - This project was funded by BOEM through an Interagency Agreement with the U.S. Geological Survey.

In order to sustain multiple ecosystem services, understanding ecosystem services capacity across heterogeneous forest types and identifying certain ecosystem services that could be managed to leverage positive effects across the wider bundle of ecosystem services are required. We sampled three forest types, tropical rainforests, sclerophyll forests, and rehabilitated plantation forests, over an area of 32,000 m(2) from Wet Tropics bioregion, Australia, aiming to compare supply and evaluate interactions and patterns of eight ecosystem services (global climate regulation, air quality regulation, erosion regulation, nutrient regulation, cyclone protection, habitat provision, energy provision, and timber provision). On average, multiple ecosystem services were highest in the rainforests, lowest in sclerophyll forests, and intermediate in rehabilitated plantation forests. However, a wide variation was apparent among the plots across the three forest types. Global climate regulation service had a synergistic impact on the supply of multiple ecosystem services, while nutrient regulation service was found to have a trade-off impact. Considering multiple ecosystem services, most of the rehabilitated plantation forest plots shared the same ordination space with rainforest plots in the ordination analysis, indicating that rehabilitated plantation forests may supply certain ecosystem services nearly equivalent to rainforests. Two synergy groups and one trade-off group were identified. Apart from conserving rainforests and sclerophyll forests, our findings suggest two additional integrated pathways to sustain the supply of multiple ecosystem services from a heterogeneous tropical forest landscape: (i) rehabilitation of degraded forests aiming to provide global climate regulation and habitat provision ecosystem services and (ii) management intervention to sustain global climate regulation and habitat provision ecosystem services.

Solutions to intermittency include the use of rapid-response backup generation and chemical or mechanical storage of electricity. Meanwhile, in many jurisdictions with lengthy heating seasons, finding secure and preferably environmentally benign supplies of energy for space heating is also becoming a significant challenge because of volatile energy markets.Most, if not all, electricity suppliers treat these twin challenges as separate issues: supply (integrating intermittent renewables) and demand (electric space heating). However, if space heating demand can be met from an intermittent supply of electricity, then both of these issues can be addressed simultaneously. One such approach is to use off-the-shelf electric thermal storage systems.This paper examines the potential of this approach by applying the output from a 5.15 MW wind farm to the residential heating demands of detached households in the Canadian province of Prince Edward Island. The paper shows that for the heating season considered, up to 500 households could have over 95 percent of their space heating demand met from the wind farm in question.

However, their stratigraphic nomenclature is inconsistently applied, and a basin-wide stratigraphic framework that is ubiquitously agreed upon remains elusive. In particular, a sandy transitional sandstone interval that occurs above the main Precipice Sandstone reservoir unit has caused confusion about how the two units should be subdivided. To address this issue, we integrate core observations with seismic interpretation and wireline log correlation to construct a sequence stratigraphic framework for the Lower Jurassic System that goes beyond lithostratigraphy.The main findings of our work include: (1) the identification of three 3rd-order sequences, SQ1-SQ3, from base to top. Two main sandstone intervals, the Precipice Sandstone and the Boxvale Sandstone Member (Evergreen Formation), represent the lowstand systems tracts (LSTs) of SQ1 and SQ3, respectively. The Westgrove Ironstone Member in the upper Evergreen Formation - a distinctive oolitic ironstone unit represents the transgressive system tract (TST) of SQ3; (2) the transitional interval above the main Precipice Sandstone reservoir corresponds to the lower TST in SQl (lower Evergreen Formation). It is manifest as an upward-fining succession with a retrogradational facies stacking pattern, and is significantly different from the main Precipice Sandstone reservoir which shows an aggradational stacking pattern; (3) the Precipice Sandstone and lower Evergreen Formation progressively onlap the western and the eastern margins of the Surat Basin, and this confines the Precipice Sandstone to the central portion of the basin; (4) the three sequences (SQ1-SQ3) approximately coincide with global sea-level cycles documented from the early Jurassic. Two episodes of accelerated tectonic subsidence were responsible for the thinning and onlap of SQl and SQ3 onto the basin margins. In contrast, weaker tectonic subsidence was responsible for the overall finer grained sediment, the uniformity in thickness, and widespread distribution of SQ2.The results of our stratigraphic analysis indicate that the architecture of the reservoir and seal significantly differs from previous thinking, such that: (1) the Precipice Sandstone, the main reservoir unit, has a distribution that is limited to the basin centre; (2) the transitional interval above the main Precipice Sandstone reservoir forms poorly-connected, localized reservoirs that onlap and backstep towards the basin margins; and, (3) SQ2 and SQ3 are sealing units because they are very widespread and mud-dominated.Viewing the Precipice Sandstone and Evergreen Formation from a sequence stratigraphic standpoint provides important information about how to subdivide them and helps clarify the stratal relationships that were previously unclear from a mixture of terminology.

The concentration of CO2 in the earth atmosphere is an important control on earth surface temperature, and hence climate. CO2 dissolution in the oceans is also being recognised as an important factor in making surface seawater unusually acid / this severely affects ecosystems and species from algae to fish and whales. Increased CO2 in the atmosphere is recognised as being partly caused by burning of fossil fuels, such as coal and gas, in power stations. Carbon Capture and Storage is a suite of technologies which enables CO2 to be captured at power stations, liquefied by increasing the pressure, transported by a pipe, and injected deep underground in to pore space of deeply buried sedimentary rocks such as sandstones. This can effectively remove CO2 from the power cycle of fossil fuel use, and store the CO2 for tens of thousands of years, which enables the earth atmosphere to return to normal. Because of the very large CO2 volumes involved, it is not possible to build surface stores. Because of the acid effects of CO2, it is not possible to inject CO2 into seawater. By contrast, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) have calculated that more than 25% of world CO2 emissions could be stored by geological CCS. This could be a vital technology for the world's future. There is a great deal of interest worldwide in CCS and, because of the offshore oil industry, the North Sea is one of the world's prime areas for CCS to be rapidly developed. However, there are only three full-scale projects at present in the world. For UK power generating companies to become commercially interested the chain of technologies must be both demonstrated to work reliably, and must be capable of cost-effective development. This project is trying to identify aquifer sites deep underground which are close to power plant in the U.K., where CO2 can be safely stored, but sites are quicker and cheaper to develop than offshore in the North Sea. This can enable power generating companies to develop CCS over a period of years, on a medium scale, and learn to conduct the industrial operation. If this project is successful, it could lead to take up of CCS in the U.K. 10 or 15 years earlier than waiting for an infrastructure of large North Sea pipelines to be developed for CO2. When those pipes become available, UK power companies will be completely ready to connect power plant to store CO2 in large redundant hydrocarbon fields offshore. This could save many tens of million tons CO2 per year being emitted into the atmosphere from the U.K., and place the U.K. in the forefront of carbon reduction nations. The universities and companies involved in this 2.3M consortium are all experienced in investigating the deep subsurface for oil and gas production. Edinburgh, Heriot-Watt and BGS already have 1.6M from the Scottish Executive to establish the UK's largest research grouping to investigate CO2 storage. This expertise will be transferred to exploring for CO2 disposal sites. Using the information held by the British Geological Survey, maps will be made of the subsurface deep beneath England, and deep beneath the Forth estuary. Heriot-Watt university will assess the potential chemical reactions of CO2 with rock, and how much CO2 can be injected. Electricity generators, led by Scottish Power, will make engineering designs for modified power stations to supply CO2. Schlumberger and Marathon Oil, will assess the subsurface technology required for safe and reliable injection and monitoring. The University of Edinburgh will make computer simulations to determine if CO2 will leak deep below ground, and will assess how specific site is storage sites will perform to safely retain CO2. Amec will evaluate transport of CO2 by pipe. Tyndall will investigate the public attitudes at the candidate storage sites.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,DT/F007744/1,,,,,,,,University of Edinburgh,,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:15347966,,

These intensive rosters, worked in a demanding physical and psychosocial environment, are potential sources of fatigue and impaired performance among offshore personnel. This article focuses on offshore working time arrangements, and presents a systematic review of studies which examine offshore day/night shift patterns in relation to operational safety and individual health risks. Of the 53 studies retrieved, 24 met the review criteria.Field study findings are generally consistent in showing that sleep, alertness and performance are relatively stable across day-shift tours; initial night shifts are adversely affected by circadian disruption, but full physiological and psychological adaptation occurs within 5-6 days; re-adaptation to day shifts is slower, and varies widely across individuals; the offshore environment is conducive to night-shift adaptation, but interventions to facilitate re-adaptation have proved only modestly effective. Analyses of survey data and accident/sickness records identify offshore night work as a risk factor for impaired sleep, health problems, and injuries, but little is known about the long-term health effects of different offshore shift rotations.In conclusion, research methodology and findings, and working time issues of current concern to the offshore oil/gas industry, are discussed. Aspects of offshore work schedules that have been not been widely studied (e.g. overtime, irregular work patterns) are also highlighted, and research areas that would merit further attention are noted.

As climate change leads to warmer, more acidic, and less oxygenated oceans, species are shifting away from their historical distribution ranges, and these trends are expected to continue into the future. Correlative Species Distribution Models (SDMs) can be used to project future habitat extent for marine species, with many different statistical methods available. However, it is vital to assess how different statistical methods behave under novel environmental conditions before using these models for management advice, and to consider whether future projections based on these techniques are biologically reasonable. In this study, we built SDMs for adults and larvae of two ecologically important pelagic fishes in the California Current System (CCS): Pacific sardine (Sardinops sagax) and northern anchovy (Engraulis mordax). We used five different SDM methods, ranging from simple [thermal niche model (TNM)] to complex (artificial neural networks). Our results show that some SDMs trained on data collected between 2003 and 2013 lost substantial predictive skill when applied to observations from more recent years, when ocean temperatures associated with a marine heatwave were outside the range of historical measurements. This decrease in skill was particularly apparent for adult sardine, which showed non-stationary relationships between catch locations and sea surface temperature (SST) through time. While sardine adults and larvae shifted their distributions markedly during the marine heatwave, anchovy largely maintained their historical spatiotemporal distributions. Our results suggest that correlative relationships between species and their environment can become unreliable during anomalous conditions. Understanding the underlying physiology of marine species is therefore essential for the construction of SDMs that are robust to rapidly changing environments. Developing distribution models that offer skillful predictions into the future for species such as sardine and anchovy, which are migratory and include separate sub-stocks, may be particularly challenging.

Their evolution is spatially complex and multifactorial, influenced mostly by ecological and physical drivers such as tidal range, wave energy, hydrologic components and climatic conditions. Saltmarshes can respond positively to climate change due to their adaptiveness especially in areas provided with high tidal energy. While the conditions and determinants of marsh evolution are known locally, the spatial mapping of such processes across time is strongly expected.It is hereby proposed to study the interactions of the spatial evolution of Beaussais' Bay saltmarsh (France) from 1948 to 2013 by means of ocean-climate data. Time series of the saltmarsh spatial response, based on five high resolution aerial photographs, were explained by a multiple linear regression on continuous temperature, precipitation and mean sea level data. The model significantly explained the average horizontal accretion of the marsh platform by local warming and rising sea-level (Pearson's correlation coefficient r=0.63, RMSE=5.22). The increase in temperature explains best the model (R-2=0.88), while sea-level and precipitation are secondary predictors (R-2=0.16 and R-2=0.11, respectively). The model enabled fine-resolution mapping to be predicted based on both IPCC ocean-climate scenarios and historical trends of the marsh surface up to 2100. The findings confirm the trends observed so far, enhancing the importance of saltmarsh conservation as a coastal protection.

Based on gas isotope data, approximately one-third of the in-place petroleum volume is gas of biogenic origin. The source for all the thermogenic petroleum thus far discovered is interpreted to be a marine, siliciclastic facies of upper Cretaceous age, the eastern continuation of organic-rich deposits that occur all along the northern margin of the South American craton. Oil compositional variation indicates a progressive change from carbonate to siliciclastic source rocks eastward from Venezuela, through Trinidad, and into the Columbus basin.The thermogenic product ratio (gas vs. oil) in the Columbus basin varies geographically, being oil-dominated (60-70%) in the northwestern part of the basin and gas-dominated (similar to90%) farther southeast. Subtle changes in oil and condensate geochemistry between these two areas can be explained by more terrestrial-derived kerogen and more oxidizing conditions in the southeastern part of the basin. We interpret this variation to be the result of a southward transition from a slope to shelf depositional environment during source rock deposition. A southward decrease in source rock HI from the slope to shelf deposits is interpreted to be the dominant factor controlling the observed thermogenic product distribution (gas fraction) of petroleum fields within the basin. Although significant thermal maturity variations occur across the basin, this is not the primary controlling factor on the geographic distribution of oil and gas. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

The development of unstable flow in multiphase pipelines is a major and expensive problem. The irregular flow results in poor oil/water separation, limits the production capacity, and causes flaring. Handling slug flow thus has become very important with regard to increasing the production rate and avoiding possible equipment damages.In this paper, we have developed a model of a physical process that generates slugs. The model has been verified against experimental data. Several control strategies have been tested on the model, and the simulation results are presented.

For the first time, pressure coring of shallow sediments and drilling of more than 50 m-long cores with the sea floor drill rig MARUM-MeBo70 were conducted in this pockmark.

Two independent pore water chloride and sulfate modeling approaches suggest that a major methane migration event occurred during the past one to three centuries.

Even moderate currents can induce vortex shedding, alternately at the top and bottom of the pipeline, at a rate determined by the flow velocity. Each time a vortex sheds, a force is generated in both the in-line and cross-flow direction, causing an oscillatory multi-mode vibration. This vortex induced vibration can give rise to fatigue damage. of submarine pipeline spans, especially in the vicinity of the girth welds.In this paper, an integrated numerical framework is presented to predict and identify free spans that may be vulnerable to fatigue damage caused by vortex induced vibrations (VIV). An elegant and efficient algorithm is introduced to simulate offshore pipeline installation on an uneven seabed. Once the laydown simulation has been completed, the free spans can be automatically detected. When the fatigue screening for both in-line and cross-flow VIV indicates that a particular span may be prone to vortex induced vibrations, a detailed fatigue analysis is required.Amplitude response models are constructed to predict the maximum steady state VIV amplitudes for a given pipeline configuration (mechanical properties) and sea state (hydrodynamic parameters). The vibration amplitudes are translated into corresponding stress ranges, which then provide an input for the fatigue analysis.

Juvenile southern flounder (Paralichthys lethostigma) were exposed for 28d in the laboratory under controlled conditions to reference and Deepwater Horizon oil-contaminated sediments collected from coastal Louisiana to assess the impacts on an ecologically and commercially important benthic fish. The measured polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) concentrations in the sediments ranged from 0.25mg/kg to 3940mg/kg suite of 50 PAH analytes (tPAH50). Mortality increased with both concentration and duration of exposure. Exposed flounder length and weight was lower compared to controls after 28d of exposure to the sediments with the highest PAH concentration, but condition factor was significantly higher in these fish compared with all other treatments. Histopathological analyses showed increased occurrence of gill abnormalities, including telangiectasis, epithelial proliferation, and fused lamellae in flounder exposed to sediments with the highest tPAH50 concentrations. In addition, hepatic vascular congestion and macrovesicular vacuolation were observed in flounder exposed to the more contaminated sediments. These data suggest that chronic exposure to field collected oil-contaminated sediments results in a variety of sublethal impacts to a benthic fish, with implications for long-term recovery from oil spills.

An interaction of geological processes and intense anthropogenic activities, e.g., construction of buildings, harbors, oil and gas pipelines, hydroengineering facilities, and land reclamation, has resulted in hazard potential, especially for the densely populated areas of the Russian Baltic coastal zone. These hazards may in addition be harmful for the sensitive ecosystem of the Baltic Sea. Mapping and assessment of the geological hazard potential should be the main objectives of an integrated management program for the protection of coastal zones. This study documents the first step in that process for the Russian sector of the Baltic Sea and its coastal zone. A major part of endogenic hazard potential both in the Kaliningrad area and in the eastern Gulf of Finland remains at low- or medium-risk levels, but analysis of the recent environmental conditions at the seabed of the Russian sector of the Baltic Sea and, especially, within its coastal zone shows that during the last years the activity of exogenic geological processes has increased significantly. The highest risk within both studied areas has been caused by coastal and bottom erosion.

Here, we first illustrate how spatial variation in natural mortality may affect the population impact by considering a thought experiment. Second, we consider an empirically based example of Northeast Arctic cod to extend the concept to a realistic setting. Finally, we present a scenario-based investigation of how the degree of spatial variation in natural mortality affects the impact over a gradient of oil spill sizes. Including the effects of spatial variations in natural mortality tends to widen the impact distribution, hence increasing the probability of both high and low impact events. (C) 2017 The Authors.

Here we assess the role of these calcifying organisms in regulating the strength of the CCP in a Southern Ocean region (northern Scotia Sea) known to be a major hotspot for the draw-down of atmospheric CO2. We show that, when shelled pteropods dominate the calcifying community, the total annual reduction of CO2 transferred to the deep ocean doubles (17%) compared to when other plankton calcifiers dominate (3-9%). Furthermore, predation enhances their contribution through the removal of organic soft tissue. Pteropods are threatened in polar regions by ocean warming and acidification.

Methods used ranged from qualitative ones to monetary valuation and valuation methods were defined for each service. The most important services in the SPA are those related to water provision, quality and regulation. Regulation provides a reduction in the occurrence of floods and landslides (29 deaths and around is an element of 20,000,000 in damages, in 1997, in a village close to the SPA). This regulation of the water cycle also provides water worth more than is an element of 600,000. Other important services were: Genetic/species diversity maintenance; Carbon storage estimated at around 465,000 tC plus 223,667,84 tC/year sequestered in the peat area; Ecotourism and Recreation estimated at around is an element of 60,000/year plus 16,500/year expenses on active tourism activities and Landscape and amenity values estimated at is an element of 3,000,000 for the Povoacao region alone.

We outline past work on the public perceptions and acceptability of ocean-based CDR among laypersons covering the main developments over the past 15 years. We compare and synthesize insights from two distinct strands of literature - one on climate engineering approaches and the other on coastal ecosystem management or blue carbon approaches. We also draw conclusions from studies on land-based CDR for emerging ocean-based approaches. Main determinants of perceptions identified in the past are controllability, environmental impacts, containment, permanence of carbon storage, risks and benefits for the local population as well as to which degree an approach is perceived as natural or engineered. We highlight how these aspects may influence perceptions and acceptability of ocean-based CDR approaches which have not yet been on the agenda of perceptions research. Even though ocean-based CDR approaches cannot be neatly divided into categories, the public's tendency to favor approaches perceived more as natural over approaches perceived more as engineering could result in a dilemma between approaches with possibly high carbon sequestration potential but low levels of acceptability and approaches with possibly low sequestration potential but high levels of acceptability. To effectively work toward achieving net-zero carbon emissions by mid-century, however, we need to bridge the gap between natural and engineering-type approaches, also in research, to come up with a broad portfolio of CDR options to complement classic mitigation and adaptation measures.",,,,,,,,,22,1,0,0,4,0,24,,,,2624-9553,,,,,,,,,,"Kiel Inst World Econ, Res Ctr Global Commons & Climate Policy, Kiel, Germany",,,,2020-12-21,WOS:001023187300001,,

It offers analysis on simultaneous interlocking-segment line motions to solve three-dimensional dynamic responses of a multi-component mooring line. The model integrates hydrodynamic loads, line-seabed interaction, elasticity, current effect, and dragging anchor motions. It is then coupled with a ship-type floating offshore structure and validated by comparing with equivalent model based on a conventional numerical method. Comparison against two-dimensional model is also established. Finally, coupled motion analysis of the floating structure moored by multi-leg with multi-component mooring lines in realistic operations are conducted by considering actual environmental loads.

Red snapper were caught using rod and reel over nine artificial reef sites, with three reefs each located at 21-m, 27-m, and 32-m depths. During the study, 1,604 fish were tagged, and 174 recaptures were made of 167 individuals. On 4 October 1995, the eye of Hurricane Opal passed within 40 km of the artificial reef sites. When recaptures were stratified according to whether or not they were at liberty during Opal, storm effect was the most significant factor in predicting the likelihood of movement and magnitude of movement by tagged red snapper. Eighty percent of recaptured red snapper that were not at liberty during Opal were recaptured at their site of release. Fish that were at liberty during Opal, however, had a significantly higher likelihood of movement away from their site of release (P < 0.001). These fish also moved significantly further than those that were not at liberty during Opal (P < 0.001). Fish that were at liberty during Opal moved a mean distance (+- SE) of 32.6 km (+- 6.81), compared to a mean distance (+- SE) of 2.5 km (+- 1.10) for fish that were tagged and recaptured before Opal, and a mean distance (+- SE) of 1.7 km (+- 0.43) for fish that were tagged and recaptured after Opal. Heretofore, it has generally been accepted that adult red snapper demonstrate strong site fidelity and genetic homogeneity in the stock was hypothesized to result from larval drift or due to historic mixing on longer time scales.

Vegetation change in savannas has important implications for pastoral land-use, conservation management, and landscape-scale carbon storage, and informs theoretical debates about ecosystem function. This study seeks to determine the nature, extent and cause(s) of woody vegetation change in a seasonally flooded alluvial savanna habitat.Location The study area is located within the seasonally inundated alluvial zone of the tidal portion of the Victoria River, Northern Territory, Australia. The study area has been grazed by domestic stock since c. 1900, prior to which the area was inhabited and more likely regularly burnt by Aboriginal people for thousands of years.Methods Digital georeferenced aerial photographic coverages were used to examine and quantify woody vegetation change between 1948 and 1993. Transect surveys of woody and herbaceous vegetation were carried out to ground-truth air-photo results and determine the nature and causes of observed vegetation changes.Results There has been a dramatic increase in woody vegetation cover throughout the study area. Vegetation change patterns are roughly uniform across the full range of edaphic habitat variation and are unrelated to the depositional age of fluvial sediments. Two woody species, Eucalyptus microtheca and Excoecaria parvifolia, are predominantly responsible for observed increases. Demographic analyses reveal that woody invasions have been episodic and indicate that in most locations peak woody species establishment occurred in the mid-1970s. Grasses are almost absent in a majority of habitats within the study area. Instead, large areas are covered by scalded soil, dense invasive weed populations, and unpalatable forbs and sedges. What grasses do occur are predominantly of very low value for grazing. The condition of the herbaceous layer renders most of the study area almost completely non-flammable; what fires do burn are small and of low intensity.Main conclusions Multiple working hypotheses explaining observed patterns of woody vegetation increase were considered and rejected in turn. The only hypothesis consistent with the evidence is as follows: (1) observed changes are a direct consequence of extreme overgrazing by cattle, most likely when stocking rates peaked in the mid-1970s; (2) prolonged heavy grazing effected the complete transformation of much of the herbaceous vegetation to a new state that is not flammable; and (3) in the absence of regular fire mortality, woody vegetation increased rapidly. The relatively treeless system that existed in 1948 was apparently stable and resilient to moderate grazing levels, and perhaps also to episodic heavy grazing events. However, grazing intensity in excess of a sustainable threshold has forced a transition that is irreversible in the foreseeable future.

However, assessment of the condition of soil biota is hampered by an overwhelming level of diversity. With representatives in all trophic levels of the food web, nematode communities can be used as bioindicators. Accurate assessment of nematode assemblages requires insight into the distribution of specimens with distinct food preferences. With the availability of taxon-specific quantitative PCR assays, distribution patterns of multiple nematode groups can be investigated simultaneously. Here, microscale patchiness of 45 nematode taxa was studied on 12 sampling sites (each with four adjacent microplots) located on arable fields or semi-natural grasslands (system'), and on marine, river clay or sandy soils (soil type'). From each microplot, five composite samples were collected. Contrary to our expectations, an increase in the number of cores per composite sample did not result in more accurate measurements, and apparently the levels of microscale patchiness of the taxa are low compared to what has been reported for oligophagous plant-parasites. System and soil type did not affect microscale distribution. To investigate the level of patchiness in more detail, detection probability (DP) and variability of abundances were calculated. Common and widespread bacterivorous and fungivorous taxa had DP90%, confirming low level of microscale patchiness. With DPs of 40%-70%, predators and most omnivores showed degrees of local clustering. An overview of mean variabilities of abundances is presented that offers insight into how feeding preferences impact the microscale distribution both between and within trophic groups.",,,,,,,,,20,1,0,0,15,0,23,,,1755-098X,1755-0998,,,,,,,,,,"Wageningen Univ & Res Ctr WUR, Lab Nematol, Wageningen, NetherlandsWageningen Univ & Res Ctr WUR, Biometris, Wageningen, NetherlandsNatl Inst Publ Hlth & Environm RIVM, Bilthoven, NetherlandsSoilCares Res, Wageningen, Netherlands",SoilCares Res,,,2017-11-01,WOS:000415921900038,28323394,

This study was aimed to develop a prevention strategy to minimize damage and to ensure vulnerable natural resources and local community fisheries economic activities in coastal areas are protected. The local community utilizes fisheries resources in coastal waters of South Sumatera Province as their main livelihood. The potential of fish and shrimp resources in this area is quite abundant due to the existence of good mangrove ecosystems and located in the high-organic environment of Musi River estuary. On the other hand, the area is highly potential to be threatened by oil spill accident from the nearby of Bangka Strait just right in front of the Musi Estuary. A model named Environmental Sensitivity Index (ESI) has been developed to classify the level of sensitivities along the shoreline and habitats of the study area to protect such area. Environmental sensitivity index takes into account the vulnerability, biological and socio - economical characteristics for each coastal environmental feature such as fisheries resources and mangrove ecosystem. These three fundamental ESI elements are transferred into three indexes, i.e. Vulnerability Index, Ecological Index and Social Index. Spatial analysis through the geographic information system of overlay technique is applied to determine each environmental feature to produce ESI Map. The results of the ESI analysis show that coastal waters which are habitat of brackish water fishes and shrimps harvested by passive fishing gear such as Kelong (a combination of Guiding Barrier and Fixed lift net) and Sero (Guiding Barrier) are categorized as the sensitive category, while other offshore waters are classed as moderate level.

The Program approaches these challenges through integration of the technologies developed in the Advanced Storage component of the Program and field tested in the Storage Infrastructure component. The Carbon Storage Program is now well positioned to begin feasibility projects on commercial-scale saline storage complexes, building upon almost two decades of knowledge and experience gained from Storage Infrastructure field projects. An early key milestone was the implementation of the Regional Carbon Sequestration Partnership (RCSP) Initiative. Experience and knowledge gained from these field projects provide a firm foundation for future larger-scale field projects, either onshore or offshore. Perhaps most importantly, it is only by performing these field projects that the knowledge needed to identify additional subsurface reservoir and operational issues still requiring further research can be acquired.

Reconstruction of this shelf edge trajectory reveals the absence of a Lake Pannon level drop during this time; rather, deposition was done during a highstand systems tract. We divided the Serbian postrift sediments into the Hetin, Majdan, Mokrin, Kikinda, and Paludina Formations used by geoscientists in Hungary and Slovakia. Hemipelagic marls of the Hetin Formation serve as the source rocks for the Majdan Formation basin-center turbidite reservoirs. These turbidite reservoirs are in turn sealed by clays and marls of the Mokrin slope formation. In contrast to previous interpretations of this part of the basin, our new sequence stratigraphy interpretation of the depositional environment interpretation significantly reduces the miscorrelation of the target sandstone reservoirs.

To deal with these problems a low-cost prototype tool, named Wave-Brush, was developed, patented and tested for a short period of time on longlines positioned in an area of the Central Adriatic Sea protected by an artificial reef.The tool is mounted outside the traditional stack of oyster containers. Under the effect of sea currents and waves, it can freely and independently move around the external surface of the stackable containers. This results in the effective removal of biofouling without influencing the water flow inside the oyster trays. This device is applicable to many different types of underwater structure where a reduction of biofouling is required.Growth of the Pacific oyster spat, Crassostrea gigas (Thunberg, 1793), was studied over seven months. The oysters were cultured both in the traditional stacks and those treated by Wave-Brush.To test the effect of the Wave-Brush treatment on biomass of fouling taxa, a mixed-model permutational multivariate analysis of variance (PERMANOVA) was carried out. All test results from PERMANOVA analyses indicated unambiguously that faunal fouling assemblages on experimental containers were dissimilar to traditional ones even after few months. The Wave-Brush tool proved to be an easy, inexpensive and useful tool to improve performance and allow oyster culture in eutrophic waters. In particular, Wave-Brush substantially reduced the biofouling and mussel settlement on the oyster containers. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

The system will combine the aspirations and experience of Maori, communities, and industry with the evidence of scientific research to transform New Zealand into a world-leader in sustainable marine economic development. The Challenge will: Assess the cultural, economic and environmental values of our oceans and coasts; Investigate and describe the impacts of natural and human stresses on marine ecosystems; Identify options for environmental mitigation or restoration; and Overcome impediments to enhanced resource use.The science carried out as part of the Challenge will link with existing New Zealand marine research and build on collaborations with leading international science institutions. The goal is to develop the knowledge needed to manage the whole marine ecosystem, rather than separately manage the individual sectors, such as fisheries, oil and gas, mining and recreation. A key element of Sustainable Seas will be communicating with all sectors of society who are interested in the use and protection of the marine environment. This means that the research will focus on what society needs, and it will aim to increase the understanding and skills of the individual and communities concerned. The intention is that this enhanced public involvement will help restore Kaitiakitanga guardianship and protection of the environment and increase our understanding of what the marine estate means to us all.

We determined the structure of microbial populations inhabiting coastal saltmarsh sediments from northern Barataria Bay, Louisiana, USA to gain insight into impacts on the biogeochemical cycles affected by Macondo oil from the 2010 Deepwater Horizon well blowout two years after the accident. Quantitative PCR directed toward specific functional genes revealed that oiled marshes were greatly diminished in the population sizes of diazotrophs, denitrifiers, nitrate-reducers to ammonia, methanogens, sulfate-reducers and anaerobic aromatic degraders, and harbored elevated numbers of alkane-degraders. Illumina 16S rRNA gene sequencing indicated that oiling greatly changed the structure of the microbial communities, including significant decreases in diversity. Oil-driven changes were also demonstrated in the structure of two functional populations, denitrifying and sulfate reducing prokaryotes, using nirS and dsrB as biomarkers, respectively. Collectively, the results from I6S rRNA and functional genes indicated that oiling not only markedly altered the microbial community structures, but also the sizes and structures of populations involved in (or regulating) a number of important nutrient biogeochemical cycles in the saltmarshes. Alterations such as these are associated with potential deterioration of ecological services, and further studies are necessary to assess the trajectory of recovery of microbial-mediated ecosystem functions over time in oiled saltmarsh sediment.

Australia may be one of the few countries in this region that can afford to take adequate conservation measures in the near future. As it also has one of the longest Indian Ocean coastlines, Australia has the opportunity, and responsibility, to make a meaningful contribution to the conservation of Indian Ocean biodiversity. Threatened species, including marine turtles, inshore dolphins, and dugongs are an important component of that biodiversity. The dugong has been exterminated from several areas in the Indian Ocean, and it appears to be particularly threatened by mesh netting and hunting. its long-term survival may depend on adequate protection in Australia, which contains the largest known Indian Ocean populations. This protection will require, in part, an appropriate system of marine protected areas (MPAs). This paper examines the adequacy of MPAs along Australia's Indian Ocean coast. Dugongs occur in two MPAs in Western Australia. The proposed expansion of the system of marine reserves is based primarily on representative samples of ecosystems from each biogeographic region. It is inadequate because it does not take into account the distribution and relative abundance of threatened species. if the conservation of biodiversity is to be maximized, the system of MPAs should incorporate both representativeness and the needs of threatened species. The level of protection provided by MPAs in Western Australia is low.

Extreme Value Analysis (EVA) was used to characterize infrequent values from monitoring studies that are potentially associated with impact, defined as relevant biological change as a consequence of human activity, at a tidal energy site. EVA was adapted for monitoring aquatic organisms in the water column using an active acoustic dataset from Admiralty Inlet, a proposed tidal energy site. First derivatives were used to identify extreme value thresholds to improve precision of EVA parameters. Return level plots, which indicate the average period that extreme values are expected to appear, and uncertainty estimates of return level predictions, were generated using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulations.

More accurate hurricane forecasts would result in fewer false alarms, thereby preventing these unnecessary evacuations and disruptions in production. This study estimates the value of both existing and more accurate hurricane forecast information. A probabilistic cost - loss model is used to estimate the incremental value of hurricane forecast information for oil and gas leases in the Gulf of Mexico over the past two decades. Detailed computations of hurricane forecasting accuracy are performed using records from the National Hurricane Center and Marine Forecast/Advisory from 1980 to 2000. Evacuation costs and potential losses are estimated using data from the Minerals Management Service and oil company drilling records. Estimates indicate that the value of existing 48-h hurricane forecast information to oil and gas producers averaged roughly $8 million per year during the 1990s, which substantially exceeds the operating budget of the National Hurricane Center. From an industry perspective, however, these values are a small fraction of drilling and production costs. Moreover, although recent hurricane forecast accuracy is improving, it has not been sufficient to create significant value to this industry. On the other hand, forecast value dramatically increases with improvements in accuracy, rising by more than $15 million per year with a simulated 50% improvement in 48-h forecast accuracy.",,,,,,,,,24,0,0,0,1,0,27,,,0894-8763,,,,,,,,,,,"Penn State Univ, University Pk, PA 16801 USAInt Petr Associates Inc, Ashburn, VA USAUSN, Res Lab, Monterey, CA USA",Int Petr Associates Inc,,,2004-09-01,WOS:000223828700003,,

To this end, the project is focusing on technologies, algorithms and methods required for enabling the right level of autonomy and human machine interaction in IMR operations. This includes new perception, localization, path-planning, and shared control technologies, as well as new methods for risk management.

Accordingly, this legislation will drive the development and selection of offshore chemicals that have the lowest impact on the marine environment. A series of associated Recommendations provide guidance on how to compare the potential environmental impact of different chemicals. This involves the generation of an environmental data set (i.e. toxicity, persistence and bioaccumulation potential) and its evaluation using pre-screening criteria and a decision-support tool called CHARM (Chemical Hazard Assessment and Risk Management) Model.While the Decision provides a standardised framework, those countries having oil and gas operations in the Northeast Atlantic have implemented the requirements in different ways An account is given of the national schemes operating in the UK, Denmark, Norway and the Netherlands that focuses upon the involvement. of the chemical supplier.

Most of the carbon released by the terrestrial biosphere is stored in the ocean, where the light isotopic signature of terrestrial carbon is observed as a 0.32-0.7 parts per thousand depletion in benthic foraminiferal delta C-13. The wide range in estimated delta C-13 change results from the use of different subsets of benthic delta C-13 data and different methods of weighting the mean delta C-13 by volume. We present a more precise estimate of glacial-interglacial delta C-13 change of marine dissolved inorganic carbon using benthic Cibicidoides spp. delta C-13 records from 480 core sites (more than 3 times as many sites as previous studies). We divide the ocean into eight regions to generate linear regressions of regional delta C-13 versus depth for the Late Holocene (0-6 ka) and Last Glacial Maximum (19-23 ka) and estimate a mean delta C-13 decrease of 0.38 +/- 0.08 parts per thousand (2 sigma) for 0.5-5km. Estimating large uncertainty ranges for delta C-13 change in the top 0.5 km, below 5 km, and in the Southern Ocean, we calculate a whole-ocean change of 0.34 +/- 0.19 parts per thousand. This implies a terrestrial carbon change that is consistent with recent vegetation model estimates of 330-694 Gt C. Additionally, we find that a well-constrained surface ocean delta C-13 change is essential for narrowing the uncertainty range of estimated whole-ocean delta C-13 change.",,,,,,,,,84,1,0,0,9,0,91,,,0883-8305,1944-9186,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Dept Earth Sci, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA",,,,2014-06-01,WOS:000340661100006,,

Nominal usage of Sousa chinensis (Osbeck, 1765) has been retained as a pragmatic measure, although the species present in the region resembles Sousa plumbea (Cuvier, 1828). Little is known about the ecology of this species in the region. Most available information on S. chinensis in the region originates from the Sultanate of Oman, where this species is among the most commonly recorded cetaceans; however, there is no absolute measure of abundance for anywhere in the region and the status of the species is unknown. Distribution is described for the region to include much of the Arabian (Persian) Gulf, Arabian Sea, Gulf of Aden, and Red Sea, but notably excludes the Gulf of Oman. This discontinuous distribution suggests the possible presence of discrete populations within the region. Beach-cast/dead individuals represent nearly two-thirds of all records (n=303) of this species in Oman. Live sightings indicate unusually large group sizes (up to 100 individuals) in the Arabian Sea and Arabian Gulf. Occasional associations with Tursiops sp. and Delphinus capensis tropicalis were documented. Mating behavior and the presence of calves were recorded in the months of April and May, and calves were also reported in June, October, November, and December. Threats to humpback dolphins in the Arabian region include incidental capture in fishing nets, coastal and offshore development (e.g., land reclamation, dredging, port and harbor construction), pollution, boat traffic, oil and gas exploration (including seismic surveying), military exercises, and biotoxins associated with red tide events. Evidence for historic and current directed catches of S. chinensis is limited, but opportunistic hunting may occur. Intraspecific variation in cranial measurements of individuals from the Arabian Sea coast of Oman fall within relative values found in individuals from the Saudi Arabian Gulf coast. Cranial abnormalities were few. Recommendations are made for conservation management-oriented research focusing on stock identity and status assessments, as well as for monitoring of fisheries by-catch, clearer definition of other threats, continued specimen and sample collection, and training of local scientists.",,,,,,,,,36,5,0,0,40,0,44,,,0167-5427,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2004-01-01,BCI:BCI200400358422,,

To build on this effort locally, loss on ignition and elemental analyses were used to assess sediment organic matter, dry bulk density, and carbon density variability within the root zone of a mesohaline and oligohaline tidal marsh in Delaware. Additionally, we assessed sediment carbon variability at depth greater than one meter and quantified the black carbon fraction in the mesohaline tidal marsh. Organic matter concentrations ranged between 11.85 +/- 1.19% and 23.12 +/- 6.15% and sediment carbon density ranged from 0.03 +/- 0.01 g cm(-3) to 0.06 +/- 0.02 g cm(-3) with both found to significantly differ between the mesohaline and oligohaline tidal marsh systems. Significant differences between dominant vegetation types were also found. We used these data to further estimate and valuate the carbon stock at the mesohaline tidal marsh to be 350 +/- 310 metric tons of soil carbon accumulation per year with a social carbon value of $40,000 +/- $35,000. This work improves our knowledge of Delaware-specific carbon stocks, and it may further facilitate broad estimates of carbon storage in under-sampled areas, and thereby enable better quantification of economic and natural benefits of tidal wetland systems by land managers.",,,,,,,,,7,0,0,0,5,0,11,,,1400-0350,1874-7841,,,,,,,,,,"Delaware Dept Nat Resources & Environm Control, Div Climate Coastal & Energy, Dover, DE 19901 USADelaware Dept Nat Resources & Environm Control, Delaware Natl Estuarine Res Reserve, Dover, DE 19901 USAOhio State Univ, Sch Environm & Nat Resources, Columbus, OH 43210 USAHumboldt State Univ, Dept Oceanog, Coll Nat Resources & Sci, Arcata, CA 95521 USAUniv South Carolina, Sch Earth Ocean & Environm, Columbia, SC 29208 USA",Delaware Dept Nat Resources & Environm ControlDelaware Dept Nat Resources & Environm Control,,,2020-11-17,WOS:000583548800001,,

A fourth type of tidal energy system studied is a novel JPL/Caltech hydraulic energy transfer system that uses submerged turbine blades which are mechanically attached to adjacent high-pressure pumps, instead of to adjacent electrical turbines. The generated high-pressure water streams are combined and transferred to an onshore hydroelectric plant by means of a closed-cycle pipeline. The hydraulic energy transfer system was found to be cost competitive, and it allows all electronics to be placed onshore, thus greatly reducing maintenance costs and corrosion problems. It also eliminates the expenses of conditioning and transferring multiple offshore power lines and of building offshore platforms embedded in the sea floor.For time-dependent tidal energy, the pressurized hydraulic energy can be stored in an elevated onshore reservoir that can be used as per consumer energy demand, rather than as per tidal energy supply. This technology is a spinoff of a miniature ocean hydraulic energy transfer system that JPL is developing for the Office of Naval Research (ONR). The ONR device uses ocean temperature differences to provide pressurized hydraulic energy which supplies all electrical power for small submersibles. This type of hydraulic energy device is expected to allow submersibles to stay submerged for years. A three-month ocean endurance test is scheduled for late 2009.Similar types of hydraulic energy transfer systems are potentially applicable to all types of hydrokinetic energy, including free-flowing rivers, ocean wave energy, and energy from ocean currents, such as the Gulf Stream. In each case, the corrosion-prone, submerged electrical turbines are replaced by all-mechanical water pumps without any electrical components, and the energy is hydraulically transferred to remote onshore hydroelectric plants by inexpensive pipes.The submerged mechanical turbine blade/pump assemblies can be attached by long, small-diameter, flexible pressurized lines to the larger submerged, stationary pipe lines, thus allowing the submerged blade/pump assemblies to be lifted to the surface and serviced by boat. Check valves in the flexible lines allow damaged turbine blade/pump assemblies to be automatically taken off-line and later repaired or replaced as required.",,,,,"28th International Conference on Ocean, Offshore and Arctic Engineering28th International Conference on Ocean, Offshore and Arctic Engineering","MAY 31-JUN 05, 2009MAY 31-JUN 05, 2009","ASME, Ocean, Offshore & Arctic Engn DivASME, Ocean, Offshore & Arctic Engn Div","Honolulu, HIHonolulu, HI",1,0,0,0,0,0,1,,,,,978-0-7918-4344-4,,,,,,,,,"CALTECH, Jet Prop Lab, Mech Syst Div, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA",,,,2009-01-01,WOS:000286404300114,,

Typically, the CO2 has to be separated from the natural gas (NG) in offshore processing facilities (in situ) before the NG can be sent for processing at the gas plant onshore. To date, commercial-scale CO2 capture and storage (CCS) has proven to be viable mainly for CO2 that is separated from NG and subsequently injected at or near the gas field itself for permanent storage (CO2 sequestration) or utilized for the purpose of Enhanced Oil Recovery (EOR). In the case of multiple adjacent reservoirs exhibiting variations in NG quality and CO2 content, it may be necessary to have in situ CO2 removal using NG sweetening processes (e.g. membrane or amine absorption) to achieve a quality level such that the pooled NG streams meets the sales gas specification required for further processing at an onshore facility for sales. In this work, new process integration approaches are proposed to aid in the integrated planning of such joint field development projects, to rationalize the development of contaminated gas fields together with conventional sweet gas fields in meeting the required sales gas specifications of CO2 content. These approaches are based on analogous techniques previously developed for distributed effluent treatment systems and carbon capture planning for the power generation sector. A case study is used to illustrate how general insight-based policies for gas field development can be drawn from process integration perspectives. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

In this paper, the sea surface current velocity, surface wind velocity, wave height and wave period are taken as the evaluation factors of marine environment. The fleet angle at riser top section, the Mises equivalent stress on riser critical section, the axial dynamic load on riser bottom section and the riser transverse resonance are considered as the limiting factors which restrains the further complicacy of marine environment. Results show that the wave height and wave period mainly affect the lateral vibration frequency and the dynamic load. The sea surface wind velocity and sea surface current velocity determines the fleet angle and the Mises equivalent stress. However, compared with the fleet angle, the maximum equivalent stress is the main influence factor which limits the installation operation window. In general, under the circumstance of avoiding transverse resonance, smaller wave height and longer wave period are good for marine riser installation. The research has some reference value for safe and effective installation of marine riser. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

This area has experienced pronounced reduction in the extent of summer sea ice over the last decade, as well as increased anthropogenic activity, particularly in the form of oil and gas exploration. The effects of these changes on marine mammal species are presently unknown. Autonomous passive acoustic recorders were deployed over a wide area of the northeastern Chukchi Sea off the coast of Alaska from Cape Lisburne to Barrow, at distances from 8 km to 200 km from shore: up to 44 each summer and up to 8 each winter. Acoustic data were acquired at 16 kHz continuously during summer and on a duty cycle of 40 or 48 min within each 4-h period during winter. Recordings were analyzed manually and using automated detection and classification systems to identify calls.Bowhead (Balaena mysticetus) and beluga (Delphinapterus leucas) whale calls were detected primarily from April through June and from September to December during their migrations between the Bering and Beaufort seas. Summer detections were rare and usually concentrated off Wainwright and Barrow, Alaska. Gray (Eschrichtius robustus) whale calls were detected between July and October, their occurrence decreasing with increasing distance from shore. Fin (Balaenoptera physalus), killer (Orcinus orca), minke (Balaenoptera acutorostrata), and humpback (Megaptera novaeangliae) whales were detected sporadically in summer and early fall. Walrus (Odobenus rosmarus) was the most commonly detected species between June and October, primarily occupying the southern edge of Hanna Shoal and haul-outs near coastal recording stations off Wainwright and Point Lay. Ringed (Pusa hispida) and bearded (Erignathus barbatus) seals occur year-round in the Chukchi Sea. Ringed seal acoustic detections occurred throughout the year but detection numbers were low, likely due to low vocalization rates. Bearded seal acoustic detections peaked in April and May during their breeding season, with much lower detection numbers in July and August, likely as a result of reduced calling rates after breeding season. Ribbon seals (Histriophoca fasciata) were only detected in the fall as they migrated south through the study area toward the Bering Sea. These results suggest a regular presence of marine mammals in the Chukchi Sea year-round, with species-dependent seasonal and spatial density variations. (C) 2013 The Authors.

Monitoring reports on oil mist and oil vapour exposure covered 37 drilling facilities. Exposure data were analysed using descriptive statistics and by constructing linear mixed-effects models.Results: Samples had been taken during the use of three generations of hydrocarbon base oils, namely diesel oils (1979-1984), low-aromatic mineral oils (1985-1997) and non-aromatic mineral oils (1998-2004). Sampling done before 1984 showed high exposure to diesel vapour (arithmetic mean, AM = 1217 mg m(-3)). When low-aromatic mineral oils were used, the exposure to oil mist and oil vapour was 4.3 and 36 mg m(-3), and the respective AMs for non-aromatic mineral oils were reduced to 0.54 and 16 mg m(-3). Downward time trends were indicated for both oil mist (6% per year) and oil vapour (8% per year) when the year of monitoring was introduced as a fixed effect in a linear mixed-effects model analysis.

At the same time, the grid code requirements of the Transmission System Operators (TSO), including ancillary system services and Low-Voltage Fault-Ride-Through (LVFRT) capability of large offshore windfarms, become more demanding. This paper presents a general-level model of and a LVFRT solution for a VSC-HVDC system for grid-connection of large offshore windfarms. The VSC-HVDC model is implemented using a general approach of independent control of active and reactive power in normal operation situations. The on-land VSC inverter, which is also called a grid-side inverter, provides voltage support to the transmission system and comprises a LVFRT solution in short-circuit faults. The presented model, LVFRT solution and impact on the system stability are investigated as a case study of a 1,000 MW offshore windfarm grid-connected through four parallel VSC-HVDC systems each with a 280 MVA power rating. The investigation is carried out on a complete, validated model of the west Danish, with some elements of the north German, 400 kV, 220 kV and 150 kV transmission systems stage 2005-2006 using the DIgSILENT PowerFactory simulation program. The use of such a complete, validated power system model is among novelties of this work on utilization of VSC-HVDC systems for grid-connection of large offshore windfarms. In the investigation, a thermal power plant just south to the Danish border has been substituted by the 1,000 MW offshore windfarm with the VSC-HVDC system. The investigation has shown that the substitution of a thermal power plant by a VSC-HVDC connected large offshore windfarm should not have any negative impact on the short-term stability of the west Danish transmission system.

The history of a company engaged in the offshore oil and gas industry exemplifies the points: Hitec started out as a small company with limited financial resources, but over a 10-year period, its innovations and improvements radically transformed offshore oil and gas drilling operations. An evolutionary methodological approach is balanced by theoretically informed analysis. A main finding is that customer-supplier interaction was crucial. Hitec's success, crowned by its eventual acquisition by American capital, can be attributed in part to the know-how and technology provided by one of its suppliers and partners during the early phase.

This analysis will aim to evaluate the effects of applying a broad but realistic range of reservoir, fault and gas chimney properties on potential CO2 leakage at various depths throughout the subsurface. Fluid flow might take place through parts of or the entire extent of the overburden. One of the aims of the analysis is assessing the potential of CO2 reaching the seabed. Using the Snohvit gas reservoir and overburden in the Barents Sea, a series of geological models were built using seismic and well-log data. We then performed numerical simulations of CO2 migration in focused fluid flow structures. Identification of potential migration pathways and their extent, such as gas chimneys and faults, and their incorporation into these models and simulations will provide a realistic insight into the migration potential of CO2. In the simulations the CO2 is injected over a 20 year period at a rate of 0.7 Mt/year and migration is allowed to take place over a 2000 year time frame for domains of approximately 21 km(2) for the caprock fault models, 24 km(2) for the realistic gas chimney models and 35 km(2) for the generic gas chimney models, in a layered sedimentary succession. The total mass of CO2 injected in the reservoir during the 20-year injection period is 14 Mt. There is a strong interaction between the various parameters but the parameter that had the most influence on the CO2 migration process was probably the permeability of the reservoirs, especially the average permeability (k). Also, for the faulted caprock scenarios, it should be noted that at near surface depths the permeability of 765 mD is already adequate for a good CO2 flow. At the chimney top level (600 m) however, a further increase in permeability has an additional effect on improving CO2 flow. Overall, considering the slow upward migration velocity of the plume, this geological setup can be regarded as a suitable storage site.",,,,,,,,,7,0,0,0,0,0,7,,,1866-6280,1866-6299,,,,,,,,,,"UiT Arctic Univ Norway, Dept Geol, CAGE Ctr Arctic Gas Hydrate Environm & Climate, Tromso, NorwayUniv Stuttgart, Dept Hydromech & Modeling Hydrosyst, D-70174 Stuttgart, Germany",,,,2016-04-13,WOS:000372251000055,,

Here, Life Cycle Assessment is applied to evaluate environmental loads in the whole life cycle of the deep-sea oil and gas production. This paper explores the carbon footprint of Floating Production Storage and Offloading as the time axis. It is found that Floating Production Storage and Offloading is a conceptual product at the design stage and does not generate carbon emission, while the operational stage releases considerable emission by the fuel combustion process, accounting for 88.2% of the entire life cycle. To decrease this part of carbon emission, distributed energy system is considered as a promising choice because it integrates different energy resources and provides an economic and environmental energy allocation scheme to meet the energy demand. For the operation stage, this paper establishes a Multi-objective Mathematical Programming model to determine the selection and capacity of facilities with minimum annual total cost and carbon emissions by considering the energy balance and technical constraints. The model is validated by an example and solved by the weight method. According to designer's demand, distributed energy system can optimize economic objectives in a maximum range of 14.6%, and a maximum emission reduction of 4.53% can be expected compared with the traditional scheme.

Baseline exposure data can inform future monitoring of avian population health, and provide a metric for evaluating the success of remediation efforts, should they occur. Identification of sensitive species and populations can inform resource management, risk assessment of new development activities, and development of long-term monitoring strategies. We evaluated baselines of hydrocarbon exposure in select avian species of subsistence importance (king eider, common eider, and greater white-fronted goose) in the Chukchi and Beaufort Seas by measuring liver cytochrome P450 (CYP1A) activity. Results from this study provide the first assessment of baselines for hydrocarbon exposure in these species and form a basis for development of field programs for monitoring exposure levels in marine birds in the Chukchi and Beaufort Sea region. We also evaluated sensitivity to hydrocarbons in a broader suite of marine bird species using species-specific cell culture methods. These species offer a spectrum of candidate bioindicators of conservation and subsistence importance and included spectacled eider, Steller's eider, king eider, common eider, long-tailed duck, greater white-fronted goose, black brant, and three species of alcids.

Historic records tell of rats rafting to the southern island of Suouroy in 1768 following a shipwreck off the coast of Scotland, then expanding across the archipelago. We investigated the demographic history of brown rats in the Faroes using 50,174 SNPs. We inferred three independent introductions of rats, including to Suouroy, the islands of Borooy and Viooy, and onto Streymoy from which they expanded to Eysturoy and Vagar. All Faroese populations showed signs of strong bottlenecks and declining effective population size. We inferred that these founder events removed low frequency alleles, the exact data needed to estimate recent demographic histories. Therefore, we were unable to accurately estimate the timing of each invasion. The difficulties with demographic inference may be applicable to other invasive species, particularly those with extreme and recent bottlenecks.

Given this, numerous research projects have sought to extend the viability of clay three-dimensional digital fabrication by streamlining and automating workflows through computational methods and robotic technologies in ways that afford agency to the digital and machinic processes over human bodily skill. Three-dimensional printed clay has also gained prominence as a resilient material well suited to the design and fabrication of artificial reef and habitat-enhancing seawall structures for coastal marine environments depleted and disrupted by human activity, climate change and pollution. Still, these projects face similar challenges when three-dimensional printing complex forms from the highly plastic and somewhat unpredictable feed material of clay. In response, this article outlines a research project that seeks to improve the translation of complex geometries into physical clay artefacts through additive three-dimensional printing processes by drawing on the notion of digital craft and giving focus to human-machine interaction as a collaborative practice. Through the case study of the 1:1 scale fabrication of a computationally generated bio-reef structure using clay as a feed material and a readily available Delta Potterbot XLS-2 ceramic printer, the research project documents how, by exploiting the human ability to intuitively handle clay and adapt, and the machine's ability to work efficiently and with precision, humans and machines can fabricate together.

From 1848 to 1914 the stock was also exploited by commercial whalers. The bowhead is now widely recognized as an endangered species, and it is hunted today only by residents of certain coastal settlements in Alaska [USA]. The Alaska hunt is managed within a catch quota set by the International Whaling Commission (IWC). Canada is no longer a member of the IWC and thus has no direct role in the management of this whale fishery. However, the bowhead stock's main summer feeding grounds are in the eastern Beaufort Sea and Amundsen Gulf; activities associated with the exploration for and development of oil and gas in the western Canadian Arctic could have a serious impact on summering bowheads; and coastal residents of the western Canadian Arctic have expressed an interest in hunting these whales. Estimates of initial and current population size suggest that the Bering Sea stock is reduced to about 19-28 per cent of its level in 1848. Most life-history parameters for the bowhead are poorly known, and there is reason to question whether stock size will increase substantially under the existing harvest regime. Because of scientific uncertainties, continued hunting, and possible adverse effects of industrial activity, this stock should continue to be listed as endangered by the Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada (COSEWIC).",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,0077-2542,,,,,,,,,,,"ARCTIC BIOLOGICAL STATION, DEPARTMENT OF FISHERIES AND OCEANS, SAINTE-ANNE-DE-BELLEVUE, QUEBEC H9X 3R4, CANADA",,,,1986-01-01,BCI:BCI198783012454,,

We estimate North Pacific albacore consumed each year, on average, 54,000 mt of decapods and euphausiids, 43,000 mt of cephalopods, 84,000 mt of juvenile hake, 1600 mt of myctophids, 21,000 mt of juvenile sardine, 10,000 mt of juvenile rockfishes, almost 43,000 mt of Pacific saury, and over 107,000 nit of juvenile anchovy. While variability in predation certainly exists, this and prior studies show that diet habits of albacore are fairly stable through time. The northern CCS appears to be a more significant source of energy for albacore. When designing ecosystem-based approaches to the management of CCS-based fisheries, we recommend that the forage contribution of saury, hake and anchovy to the albacore population be considered.

Located within the central California Current System (CCS), Monterey Bay is strongly influenced by cycles of upwelling-favorable winds and their relaxation or reversal. Both dinoflagellate-dominated periods were linked to a negative North Pacific Gyre Oscillation (NPGO) and increased river discharge, but each had a different relationship with upwelling. To examine the connection between large-scale and local forcings underlying floristic shifts in the phytoplankton assemblage, an Imaging FlowCytobot (IFCB) was deployed within the Monterey Bay upwelling shadow for a full year. A machine learning classifier differentiating IFCB images of the phytoplankton assemblage was developed. Despite anomalously strong upwelling in 2018, dinoflagellates comprised 57% of the annual phytoplankton-specific biomass. During upwelling, dinoflagellates appear to have accumulated at convergent fronts, while during relaxation these frontal populations were transported to the nearshore where they seeded local blooms. Frequent upwelling-relaxation cycles and local wind anomalies generated an unusually retentive circulation pattern in the upwelling shadow, producing a warm and stratified bloom incubator. Thus, local features and forcings (upwelling shadow, winds, river discharge) modified the effects of regional- and basin-scale oceanographic variability (regional upwelling, NPGO), altering local phytoplankton patterns. As North Pacific decadal variability and CCS upwelling intensity increase under climate warming, dinoflagellates may become more common in some CCS regions, due to the enhancement or mitigation of large-scale trends by local forcings.",,,,,,,,,28,0,0,0,20,0,34,,,0024-3590,1939-5590,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Ocean Sci Dept, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA",,,,2020-04-07,WOS:000521606500001,,

However, such knowledge is not always available, sufficient, or even identifiable. The seabob-shrimp small-scale fisheries in the shallow waters of the State of Sao Paulo, in Southeastern Brazil, plays an important role in coastal livelihoods, providing social and economic benefits for a number of local communities and a premium source of regional seafood. Around 4000 fish-workers produce supplies for restaurants, fishmongers and supermarkets in coastal towns with about 2 million inhabitants. Nevertheless, harbor and naval mooring, the construction of pipelines, sewage disposal, controversial seasonal closures, and marine spatial zoning have all restricted the activity. A territorial approach is here proposed to examine the timeline of vertically implemented laws/regulations that may have resulted in a decrease of territories formerly available to that fisheries, accompanied by a comprehensive outlook of the overall policy context. The shrinkage of fishing territories has been evidenced and the kind of territorial loss detected does not seem to be implicit in cost analysis of fisheries, ecosystem services, or compensation. Top-down policies and a misunderstanding of environmental mitigation programs appear to have been contributing to increasing conflicts, mining multi-stakeholder processes and social justice in contrast to the ascendant economic growth of both the oil and gas and port industries. While economic and political pressures seem to shape current fishing territories, the recognition of the diversity of interests and power asymmetries in coastal zones directs our attention to a vital, often ignored, dimension of social reality.

We sampled individuals at 33 sites in 2012 to establish a baseline of genetic diversity and hierarchal population genetic structure and then assessed interannual variability in our estimates by sampling again in 2014. Genetic diversity showed little variation among sites or across years. In 2012, we observed weak genetic differentiation among sites (F-ST range = -0.005-0.014) following a pattern of isolation by distance (IBD) and significantly high relatedness among individuals within nine sampling sites. In 2014, pairwise F-ST estimates were lower (F-ST range = -0.014-0.007), there was no spatial autocorrelation, and fewer sites had significant evidence of relatedness. Based on these findings, we propose that interannual variation in the physical oceanographic conditions of the CCS influences larval recruitment and thus gene flow, contributing to interannual variation in population genetic structure. Estimates of effective population size (N-e) were large in both 2012 and 2014. Together, our results suggest that Dungeness crab in the CCS may constitute a single evolutionary population, although geographically limited dispersal results in an ephemeral signal of IBD. Furthermore, our findings demonstrate that populations of marine organisms may be susceptible to temporal changes in population genetic structure over short time periods; thus, interannual variability in population genetic measures should be considered.",,,,,,,,,16,0,0,0,14,0,18,,,0962-1083,1365-294X,,,,,,,,,,"Alaska Dept Fish & Game, Div Commercial Fisheries, Kodiak, AK 99615 USAOregon State Univ, Hatfield Marine Sci Ctr, Coastal Oregon Marine Expt Stn, Dept Fisheries & Wildlife, Newport, OR 97365 USANOAA Fisheries, Point Adams Res Stn, Hammond, OR USA",,,,2018-01-01,WOS:000428069400004,29193425,

Therefore, a CO2 injection method that can both improve the CSC and reduce the CAPEX is needed.This paper proposes a dual-tubing CO2 injection-water production horizontal well (DTHW) pattern for improving the CSC, in which CO2 is injected at the heel of the horizontal well while water is produced at the toe.

The proposed DTHW pattern showed promising results in that the maximum CSC was improved by 98.2% compared to a single vertical CO2 injection well pattern and the CAPEX was reduced by 37.1% compared to the typical CO2 injection with a water production pattern.

Many nations have blanket regulations requiring obsolete structures to be removed, yet this option is unlikely to yield optimal environmental, societal and economic outcomes in all situations. We propose that nations adopt a flexible approach that allows decommissioning options to be selected from the full range of alternatives (including 'rigs-to-reefs' options) on a case-by-case basis. We outline a method of multi-criteria decision analysis (Multi-criteria Approval, MA) for evaluating and comparing alternative decommissioning options across key selection criteria, including environmental, financial, socioeconomic, and health and safety considerations. The MA approach structures the decision problem, forces explicit consideration of trade-offs and directly involves stakeholder groups in the decision process. We identify major decommissioning options and provide a generic list of selection criteria for inclusion in the MA decision process. To deal with knowledge gaps concerning environmental impacts of decommissioning, we suggest that expert opinion feed into the MA approach until sufficient data become available. We conducted a limited trial of the MA decision approach to demonstrate its application to a complex and controversial decommissioning scenario; Platform Grace in southern California. The approach indicated, for this example, that the option 'leave in place intact' would likely provide best environmental outcomes in the event of future decommissioning. In summary, the MA approach will allow the environmental, social, and economic impacts of decommissioning decisions to be assessed simultaneously in a transparent manner. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

These emission factors (ranging from 1 times 10-6 to 8.05 pounds of total hydrocarbon per day per component) are utilized together with an inventory of the components and the OVA screening value for each component to estimate total platform fugitive hydrocarbon emission rates. For the seven platforms included in this study, the total platform emission rates ranged from 42 to 140 pounds of hydrocarbon per day with more than 70 percent of the emissions due to a very small number of large emitters. The average platform non-methane emission rate was 20 pounds per day.

Historically, Xiaohai Inlet had two openings, located at the north and south of Neizhi Island (a rocky outcrop), respectively. The evolution of Xiaohai Inlet was dominated by the natural process before 1972. In addition to the natural process, human interventions, including the closure of the north opening, 50% of freshwater reduction, and increase of land reclamation, have altered tidal hydrodynamics and morphological evolution since 1972. A series of numerical model simulations were conducted to investigate the influence of morphological changes on the hydrodynamics and the influence of human activities on the inlet evolution. The natural process has caused narrowing and shoaling of the inlet throat, development of Lie flood-tidal delta, and shoaling of the tidal channel inside the lagoon. Human interventions have accelerated these changes. Consequently, the tidal propagation from the offshore into the lagoon has been impeded and the tidal energy has been dissipated substantially. Tidal current has changed from ebb-dominant to flood-dominant in most parts of the inlet system whereas the inlet throat has remained as ebb-dominant, the tidal prism has decreased consistently, and sediment has continued to deposit inside the inlet. As a result, the changes of morphology, hydrodynamics, and sediment transport show a positive feedback. The human interventions have had both advantageous and adverse influences on the stability of the inlet. The closure of the North Opening has decreased the longshore sediment input to the inlet, and increased the tidal prism, ebb velocity, and sediment transport in the south opening, thus enhancing the inlet's stability. However, reducing the river discharge and landfill of the tidal flats has resulted in a decrease of the tidal prism, the ebb velocity, and the ability to export sediment, thus having the tendency to deteriorate the inlet's stability. A stability analysis based on a closure curve methodology has shown that Xiaohai Inlet is in a state of dynamic equilibrium at present.",,,,,,,,,5,2,0,0,0,0,6,,,0253-505X,1869-1099,,,,,,,,,,"Sun Yat Sen Univ, Sch Marine Sci, Guangzhou 510275, Guangdong, Peoples R ChinaVirginia Inst Marine Sci, Coll William & Mary, Gloucester Point, VA 23062 USAState Ocean Adm, Inst Oceanog 2, Key Lab Submarine Geosci, Hangzhou 310012, Zhejiang, Peoples R China",State Ocean Adm,,,2009-01-01,WOS:000268603100012,,

Large-scale damage of these forests, caused by hurricanes or clear felling, can enhance vulnerability to erosion, subsidence and rapid carbon losses. However, it is unclear how small-scale logging might impact on mangrove functions and services. We experimentally investigated the impact of small-scale tree removal on surface elevation and carbon dynamics in a mangrove forest at Gazi bay, Kenya. The trees in five plots of a Rhizophora mucronata (Lam.) forest were first girdled and then cut. Another set of five plots at the same site served as controls. Treatment induced significant, rapid subsidence (-32.1 +/- 8.4 mm yr(-1) compared with surface elevation changes of +4.2 +/- 1.4 mm yr(-1) in controls). Subsidence in treated plots was likely due to collapse and decomposition of dying roots and sediment compaction as evidenced from increased sediment bulk density. Sediment effluxes of CO2 and CH4 increased significantly, especially their heterotrophic component, suggesting enhanced organic matter decomposition. Estimates of total excess fluxes from treated compared with control plots were 25.3 +/- 7.4 tCO(2) ha(-1) yr(-1) (using surface carbon efflux) and 35.6 +/- 76.9 tCO(2) ha(-1) yr(-1) (using surface elevation losses and sediment properties). Whilst such losses might not be permanent (provided cut areas recover), observed rapid subsidence and enhanced decomposition of soil sediment organic matter caused by small-scale harvesting offers important lessons for mangrove management. In particular mangrove managers need to carefully consider the trade-offs between extracting mangrove wood and losing other mangrove services, particularly shoreline stabilization, coastal protection and carbon storage.",,,,,,,,,77,0,0,0,58,1,82,,,1932-6203,,,,,,,,,,,"Kenya Marine & Fisheries Res Inst, Mombasa, KenyaEdinburgh Napier Univ, Sch Life Sport & Social Sci, Edinburgh, Midlothian, ScotlandUniv Edinburgh, Sch Geosci, Edinburgh, Midlothian, ScotlandKatholieke Univ Leuven, Dept Earth & Environm Sci, Leuven, BelgiumBangor Univ, Sch Ocean Sci, Menai Bridge, Gwynedd, WalesUniv Glasgow, Sch Geog & Earth Sci, Glasgow, South Lanarkshi, ScotlandUniv Autonoma Barcelona, Ctr Ecol Res & Forestry Applicat, E-08193 Barcelona, Spain",Kenya Marine & Fisheries Res Inst,,,2014-09-22,WOS:000343679800053,25244646,

The aim of this review was to: (i) clarify the direct and indirect effects of N-r deposition on forest and lake food webs in N-limited biomes, (ii) compare and contrast how aquatic and terrestrial systems respond to increased N-r deposition, and (iii) identify how the nutrient pathways within and between ecosystems change in response to N-r deposition. We present that N-r deposition releases primary producers from N limitation in both forest and lake ecosystems and raises plants' N content which in turn benefits herbivores with high N requirements. Such trophic effects are coupled with a general decrease in biodiversity caused by different N-use efficiencies; slow-growing species with low rates of N turnover are replaced by fast-growing species with high rates of N turnover. In contrast, N-r deposition diminishes below-ground production in forests, due to a range of mechanisms that reduce microbial biomass, and decreases lake benthic productivity by switching herbivore growth from N to phosphorus (P) limitation, and by intensifying P limitation of benthic fish. The flow of nutrients between ecosystems is expected to change with increasing N-r deposition. Due to higher litter production and more intense precipitation, more terrestrial matter will enter lakes. This will benefit bacteria and will in turn boost the microbial food web. Additionally, N-r deposition promotes emergent insects, which subsidize the terrestrial food web as prey for insectivores or by dying and decomposing on land. So far, most studies have examined N-r-deposition effects on the food web base, whereas our review highlights that changes at the base of food webs substantially impact higher trophic levels and therefore food web structure and functioning.",,,,,,,,,90,8,0,0,71,0,103,,,1354-1013,1365-2486,,,,,,,,,,"Umea Univ, Dept Ecol & Environm Sci, S-90187 Umea, SwedenSwedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Forest Ecol & Management, S-90183 Umea, Sweden",,,,2016-01-01,WOS:000367982900012,25953197,

This paper aims at exploring to what extent current SEA processes for the oil and gas contribute, procedurally and substantively, to more strategic and sustainability-oriented decisions. To this purpose, we developed a framework for reviewing SEA reports, based on the strategic thinking model for SEA. The framework covers focal elements for enhancing SEA practice and it is structured into nine assessment parameters (object of assessment, entry point, interactivity, scope of assessment, strategic reference framework, process, participation, findings/outcomes, proposal for follow-up), and corresponding key questions. The framework was used to review 11 SEA reports related to both offshore and onshore oil and gas developments. The case studies are in different geographical contexts, and reflect examples of the broad range of SEA procedures existing worldwide. Our review provided evidences of those SEA aspects that play a crucial role in order to recognise more targeted and strategic information on which analysis should be based. This can provide substantive insights to improve the quality of SEA reports, as well as to better design more sustainability-oriented outcomes in the oil and gas sector.

Further, we found biological sequestration of CO2 taking place in the highly productive Changjiang river plume in warm seasons due to the riverine nutrient enrichment. Consequently, changes in the plume area due to changes in the Changjiang River Discharge (referred to as the Discharge hereafter) strongly affect the CO2 uptake capacity.

We tested the assumptions of a key step in QFASA, the correction of predator FA signatures for metabolic processes through sets of calibration coefficients (CCs). We conducted long-term controlled feeding studies with captive Steller sea lions consuming herring and eulachon and northern fur seals consuming herring. We compared the results with data from harbour seals eating herring to evaluate the effects of phylogeny and prey type on individual CCs. Even within the limited extended dietary FA subset recommended for use by other researchers, we found that at least 41% of the CCs differed by family (otariid vs. phocid seals) and 58% differed by predator species (sea lion vs. fur seal), suggesting that CCs may be highly species-specific. We also found that 64% of the CCs differed by prey type (sea lions consuming herring vs. eulachon), which raises some fundamental implementation issues. We also found significant differences in diet predictions when the herring-and eulachon-derived sets of CCs were applied to an actual multi-species diet. CCs are presently used as a simple mathematical attempt to describe potentially complex biochemistry.

Long-term carbon storage in coastal wetlands occurs primarily belowground as soil organic matter (SOM). In addition to serving as a carbon sink, SOM influences wetland ecosystem structure, function, and stability. To anticipate and mitigate the effects of climate change, there is a need to advance understanding of environmental controls on wetland SOM. Here, we investigated the influence of four soil formation factors: climate, biota, parent materials, and topography. Along the northern Gulf of Mexico, we collected wetland plant and soil data across elevation and zonation gradients within 10 estuaries that span broad temperature and precipitation gradients. Our results highlight the importance of climate-plant controls and indicate that the influence of elevation is scale and location dependent. Coastal wetland plants are sensitive to climate change; small changes in temperature or precipitation can transform coastal wetland plant communities. Across the region, SOM was greatest in mangrove forests and in salt marshes dominated by graminoid plants. SOM was lower in salt flats that lacked vascular plants and in salt marshes dominated by succulent plants. We quantified strong relationships between precipitation, salinity, plant productivity, and SOM. Low precipitation leads to high salinity, which limits plant productivity and appears to constrain SOM accumulation. Our analyses use data from the Gulf of Mexico, but our results can be related to coastal wetlands across the globe and provide a foundation for predicting the ecological effects of future reductions in precipitation and freshwater availability.

It is hard to obtain the answer unless the national risk level of the offshore petroleum industry is monitored and measured. This paper describes an effort to propose and discuss an analytical approach for the development of major hazard risk indicators that can be used for monitoring, measuring and predicting national risk levels in the offshore petroleum industry. This study focuses on major hazards on offshore installations, hence personal safety hazards that affect individuals are not covered. Firstly, a risk-based approach for developing major hazard risk indicators on offshore installations is developed. Both leading and lagging major hazard risk indicators on offshore installations are suggested. After that, the proposed analytical approach is tested by the risk assessment results of the Norwegian Continental Shelf (NCS) in the latest ten years (2007-2017). This is followed by a discussion on suitability and challenges of the proposed risk-based approach. It has been demonstrated that the results of this study can provide a realistic and jointly agreed major hazard risk picture in the offshore petroleum industry.

A real challenge will be quantification of the probability of a given monitoring program to detect a leak and to design the program accordingly. The task complicates by the number of pathways to the surface, difficulties to estimate probabilities of leaks and fluxes, and predicting the fluctuating footprint of a leak. The objective is to present a procedure for optimizing the layout of a fixed array of chemical sensors on the seafloor, using the probability of detecting a leak as metric. A synthetic map from the North Sea is used as a basis for probable leakage points, while the spatial footprint is based on results from a General Circulation Model. Compared to an equally spaced array the probability of detecting a leak can be nearly doubled by an optimal placement of the available sensors. It is not necessarily best to place the first in the location of the highest probable leakage point, one sensor can monitor several potential leakage points. The need for a thorough baseline in order to reduce the detection threshold is shown. (C) 2015 The Authors.

Most current methodologies are at least partially subjective; thus, having a means of objectively assigning fates would improve the precision, accuracy, and utility of such studies. We released 57 acoustically tagged fish belonging to six deepwater grouper species off North Carolina, USA, via surface release and recompressed release with descender devices. We applied a three-state hidden Markov model (HMM) in a novel way: to distinguish movement patterns between fish that were alive and fish that were dead (and might have been eaten by predators). We assigned fates using two approaches that differed in their reliance on HMMs. When HMMs were the predominant source of fate assignment, we estimated survival of 40 deepwater groupers released with descender devices at the continental shelf break (66-120-m depth) to be 0.46 (95% CI = 0.33-0.65). When a combination of HMMs and prior information was utilized, we estimated survival of the same 40 groupers to be 0.61 (95% CI = 0.47-0.80). Both estimates represented a substantial improvement over the survival of surface-released groupers (n = 9; survival similar to 0.0). Furthermore, HMMs estimated zero survival for an additional five descended groupers at a wreck site in 240-m depth, although one analysis using prior information suggested that survival was possible in that depth. These estimates were aided by the objectivity of HMMs, and we recommend that future survival studies involving acoustic tagging employ similar methodologies. The improved survival of groupers after descending is an important finding for management, as this taxon contains several species of impaired stock status or fishery status.",,,,,,,,,13,0,0,0,11,0,14,,,0275-5947,1548-8675,,,,,,,,,,"North Carolina State Univ, Dept Appl Ecol, Ctr Marine Sci & Technol, 303 Coll Circle, Morehead City, NC 28557 USAUniv St Andrews, Ctr Res Ecol & Environm Modelling, Sch Math & Stat, St Andrews KY16 9LZ, Fife, ScotlandNatl Marine Fisheries Serv, Southeast Fisheries Sci Ctr, Beaufort, NC 28516 USA",,,,2020-11-24,WOS:000588311700001,,

In forested ecosystems, many structural attributes (trees, understory plants and woody debris) create heterogeneous ecosystems that provide numerous ecosystem services, including many that are culturally important. However, application of the ES framework to forest management is challenged by difficulties measuring and comparing multiple ES across diverse and heterogeneous forest conditions. Indicators can help bring the ES approach to forest management by providing a means for accurate ES inventory and mapping. We measured 10 forest ES in contrasting forest types to investigate the effects of past forest harvesting in coastal temperate rainforest of Vancouver Island, BC, Canada. Our objectives were to build a systematic set of ES indicators for coastal temperate forests based on forest structural features, including trees, coarse woody debris, and under story plants. To achieve this, we 1) analyzed field data to compare the effects of forest age (old-growth vs. second-growth) and ecological site conditions (riparian vs. upland forest) on the bundle of ES provided by different forest types; and 2) worked with a local indigenous wood carver to identify attributes of cedar trees (Thuja plicata) essential for traditional uses, including canoe carving. Forest age and forest type had significant and major effects on bundles of ES. Old-growth forests provided three times higher carbon storage, nine times higher wood volume, and eighteen times higher canopy habitat services than recovering forests. Within old-growth forests, the proportion of trees suitable for traditional indigenous wood carving was significantly higher in riparian stands. Yet of 456 trees measured, only 17 were cedar with potential traditional uses. Of those, trees for canoe carving were the least frequent (n =3), which we identified as large (>110 cm DBH) trees of exceptional quality. In general, old-growth riparian forests were a hotspot of ES, providing for example nearly three times as much carbon storage as old-growth forests on upland sites and 12 times the amount of carbon storage as found in second-growth forests on upland sites. These results indicate that typical inventories of forest ES, which usually generalize across heterogeneity, may oversimplify dramatic variations in ES bundles in forested landscapes. Our novel set of stand-level ES indicators can improve the accuracy of ES assessments, incorporate important cultural ES, and help address the role of landscape heterogeneity in influencing ES.

It was divided into three third-order sequences, namely SQs1, SQs2, and SQs3 from bottom to top. Each sequence can be divided into a transgressive system tract (TST) and a highstand system tract (HST). Furthermore, four sequence boundaries and three maximum flooding surfaces were identified, and they are the bottom interface SBs and maximum flooding surface mfss1 of SQs1, the bottom interface SBs1 and maximum flooding surface mfss2 of SQs2, the bottom interface SBs3 and maximum flooding surface mfss3 of SQs3, and the top interface SBx from bottom to top. Carbonate tidal flat-clastic tidal flat sedimentary system developed in Shanxi Formation in the northeast Zhoukou Depression (also referred to as the study area) under the control of regression. Meanwhile, four sedimentary microfacies were identified in the sedimentary system, which are lime-mud flats, sand flats, mixed flats, and mud flats. The transgression in the study area occurred from the southeast to the northwest. Therefore, the northwestern part is the seaward side, and the southeastern part is the landward side. As revealed by relevant drilling data, SQs1 of the Shanxi Formation is characterized by the development of limestone and carbonaceous mudstone, with limestone, dark mudstone, and carbonaceous mudstone mainly developing. Meanwhile, lime-mud flats were mainly deposited in it. During the periods of SQs2 and SQs3, the sedimentary environment of the study area changed from the carbonate tidal flats to clastic tidal flats as the coastline migrated towards the sea. In these periods, sand flats mainly developed near the maximum flooding surfaces and were relatively continuous in the eastern and southern parts of the transgressive system tract; mixed flats were relatively continuous in the western and northern parts of the transgressive system tract as well as the eastern and southern parts of the highstand system tract; mud flats widely developed in the highstand system tract. Peat flats mainly developed in the period of HSTs2, with coal seams relatively developing in the southeastern part of the study area as revealed by drilling data. The peat flats in SQs2 are favorable hydrocarbon source layers, the lime-mud flats in SQs1 and sand flats formed in the transgression periods of SQs2 and SQs3 constitute favorable hydrocarbon reservoirs, and the mud flats form in the transgressions periods serve as favorable cap rocks. Therefore, the study area features a reservoir-cap assemblage for self-generating and self-storing of hydrocarbon, and the southeastern part of the study area can be taken as a favorable exploration area.

Tidal hydrokinetic energy is the energy in the currents associated with the rise and fall of ocean tides. Interest in tidal energy development is driven by three aspects of the resource: it is renewable, predictable, and concentrated. However, a renewable resource is a necessary, but not sufficient condition for sustainable power generation. At present, the tools to assess large-scale, sustainable utilization of tidal energy are underdeveloped, and a comprehensive synthesis of pilot project results has not been completed. The objective of this project is to improve the understanding of tidal energy systems and to develop tools that will enable a sustainable pathway for tidal energy. Sustainable, large-scale tidal energy development will need to balance the benefits of renewable power generation against environmental and societal costs. This balance can be, in part, informed by scenario analyses that scale up information gained from pilot projects. Currently, frameworks to implement effective scenario analysis are undermined by broad technical, environmental, and social uncertainties. This project will integrate fundamental research from energy engineering, ocean sciences, and social sciences to evaluate large-scale tidal energy sustainability. In doing so, the trade-offs between technological, environmental, and societal costs will be identified and quantified. Research will focus on high-priority knowledge gaps and apply the results to scenario-based analyses including technical ones: multi-turbine array performance; assimilation between oceanographic and detailed array models; environmental ones: turbine noise; fisheries interactions; energy removal at estuarine scale; and social ones: public values and perception; anticipatory governance. The post-doctoral and graduate researchers engaged in this work are integral to developing an interdisciplinary workforce capable of extending the proposed framework to tidal energy applications and to other sustainability challenges. Their professional development will involve direct engagement in all facets of the research, and they will participate in the annual, international symposium hosted by the International Network for Offshore Renewable Energy. While tidal energy development has been accelerated by adapting technologies from the wind and offshore oil and gas industries, technology convergence has been limited for the devices intended to harness the power in tidal currents. A wide range of competing design options and array layouts have been proposed for large-scale development. This breadth of approaches provides a window of opportunity for environmental and social information from early-stage projects to influence future technology convergence. Through iterative, scenario-based analysis this research will demonstrate that, once fundamental knowledge gaps are addressed, environmental and social information can be incorporated into engineering decisions to reduce the economic, environmental, and societal costs associated with large-scale tidal energy development. This has the potential to fundamentally alter the pathway towards technology convergence and public perceptions of marine renewable energy sustainability.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,1230426,,,,,,,,University of Washington,,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:14021004,,

Studying the detailed behaviour of marine mammals involves challenges not faced by most animal behaviour researchers due to the size, mobility and lack of continuous visibility of these animals. We describe several methods developed by marine mammal scientists to study behaviour, primarily of cetaceans, focusing on technological advances: unmanned aerial systems (UAS), satellite-linked telemetry, passive acoustics and multisensor high-resolution acoustic recording tags. We then go on to explain how the data collected by these methods have contributed to and informed conservation actions. We focus on examples including: satellite data informing the interactions between cetaceans and offshore oil and gas development; passive acoustics used to track distributions of several species of cetaceans, including their movements near shipping lanes; and high-resolution acoustic recording tags used to document responses of cetaceans to anthropogenic activities. Finally, we discuss recent efforts to link animal behaviour to individual fitness and, particularly for behavioural disturbances, to population-level consequences, which can be helpful for informing conservation efforts. The infusion of technological advancements into studies of cetacean behaviour combined with emerging analytical techniques brings us to the next 20+ years of studying these animals.

Mangrove forests occupy only 2% of the world's coastal ocean area yet they account for about 5% of net primary production, 12% of ecosystem respiration and about 30% of carbon burial on all continental margins in subtropical and tropical seas. Mangroves also account for nearly one-third of all riverine DIC discharging into low latitude coastal waters. Mangrove forests fix, release and sequester more carbon by area than all other coastal ecosystem types, except perhaps for subtropical and tropical seagrass meadows for which data are lacking. Globally, mangrove waters release to the atmosphere more than 2.5 times (-42.8 Tg Cy-1) the amount of CO2 emitted from all other subtropical and tropical coastal waters. The global destruction of the large carbon stocks (956 Mg C ha(-1)) of mangroves at the current annual rate of about 1% results in an additional annual release of roughly 133 Tg C y(-1) to the atmosphere. Mangroves account for only 0.7% of tropical forest area globally, but their destruction currently adds another 10% to global CO2 release from tropical deforestation. Despite considerable uncertainty upscaling small numbers of measurements with large coefficents of variation, our calculations suggest that mangroves are a globally significant contributor to the carbon cycle in low latitude seas, and to greenhouse emissions resulting from tropical deforestation.

This study assessed predation on nests of the endangered loggerhead sea turtle (Caretta caretta) at Wreck Rock beach adjacent to Deepwater National Park in Southeast Queensland, Australia after a control program for feral foxes was instigated. The presence of predators on the nesting dune was evaluated by tracking plots (2 x 1 m) every 100 m along the dune front. There were 21 (2014-2015) and 41 (2015-2016) plots established along the dune, and these were monitored for predator tracks daily over three consecutive months in both nesting seasons. Predator activities at nests were also recorded by the presence of tracks on top of nests until hatchlings emerged. In addition, camera traps were set to record the predator activity around selected nests. The tracks of the fox (Vulpes vulpes) and goanna (Varanus spp) were found on tracking plots. Tracking plots, nest tracks and camera traps indicated goanna abundance varied strongly between years. Goannas were widely distributed along the beach and had a Passive Activity Index (PAI) (0.31 in 2014-2015 and 0.16 in 2015-2016) approximately seven times higher than that of foxes (PAI 0.04 in 2014-2015 and 0.02 in 2015-2016). Five hundred and twenty goanna nest visitation events were recorded by tracks but no fox tracks were found at turtle nests. Camera trap data indicated that yellow-spotted goannas (Varanus panoptes) appeared at loggerhead turtle nests more frequently than lace monitors (V. varius) did, and further that lace monitors only predated nests previously opened by yellow-spotted goannas. No foxes were recorded at nests with camera traps. This study suggests that large male yellow-spotted goannas are the major predator of sea turtle nests at the Wreck Rock beach nesting aggregation and that goanna activity varies between years.",,,,,,,,,21,0,0,0,18,0,22,,,2167-8359,,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Queensland, Sch Biol Sci, St Lucia, Qld, Australia",,,,2017-06-30,WOS:000405264100005,28674666,

The engineering challenge is to design components that are robust enough to meet reliability targets whilst lean enough to minimise cost. This is particularly the case for offshore marine renewable installations which operate in the same, possibly harsher, environment as offshore oil and gas installations, and are subjected to highly cyclic and dynamic wave, wind and operational load conditions. The cost of electricity produced has to compete with other means of electricity generation and does thus not offer the same profit margins available as oil and gas commodities. As a result, components for marine renewable installations have to meet the target reliability, without the application of costly safety factors to account for load and environmental uncertainties. Industries with similar design tasks such as the aviation or automotive industry have successfully used a service simulation test approach to develop robust yet lean designs.This paper builds on an approach to establish and validate the reliability of floating renewable energy devices in which dedicated component testing using the purpose built Dynamic Marine Component test rig (DMaC) plays a pivotal role to assess, validate and predict the reliability of components in the marine environment. This paper presents a test rig for both static and fatigue tests of marine components such as mooring lines and mooring shackles under simulated or measured load conditions and provides two case studies from recently conducted mooring component tests.

This may include partial removal (from the surface to 26 m depth) or complete removal of the platform structure. While complete removal would likely eliminate most of the existing fish biomass and associated secondary production, we find that the potential impacts of partial removal would likely be limited on all but one platform off the coast of California. On average 80% of fish biomass and 86% of secondary fish production would be retained after partial removal, with above 90% retention expected for both metrics on many platforms. Partial removal would likely result in the loss of fish biomass and production for species typically found residing in the shallow portions of the platform structure. However, these fishes generally represent a small proportion of the fishes associated with these platforms. More characteristic of platform fauna are the primarily deeper-dwelling rockfishes (genus Sebastes). Shell mounds are biogenic reefs that surround some of these platforms resulting from an accumulation of mollusk shells that have fallen from the shallow areas of the platforms mostly above the depth of partial removal. We found that shell mounds are moderately productive fish habitats, similar to or greater than natural rocky reefs in the region at comparable depths. The complexity and areal extent of these biogenic habitats, and the associated fish biomass and production, will likely be reduced after either partial or complete platform removal. Habitat augmentation by placing the partially removed platform superstructure or some other additional habitat enrichment material (e.g., rock boulders) on the seafloor adjacent to the base of partially removed platforms provides additional options to enhance fish production, potentially mitigating reductions in shell mound habitat.",,,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2016-05-18,DRCI:DATA2016080008567214,,

An archetypical example is the endangered Florida panther, whose conservation status is intrinsically linked to population size, but for which reliable abundance information is lacking across its range. This is due not only to the inherent difficulty of sampling a rare and elusive species over a large geographic area, but also because of restricted scientific access to private land. Human interactions with wildlife are a regular occurrence, and interactions with non-scientists constitute an important and underutilized source of information about species distribution and abundance. For example, motor vehicle collisions with Florida panthers are recurrent on the vast network of roads within the public and private lands comprising its range in southern Florida, USA. Capitalizing on a tendency for the public to report collisions with species of concern to wildlife officials, we describe a novel methodology using public reports along with routine telemetry monitoring data to produce the first statistically defensible population estimates for the Florida panther across its entire breeding range. In essence, our approach uses traffic volume and road density to estimate the probability of motor vehicle collision mortality from telemetered animals and models counts reported by the public accordingly. Despite low motor vehicle collision mortality probabilities, our methodology achieved abundance estimates of reasonable precision (29% CV) that was similar to that of previous panther studies using conventional approaches on much smaller study areas. While recovery criteria require establishment of three distinct populations of 240 Florida panthers, we found this single population may never have exceeded 150 individuals from 2000 to 2012.Synthesis and applications. By extracting critical demographic information from underutilized aspects of human-wildlife ecology, our citizen-based approach can cost less than conventional alternatives and could conceivably be used for long-term population monitoring of other species over broad geographic areas, for example from reports of avian wind farm collisions, beached whales or marine mammal boat strikes. An additional benefit is that it can be applied to historical data sets of carcass recovery programmes, in our case permitting abundance estimation over a 13-year period.By extracting critical demographic information from underutilized aspects of human-wildlife ecology, our citizen-based approach can cost less than conventional alternatives and could conceivably be used for long-term population monitoring of other species over broad geographic areas, for example from reports of avian wind farm collisions, beached whales or marine mammal boat strikes.

Although current leases require lessees in both state and federal waters to completely remove all production facilities and restore the seafloor to its preplatform condition, other options have emerged since these leases were signed. Laws and regulations in other jurisdictions (particularly in federal waters) have evolved to allow a number of other uses such as aquaculture, alternative energy production, and artificial reefing. In response, the California Natural Resources Agency initiated an effort to investigate the issues associated with these and other decommissioning alternatives. The papers in this series are the result of the second phase in this process, a broad investigation of the engineering, economic, and environmental costs and benefits of the most feasible and likely options. In addition to the project's final report, the authors produced an interactive mathematical decision model, PLATFORM, that enables users to explore the implications of different decommissioning projects and options, as well as the effects of different approaches to valuing the associated costs and benefits.

Scientific knowledge of CWC is limited, and many citizens have not even heard about them. This creates problems for the application of the stated preference methods to capture their economic value, and very few such studies have been conducted. To fill this gap, we designed a discrete choice experiment, which was implemented in a valuation workshop setting in order to derive estimates of participants' willingness to pay (WTP) for increasing the protection of CWC Despite the fact that marine industries such as oil/gas and fisheries could be adversely affected by CWC protection, this did not reduce the respondents' willingness to pay for further protection. The possibility that CWCs play an important role as habitat for fish was the single most important variable to explain respondents' WTP for CWC protection. The survey revealed a high degree of preference heterogeneity, while we found an average WTP for CWC protection in the range of EUR 274-287. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

The effects of a gradient in disturbance that results in the thinning of kelp, however, have not been explored. We conducted manipulations corresponding to 0%, 33%, 66%, and 100% removal of Macrocystis pyrifera (L) C. Ag at three sites along Santa Catalina Island, California. Surveys of fishes conducted 1-3 months after the removal of M. pyrifera revealed differences in recruitment for Brachyistius frenatus (Gill). Additionally, a trend was seen for Oxyjulis californica (Gunther) showing an increase in recruit fish densities in treatments with higher amounts of M. pyrifera. For older life stages, there also were differences among treatments in the numerical densities of Chromis punctipinnis (Cooper). Paralabrax clathratus (Girard), and B. frenatus and in the biomass densities of P. clathratus and B. frenatus. Algae surveys conducted annually in the 2 years following disturbance showed the stipe densities of M. pyrifera among all treatments were at least as high as at the initiation of the experiment, indicating that treatments of M. pyrifera removal had recovered quickly to pre-disturbance levels. With one exception, there were no differences in recruitment or in the numerical or biomass densities of older juvenile and adult fishes among treatments in either of the two years following the initial disturbance. M. pyrifera in mature vs. recovering forests differs in its distribution and morphology, which might influence recruitment of kelp-associated fishes. To investigate these differences we conducted an experiment manipulating the distribution of adult and juvenile fronds of M. pyrifera. Recruitment of fishes was significantly higher on adult M. pyrifera and bundled fronds of juvenile M. pyrifera than on a dispersed distribution of juvenile M. pyrifera, indicating that the distribution of fronds primarily influences recruitment of kelp-associated fishes. Our results indicate that a gradient in disturbance and variation in the density of fronds of M. pyrifera influences recruitment and the distribution of older life stages of fishes, revealing some patterns at intermediate levels of removal that would not be observed by the simple presence or absence of this habitat. Although recovery of M. pyrifera to pre-manipulation levels was achieved over a relatively short period time in this study, variation in recruitment and the abundance of kelp forest fishes as a result of disturbance will depend on the intensity of the disturbance, the conditions that promote or delay habitat recovery, and the life history characteristics of individual species.

The foundations of the turbine towers consist of open steel pipe piles (monopiles) with a diameter of 4.60m, driven approximately 30m into the seabed. The governing loads on the foundation are mainly horizontal loads, caused by wind, wave and current action. These loads are highly variable; therefore a fatigue analysis, including driving fatigue, is an important part of the design. The driving fatigue has been predicted by a dynamic analysis based on stress wave propagation through the pile. Based on the amount of blows (number of cycles) and the stress range, the fatigue damage to the pile can be obtained for every pile section. It was found that driving of the pile contributed up to 13% to the overall fatigue damage. During installation of the foundation piles a pile-testing program was carried out. The tests were used to measure the compressive and tensile stresses during driving. It was found that the actual driving damage was lower than the estimated damage based on the driveability analysis as performed before driving. It can be concluded that the assumptions for the driveability analysis were conservative with regard to fatigue of the pile as a result of driving, however the contribution of the pile installation to the overall fatigue damage cannot be neglected.",,,,,8th International Conference on the Application of Stress-Wave Theory to Piles8th International Conference on the Application of Stress-Wave Theory to Piles,"SEP 08-10, 2008SEP 08-10, 2008",Inst Superior Tecn; Int Soc Soil Mech; Geotech Engn ISSMGE TC18Inst Superior Tecn; Int Soc Soil Mech; Geotech Engn ISSMGE TC18,"Lisbon, PORTUGALLisbon, PORTUGAL",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,978-1-58603-909-7,,,,,,,,,,,,,2008-01-01,WOS:000273118700017,,

The structure, called acadja corresponds to an artificial reef of bamboo stuck into the sediment. The periphytic and phytoplanktonic biomasses within the acadja were 4 times higher than that of lagoon water and 73% of this biomass corresponded to the fixed community. The total autotrophic production of acadja estimated at 9.9 g C.m-2 cntdot j-1 was 4.5 times higher than that of lagoon water, of which 80 % are produced by the periphytic population. This high productivity of acadja is linked to : - an important spatial concentration of the periphyton which is not exposed to the hydrodynamic effects and is little affected by sedimentation processes; - a productivity per biomass unit and a photosynthetic efficiency significantly higher for fixed communities than for pelagic communities. The periphyton included 3 groups of filamentous algae dominated by a Chlorophyceae (Rhizoclonium riparium) and some Cyanobacteria of the genus Lyngbia for the more productive surface layers and a Rhodophyceae (Audouinella daviesii) for deeper layers. These filamentous algae were in turn colonized by epiphytic Diatoms forming a diversified (37 species) sub-community dominated by the genera Melosira and Nitzschia. Considering the high photosynthetic yield of the fixed communities (5.2% for periphyton against 0.8% for phytoplankton), acadja allows a noticeable increase in the natural productivity of the lagoon environment. In acadja, phytophagous fish farming would constitute a possible use of the surplus autotrophic production.",,,,,,,,,17,0,0,0,8,0,18,,,0240-8783,,,,,,,,,,,"Orstom, B.P. 5045, 34032 Montpellier, France",,,,1993-01-01,BCI:BCI199598184183,,

It is near the coastal economic zone of Guangdong province where a large number of CO2 emission sources are located. Carbon dioxide enhanced oil recovery (EOR) represents an opportunity to promote offshore carbon capture, utilization and storage (CCUS) deployment because CO2 flooding offers a method to recover additional oil while simultaneously sequestering anthropogenic CO2. In this paper, a comprehensive multiparameter quick look' and potential evaluation method was proposed to screen and assess offshore CO2 EOR potential. A screening scheme for the CO2 EOR potential of reservoirs of the PRMB was also proposed using additional parameters, including reservoir properties and engineering design incorporating a dimensionless screen model and calculations. The results show that the suitability of reservoirs for CO2 EOR and storage varies and could be categorized into four priority grades. Approximately 30 of the oil reservoirs from 10 oilfields were preferentially identified by applying the screening method for reservoirs with predicted higher ultimate recovery potentials. It was predicted that 3227x10(4) t of additional oil could be produced from these reservoirs and that 3617x10(4) t of CO2 could be simultaneously stored. The sensitivity analysis shows that injection pressure (P-inj) would be more sensitive than production pressure (P-p) and well distance (L) on the CO2 EOR and storage efficiency, indicating that EOR operations with higher P-inj may improve oil production. The prospective reservoirs include those candidates with suitability grades of I and II from the Lufeng (LF) and Huizhou (HZ) oilfield clusters, where 1164x10(4) t of additional oil could be produced and 1464x10(4) t of CO2 stored with CO2 EOR.

A stable statistical model that included Year and riverine nitrate + nitrite loading for the 2 months prior to the measurement of hypoxic zone size described 82% of its variation in size from 1978 to 2004. The usefulness of the term Year is consistent with the documented increase in carbon stored in sediments after the 1970s, which is when the hypoxic zone is predicted to have become it regular feature on the shelf and to have expanded westward. The increased carbon storage is anticipated to cause a sedimentary respiratory demand influencing the size of the zone, and whose temporal influence is cumulative and transcends the annual variations in nitrogen loading. The variable Year is negatively correlated with the TN:TP ratio in a way that suggests N, not P, has become more important as a factor limiting phytoplankton growth in the last 20 years. Nitrogen, in particular nitrate + nitrite, and not phosphorus, dissolved silicate, or their molar ratios, appears to be the major driving factor influencing the size of the hypoxic zone oil this shelf. This conclusion is consistent with cross-system analyses that conclude that the TN:TP ratio in the Mississippi River, currently fluctuating around 20:1, is indicative of nitrogen, not phosphorus, limitation of phytoplankton growth. Nutrient management that places stronger emphasis on reducing nitrogen loading as compared to phosphorus loading, is justified. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

The rapid expansion of lionfish in the Caribbean and western Atlantic, and the unregulated fishing for this species, would make the lionfish a suitable candidate as biomonitoring species for oil pollution effects. However, to date little has been published about the responses of lionfish to environmental pollutants. For this study lionfish were collected in the Florida Keys a few weeks after Hurricane Irma, which sank numerous boats resulting in leaks of oil and fuel, and during the winter and early spring after that. Several biomarkers indicative of exposure to PAHs (bile fluorescence, cytochrome P450-1A induction, glutathione 5-transferase activity) were measured. To establish if these biomarkers are inducible in PAH exposed lionfish, dosing experiments with different concentrations of High Energy Water Accommodated Fraction of crude oil were performed. The results revealed no significant effects in the biomarkers in the field collected fish, while the exposure experiments demonstrated that lionfish did show strong effects in the measured biomarkers, even at the lowest concentration tested (0.3% HEWAF, or 25 mu g/1 Sigma PAH50). Based on its widespread distribution, relative ease of collection, and significant biomarker responses in the controlled dosing experiment, it is concluded that lionfish has good potential to be used as a standardized biomonitoring species for oil pollution in its neotropical realm.",,,,,,,,,6,0,0,0,5,0,6,,,0141-1136,1879-0291,,,,,,,,,,"Clemson Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Coll Sci, Clemson, SC 29634 USAClemson Univ, Coll Sci, Dept Genet & Biochem, Clemson, SC USAClemson Univ, Coll Agr Forestry & Life Sci, Dept Anim & Vet Sci, Clemson, SC USACSS Inc, Charleston, SC USANOAA, Natl Ocean Serv, Natl Ctr Coastal Ocean Sci, Charleston, SC USAClemson Univ, Grad Program Environm Toxicol, Clemson, SC USANOAA, Clemson, SC USA",CSS Inc,,,2020-05-11,WOS:000528612000008,32174335,

Identification and quantification of these breeding habitats are essential to effective conservation. Satellite telemetry and switching state-space modeling (SSM) were used to define inter-nesting habitat of endangered Kemp's ridley turtles (Lepidochelys kempil) in the Gulf of Mexico. Turtles were outfitted with satellite transmitters after nesting at Padre Island National Seashore, Texas, USA, from 1998 through 2013 (n = 60); Rancho Nuevo, Tamaulipas, Mexico, during 2010 and 2011 (n = 11); and Tecolutla, Veracruz, Mexico, during 2012 and 2013 (n = 11). These sites span the range of nearly all nesting by this species. Inter-nesting habitat lies in a narrow band of nearshore western Gulf of Mexico waters in the USA and Mexico, with mean water depth of 14 to 19 m within a mean distance to shore of 6 to 11 km as estimated by 50% kernel density estimate, a-Hull, and minimum convex polygon methodologies. Turtles tracked during the inter-nesting period moved, on average, 17.5 km/day and a mean total distance of 398 km. Mean home ranges occupied were 725 to 2948 km(2). Our results indicate that these nearshore western Gulf waters represent critical inter-nesting habitat for this species, where threats such as shrimp trawling and oil and gas platforms also occur. Up to half of all adult female Kemp's ridleys occupy this habitat for weeks to months during each nesting season. Because inter-nesting habitat for this species is concentrated in nearshore waters of the western Gulf of Mexico in both Mexico and the USA, international collaboration is needed to protect this essential habitat and the turtles occurring within it.",,,,,,,,,12,0,0,0,11,0,14,,,1932-6203,,,,,,,,,,,"Padre Isl Natl Seashore, Natl Pk Serv, Corpus Christi, TX 78418 USAUS Geol Survey, Wetland & Aquat Res Ctr, Davie, FL USAUniv Florida, Ft Lauderdale Res & Educ Ctr, Davie, FL USAUS Geol Survey, Cherokee Nation Technol, Wetland & Aquat Res Ctr, Davie, FL USAGladys Porter Zoo, Brownsville, TX USAAcuario Veracruz AC, Veracruz, Veracruz, MexicoNOAA, Natl Marine Fisheries Serv, Southwest Fisheries Sci Ctr, La Jolla, CA USA",Gladys Porter ZooAcuario Veracruz AC,,,2017-04-26,WOS:000398945800060,28319178,

A flyshooter, a trawler and a gillnetter participated in this study. In general, catch rates were substantially higher on gravel or stone bottom and at ship wrecks than on sand bottom. The difference in the catch rates between the two bottom categories at paired stations within a short distance was highly significant for all the three fishing methods. Similarly, average CPUE for most surveys was several times higher on rough than on smooth bottom. These differences were highly significant for early autumn surveys conducted with the flyshooter and trawler and all gillnet surveys, the summer surveys for the flyshooter and the gillnetter, but not for the winter surveys with the trawler and the flyshooter.

To examine effects of natural and artificial structure on the abundance of intertidal juvenile crabs, 2 experiments were conducted in Kingston Bay, Massachusetts, USA, from July to September, 2012. In the first experiment, structure was manipulated in a two-factor design that was placed in the high intertidal for 3 one-week periods to test for both substrate type (sand vs. rock) and the presence or absence of artificial structure (mesh grow-out bags used in aquaculture, similar to 0.5 m(2) with 62 mm(2) mesh openings). The Asian shore crab, Hemigrapsus sanguineus, and small individuals of the green crab, Carcinus maenas, were observed only in the treatments of rocks and mesh bag plus rocks. Most green crabs were small (<6 mm in carapace width) whereas H. sanguineus occurred in a wide range of sizes. In the second experiment, 3 levels of oyster-shell treatments were established using grow-out bags placed on a muddy sand substrate in the low intertidal zone: mesh grow-out bags without shells, grow-out bags with oyster shells, and grow-out bags containing live oysters. Replicate bags were deployed weekly for 7 weeks in a randomized complete block design. All crabs collected in the bags were juvenile C. maenas (1-15mmcarapace width), and numbers of crabs differed 6-fold among treatments, with most crabs present in bags with live oysters (29.5 +/- 10.6 m(-2) [mean +/- S.D.]) and fewest in bags without shells (4.9 +/- 3.7 m(-2)). Both C. maenas and H. sanguineus occurred in habitats with natural structure (cobble rocks).

Variable profiles and contours showed that salinity and specific conductivity were found to be unreliable in characterising the bay waters because of the interruptions from numerous submarine seeps found inside and outside of the bay. However, temperature, pH, and dissolved oxygen were more robust in characterising bay waters with continuity from the inner bay, past the reef, and out to sea, even with the presence of the seeps.

Here, we provide an insight into the microbial metabolism in sediments from three chronically polluted marine sites along the coastline of Italy: the Priolo oil terminal/refinery site (near Siracuse, Sicily), harbour of Messina (Sicily) and shipwreck of MT Haven (near Genoa). Using shotgun metaproteomics and community metabolomics approaches, the presence of 651 microbial proteins and 4776 metabolite mass features have been detected in these three environments, revealing a high metabolic heterogeneity between the investigated sites. The proteomes displayed the prevalence of anaerobic metabolisms that were not directly related with petroleum biodegradation, indicating that in the absence of oxygen, biodegradation is significantly suppressed. This suppression was also suggested by examining the metabolome patterns.

However, global databases on the extent of C-org stocks in seagrass ecosystems are largely comprised of studies conducted in monospecific beds from a limited number of regions, thus potentially biasing global estimates. To better characterize carbon stocks in seagrass beds of varying structure and composition, and to further expand the current Blue Carbon database to under-represented regions, we evaluate the extent of C-org stocks in the relatively undocumented seagrass meadows of the Arabian Gulf. Surveys were conducted along the coast of Abu Dhabi (UAE) and encompassed sites ranging from sheltered embayments to offshore islands. Seagrass beds consisted of Halodule uninervis, Halophila ovalis and Halophila stipulacea. While seagrasses were widely distributed along the coast, both living and soil C-org stores were relatively modest on an areal basis. Total seagrass biomass ranged from 0.03 to 1.13 Mg C ha(-1), with a mean of 0.4 +/- 0.1 (+/- SEM), and soil C-org stocks (as estimated over the top meter) ranged from 1.9 to 109 Mg C ha(-1), with a mean of 49.1 +/- 7.0 (+/- SEM). However, owing to the expansive distribution of seagrasses in the Arabian Gulf, seagrass Blue Carbon stocks were large, with 400 Gg C stored in living seagrass biomass and 49.1 Tg C stored in soils. Thus, despite low C-org stores for any given location, the overall contribution of seagrass beds to carbon storage are relatively large given their extensive coverage. This research adds to a growing global dataset on carbon stocks and further demonstrates that even seagrass beds dominated by small-bodied species function to store carbon in coastal environments.",,,,,,,,,72,1,0,0,52,1,75,,,1559-2723,1559-2731,,,,,,,,,,"Smithsonian Marine Stn, Ft Pierce, FL 34949 USAFlorida Int Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Miami, FL 33199 USAFlorida Int Univ, Southeast Environm Res Ctr, Miami, FL 33199 USARichard Stockton Coll New Jersey, Galloway, NJ 08205 USAEnvironm Sci Associates, San Francisco, CA 94108 USA",Environm Sci Associates,,,2015-01-01,WOS:000347680300020,,

Within the NPR-A, Teshekpuk Lake and the surrounding area provide important habitat for migratory birds, including large numbers of waterfowl and shorebirds that use the area for breeding and molting. This area has been designated by the Bureau of Land Management as the Teshekpuk Lake Special Area (TLSA) and is estimated to host 22 percent of the entire Pacific black brant (Branta bernicla nigricans) population as it undergoes flightless wing molt. Additionally, numerous other waterfowl species use the area for breeding and molting, including greater white-fronted geese (Anser albifrons), snow geese (Chen caerulescens), Canada geese (Branta hutchinsii), and tundra swans (Cygnus columbianus). A data-derived procedure was developed to define important habitats based on recent distributions of molting birds. That procedure was used to identify areas that could be prioritized for exclusion from oil and gas development within a pre-defined Goose Molting Area in the TLSA. This analysis was requested by the Bureau of Land Management to provide information for the development of alternative scenarios for an updated NPR-A, Integrated Activity Plan/Environmental Impact Statement. Habitat selections were based on the population densities of Pacific black brant and Canada geese and pre-defined thresholds for the minimum fraction of the population contained within selected areas. Selections were based on long-term records of population density combined with global-positioning system data to reveal small-scale patterns of habitat use. The highest population density of the Pacific black brant was found along the Beaufort Sea coast on the eastern edge of the study area, whereas Canada geese were somewhat more widely distributed. Depending on the selection criteria and width of protective buffers placed around selected habitat units, 52-85 percent of the Goose Molting Area was identified as high-priority habitat. The effectiveness of this approach to habitat protection assumes that buffers around selected habitat units are wide enough to provide adequate protection from disturbance related to oil and gas development. This assumption remained a key source of uncertainty that could be addressed through additional study of disturbance effects on molting waterfowl.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,0196-1497,,,,,,,,,,,"Alaska Sci Ctr, 4210 Univ Dr, Anchorage, AK, 99508, USA",,,,2020-07-20,ZOOREC:ZOOR15607050923,,

A time series of surface and subsurface sediment samples were collected to the northwest of the well from 2010 to 2013 for molecular biomarker and bulk carbon isotopic analyses. While no clear trend was observed in subsurface sediments, surface sediments (0-3 cm) showed a clear pattern with total concentrations of n-alkanes, unresolved complex mixture (UCM), and petroleum biomarkers (terpanes, hopanes, steranes) increasing from May to September 2010, peaking in late November 2010, and strongly decreasing in the subsequent years. The peak in hydrocarbon concentrations were corroborated by higher organic carbon contents, more depleted Delta C-14 values and biomarker ratios similar to those of the initial MC252 crude oil reported in the literature. These results indicate that at least part of oil discharged from the accident sedimented to the seafloor in subsequent months, resulting in an apparent accumulation of hydrocarbons on the seabed by the end of 2010. Sediment resuspension and transport or biodegradation may account for the decrease in sedimented oil quantities in the years following the Macondo well spill. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Under the current system, the federal government his jurisdiction and control over leasing and the coastal states share in almost none of the lease revenues. State involvement in the OCS process takes place primarily through the consistency provisions of the Coastal Zone Management Act (CZMA). These provisions state that all activities that affect a state's coastal zone must be consistent with the state's coastal zone management plan. The paper argues that the current system leads to an inefficient amount of OCS development and that efficiency would be enhanced if coastal states had control over the OCS. The paper finds that the two arguments for retaining federal control-(1) national energy security benefits from OCS development, or (2) national environmental benefits from OCS preservation-are flawed.The paper also considers three other proposals: (1) retaining federal control with revenues shared with coastal states, (2) giving coastal states control with revenues shared with inland states, and (3) modifying the leasing system such that states and others could bid in competition with oil companies for the right to delay leasing.

In recent years, concerns have been raised over the biological impacts of this activity, particularly for marine mammals. While exploration occurs in the waters of at least fifty countries where marine turtles are present, the degree of threat posed by seismic surveys is almost entirely unknown. To investigate this issue, a mixed-methods approach involving a systematic review, policy comparison and stakeholder analysis was employed and recommendations for future research were identified. This study found that turtles have been largely neglected both in terms of research and their inclusion in mitigation policies. Few studies have investigated the potential for seismic surveys to cause behavioural changes or physical damage, indicating a crucial knowledge gap. Possible ramifications for turtles include exclusion from critical habitats, damage to hearing and entanglement in seismic survey equipment Despite this, the policy comparison revealed that only three countries worldwide currently include turtles in their seismic mitigation guidelines and very few of the measures they specify are based on scientific evidence or proven effectiveness. Opinions obtained from stakeholder groups further highlight the urgent need for directed, in-depth empirical research to better inform and develop appropriate mitigation strategies. As seismic surveying is becoming increasingly widespread and frequent, it is important and timely that we evaluate the extent to which marine turtles, a taxon of global conservation concern, may be affected.

We use sediment cores and water level data from 14 marshes in Connecticut and New York to evaluate how marsh accretion, mineral and organic accumulation, carbon storage, and hydroperiod have changed from 1900 to 2012. We observe a regional acceleration in marsh accretion beginning around 1940, although marsh accretion did not reach parity with sea level rise for several additional decades. Despite a rise in marsh accretion from 1.0 mm yr(-1) circa 1900 to 3.6 mm yr(-1) at present, the marsh surface has lost elevation relative to tidal datums. Declining relative elevations have led to increased tidal flooding, particularly in high marsh settings. As flooding increased, organic matter accumulation accelerated at all marshes. Accelerating mineral deposition was only observed in areas of short-form Spartina alterniflora. Mineral and organic sediment accumulation co-limit accretion, but organic accumulation was the stronger limiting factor, suggesting that marsh response to sea level rise in the region is sensitive to processes affecting rates of belowground production and decomposition. Marsh carbon storage over the period of study averaged 84 g C m(-2) yr(-1), increasing as accretion accelerated. If marshes remain spatially intact as sea levels rise, these results suggest that marshes have the capacity to become even greater C sinks. (c) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

In India, several evidences are found which indicate that hydrocarbons are also present in the Mesozoic sediments, but exploratory efforts could not be pursued adequately because of (i) seismic imaging problem and (ii) the presence of thick Basalt layers above the Mesozoic sediments. The high seismic reflectivity at the top-basalt interface severely impedes penetration of seismic energy into the deeper layers resulting in seismic imaging problems. Thus the long offset seismic technique can be used to overcome this problem. Long offset seismic data acquisition in Western Offshore of India, as detailed here, has improved the sub basalt imaging significantly. To tackle ghosting issues, a number of methods are applied which enhanced the bandwidth by de-ghosting, and retaining the significant part of lower frequencies.The sub-basalt Mesozoic sediments are important as it contributes 54% of recoverable hydrocarbon reserves worldwide. In the present work, interpretation of Long Offset seismic lines have been demonstrated and the presence of interesting features below the basalt layer is revealed.

Such terrestrial species are often overlooked in the aftermath of marine spills, despite the potential for long-termoil exposure. Wesampled the livers of seaside sparrows residing in oiled and unoiled sites from 2011 to 2014 and quantified expression of cytochrome p450 1A (CYP1A), a gene involved in the metabolism of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). In August 2011, CYP1A expression was markedly higher in birds from an oiled site compared to an unoiled site, but differences had disappeared by June 2012. In June 2013, CYP1A expression was elevated compared to 2012 levels on all sites, including those collected from sites that had not been directly oiled during the spill. This rise in CYP1A expression was possibly due to Hurricane Isaac, whichmade landfall near our sites between the 2012 and 2013 sampling periods. CYP1A expression was significantly attenuated again in June 2014. We also collected sediment samples from the same marshes for a total concentration analysis of PAHs. The PAH concentrations in sediment samples exhibited a similar pattern to the CYP1A data, supporting the link between marsh PAHs and bird CYP1A expression. These results indicate that contamination from marine oil spills can immediately extend to terrestrial ecosystems, and that storms, weather, or other factors may influence subsequent spatial and temporal oil exposure for several additional years.

Damped cylindrical spreading (DCS) describes propagation of the acoustic Mach cone generated by striking a pile and predicts sound exposure level (L-E) versus range. For known water depth and sediment properties, DCS permits extrapolation from a measurement at a known range. Impact assessment criteria typically involve zero-to-peak sound pressure level (L-p,L-pk), root-mean-square sound pressure level (L-p,L-rms), and cumulative sound exposure level (L-E,L-cum). To facilitate predictions using DCS, L-p,L-pk and L-p,L-rms were estimated fromLEusing empirical regressions. Using a wind farm construction scenario in the North Sea, DCS was applied to estimate ranges to recommended thresholds in fishes. For 3500 hammer strikes, the estimated LE,cumimpact ranges for mortal and recoverable injury were up to 1.8 and 3.1 km, respectively. Applying a 10 dB noise abatement measure, these distances reduced to 0.29 km for mortal injury and 0.65 km for recoverable injury. An underlying detail that produces unstable results is the averaging time for calculatingLp,rms, which by convention is equal to the 90%-energy signal duration.

The relationship amongst analysed heavy metals is strong, but between PLI, LOI and chi is weak. Generally sediments around Munin wreck demonstrate the strong correlation of mass magnetic susceptibility with toxic elements. This is the result of the shipwrecks location and hydrodynamic conditions of this area. The low heavy metal concentration and chi values indicate low level of contamination around both wrecks.",,,,,,,,,2,0,0,0,2,0,2,,,2190-5193,,978-3-319-60213-4; 978-3-319-60212-7,,,,,,,,,"Polish Acad Sci, Inst Geophys, Warsaw, PolandUniv Gdansk, Inst Oceanog, Gdynia, Poland",,,,2018-05-16,WOS:000431343100004,,

Here we report the results of a five-week experiment carried out in the closed core of a vertically coherent, mesoscale eddy of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current, during which we tracked sinking particles from the surface to the deep-sea floor. A large diatom bloom peaked in the fourth week after fertilization. This was followed by mass mortality of several diatom species that formed rapidly sinking, mucilaginous aggregates of entangled cells and chains. Taken together, multiple lines of evidence-although each with important uncertainties-lead us to conclude that at least half the bloom biomass sank far below a depth of 1,000 metres and that a substantial portion is likely to have reached the sea floor.

While activities within waters shallower than 200 m have been the focus of previous assessments of anthropogenic impacts, no study has quantified the extent of individual activities or determined the relative severity of each type of impact in the deep sea.Methodology: The OSPAR maritime area of the North East Atlantic was chosen for the study because it is considered to be one of the most heavily impacted by human activities. In addition, it was assumed data would be accessible and comprehensive. Using the available data we map and estimate the spatial extent of five major human activities in the North East Atlantic that impact the deep seafloor: submarine communication cables, marine scientific research, oil and gas industry, bottom trawling and the historical dumping of radioactive waste, munitions and chemical weapons. It was not possible to map military activities. The extent of each activity has been quantified for a single year, 2005.Principal Findings: Human activities on the deep seafloor of the OSPAR area of the North Atlantic are significant but their footprints vary. Some activities have an immediate impact after which seafloor communities could re-establish, while others can continue to make an impact for many years and the impact could extend far beyond the physical disturbance. The spatial extent of waste disposal, telecommunication cables, the hydrocarbon industry and marine research activities is relatively small. The extent of bottom trawling is very significant and, even on the lowest possible estimates, is an order of magnitude greater than the total extent of all the other activities.Conclusions/Significance: To meet future ecosystem-based management and governance objectives for the deep sea significant improvements are required in data collection and availability as well as a greater awareness of the relative impact of each human activity.",,,,,,,,,102,0,0,0,64,1,112,,,1932-6203,,,,,,,,,,,"Natl Oceanog Ctr Southampton, Ocean Biogeochem & Ecosyst Grp, Southampton, Hants, EnglandNatl Oceanog Ctr Southampton, Geol & Geophys Grp, Southampton, Hants, EnglandMedian, Valldoreix, SpainUniv Autonoma Barcelona, Inst Ciencia & Tecnol Ambientals, E-08193 Barcelona, SpainUniv Southampton, GeoData Inst, Southampton, Hants, England",Median,,,2010-09-13,WOS:000281735700025,20856885,

Two structural responses, canopy-opening and below-ground-mass-depletion, govern the photoacclimatory response and facilitate, respectively, light penetration within the canopy and functional adjustments in whole-plant carbon balances. Conversely, canopy-closing may also explain dense canopies formed close to the waterline, as they provide shade and photoprotection to a susceptible leaf physiology under high-light. Canopy light attenuation is primarily regulated by the leaf area index (LAI), which is governed by changes in shoot size and density. Shoot density diminishes non-linearly with depth, while shoot size increases to a maximum followed by a decline. The initial increase in shoot size, which resembles a self-thinning response, increases LAI and meadow production in shallow depths. These seagrass structural adjustments have relevant ecological implications. Canopy-thinning allows macrophyte diversity to increase with depth, while seagrass production and carbon storage diminish exponentially, and are maximal only in a shallow coastal fringe. The results support the universality of plant self-thinning, from phytoplankton to complex canopies, likely the consequence of simple physical laws related to light limitation and pigment self-shading within photosynthetic structures and communities.",,,,,,,,,30,0,0,0,25,0,29,,,2045-2322,,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Unidad Acad Sistemas Arrecifales Puerto Morelos, Lab Fotobiol, Apto Postal 13, Cancun 77500, QR, MexicoUniv Glasgow, Sch Geog & Earth Sci, Gregory Bldg Rm419, Glasgow G12 8QQ, Lanark, ScotlandNumer Opt Ltd, Belmont House, Tiverton EX16 8AA, Devon, England",Numer Opt Ltd,,,2019-10-22,WOS:000489556200035,31601973,

Moreover, Ireland exhibits very ambitious plans for MRE developments. Against a background, where ME development seems to have stalled, the objective of the paper is to analyse the Irish governance setup and its capacity to deliver ME and whether the current system is equipped to enable transition to MREs. Current governance systems lack efficacy in terms of policy integration and enforcement, government oversight, and public trust due to past failures. Although, management approaches have been developed to address some of the barriers, domains such as policy/regulation, industry development and public engagement are disconnected.Results presented may not simply be generalised, as each country context is different.

This type of platform is an assemblage of a cylindrical hull, moorings and risers that responds to hydrodynamic and aerodynamic loads in a complex manner. Coupled behaviours of spar-mooring-riser system influenced by the wind load in random wave environment have been studied using coupled analysis method. The spar-mooring-riser system has been analysed to predict system responses induced by wind action under a long crested random wave using finite element approach. Wind load induces a significant shift in the spar position away from its original place in the random sea state in addition to a notable heave motion reduction.

For the coastal fisheries of developing countries, the problem is aggravated by coastal habitat degradation, widespread poverty in coastal communities, inshore encroachment of commercial fishing vessels, use of illegal and destructive fishing methods, resource use conflicts, pollution from uplands, and weak institutional arrangements. In response to these problems and in the hope of reversing their negative effects, fisheries management strategies have emerged for tropical coastal fisheries during at least the past 30 years. In fisheries, it is crucial to determine the outcomes of management strategies, especially when public money has to be accounted for. However, efforts to assess their impacts or measure progress are usually directed towards a single disciplinary approach, which fails to consider the multi-dimensionality of tropical fisheries including concomitant multi-level and conflicting goals and objectives. This article explores the utility of a multi-criteria type of evaluation as a potential analytical approach in impact evaluation for tropical fisheries management. The general framework of a multi-criteria evaluation method is a two-dimensional matrix composed of different choice possibilities including the set of criteria and indicators that will serve as bases in assessing these choice possibilities. The literature presents various criteria and indicators in fisheries management evaluation, the kinds and number of which would depend on stated goals and objectives of fisheries and the availability of resources to acquire the information. The type of measurement, i.e., quantitative or qualitative, and the weighing of criteria and indicators are crucial in the evaluation process because they determine the multi-criteria aggregation approach to be used. Moreover, the participation of stakeholders and coastal resource users is crucial in complementing scientific information, in developing acceptable solutions, and in reducing conflicts and distrust in the evaluation and decision-making process. While many aggregation models in multi-criteria analysis in natural resource management exist, this article limits its review to only six models: the analytic hierarchy process, the weighted sum model, the ordination technique, concordance analysis, the regime method and Evamix; which are viewed to be applicable to the structure of decision-making in tropical fisheries management. This article also examines the performance of some of these models through a case study that determines the impacts of fisheries management strategies in San Miguel Bay, Philippines.The review reveals the following: (1) among the aggregation approaches, the analytic hierarchy process and ordination technique had the highest number of applications in fisheries while none was found for concordance analysis, the regime method or Evamix; (2) the application of hybrid models in multi-criteria analysis is increasing and found to be effective in many environmental decision problems including fisheries; (3) the application of multi-criteria decision models to fisheries management is relatively scarce during the last 10 years; only 26 papers were found in peer-reviewed journals; and (4) in the choice of model, its technical assumptions and limitations, its appropriatenss for a specific decision-making problem, and its ability to handle the situation correctly vis-a-vis contextual, technical and political concerns should be considered.",,,,,,,,,4,0,0,0,1,0,4,,,,,978-94-007-0393-3,,,,,,,,,"Univ Philippines Visayas, Inst Fisheries Policy & Dev Studies, Coll Fisheries & Ocean Sci, Iloilo 5023, Philippines",,,,2011-07-08,WOS:000287954800014,,

Non-breeding adults were sighted throughout the year, but males incubating eggs were sighted only between September and March. Juveniles were also sighted throughout the year but they appeared to peak between June and November. Most dragons were seen between 4 and 15 m depth, but one was sighted at a wreck site at 37 m. The most popular habitat was reef with macro-algae, particularly along reef edges abutting sand. Netting was perceived to be the most likely threat to seadragon populations. Although these data are from non-quantitative surveys by volunteers, they greatly add to our knowledge of weedy seadragons and the research gaps that need to be filled. In particular, they have identified some breeding populations close to population centres that may need protection.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,0819-6826,,,,,,,,,,,"Tasmanian Marine Naturalists Association Inc., c/o 102 Bathurst St., Hobart, Australia",,,,2003-01-01,ZOOREC:ZOOR14002009800,,

The research project has as its point of departure the potential influences of group level characteristics, structural work factors, trust, and safety behaviour on safety performance. Do perceptions and performance differ across Shelves? Are nomadic groups or employees that have more unpredictable shift rotations more exposed to accidents than others? Is high trust and sound safety behaviour enhancing good safety performance? The results are based on questionnaire data from two samples of personnel distributed across three installations on the UKCS and nine on the NCS with a response rate of 67%: N = 170 (UKCS) and N= 621 (NCS). In addition, two focus group interviews were held in each country, with 15 participants in each. The results show that our model makes sense. Shelf shows a significant influence on safety performance in all but the final stage in our five-step logistic regression model, indicating that the effect may be mediated by safety compliance and safety participation. Installations and different work teams have different exposure and structural work factors matter significantly. Somewhat counter-intuitively, employees who have a nomadic status and who hold the least regular shift rotations appear to have a lower risk of being involved in incidents. High trust in workmates buffers against incident involvement and the same applies for high safety compliance.

This basin is surrounded by Guangxi, Hainan and Guangdong Provinces. Previous studies show that the onshore CO2 storage potential in Southeastern China is limited; thus the CO2 storage potential of offshore basins, including Beibuwan Basin, is crucial for CO2 capture and storage implementation in these areas. This study evaluates the potential for CO2 geological storage in the Beibuwan Basin through a desktop evaluation of existing data, to provide background data for planning regional carbon emission reductions. Deep saline aquifers and hydrocarbon reservoirs within the basin were evaluated for their suitability to store CO2 based on geological, geographical and environmental criteria, and the effective storage capacity was estimated. The estimates show that the Beibuwan Basin has suitable geological conditions with three super reservoirs of high porosity (20-30%) and permeability (200-300 mD) and accompanying three widely distributed efficient sealing layers. The effective capacity for CO2 storage is 485.6 x 10(8) t CO2 in deep saline aquifers of Beibuwan Basin; this capacity could potentially support CO2 sequestration for large power plants onshore in the Beibu Gulf area. The storage capacity of the oil and gas fields is limited, with average values of 42.3 x 10(6) t CO2 and 62.3 x 10(6) t CO2, respectively. The most prospective area for CO2 storage in Beibuwan Basin is within the Weixinan Sag which contains the Weixinan oilfield groups and plenty of potential structural traps, depending on the availability of porous units, including those that are non-oil bearing. The effective CO2 storage capacity of the Weixinan Sag is 47.2 x 10(8) t CO2. Existing geological and geophysical data and facilities, including wells, pipelines and platforms for hydrocarbon production might help reduce costs for offshore CO2 transportation and storage operations. The mode of the oil and gas terminal treatment plant on Weizhou Island provides a centralised management model for CO2 storage. If this mode can be utilised, an offshore CO2 transport and storage cluster can also be created in the Weixinan Sag greatly reducing the cost of offshore storage. Evaluation of the feasibility of using these oil production facilities for CO2 storage and of the risk along abandoned wells and faults is urgent. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

The objective of this synopsis is to illustrate recent trends for contaminants (metals, PAHs, PCBs) in sediments and benthic biota and to consider the evidence for improved environmental quality over the last quarter of a century. Contaminants in sediments and sediment-dwelling fauna such as Hediste (=Nereis) diversicolor are, generally, evenly distributed over the estuary - which is the consequence of extensive re-suspension and redistribution of fine sediment by strong tidal currents. Such dispersal tends to mask the influences of individual discharges and physical characteristics are considered to be the major drivers affecting biodiversity in the Severn Estuary, often overshadowing contaminant concerns. Following the closure of major industries and the introduction of stricter pollution control, many inputs have ceased or been reduced and there are indications that environmental concentrations are now lower. Bioaccumulation of most contaminants has declined accordingly (with the possible exception of Cr). Intuitively, better environmental quality should be linked to ecological improvements. However, due to the dynamic nature of the system (and a lack of biological-effects data) it is difficult to establish direct relationships between inputs, body burdens and biological/ecological consequence. Uniquely, the long-term integrated monitoring program of AstraZeneca (Avonmouth) indicates that recovery of faunal diversity and abundance has occurred in mid-sections of the estuary in recent years implying that contaminants have indeed been a forcing feature for Severn biota. In this context, we highlight contaminant issues and biogeochemical changes which may need to be addressed in connection with the development of proposals for tidal energy schemes.

Seagrasses alter landscapes in a way that stimulates carbon biosequestration, but discussions of their role in atmospheric CO2 mitigation disregard the co-occurring inorganic carbon cycle, whose antagonist effect on CO2 sequestration can buffer and potentially outweigh the effects of C-org production on net carbon exchange with the atmosphere. This study examines the extent of both organic carbon (C-org) and inorganic carbon (C-inorg) stocks as proxies for long-term production and calcification in the poorly studied seagrass meadows of southeastern (SE) Brazil and compares values to Florida Bay (U.S.A.), a well-studied system known for both high autotrophy and calcification, representing extremes of CaCO3 soil content. Seagrass soils in SE Brazil contain an average of 67.6 +/- 14.7 Mg C-org ha(-1) in the top 1 m, compared to an average of 175.0 +/- 20.4 Mg C-org ha(-1) for their counterparts in Florida Bay. C-inorg as CaCO3 in SE Brazil averaged 141.5 +/- 60.0 Mg C-inorg ha(-1) in the top meter of soil while the warmer, calcification-promoting waters of Florida Bay had higher soil C-inorg areal stock, averaging 754.6 +/- 26.7 Mg C-inorg ha(-1). When the CO2 evasion related to CaCO3 production is considered, seagrass ecosystems with high CaCO3 content may have CO2 sequestered via C-org accumulation negated by CO2 produced by calcification.

Most existing studies ignore conflicting preferences and strategic interactions among decision-makers. This paper presents a game theoretical approach to solve multi-criteria conflict resolution problem under constrained and uncertain environments. Uncertainties in the quantification of imprecise data are expressed using rough numbers. A multi-criteria game is developed to model a decision problem in which three groups of decision-makers (i.e., operators, regulators and service engineers) are involved. This game is solved using the generalized maximin solution concept. With the solution (i.e., optimal weights of the criteria), the rough numbers can be aggregated to an expected payoff for each alternative. Finally, the weights of upper and lower limits of a rough number are employed to transform the expected payoff into a crisp score, based on which all alternatives are ranked to identify the best one. A numerical example is outlined to demonstrate the application of the proposed method to the selection of management scenarios of drilling wastes. (C) 2012 The Institution of Chemical Engineers.

To set the scene, some historical aspects of the origins, development, management and research in New Zealand's indigenous grasslands are described, and changes in land tenure are outlined to provide a background against which the ecosystem services that grasslands have to offer can be better understood. The ecosystem services that different grassland types are able to provide are described according to the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment categories, especially those of provisioning (biodiversity values); regulating (water production, pollination, biological control); cultural (educational, scientific, recreational and tourism values); and supporting (soil conservation values, carbon storage and sequestration). The threats to these services are then described with emphasis on land use (grazing and intensification, mining), invasive weeds and invertebrates, and climate change. We conclude by pointing out that indigenous grassland ecosystems deliver a wide range of important ecosystem services that provide many tangible benefits to human well-being, which are best protected in public ownership and managed as a critically important public-good resource.",,,,,,,,,15,0,0,0,12,0,16,,,,,978-0-478-34736-4,,,,,,,,,"Univ Otago, Dept Bot, Dunedin 9054, New ZealandAgRes Invermay, Dunedin, New ZealandLandcare Res, Natl Land Resource Ctr, Palmerston North, New Zealand",,,,2013-01-01,WOS:000331018800001,,

Nowadays, the industry is seeking for environmentally friendly alternatives to power supply those facilities, such as by means of marine renewable energy. Motivated by economic and environmental aspects, this paper addresses the value proposition and investigates the feasibility of implementing combined wave and solar systems for power supplying offshore oil and gas platforms. Three locations where relevant offshore petroleum activities are currently ongoing were selected as case studies and a reference oil and gas platform was assumed. At each case study location, four wave energy converters and one photovoltaic technology were analysed for three scenarios: wave power only, solar power only and both resources combined. The methodology applied, generalizable to other regions with petroleum activities and relevant wave and solar energy resources, consists in scaling the wave energy converters to match wave climate at site, maximizing their energy production, followed by an economic feasibility analysis. Results show that for all sites the combination of both renewable resources increases electricity production, reduces the intra-annual variability of energy production and intermittency issues, increases capacity factors up to 24% and consequently avoids overdesign. The obtained levelized cost of energy is in the range 131-263 (sic)/MWh and the reduction in emissions was estimated at circa 281,915 ton/year at each site, which demonstrates the feasibility and interest of providing electricity from these combined systems to offshore oil and gas platforms. The proposed solution provides benefits that could lead to further decreases in the levelized cost of energy, enabling the entrance to new markets for both wave and solar energy, while facilitating the transition to a more sustainable energy mix. Hence, the further technology development is advocated.",,,,,,,,,35,1,0,0,3,0,37,,,0196-8904,1879-2227,,,,,,,,,,"Equinor ASA, Forusbeen 50, N-4035 Stavanger, NorwayUniv Porto, CIIMAR Interdisciplinary Ctr Marine & Environm Re, Ave Gen Norton de Matos S-N, P-4450208 Matosinhos, PortugalUniv Porto, Dept Civil Engn, FEUP Fac Engn, Rua Dr Roberto Frias S-N, P-4200465 Porto, Portugal",,,,2020-11-25,WOS:000580034200040,,

The expansion state was monitored visually during the discharge of drill cuttings at one reef exposed to discharges and one not exposed. The reef situated down-current from the discharge point was monitored during 5 days and 15 h with a benthic lander equipped with a stills camera and current meter. This reef was exposed to drill cuttings 11 times during the monitoring. The total exposure time was 13 h 37 min. A remotely operated vehicle was used to provide additional images from both reefs for comparison. The proportion of polyps in different expansion states did not differ significantly between exposed corals and unexposed corals. Rather, changes in polyp behaviour were related to changes in current direction and velocity. A higher proportion of the polyps was expanded during periods with prevailing northeasterly currents compared to northwesterly. This could be related to quantity and type of food particles or the polyps' local position in the colony relative to current direction. There was also a clear difference in the degree of polyp expansion between polyps situated high up in the colony compared to low. This may be related to local environmental differences representing different hydrodynamic conditions.

However, concerns have been raised regarding the ecological effects of these projects on fish, including the risk of blade collision and behavioral impacts such as the disruption of migratory behavior and food acquisition and displacement from preferred habitats. We conducted mobile hydroacoustic surveys to track fish as they approached a tidal turbine deployed in Cobscook Bay, Maine. There was a significant decline in fish numbers with decreasing distance to the turbine, beginning approximately 140 m from the turbine. Similar declines were not observed at control transects or when the turbine was not spinning. The decline in fish numbers appeared to be the result of horizontal displacement, not vertical, movements to avoid the turbine. Noise rather than visual cues or flow field disturbance seemed to be a likely explanation for the reduced number of fish near the turbine. This finding, combined with near-field blade collision studies indicating a low probability of encounter, suggests that a single turbine poses a low collision risk to pelagic fish and that a single turbine is likely to result in minimal behavioral responses by fish. However, the risk may be different with additional devices, which will become more relevant as commercial-scale MHK arrays come under consideration. Therefore, the risks associated with commercial-scale operations will ultimately have to be evaluated to fully understand the ecological impacts of MHK devices.",,,,,,,,,4,0,0,0,2,0,4,,,0167-6369,1573-2959,,,,,,,,,,"Argonne Natl Lab, Div Environm Sci, 9700 S Cass Ave, Argonne, IL 60439 USAUniv Maine, Sch Marine Sci, 5741 Libby Hall, Orono, ME 04469 USAUS Army, Engineer Res & Dev Ctr, Ctr Res & Dev, Environm Lab, Portland, OR 97208 USA",,,,2020-10-14,WOS:000574626500002,32939667,

The trace element composition was quite homogeneous among cores: and the pre-industrial concentrations of Ba, Cr, Cu and Ni are naturally high in the region, as to reach levels of potential ecological concern. The influence of multiple and simultaneous processes (e.g. industrial activities, natural seeps, fluvial discharges) on the trace element concentrations is difficult to disentangle. Some cores suggested long-term preservation of putative oil spill traces, although it was not possible to attribute their origin. The Al-normalized redox element ratios, and the crude oil contamination ratio, suggested that these events occurred along almost four decades, and that the traces attributed to the Ixtoc1 spill were comparable to background conditions, most likely owing to active natural oil seeps in the area. In most cases there was a trend towards a lowering in the supply of trace elements: this might be associated with environmental controls in the region since the 1980s. This study highlights the relevance of using dated environmental archives to reconstruct the historical trends of trace metal contamination in areas where long-term environmental studies are scarce.

These provide an unprecedented opportunity to examine a range of climate variability experienced by the coastal Gulf of Alaska (CGOA). By relating these climate events to regional physical and biological observations, using multiple and diverse data sources (GLOBEC observations, historical data sets and reanalyses, satellites, models), we can determine how these events affect mesoscale ocean variability in the CGOA and its related target populations (the primary goal of the NEP program). We can then directly compare these responses to those evident in the California Current System (CCS). There are two overarching goals for this project. 1) Characterize the linkages between basin-scale variability indicative of climate events and local CGOA changes in mesoscale variability that impact ecosystem pattern, structure and productivity. 2) Compare the linkages between basin-scale and local structure in the coastal Gulf of Alaska (CGOA) with those evident in the CCS, contrasting differing ecosystem responses to the same climate signals. The emphasis is on synthesis of physical circulation, upper ocean structure, nutrients and lower (planktonic) trophic levels to develop metrics based on multiple data sets spanning a wide spectrum of space and time scales. A funded GLOBEC-NEP Phase IIIa proposal to the same PIs to carry out similar analyses in the California Current System provides significant leverage, both financially and intellectually. This team of investigators represents expertise in diverse aspects of climate mesoscale interactions and data analysis. They will use correlative methods to characterize mesoscale variability in the CGOA and the concurrent basin-scale conditions during Field Program years, and then extend these comparisons back in time where possible. They will build on these correlational linkages between basin-scale and mesoscale patterns, examining the mechanisms behind these linkages from three points of view: i) comparing interannual and decadal scales of climate variability, ii) identifying and comparing different shelf regions of climate response in the CGOA, and iii) examining changes in seasonal signals. They will then compare and contrast signals observed in the CCS to those in the CGOA. BROADER IMPACTS: This project will contribute to the legacy of the GLOBEC NEP program in the form of analyses (papers), data sets, and indices for monitoring, assessing, and managing marine resources in the CGOA. By integrating and analyzing multiple data sets, the investigators will provide robust indicators of the response of the CGOA shelf to climate change, a useful tool for resource assessment and management. Improvement of ecosystem management strategies for the Alaskan shelf directly affects a large socio-economic sector of the US west coast.

Using a high-quality 2D database consisting of bathymetry, 20 seismic, piston cores, faunal, and radiocarbon data, six major depositional systems are recognized along the northeastern South China Sea margin, and from the upper slope to abyssal plain, they are erosional features, mass-flow systems, sediment gravity-flow (SGF) systems, mixed contourite-SGF systems, contourite systems and hemipelagic systems.Sedimentary processes on the studied margin show considerable spatial complexity, yielding a depositional model that must incorporate the interplay of down-slope and along-slope processes. Erosional features and mass-flow systems are common on upper and middle slopes, respectively, where high mass flows probably dominate over bottom currents. In the lower slope and continental rise where mass flows transform into SGFs, yielding SGF system. In the lower segment of the Taiwan canyon, there is a strong interplay of SGFs and bottom currents, forming the mixed contourite-SGF system. On the abyssal plain where SGFs are volumetrically overwhelmed by contour currents, contourite depositional systems are well developed. Our results highlight the complex interaction between down-slope and along-slope processes on continental margins, thus helping to better understand the deep-water sedimentation.Bottom-current reworked sands lacking 'typical turbidite signatures' are recognized, and are interpreted to be created by the interplay of SGF and bottom currents (including contour currents, bottom currents associated with internal solitary waves and deep-marine tidal bottom currents), which could potentially yield excellent hydrocarbon reservoirs after burial, affording an alternative for interpreting deep-marine non-turbidite reservoirs. Fine-grained bottom-current sediment waves are first recognized in the abyssal plain of the South China Sea and are interpreted to be created by contour currents resulting from the North Pacific Deep Water (NPDW-CCs), providing solid evidence for the intrusion of NPDW into the abyssal plain of the South China Sea. Preliminary bedform-velocity analysis suggests that NPDW-CCs have a maximum flow velocity up to 3 similar to 7 cm/s. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Numerous injection projects, ranging from small injection pilots to much larger longer-term commercial operations, have been successfully monitored to the satisfaction of regulatory agencies, and technologies have been adapted and implemented to demonstrate containment, conformance, and no environmental impact. In this review we consider M&V chiefly from the perspective of its ability to satisfy stakeholders that these three key requirements are being met. From selected project examples, we show how this was done, and reflect particularly on the nature of the verification process. It is clear that deep-focussed monitoring will deliver the primary requirement to demonstrate conformance and containment and to provide early warning of any deviations from predicted storage behaviour. Progress in seismic imaging, especially offshore, and the remarkable results with InSAR from In Salah are highlights of the past decade. A wide range of shallow monitoring techniques has been tested at many sites, focussing especially on the monitoring of soil gas and groundwater. Quantification of any detected emissions would be required in some jurisdictions to satisfy carbon mitigation targets in the event of leakage to surface: however, given the likely high security of foreseeable storage sites, we suggest that shallow monitoring should focus mainly on assuring against environmental impacts. This reflects the low risk profile of well selected and well operated storage sites and recognizes the over-arching need for monitoring to be directed to specific, measureable risks. In particular, regulatory compliance might usefully involve clearer articulation of leakage scenarios, with this specificity making it possible to demonstrate no leakage in a more objective way than is currently the case. We also consider the monitoring issues for CO2-EOR, and argue that there are few technical problems in providing assurance that EOR sites are successfully sequestering CO2; the issues lie largely in linking existing oil and gas regulations to new greenhouse gas policy. We foresee that, overall, monitoring technologies will continue to benefit from synergies with oil and gas operations, but that the distinctive regulatory and certification environments for CCS may pose new questions. Overall, while there is clearly scope for technical improvements, more clearly posed requirements, and better communication of monitoring results, we reiterate that this has been a decade of significant achievement that leaves monitoring and verification well placed to serve the wider CCS enterprise.

Developing standardised environmental impact assessment (EIA) practices would allow for potential impact concerns to the marine environment to be identified and mitigated early during project development. In an effort to help formulate a standardised EIA framework that addresses knowledge gaps in fish-current interactions at tidal energy candidate sites, Scherelis et al. [1] presented a case study for investigating changes in fish aggregations in response to changing environmental conditions including tidal currents at a tidal energy candidate site in Australia prior to turbine installation. Here, we present the dataset utilised for this study titled Investigating biophysical linkages at tidal energy candidate sites: a case study for combining environmental assessment and resource characterisation [1] . The dataset includes tidal current information from an Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler (ADCP), volume backscattering measurements from a four-frequency biological echosounder (Acoustic Zooplankton and Fish Profiler - AZFP) as an indica tor for fish biomass, and fish aggregation metrics calculated from volume backscatter in post-processing. ADCP and AZFP were installed on a bottom-mounted mooring and engaged in a concurrent sampling plan for-2.5 months from Decem-ber 2018 to February 2019. The mooring was deployed in the Banks Strait, a tidal energy candidate site located in the northeast of Tasmania, Australia, at a location favourable for tidal turbine installations considering current speed, depth, substrate, sediment type and proximity to shore. The ADCP dataset includes current velocity and direction measurements at 1 m vertical and 1-min time intervals. The raw AZFP dataset includes volume backscattering strength collected in 4-s time intervals with a vertical resolution of 0.072 m in raw, and 0.1 m in pre-processed form. Several post-processing steps were implemented to mitigate changes in background noise due to current speed and wind stress, and to isolate acoustic fish returns from remaining scattering sources. Once isolated, volume backscatter containing fish targets under-went post-processing to determine fish aggregation metrics including density, abundance, centre of mass, dispersion,% water column occupied, evenness, and index for aggrega-tion. Each aggregation metric was then binned by minute matched with corresponding environmental conditions for current speed, shear, temperature, diel stage, and tidal stage. Raw and processed datasets for the AZFP and ADCP are pro-vided. Post-processed data includes the derived fish aggrega-tion metrics along with corresponding environmental condi-tions.

One of the major issues of a diluted bitumen spill on water is whether the product will sink, especially when suspended sediment is present in the water column. This study demonstrated how weathering processes influenced the key spill-related properties of a diluted bitumen product (Cold Lake Blend-Winter), and how interaction of diluted bitumen with sediment affected its tendency to float or sink in water. This study showed that the weathering states of the oils as well as the size of sediment are important factors influencing oil-sediment interactions and the tendency of the formed oil-particulate aggregates for buoyancy. When mixing with fine- and medium-sized sediments, the fresh to moderately weathered oils formed oil-particulate aggregates and sank in saltwater, while the very heavily-weathered oil formed discrete free-floating tarballs.

Deployment of CCS projects in the European Union (E.U.) and the United States (U.S.) may be technologically similar, but will be contextually different. In this paper, we explore the existing energy, policy, regulatory and legal climates that will necessitate different approaches for deployment. The high U.S. dependence on coal makes CCS very important if the U.S. is to achieve deep emissions reductions, while in the E.U. an established climate policy, the importance of off shore projects, and a supportive political climate are favorable to CCS deployment. Additionally, in Europe, regulators must clarify the classification of CO2 within E.U. and international regulations governing on and offshore projects, whereas in the U.S. subsurface property rights, abandoned wells, and state-level jurisdictional difference will play important roles.",,,,,,,,,5,0,0,0,1,0,5,,,1613-7272,1876-0104,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Minnesota, Humphrey Inst Publ Affairs, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA",,,,2007-01-01,WOS:000212524600002,,

It is critical that the behavior of all aspects of the TEC, including the foundation, be understood to optimize not only its reliability but also its cost efficiency. Unlike the majority of offshore energy structures that attempt to minimize the interaction with flowing water, a TEC is designed to interact with this flow through a rotating turbine. The rotating turbine blades, fluctuations in the tidal current speed and direction, wave loading, turbulence, and vibrations all result in a combined cyclic loading of the foundation or anchoring system. A suction caisson is a suitable foundation type to secure tidal current turbines to the seabed. In soft marine clays, the suction caisson provides an ideal foundation for TECs that can be installed without the need of equipment for pile driving or mobilizing gravity base foundation while allowing for the removal of the foundation, contributing to the overall green nature of the device.

Due to their chemical inertness, their removal from anoxic marine sediments is primarily controlled by the activity of anaerobic alkane-degrading microorganisms. To facilitate comprehensive cultivation independent surveys of the diversity and distribution of anaerobic alkane degraders, we designed novel PCR primers that cover all known diversity of the 1-methylalkyl succinate synthase gene (masD/assA), which catalyzes the initial activation of alkanes. We studied masD/assA gene diversity in pristine and seepage impacted Danish coastal sediments, as well as in sediments and alkane-degrading enrichment cultures from the Middle Valley (MV) hydrothermal vent system in the Pacific Northwest. MasD/assA genes were ubiquitously present, and the primers captured the diversity of both known and previously undiscovered masD/assA gene diversity. Seepage sediments were dominated by a single masD/assA gene cluster, which is presumably indicative of a substrate-adapted community, while pristine sediments harbored a diverse range of masD/assA phylotypes including those present in seepage sediments. This rare biosphere of anaerobic alkane degraders will likely increase in abundance in the event of seepage or accidental oil spillage. Nanomolar concentrations of short-chain alkanes (SCA) were detected in pristine and seepage sediments. Interestingly, anaerobic alkane degraders closely related to strain Bu55, the only SCA degrader in pure culture, were found in mesophilic MV enrichments, but not in cold sediments from Danish waters. We propose that the new masD/assA gene lineages in these sediments represent novel phylotypes that are either fueled by naturally occurring low levels of SCA or that metabolize medium- to long chain alkanes. Our study highlights that masD/assA genes are a relevant diagnostic marker to identify seepage and microseepage, e.g., during prospecting for oil and gas, and may act as an indicator of anthropogenic oil spills in marine sediments.",,,,,,,,,21,1,0,0,19,0,23,,,,1664-302X,,,,,,,,,,"Aarhus Univ, Dept Biosci, Ctr Geomicrobiol, Aarhus, DenmarkHarvard Univ, Dept Organism & Evolutionary Biol, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",,,,2015-12-17,WOS:000366989100001,26733961,

We found a shipwreck, a military vessel that probably sunk during the Salerno landing operations of the allied forces in the Second World War. Resistivity data provide information on the vertical and horizontal extension of the shipwreck, which is characterized by very low calculated resistivity values (about 2-5 ohm m). Such values differ significantly from the sand and the bedrock values (5-40 ohm m). Although the presence of the shipwreck is clearly visible from geoelectric data, the joint application of electric, magnetic and multibeam bathymetric techniques reduces the ambiguities inherent in each method. As shown in the Electrical Resistivity Tomography (ERT) and confirmed by the Digital Elevation Model (obtained from the processing of bathymetric data), the shipwreck extends more than 30 m in NE SW direction and it is about 13 m wide. The global extension of the relic is consistent with the magnetic data, that are characterized by a magnetic anomaly with an amplitude of about 1800 nT and similar dimension, as inferred from the estimation of source boundaries obtained from the computation of the analytic signal. The results of our survey encourage the use of marine geoelectrical methods for the detection of buried archaeological targets, particularly in locations where the use of seismic prospecting is not effective (e.g. very shallow water with sandy sea-bottoms). The integration of different geophysical methods allows to better define the extension, depth and thickness of buried objects, suggesting that such an approach is the most effective for underwater archaeological investigations.

The total concentrations (dry weight) of parent PAHs and alkyl-PAHs ranged from 121.9 to 735.4 and 42.3-1149.9 ng/g, respectively. The estuary and harbor were the two regions with the highest levels of PAHs in the sediment. Conversely, sedimentary PAHs in the oil spill areas and remote coastal areas showed significantly lower levels. Although the results of the source identification indicated the up to 75.2% of the contribution from petroleum and its derivatives, this could only reflect the direct impact of the Karachi city on the presence of PAHs in the coastal sedimentary environment and did not indicated that the oil spill continues to stay 11 years later. Compared with 11 years ago, the sharply reduced PAH content, great changed composition, and the degradation driven trend of diagnostic ratios all indicated a sharp decrease in the influence of PAHs caused by the oil spill.

In the development of the standard requirements, evaluation of actual engineering practices could indicate the level of workplace safety. A study was conducted to identify risk and safety measures concerning the use of timber scaffold boards in construction. This article discusses on the occupational risks and ergonomics issues of the scaffolding application based on the physical and mechanical conditions of tropical timber scaffold boards extracted from offshore oil and gas rigs. The boards were exposed to a seasonal climate of East Coast monsoon of South China Sea between November and February. The scaffolding application extended up to 20 m directly above the ocean surface and some boards were completely immersed below the ocean surface particularly during elevated tidal waves. Some of the boards were installed as the on-deck platforms. Forty scaffold boards fabricated from tropical timber species were evaluated. Physical characteristics of the boards were described by natural and man-made factors. A three-point bending test was conducted to determine the maximum load capacity of each board and the mode of fracture was evaluated. Timber identification test was conducted to identify the groups of the timber being used. The microscopic observation confirmed the presence of hyphae which indicated the biological deterioration has happened in some of the boards.

Part of this new regime involves the preparation of a 'safety case' for each installation operating on the UKCS. Details vary according to installation type and function, but, as a minimum, the safety case has to demonstrate that (i) the management systems comply with health and safety law; (ii) a regular independent audit of the management system has been provided for; (iii) potential hazards that can cause major accidents have been identified; and (iv) risks of major accidents have been evaluated and measures taken to reduce risks to personnel as far as is reasonably practicable. Much of the safety case depends on quantitative risk assessment to assess the effects of potential hazards to the installation and the personnel onboard; however, there is another side to risk estimates, namely the 'qualitative' or subjective risk perceptions of the people who work and live offshore and are actually involved in hazardous offshore operations. These subjective perceptions of risk form the basis for risk acceptance, regardless of the objective or quantified risk, and, as such, they are important for understanding feelings of safety, attitudes to safety, risk-taking behaviour and accident involvement amongst the workforce. The present review considers psychological studies of offshore workers on UK and Norwegian installations and discusses how working environment and socio-organizational factors can affect risk perception and attitudes to safety, and ultimately risk-taking behaviour and accident involvement, within this unique and specialized work group.",,,,,,,,,65,4,0,0,3,1,79,,,0950-4230,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1995-09-01,WOS:A1995TG93700006,,

For the field study, 1688 juveniles (mean shell length: 15.29 mm) were released to an artificial reef which was constructed with 50 L-shaped concrete blocks covering an area of 20 m2, and the number of individuals remained in the reef were monitored for about five months. After release, the number decreased rapidly; 10 days later, only 339 (20.1% to the total number released), and about 3 months later only 12 individuals (0.7%) were found in the reef. After that, without much change in number, the reef kept quite a low density of the released juvenile population. Such rapid decrease and low density were examined in relation to the biological and physical conditions in and around the released site. The main cause appeared to be attributed to the lack of adequate micro-habitats for the juveniles, as the reef was constructed in the area under the strong influence of sand which was well indicated by the vegetation of Sargassum ringgoldianum growing predominantly in this sandy condition. For the indoor observation on the diurnal activity pattern of juvenile abalones, 50 individuals were placed in the experimental tank with a shelter, and then records were taken, at regular intervals, for the number of individuals remaining outside the shelter in two consecutive days. Most of the individuals stayed within the shelter with little sign of their activity during the daytime, but as soon as the darkness comes they started to move out of the shelter. Three to four hours later the number of juveniles outside the shelter reached a maximum in the day, and thereafter decreased towards the dawn. Thus, they clearly showed the nocturnal habit in activity. The predation upon juvenile abalones was examined for eight species of animals which commonly occurred in the place where the field experiment was undertaken. Of these, a starfish Coscinasterias acutispina, and two crabs Thalamita prymna and Etisus electra, were observed to prey on juvenile abalones. The damage to the shells differed among the predators examined, and the killed juveniles found at the released site also exhibited various degrees of shell damage. It was inferred that the predation would partly be responsible for an abrupt decline in the number of the released juveniles. Based on the results obtained not only in this study but also previous works by various authors, the ecological features of H. discus discus at a juvenile stage were reviewed.",,,,,,,,,4,0,0,0,2,0,4,,,0042-3580,,,,,,,,,,,"OCEAN RES INST, UNIV TOKYO, MINAMIDAI 1-15-1, NAKANO-KU, TOKYO 164, JAPAN",,,,1988-01-01,BCI:BCI198886123117,,

As the large-scale tidal energy stations were deployed in Canada, the UK, China, Netherlands, France, and the US, concerns about its harm to the environment are growing. To address such issues, the Zhejiang area, one of the top tidal sites in the world, is taken as an example and a three-dimensional two-way-nested model was constructed. The embedded array of 5 turbines, 50 turbines, and 200 turbines are estimated to produce an average power of 0.9 MW, 7.8 MW, and 22.1 MW, respectively. The results show that currents are decelerated significantly downstream of the array, while accelerations are observed in the neighboring channel. Moreover, significant increases in tidal elevation are found in the small basins characterized by both deep water and great velocity deficits. Modifications to sediment transport are predicted through changes in the bed shear stress. Notably, disturbance from the turbines unlikely changes the locations of sediment erosion and deposition. However, considerable reductions in bed shear stress extending over 10 km downstream could potentially slow down the sediment transport rates. The presence of the turbine array also induces a more noticeable effect in the areas with more benign hydrodynamic conditions. Especially in the coastal waters, the relatively small bed shear stresses decrease greatly in percentage, reaching up to 40%.",,,,,,,,,20,2,0,0,1,0,21,,,0306-2619,1872-9118,,,,,,,,,,"Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Sch Naval Architecture Ocean & Civil Engn, Shanghai 200240, Peoples R ChinaShanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Multifunct Towing Tank, Shanghai 200240, Peoples R ChinaShanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Sch Oceanog, Shanghai 200240, Peoples R ChinaShanghai Jiao Tong Univ, State Key Lab Ocean Engn, Shanghai 200240, Peoples R ChinaShanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Collaborat Innovat Ctr Adv Ship & Deep Sea Explor, Shanghai 200240, Peoples R ChinaShanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Key Lab Hydrodynam, Minist Educ, Shanghai 200240, Peoples R ChinaUniv Michigan, Dept Naval Architecture & Marine Engn, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA",,,,2020-04-15,WOS:000519517700061,,

This marine heatwave and others have resulted in a heightened awareness of their potential impacts and prompted questions about if and when they may be predictable. Here, we use output from an ensemble of global climate forecast systems to document which aspects of the 2014-2016 CCS heatwave were predictable and how forecast skill, or lack thereof, relates to mechanisms driving the heatwave's evolution. We focus on four prominent SSTa changes within the 2014-2016 period: (i) the initial onset of anomalous warming in early 2014, (ii) a second rapid SSTa increase in late 2014, (iii) a sharp reduction and subsequent return of warm SSTa in mid-2015, and (iv) another anomalous warming event in early 2016. Models exhibited clear forecast skill for the first and last of these fluctuations, but not the two in the middle. Taken together with the state of knowledge on the dominant forcing mechanisms of this heatwave, our results suggest that CCS SSTa forecast skill derives from predictable evolution of pre-existing SSTa to the west (as in early 2014) and the south (as in early 2016), while the inability of models to forecast wind-driven SSTa in late 2014 and mid-2015 is consistent with the lack of a moderate or strong El Nino or La Nina event preceding those periods. The multi-model mean forecast consistently outperformed a damped persistence forecast, especially during the period of largest SSTa, and skillful CCS forecasts were generally associated with accurate representation of large-scale dynamics. Additionally, a large forecast ensemble (85 members) indicated elevated probabilities for observed SSTa extremes even when ensemble mean forecasts exhibited limited skill. Our results suggest that different types or aspects of marine heatwaves are more or less predictable depending on the forcing mechanisms at play, and events that are consistent with predictable ocean responses could inform ecosystem-based management of the ocean.",,,,,,,,,40,0,0,0,16,0,40,,,,2296-7745,,,,,,,,,,"NOAA, Southwest Fisheries Sci Ctr, Environm Res Div, Monterey, CA 93940 USANOAA, Earth Syst Res Lab, Phys Sci Div, Boulder, CO 80305 USANOAA, Southwest Fisheries Sci Ctr, Fisheries Resources Div, La Jolla, CA USAUniv Calif Santa Cruz, Inst Marine Sci, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USAUniv Colorado, Cooperat Inst Res Environm Sci, Boulder, CO 80309 USANOAA, Geophys Fluid Dynam Lab, Princeton, NJ USA",,,,2019-08-16,WOS:000479074500001,,

[NWSJEMS Technical Report No 16.],,,,,,,,i,"xii, 1-127",,,,,,,,,,,Book,2006,2006,"Agent-based modelling and the management strategy evaluation approach are increasingly popular techniques used in natural resource management. Agent-based modelling is a technique that is used in a variety of fields (spanning the sciences, social services, humanities and economics) while management strategy evaluation (MSE) is a decision support framework that can be extended from its single sector roots into the exploration of more interdisciplinary questions and issues. Tying the two together, by building agent-based models for use in MSE studies has immense potential for increasing the breadth of natural resource management questions that can usefully be considered with any degree of success. The MSE framework is centred upon an operating model made up of biophysical and resource exploitation sub-models (that attempts to capture the dynamics of the entire system to be managed). Combined with this operating model are sub-models that simulate the management processes (including simulation of observations, assessments, decision making and implementation). Together, these models attempt to represent how the ecosystem is effected, monitored and managed. This simulation approach provides a means for pinpointing key research areas and (potentially more importantly) highlighting performance tradeoffs between alternative management strategies across a range of management objectives in the face of uncertainty (Sainsbury, 1988; Sainsbury, 1991; Sainsbury et al. 1997; Punt et al. 2001; Fulton et al. 2006b). The track record of management strategy evaluation (which models each part of the resource-management loop) in single sector management is now fairly extensive (Butterworth & Punt, 1999; Sainsbury et al. 1997; Sainsbury et al. 2000; Punt et al. 2001); the record for agent-based resource modelling is not as long, but it is diverse. It is an exceptionally flexible modelling approach that is a useful tool for situations in which small scale or individual level variability may play a significant role in the outcome. This is the case in some natural resource questions and is increasingly the case as management issues have to span more questions (such as the fate of threatened, endangered or protected species). One disadvantage to the agent-based modelling technique is the computational overheads involved [long dash] this can make some large scale questions infeasible if pure decision based agents are used to represent all aspects of a system. New hybrid methods that tie classical dynamic (differential equation) models with decision based agents seem to be the best means of solving these dilemmas. NWS-InVitro is an example of just such a hybrid model. It simulates effects of human activity, such as fishing, tourism, and LNG or salt production on the regional ecosystem, and the response of the system to different management regimes. The model does not attempt to represent all ecosystem details, but focuses on the dominant system components, in this case the North West Shelf ecosystem of Australia. These include commercially valuable fish and crustaceans, sharks, turtles, benthic communities, seagrass and mangroves and with the major industries in the area [long dash] fisheries, shipping, oil and gas production, salt extraction, coastal development, port maintenance (such as dredging) and recreational activities, such as fishing. The remainder of this document details the formulation of NWS-InVitro.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,1921061804,,,,,,,,,,,,,2006-01-01,ZOOREC:ZOOR14503018352,,

In the present paper the theoretical investigation on the hydroelastic responses of VLFS deployed near islands and reefs has been presented. In addition, based on the pulsating source Green function, the high performance parallel fast computing techniques and other numerical methods, in solving large scale linear equations, have been introduced in the three-dimensional hydroelastic analysis package THAFTS.

Barriers to commercial-scale deployment of CCS include concerns regarding potential risks and financial liability related to human health, safety, the environment, and business interruption. Although the probability of a release may be small, prudent risk management requires estimates of the funds required to remediate or compensate for harm, should a release occur. The analytic tools exist to estimate dollar values of potential risks. Such estimates are a function of location, plant design (fuel source, technology), and must be estimated on a site-specific basis. This paper applies a stochastic Monte Carlo model (CCSvt Model) that estimates financial consequences arising from potential human health, safety, environmental and business interruption risks (events) associated with CCS, in light of their anticipated site-specific likelihood and magnitude. The authors contend that use of the CCSvt Model, and corresponding results, foster a best practice understanding of the potential risks and financial liabilities associated with proposed CCS projects. In the authors' view, the results of the CCSvt Model can contribute to a more productive public dialogue regarding CCS, improved siting of CCS projects, and ultimately support the commercial-scale deployment of CCS-technology. The authors conclude that the CCSvt Model is sufficiently flexible in design that it can be adapted to estimate damages distribution curves for myriad types of CCS projects, scaled for plant design and geographic location. As a proof of concept, the authors apply the CCSvt Model to the Alabama Gulf Coast-Plant Barry pilot project in Mobile, Alabama. (C) 2014 The Authors.

Three primary activities were originally identiﬁed with a fourth added during project review: Site mean-ﬂow and turbulence characterisation; Acquisition, processing and dissemination of data for the validation of numerical models; Recommendations on metocean instrumentation and monitoring parameters; Provision of data in a format suitable for archival and access by the offshore renewables Industry. The data comprises primarily velocity measurements acquired between June 2011 and October 2014 at the European Marine Energy Centre (EMEC) tidal test site, Orkney, UK. Measurements were obtained by multiple variants of sensor operating on the principle of acoustic Doppler velocimetry including geometrically diverging and single-beam acoustic Doppler Profilers (ADP) or Acoustic Doppler Current Profilers (ADCP) as they are commonly refered to. Measurements were acquired from the seabed around the tidal turbine and from instrumentation platforms designed and operated by the University of Edinburgh which were installed on the tidal turbine in collaboration with the turbine developer. ReDAPT was led by Alstom and included the University of Edinburgh (UoE), DNV-GL Renewable Advisory, EDF Energy, E.ON, Tidal Generation Ltd., Plymouth Marine Laboratory and the European Marine Energy Centre (EMEC). The project centred around a commercial scale (1MW) tidal turbine developed by Alstom deployed at EMECs Tidal Test Site with the aim of producing a comprehensive suite of data on turbine operation, the ﬂow ﬁeld and the interaction between the two.

Over 150 years of exploration has revealed that this dynamic system provides critical climate regulation, houses a wealth of energy, mineral, and biological resources, and represents a vast repository of biological diversity. A long history of deep-ocean exploration and observation led to the initial concept for the Deep-Ocean Observing Strategy (DOOS), under the auspices of the Global Ocean Observing System (GOOS). Here we discuss the scientific need for globally integrated deep-ocean observing, its status, and the key scientific questions and societal mandates driving observing requirements over the next decade. We consider the Essential Ocean Variables (EOVs) needed to address deep-ocean challenges within the physical, biogeochemical, and biological/ecosystem sciences according to the Framework for Ocean Observing (FOO), and map these onto scientific questions. Opportunities for new and expanded synergies among deep-ocean stakeholders are discussed, including academic-industry partnerships with the oil and gas, mining, cable and fishing industries, the ocean exploration and mapping community, and biodiversity conservation initiatives. Future deep-ocean observing will benefit from the greater integration across traditional disciplines and sectors, achieved through demonstration projects and facilitated reuse and repurposing of existing deep-sea data efforts. We highlight examples of existing and emerging deep-sea methods and technologies, noting key challenges associated with data volume, preservation, standardization, and accessibility. Emerging technologies relevant to deep-ocean sustainability and the blue economy include novel genomics approaches, imaging technologies, and ultra-deep hydrographic measurements. Capacity building will be necessary to integrate capabilities into programs and projects at a global scale. Progress can be facilitated by Open Science and Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable (FAIR) data principles and converge on agreed to data standards, practices, vocabularies, and registries. We envision expansion of the deep-ocean observing community to embrace the participation of academia, industry, NGOs, national governments, international governmental organizations, and the public at large in order to unlock critical knowledge contained in the deep ocean over coming decades, and to realize the mutual benefits of thoughtful deep-ocean observing for all elements of a sustainable ocean.",,,,,,,,,145,4,0,0,78,1,155,,,,2296-7745,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Calif San Diego, Integrat Oceanog Div, Scripps Inst Oceanog, La Jolla, CA 92093 USAUniv Calif San Diego, Ctr Marine Biodivers & Conservat, Scripps Inst Oceanog, La Jolla, CA 92093 USANatl Oceanog Ctr, Ocean Biogeochem & Ecosyst Div, Southampton, Hants, EnglandUniv Texas Austin, Oden Inst Computat Engn & Sci, Inst Geophys, Austin, TX 78712 USAUniv Hawaii Manoa, Dept Ocean & Resources Engn, Honolulu, HI 96822 USAHelmholtz Ctr Polar & Marine Res, Deep Sea Ecol & Technol Grp, Alfred Wegener Inst, Bremerhaven, GermanyUniv Corp Atmospher Res, Cooperat Programs Adv Earth Syst Sci, Boulder, CO USAMonterey Bay Aquarium Res Inst, Moss Landing, CA USAMem Univ Newfoundland, Dept Ocean Sci, St John, NF, CanadaMem Univ Newfoundland, Dept Biol, St John, NF, CanadaUniv Calif San Diego, Geol Data Ctr, Scripps Inst Oceanog, La Jolla, CA 92093 USAUniv Glasgow, Inst Biodivers Anim Hlth & Comparat Med, Glasgow, Lanark, ScotlandUniv Calif San Diego, Scripps Inst Oceanog, Marine Phys Lab, La Jolla, CA 92093 USANOAA, Off Ocean Explorat & Res, Silver Spring, MD USALouisiana State Univ, Dept Oceanog & Coastal Sci, Coll Coast & Environm, Baton Rouge, LA 70803 USAUniv Technol Sydney, Sch Life Sci, Sydney, NSW, AustraliaUniv Acores, Inst Mar, Marine & Environm Sci Ctr, Ctr OKEANOS, Horta, PortugalNOAA, Pacific Marine Environm Lab, 7600 Sand Point Way Ne, Seattle, WA 98115 USASydney Inst Marine Sci, New South Wales Dept Primary Ind, Mosman, NSW, AustraliaMiddlebury Inst Int Studies Monterey, IUCN Global Marine & Polar Programme, Monterey, CA USAJapan Agcy Marine Earth Sci & Technol, Yokosuka, Kanagawa, JapanUniv Washington, Sch Oceanog, Seattle, WA 98195 USASorbonne Univ, Observ Oceanol Banyuls, CNRS, Banyuls Sur Mer, FranceUniv Calif San Diego, Dept Pediat, San Diego, CA 92103 USADeakin Univ, Ctr Integrat Ecol, Sch Life & Environm Sci, Burwood, Vic, AustraliaAustralian Inst Marine Sci, Indian Ocean Marine Res Ctr, Crawley, WA, AustraliaUniv Geneva, Dept Genet & Evolut, Geneva, SwitzerlandUniv Hawaii, Sch Ocean & Earth Sci & Technol, Dept Oceanog, Honolulu, HI 96822 USAChinese Acad Sci, Inst Oceanol, Qingdao, Shandong, Peoples R ChinaNatl Inst Ocean Technol, Chennai, Tamil Nadu, IndiaWoods Hole Oceanog Inst, Woods Hole, MA 02543 USA",Middlebury Inst Int Studies Monterey,,,2019-05-29,WOS:000469301800001,,

Liver and bile samples were analyzed for PAHs and their metabolites using triple quadrupole mass spectrometry (GC/MS/MS) and high-performance liquid chromatography with fluorescence detection (HPLC-F), respectively. Data were compared among species and sub-regions of the GoM to understand spatiotemporal exposure dynamics in these economically and ecologically important species. Significant differences in the composition and concentrations of PAHs were detected spatially, over time and by species. The West Florida Shelf, Cuba coast and the Yucatan Shelf had a greater proportion of the pyrogenic PAHs in their livers than the other regions likely due to non-oil industry related sources (e.g., marine vessel traffic) in the regional composition profiles. Mean liver PAH concentrations were highest in the north central region of the GoM where DWH occurred. Biliary PAH concentrations and health indicator biometrics initially decrease during the first three years following the DWH oil spill but significantly increased thereafter. Increased exposures are likely explained by the resuspension of residual DWH oil as well as continued inputs from natural (e.g., seeps) sources and other anthropogenically derived sources (e.g., riverine runoff, other oil spills, and leaking oil and gas infrastructure). The increasing trend in PAH concentrations in the bile and liver of grouper species in the north central region of the GoM post-DWH suggest continued chronic exposures, however the critical stage at which permanent, irreparable damage may occur is unknown. Long-term monitoring of PAH levels and associated fish health biomarkers is necessary to evaluate impacts of chronic exposures, particularly in regions subject to intensive oil extraction activities.

Three muster scenarios of varying severity (man overboard, gas release, and fire and explosion) were studied in detail. A panel of 24 judges active in the offshore oil and gas industry provided data for both the weighting and rating of six performance shaping factors. These data were subsequently processed by means of SLIM to calculate the probability of success for 18 muster actions ranging from point of muster initiator to the final actions in the temporary safe refuge (TSR).

This paper presents the results analyses of particular hypothetical oil spill scenario in Khark offshore oilfield which is one of the oldest discovered oil fields in Persian Gulf. Simulation of oil spill was carried out using MIKE21 model. After completion of simulation, it is safe to say that wind will play a vital role in advection and spreading of the oil slick in the sea. Tidal currents in the Persian Gulf have a Reciprocating motion which causes oil slick does not go far away. So, currents have negligible effect on advection and spreading of oil. The vast majority of spilled oil was evaporated in the first few days following a spill. The oil will pollute the marine environment by dispersing it in the water column and sedimentation on the sea floor. At last, the results of MIKE21 model lend support to the fact that they are in good agreement with field observation and it would be a golden key to prepare a practical contingency planning to combat against destructive effects of oil pollution on marine environment.",,,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,1,0,2,,,2538-5542,2538-2705,,,,,,,,,,"Islamic Azad Univ, Cent Tehran Branch, Tehran, IranIslamic Azad Univ, Cent Tehran Branch, Water Engn, Tehran, IranUniv Garmsar, Civil Engn, Semnan, Iran",Univ Garmsar,,,2017-12-01,WOS:000453146000001,,

In addition to this, tuffs, tuff-sandstones, and crystalline schists (quartzites) were studied separately. The lasts were marked only in the Permian Basin. The comparative analysis of the sedimentary basins located in the peripheral parts of the North American and South American platforms showed the following: the most important stage in the evolution of the North American platform is the first stage of existence of the ancient Paleozoic continental margins, which developed under passive tectonic conditions and determined its future potential of oil and gas bearing. At this stage, the main resources of oil and gas hydrocarbons are concentrated in carbonate rocks. As for the sedimentary basins located on the margins of the South American platform, the second stage is the most important stage in their evolution when the foredeeps were formed and developed laying on the earlier structures. This period is related to the oil and gas bearing potential of the basins on the margins of the South American platform. For both platforms, a common circumstance is that, at the second stage of development of all the sedimentary basins, all the resources of hydrocarbons are focused in the terrigeneous sediments.The stratigraphic range of oil and gas occurrence in the basins of the ancient continental margins is determined by the following regularity: the fold structures is younger confining these margins, the age range of the oil and gas reservoirs is broader.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,0001-4370,1531-8508,,,,,,,,,,"Russian Acad Sci, Shirshov Inst Oceanol, Moscow, Russia",,,,2015-05-13,WOS:000353336100014,,

The major sources of oil discharges are run-off, oil spills, natural seepage, blowouts, vessel operations, leaky submerged pipelines, and offshore oil and gas operations. An accurate or reliable assessment of the effects of oil on the marine environment is one of the vital issues involved in making environmental management decisions. This research focuses on the environmental fate and likely consequences of toxic oil compounds as considered from the marine management perspective. Predictive models have now been produced for the assessment of risk associated with oil spills. Following the evaluation of existing popular models, the fugacity model was selected for a simulation exercise in this study. To provide a better perspective on the potential impacts of oil released into the environment, the likely behaviours of the oils are analysed and presented pictorially. Two toxic compounds of oil, benzo[a]pyrene and pyrene, were tested using the fugacity model. Their transformation in the air, water, soil, and sediment, and accumulation in fish and suspended particles was determined for environmental conditions similar to that found in Canada's Atlantic region. In analysing the results and considering the limitations of the fugacity model, the use of an additional food chain based model component was proposed as a means to overcome its shortcomings.

Natural attenuation, biostimulation, and bioaugmentation are all biological soil treatment techniques that can be adapted to mangroves. Our experiments were performed on samples of fresh mangrove sediments from the Cameroon estuary and mainly from the Wouri River in Cameroon. This study aims to assess the degradation potential of a bacterial consortium isolated from mangrove sediment. The principle of our bioremediation experiments is based on a series of tests designed to evaluate the potential of an active indigenous microflora and three exogenous pure strains, to degrade diesel with/without adding nutrients. The experiments were conducted in laboratory flasks and a greenhouse in microcosms. In one case, as in the other, the endogenous microflora showed that it was able to degrade diesel. Under stress of the pollutant, the endogenous microflora fits well enough in the middle to enable metabolism of the pollutant. However, the Rhodococcus strain was more effective over time. The degradation rate was 77 and 90% in the vials containing the sterile sediments and non-sterile sediments, respectively. The results are comparable with those obtained in the microcosms in a greenhouse where only the endogenous microflora were used. The results of this study show that mangrove sediment contains an active microflora that can metabolize diesel.

However, few studies have focused on this field due to the limitation of the available release devices. Based on the newly developed protective device release method, the behavior of Sebastes schlegelii ( (4. 5 [plus or minus] 0. 5) cm body length; (3. 5 [plus or minus] 0. 5) g body weight) in an experimental watertank with and without (control group) artificial reef models was observed after releasing. The distribution pattern of S. schlegelii was recorded and compared with those under the chute and the direct release methods. Observations demonstrated that the number of juveniles released to the designated area by protective device method was significantly larger than that of other two methods, and the distribution rate of S. schlegelii in the artificial reef area was higher than that of control. Results implicated that the protective device can help to mitigate the stress response of S. schlegelii, and achieve the high locating accuracy of release.

Our ability to monitor the marine soundscape using passive acoustic technology is important to determine the potential impacts of anthropogenic sound. The objectives of this workshop were to define our current capabilities with regard to passive acoustic monitoring (PAM); to define our current state of knowledge of the marine soundscape, and of underwater noise in particular, and of noise impacts; to identify the needs and concerns of the various stakeholders; and to determine future research and development needs. The workshop was held in Fremantle, Western Australia, on 21 November 2012, the day before the Australian Acoustical Society's annual conference. Three tutorial sessions were presented by leading researchers in the field on underwater acoustic terminology, metrics, the basics of sound propagation, noise modelling and prediction, the marine soundscape (physical ambient, anthropogenic and biological sources), sound recording technology and methods, noise impacts on marine fauna, mitigation and environmental management. Tutorials were followed by rapid-fire presentations of current research associated with the themes of passive acoustic monitoring and noise impact. Discussions pursued on the presented topics, with emphasis on stakeholder needs, prevailing problems, knowledge gaps, potential solutions and future initiatives. The workshop was attended by over 70 participants from within Australia and abroad, hosting a diverse range of expertise and representing the various stakeholders in the marine environment: the offshore oil and gas industry, consulting industry, fishing industry, defence, government (environmental officers, regulators, fisheries officers), environmental groups and academia. The outcomes of the workshop were:An appreciation of PAM for monitoring of marine fauna, for ecological studies, for measurements of anthropogenic noise, for studying noise impacts and for mitigation monitoring;A demonstration of the effectiveness of PAM for presence and abundance monitoring (with more acoustic detections than visual in certain circumstances);An understanding of the limitations of PAM (to vocalising animals) and the potential of combining PAM with visual observations and possibly active acoustic imaging to increase detection probability;An appreciation of the differences between regulatory approaches in different jurisdictions;The identification of the need to monitor (and address noise impacts on) entire ecosystems including less iconic (=non-mammalian) species;The identification of knowledge gaps with regards to unidentified sounds in marine soundscapes, natural variability in soundscapes with space and time necessitating long-term baseline recording, noise impacts on the vast majority of marine species, anthropogenic source signatures and sound transmission.",,,,,,,,,14,0,0,0,12,0,15,,,0814-6039,,,,,,,,,,,"Curtin Univ, Ctr Marine Sci & Technol, Perth, WA 6845, Australia",,,,2014-03-26,WOS:000331666700017,,

The next phase will see these wave and tidal devices deployed in arrays, with many sites being developed. Although developers have entered into agreements with The Crown Estate for seabed leases, all projects remain subject to licensing requirements under the Marine Scotland Act (2010).As part of the licensing arrangements, environmental effects in the immediate vicinity of devices and arrays will be addressed in the EIA (Environmental Impact Assessment) process that each developer must undertake. It is essential, however, that the regulatory authorities understand how a number of multi-site developments collectively impact on the physical and biological processes over a wider region, both in relation to cumulative effects of the developments and marine planning responsibilities. At a regional scale, careful selection of sites may enable the optimum exploitation of the resource while minimising any environmental impacts to an acceptable level.The TeraWatt Consortium has been established through the auspices of The Marine Alliance for Science & Technology for Scotland (MASTS) with Heriot-Watt University, and the Universities of Edinburgh, Glasgow, Strathclyde, the Highlands and Islands and Marine Scotland Science (MSS). The consortium has the support and anticipates the full engagement of the marine renewable developers in many aspects of the work. The research programme has been designed to specifically respond to questions posed by Marine Scotland Science, the organisation responsible for providing scientific advice to the licensing authority. In particular to the following questions: (1) What is the best way to assess the wave and tidal resource and the effects of energy extraction on it? (2) What are the physical consequences of wave and tidal energy extraction? (3) What are the ecological consequences of wave and tidal energy extraction? The overarching objective of the research is to generate a suite of methodologies that can provide better understandings of, and be used to assess, the alteration of the resource from energy extraction, and of the physical and ecological consequence. Illustration of the use of these in key development area, such as the Pentland Firth and Orkney Waters, and their availability as tools will enable the acceleration of array deployments.The TeraWatt research programme is structured in 4 workstreams. The first, led by MSS, will collate all necessary data to be used, develop the hypothetical multi-site array configurations in conjunction with developers and evaluate acceptance criteria for impacts. The second led by Edinburgh University will use separate and coupled models of wave and tide at a resolution necessary to consider multi-site array effects on the resource, providing important inputs to workstreams 3 and 4 which will address in turn, the spatial changes in physical processes affecting sediments, the shoreline and seabed (led by Glasgow and Strathclyde), and the spatial changes affecting organisms living in the seabed, their distribution and the significance of these for other ecological processes (led by Heriot-Watt University). Each workstream will provide reviews of the methodologies used which will be synthesised into a single methods toolbox. Where possible all regional scale modelling, used to illustrate these methodologies, will be validated by field data and the consortium has assembled both existing and data not previously available, for this purpose with the support of MSS and marine renewable developers. The TeraWatt project, which will be managed by MASTS, envisages direct participation from industry in various aspects of its work, and has a number of wider knowledge exchange and stakeholder engagement activities planned.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,EP/J010170/1,,,,,,,,Heriot-Watt University,,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:15413114,,

The salt was deposited in the Late Carboniferous-Early Permian and has been remobilised several times. Upper Palaeozoic and Mesozoic sediments filled in the basin and were uplifted by salt diapirism in the Early/Middle Triassic, Late Jurassic, Late Cretaceous and Tertiary. Regional uplift and erosion in the Early Tertiary and extensive glacial erosion in the Late Pliocene/Pleistocene removed up to 1200 in of the Mesozoic and Cenozoic strata and left them heavily tilted and truncated around the salt diapirs, only covered by a thin sheet of glacial sediments.During much of the Triassic and Jurassic the Nordkapp Basin was a large mariner embayment. open to the ocean in the southwest. This allowed deposition of potential hydrocarbon source rocks in anoxic basins during transgressive periods in the Triassic and Late Jurassic. Coastal processes improved the reservoir quality of Upper Triassic to Middle Jurassic sands during regressive periods. One exploration well within the basin and three wells surrounding the basin have produced oil shows, but no commercial discoveries have been made so far. During the review period of the present paper. an exploration well encountered oil and gas in Triassic sandstones in the southwestern segment of the basin.

However, most biomass and carbon measurements have been conducted in coastal and delta mangroves, while oceanic mangroves are still insufficiently researched. In this paper we present results from our research on the Karimunjawa archipelago in the Java Sea north of Central Java, Indonesia, where we measured soil carbon stocks (soil total organic carbon - TOC) of an oceanic mangrove ecosystem. In previous research, we had already analyzed above-ground carbon (AGC) and below-ground biomass carbon (BGBC), so that we are now able to present the total ecosystem carbon stock. We took 35 soil samples along seven transects to analyze the relationship between (a) soil TOC and distance from shoreline, (b) total ecosystem carbon stock (AGC + BGBC + soil TOC) and distance from shoreline, (c) total C of living biomass (AGC + BGBC) and distance from shoreline, as well as (d) soil TOC and living biomass. We took another nine soil samples to analyze the distribution of soil TOC in the soil profile at a greater resolution. Our results show that there is a wide range of soil carbon stocks that varies from 3.3 t C ha(-1) to 366.7 t C ha(-1). On average of the 35 samples soils contribute to 45.5% of the total ecosystem carbon stock. Overall there is no correlation between the analyzed variables. However, there is a correlation between distance from the shoreline and soil carbon stock for the longest transect and a strong relationship between soil depth and soil carbon stock for all samples.

The Special Report, being written in 2003-2005, reflected the relatively early nature of development of regulations pertaining to CCS and, in particular, geologic storage. The principle area of focus in the Special Report was marine treaties - namely the Convention for the Protection of the Marine Environment of the North-East Atlantic (OSPAR) and the London Convention - as they had been the focus of prior legal analysis and the parties to the treaties had begun their own consideration of the topic. Both marine treaties proceeded to remove their prohibitions on CO2 geological storage, the London Convention in 2006 and OSPAR in 2007 (IMO, 2006a; OSPAR, 2007c). Another significant influence at this time was the work being undertaken to develop a CCS-focused chapter in the IPCC Guidelines for GHG Inventories (IPCC, 2006a). These guidelines set out how to undertake and report the GHG performance of CCS, creating a methodology for geological storage assessment and report that became the basis for subsequent CCS regulations. In the years following, there were numerous developments at the national and regional levels. For example, the EU CCS Directive was developed in 2007 and 2008 (EC, 2009a), to create an enabling framework for CCS, to remove barriers and allow it to proceed but also to ensure environmental protection. The Directive was adopted in 2009, along with a revision of the EU's Emission Trading Directive (EC, 2009a) which brought CCS into the EU's emissions trading scheme. CCS-specific laws and regulations have also been established at both the federal and state levels in the United States, and the commonwealth and state levels in Australia. The other major development in international law and regulations since the Special Report is the inclusion of CCS into the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) under the UNFCCC's Kyoto Protocol. This took several years, from 2005 to 2011, but in 2011 a new set of rules specific to CCS were developed and adopted which allows CCS to be a legitimate project activity under the CDM for developing countries to use (UNFCCC, 2011b). It is widely anticipated that future mechanisms developed under the UNFCCC and allowing CCS will follow the principles established by these CCS CDM modalities and procedures. These international developments potentially impact 180 countries. This paper provides a descriptive review of the key legal and regulatory developments since 2005, with a particular focus on the international developments. It also briefly reviews the application of permitting regimes to new CCS projects in the US and EU (Netherlands). (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

In this study we measured total cyanobacterial hepatotoxin levels in blue mussel (Mytilus edulis) and flounderi (Platichthys flesus) tissues. Flounder were caught with gillnets from the western Gulf of Finland during July and August 1999. Blue mussels were collected from an enclosure at 3 m depth and from an artificial reef (wreck, 25-35 m depth) in the western Gulf of Finland between June and September 1999. Flounder liver and muscle samples and soft tissues of mussels were analyzed for the cyanobacterial hepatotoxins (nodularin, NODLN and/or microcystins, MCs) using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Results showed a time-dependent accumulation of hepatotoxins in flounder and mussels. In flounder, the maximum concentration 399 +/- 5 (sd) ng NODLN or MC/g dry weight (dw) was found in the liver of specimens caught on 21 August 1999. No hepatotoxins were detected in muscle samples. The maximum concentration of 2150 ng +/- 60 (sd) ng hepatotoxin/g dw was found in the mussel soft tissues collected on 20 August 1999. Temporal NODLN or MC trends indicated depuration of cyanobacterial hepatotoxin from mussels at surface level and an increase in NODLN or MC concentrations in those from the sea bed. These studies showed that despite the low cyanobacteria cell numbers the cyanobacterial hepatotoxins can accumulate in flounder and mussels. This may allow the further transfer of cyanobacterial hepatotoxins in the food web.

In order to understand how these complex systems will respond to future climate forcing, further studies of nutrient input, biological production and export are needed. Using a Be-7-based approach, we produced an 18-month record of upwelling velocity estimates at the San Pedro Ocean Time-series (SPOT), Southern California Bight. These upwelling rates and vertical nutrient distributions have been combined to make estimates of potential new production (PNP), which are compared to estimates of net community oxygen production (NOP) made using a one-dimensional, two-box non-steady state model of euphotic zone biological oxygen supersaturation. NOP agrees within uncertainty with PNP, suggesting that upwelling is the dominant mechanism for supplying the ecosystem with new nutrients in the spring season, but negligible in the fall and winter. Combining this data set with estimates of sinking particulate organic carbon (POC) flux from water column Th-234:U-238 disequilibrium and sediment trap deployments, and an estimate of the ratio of dissolved organic carbon (DOC):POC consumption rates, we construct a simple box model of organic carbon in the upper 200 m of our study site. This box model (with uncertainties of +/- 50%) suggests that in spring, 28% of net production leaves the euphotic zone as DOC, of this, similar to 12% as horizontal export and 16% via downward mixing. The remaining similar to 72% of net organic carbon export exits as sinking POC, with only 10% of euphotic zone export reaching 200 m. We find the metabolic requirement for the local heterotrophic community below the euphotic zone, but above 200 m, is similar to 105 +/- 50 mmol C m(-2) d(-1), or similar to 80% of net euphotic zone production in spring.

Hypotheses were tested to distinguish between (i) the overall effect of oil spills, (ii) the effect of diesel dosage via different exposure regimes, and (iii) the effect of time since last spill. Repeated oil spills dramatically altered the overall structure of assemblages and reduced the total density of macrofauna and densities of dominant taxa. Increasing the frequency of oil spills negatively affected macrofauna. In general, frequent low-dosage oil spills were more deleterious than infrequent high-dosage ones. However, increases in densities of some taxa, mainly the gastropod Heleobia australis, were observed in response to infrequent spills.

In the subsurface, erosion surface E5 is associated with major oil and gas fields and is penetrated by thousands of wells. A topographic map of E5, based on 6126 well logs and over 1100 measured cores, shows a series of subparallel elongate highs (steps) and lows which trend northwest-southeast, parallel to tectonic trends and to the actively rising cordillera to the southwest. The steps are about 10 km apart, and the relative relief, step to adjacent low, is up to 25 m. The steps are asymmetrical, with a steeper face to the northeast. The E5 erosion surface cuts into offshore marine hummocky cross-stratified sandstones and interbedded mudstones, and it records a lowering of relative sea level. Our interpretation suggests that erosion was in neither a fully subaqueous nor a fully subaerial environment. Instead, it involved relative sea-level lowering and subaerial erosion, followed by major modification of the landscape during transgressive shoreface erosion. At times of relative stillstand during overall transgression, gravel was supplied to the shoreface and was reworked a short distance alongshore by waves. These conglomerates now form important oil and gas reservoirs. The asymmetry of the steps and lows indicates that the originally flat sea floor was tilted northeastward immediately before erosion, giving a gradient of about 1:1000. During transgression, shorefaces were incised into the tilted surface to form a stepped morphology. Also during transgression, the sea floor was gradually restored to its pre-tilting position.

To date, studies of ecological effects on coastal fishes have produced complex results. While laboratory studies indicate that oil has widespread, pervasive impacts on fish physiology, field assessments often document few impacts to fish abundance and biomass following a spill. The dichotomy of such results suggests that negative individual-level effects do not translate to population/community- level consequences. One explanation for this discrepancy is that mobile organisms may avoid oil, which was very patchily distributed. Here, I present the results of experiments using 3 estuarine fishes (gulf killifish Fundulus grandis, sailfin molly Poecilia latipinna, and sheepshead minnow Cyprinodon variegatus) to determine whether behavioral avoidance occurs at a range of concentrations (0, 10, 20, and 40 ml oil l(-1) of sediment) and weathering (fresh or weathered oil) scenarios. All 3 species avoided medium (35, 18, 10% of trial time, respectively) and high concentrations of fresh oil (30, 20, and 15%, respectively), while time spent over contaminated sediments at low concentrations of fresh oil was higher (30, 40, and 40%, respectively). Weathered crude elicited no significant avoidance behavior, with fish occupying between 40 and 60% of the trial period over these sediments, regardless of concentration. This research highlights the heretofore unrecognized role of behavior in fish resilience, as well as the need for future studies to incorporate ecologically relevant weathering rates. Such results are critical to the successful management of motile resources, such as estuarine fishes, in response to anthropogenic disasters such as oil spills.",,,,,,,,,22,0,0,0,20,0,25,,,0171-8630,1616-1599,,,,,,,,,,"Louisiana State Univ, Dept Oceanog Coastal Sci, Baton Rouge, LA 70803 USAUniv Florida, Inst Food & Agr Sci, Nat Coast Biol Stn, Cedar Key, FL 32625 USA",,,,2017-08-03,WOS:000407443900010,,

The rate of biodiversity loss due to human activity in the last 50 years has been more rapid than at any other time in human history, and many of the drivers of biodiversity loss are increasing, including habitat loss, overexploitation, invasive species, climate change, and pollution, including pollution from reactive nitrogen (Nr). Of these stressors, climate change and Nr from anthropogenic activities are causing some of the most rapid changes. Climate change is causing warming trends that result in poleward and elevational range shifts of flora and fauna, and changes in phenology, particularly the earlier onset of spring events and migration, and lengthening of the growing season. Nitrogen (N) enrichment can enhance plant growth, but has been shown to favor, fast-growing, sometimes invasive, species over native species adapted to low N conditions. Although there have been only a few controlled studies on climate change and N interactions, inferences can be drawn from various field observations. For example, in arid ecosystems of southern California, elevated N deposition and changing precipitation patterns have promoted the conversion of native shrub communities to communities dominated by annual non-native grasses. Both empirical studies and modeling indicate that N and climate change can interact to drive losses in biodiversity greater than those caused by either stressor alone.

CO2 capture and storage technologies have been believed to be an expected countermeasure for reduction of the greenhouse gas released by plants and industrial activities. Recently, a new method for CO2 capture and storage has been proposed by some researchers, that is, CO2 sequestration in the form of CO2-hydrate under the seafloor. In this method, CO2 is injected into the sandy layer of seabed ground where the CO2-hydrate can exist stably. In order to achieve the safe and sustainable sequestration, it is essential to characterize the mechanical response such as stress-strain relationships or deformations of CO2-hydrate-bearing sandy sediments. In the present study, we have conducted a series of undrained triaxial compression tests on artificial CO2-hydrate-bearing sand specimens. From the experiment results, it is found that both stiffness and shear strength of CO2-hydrate-bearing sediments increase as increases in content of CO2-hydrates, and excess pore water pressure is reduced so that negative excess pore water pressure can be observed. The CO2-hydrates in the pore spaces seem to play a role of supporting the soil skeleton and it acts as additional sand particles which enhances the dilation behaviour of the sandy sediments.

Shorebirds mainly forage on intertidal mudflats at low tide. A key spring stopover for shorebirds in North America is Delaware Bay, New Jersey, where shorebirds feed on horseshoe crab (Limulus polyphemus) eggs at high tide. The importance of intertidal to migrant shorebirds has been overlooked. This paper examines foraging of 4 shorebird species at Reeds Beach, Delaware Bay. The intertidal zone was divided into an experimental array with oyster racks, artificial reefs, and controls to quantify the number of birds present in each section. The best models for all species (except sanderling, Calidris alba) explained over 60% of variation in number present as a function of other shorebirds, date, and treatment. Time of day was the only factor affecting the number of sanderlings. Date is a contributing factor because numbers are low in early May, peak by May 20-25th, and decrease in late May as shorebirds leave for the Arctic. Red knots (Calidris canutus rufa), tumstones (Arenaria interpres), and semipalmated sandpipers (Calidris pusilla) were present less often, and in smaller numbers in the oyster rack treatment (compared to the other treatments). There was a high association between foraging species. The data clearly show avoidance of the oyster racks by knots. tumstones and semipalmated sandpipers, but they did not avoid those with reefs or the control. These results are important because of the desire to expand aquaculture along the Delaware Bay into prime shorebird foraging areas. The Precautionary Principle dictates that the expansion of intertidal oyster culture be halted in areas of high foraging value for red knots (threatened in the US.) and other shorebirds until any effects on fitness are determined.

Currently over 50% of renewable power is generated from onshore wind with a large number of offshore wind projects in development. Recently the government has re-iterated its commitment to offshore wind power and has announced that offshore wind subsidies are to increase from 135 pound/MWh to 140 pound/MWh until 2019. This paper provides a detailed overview of the offshore wind power industry in the United Kingdom in terms of market growth, policy development and offshore wind farm costs. The paper clearly shows that the United Kingdom is the world leader for installed offshore wind power capacity as pro-active policies and procedures have made it the most attractive location to develop offshore wind farm arrays. The key finding is that the United Kingdom has the potential to continue to lead the world in offshore wind power as it has over 48 GW of offshore wind power projects at different stages of operation and development. The growth of offshore wind power in the United Kingdom has seen offshore wind farm costs rise and level off at approximately 3 million/MW, which are higher than onshore wind costs at 1.5-2 pound million/MW. Considering the recent increase in offshore wind power subsidies and plans for 48 GW of offshore wind power could see more offshore wind power becoming increasingly financially competitive with onshore wind power. Therefore offshore wind power is likely to become a significant source of electricity in the United Kingdom beyond 2020. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

J,,,,,,,,,,,OCE-PRF The impact of nitrogen loading and sea level rise on subsurface green house gas cycling and carbon sequestration in coastal salt marsh ecosystems,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Awarded Grant,Oct 01 2013,2013,"Overview: Salt marshes play a significant role in the climate feedback system. Salt marshes are efficient at carbon burial and emit greenhouse gases. Under predicted climate change, sea level rise will potentially alter the carbon burial capacity of these systems. Nutrient loading is an additional external stressor in these systems which may impact carbon and greenhouse gas cycling. In this project, the fellow will study the impact of sea level rise and nitrogen enrichment on subsurface cycling of greenhouse gases and carbon in salt marshes with Kevin D. Kroeger, PhD at the United States Geological Survey. The fellow plans to install a network of observing wells within a salt marsh system across nitrogen enrichment and inundation levels, and collect samples monthly for two years for dissolved carbon and nitrogen. In addition, she will quantify subsurface production of greenhouse gases in these salt marsh sediments with an installation of hydrophilic, gas permeable tubing attached to gas analyzers during the same monthly sampling. Measurements will be taken of porewater flux both within the salt marsh subsurface and out of the marsh to determine fluxes of these constituents to receiving estuarine waters and ultimately the coastal ocean. The study site exists in a sea level rise hot spot and, therefore, an ideal location to determine how enhanced rates of sea level rise over the past twenty-five years have changed carbon burial in salt marshes. Sediment cores will be collected from sites that undergo a range of nitrogen loadings and seawater inundation levels to synthesize the salt marsh carbon burial response through time to these two stressors (nutrient enrichment and sea level rise). Results from this study will further understanding of the potential climate impacts on the ecosystem services of salt marshes. Intellectual Merit: The earth is faced with a high CO2 future, with potential climate impacts resonating through global coastal ecosystems via increasing temperatures and rising sea level. Population growth in coastal regions places added stress on ecosystems via nutrient enrichment. Salt marshes are regions of high carbon burial, and as such their carbon storage potential is of interest to both the scientific community and to stakeholders making decisions about carbon remediation. The direct impact of climate change on salt marsh ecosystems is unknown, however, potentially significant. In addition to their ability to store carbon, salt marsh ecosystems also produce and emit greenhouse gases, such as methane and nitrous oxide. Research results from this project will help to determine if carbon burial in salt marshes will be resilient in the face of climate change and if the net impacts of greenhouse gas emissions will reduce or negate the value of salt marshes as a carbon sink. Broader Impacts: This project is synergistic with a larger established project evaluating surface greenhouse gas evasion and lateral carbon fluxes from salt marsh ecosystems across a gradient of nitrogen loading. A key component of this project is to use collaborative learning to transform the scientific results into useable products for policy makers and others interested in the economics of salt marsh ecosystem services. With this framework in place, the results of this work will be directly linked to coastal policy decisions regarding salt marshes. In addition, broadening participation educational opportunities are a significant component of this project. The second field season will include participation of an undergraduate student from the Woods Hole Partnership in Education Program. The student will conduct original research within the framework of this project and attend a national conference to present the findings of their research. The fellow will also serve as a lecturer and mentor in the Waquoit Bay National Estuarine Research Reserve Women in Science Program throughout the project.

The study of these reservoirs, following a sequence stratigraphic approach, is essential to predict their features and distribution within systems tracts forming high-frequency sequences, which in turn compose higher-rank systems tracts and sequences. A critical aspect to improve the exploitability of the reservoirs is their heterogeneity, which directly affects the volume of the reservoirs and determine internal compartmentalization. The heterogeneity can be primary, related to depositional processes influencing grain size and facies distribution, and secondary, related to diagenesis. In particular, the primary heterogeneity is referred to the fades variability from distal to proximal settings, to the accumulation of condensed shell beds, and to facies characteristics of bedsets, whereas the secondary heterogeneity derives from diagenetic processes at sequence stratigraphic surfaces and facies contacts, and within sandbodies. Both the distribution of reservoirs and their heterogeneity can be predicted following a high-resolution sequence stratigraphic approach. Ultimately, the integration of subsurface data with the analysis of outcrop analogs is essential to better understand the features of clastic shelf reservoirs and to develop 3D models of fluid migration.

This is the first known example of intralacustrine speciation within the genus Cyprinodon. Geological data from sediments and molecular-biological investigations of the species lead to the assumption that the flock evolved sympatrically during the last 8,000 years. Despite of their morphologically different appearance most of the species do not seem to be reproductively isolated. The presumed sister-species is C. artifrons, the only member of genus Cyprinodon living in the marine coastal habitats of Yucatan. Within this thesis six endemic species (C. beltrani, C. simus, C. labiosus, C. verecundus, C. maya, C. esconditus) were studied in respect to their trophic adaptations. For comparison of the endemic species to each other a hypothetical basal form is assumed similar to the sister species C. artifrons which colonized Laguna Chichancanab 8,000 years ago. The bony structure of the viscerocranium shows only slight differences between the Cyprinodon species of Laguna Chichancanab. If compared with C. artifrons the most distinctive character is the shape of the lower jaw C. beltrani, C. labiosus and C. verecundus show the highest similarities, whereas C. maya and C. esconditus have broader and lower-angled jaws. The characteristic fleshy lips of C. labiosus do not correspond to any osteological feature but it is supposed to have a function for tracking specific prey. Only C. simus shows marked divergence in the viscerocranium manifested in the vertical position of its lower jaw The morphological and anatomical findings seem to be genetically fixed and of polygene origin. The analysis of diet revealed for C. beltrani as for C. artifrons a gut content almost entirely composed of bottom sediments, furthermore called detritus. Both species show the same gut length. In contrast the guts of the other species are half in length. Despite of their morphological and anatomical differences C. beltrani and C. simus seem to feed in the same way. The other species show specific preferences for invertebrate prey: C. labiosus amphipods, C. verecundus bivalves, C. maya Ostracoda and gastropods, presumably found in the Chara-species, and C. esconditus benthic chironomid-larvae. However, all members of the species flock ingest a high percentage of detritus. According to SCHOENER's index the pairwise niche overlap is generally high compared to other species flocks. Here it varies from about 40 to 95 percent. Only C. maya is ecologically separated. This is right for C. verecundus too with exception of its higher overlap with C. labiosus. The generally high pairwise niche overlap is derived from the main diet component detritus and if present from the second important component composed of benthic invertebrates. The other fish species found in Laguna Chichancanab (Gambusia sexradiata, Astyanax fasciatus) take Anflug (insects wrecked on water surface) as their most important prey so they do not compete with the Cyprinodon species. Introduced cichlids of genus Oreochromis feed mainly on bottom sediments and overlap highly with the Cyprinodon species, but they seem to show no direct influence. Laboratory experiments with three of the endemic Cyprinodon species (C. beltrani, C. labiosus, C. maya) point to opportunistic non-specific feeding of casually found prey. But they do differ in preference of habitat and strategy of tracking prey. In an aquarium four different substrates (sand, gravel, plastic plant and blank bottom) were offered to the species. C. beltrani made the most feeding attempts in small grained sand, C. labiosus preferred coarse gravel. F1-Hybrids of both species show no difference between sandy and gravelled sediments. C. maya shows no preference for any bottom substrate, too, but was the only one making feeding attempts on the plastic plant. Furthermore it was observed that all species specifically differ in the way feeding attempts were made. As all specimens were hatched from aquarium in same conditions, the specific preferences as the feeding behaviour appear to be genetically fixed. Obviously habitat segregation within the Cyprinodon species flock took place.Within the Cyprinodon species-flock at least C. maya occupies its own trophic niche and is reproductively isolated. Further investigations should reveal if genetic exchange between the other species still exists. If this is true in Chichancanab pupfish they should be considered as eco-types of a polymorphic species or phylogenetic species.",,,,,,,,,2,0,0,0,2,0,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2005-01-01,ZOOREC:ZOOR14201004591,,

The paper discusses some key research and new practices which led to the fabrication of related equipment which was evaluated in the trial. The market for deepwater drilling in the world has grown over the past 10 years but there are few drilling vessels or platforms suitable for drilling in deepwater or super deepwater. China needs equipment capable of deepwater drilling operations. COSL has some semisubmersible platforms, but they are only considered suitable for operations in water depths less than 475 m. An enabling technology, referred to as an artificial seabed, has been under development by COSL since 2004, and it applies the research results and experiences of many experts in deepwater drilling. COSL hopes this technology will allow drilling to depths of approximately 1 000 similar to 1 500 m with its current platforms. The paper presents research progress and improvements in fabrication and necessary upgrades to equipment for extending deepwater drilling. The pretrial well was executed at a water depth of nearly 500 m.

Such feedbacks have typically been quantified in the context of natural ecosystems, but land management activities are also responsive to future atmospheric carbon and climate changes. Here we show that inclusion of such human-driven responses within an Earth system model shifts both the terrestrial concentration-carbon and climate-carbon feedbacks toward increased carbon storage. We introduce a conceptual framework for decomposing these changes into separate concentration-land cover, climate-land cover, and land cover-carbon effects, providing a parsimonious means to diagnose sources of variation across numerical models capable of estimating such feedbacks.Plain Language Summary Estimating future changes to the Earth's climate requires an understanding of how carbon stored in vegetation and soils will respond to higher carbon dioxide in the atmosphere and changes in climate such as warmer temperatures and changes in precipitation. For instance, if plants and soils release more carbon, this will accelerate human-driven climate change, which is known as a positive feedback. Because climate change and higher atmospheric carbon dioxide will affect crop and forestry yields, we expect humans to alter their land management activities in the future, leading to greater or lesser storage of carbon in soils and vegetation. Higher crop yields could lead to less crop area globally and greater storage of carbon in forests and other natural vegetation. In this study, we introduce a method for quantifying such human influences on carbon storage, combining a model of land management with a model of atmospheric, land, and ecosystem processes. We find that both higher atmospheric carbon dioxide and climate change tend to reduce the footprint of human agriculture and therefore increase carbon storage on the land. Our method for quantifying such feedbacks provides a simple means to compare across models and identify areas of agreement or disagreement.",,,,,,,,,8,0,0,0,0,0,8,,,0094-8276,1944-8007,,,,,,,,,,"Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Berkeley, CA 94720 USAPacific Northwest Natl Lab, College Pk, MD USAOak Ridge Natl Lab, Oak Ridge, TN USAUniv Calif Berkeley, Dept Earth & Planetary Sci, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA",,,,2018-12-28,WOS:000451510500065,,

In July 2014 the European Parliament and Council established a Guideline Framework for marine/maritime spatial planning (MSP). MSP is a useful and cost-effective tool for sustainable development, together with regulation and protection of the marine environment. Within this context, Romania has started to proceed and incorporate kin the national legislation framework; in 2017, it has also established a competent authority for its implementation so that marine spatial plans can be enacted by 31 March 2021. In this study, a first approach for MSP framework in Romania was developed, enabling the mapping of all current human activities related to shipping, oil and gas exploitation, fisheries, tourism and environmental status, in order to identify overlaps or potential conflicts among users. This paper identifies key challenges and concerns anticipated to emerge from incorporation of MSP in the national spatial planning framework as it is currently organized: a) Romanian stakeholders have a relatively poor understanding of European, national and regional sea planning regulations, b) concerns related to MSP implementation at regulatory level, c) huge need for sharing of MSP-relevant information for a coherent planning, d) challenges of assessing the needs of interconnected ecosystems (including relevant EU and international legislation). In this context, our study covers highly actual aspects concerning the way the marine spatial planning process evolves and will contribute to deliver a coherent approach to reduce conflicts of the Romanian marine environment, a proper MSP implementation, as well as minimizing the pressures and impacts on the marine resources.",,,,,"International Conference on Maritime Spatial Planning, Ecosystem Approach and Supporting Information Systems (MaPSIS)International Conference on Maritime Spatial Planning, Ecosystem Approach and Supporting Information Systems (MaPSIS)","APR 24-28, 2017APR 24-28, 2017",,"Las Palmas de Gran Canaria, SPAINLas Palmas de Gran Canaria, SPAIN",15,0,0,0,2,0,15,,,0964-5691,1873-524X,,,,,,,,,,"Ovidius Univ Constanta, Fac Nat Sci & Agr Sci, 124 Mamaia Blv, Constanta, RomaniaUniv Bucharest, Interdisciplinary Ctr Adv Res Terr Dynam, 4-12 Regina Elisabeta Blv, Bucharest, Romania",,,,2018-12-28,WOS:000452576300007,,

When spilled oil and sediment interact, they can form either small microscopic aggregates, commonly referred to as oil-particle aggregates, or large macroscopic agglomerates, referred to as sediment-oil agglomerates or sediment-oil mats. Although these different sized oil-sediment residues have similar compositions, they are formed under different conditions and have different fates in nearshore environments; the goal of this review is to synthesize our current understanding of these two types of residues. We believe that researchers who focus solely on studying either microscopic aggregates or macroscopic agglomerates could benefit from understanding the research findings available in the other field. In this study, we compare and contrast various processes that control the formation, fate, and impacts of these two types of residues in nearshore environments and point out some of the knowledge gaps in this field. Additionally, these residues have been referred to by many names in the past, leading to confusion and misconceptions at times. In this effort, we recommend a uniform nomenclature to distinguish them based on their physical size. Our overall aim is to bridge the gap between microscopic and macroscopic oil-sediment residue literature to foster a robust exchange of ideas, which we believe can lead to the development of efficient strategies for managing oil spills that affect nearshore environments.",,,,,,,,,59,1,0,0,42,1,66,,,,1944-9208,,,,,,,,,,"Auburn Univ, Dept Civil Engn, Environm Engn Program, Auburn, AL 36849 USAUniv Alabama, Dept Civil Construct & Environm Engn, Tuscaloosa, AL 35487 USA",,,,2018-02-02,WOS:000423198800007,,

Hereby, UCG produces a high-calorific synthesis gas that can be used for generation of electricity, fuels, and chemical feedstock. The present study aims to identify economically-competitive, site-specific end-use options for onshore- and offshore-produced UCG synthesis gas, taking into account the capture and storage (CCS) and/or utilization (CCU) of produced CO2. Modeling results show that boundary conditions favoring electricity, methanol, and ammonia production expose low costs for air separation, low compression power requirements, and appropriate shares of H-2/N-2. Hereby, a gasification agent ratio of more than 30% oxygen by volume is not favorable from the economic and CO2 mitigation viewpoints. Compared to the costs of an offshore platform with its technical equipment, offshore drilling costs are marginal. Thus, uncertainties related to parameters influenced by drilling costs are negligible. In summary, techno-economic process modeling results reveal that air-blown gasification scenarios are the most cost-effective ones, while offshore UCG-CCS/CCU scenarios are up to 1.7 times more expensive than the related onshore processes.

This is particularly noteworthy considering the climate change phenomenon, vis a vis sea-level rise, the urgent need for adaptation, efforts aiming for sustainable use of coastal areas, and the recent focus in academic circles on marine spatial planning. Most literature (including grey literature) on artificial islands appears in the engineering and geology disciplines and is focused on energy extraction, i.e., oil and gas. Yet some coastal nations are intent on solving problems of lack of space and other resource shortages through construction of near-shore artificial islands for myriad uses, including commercial, residential and transportation infrastructure. This paper presents a limited review of the policy literature about planning and construction of artificial islands.

To assemble pipe joints by this method, it is expedient to apply the high-speed procedure of resistance butt welding. This welding procedure is certified by APJ-AA Committee, equipment being adapted to marine environment.The main factors contributing to rationality of using the resistance butt welding equipment as a part of j-method complexes are as follows:high speed of welding process;no need in welding consumables;complete automation of operations performed;test of joint qualify by parameters of welding conditions, i.e. without special equipment;minimum personnel;relatively low weight and sizes of the equipment and its moderate price.Open Joint Stock Co, Central Design Bureau Corall has developed particular process equipment for S-method pipelaying complexes that provide the reduction in costs of key equipment in comparison with the ones traditionally applied on board the ships of this purpose.The promotion of works to produce the effective complex for laying pipelines in various sea depths including the ones in deepwater areas and to equip one of out-of-operation vessels with this complex may be reached by uniting efforts of parties interested.",,,,,2nd ISOPE European Offshore Mechanics Symposium (ISOPE-EUROMS-99)2nd ISOPE European Offshore Mechanics Symposium (ISOPE-EUROMS-99),"JUN 07-09, 1999JUN 07-09, 1999",Int Org Comm; Int Soc Offshore & Polar Engineers; All Russia Res Inst Construct Pipelines & Enterprises Fuel & Energy SectorInt Org Comm; Int Soc Offshore & Polar Engineers; All Russia Res Inst Construct Pipelines & Enterprises Fuel & Energy Sector,"MOSCOW, RUSSIAMOSCOW, RUSSIA",0,0,0,,0,0,0,,,,,1-880653-44-3,,,,,,,,,"OJSCo, Cent Design Bur Cornall, Sevastopol, Ukraine",OJSCo,,,1999-01-01,WOS:000085827100008,,

In case of an accident, application of chemical dispersants would be one response option among others. Dispersion breaks oil slicks into small droplets which get then mixed into the water column. Removal of the oil from the water surface may reduce contamination of the coast. However, the window of opportunity for effective dispersant application is short and there are concerns about potential effects to the marine life. We propose a Bayesian network (BN) as an interactive and intuitive tool for responders to justify decisions on using chemical dispersants and possibly the provision of appropriate assets. The BN combines detailed sub-BNs for different criteria that govern the decision process. Expected drift trajectories are estimated based on comprehensive numerical ensemble simulations of hypothetical oil spills. Ecological impacts are represented prototypically, focusing on vulnerability of seabird concentrations to pollution in coastal areas. Dispersant effectiveness is estimated considering oil properties and weather conditions. Decision making is supposed to be based on expected satisfaction. The definition of what is considered satisfactory is of central importance for the whole analysis. (C) 2019 The Authors.

For example, increases in shipping, oil and gas exploration and fishing due to the loss of Arctic sea ice are highly likely to exacerbate acoustic disturbance, ship strikes, bycatch and prey depletion for Arctic cetaceans. In the tropics, climate change may result in increased hunting pressure on near-shore dolphins and whales off Asia, Latin America, Africa, and elsewhere as the availability of other marine resources diminishes. This study explores the range of potential consequences to cetaceans worldwide from predicted climate-driven shifts in human behavior, and evaluates the risks to particular species given their geographic ranges and habitat preferences. While concern about impacts of climate change on cetaceans has largely focused on polar species, the analysis presented here suggests tropical coastal and riverine cetaceans such as the lrawaddy dolphin, Indo-Pacific humpback dolphin, and finless porpoise are particularly vulnerable to those aspects of climate change that are mediated by changes in human behavior. Policy recommendations include the following: (1) information about cetacean populations should be incorporated into national, regional and international climate adaptation decisions wherever possible (for example, via GEF-sponsored adaptation initiatives); and (2) human-mediated impacts of climate change should be included in cetacean conservation and management plans, such as the management procedures of the International Whaling Commission (IWC), where possible. Because human responses to climate change are likely to evolve rapidly over the coming years and decades, it is important that local, regional and international cetacean conservation and management plans include regular reviews to allow them to adapt to new information.

In this paper, a generic model of the overall offshore system is described: its thermodynamic performance is assessed by performing an exergy accounting and rules of thumb for oil and gas platforms are derived. Simulations are built and conducted with the tools Aspen Plus (R), Dynamic Network Analysis and Aspen HYSYS (R). 62-65% of the total exergy destruction of an offshore platform is attributable to the power generation and waste heat recovery system, and 35-38% to the oil and gas processing. The variability of the feed composition has little effect on the split of the thermodynamic irreversibilities between both plants. The rejection of high-temperature gases from the utility and flaring systems is the major contributor to the exergy losses. These findings suggest to focus efforts on a better use of the waste heat contained in the exhaust gases and on the ways in which the gas compression performance can be improved.

Substantial occurrences of natural gas hydrates have been discovered in offshore Indonesia roughly 700miles from Natuna, making the pipeline transport economically feasible. This work aimed to assess the risk of hydrate formation during this transport as evaluated by two different approaches: traditional method based on water dew-point versus evaluation accounting for alternative routes of hydrate formation. The hydrate risk analysis was also conducted for produced natural gas at transport conditions. We have investigated the case study involving using the separated CO2 for simultaneous safe long-term storage of CO2 and release of methane for in situ hydrates located at the North Makassar Basin in offshore Indonesia. Utilization of CO2 will require additive gases to increase gas permeability and reduce the blocking of sediments by new CO2-dominated hydrate. This analysis was conducted for variable content of nitrogen and H2S. We have concluded that the water dew-point-based method appears to severely underestimate the risk of hydrate formation; the maximum water concentration it allows in gas will be larger by a factor of eighteen than the one permitted by approaches that used water adsorption on hematite (rust) as the criterion.",,,,,,,,,11,1,0,0,0,0,12,,,0947-7411,1432-1181,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Bergen, Dept Phys & Technol, Allegaten 55, N-5007 Bergen, Norway",,,,2019-04-12,WOS:000462944400012,,

The bacterial, archaeal and fungal diversities were similar in oil exposed and less exposed sampling sites based on bacterial and archaeal 16S rRNA gene and fungal 5.8S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing from both DNA and RNA fractions. The number of genes participating in alkane degradation (alkB) or PAH-ring hydroxylation (PAH-RHDa) were detected by qPCR in all water and sediment samples. These numbers correlated with the number of bacterial 16S rRNA gene copies in sediment samples but not with the concentration of petroleum hydrocarbons or PAHs. This indicates that both the clean and the more polluted sites at the Baltic Sea coastal areas have a potential for petroleum hydrocarbon degradation. The active community (based on RNA) of the coastal Baltic Sea water differed largely from the total community (based on DNA). The most noticeable difference was seen in the bacterial community in the water samples were the active community was dominated by Cyanobacteria and Proteobacteria whereas in total bacterial community Actinobacteria was the most abundant phylum. The abundance, richness and diversity of Fungi present in water and sediment samples was in general lower than that of Bacteria and Archaea. Furthermore, the sampling location influenced the fungal community composition, whereas the bacterial and archaeal communities were not influenced.

The Triassic Schei Point Group, which is the main source rock interval in Sverdrup Basin, is in the mature stage of hydrocarbon generation (Ro > 0.60%). The type of organic matter is mainly planktonic marine algae and bituminite, deposited in an offshore shelf setting. Rock-Eval T-max values are in the range 428-444 degrees C, in general agreement with reflectance. Organic richness is indicated by the high hydrogen index (HI) values in the shales (in excess of 300 mg HC/gTOC) Less rich source rocks are found in the Jurassic-age Jameson Bay and Ringnes formations, in accordance with previous studies in the nearby Lougheed and Melville islands.Numerous oil and gas fields have been discovered in King Christian Island to dare. Geology shows that the presence or absence of liquid and gaseous hydrocarbons in the reservoirs is related to the development of a system of faults and fractures in the successions stratigraphically above the source rocks. These zones have acted as conduits for oil and gas migration and ultimately, loss. The presence of bitumen staining and numerous populations of solid bitumen, interpreted as allochthonously derived support the theory of hydrocarbon migration in the King Christian Island succession. Migration has taken place over a vertical distance of 800 m to 1500 m.Problems were encountered in measuring vitrinite reflectance, related mainly to the presence of cavings, bitumen staining vitrinite typing oxidation of organic matter, and effect of igneous intrusions. The thermal effect from igneous silts and dykes resulted in thermal cracking of liquid hydrocarbons to gaseous in certain areas. A zone of paleo-overpressure was identified near the contact between a chick sandstone unit and overlying shales exhibiting a kinky vitrinite reflectance profile. Overpressure was attributed to a combination of hydrocarbon generation in the Schei Point or deeper source rocks, high rates of sedimentation in Jurassic to Cretaceous shale units, differential compaction of lithologies, and entrapment of pore wafer.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,0090-8312,,,,,,,,,,,"Natl Ctr Upgrading Technol, Devon, AB T9G 1AB, CanadaGeol Survey Canada, Nat Resources Canada, Calgary, AB T2L 2A7, CanadaGlobal Geoenergy Res Ltd, Halifax, NS, Canada",Natl Ctr Upgrading TechnolGlobal Geoenergy Res Ltd,,,1998-12-01,WOS:000077774900001,,

We are concerned that the tidal flat reclamation may have not only local but also far-field effects on tidal dynamics in the entire BYECS. Numerical study shows different tidal patterns due to tidal energy redistribution when tidal flats around the BYECS are removed, in which the tidal range and phase are changed, and the amphidromic points are displaced. Tidal flats provide storage and dissipation for tidal energy; the former is much more significant than the latter. Loss of these functions caused by tidal flat reclamation will induce a redistribution of the extra tidal energy. Furthermore, we show that far-field effects on tidal dynamics would be observed on the west coast of Korea following significant reclamation on the Chinese Jiangsu coast. In turn, reclamation on the west coast of Korea may generate the far-field effects on the Chinese coast. Reclamation in the BYECS can result in rise of tidal amplitude and onshore sediment transport. The former may enhance the coastal hazards such as storm surge, and the latter may result in severe siltation. Therefore, careful consideration must always be given to any proposed artificial changes to tidal flat, given the effects of these on both the local environment and further afield.

Here, we simultaneously quantify decade-scale isotopic variability at the lowest and highest trophic positions in the offshore California Current System (CCS) by measuring delta N-15 and delta C-13 values of amino acids in a top predator, the sperm whale (Physeter macrocephalus). Using a time series of skin tissue samples as a biological archive, isotopic records from individual amino acids (AAs) can reveal the proximate factors driving a temporal decline we observed in bulk isotope values (a decline of >= 1 %) by decoupling changes in primary producer isotope values from those linked to the trophic position of this toothed whale. A continuous decline in baseline (i. e., primary producer) delta N-15 and delta C-13 values was observed from 1993 to 2005 (a decrease of similar to 4% for delta N-15 source-AAs and 3% for delta C-13 essential-AAs), while the trophic position of whales was variable over time and it did not exhibit directional trends. The baseline delta N-15 and delta C-13 shifts suggest rapid ongoing changes in the carbon and nitrogen biogeochemical cycling in the offshore CCS, potentially occurring at faster rates than long-term shifts observed elsewhere in the Pacific. While the mechanisms forcing these biogeochemical shifts remain to be determined, our data suggest possible links to natural climate variability, and also corresponding shifts in surface nutrient availability.

Prevention of spills and effective response to a major oil spill in the marine waters around Sakhalin Island may be critical to this species' survival. Marine waters around Sakhalin Island are partially or completely covered with sea ice from November until May each year. Ice conditions are highly variable and heavily influenced by seasonal, diurnal, and weather-driven temperature, winds, and sea states. The dynamic ice conditions in the Sea of Okhotsk are dominated by periods of drift ice, at times including areas of contiguous pack ice. Because of the nature of this constantly changing ice regime, oil spilled in this environment would be difficult to contain, track, and recover. This report explores the current state-of-technology for the three primary oil spill response methods: (1) mechanical recovery, (2) dispersants, and (3) in-situ burning and considers their potential use at the Sakhalin II project during broken ice conditions. This report concludes a dynamic ice response gap exists for Sakhalin II operations, due to well-documented limitations on the effectiveness of oil spill response technologies when sea ice is present. Other environmental factors, such as sea state, visibility, current, and temperature, contribute to these limits. Initial planning documents for Sakhalin II propose oil and gas operations to be conducted year round, including periods when significant dynamic drift ice is present in the Sea of Okhotsk. Potential spill sources include the offshore platform tanks, piping and wells, subsea pipelines, marine terminal, and tanker operations. Oil spills from the proposed Sakhalin II Project have the potential to spill oil on ice, under the ice, or interspersed with broken ice. Available oil spill response technologies are limited by the prevailing ice conditions at Sakhalin, which are characterized by constantly shifting ice formations that range in coverage from 20% to 80% and are rarely stable enough to support on-ice spill response. Mechanical recovery is extremely difficult in ice-infested waters, and is not an effective response option for large scale oil spills above 30% ice coverage. Dispersants are an unproven technology in ice-infested waters. There is considerable technical debate among experts about the efficacy of in-situ burning as a primary oil spill response tool in the arctic, particularly under dynamic ice conditions. A review of published literature reveals that in-situ burning has not been demonstrated in actual field tests to be effective in ice coverage above 30% or below 70%. Above 70% coverage, sea ice may provide natural containment, although the sea ice may transport oil great distances so that it is unavailable for response once spring break up occurs. At higher ice concentrations, significant logistical, technical, and safety challenges remain in tracking, accessing, and igniting the oil slicks and recovering burn residues. Similarly, while in-situ burning may be a response option to ignite well blowouts, it has not been demonstrated effective for cleaning up oil from well blowouts in the arctic. Oil well blowouts spray oil long distances away from the source, creating a thin, dispersed oil slick with depleted volatile components, which may be impossible to ignite in open water, broken ice conditions, or due to environmental conditions on-scene. Oil spilled in ice-infested waters, and especially under the ice layer, is not only difficult to contain, it is very difficult to track and model. Marine oil spill tracking and remote sensing technology generally relies on air operations, which can be severely constrained by environmental and logistical factors in winter. Existing mathematical models cannot accurately predict the movement of oil on, under, or among offshore ice, although this is an area where considerable research and development is ongoing. Research and development projects continue to focus on technologies and methods to improve oil spill response in ice-infested waters, and several new technologies for mechanical recovery in ice-infested waters have been introduced. However, the challenge lies in applying these technologies at the scale necessary to clean up a major oil spill. The limits to oil spill response technologies in ice-infested waters create a response gap. This report describes the factors that contribute to the dynamic ice response gap for arctic offshore oil and gas developments such as Sakhalin II. Environmental factors, such as wind speed, sea state, visibility, safety considerations, and logistics contribute to the response gap by further narrowing the window of opportunity to contain, control, and recover oil spilled to marine waters off Sakhalin Island during the ice season. This report does not attempt to quantify the response gap at Sakhalin II; however, additional study of this topic is recommended. Quantification of the specific nature of the Sakhalin II response gap would require detailed analysis of the environmental and ice conditions at the project location and a consideration of the specific spill response technologies that will be used there. Such calculation would provide an extremely useful planning tool, shedding additional light on the number of days a year when ice conditions, wind, sea state, visibility, or cold temperatures may render oil spill response operations unsafe or ineffective. An understanding of the response gap provides additional perspective on the potential oil spill risks and impacts from the project. This report recommends further analysis of the response gap created by environmental conditions in the Sea of Okhotsk, including but not limited to sea ice. Additional research is recommended to better understand the potential environmental and wildlife consequences of an oil spill from Sakhalin II. These include: further study of the impacts of sunken in-situ burn residues to whales that feed on benthic organisms; calculation of worst case oil well blowout volumes based on the open orifice flow rates for the reservoirs; additional analysis of the risks from tanker operations at the oil and LNG export terminal; development of site-specific trajectory models that predicts how oil from various Sakhalin spill scenarios might impact gray whale feeding areas; and additional studies regarding the physical and chemical behaviour of Sakhalin crude oils in ice-infested waters. Further analysis of the Sakhalin II response gap and associated issues will aid in developing oil spill prevention measures and risk mitigation strategies. Spill prevention and risk mitigation policies have been successfully implemented at other oil and gas production operations, including: enhanced leak detection systems, redundant prevention systems, double-hulled and ice breaking vessels, scheduling higher risk operations when effective response is possible, and avoiding higher risk operations during the broken ice period when an oil spill response will not be effective. Oil spilled in broken-ice cannot be cleaned up effectively, and it is expected that whales would not avoid oil-fouled waters. (NRC 2003b) Today there is no proven response method for recovery of large-scale oil spills in ice-infested waters. (Evers et al. 2006) If oil is widely distributed throughout broken ice, no countermeasure methods might be practical. (Owens et al. 1998) Adverse weather conditions sometimes preclude any response at all and require a 'wait until thaw' approach. (Oskins and Bradley 2005) No current cleanup methods remove more than a small fraction of oil spilled in marine waters, especially in the presence of broken ice. (NRC 2003b) In some cases, safety concerns will necessitate the 'monitor and wait' approach rather than attempting a risky marine operation, which might also have a very limited chance of success. (Dickins 2005) Spill response experts agree that existing oil spill response technologies cannot effectively clean up a large scale oil spill to ice-infested waters, and considerable research is ongoing to improve these technologies. However, until more effective clean up methods are realized, the oil spill response gap in ice-infested waters must be considered in developing oil spill contingency plans and spill prevention measures for oil and gas developments where dynamic ice conditions exist. The oil spill response gap in ice-infested waters amplifies the potential impacts of an oil spill from Sakhalin II to the critically endangered gray whale. One study estimates the risk of a major pipeline release at 24% over the lifetime of a project, and a blowout at 3% (ISRP 2005). If a major well blowout, pipeline release, or tanker spill occurred during the six months of the year when broken ice conditions prevail, an effective cleanup is unlikely. Unrecovered oil would persist in the marine environment, with the potential to pollute the water column, shoreline, and sea bottom, and contaminate the Western North Pacific gray whale feeding grounds. Contamination could linger for years, causing irreparable cumulative damage to an extremely vulnerable sub-species.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2006-01-01,ZOOREC:ZOOR14301004867,,

Current energy systems modelling methods do not explore, or are unable to account for, physical (thermodynamic) limits to the rate of change of infrastructure. The power generation sector has a variety of technological options for this low-carbon transition. We compare physically constrained scenarios that accentuate either carbon capture and storage, fastest plausible nuclear new build, or fastest plausible build rate of offshore wind. We set these in the context of the UK's legislated fifth carbon budget, which has a comprehensive range of carbon reduction measures with respect to business-as-usual. The framework for our scenario comparison uses our novel system dynamics model to substantiate the policy's ability to meet 2035 emissions targets while maintaining financial productivity and socially expected employment levels. For an ambitious nuclear new build programme we find that even if it stays on track it is more expensive than offshore wind generation and delays emissions reductions. This affects the cumulative emissions and impacts on the UK's ability to contribute to international climate change targets. If delays or cancellation occur to the deployment programmes of carbon capture and storage technologies or nuclear new build, we suggest the electricity and decarbonisation targets can by met by a fast growth of offshore wind generation with no change to financial and employment levels.",,,,,,,,,10,1,0,0,2,0,11,,,0306-2619,1872-9118,,,,,,,,,,"Arup, 13 Fitzroy St, London W1T 4BQ, EnglandCharles Sturt Univ, Inst Land Water & Soc, POB 789, Albury, NSW 2640, AustraliaBrunel Univ, Inst Energy Futures, London UB8 3PH, EnglandINSEAD Social Innovat Ctr, Residence, Europe Campus,Blvd Constance, F-77305 Fontainebleau, FranceUniv Edinburgh, Sch Informat, 10 Crichton St, Edinburgh EH8 9AB, Midlothian, ScotlandStellenbosch Univ, Fac AgriSci, Private Bag X1, ZA-7602 Matieland, South Africa",Arup,,,2018-12-28,WOS:000447479400033,,

The Wet Tropics Australia, is environmentally and biologically diverse, and supplies numerous ecosystem services. It contributes to the community well-being of this region, Australian national economy and global climate change mitigation efforts. However, the ecosystem services in the region have rarely been assessed undermining strategic landscape planning to sustain their future flow. In this study, we attempted to: (i) assess the quantity of five regulating ecosystem services - global climate regulation, air quality regulation, erosion regulation, nutrient regulation, and cyclone protection, and three provisioning ecosystem services - habitat provision, energy provision and timber provision across rainforests, sclerophyll forests and rehabilitated plantation forests; (ii) evaluate the variation of supply of those regulating and provisioning ecosystem services across environmental gradients, such as rainfall, temperature, and elevation; (iii) show the relationships among those ecosystem services; and (iv) identify the hotspots of single and multiple ecosystem services supply across the landscape. The results showed that rainforests possess a very high capacity to supply single and multiple ecosystem services, and the hotspots for most of the regulating and provisioning ecosystem services are found in upland rainforest followed by lowland rainforest, and upland sclerophyll forest. Elevation, rainfall and temperature gradients along with forest structure are the main determinant factors for the quantity of ecosystem services supplied across the three forest types. The correlation among ecosystem services may be positive or negative depending on the ecosystem service category and vegetation type. The rehabilitated plantation forests may provide some ecosystem services comparable to the rainforest. The results demonstrated disturbance regimes (such as tropical cyclones) may have influenced the usual spatial trend of ecosystem service values. This study will assist decision makers in incorporating ecosystem services into their natural resource management planning, and for practitioners to identify the areas with higher values of specific and multiple ecosystem services.

Over the years the oil and gas industry in Norway has worked hard to find means to prevent hydrocarbon leaks and is today able to report significant progress. In this context, the exploration of accidents in light of human error linked to underlying factors related to the organisation, design and management of work, also called psychosocial risk factors, has been established as a major priority. The objective of this study was to explore to what extent a psychosocial risk indicator obtained from survey data shows a significant relationship with hydrocarbon leaks on Norwegian oil and gas producing platforms and whether it can be used as a proactive indicator for the prevention of such leaks. The context is a major oil and gas company in Norway where the number of hydrocarbon leaks at offshore installations in the period from 2010 to 2011 was considered. This study also explored whether technical factors such as installation age, weight and number of leakage sources have an impact on the number of hydrocarbon leaks at offshore installations. Regression analysis results showed that only the psychosocial risk indicator significantly accounted for variation in hydrocarbon leaks. Only partial support was found for the relationship between technical factors and hydrocarbon leaks on the basis of correlation analysis. The paper offers recommendations for the development of more robust indicator models to prevent hydrocarbon leaks in the oil and gas industry. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Numerical models can be used to project mangrove forest responses to regional and global environmental changes, and the reliability of these models depends on surface energy balance closure. However, for tidal ecosystems, the surface energy balance is complex because the energy transport associated with tidal activity remains poorly understood. This study aimed to quantify impacts of tidal flows on energy dynamics within a mangrove ecosystem. To address the research objective, an intensive 10-day study was conducted in a mangrove forest located along the Shark River in the Everglades National Park, FL, USA. Forest-atmosphere turbulent exchanges of energy were quantified with an eddy covariance system installed on a 30-m-tall flux tower. Energy transport associated with tidal activity was calculated based on a coupled mass and energy balance approach. The mass balance included tidal flows and accumulation of water on the forest floor. The energy balance included temporal changes in enthalpy, resulting from tidal flows and temperature changes in the water column. By serving as a net sink or a source of available energy, flood waters reduced the impact of high radiational loads on the mangrove forest. Also, the regression slope of available energy versus sink terms increased from 0.730 to 0.754 and from 0.798 to 0.857, including total enthalpy change in the water column in the surface energy balance for 30-min periods and daily daytime sums, respectively. Results indicated that tidal inundation provides an important mechanism for heat removal and that tidal exchange should be considered in surface energy budgets of coastal ecosystems. Results also demonstrated the importance of including tidal energy advection in mangrove biophysical models that are used for predicting ecosystem response to changing climate and regional freshwater management practices.",,,,,,,,,24,1,0,0,17,0,27,,,1726-4170,,,,,,,,,,,"S Florida Nat Resource Ctr, Homestead, FL USAPenn State Univ, Dept Meteorol, University Pk, PA 16802 USAUniv Calif Berkeley, Dept Environm Sci Policy & Management, Berkeley, CA 94720 USASweet Briar Coll, Dept Environm Studies, Sweet Briar, VA 24595 USAUniv Virginia, Dept Environm Sci, Charlottesville, VA 22903 USA",S Florida Nat Resource CtrSweet Briar Coll,,,2013-03-05,WOS:000314173700032,,

A series of linear regression relationships linking the units, in which the results of the previous unit represent the predictor for the subsequent unit, was used to obtain information about seagrass biomass (above- and belowground), organic carbon in the living vegetation, and organic carbon in the sediment. All of the modeling units of monospecific patches had higher and more significant correlations between the predictor and response variables compared to those of mixed patches. Following the linked units, the piedicted organic carbon on a landscape scale had a small margin of error for both monospecific and mixed patches. Although the models are applicable only for certain species, they improve the cost effectiveness of the data collection and can be easily applied over a larger spatial scale.

Recently, the area around Pingjum (including this dike) was designated as a potential location for the construction of a new windfarm. In our study, we found that the arts in Pingjum fuelled people's emotional connection to their (coastal) landscape and the Gouden Halsband, enhanced their knowledge of both and triggered them to reflect on the meanings they assign to them. In addition, the arts enhanced people's awareness and stimulated their assessment of the windfarm plans.

This paper presents Hurricane Odile and its impact on the currents in the Gulf of California (GC) as a worst case scenario. A methodology to analyze the impact and its potential effects on tidal energy converters installed within the region are presented. The analysis is based on predictions obtained with a 3D shallow water model forced by tides and the meteorological conditions generated by Odile. A tidal model with no wind forcing was used for validation of the tidal model predictions. After validation, the two models were used to analyze the maximum anomaly in surface currents and sea surface height caused by the passage of Odile, and to analyze at which depth the devices could be deemed safe from any impact of the hurricane. Some anomalies extended throughout the water column, even in the deep regions of the GC.

Umbilical's are typically either exported from the shore directly to the floating platform or deployed to a network of generating devices. Recognised deficiencies in effective submerged interconnection of multiple devices in a single array was a driving force for the launch of this project.Prior to this project Hydro Group had developed the Hydro Group Renewable Connector (HRC), a 3-phase, 24 kV dry mate connector which was an evolution of our existing 11KV dry mate connector, designed to be part of a subsurface wiring system for renewable energy power generation units. The connector allowed wave and tidal energy converters to be deployed and recovered without disturbing the fixed wiring installation connecting them to the shore. At the commencement of this current project, there was a desire in the renewable energy industry to incorporate various connection points into the wiring system, enabling several devices in the field to be deployed from a single cable. However, technology was limited as suitable sealing and electrical isolation systems did not knowingly exist that would be appropriate for subsurface use. Extensive component prototyping would be required to adapt existing onshore surface designs to suit safety requirements and operating conditions offshore.Development of a cost effective yet robust multi-point subsea Power, Distribution Hub (HUB) suitable for the interconnection of heavy armoured seabed and dynamic umbilicals consisting of 3 MV power cores, low voltage cores and fibre optic components, with multiple renewable energy power generation units.

Phytoplankton taxonomy has been used as a classical indicator to assess changes in transitional water communities, however alternative methods based on morphological, behavioral and physiological traits offer the opportunity to compare sites or moments with different taxonomic compositions. Our goal, in this context, is to evaluate phytoplankton community short-term and seasonal variability in a near-pristine estuary, Barra Grande estuary (Ilha Grande, RJ, Brazil), through species functional traits and thus community functional diversity. Samplings were carried out in a mooring in complete tidal cycles, seasonally during 2012. Our results showed a diverse phytoplankton community with 38 frequent and abundant taxa, marked by density variation (1.2x10.4-2x10.7cellL(-1)) in depth, with abundance inversely related to tidal currents. The functional structure of the phytoplankton community measured by functional diversity (FD), varied seasonally in and across a gradient of tidal energy. A core community, mainly represented by flagellates and dinoflagellates, occurred in all observations and was highly functional (high FD), exploiting a variety of habitats. The chain-forming diatoms were associated with high tidal energy, and occurred in higher densities during summer. Phytoplankton cell size, cell shape, and the ability to form colonies are extremely plastic traits that can be regulated by the environment, however, isolated tychopelagic diatoms were present in the study area across all seasons, with higher contributions in autumn and winter, reflecting the shallow characteristic of this system. During the winter, an exposed sandbar was formed, and the lack of connection with the ocean resulted in an abundance of riverine and brackish water taxa. In this near-pristine estuary the densities and occurrences of HAB phytoplankton are low. Trait-based analyses add information about community structure, which can be impacted by anthropogenic actions in urbanized coastal systems. Thus the information provided by this study regarding phytoplankton functional diversity and its relation to nutrients and hydrography in Barra Grande Estuary can be applied as a baseline model for the development of public policies.",,,,,,,,,11,0,0,0,11,2,11,,,0173-9565,1439-0485,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Estado Rio de Janeiro, Fac Oceanog, Rio De Janeiro, Brazil",,,,2017-08-31,WOS:000408030500006,,

These potential sites of large scale for tidal power plant have developed in seventeen places in coastal areas in Zhejiang and Fujian provinces, each of which has the installed capacity of over ten thousand kW and enjoys fantastic natural conditions. With the support from special funds for Marine Renewable Energy, and local government and enterprises, Rushankou, Jiantiao, Bachimen, Maluanwan, and Oufei, five tidal power plants with installed capacity of over ten thousand kW, have already got complete pre-scientific research design, making it possible for further development and exploitation. While special funds also aided standardized work for development and exploitation of tidal power, it lays sound foundation for the development of the industry. Since 1950s, China has established numerous small-sized tidal power stations and built Jiangxia tidal power station, the third largest one in the world in 1986.

Various marine species including whales may be tracked by triangulating their vocalisations. Active faulting and magma intrusion beneath the seabed may be located by tracking the associated seismicity. Similar approaches may be used to track gas escaping through the seabed, which is now important in the context of sub-seabed carbon capture and storage (CCS), where it is important to verify that stored gas is not escaping back to the seabed. Currently in all of these applications, sound is detected by an array comprising a relatively small number (typically a few to a few tens) of point detectors, that may be towed or (more commonly) deployed on or near the seabed. Optical-fibre Distributed Acoustic Sensing (DAS) is a new technology that allows acoustic measurements to be made at an unlimited number of locations along a fibre, with a trade-off between measurement density and sensitivity. The fibre can also be manufactured relatively cheaply and at today's market prices telecom fibres coated with a polymer layer costs less than 1p per metre. Even with fibres are engineered with additional armouring to resist the weight of vehicles passing on them, their cost only increases to a few pounds per metre. Thus, this technology has the potential to locate and quantify sound sources in and beneath the ocean with much greater accuracy, and potentially much lower cost, than hitherto possible. Deployment of this technology in the ocean is limited by poor understanding of the coupling between acoustic waves and a DAS fibre within the water column or resting on the ocean floor. In this feasibility study, we propose to use a DAS system manufactured in Southampton, which can be specifically tailored for the monitoring of underwater acoustic signals and operate at frequencies commonly not used in commercial systems, to reconstruct a 3D map of acoustic fields in the ocean. Our approach will be to firstly determine the relationship between an acoustic signal in the ocean and the signal generated in the DAS fibre laid on the seabed. We will then determine a 3D model of the acoustic sources from the sensing enabled by the seabed fibre. Our next step is to then determine how to adapt and apply DAS technology so that it is suitable for detecting, locating and quantifying acoustic noise sources in the ocean. We will do some simple tests of the new technology in test tanks and in the marine environment (a dock within the port of Southampton). This project will build on research currently funded by NERC, EPSRC, Carbon Trust, the Royal Academy of Engineering and the Royal Society to provide a novel distributed acoustic sensor network capable of high-resolution 3D detection and analysis of underwater acoustic sources",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,NE/T005890/1,,,,,,,,University of Southampton,,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:15327637,,

Developments are subject to intense scrutiny, and potential environmental impacts must be assessed. Unfortunately many of these impacts are still poorly understood, including the implications that come with altering the hydrodynamics. Here, methods are proposed to quantify ecological impact and to incorporate its minimisation into the array design process. Four tidal developments in the Pentland Firth are modelled with the array optimisation tool OpenTidalFarm, that designs arrays to generate the maximum possible profit. Maximum entropy modelling is used to create habitat suitability maps for species that respond to changes in bed-shear stress. Changes in habitat suitability caused by an altered tidal regime are assessed. OpenTidalFarm is adapted to simultaneously optimise array design to maximise both this habitat suitability and to maximise the profit of the array. The problem is thus posed as a multi-objective optimisation problem, and a set of Pareto solutions found, allowing trade-offs between these two objectives to be identified. The methods proposed generate array designs that have reduced negative impact, or even positive impact, on the habitat suitability of specific species or habitats of interest. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

The organic composition of resins, already complicated, is not always preserved over time and can be considerably affected by ageing. Hence, their occurrence in archaeological items leads to the necessity to identify them taxonomically with precision. Resinous organic materials collected near and/or on wrecks discovered in South China Sea, supposed to contain dammar resins because of their geographical excavation context, were investigated by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS), together with freshly collected dammars, to establish taxonomic and alteration parameters allowing to identify dammar even in very altered samples or in mixtures together with other organic materials. This study specially focuses on three samples collected within or close to the M1J wreck, a Portuguese wreck lost in the Straight of Malacca during the 16th century. Our analyses establish that all three are made of dammar, two of them in association with pitch and bitumen. In addition, biodegradation biomarkers were detected in all these three samples, indicating that they were submitted to microbial degradation processes during their ageing. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Compared to rotary boring systems, seabed based systems are relatively cost effective and minimize the disturbance from typical drilling processes. Piston corer is the most widely used type of equipment to retrieve soil samples in seabed based systems. In this paper, a conceptual design of a low-cost piston corer system named QuickCore is proposed. This system can be efficiently deployed and recovered by standard Anchor Handling Vessels (AHV). A key feature of this proposed piston corer system is a steel frame to cover the piston corer equipment and enable the piston corer to be brought over the stern roller of AHV. In contrast to a typical piston corer system used in offshore geotechnical investigation, the new design will significantly reduce the operational cost by avoiding the use of specialized vessels.

In RM regression designs, the same n replicates (usually stations in monitoring programs) are re-sampled (i.e., repeatedly measured) at t > 1 Times (usually years). The stations provide variation in the predictor, or X variables. In the Terra Nova environmental effects monitoring (EEM) program, n = 48 stations were sampled in each of t = 7 years from 2000 to 2010. Two distance measures from five drill centres (sources of drilling wastes) were fixed predictor variables. RM regression designs are rarely used in environmental monitoring programs, but are often suitable and would be appropriate if applied to data from many monitoring programs. For the Terra Nova EEM program, carry-over effects, or persistent and usually small-scale variations among stations unrelated to distance, were strong for most sediment quality variables. Whenever natural carry-over effects are strong, RM designs and analysis will usually be more powerful and suitable than alternative approaches to the analysis. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

However, the extent, age, lithology, sequence and thickness of these vanished rocks have proved to be a controversial subject. The principal methods employed to determine the burial and thermal history of the region, and to estimate the thickness and nature of the eroded rocks, are (1) extrapolation of stratigraphical information from the preserved strata, (2) variations in rock physical properties with depth in boreholes and (3) depth conversion of palaeotemperature measurements and estimates from apatite fission track analysis, diagenetic mineral assemblages and alteration of organic matter. The exploration for oil and gas in the region and adjacent offshore areas provided a spur to such investigations. All the methods used are, to a greater or lesser extent, dependent on unverifiable assumptions. The results obtained have been somewhat contradictory, with estimates of the thickness of eroded Mesozoic overburden in the Northern Pennines, the Lake District and the Cleveland Hills ranging from a few hundred metres to more than 3000 m.Early modelling studies of the palaeotemperature data, derived from apatite fission track analysis on samples from the Lake District and some adjacent parts of the Northern Pennines, have suggested that the minimum thickness of Mesozoic rocks over much of this area was in excess of 3000 m. However, a more recent investigation which took into account the locally high heat flows in this area. and made use of more refined methods of converting palaeotemperatures to palaeodepths, indicates an eroded overburden thickness of only c. 1500 m, a value consistent with regional stratigraphical information and some sonic log studies.The depth conversion of some palaeotemperature data from the East Midlands Shelf and the Cleveland Basin, where heat flow is somewhat lower than in the Lake District, is reassessed. Several modelling options have been considered. The palaeotemperature data are consistent with the removal of c. 2500 m of post-Middle Jurassic overburden from the central parts of the inverted Cleveland Basin. Similar conclusions have been reached from several sonic log studies. Regional stratigraphical trends suggest that it is unlikely that all of these eroded rocks were of Mesozoic (Upper Jurassic and Cretaceous) age, and it seems more probable that up to c. 1000 m were of Early Cenozoic age. Modelling of palaeotemperature data, combined with regional stratigraphical information and sonic log compaction studies, suggest that the maximum thickness of Chalk on the East Midlands Shelf, before erosion, was c. 700 m. The modelling is unable to discriminate between alternative explanations for the inferred thicknesses of missing strata from the East Midlands Shelf (Cleethorpes and Biscathorpe boreholes): either (1) the missing rocks were all Late Cretaceous Chalk, or (2! the missing rocks were mainly Chalk, partially eroded in end-Cretaceous/Early Cenozoic times, and overlain by a few tens of metres of Early Cenozoic strata.",,,,,,,,,13,0,0,0,1,0,13,,,0044-0604,,,,,,,,,,,"British Geol Survey, Kingsley Durham Ctr, Keyworth NG12 5GG, Notts, England",,,,1999-11-01,WOS:000083591300001,,

The information system includes environmental and economic data, linkages between land use activities, their co-benefits, inputs to the economy and benefits for human well-being. Forest management was used as an example of application of the accounting framework because it has the greatest climate change mitigation potential of all land use activities. A case study developing carbon accounts for a forest region in south-eastern Australia demonstrated the mitigation benefits of long-term carbon storage and sequestration in native forests. Using environmental-economic accounts helped identify policy and market instruments required to value ecosystem services of carbon storage and sequestration by applying a potential market price for carbon. We identified benefits of native forest protection as a carbon abatement activity, and compared this value to that of current forest management for timber harvesting that reduces carbon stocks. Both land uses provided similar economic contributions (approximately $12 million yr(-1), using a minimal carbon price), but native forest protection has additional co-benefits of improving water yield, tourism, recreation and biodiversity conservation. The accounts determine values of land use activities in physical and monetary metrics, and link these to beneficiaries of ecosystem services, so that maximum benefits for public good are identified. Quantifying ecosystem services of carbon storage (protecting stocks) and sequestration (increasing flows) in a native forest region, by applying a potential market price, broadens the policy options for mitigation activities. Adopting a comprehensive accounting system, and changing some of the definitions and rules under the Paris Agreement and national emissions reduction policies and markets, would allow the mitigation benefit of protecting native forests to be realised.",,,,,,,,,20,0,0,0,12,0,22,,,1462-9011,1873-6416,,,,,,,,,,"Australian Natl Univ, Fenner Sch Environm & Soc, Bldg 141 Linnaeus Way, Canberra, ACT 2601, AustraliaGriffith Univ, Griffith Climate Change Response Program, Southport, Qld 4222, Australia",,,,2019-02-19,WOS:000457508000020,,

Colonization brought significant changes to the native and endemic flora of Bermuda. Original floral diversity was low, due to the effects of isolation and lack of previous anthropogenic influences. Two dominant endemic components of the flora, Bermuda cedar (Juniperus bermudiana) and Bermuda palmetto (Sabal bermudana), were extensively utilized by the colonists. Cedar was used for housing, furniture, shipbuilding and export, while the palmetto was used for roof thatch, basketry, food and drink. Exploitation of these species occurred to such extent that the General Laws of Bermuda included resolutions protecting them as early as 1622. Later, in the period between 1946 and 1951, two accidentally introduced scale insects eliminated 95% of the existing cedar population. While the flora and geography of upland habitats on Bermuda have been drastically modified by humans, the peat marsh basins have remained relatively unaffected. From the peats of one of these, Devonshire Marsh, a 9-m core was extracted for pollen analysis and to evaluate the potential for further study. The pollen record below 1.6 m indicated very little change in the native and endemic flora of Bermuda, but above that depth statistically significant changes in the relative abundances of pollen of Bermuda cedar and Bermuda palmetto are noted. Relative abundances of both species decreases significantly above this depth. This decrease is interpreted to represent the arrival of colonists and their impact on the cedar and palmetto populations. A second decrease in relative abundance of Bermuda cedar is recorded above 0.7 m. This reflects the scale infestation and decimation of the remaining cedar population. Coincident with decreases in cedar and palmetto are increases in relative abundance of Poaceae and Asteraceae, indicative of cleared land and the spread of weedy taxa. A radiocarbon date of 520 +/- 70 yr BP at a depth of 1.7 m and major changes in relative abundance of palynomorphs in proximity to the marsh surface allows their interpretation as a record of human impact on the endemic flora of Bermuda.",,,,,1994 Meeting of the American-Quaternary-Association1994 Meeting of the American-Quaternary-Association,"JUN 19-22, 1994JUN 19-22, 1994",Amer Quaternary AssocAmer Quaternary Assoc,"UNIV MINNESOTA, MINNEAPOLIS, MNUNIV MINNESOTA, MINNEAPOLIS, MN",9,0,0,0,6,0,10,,,0921-2728,,,,,,,,,,,"UNIV COLORADO,INST ARCTIC & ALPINE RES,BOULDER,CO 80309GEOENGINEERS INC,REDMOND,WA 98052",GEOENGINEERS INC,,,1996-07-01,WOS:A1996UX31400004,,

With the passage of time, there is an increase in the water fraction in reservoirs that adds to the strain put on these facilities, and thus larger quantities of oil are being discharged into the oceans, which has in many studies been linked to negative effects on marine life. In many cases, such installations are controlled using non-cooperative single objective controllers which are inefficient in handling fluctuating inflows or complicated operating conditions. This work introduces a model-based robust H-infinity control solution that handles the entire de-oiling system and improves the system's robustness towards fluctuating flow thereby improving the oil recovery and reducing the environmental impacts of the discharge.

In the offshore oil and gas industry, the use of potentially hazardous materials and operation under progressively hostile environments increases the risk of major accidents. Regulators have been trying to catch up on the design of regulatory frameworks that prevent these types of events, aiming to protect people, assets, and the environment. Although there are some recommended practices that companies have been using as the basis for their process safety management systems (PSMS), lack of uniformity and inefficient enforcement remain as two fundamental problems. This paper explores these two problems and takes some first steps toward a broader discussion about these important issues. We draw from the literature on sustainable operations to develop a descriptive case study of the offshore oil and gas industry by employing document analysis and an analysis of the Health, Safety and Environment Management System (HSEMS) of Petrobras, a world leader energy company. By employing multiple primary and secondary data collection strategies, including a number of formal expert interviews, we map, explore and compare major recommended practices for PSMS, identify a series of gaps in policy and practice, and offer a number of recommendations and implications for practice, policy, and research.

Some of this oil was mechanically or chemically dispersed before reaching the shore. With a set of laboratory-column experiments we show that the addition of chemical dispersants (Corexit 9500A) increases the mobility of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in saturated permeable sediments by up to two orders of magnitude. Distribution and concentrations of PAHs, measured in the solid phase and effluent water of the columns using GC/MS, revealed that the mobility of the PAHs depended on their hydrophobicity and was species specific also in the presence of dispersant. Deepest penetration was observed for acenaphthylene and phenanthrene. Flushing of the columns with seawater after percolation of the oiled water resulted in enhanced movement by remobilization of retained PAHs. An in-situ benthic chamber experiment demonstrated that aromatic hydrocarbons are transported into permeable sublittoral sediment, emphasizing the relevance of our laboratory column experiments in natural settings. We conclude that the addition of dispersants permits crude oil components to penetrate faster and deeper into permeable saturated sands, where anaerobic conditions may slow degradation of these compounds, thus extending the persistence of potentially harmful PAHs in the marine environment. Application of dispersants in nearshore oil spills should take into account enhanced penetration depths into saturated sands as this may entail potential threats to the groundwater.",,,,,,,,,33,0,0,0,24,0,48,,,1932-6203,,,,,,,,,,,"Florida State Univ, Dept Earth Ocean & Atmospher Sci, Tallahassee, FL 32306 USAUniv Utrecht, Dept Earth Sci, Utrecht, Netherlands",,,,2013-01-16,WOS:000311885800083,23209777,

The stands are adjacent to one another and serve as references against which silvicultural treatments can be compared. The soil parent material of the stands was different (marine sediments versus glacial till), which provided an ideal opportunity to compare C stocks between these stands. We used tree ring analysis and repeated forest inventories to estimate tree and dead wood recruitment patterns and past disturbance severity. Site quality influenced C trajectories through its influence on tree species composition, which in turn strongly determined stand susceptibility to insect outbreaks. In 2012, total ecosystem C stocks were 196.3 +/- 9.6 Mg ha(-1) (mean +/- SD) in the stand on soils derived from marine sediments and 247.0 +/- 17.7 Mg ha(-1) in the stand on soils derived from glacial till. Differences in average total ecosystem C stocks were primarily driven by the live tree C pool. Despite the occurrence of several partial disturbance events from 1954 to 2012, live tree C stocks increased over time in both stands. Average C accumulation in recruited dead wood was also positive, indicating that aboveground biomass served as a C sink.

This study investigates the export of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM) from New England salt marsh sediment seasonally and under possible expected drought conditions. Surface sediment total organic carbon (TOC) values shifted seasonally depending on the overlying dominant plant species suggesting that vegetation and inundation frequency and duration are key factors in sediment TOC fluctuations. Fall sediment samples leached more DOC than summer samples, were compositionally similar to the estuarine water column, and compositionally different from fresh plant matter. Thus, the seasonal TOC pulse incorporated into surface sediments could be a dominant source of DOC to the estuary in the fall and that summer contributions are presumed to be from upstream DOM sources based on optical properties. Sediments leached more DOC under drought than non-drought conditions due to induced cracking in the sediment enhancing organic matter degradation. This study suggests the majority of DOM exported laterally from salt marshes comes from surface sediments (versus plant matter) and that temperature and sea-level rise could affect seasonal and drought pulses of DOC from the marsh.",,,,,,,,,9,0,0,0,8,0,9,,,0277-5212,1943-6246,,,,,,,,,,"Suffolk Univ, Ctr Urban Ecol & Sustainabil, 20 Somerset St, Boston, MA 02108 USAUniv Massachusetts, Sch Environm, 100 Morrissey Blvd, Boston, MA 02125 USA",,,,2019-10-25,WOS:000490828200001,,

Here we present calculations of vertical differences in oxygen and carbon isotopes (Delta delta O-18 and Delta delta C-13, respectively) from a depth transect of southwest Pacific Ocean sediment cores to reconstruct changes in water mass structure and CO2 storage. During the Last Glacial Maximum, Delta delta O-18 indicates a more homogenous deep Pacific below 1,100 m, whereas regional Delta delta C-13 elucidates greater sequestration of CO2 in two distinct layers: enhanced CO2 storage at intermediate depths between similar to 940 and 1,400 m, and significantly more CO2 at 1,600 m and below. This highlights an isolated glacial intermediate water mass and places the main geochemical divide at least 500 m shallower than the Holocene. During the initial stages of the deglaciation in Heinrich Stadial 1 (17.5-14.5 ka), restructuring of the upper similar to 2,000 m of the southwest Pacific water column coincided with sea-ice retreat and rapid CO2 release from intermediate depths, while CO2 release from the deep ocean was earlier and more gradual than waters above it. These changes suggest that sea-ice retreat and shifts in Southern Ocean frontal locations contributed to rapid CO2 ventilation from the Southern Ocean's intermediate depths and gradual ventilation from the deep ocean during the early deglaciation.",,,,,,,,,9,0,0,0,5,0,9,,,2572-4517,2572-4525,,,,,,,,,,"Rutgers State Univ, Dept Marine & Coastal Sci, New Brunswick, NJ 08854 USA",,,,2019-06-25,WOS:000471238100001,,

In north Norfolk, highly unsteady creek flows exhibit well-developed velocity and stress transients which result from the discontinuous nature of the tidal prism and the interaction of shallow water tidal inputs with hydraulically rough vegetated surfaces. Marsh morphological development is governed by a form-process feedback, in the sense that the marsh surface acts as a topographic threshold separating the depositional regime of below-marsh tides from the erosional (ebb-dominated) regime of over-marsh tides. Vertical marsh growth results in increasing intermittency of creek sediment transport. Furthermore, velocity transients are associated with large discharges which must be allowed for in material flux computations. Creek flux measurements are not in themselves sufficient to estimate total material budgets, since a large proportion of tidal exchange may take place via the marsh edge. Such studies should focus instead on direct measurement of marsh surface processes.

As woody mangroves continue to encroach into herbaceous salt marshes, it is important to understand how these wetland biomes differ in soil microbial communities. Mangroves and marsh plants have different rooting structures and chemical qualities and could generate different environments for soil microbes, thus leading to changes in soil carbon processing. In an ecotonal ecosystem in Florida, where mangroves are rapidly encroaching into salt marshes, we compared wetland soil microbial community composition and function in mangrove-dominated vs. salt marsh-dominated plots. Microbial community structure differed between mangrove-dominant and marsh-dominant plots. The top indicator genera in the marsh-dominated plots belonged to putatively anaerobic groups (Tepidibacter, Caldithrix, Desulfovibro, Fibrobacteres, Thiotrichaceae) while top indicator genera in mangrove-dominated plots had representatives within Acidobacteria, Nitrospirae, and Proteobacteria. In a substrate-induced respiration assay, samples from mangrove plots with the greatest root mass also had the highest rate of labile C substrate consumption.

The major environmental concern with these discharges is the potential for nutrients in the wastewater to stimulate excess primary production in the sea: PLOOM, and its predecessor, the Perth Coastal Waters Study, have been instrumental in developing parameters for the measurement of the performance of Perth's ocean outlets. These parameters are currently being integrated in the development of Environmental duality Criteria (EQC) for the Perth region. EQC play an important role in the management framework by-providing the quantitative benchmarks for measuring success in achieving the environmental quality objectives. PLOOM has monitored a range of environmental parameters in the Perth Metropolitan area, including water quality, nutrient levels, water circulation and plume dilution, levels of metals and pesticides present in the marine environment, and the environmental health of benthic communities, in particular of temperate reef systems. During the PLOOM studies, a valuable tool was being developed to monitor outlet performance. Artificial reef structures (periphyton collectors) were placed in the plume trajectory. Here, periphyton is defined as: the microalgae (diatoms and microscopic filamentous forms), algal propagules, bacteria, microfauna and particulate material that are found in a mucous-like layer commonly coating seagrass leaves, and that initially colonise artificial surfaces. The advantage of periphyton collectors is that these largely remove the effects of natural variability, can be placed at any depth and distance from a potential nutrient source, provide an easy, cost effective measure of environmental impact, integrated over an extended period (one month), and produce tangible results which can be interpreted by the wider community, as well as legislative authorities and by outlet managers. In addition, outlet performance can be measured by means of these tools, and tested against accepted environmental criteria. Between 1995-2001,,periphyton collectors, consisting of 15 x 16 cm PVC,plates attached to moorings at fixed depths (2, 4 and 8 m), were deployed for one month during spring, summer and autumn, at increasing distance from the source (250 and 500 m distance to the north, east, west, and south, and at 1,000, 2,000, 4,000 m to the north and south only). After retrieval, the collectors were,analysed for total biomass (g AFDW m(-2)), calcium carbonate content (% AFOW) and chlorophyll levels (chlorophyll a m(-2)).The results confirmed the predictions made by hydrodynamic modelling (e.g. Zic and Gondinoudis, 2002) and are in accordance with measured nutrient and chlorophyll a levels around the outlets, and demonstrated that the zone of influence was strongly determined by the prevailing currents (to the north), and,largely restricted to surface layers (2-4 m depth). Both biomass and a chlorophyll content proved reliable parameters, which have the potential to be used as Environmental Quality Criteria (ECQ's) for the management of Perth's coastal waters. These EQC's were developed in collaboration with legislative authorities, as part of draft criteria, in accordance with national guidelines: AKZECC/ARMCANZ (2000) Australian and New Zealand Guidelines for Fresh and Marino Water Quality.",,,,,3rd World Water Congress of the International-Water-Association3rd World Water Congress of the International-Water-Association,"APR 07-12, 2002APR 07-12, 2002",Int Water AssocInt Water Assoc,"MELBOURNE, AUSTRALIAMELBOURNE, AUSTRALIA",5,0,0,0,3,0,5,,,0273-1223,,,,,,,,,,,"Halliburton KBR Pty Ltd, Perth, WA 6000, Australia",,,,2003-01-01,WOS:000183453700017,12793671,

A key aspect of the Fellowship will be to chart the possibilities, scope and limitations of a wide portfolio of environmental data resources from industry, academic research and the wider environmental community. For the last three decades, EU environmental policies have focused on determining adverse and undesirable changes to the natural system as the result of human activities and on initiating management responses to alleviate impacts (Borja et al. 2009). In addition, resource management, environmental assessment and monitoring primarily focus on single industry sectors in many regions (Queffelec et al. 2009; Kenny et al. 2009). However, there has been a shift in the perception of environmental management in the political agenda, with a move towards an integrative and ecosystem-based management system (EBM), a requirement for quantitative cumulative impact assessment and mapping; and integrated monitoring measures. The environmental research undertaken during the Fellowship will focus on pertinent policy, industry and research questions that may include: (a) what monitoring requirements need to be met for decommissioning; (b) how can recovery be assessed; and (c) will ongoing monitoring be required? A strict legal framework of national, regional and international regulations governs how disused offshore facilities are decommissioned. Presently, and in the coming years and decades, a number of offshore O&G installations will be decommissioned, not only presenting a number of economic issues (Oil & Gas UK forecasts the total cost of decommissioning for existing and sanctioned infrastructure to be £28.7 billion from 2012 onwards); but also a number of significant environmental challenges. The combination of decommissioning issues, new deep-water exploration territories (platforms in deeper water may have probability higher risk of an incident, such as a spill); and the new production techniques, all highlight areas of uncertainty in environmental data management and assessment. Only a coherent environmental data platform will enable assessment and analysis to be conducted efficiently and in the most scientifically rigorous manner. Thus, one of the key activities of this Fellowship includes the development of a web-based mapping portal that incorporates current NERC, industry and other sources of environmental data. This portal will make a transformative difference in data accessibility. The Fellowship will also contribute towards a culture of change with regard to data collation and management. Through close industry liaison and KE, the Fellow will work towards securing industry buy-in to this concept of contributing data directly into the portal at source (e.g. uploaded directly as part of the reporting process). Therefore we anticipate that this KE project will also influence future environmental policy and legislation and facilitate addressing uncertainties surrounding the assessment of licensed activity impacts from exploration through to decommissioning on the environment.Traditionally, marine monitoring around the UK has been limited in scope, in part due to lack of guidance on what, when and how things should be monitored. This is in contrast to, for example, the Norwegian O&G industry which has carried out systematic monitoring of the offshore environment since the ninties (CPA, 2011; OSPAR, 2007) Understanding how Norwegian authorities use their environmental data and lessons learned from the process will be important in determining how best to create the KE platform. Discussions are currently underway to establish Norwegian partnerships, building upon the HWU research team's existing collaborations with the Institute for Marine Research who lead the Norwegian shelf habitat mapping MAREANO programme.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,NE/M006859/2,,,,,,,,University of Aberdeen,,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:15339999,,

The present paper has reviewed over 60 studies that have reported the levels of contaminants, including PAHs, metals and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) present in seawater, sediment and representative marine organisms. Most of the reviewed literature confirmed that while Kuwait's marine environment has been subjected to a wide array of pollution events, the actual levels of contamination remains relatively low.

Consequently, it is not easy to select the most appropriate technical standards that increase the overall level of safety and environmental protection whilst avoiding the costs of additional certifications. We will show how some technical standards and procedures, which are recognized worldwide by the petroleum industry, can be accepted by various standardization bodies, and how they can fulfil the essential health and safety requirements of certain directives.

Plant species richness was equivalent among low, medium and high Phragmites density plots, and overall plant community composition did not vary significantly by Phragmites density. Shoreline change was most negative (landward retreat) where Phragmites density was highest (-0.40 +/- 0.19m yr(-1) vs. -0.31 +/- 0.10 for low density Phragmites) in the high energy marsh of Kitty Hawk Woods Reserve and most positive (soundward advance) where Phragmites density was highest (0.19 +/- 0.05 m yr(-1) vs. 0.12 +/- 0.07 for low density Phragmites) in the lower energy marsh of Currituck Banks Reserve, although there was no significant effect of Phragmites density on shoreline change. In Currituck Banks, mean soil carbon content was approximately equivalent in cores extracted from low and high Phragmites density plots (23.23 +/- 2.0 kg C m(-3) vs. 22.81 +/- 3.8). In Kitty Hawk Woods, mean soil carbon content was greater in low Phragmites density plots (36.63 +/- 10.22 kg C m(-3)) than those with medium (13.99 +/- 1.23 kg C m(-3)) or high density (21.61 +/- 4.53 kg C m(-3)), but differences were not significant.

However, it is possible that CO2 leakages could occur during the injection and sequestration procedure, with significant repercussions for the marine environment. We investigate the effects of acidification derived from possible CO2 leakage events on the European green crab, Carcinus maenas. To this end, a lab-scale experiment involving direct release of CO2 was conducted at pH values between 7.7 and 6.15. Female crabs were exposed for 10 days to sediment collected from two different coastal areas, one with relatively uncontaminated sediment (RSP) and the other with known contaminated sediment (MZ and ML), under the pre-established seawater pH conditions. Survival rate, histopathological damage and metal (Fe, Mn, Cu, Zn, Cr, Cd and Pb) and As accumulation in gills and hepatopancreas tissue were employed as endpoints. In addition, the obtained results were compared with the results of the physico-chemical characterization of the sediments, which included the determination of the metals Fe, Mn, Cu, Zn, Cr, Pb and Cd, the metalloid As, certain polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), as well as nonchemical sediment properties (grain size, organic carbon and total organic matter). Significant associations were observed between pH and the histological damage. Concentrations of Fe, Mn, Cr, Pb, Cd and PAHs in sediment, presented significant negative correlations with the damage to gills and hepatopancreas, and positive correlations with metal accumulation in both tissues. The results obtained in this study reveal the importance of sediment properties in the biological effects caused by possible CO2 leakage. However, a clear pattern was not observed between metal accumulation in tissues and pH reduction. Animals' avoidance behavior and degree of tolerance to acidification are confounding factors for assessing metal bioaccumulation. Further research is required to find a suitable assay that would allow us to predict the risk to environmental health of possible negative side effects of metal mobility derived from CO2 leakage during its injection and storage in sub-seabed formations.

The phenomenon of pipeline walking is a topic that has drawn a great deal of attention, and is related to the on-bottom stability of the pipeline, such as directional accumulation with respect to axial movement, which can threaten the security of the entire pipeline system. An accurate assessment of pipeline walking is therefore necessary for offshore pipeline design. This paper reports a comprehensive suite of numerical analyses investigating the performance of pipeline walking, with a focus on the effect of increasing axial soil resistance on walking rates. Three walking-driven modes (steel catenary riser (SCR) tension, downslope, and thermal transient) are considered, covering a wide range of influential parameters. The variation in walking rate with respect to the effect of increased soil friction is well reflected in the development of the effective axial force (EAF) profile. A method based on the previous analytical solution is proposed for predicting the accumulated walking rates throughout the entire service life, where the concept of equivalent soil friction is adopted.",,,,,,,,,4,0,0,0,0,0,4,,,,2077-1312,,,,,,,,,,"Tianjin Univ, State Key Lab Hydraul Engn Simulat & Safety, Tianjin 300072, Peoples R ChinaTianjin Port Engn Inst Co Ltd, Tianjin 300222, Peoples R ChinaFirst Harbor Engn Co Ltd, Tianjin 300461, Peoples R ChinaDNV GL, Z1,Veritasveien 1, N-1363 Hovik, Norway",Tianjin Port Engn Inst Co LtdFirst Harbor Engn Co Ltd,,,2019-12-24,WOS:000502261500024,,

Marine vegetation (e.g. mangrove and seagrass meadows) is less than 0.5% of the total marine area and narrower compared to terrestrial vegetation. However, marine vegetation has high net primary production (NPP) and contributes more than 50% of the global carbon burial in its substrate and biomass. Indonesia has 3,301,848 ha of mangrove area, the widest in South-East Asia. The seagrass meadows of Indonesia are 150,693 ha, the second widest seagrass area in the world. These two ecosystems are important for the global carbon cycle due to their high capacity for carbon sequestration. Considering this potential, it is necessary to promote a strategic scientific-based policy of conservation of marine vegetation areas for both local and national stakeholders. The policies consist of: 1) to implement the National/Local Action Plan for Reducing Greenhouse Gas Emissions (RAN/D GRK); 2) to manage the land use changes that contribute 67% of total national emissions; 3) to determine coastal ecosystem protection areas that are considering the province policy in the Plan for Zoning of Coastal Areas and Small Islands (RZWP3K); 4) to rehabilitate terrestrial vegetation, coastal ecosystems, and aquatic conservation areas (President Regulation no 61/2011); and 5) to strictly carry out the national policy for green open space (Government Regulation no 26/2008).",,,,,9th International Conference on Global Resource Conservation (ICGRC) and AJI from Ritsumeikan University9th International Conference on Global Resource Conservation (ICGRC) and AJI from Ritsumeikan University,"MAR 07-08, 2018MAR 07-08, 2018","Peningkatan Publikasi Karya Ilmiah Dosen; Brawijaya Univ, Green Campus ProgramPeningkatan Publikasi Karya Ilmiah Dosen; Brawijaya Univ, Green Campus Program","Malang City, INDONESIAMalang City, INDONESIA",1,0,0,0,0,0,1,,,0094-243X,,978-0-7354-1737-3,,,,,,,,,"Indonesian Inst Sci LIPI, Res Ctr Oceanog, Jalan Pasir Putih 1, Jakarta 14430, Indonesia",,,,2019-09-04,WOS:000481577800053,,

The present review sought to summarize and discuss findings from the 50+ peer-reviewed publications reporting effects of DWH oil exposure on teleost fish, and concludes that oil toxicity is a multi-target, multi-organ syndrome with substantial species- specific sensitivity differences. Of the 15 species tested with characterized exposures, 20% show effects at concentrations < 1 mu g l(-1) while 50% display effects at < 8.6 mu g 1(-1) Sigma PAH(50), concentrations well within the range of reported environmental levels during the spill. Cardiotoxic effects are among the most frequently reported endpoints in DWH oil exposure studies and are thought to have significant downstream effects on fitness and survival. However, additional and possibly cardio-toxic independent impacts on sensory function and behavior are reported at very low exposure concentrations (< 1 mu g l(-1) Sigma PAH(50)) and are clearly deserving of further study. Available information about modes of action leading to different categories of effects are summarized in the present review. An overview of the literature illustrates that early life stages (ELS) are approximately 1-order of magnitude more sensitive than corresponding later life stages, but also illustrates that adults can be impacted at concentrations as low as 4 mu g l(-1) Sigma PAH(50).

Shipwrecks can deteriorate for a number of reasons, including corrosion and physical impact from trawling and other activities, and the probability of a leakage increases with time. Before deciding on possible mitigation measures, there are currently few comprehensive methods for assessing shipwrecks with respect to pollution risks. A holistic method for estimating environmental risks from shipwrecks should be based on well-established risk assessment methods and should take into account both the probability of discharge and the potential consequences. The purpose of this study was therefore to present a holistic risk assessment method for potentially polluting shipwrecks. The focus is set to developing a method for estimating the environmental consequences of potential discharges of hazardous substances from shipwrecks and to combine this with earlier research on a tool for estimating the probability of discharge of hazardous substances. Risk evaluation should also be included in a full risk assessment and is the subject of further research. The consequence assessment was developed for application in three tiers. In Tier 1, the probability of discharge and possible amount of discharge are compared to other shipwrecks. In Tier 2, a risk matrix, including a classification of potential consequences, is suggested as a basis for assessment and comparison. The most detailed level. Tier 3, is based on advanced tools for oil spill trajectory modeling and sensitivity mapping of the Swedish coast. To illustrate the method an example application on two wrecks is presented. Wreck number 1 present a lower probability of discharge and a lower consequence in a Tier 1 and Tier 3 assessment. For the Tier 2 consequence assessment, the two example wrecks present equal consequence. The tool for estimating the probability of discharge of hazardous substances from shipwrecks, and the approach for consequence estimation, offers a comprehensive method for assessing the risks presented by potentially polluting shipwrecks.

Methods and Results A multifactorial controlled microcosm experiment was set up using sediment cores retrieved from an estuarine port area located at Ria de Aveiro lagoon (Aveiro, Portugal). An oil spill with and without chemical dispersant addition was simulated. Sediment oil hydrocarbon concentrations and benthic bacterial community structure were evaluated by GC-MS and 16S rRNA high-throughput sequencing respectively. Although initially (first 10 days) chemical dispersion of oil enhanced the concentrations of the heavier polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and of the C-22-C-30 alkane group, with time (21 days), no significant differences in hydrocarbon concentrations were detected among treatments. Moreover, no significant changes were detected in the structure of sediment bacterial communities, which mainly consisted of operational taxonomic units related to hydrocarbon-contaminated marine environments. We hypothesize that the environmental background of the sampling site preconditioned the communities' response to additional contamination. Conclusion This experimental microcosm study showed that the chemical dispersion of oil did not influence sediment remediation or bacterial community composition. Significance and Impact of the Study Our study showed that chemical dispersion of oil may not improve the remediation of port sediments.

However, we do not possess the same level of understanding of the mechanical and hydraulic processes associated with soil ploughing as we have developed for other soil-structure interaction problems. This means that ploughing schemes and equipment have to be designed on the basis of semi-empirical and conservative approaches, leading to financial uncertainty. In this project, new computational methods will be applied to the simulation of seabed ploughing to provide better estimates of key parameters such as the towing force and speed of ploughing in a given seabed deposit along with insights into plough stability.

Airborne analysis of canopy water content, leaf nitrogen concentration, fractional canopy cover, and vegetation height facilitated mapping of native- and Morella-dominated canopies in rainforest, woodland-savanna and shrubland ecosystems, with Morella detection errors ranging from 0 to 13.4%. Allometric equations were developed to relate the combined LiDAR and spectral data to field-based AGB estimates (r (2) = 0.97, P < 0.01), and to produce a map of biomass stocks throughout native and invaded ecosystems. The structure of the invasive Morella canopies varied by ecosystem type, and the invader shaded out native understory plants in rainforest zones. Despite a 350% increase in AGB going from shrubland to rainforest, Morella did not increase average AGB in any ecosystem it invaded. Furthermore, spatial distributions of biomass indicated that Morella decreased maximum AGB in the woodland-savanna ecosystems. We conclude that Morella tree invasion does not enhance aboveground carbon stocks in any ecosystem it invades in Hawaii, thereby minimizing its contribution to this potentially important ecosystem service.

Studies of short-term behavioural responses to underwater noise associated with aircraft, ships and seismic explorations indicate a 0.5 probability that whales will respond to continuous broadband noise when sound levels exceed ca 120dB2 and to intermittent noise when levels exceed ca 170dB, usually by changing their swimming course to avoid the source. Gray whales were 'startled' at the sudden onset of noise during playback studies, but demonstrated a flexibility in swimming and calling behaviour that may allow them to circumvent increased noise levels. Whales may be 'harassed' by noise from large commercial vessels, especially in shipping lanes or near busy ports. Gray whales sometimes change course and alter their swimming speed and respiratory patterns when followed by whalewatching boats. Conversely, some whales swim toward small skiffs deployed from whalewatching boats in breeding lagoons, seemingly attracted by the noise of idling outboard engines. Reported gray whale reactions to aircraft are varied and seem related to ongoing whale behaviour and aircraft altitude. Whale response to research involving tagging and biopsy sampling appears to be short term. Gray whales were seen swimming through surface oil from the Exxon Valdez oil spill along the Alaskan coast and showed only partial avoidance to natural oil seeps off the California coast. Laboratory tests suggest that gray whale baleen, and possibly skin, may be resistant to damage by oil, but spilled oil or oil dispersant in a primary feeding area could negatively affect gray whales by contaminating benthic prey. Gray whales are sometimes injured or killed in collisions with vessels or entanglement in fishing gear.

Using an exposure probability model as an alternative approach, we estimated that between 36 000 to 670 000 birds died in the offshore Gulf of Mexico as result of exposure to oil from the Deepwater Horizon, with the most likely number near 200 000. Our exposure probability model is a technique for estimating this offshore component of avian mortality as the product of the oil slick area, the density of the birds above the oil slick, and the proportionate mortality of birds that could be exposed to oil during an assumed exposure period. The duration of the exposure period is treated as an estimated parameter to account for oil slick movement, exposure of birds immigrating to the oil-contaminated area, and re-exposure of birds that survived prior vulnerability to exposure. Total avian mortality is determined as the sum of mortalities from each exposure period. Exposure probability may be the only method available to estimate bird mortality from large, remote oil spills in the open ocean where carcasses are unlikely to ever reach shore. In the case of the Deepwater Horizon, the uncertainty interval is quite large because several parameters could not be well estimated.

Carbon storage in wetland soils can be for the long-term and influences whether wetlands will persist during sea level rise by increasing a change in sediment elevation. Climate change and local freshwater management are increasing the movement of saltwater into coastal freshwater wetlands, altering the conditions of the wetlands and causing shifts in the types of vegetation growing there. In many tropical and subtropical coastal wetlands, mangroves are replacing grass-dominated marshes, with uncertain effects on the capability of soils to store carbon. This is especially true of coastal wetlands, because of their sensitivity to sea level rise. The goals of this study are to identify changes in the storage of carbon in wetland soils and releases to the atmosphere of the gases carbon dioxide and methane that occur as coastal wetland change from marshes dominated by grasses to mangrove forests. The research findings will provide valuable information for the conservation and restoration of the Florida Everglades locally as well as coastal wetlands throughout the world. Furthermore, the findings will provide a broader understanding of plant and soil interactions and ecosystem function in a changing world. The project will provide hands on scientific experience identifying and growing wetland plants and restoring urban coastal wetlands for local high school students during Marsh Mangress, an outreach activity at Florida International University. This activity will also provide undergraduate students with laboratory and field experience at a majority minority institution. This research will utilize a vegetation gradient in 10,000 Islands National Wildlife Refuge in Naples, FL in which sea level rise and freshwater manipulation have driven vegetation change and mangrove encroachment, in order to understand how changing abiotic conditions and vegetation state change alter carbon storage through time. Changing carbon storage will be measured as current organic carbon stocks (above and belowground biomass, soil carbon content), inputs (root productivity, sediment surface accretion) and carbon losses (breakdown rates of organic carbon, gas flux measurements), past carbon sequestration rate (radiometric soil dating), and potential future rates of carbon loss (reciprocal transplant of organic matter to represent freshwater restoration or continuing saltwater intrusion). Specifically, the goals of this project are to: 1) Identify differences in carbon storage, accretion, and gas flux among wetlands dominated by brackish marsh, saltwater marsh, and mangrove-dominated vegetation communities. 2) Determine which abiotic and biotic mechanisms drive differences in soil carbon dynamics among wetland types. 3) Quantify the effect of time since mangrove establishment on soil carbon storage, accretion and gas flux by establishing a chronosequence of mangrove encroachment based on soil dating and historic aerial photography.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,1601524,,,,,,,,Florida International University,,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:14011274,,

A key aspect of the Fellowship will be to chart the possibilities, scope and limitations of a wide portfolio of environmental data resources from industry, academic research and the wider environmental community. For the last three decades, EU environmental policies have focused on determining adverse and undesirable changes to the natural system as the result of human activities and on initiating management responses to alleviate impacts (Borja et al. 2009). In addition, resource management, environmental assessment and monitoring primarily focus on single industry sectors in many regions (Queffelec et al. 2009; Kenny et al. 2009). However, there has been a shift in the perception of environmental management in the political agenda, with a move towards an integrative and ecosystem-based management system (EBM), a requirement for quantitative cumulative impact assessment and mapping; and integrated monitoring measures. The environmental research undertaken during the Fellowship will focus on pertinent policy, industry and research questions that may include: (a) what monitoring requirements need to be met for decommissioning; (b) how can recovery be assessed; and (c) will ongoing monitoring be required? A strict legal framework of national, regional and international regulations governs how disused offshore facilities are decommissioned. Presently, and in the coming years and decades, a number of offshore O&G installations will be decommissioned, not only presenting a number of economic issues (Oil & Gas UK forecasts the total cost of decommissioning for existing and sanctioned infrastructure to be £28.7 billion from 2012 onwards); but also a number of significant environmental challenges. The combination of decommissioning issues, new deep-water exploration territories (platforms in deeper water may have probability higher risk of an incident, such as a spill); and the new production techniques, all highlight areas of uncertainty in environmental data management and assessment. Only a coherent environmental data platform will enable assessment and analysis to be conducted efficiently and in the most scientifically rigorous manner. Thus, one of the key activities of this Fellowship includes the development of a web-based mapping portal that incorporates current NERC, industry and other sources of environmental data. This portal will make a transformative difference in data accessibility. The Fellowship will also contribute towards a culture of change with regard to data collation and management. Through close industry liaison and KE, the Fellow will work towards securing industry buy-in to this concept of contributing data directly into the portal at source (e.g. uploaded directly as part of the reporting process). Therefore we anticipate that this KE project will also influence future environmental policy and legislation and facilitate addressing uncertainties surrounding the assessment of licensed activity impacts from exploration through to decommissioning on the environment.Traditionally, marine monitoring around the UK has been limited in scope, in part due to lack of guidance on what, when and how things should be monitored. This is in contrast to, for example, the Norwegian O&G industry which has carried out systematic monitoring of the offshore environment since the ninties (CPA, 2011; OSPAR, 2007) Understanding how Norwegian authorities use their environmental data and lessons learned from the process will be important in determining how best to create the KE platform. Discussions are currently underway to establish Norwegian partnerships, building upon the HWU research team's existing collaborations with the Institute for Marine Research who lead the Norwegian shelf habitat mapping MAREANO programme.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,NE/M006859/1,,,,,,,,Heriot-Watt University,,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:15349013,,

These factors act by influencing the distribution and abundance of the prey, or the shorebirds ability to exploit it. The aims of this study were to investigate the low tide foraging distribution of shorebirds at four sites within the Robbins Passage wetlands, and the environmental and invertebrate factors that may influence their distribution. The greatest densities and number of shorebirds were found at Shipwreck Point and East Inlet. The shorebirds within-site distribution was also non-random, with the shorebirds present in greatest densities at the water's edge and low intertidal stratum, although this varied among species. Generally, on a small spatial scale, invertebrate diversity was positively correlated, and seagrass leaf mass was negatively correlated, with shorebird feeding density. On a large spatial scale, invertebrate biomass and seagrass root mass were positively correlated with shorebird feeding density. Invertebrate biomass and seagrass root mass explained 71% of the variance in total shorebird feeding density on the tidal flats. The variation in shorebird feeding density and diversity was therefore partly explained by invertebrate diversity and biomass, as well as the environmental factors seagrass roots and leaf mass and tidal flat area, although the strength of these relationships was influenced by the two different spatial scales of the study. The strength of the relationships between shorebird feeding density and the invertebrate and environmental variables was stronger on a large spatial scale. The presence of seagrass may have influenced shorebird-feeding density by affecting the invertebrate abundance and composition or the shorebirds ability to detect and capture their prey. The area of the tidal flat had opposing effects on the shorebird species. These results can be used to assist in the development of management plans for the Robbins Passage wetlands and the conservation of important shorebird areas. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Activity-based cost models apply work decomposition methods and knowledge of engineering and market conditions to estimate cost, and although they are the most transparent procedure they require experienced personnel to perform.

The device can be integrated, theoretically, into any type of offshore floating structure, given its simple 3-component design: floating platform, encasing and sliding Power Take-Off. This latter component can be sheltered from the marine environment by being placed within a casing, at deck level, or the hull of the offshore structure. With so much potential for application at sea, it was important to subject the E-Motions to an initial proof-of-concept, as done for other wave energy converters. This paper presents and discusses the main results and conclusions of an experimental study, carried out with a 1:40 reduced scale physical model, aimed at demonstrating the technical and technological viability of the E-Motions. It was found that, for the considered study variables, the device can operate without major incident and convert electricity from wave induced roll oscillations. Four ballast configurations were considered, of which two yielded higher power outputs. The average measured power reached as high as 11 kW and 13 kW, respectively, with the values reducing for wave period further away from the resonance range and lower wave heights. Power Take-Off damping was found to be an important variable that can considerably influence the energy generation process, yet it will be imperative to further assess this variable in combination with other pertinent variables, such as an external attached mass and different generators. This is key to better understand and describe the complex and non-linear relationship between the motions of the Power Take-Off and the floating platform components.",,,,,,,,,13,0,0,0,0,0,13,,,0196-8904,1879-2227,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Porto, Dept Civil Engn, Fac Engn, Rua Dr Roberto Frias,S-N, P-4200465 Porto, PortugalInterdisciplinary Ctr Marine & Environm Res CIIMA, Leixoes Cruise Terminal,Av Gen Norton Matos,S-N, P-4450208 Matosinhos, PortugalMinist Natl Def, Naval Sch, Portuguese Navy, P-2810001 Alfeite, Almada, PortugalUniv Porto, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, Fac Engn, Rua Dr Roberto Frias,S-N, P-4200465 Porto, Portugal",Minist Natl Def,,,2021-01-25,WOS:000603322000003,,

In this study, we adopted the adjoint marginal sensitivity method to predict such parameters based on the information recorded by a limited number of CO2 sensors located on the seafloor. In particular, we newly derived the adjoint marginal sensitivity from the relationship between a source term and the measured concentrations. We successfully conducted two-dimensional tests and three-dimensional simulations with a realistic topography; tidal and ocean currents with CO2 dispersion were time-forwardly simulated and the seepage information was efficiently evaluated via time-backward numerical tests.

However, information on the distribution of these platforms over vast areas of the sea is extremely poor partly because of business secrecy, national interests including security, and partly from bureaucratic inertia. Until recently, the automatic and accurate identification of platforms using optical imagery was challenging due to their subtle characteristics (i.e., low contrast and small size) and prevalent cloud cover. The Landsat-8 satellite, with its increasing Operational Land Imager (OLI) dataset with uniform quality and global coverage, may assist researchers in assessing the worldwide distribution of offshore platforms. Here we describe an automated method, based on time-series of OLI imagery, for extracting offshore platforms (AMEOP) which addresses the aforementioned problems. Specifically, two strategies (time-series and multi-refinement) were designed to address the challenges presented by heavy cloud cover over the sea. Three features documented in the OLI imagery time-series (contextual feature, and position- and size-invariance) were used to accurately discriminate offshore platforms from false positives. The AMEOP was applied to the Gulf of Thailand and 370 offshore platforms were automatically identified using 198 OLI images. Validation using Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images and Chinese high-resolution satellite imagery demonstrated an omission error of 3.8% and a commission error below 1.0%. The AMEOP was also successfully extended to the Persian Gulf and northern Gulf of Mexico, 2346 and 2411 offshore platforms were respectively identified. We believe that the methodology presented herein provides a robust and cost-effective technique for improving the identification of offshore platforms over large areas of the sea; and that the accumulation of OLI data, together with the SAR images, has great potential for mapping and tracking of offshore platforms on a global scale, as well as for providing an early warning of oil spills around platforms and the improved estimation of their greenhouse gas emissions.

It was proposed that bacterial EPS rich in uronic acid is resistant to mineralization by microbes and thus has a long residence time in global oceans. To confirm this hypothesis, bacterial EPS rich in galacturonic acid was isolated from Alteromonas sp. JL2810. The EPS was used to amend natural seawater to investigate the bioavailability of this EPS by native populations, in the presence and absence of ammonium and phosphate amendment. The data indicated that the bacterial EPS could not be completely consumed during the cultivation period and that the bioavailability of EPS was not only determined by its intrinsic properties, but was also determined by other factors such as the availability of inorganic nutrients. During the experiment, the humic-like component of fluorescent dissolved organic matter (FDOM) was freshly produced. Bacterial community structure analysis indicated that the class Flavobacteria of the phylum Bacteroidetes was the major contributor for the utilization of EPS. This report is the first to indicate that Flavobacteria are a major contributor to bacterial EPS degradation.

Model species were two sympatric flatfish, the megrims Lepidorhombus whiffiagonis and Lepidorhombus boscii. Samples obtained before and nine years after the Prestige accident from affected and unaffected areas were genotyped for six hypervariable nuclear markers and for the mitochondrial D-loop sequence. The results revealed a high proportion of post-F1 interspecific hybrids in the area affected, and also increased intraspecific population differentiation likely due to such localized introgression of foreign genes.

Alone, India's power sector is responsible for half of all CO2 emission in the nation and therefore a serious attention is required in this direction to reduce (GHG) emissions in the environment. Presently, Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) act as a bridging technology and a viable option for coal fired power plants to extract CO2.

Here we use multipollutant (NO2, SO2) satellite observations from 2005 to 2017 to quantify gas flaring activity in Mexico's offshore production cluster, which produces similar to 50-70% of the country's oil and is among the world's largest oil fields. We estimate annual flared gas volume ranging from 5.5 to 20 x 10(9) m(3) over the Mexican offshore corresponding to >40% associated gas production, which is significantly larger than for instance offshore United States where reportedly <3% of associated gas is flared. The 13-year record of satellite-derived gas flaring indicates a drastic increase until 2008 and a decline afterward. While the increased flaring is associated with efforts to enhance oil production, the post-2008 decline is linked to an expanding capacity of associated gas utilization, providing a continuing opportunity to reduce flaring for environmental and economic benefits.Plain Language Summary Gas flaring, a commonly used practice in the oil and gas sector to burn off associated natural gas, leads to significant economic loss and emissions of key air pollutants (e.g., SO2 and NO2) and greenhouse gases (e.g., methane and carbon dioxide). Global efforts have been underway to reduce gas flaring, which is considered a viable mitigation option to reduce criteria air pollutants and greenhouse gas emissions, because of technology availability and potential economic gains. In this context, it becomes increasingly important to independently quantify and track gas flaring activity over time, as well as independently evaluate progress in oil/gas regulations and policy implementation, toward mitigation measures. Here we applied a combined analysis of satellite NO2 and SO2 observations over offshore Mexico, one of the world's largest offshore oil production complexes, during 2005-2017.

Observations and collections were made in November 1999 to January 2000 at 24 stations from variety of habitats and environments throughout the bay and from one site at Moku Manu Island outside the bay. A comprehensive literature review of published papers and books and unpublished reports was conducted to develop a listing of previous species reports, and the marine invertebrates, fish, mollusk and algae collections at Bishop Museum were queried for information regarding all organisms that had been collected from Kane'ohe Bay. The assembled data were developed into a relational data base used to determine the 1999-2000 percent component of the total biota that was nonindigenous or cryptogenic, the number of new reports for the bay versus the number of previous reports not found, and a chronology of first reports of introductions. The 1999-2000 surveys observed or collected a total of 786 taxa including 617 species, more than six times the number of taxa previously reported by any single survey of biota in the bay. Of these, 59% of the total taxa and 51% of the named species were new reports for Kane'Ohe Bay after consideration of nomenclatural name changes. However, only 24% of the total taxa previously reported for the bay were found by the present study. This may be due in part to misidentifications in previous studies, non-sampling of meiobiota and plankton by the present study, or actual disappearance of some species from the bay such as the introduced mollusk Haliotis sp. However, the results suggest that further sampling and observation would produce considerably more taxa and species. Historically, 204 nonindigenous or cryptogenic species. Historically, 204 nonindigenous or cryptogenic species (collectively termed NIS) have been reported in Kane'ohe Bay since 1920, and 116 were found on the 1999-2000 surveys, the most that have been determined for any single study in the Hawaiian Islands or Johnston Atoll. In terms of the component of total identified species, NIS composed 18.8%, among the highest percentage components that has been found in Hawai'i and second only to the 23% value that was determined for Pearl Harbor. Fifty-two of the NIS were new reports for the bay. However, all but 16 of the new bay reports had previously been reported in Hawai'i, and those 16 are designated cryptogenic and subject to revision. The distribution of NIS within the bay was concentrated in areas of harbors, piers and docks near the shoreline and on the Coconut Island reef where a metal artificial structure provides settlement opportunity and where introductions of nonindigenous algae have occurred historically. NIS of 25-36 or more occurred at these sites compared to 1-25 NIS at sites in coral rich areas with more open oceanic circulation. A contrasting pattern was found for species richness. Highest numbers of >150 total taxa occurred along the main channel of the bay or at Moku Manu island where corals and coral reef conditions were most dominant and circulation with the open ocean was relatively unrestricted. Sites with <100 total taxa and greatest numbers of NIS occurred inshore areas in harbors, along docks and piers, or in sedimentary areas dominated by nonindigenous or other macroalgae. This pattern of inverse relationship between NIS and species richness corresponds with previous observations in O'ahu's and on coral reef areas elsewhere in the Hawaiian Islands and in tropical areas of the Pacific. Invasive nonindigenous species, i.e. those that have proliferated apparently uncontrolled by environmental conditions or biotic factors somewhere in Hawai'i, are dominated in the bay by five species of macroalgae, four of which were first introduced in Hawai'i into the bay in the 1970s. All five species now occur throughout the bay on reef flats and reefs slopes and often cover large areas of reef, overgrowing or restricting the habitat space available for reef coral or native algae.

Collectively, these nonindigenous marine algae constitute the most serious marine introduction problem for the Hawaiian Islands. Significantly, all but one species were purposely introduced to or redistributed in Hawai'i for aquaculture purposes. Of the four invertebrates and three fishes occurring on these surveys and considered invasive elsewhere in Hawai'i only two species, a stomatopod believed to have entered in the 1950s and an intertidal barnacle that was not present in the early 1970s, occurred frequently within the bay. The remaining NIS were low in abundance and frequency and are not recognizably impacting coral reefs or other relatively undisturbed areas in the bay. Historically, new NIS reports in Kane'Ohe Bay steadily increased from 1920 through the end of the century, with first reports by decade showing distinct peaks in the 1930s, 1960s, 1970s and with the present study. An analysis comparing first reports prior to 1960 to post 1960 could be interpreted to suggest that introductions in the bay have accelerated in the last 40 years, with only 36% of first reports occurring before 1960 compared to 64% post-1960. However, comparing these first NIS reports with first reports for all taxa clearly indicates that the pattern is a reflection of a substantial increase in sampling and identification effort during this same period, with 75% of the 1364 total taxa in the bay been having been first reported after 1960. Furthermore, many of these recent nonindigenous species first reports in Kane'Ohe Bay had previously been reported elsewhere in Hawai'i. Analysis of origins of the Kane'ohe Bay NIS shows a similar pattern as previous studies in Pearl Harbor and the south and west shore harbors of O'ahu, with the majority of species with identifiable origins or distributions coming from the western (17%) or central Indo-Pacific (11%), the latter region equaled by the Caribbean (11%). The study results support a developing paradigm of reduced invasion success in communities with greater species richness, which has been indicated by studies in both tropical and temperate marine systems and in temperate terrestrial communities. This has important management ramifications, since it suggests that an essential means for reducing nonindigenous species proliferation and spread is to restore or maintain environmental conditions that promote ecologically balanced, high diversity communities.

These studies are based on applied computational mechanics associated with field experimentation that has contributed to the technical feasibility of the underground potash mine at the State of Sergipe in Brazil. This knowhow allowed the stability analysis of several salt caverns for brine production at the State of Alagoas in Brazil and to the drilling through stratified thick layers of salt of the pre-salt reservoirs in Santos Basin. Now, this knowledge has been applied in the design of onshore and offshore salt caverns opened by dissolution for storage of natural gas and CO2. The geomechanical study, through the application of computational mechanics, of offshore giant salt caverns of 450 m high by 150 m in diameter, shows that one cavern can store about 4 billion Sm-3 or 7.2 million tons of CO2. Before the construction of the giant cavern, which will be the first gas storage offshore in the world, it has been decided to develop an experimental one, with smaller size, to obtained field parameters. The experimental cavern will allow the calibration of parameters to be used in the structural integrity analysis of the cavern and well for storage of natural gas which is rich in CO2 under high pressure.

We studied distribution of sediment components (sand, silt, clay) organic carbon (OC), heavy metals (Fe, Mn, Cu, Zn, Cr and Co) and pH in six cores collected from one of the largest mudflats of Mandovi estuary, west coast of India. The temporal distribution patterns of these proxies suggested that past changes in tidal energy conditions, fresh water inflow and anthropogenic activities over the last few decades, together helped in development of a middle tidal flat in this estuary. In cores collected from the mangroves, trapping and deposition of finer particles and organic matter were enhanced by a complex aerial mangrove root system in recent years. Mangroves were, therefore, suggested to enhance the buildup of mudflats in Mandovi estuary. Cores collected from mudflats also exhibited higher deposition of finer particles and organic matter (except MF2) in recent years, suggesting maturity and greater stability of the entire mudflat in recent years. Middle tidal flats (mudflats) of Mandovi estuary may, therefore, prove to be suitable substrates for mangrove proliferation in the near future.

J,,,,,,,,,Amanda Coles,,Maximising Efficiency of Resource Usage Under Uncertainty in AI Planning,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Awarded Grant,Apr 19 2010,2010,"In recent years planning technology has a enjoyed significant increase in real-world application, with industry and general science research benefiting from the great depth theoretical work done in this area over many decades. The core problem of deciding which activities to carry out and when occurs in a vast range of domains; the research area of planning is concerned with developing generic problem solving technology that automates the task of performing this core reasoning. Planning technology has been employed in a wide range of domains including controlling printing presses, power management for the UK National, train scheduling on the Hungarian Railway Network, scheduling aircraft landing in airports, and autonomous robotic control, both in space and in the oceans. Experience in these areas has given rise to two key observations. First, the existing theoretical work done in AI Planning has been extremely valuable, allowing planning technology to begin to solve real world problems. Planning is a fundamental component of intelligent autonomous behaviour and as such planning technology has real potential for application in many different areas, both now and in the future. The second is that whilst one can observe that planners can now begin to be applied to these problems, there is still a great need for improvement of the underlying technology, in terms of expressivity and performance, in order to be able to create greater autonomy by allowing reasoning about an uncertain world.At the heart of this lies deeply theoretical computer science research: a planner is a generic problem solving system, consisting of search algorithms and heuristics. Of particular interest is reasoning about time and resources, something key to many areas of computer science, from compilers and programming languages to web services and optimisation. In order to tackle application problems well, reasoning effectively about these is essential. Of specific interest here is uncertainty in time taken and resources consumed. This occurs in many application domains, and in each of these a similar approach is taken: conservatism about time and resource availability in order to guarantee success. This, however, comes at a cost. By way of example, when planning for autonomous Martian exploration, the models used by both the ESA and NASA are pessimistic, underestimating the amount of power the rover will receive from the sun, and overestimating the amount of energy and time each activity will take. The result is that the equipment is highly under-utilised, with fewer science targets being achieved than could have been with better on-board reasoning. Given the expense of placing rovers on Mars and the limited equipment lifespan, this is a great cost to mankind's exploration of space. A similar problem occurs when deploying renewable energy generation: wind farms are assumed to provide 10% of their maximum output, even thought the reality is almost always greater than this. This conservative assumption, there to ensure power is always provided, causes great environmental and economic cost, as extra production capacity must be available through other sources regardless of whether it is required.The major benefit of planning is in generating a generic problem solving technology. Developing several bespoke solvers would take many years, and incur great financial cost. By developing efficient planning systems, a single domain-independent problem-solving core is built, capable of solving many problems without the cost of developing a bespoke solver for each. The core of this research is addressing challenges in solving the general planning problem that will allow future application of planning, extending the range of problems to which this generic technology can be applied.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,EP/H029001/1,,,,,,,,University of Strathclyde,,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:15352512,,

Here we present analytical and numerical models of salt marsh sedimentation that, in addition to capturing inorganic processes, explicitly account for above- and belowground organic processes including root growth and decay of organic carbon. The analytical model is used to examine the bias introduced by organic processes into proxy records of sedimentation, namely Cs-137 and Pb-210. We find that accretion rates estimated using Pb-210 will be less than accretion rates estimated using the Cs-137 peak in steadily accreting marshes if (1) carbon decay is significant and (2) data for Pb-210 extend below the Cs-137 peak. The numerical model expands upon the analytical model by including belowground processes such as compaction and root growth, and by explicitly tracking the evolution of aboveground biomass and its effect on sedimentation rates. Using the numerical model we explore how marsh stratigraphy responds to sediment supply and the rate of sea-level rise. It is calibrated and tested using an extensive data set of both marsh stratigraphy and measurements of vegetation dynamics in a Spartina alterniflora marsh in South Carolina, USA. We find that carbon accumulation in marshes is nonlinearly related to both the supply of inorganic sediment and the rate of sea-level rise: carbon accumulation increases with sea-level rise until sea-level rise reaches a critical rate that drowns the marsh vegetation and halts carbon accumulation. The model predicts that changes in carbon storage resulting from changing sediment supply or sea-level rise are strongly dependent on the background sediment supply: if inorganic sediment supply is reduced in an already sediment poor marsh the storage of organic carbon will increase to a far greater extent than in a sediment-rich marsh, provided that the rate of sea-level rise does not exceed a threshold. These results imply that altering sediment supply to estuaries (e.g., by damming upstream rivers or altering littoral sediment transport) could lead to significant changes in the carbon budgets of coastal salt marshes.

J,,,,,,,,,David Jolley,,"The Boltysh meteorite impact, Ukraine: verification of a KT boundary multi imapct hypothesis.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Awarded Grant,Apr 24 2007,2007,"In the last 25 years, scientists have come to understand the importance of large meteorite impacts on the Earth and other planets in the solar system. Not only are meteorite impacts implicated in mass extinctions, they form traps for oil and gas, and in the early history of the Earth and Mars, they may have been important habitats for life. The Boltysh crater in Ukraine was formed in a very shallow sea on a flat continental shelf 65 million years ago, at the same time as the Chicxulub crater in Mexico, though it has not been possible to determine whether the two happened at exactly the same time. After the impact, the crater was quickly filled with a fresh water lake. Over the next 15 million years the lake filled with fine sediment and the organic remains of the flora and fauna which lived in the lake, or were washed in by rivers. The fact that Boltysh remained a hole in the ground on the flat continental shelf means that it holds a unique and near continuous record of the KT boundary and early Paleogene period. We already know a lot about the crater because it was drilled in the 1960s - 1980s but the core has been lost in subsequent regime changes, apart from a few scattered pieces we have been able to study before starting this work. This project is intended to drill two holes and recover cored sediments from the crater floor up to the point when the sea invaded the crater around 50 million years ago. What can we learn from these sediments ? Firstly, we should be able to establish the age more precisely, and perhaps whether it formed at the KT boundary, predates it or indeed post-dates. Our previous work shows that the Boltysh crater formed within about half a million years of the boundary, but at least one crater of this size (24 km diameter) forms on Earth every 1 million years so it might be coincidence. If it did form at the same time, it would be convincing evidence that several meteorites fell at the KT boundary, and we might have to reconsider our ideas about what happened at the end of the Cretaceous. Even if the two impacts were not simultaneous, we will be able to use signals in the sediments to constrain the KT events. Secondly, sediments deposited soon after impact will tell us how long the crater lake remained hot. This will be an important result because impact craters may have provided an important habitat for life on the early Mars and also possibly on Earth. There were more impacts when the planets were young and warm crater lakes may have been places where early forms of life could survive. A similar study being undertaken in a crater in Africa (Bosumtwi in Ghana) will combined with this work to model crater lakes on early Earth and Mars. Early life is also related to our final aim, which is to use pollen, spores and algae preserved in the sediments to uncover about the processes of devastation and biotic recovery after a significant meteorite impact event. We can do this by recording the fossil plant spores and pollen and algae which tell us about the environments surrounding the lake, and by measuring the variations in organic molecules and carbon isotopes which tell us more about the climate at the time. We know very little about biotic reassembly of a wide sterilised and nutrient poor zone such as Boltysh ejecta blanket, current models being based on smaller volcanogenic landscapes which are not directly analogous because they are richer in nutrients. Studying the Boltysh crater will allow us to produce a detailed model for ecosystem recovery following the impact event, creating a comparator for terrestrial meteorite ejecta fields. Finally, the cores will provide an almost continuous record of the climate in central Europe and Asia. In the future we and other scientists will be able to use it to discover how climate in continental areas relates to the oceanic signal seen elsewhere.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,NE/D005043/1,,,,,,,,University of Aberdeen,,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:15315358,,

JOHN'S,,OCEANS-IEEE,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Proceedings Paper,2014,2014,"Soil mechanical properties of the seabed are related to a number of challenges in the development of ocean renewable energy. Early site assessment is an important part of the development of an ocean renewable energy project, and soil mechanical and sediment dynamical site characteristics should already be addressed at this stage. However, the suitability of the site for the installation of a ocean renewable energy converter (OREC) is still under evaluation and budgets are often strongly limited at this stage of the project. It follows that there is a need for cost-efficient survey strategies. Different methods have been tested in a tidal energy project in the Bay of Fundy, Canada, and a wave energy project in Yakutat, Alaska. Camera systems displayed sediment type, abundance of rocks, plants and small-scale bedforms. Portable free-fall penetrometers were deployed for testing of sediment strength and stratification at the uppermost seafloor. Areas of different sediment strength were identified, and loose, poorly compacted sediment layers quantified. Additionally, rocks and bedrock faces which were covered by a thin sediment layer and remained undetected by seafloor imaging sonars and grab samples, were found. Buried pressure sensors were used in preliminary experiments to monitor pore pressure variations with wave forcing and test the susceptibility to sediment liquefaction. First surveys using these methods attested that they deliver valuable information with regard to sediment and soil mechanical characteristics, while being deployable from local small fishery or harbor authority vessels. Availability of such vessels and devices is high, while purchasing/renting costs are rather low. This allows to perform such tests very cost-effectively, and thus provides a promising strategy for early site assessment in ocean structure engineering before larger budgets are available.",,,,,Oceans ConferenceOceans Conference,"SEP 14-19, 2014SEP 14-19, 2014",,"St Johns, CANADASt Johns, CANADA",13,0,0,0,1,0,13,,,0197-7385,,978-1-4799-4918-2,,,,,,,,,"Virginia Tech, Civil & Environm Engn, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USADalhousie Univ, Dept Oceanog, Halifax, NS B3H 4R2, CanadaFundy Tidal Inc, Westport, NS B0V 1H0, Canada",Fundy Tidal Inc,,,2014-01-01,WOS:000369848800030,,

We propose that RDOC is a concept with a wide continuum of recalcitrance. Most RDOC compounds maintain their levels of recalcitrance only in a specific environmental context (RDOCt). The ocean RDOC pool also contains compounds that may be inaccessible to microbes due to their extremely low concentration (RDOCc). This differentiation allows us to appreciate the linkage between microbial source and RDOC composition on a range of temporal and spatial scales.Analyses of biomarkers and isotopic records show intensive MCP processes in the Proterozoic oceans when the MCP could have played a significant role in regulating climate. Understanding the dynamics of the MCP in conjunction with the better constrained biological pump (BP) over geological timescales could help to predict future climate trends. Integration of the MCP and the BP will require new research approaches and opportunities. Major goals include understanding the interactions between particulate organic carbon (POC) and RDOC that contribute to sequestration efficiency, and the concurrent determination of the chemical composition of organic carbon, microbial community composition and enzymatic activity. Molecular biomarkers and isotopic tracers should be employed to link water column processes to sediment records, as well as to link present-day observations to paleo-evolution. Ecosystem models need to be developed based on empirical relationships derived from bioassay experiments and field investigations in order to predict the dynamics of carbon cycling along the stability continuum of POC and RDOC under potential global change scenarios. We propose that inorganic nutrient input to coastal waters may reduce the capacity for carbon sequestration as RDOC. The nutrient regime enabling maximum carbon storage from combined POC flux and RDOC formation should therefore be sought.",,,,,,,,,130,40,0,0,75,1,148,,,1726-4170,1726-4189,,,,,,,,,,"Xiamen Univ, State Key Lab Marine Environm Sci, Xiamen 361005, Peoples R ChinaUniv E Anglia, Sch Environm Sci, Norwich NR4 7TJ, Norfolk, EnglandUniv Calif San Diego, Scripps Inst Oceanog, La Jolla, CA 92019 USADalhousie Univ, Halifax, NS, CanadaUniv Otago, Dept Marine Sci, Dunedin 9054, New ZealandCSIRO Marine & Atmospher Res, Floreat, WA 6014, AustraliaUniv Delaware, Sch Marine Sci & Policy, Lewes, DE 19958 USAHelmholtz Zentrum Polar & Meeresforsch, Alfred Wegener Inst, D-27570 Bremerhaven, GermanyUniv Paris 06, Sorbonne Univ, UMR7093, Lab Oceanog Villefranche, F-06230 Villefranche Sur Mer, FranceCNRS, UMR7093, Lab Oceanog Villefranche, F-06230 Villefranche Sur Mer, FranceChinese Univ Geol, Wuhan, Peoples R ChinaSwansea Univ, Ctr Sustainable Aquat Res, Swansea, W Glam, WalesColumbia Univ, Dept Appl Phys & Appl Math, New York, NY 10025 USANASA, Goddard Inst Space Studies, New York, NY 10025 USAChinese Acad Sci, South China Sea Inst Oceanol, Guangzhou, Guangdong, Peoples R ChinaTongji Univ, Shanghai 200092, Peoples R China",,,,2014-01-01,WOS:000344153200002,,
J,,,,,,,,,,,EAPSI: Long-term Carbon Storage in Old vs. New Wetland Sediments along Major River Deltas Influenced by Constructed Diversions,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Awarded Grant,Jun 01 2016,2016,"River deltas sequester large amounts of organic carbon (C) that originates from either upstream, as terrestrial mineral sedimentation, or through local marine vegetation that decays and is buried. Diminished sediment supply to river deltas can enhance the erosion and release of this sequestered C within deltaic wetlands, thereby potentially releasing CO2 back to the atmosphere through decomposition of organic matter (OM). The Yellow River (Huanghe) in China is the 2nd largest river in terms of sediment load and 6th in terms of drainage length in the world. The rate and location of sediment deposition in the Yellow River Delta (YRD) have been greatly altered by human actions in recent decades. This award supports research that will examine C burial within two different river courses of the YRD, identify the sources of the buried C, and compare these results to other major river deltas, such as the Mississippi River, to understand C storage variations between global rivers with constructed diversions. Under the supervision of Dr. Xuchen Wang, an expert in C dynamics within coastal wetlands in China and the United States, research will be performed at the Ocean University of China in Qingdao. The results of this study will contribute to the formulation of global management strategies focused on finding a balance between optimizing ecosystem services, such as wildlife habitat, and economic viability, such as commercial fisheries, within major river deltas. Sediment cores will be retrieved from wetlands along current and abandoned river courses within the YRD and analyzed for total organic C, total C, and total nitrogen using a CHN analyzer to quantify buried OM. Sediment and local YRD above and below-ground biomass, such as from Phragmites australis and Suaeda salsa, will be analyzed for ä13C isotopes, using an Isotope Ratio Mass Spectrometer, and n-alkanes, through Gas Chromatography, to determine the sources of the buried OM. Changes in odd-over-even predominance of n-alkanes will be utilized as sediment horizons and used to estimate rates of C burial.

Despite a common view that the Arctic has plentiful of hydrocarbon resources, there are ongoing debates regarding the potential of this region as a future energy supply base. Driving forces for such discussions are geopolitics, environmental concern, assessment and delineation of Arctic resources, technology available for their successful development and the market demand for energy supply.The Russian part is recognized to be the largest among oil and gas resources owned by Arctic nations. However, scarce information and available geological data create uncertainty regarding a future role of the Russian Arctic as main base of energy supply in the second part of the XXI century. A further uncertainty is the pace at which production from northern areas including the Arctic will be brought onstream - either because of national policy, infrastructure development or investment by the state and the oil companies. These areas embrace those where development has already been started (Offshore Sakhalin, northern Timan Pechora) and those awaiting future involvement, like Barents and Pechora seas, East Siberia, Yamal, Kara Sea and Kamchatka.Offhore production levels are likely to be very important to Russia in mid and long terms, especially as most (if not all) production will go for export and, in the process, open doors to new markets. In this way, offshore production will introduce a new and very significant component to Russia's export strategy. However, active involvement of the Russian Arctic resources in the global energy supply process needs a detailed analysis and clear understanding of the market potential for Russian gas and oil (required volumes, time frame, transportations routes) and requires close attention of the government to the most important issues that should be in place, like national standards and guidelines for Arctic resources development, stable, transparent and predictable law as a necessary precondition for massive investments in exploration and production and, not least, active involvement of foreign companies in development of Arctic resources that could bring along with investments an indispensible competence and experience, available technology and Health, Safety and Environment (HSE) principles.Development of oil and gas fields in the arctic seas located few hundreds miles from shore is according to expert opinion the most challenging project in the world.

Anchors comprise a critical component of the mooring system. A variety of anchor types are potentially suitable for this purpose, but all have limitations in regards to the types of seabed soils in which they may be deployed and the type of mooring systems (catenary, taut) for which they are suitable. Additionally, foundations for offshore wind make up a large portion of project cost; therefore, minimizing the costs of fabrication, transport and installation of anchors is a key aspect of overall project feasibility. In contrast to offshore oil-gas installations, offshore wind towers are deployed in arrays, which offer the possibility of reducing project costs by attaching more than one mooring line to a single anchor. In addition to direct cost savings, the multiline anchor concept permits a reduced scale of costly offshore geotechnical site investigations. This paper first examines different anchor types that are potentially suitable as anchors for FOWTs, largely within the context of their traditional usage in securing a single mooring line to the seabed. Then, the potential for adapting these anchors to multiline systems is assessed. Anchor types examined include: driven piles, dynamic piles, suction caissons, drag embedded anchors, vertically loaded anchors, pile driven plate anchors (PDPA), dynamically embedded plate anchors (DEPLA), and suction embedded plate anchors (SEPLA).

The data from the other two cruises were analyzed assuming annual bottom water temperature variation. Heat flow was estimated to be around 90 mW/m^2 in the northernmost Okinawa Trough and lower than 50 mW/m^2 off Shanghai. More measurements are necessary for accurate determination.(2)We deployed a long-term temperature monitoring system on the seafloor to record the bottom water temperature variation, but could not retrieve it due to some fault in the pop-up mechanism.3. We deployed ocean bottom electromagnetometers off Kyushu to determine the electrical conductivity structure. The instruments did not work properly, but we could obtain some magnetic field data, which indicate that some part of the northern Okinawa Trough has relatively low resistivity.4. We also tried to determine heat flow using drill holes.(l) In the East China Sea, we made temperature measurements in shallow holes in one hour after completion of drilling, but the records were too short to be extrapolated to the equilibrium.(2) At the northern margin of the South China Sea, heat flow could be calculated in deep oil/gas wells from temperature logs and thermal conductivity of core samples.5.

Early seral, deciduous vegetation is also extremely beneficial to cervids (e.g., deer and elk) due to high forage quality; questions have been raised about the potential negative impact to deer and elk populations of severely reducing this vegetation in intensively managed stands.Potential negative effects of IFM on both birds and cervids raises the question of whether declines in these species could 'feed back' to negatively influence tree growth and succession in intensively managed plantations.

The objective of this study is to understand how temperature impacts a simplified food web composed of macroalgae and herbivores to quantify the effect on organic carbon storage. The organisms were exposed to a temperature gradient from 5 to 25 degrees C. We measured and modeled primary production, respiration, growth and epiphytic load on the surface of Fucus and respiration, growth and egestion of Idotea. The results show that temperature affects physiological responses of Fucus and Idotea separately. However, Idotea proved more sensitive to increasing temperatures than the primary producers. The lag between the collapse of the grazer and the decline of Fucus and epiphytes above 20 degrees C allows an increase of carbon storage of the primary productivity at higher temperatures. Therefore, along the temperature gradient, the simplified food web stores carbon in a non-monotonic way (reaching minimum at 20 degrees C).

For example, over 20 wrecks from a brief 5-year period in the mid-19(th) Century have been documented at or near tidal inlets along the North Carolina coast alone. Research on tidal inlet dynamics indicates that many of these wrecks are now threatened by a combination of inlet migration, wave scour, and subsequent settling and burial. Fine-scale, subtle changes on the seabed surrounding an exposed wreck can have potentially devastating effects on individual artifacts. and their interrelationships which form the archaeological record. Preservation of important maritime wrecks will depend on our ability to not only map the artifacts, but to understand the physical processes in shallow Water that can cause damage. Acquisition of scientific data over the past 2 decades reveals that many tidal inlets function in predictable ways and that this knowledge can be used to help manage and preserve wreck sites, and to establish a timetable for artifact recovery. We have developed a model for scour and burial that provides insight as to why many shallow-water wrecks are now at significantly greater depths than their initial groundings and why some are buried by sand. Ultimately, artifacts will achieve a depth equal to the maximum level of scour unless they reach an erosion-resistant substrate and the settling process is interrupted.",,,,,1st International Conference on Maritime Heritage1st International Conference on Maritime Heritage,"MAR 24, 2002-MAR 26, 2003MAR 24, 2002-MAR 26, 2003",Wessex Inst Technol; Univ MaltaWessex Inst Technol; Univ Malta,MALTAMALTA,2,0,0,0,0,0,2,,,1368-1435,,1-85312-964-X,,,,,,,,,"Univ N Carolina CH, Inst Marine Sci, Chapel Hill, NC 27514 USA",,,,2003-01-01,WOS:000182316600008,,

A 4-year study was performed to investigate whether storm-generated fragments deposited on beaches can be salvaged and used as transplant source. Specifically, we examined in outdoor tanks (i) how long fragments survive after detachment from parents, (ii) whether fragment survival and regeneration ability are influenced by morphological characteristics, i.e., initial fragment growth form and size, and (iii) whether a single fragment can be divided artificially to obtain more transplants. Finally, we monitored the first year survival of fragments lodged between nibbles of a submersed artificial reef 3 years after storage in tanks to test for their capacity to re-establish in the field. Four months after collection, fragment survival was high (80-96%). Half of the fragments regenerated and survived as long as 3 years in tanks. Initial growth form and size were not predictors of fragment survival or regeneration probability. Division of fragments allowed doubling transplant number. One year after transplanting, 50% of the fragments on the artificial reef were still present and ca. half of them produced new shoots. This indicates that fragments retain the capacity to re-establish once reintroduced into the field and thus could represent a potentially important transplant source. The use of this material could have major advantages over traditional restoration techniques, including large availability with zero impact on existing populations and low collection efforts.

The estate also supports a globally unique and diverse biota that contributes important ecosystem services that need to be protected. The new EEZ Bill and the Crown Minerals Act provide the framework for environmentally sustainable exploration and exploitation of offshore mineral resources, but there is currently no process to evaluate and manage the effects of these activities, which the public perceives as high risk. In contrast, on land there is a well-established and developed structure in place for assessing and managing mining operations, backed by the Resource Management Act. Our research programme, developed in partnership with the mining industry, government agencies, iwi and NGOs, aims to develop, validate and implement science-based guidelines for effective environmental management of off-shore mineral and hydrocarbon extraction. The guidelines will be based on both Environmental Risk Assessment and Environmental Impact Assessment processes, the results of which will assist development of effective environmental management plans. The project will identify gaps in our understanding of the environmental impacts of offshore mineral and hydrocarbon extraction, and will address some critical gaps already known. These include modelling sediment and contaminant plumes from mining operations, quantifying potential chemical pollution from seafloor disturbance, and defining the spatial extent of ecological impact. Priorities for future research to guide improved understanding and management of environmental impacts will be identified, including techniques developed with the industry to avoid or mitigate risks. Finally, the project will develop monitoring approaches and provide advice on aspects of spatial management of exploited and protected areas where there are potential conflicts of resource use.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,C01X1228,,,,,,,,National Institute of Water and Atmospheric Research Limited,National Institute of Water and Atmospheric Research Limited,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:16297090,,

In the past, multiphase medium- and low-resolution optical or radar images have been used to remove the interference of ship targets based on the static position of a platform to extract the offshore platform, resulting in large demands and high image data costs. According to the difference in shape between offshore platforms (not elongated) and ships (elongated shapes) in SAR (synthetic aperture radar) images, this paper proposes an automatic extraction method for offshore platforms in single SAR images based on a dual-step-modified model. First, the two-parameter CFAR (constant false alarm rate) algorithm was used to detect the possible offshore platform targets; then, the Hough transform was introduced to detect and eliminate ship targets with linear structures. Finally, the final offshore platform was obtained. Experiments were carried out in four study areas in the Beibu Gulf basin and the Pearl River estuary basin in the northern South China Sea. The results show that the method has a good extraction effect in the above research area, and the extraction accuracy rate of offshore platforms is 86.75%.

The study is conducted using a questionnaire consisting of safety indicators for offshore operation identified from literature review and consultation with industrial experts. The respondents were required to rate the importance of indicators and the probability of incidents occurring due to failure to observe the indicators. The study shows that emergency management, start-ups and shut down system as well as documentation have the highest importance in safety performance of offshore operation. Incidents or errors are more likely to occur if indicators with higher importance are not observed.

However, understanding social data, including people's values and preferences, is critical to both effective planning and management and long-term MPA success. Having these social data in a spatial form is essential, given that MPA planning and management increasingly uses marine spatial planning (MSP) approaches to carefully locate and mediate among potentially competing uses in both space and time. An online Public Participation GIS (PPGIS) survey was used to collect spatially explicit information on stakeholder values and management preferences for Australia's remote Kimberley region. The Kimberley coast and marine environment is characterised by a multiplicity of values and preferences. Key values included biological conservation, aesthetics, recreational fishing, Aboriginal culture and heritage, and nature based tourism. Management preferences were dominated by the desire to increase conservation/protection, exclude oil/gas development and commercial fishing, and to increase Aboriginal management. The diversity of values and preferences present suggests potential for conflict over management and permitted uses. Significant associations between value and preference distribution and the Kimberley's five marine protected areas were analysed. Accessibility and respondent familiarity appear linked to value attribution. More accessible MPAs were significantly associated with recreation values while more remote MPAs were characterised by a conservation ethos and general aversion to development. Our research demonstrates that PPGIS enables documentation of spatially explicit social data across large scales, highlighting potential synergies and conflicts in values and permitted uses, in a manner that can readily integrate with ecologically based marine spatial planning processes.

Nitrogen fertilizer production helps meet this need. However, adding excess nitrogen drastically alters natural habitats such as salt marshes and others that receive water as runoff from land. Coastal wetlands provide several ecosystem services, including nursery habitat for fish and birds, storm surge protection, and nutrient filtration. Prior studies suggest that excess nitrogen may increase decomposition in these sediments, resulting in faster degradation of complex organic matter to carbon dioxide. What controls these processes, and the micro-organisms responsible for them is not well understood. This doctoral dissertation improvement project will use controlled laboratory experiments to investigate the mechanisms behind the effect of added nitrogen on organic matter decomposition. This research will provide an in-depth analysis of the members of the salt marsh microbiome and their activities in marsh sediments. Data will provide insight into how salt marshes are responding to nitrogen fertilizer runoff, information that is essential for the adaptive management of coastal wetland systems and their response to environmental change. This doctoral dissertation improvement project will use controlled flow through reactor systems to investigate the mechanistic effect of nitrate on microbial decomposition of salt marsh sediment organic matter. We hypothesize that, because nitrate is a favorable electron acceptor in heterotrophic, microbial respiration, it can promote oxidation of organic matter that would otherwise remain unprocessed. Current biogeochemical data indicate a significant increase in microbial respiration, particularly denitrification, in response to nitrate addition, with the most pronounced effect in deep sediments ranging from 150 to 200 years old. This is significant, because organic matter at this depth is typically thought to be more resistant to microbial degradation, which means that the capacity of salt marshes to store carbon may lessen with eutrophication. To further assess these results, we need to gain a better understanding of the microbial consortia responsible for organic matter decomposition. Microbial activity plays a critical role in controlling how much carbon is decomposed; though we know little about salt marsh sediment microbiome structure and function, and how it may change in response to nitrate addition. Accordingly, this dissertation improvement grant will contribute to existing data by taking an integrated 'meta-omics' approach. To complement flow through reactor experiments, the microbial genetic underpinnings of organic matter decomposition under conditions of nutrient enrichment will be investigated using metagenomics, and the metabolic activity of these microbial players will be assessed by measuring the expression of the microbial metatranscriptome. These data have the potential to reveal novel microbial lineages from deep salt marsh sediment, and draw unique linkages between microbial gene expression patterns and changes in organic carbon quality. Successful integration of these meta-omics approaches with existing geochemical rate measurements will vastly improve our understanding of the role of microbes in organic matter decomposition, and potentially allow for a better predictive understanding for how carbon storage capacity in salt marshes will respond to future nitrogen loading.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,1701748,,,,,,,,Northeastern University,,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:13948785,,

We conducted a field investigation of temporal variability in sediment flux in tidal creeks in the accreting tidal marsh at China Camp State Park adjacent to northern San Francisco Bay. Suspended-sediment concentration (SSC), velocity and depth were measured near the mouths of two tidal creeks during three 6- to 10-week deployments: two in winter and one in summer. Currents, wave properties and SSC were measured in the adjacent shallows. All deployments spanned the largest spring tides of the season. Results show that tidally averaged suspended-sediment flux (SSF) in the tidal creeks varied from slightly landward to strongly bayward with increasing tidal energy. SSF was negative (bayward) for tidal cycles with maximum water surface elevation above the marsh plain. Export during the largest spring tides dominated the cumulative SSF for each deployment. During ebb tides following the highest tides, velocities exceeded 1ms(-1) in the narrow tidal creeks, resulting in negative tidally averaged water flux, and mobilizing sediment from the creek banks or bed. Storm surge also produced negative SSF. Tidally averaged SSF was positive in wavy conditions with moderate tides. Spring tide sediment export at the creek mouth was about twice that at a station 130m further up the tidal creek. The negative tidally averaged water flux near the creek mouth during spring tides indicates that in the lower marsh some of the water flooding directly across the bay-marsh interface drains through the tidal creeks, and suggests that this interface may be a pathway for sediment supply to the lower marsh as well.

Sedimentary environments off the eastern end of the shoal are characterized by processes associated with long-term erosion or nondeposition, a mobile-sediment-limited seafloor armored by gravelly sand, and scattered elongate fields of barchanoid sand waves. The barchanoid waves reach amplitudes of 20 m, are concave westward, and occur in individual and coalesced forms that become progressively more complex westward. The seafloor on and adjacent to the shoal is characterized by processes associated with coarse bedload transport and covered primarily with asymmetrical transverse sand waves. The transverse waves exceed 8 m in amplitude, have slip faces predominantly oriented to the west and southwest, and have straight, slightly sinuous, and curved crests. Megaripples, which mimic the asymmetry of the sand waves, are commonly present on stoss slopes and in troughs; current ripples are ubiquitous. The amplitude and abundance of large bedforms decrease markedly westward of Six Mile Reef. The seabed there is covered with small, degraded ripples, reflecting lower-energy environments and processes associated with sorting and reworking of seafloor sediments.Megaripples and current ripples on the sand waves suggest that transport is active and that the bedforms are propagating under the present hydraulic regime. Net bedload sediment transport is primarily to the west, as evidenced by textural trends of surficial sediments, orientation of the barchanoid waves, and asymmetry of the transverse waves and of the scour marks around bedrock outcrops, boulders, and shipwrecks. One exception occurs at the western tip of the shoal, where sand-wave morphology indicates long-term eastward transport, suggesting that countercurrents in this area shape the shoal and are important to its maintenance.",,,,,,,,,3,0,0,0,2,0,3,,,0749-0208,1551-5036,,,,,,,,,,"US Geol Survey, Woods Hole, MA 02543 USANOAA, Atlantic Hydrog Branch, Norfolk, VA 23510 USAConnecticut Dept Environm Protect, Hartford, CT 06106 USA",Connecticut Dept Environm Protect,,,2008-01-01,WOS:000252592600024,,

Offshore Oil and Gas production and thermal modeling of buried pipelines in arctic regions are challenging tasks due to environmental conditions and hazards. Flow properties of Oil and Gas flowing through the pipelines in arctic regions are also affected due to freezing around pipelines. Solid formation in the production path can have serious implications on production. Heavy components of crude oil start to precipitate as wax crystal when the fluid temperature drops. Gas. hydrates also form when natural gas combines with free water at high pressure and low temperature. Pipeline burial and trenching in some offshore developments are now one of the prime methods to avoid ice gouge, ice cover, icebergs, and other threats. Long pipelines require more thermal management to deliver production to the sea surface. Significant heat loss may occur from offshore buried pipelines in the forms of heat conduction and natural convection through the seabed. The later Can become more prominent where the backfill soil is loose or sandy. The aim of this paper is to provide an insight of modeling and conducting the experiments using different parameters with numerical analysis results support to investigate the heat loss from offshore buried pipelines. This paper also provides validation of the outputs from benchmark tests with analytical models available for theoretical shape factor at constant temperature and constant heat flux boundary conditions. These theoretical models have limitatimis such as the assumption of uniform soil properties around the buried pipeline, isothermal outer surface of the buried pipeline and soil surface. Degree of saturation of surrounding medium can play a significant role in the thermal behavior of fluid travelling through the backfill soil. This paper presents several steady states and transient response analysis describing some influential geotechnical parameters along with test procedures and numerical simulations using CFD to model the heat loss for different parameters such as burial depth, backfill soil, trench geometries etc. This paper also shows the transient response for several shutdown (cooldown) tests performed in the saturated sand medium. The statistical and uncertainty analysis performed from the experimental outputs also ensure the legitimacy of the experimerital model. The outcomes of this research will provide valuable experimental data and numerical predictions for offshore pipeline design, heat loss from buried pipelines in offshore conditions, and efficient model to mitigate the flow assurance issues e.g. wax and hydrates.",,,,,ASME International Mechanical Engineering Congress and Exposition (IMECE2016)ASME International Mechanical Engineering Congress and Exposition (IMECE2016),"NOV 11-17, 2016NOV 11-17, 2016",Amer Soc Mech EngineersAmer Soc Mech Engineers,"Phoenix, AZPhoenix, AZ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,978-0-7918-5062-6,,,,,,,,,"Mem Univ Newfoundland, St John, NF, CanadaC CORE, St John, NF, Canada",C CORE,,,2017-05-31,WOS:000400877900064,,

Although traditional laws of salvage and finds had served to solve legal problems raised by recovery of artifacts, international community has become more interested on protection rather than commercial recovery of underwater cultural heritage. With the conclusion and entry into effect of international agreements affecting underwater heritage, we have to courts consider many different areas of law to decide on legal status of ancient artifacts and shipwrecks located on the seafloor : international law of the sea, sovereign immunity law, law of salvage, and law of finds.The Law of the Sea Convention incorporated only 2 articles on legal status of underwater cultural heritage. The convention conferred coastal states jurisdiction over underwater heritage in territorial sea and contiguous zone, but underwater artifacts located in Exclusive Economic Zone(EEZ) and on the continental shelf are left unregulated.The 2001 Convention on the Protection of the Underwater Cultural Heritage which came into effect in 2009 was adopted to fill a gap left by the LOS Convention. This convention introduced more concrete definitions on important terms to define the scope of application. This convention also introduced provisions governing the legal status of underwater cultural heritages which are located in territorial sea, contiguous zone, EEZ, continental shelf of any coastal state and which are found in the Area.There have been controversy over the legal status of the sunken state vessels and aircraft including warships. Some states maintained that the special legal status and immunities attributable to warships could not be changed due to pass of time without express consent by the flag state. Other states have insisted that it is not acceptable to provide the sunken warships the special legal status such as privileges and immunities suitable only for operable military craft.Situated between the Eurasia Continent and the Japan, Korea is a peninsular state with a history of five thousand years. Given the fact that the seas in the East Asia are shallow and semi-enclosed and that there had been brisk trade between east asian states, the Yellow Sea and the East China Sea have been regarded one of the most important area rich in underwater cultural heritages. Noting international law principles stipulated in the LOS Convention and the Underwater Cultural Heritage Convention, Korea should prepare for a new legal system for the protection of underwater heritages.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,1226-6159,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2011-01-01,KJD:ART001523520,,

This requires design and construction of long high temperature and high pressure pipelines from deep sea to shore. These pipelines are subjected to cyclic expansion during operating cycles. Accumulated axial movement due to repeated thermal cycles may lead to global displacement referred to as 'walking'. Walking rates depend on the restraint associated with seabed friction. In conventional analyses, seabed friction is independent of the rate of thermal loading and expansion but it has been recognised that the sliding resistance between a pipe and the seabed varies with velocity, partly due to drainage effects. In this paper a numerical model is used to explore the effect of velocity-dependent seabed friction. A velocity-dependent friction model is implemented in commercial software ABAQUS and validated via single element and simple (flat seabed) pipeline cases. This model features upper and lower friction limits, with a transition that occurs as an exponential function of velocity. A parametric study is performed using differing rates of heating and cool-down in walking situations driven by seabed slope, SCR end tension and the difference between heat up and cool down rates. The walking behaviour is compared to cases with constant friction and solutions are proposed to express the velocity-dependent response in terms of an equivalent constant friction. These equivalent friction values can then be applied in existing simple solutions or more complex numerical analyses, as a short cut method to account for velocity-dependent friction.",,,,,,,,,14,1,0,0,0,0,15,,,0141-1187,1879-1549,,,,,,,,,,"Karachaganak Petr Operating BV, Shell Offshore Serv BV, Aksay, KazakhstanUniv Southampton, Southampton SO17 1BJ, Hants, EnglandUniv Western Australia, Perth, WA, AustraliaUniv Western Australia, Ctr Offshore Fdn Syst, 35 Stirling Highway, Perth, WA 6009, Australia",Karachaganak Petr Operating BV,,,2019-02-19,WOS:000457819700024,,

These polyps were subdivided into three replicate groups of similar to 120 polyps and maintained in waters with flow velocities of 2.5 cm s(-1) or 5.0 cm s(-1). Suspended Artemia sauna nauplii food concentrations of between 345 and 1035 A. sauna l(-1) were introduced. L pertusa net capture rates were assessed by monitoring the reduction in suspended A. sauna concentration in each flume over 24 h. Maximum net capture rates were higher in flumes with a 2.5 cm s(-1) flow regime, at 73.3 +/- 2.0 A. salina polyp(-1) h(-1) (mean +/- SD) than those with 5 cm s(-1) flow (19.8 +/- 11.8 A. sauna polyp(-1) h(-1)). Maximum net capture rates were lower in flumes with A. sauna densities of <690 A. salina l(-1) than in flumes with higher food densities under comparable flow velocities. The maximum net capture rates observed represent maximum carbon capture rates of 66.4 +/- 2.0 mu g C polyp(-1) h(-1) and 17.9 +/- 10.7 mu g C polyp(-1) h(-1) under 2.5 and 5 cm(-1) s(-1) flow speeds respectively.

Besides to the direct effects of the CO2-associated pH decrease, the possible effects on marine sediment toxicity were studied by exposing the urchin larvae to elutriate of sediments with different metals concentration, which were subjected to various pH treatments.

The direction and magnitude of this effect can be a function of the invaders density and the service(s) of interest. We assessed the density-dependent effect of an invasive marsh grass, Phragmites australis, on three ecosystem services (plant diversity and community structure, shoreline stabilization, and carbon storage) in two oligohaline marshes within the North Carolina Coastal Reserve and National Estuarine Research Reserve System (NCNERR), USA. Plant species richness was equivalent among low, medium and high Phragmites density plots, and overall plant community composition did not vary significantly by Phragmites density. Shoreline change was most negative (landward retreat) where Phragmites density was highest (-0.40 0.19 m yr-1 vs. -0.31 0.10 for low density Phragmites) in the high energy marsh of Kitty Hawk Woods Reserve and most positive (soundward advance) where Phragmites density was highest (0.19 0.05 m yr-1 vs. 0.12 0.07 for low density Phragmites) in the lower energy marsh of Currituck Banks Reserve, although there was no significant effect of Phragmites density on shoreline change. In Currituck Banks, mean soil carbon content was approximately equivalent in cores extracted from low and high Phragmites density plots (23.23 2.0 kg C m-3 vs. 22.81 3.8). In Kitty Hawk Woods, mean soil carbon content was greater in low Phragmites density plots (36.63 10.22 kg C m-3) than those with medium (13.99 1.23 kg C m-3) or high density (21.61 4.53 kg C m-3), but differences were not significant. These findings suggest an overall neutral density-dependent effect of Phragmites on three ecosystem services within two oligohaline marshes in different environmental settings within a protected reserve system. Moreover, the conceptual framework of this study can broadly inform an ecosystem services-based approach to invasive species management.

In the next 50 years many more of these offshore devices (wind, wave, current and oil & gas) will be installed, meaning that considerably more seabed ploughing will be undertaken. However, we do not possess the same level of understanding of the mechanical and hydraulic processes associated with soil ploughing as we have developed for other soil-structure interaction problems. This means that ploughing schemes and equipment have to be designed on the basis of semi-empirical and conservative approaches, leading to financial uncertainty. In this project, new computational methods will be applied to the simulation of seabed ploughing to provide better estimates of key parameters such as the towing force and speed of ploughing in a given seabed deposit along with insights into plough stability. Given the likely ploughing activity in the next 20-50 years in UK waters and elsewhere, we expect that this new predictive approach will result in major savings for industry.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,EP/M000397/1,,,,,,,,Durham University,,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:15383215,,

Stochastic calculations that were performed for three typical seasonal weather variations of the year 2015, three oil release sites and specific oil characteristics, showed that there is a considerable probability of oil pollution that reaches 30% in the Mesolongi - Aitoliko lagoons. Based on a simplified approach regarding the characteristic of the sensitive birds and fish in the lagoons, deterministic calculations showed that 78-90% of the bird population and 2-4% of the fish population are expected to be contaminated in the case of an oil spill without any intervention. The use of dispersants reduced the amount of stranded oil by approximately 16-21% and the contaminated bird population of the lagoons to approximately 70%; however, the affected fish population increased to 6-8.5% due to the higher oil concentration in the water column. Mechanical recovery with skimmers cleaned almost 10% of the released oil quantity, but it did not have any noticeable effect on the stranded oil and the impacted bird and fish populations.

This presentation of uncertainty is limited in its provision of context, and as an overall picture of how costs and uncertainty vary over time. This study aims to address these two shortcomings. Two analyses are performed using reported DECC LCOE estimates for three important electricity generation technologies for the UK; nuclear, offshore wind and coal with carbon capture and storage. The first analysis composes LCOE estimate trajectories from previous years' DECC estimates and presents them alongside contextual data, including some out-turn costs. The second quantifies the variability presented in the LCOE estimate trajectories for commissioning dates in the decade 2020-2030. Nuclear costs are presented as both the most consistent and lowest in magnitude. An imminently forecast steep fall in the LCOE of offshore wind raises questions about the timing of investment and deployment. In most cases estimate variability decreases over the estimation horizon, strangely suggesting greater levels of certainty for further flung commissioning dates. Further observations and implications for policy stemming from the analyses are discussed. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

However, this information is crucial to understanding the effects these devices have on the marine environment and to judge their potential as a mitigation measure. A study was conducted in the German North Sea, using passive acoustic monitoring and to some extent simultaneous aerial surveying to specifically study the spatial extent of the deterrence effects of a seal scarer on harbour porpoises. In order to link porpoise detections at various distances to actual sound levels, sound measurements of the seal scarer signal were carried out at several distances from the source. C-POD recordings revealed a significant deterrence effect on harbour porpoises up to 7.5 km away (at about 113 dB re 1 Parms), much further than previously reported. During seal scarer operation the number of porpoise detections within 750 m of the C-PODs decreased by between 52 and 95% of the value before the seal scarer was activated. An aerial survey revealed a significant decrease in porpoise density from 2.4 porpoises km-2 before to 0.3 porpoises km-2 during seal scarer operation within the 990 km2 study area, showing that the decrease in porpoise detections by passive acoustic monitoring was probably indeed the result of a decrease in porpoise abundance. These results may raise serious concerns about unwanted disturbance effects on harbour porpoises in the context of seal scarer use at fish farms and also highlight the need for caution when applied as a mitigation measure during offshore construction.Copyright (c) 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",,,,,,,,,32,0,0,0,31,0,34,,,1052-7613,1099-0755,,,,,,,,,,"BioConsult SH, D-25813 Husum, GermanyInst Tech & Appl Phys Itap, D-26129 Oldenburg, Germany",BioConsult SHInst Tech & Appl Phys Itap,,,2013-05-29,WOS:000317678300007,,

On-board maintenance activities carried out by seafarers/operators are often prone to error, leading to an accident. Marine environmental and operational conditions significantly affect human performance and influence seafarers/operators to make un-intentional errors. International Maritime Organization (IMO) guidance recommends implementing Human Error Assessment and Reduction Technique (HEART) for assessing the effect of human error probability considering quantitative risk analysis of shipping and offshore operations. The conventional HEART is not specifically developed to apply to marine and offshore operations and therefore it is necessary to develop an operational specific methodology capturing unique features of marine environment and operations. In this study, by revising and modifying the HEART to assess and quantify the potential human errors in different marine environmental and operational conditions, a new methodology is developed. As a part of the developed methodology, the Error Producing Condition (EPC) and Error Influencing Factor (EIF) tables are refined and developed to reflect the particular conditions of marine environments for Human Error Probability (HEP) estimation. The EIF tables for both engine and deck departments are developed separately considering the answers to a questionnaire survey among experienced seafarers from around the world. As the case studies the developed methodology is applied to the maintenance procedures of a marine engine exhaust turbocharger and also a condensate pump on an offshore oil and gas facilities. Application of the developed methodology confirms that extreme weather, extreme workplace temperature, high ship motion, high level of noise and vibration, and work overload and stress increase the likelihood of human error as well as potential accidents. It is intended that application of this developed methodology in human factor risk assessment will assist in improving the safety and reliability of the current maintenance practices in marine and offshore operations.",,,,,,,,,61,3,0,0,1,0,62,,,0950-4230,1873-3352,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Tasmania, AMC, NCMEH, Launceston, Tas 7250, AustraliaMem Univ Newfoundland, Proc Engn Dept, C RISE, A1B3X5, St John, NF, Canada",,,,2017-11-01,WOS:000419407900012,,

While a number of technological options are available, many of the most promising CO2 capture systems take advantage of biological systems and are thus driven by light energy. Sulfur offers an alternative energy source for biological carbon capture. Herein, system models are presented that use reduced sulfur to power marine chemosynthetic carbon capture, with four proposed alternatives for the management of the produced biomass and sulfate. These four alternatives differ in the energy and process used to reduce the sulfate produced by the growth of the microorganisms back to sulfur or sulfide and in sum, the four systems create direct air carbon capture systems that utilize either geologic reduced sulfur, electricity, or biomass as energy sources. Thus, three new energy sources for direct air carbon capture are identified.",,,,,,,,,2,0,0,0,1,0,2,,,2194-4288,2194-4296,,,,,,,,,,"Louisiana State Univ, Dept Environm Sci, Baton Rouge, LA 70803 USA",,,,2019-10-04,WOS:000486696700001,,

Divers surveyed 11 wrecks and found the remains of 27 separate gillnets (lost from the fishery) distributed among 7 of the wrecks. No animals (alive or dead) were found entrapped in any of these gillnet remains, whose fishing capacities were estimated to be negligible. Two gillnets were deployed and deliberately abandoned, one over a wreck and another on open ground. They were subsequently monitored for 2 years by divers. Both demonstrated a loss in fishing capacity of more than 50% during the first few weeks of immersion. The open ground net was washed ashore after 58 days, while the wreck net remained in situ and continued to fish, albeit with decreasing capacity, over 2 years. The study supports the general view that lost/abandoned gillnets in UK coastal waters are an insignificant source of unaccounted fishing mortality and do not present an ecological hazard whether deployed over wrecks or on open fishing ground.

This legacy's value, in terms of mitigating anthropogenic emissions of CO2, is based on total organic carbon (TOC) inventories to a depth likely to be disturbed. However, failure to subtract allochthonous recalcitrant carbon overvalues the storage service. Simply put, burial of oxidation-resistant organics formed outside of the ecosystem provides no additional protection from remineralisation. Here, we assess whether black carbon (BC), an allochthonous and recalcitrant form of organic carbon, is contributing to a significant overestimation of blue carbon stocks. To test this supposition, BC and TOC contents were measured in different types of seagrass and mangrove sediment cores across tropical and temperate regimes, with different histories of air pollution and fire together with a reanalysis of published data from a subtropical system. The results suggest current carbon stock estimates are positively biased, particularly for low-organiccontent sandy seagrass environs, by 18 +/- 3% (+/- 95% confidence interval) and 43 +/- 21% (+/- 95% CI) for the temperate and tropical regions respectively.

The California Current Predator Diet Database (CCPDD) synthesizes data from published records of predator food habits over the past century. The database includes diet information for 100+ upper-trophic level predator species, based on over 200 published citations from the California Current region of the Pacific Ocean, ranging from Baja, Mexico to Vancouver Island, Canada. We include diet data for all predators that consume forage species: seabirds, cetaceans, pinnipeds, bony and cartilaginous fishes, and a predatory invertebrate; data represent seven discrete geographic regions within the CCS (Canada, WA, OR, CA-n, CA-c, CA-s, Mexico). The database is organized around predator-prey links that represent an occurrence of a predator eating a prey or group of prey items. Here we present synthesized data for the occurrence of 32 forage species (see Table 2 in the affiliated paper) in the diet of pelagic predators (currently submitted to Ecological Informatics). Future versions of the shared-data will include diet information for all prey items consumed, not just the forage species of interest.

In order to find out the features of stratigraphic framework and the control mechanism of its inner sedimentary microtopography to the reef-bank complex reservoir, we established the high frequency sequence stratum framework of Upper Ordovician Lianglitage Formation in this paper, based on the analysis of lithology, depositional microfacies, welwitschiopsida and logging curves. The framework can be divided into 11 four-stage sequences and multiple five-stage sequences. The second and third passages of Lianglitage Formation mainly deposited in highstand systems tract, which is characterized by continuous vertical accretion and is the main developmental phase of reef (mound) and bank combination rimmed deposits. One or more sedimentary microtopography cycles of reef-bank complex can be developed in a four-stage sequence. The thickness and scale of reefal microtopography are controlled by secondary eustatic sea level change cycles and tectonic subsidence. According to the analysis of diagenetic fabric and diagenetic environment, We believe that the atmospheric diagenetic lens formed during syngenetic karst is mainly distributed in the top of upward shallowing cycle and highland of microtopography. Exposition controlled by reefal microtopography uplift in the same sequence and sea level change in the relative movements, with dissolution and eluviation of syngenetic atmospheric fresh water are the key factors for not only the favorable reservoir development of reef-bank complex in the platform edge, but also the difference between sequences and zones.

Uncertainty arises from variable distributional shifts of species' ranges due to climate change. The planning framework consists of a two-stage optimization model that selects a nominal conservation area network in the first stage and evaluates its performance under the climate scenarios in the second stage. The model is applied to eleven at-risk species in Alaska including the threatened Spectacled Eider and Steller's Eider sea ducks and the polar bear. The 109th United States Congress and 2008 federal budget proposed opening for oil and gas development the 1002 Area of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, which intersects the Plain. This analysis finds that, if Arctic Alaska experiences 1.5 degrees C of warming by 2040 (as predicted by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's A2 scenario), then potential habitat will decrease significantly for eight of these at-risk species, including the polar bear. This analysis also shows that there is synergism between oil and gas development and climate change. For instance, climate change accompanied by no development of the 1002 Area results in an increase of potential habitat for Steller's Eider. However, if development accompanies climate change, then there is a 20% decrease in that area. Further, this analysis quantifies the tradeoff between development and maintenance of suitable habitat for at-risk species. (c) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

DISCO will support research in a range of science and engineering areas including wind energy, ocean circulation, materials by design, additive manufacturing, big data, genomics, and biological function on membrane to organ scales. It provides a framework for creating new data from simulations, analyzing data, and making data available for analysis by remote users. DISCO will also enable the development and sharing of new code and data analysis methods across institutions. This project addresses two of NSF's big ideas: Growing Convergence Research and Harnessing the Data Revolution, as well as the Materials Genome initiative. DISCO will immediately support over 40 faculty research projects involving over 200 scientists. DISCO will be managed in collaboration with Morgan State University, a historically black university, which will be allocated at least 5% of resources to support its educational and computational research programs. Other users nationally will be offered 20% of the resources to be managed through a partnership with XSEDE. Opportunities for training on a diverse set of scientific computing topics will be directly integrated into regular courses across JHU and Morgan State. Courses on computational chemistry, genomics, molecular dynamics, machine learning and protein chemistry are planned. Course materials will be made available through the web and the existing set of Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) at JHU will be expanded. These materials will ensure training in the proper use of resources, share best practices between different disciplines and promote interdisciplinary collaboration. The objective of this Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) project is to create a Data Intensive Scientific Computing (DISCO) environment that integrates high performance computing with tools for generating, analyzing and disseminating data sets of ever increasing size. The cluster will contain over 5 petabytes of storage and heterogeneous compute nodes optimized for different research projects and complex, optimized work flows: standard dual processor nodes, large memory nodes, and Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) enhanced nodes. An instance of SciServer software will enhance analysis and provide a platform for disseminating data through a web portal. This robust capability will become a powerful resource for developing and sharing code and infrastructure tools used by interdisciplinary data scientists at Johns Hopkins University, Morgan State University and beyond. DISCO will enable computational fluid dynamics studies of wind farms, ocean flow and physiological fluid dynamics. Research in multiscale modeling of materials will use machine learning to tailor material properties and integrate physical models at different scales to improve performance of additive manufacturing and connect defects and microstructures to macroscopic performance of crystals, polymers and other soft materials. DISCO will also enable sequencing of new genomes, study of variance within species and research on the microbiome. On larger scales, research on the dynamics of biological systems will examine function of proteins, membranes, cells and organs, including the impact of nanoparticles on function. This new integrated environment will reshape computational research practices and will be conducive to radical transformative research.

Secondly, the liquid CO2 transmission part extracts liquid CO2 from the storage tanks and increases the pressure until it satisfies the offshore pipeline transportation condition. The vapor-treatment part collects boil-off gas, generates vapor CO2, and charges the storage tanks with vapor CO2 to control the pressure of the storage tanks that discharge liquid CO2. Finally, the study results were compared with a liquefied natural gas (LNG) terminal. The biggest difference between the CO2 terminal in this study and the LNG terminal is that a vaporizer is essential in the CO2 terminal due to the smaller storage capacity of the CO2 terminal and, therefore, the lower amount of boil-off gas.",,,,,,,,,4,0,0,0,0,0,4,,,,1996-1073,,,,,,,,,,"Korea Res Inst Ships & Ocean Engn, Offshore Ind R&BD Ctr, Geoje 53201, South KoreaKorea Maritime & Ocean Univ, Ocean Sci & Technol Sch, Busan 49112, South KoreaKorea Res Inst Ships & Ocean Engn, Global Cooperat Ctr, Daejeon 34103, South Korea",,,,2020-01-07,WOS:000504898500128,,

Offshore oil and gas pipelines are being subjected to deeper water depths, more extreme environmental conditions, and harsher operating requirements than ever before. Given these conditions, free spanning pipelines are becoming more common and are often unavoidable during pipeline installation. Free spans occur as a result of irregular seafloor topography at installation or during pipeline operation as a result of vibration and scour. The pipeline with free span or regional and local scour will suffer fatigue damage due to oscillatory loads induced by vortex shedding. In this paper, a general solution of the vibration of a pipeline system with arbitrary type of discontinuity at arbitrary number of locations is presented. The pipeline on the seabed is simplified as a simply supported beam on elastic foundation. Two parameters are used to describe the scour or free span in the pipeline that are the central location of the scour or span and the width of the scour or span.

Giant oil fields are declining in their production worldwide and this situation is creating need for search of new conventional and non-conventional fossil reserves. With steep depletion of major onshore and shallow-water-offshore oil fields new search of fossil fuel is moving towards deep-water and ultra-deep water offshore fields. Obviously new reserves are located in extreme, hostile and hard-to-reach environmental conditions. Exploration, development and production of oil from such difficult offshore fields have many serious challenges to health, safety and environment (HSE) therefore, require sophisticated technological innovations to support increasing energy demand. Biggest oil spill accidents in explosion of Deepwater Horizon offshore oil platform are burning example of such challenges which human society cannot risk to repeat. Therefore, development of advance drilling system, more accurate and intelligent inspection mechanism, faster responsive system in cases of unfortunate incidence and efficient damage control system is need of the safer future. Successful implementation of robotics, in space and manufacturing industry, is an critical example of how robotic assistance and automation is the only option for safe and cost-effective production of oil in foreseeable future. Teleoperation of unmanned drilling and production platforms, remote operated vehicles (ROVs), autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs), under-water welding, welding robots for double hulled ships and under-water manipulator are such key robotic technologies which have facilitated smooth transition of offshore rigs from shallow waters to ultra-deep waters in modern time. Considering the sensitivity of product and difficulty of environment, most of these technologies fall under semi-autonomous category, where human operator is in loop for providing cognitive assistance to the overall operation for safe execution. This paper summarizes the key robotic technologies currently used in offshore oil and gas facilities. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Tubastraea micranthus, a congener, recently invaded the Gulf of Mexico and threatens to become another strong invasive due to similar growth and population expansion characteristics. It also appears to have strong competitive abilities. We examined active competition for space in both of these invasive species to determine their respective capabilities using three sessile Caribbean marine anthozoans - Ricordea florida (Cnidaria, Corallimorpharia), Epicystis crucifer, and Condylactis gigantea (Cnidaria, Actinaria). Coral polyps from the target coral species were placed in contact with the experimental competitor for 3-28 d. T. micranthus responded with an extracoelenteric digestion response to all three Caribbean competitors and was found to be competitively superior. The corallimorpharian R. florida and the anemone E. crucifer elicited extracoelenteric digestive responses from T. coccinea, while C gigantea did not. The two corals displayed no aggressive interactions towards each other, implying an immune recognition of each other as self. Both coral species exhibited aggressive behaviors towards and dominance over their competitors for space. These are characteristics which most likely facilitated the successful invasion of T. coccinea in the Western Atlantic. The scleractinian coral T. micranthus, exhibiting similar characteristics, also has the potential of becoming a successful invasive in the Atlantic. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

In the Rhuddanian age, the study area inherited and developed a semi-confinement stagnant basin resulting from tectonic compression started on Late Ordovician. The widely-covered organic-rich muddy shales occurred on deep-water shelves in a global-scale transgression after the Hirnantian glaciation and subsequent relatively slow regression. The sagged areas, formed mainly by tectonic tilting and plugging effect of rigid continental nucleus, are sedimentary centers of favorable source rocks. At the intermittent stage of tectonic compression during the Aeronian age, a mix-sedimented carbonate ramp formed by global sea-level drop, warm-humid climate and slight clastic sources. The reef-bank type carbonate reservoir rocks within Shiniulan Formation occurred in subtidal high-energy environments within inner ramp. In the subsequent Telychian stage, tectonic compression intensified, resulting in regression and overall uplifting of the basin, terminated the development of carbonate depositional environments. The eastern region was then dominated by shoreface and tide-dominated deltas where sand barrier type reservoir rocks in the Xiaoheba Formation occurred.

However, from 50 to 200 km offshore, upwelling trends are negative and interannual variability is 180 degrees out of phase with the nearshore signal.

Because coastal wetlands are especially effective in sequestering carbon, quantifying how disturbances may alter their ability to perform this climate-regulating function is important for assessing their carbon storage potential. Here, we quantified soil respiration, litter decomposition, and soil organic carbon (SOC), as a proxy for carbon storage, in areas disturbed by invasive feral hogs Sus scrofa and in adjacent, undisturbed areas within 3 southeastern US salt marshes. Contrary to our hypothesis that hog overturning of soils would stimulate soil respiration, this metric was lower and both surface and subsurface litter decomposition rates were similar in disturbed relative to undisturbed areas across all sites. SOC was lower in disturbed versus undisturbed areas at 2 sites as hypothesized, but higher at 1 site. Surveys and ana lyses reveal that lower and less variable infauna, plant, and benthic algae densities likely suppressed soil respiration in hog-disturbed versus undisturbed areas, while the offsetting effects of lower invertebrate densities and higher soil temperature likely caused decomposition to be consistent within and outside of disturbed areas. Conversely, between-site variation in disturbance intensity, plant canopy structure, and burrowing crab densities mediated the SOC response. These findings suggest that hog removal of plants and disruption of soils can cause tracts of marsh to transition from carbon sinks to sources where these disturbances are intense enough to prohibit rapid plant recovery and promote the gradual respiration of carbon stocks from denuded soils.",,,,,,,,,14,0,0,0,9,0,16,,,0171-8630,1616-1599,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Florida, Sch Nat Resources & Environm, Gainesville, FL 32611 USAUniv Florida, Engn Sch Sustainable Infrastruct & Environm, Dept Environm Engn Sci, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA",,,,2018-01-12,WOS:000419091500004,,

In this study, we use 18 Pb-210-dated sediment cores to determine the organic carbon (OC) accumulation rates from two hydrologically restored freshwater coastal acid sulfate soil (CASS) wetlands. Recent OC accumulation rates (from similar to 1980 to present) were estimated to be 251 +/- 26 g.m(-2).year(-1) in the seasonally inundated CASS and 227 +/- 50 g.m(-2).year(-1) in the permanently inundated CASS. The average OC accumulation during the previous century (190 +/- 20 g.m(-2).year(-1)) was within the range of blue carbon ecosystems (saltmarshes, mangroves, and seagrasses). Considering their large area and carbon accumulation rate, we estimate that Australian CASS wetlands sequester approximately 7.8 +/- 0.8 Tg of carbon annually, which is equivalent to similar to 8% of the CO2 emission from fossil fuels in Australia. Hence, preserving or restoring CASS may be a good climate change mitigation strategy.Plain Language Summary Coastal freshwater wetlands are highly productive and can sequester large amounts of carbon. The carbon accumulation rates here suggest that coastal acid sulfate soils (CASS) are also a substantial sink of CO2. By extrapolating our observations, we show that approximately 7.79 Tg of carbon is sequestered in Australian CASS wetlands annually which is equivalent to similar to 8% of the CO2 emission from fossil fuels in Australia. Hence, managing CASS wetlands to protect their soil carbon store function may help offset anthropogenic sources of greenhouse gasses and their hydrological remediation could be an important component to the global carbon cycle.",,,,,,,,,10,0,0,0,8,0,10,,,0094-8276,1944-8007,,,,,,,,,,"Southern Cross Univ, Natl Marine Sci Ctr, Coffs Harbour, NSW, AustraliaSouthern Cross Univ, Southern Cross Geosci, Lismore, NSW, Australia",,,,2019-05-01,WOS:000464650400026,,

Elevated levels of carcinogenic polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) were abundant in the upper water column throughout the event. Previous research suggests that PAHs may have negatively affected fishes in the northern GoM. Our objective was to test whether crude oil contamination from the DWH oil spill was correlated with changes in growth rates in adult Red Snapper, Lutjanus campechanus. We fit von Bertalanffy growth curves and back-calculated length-at-age using data collected from 2011-2013 during long-line surveys in the northern GoM and on the West Florida Shelf. No significant variation in von Bertalanffy growth parameters existed among the catch years; a combined-years model gave L-infinity, k, and t(0) values of 82.91, 0.20, and 0.43, respectively. No significant difference existed between pre- (back-calculated) and post-DWH growth curves. However, annual widths of the fourth, fifth, and sixth increments (the dominant cohorts in the population) declined significantly post-DWH (2010-2012) by 13%, 15%, and 22%, respectively, and were significantly smaller than the mean width of each respective increment in pre-spill years (2006-2009). While the DWH event was related temporally to growth declines in the dominant adult age groups, other environmental factors (winds, temperature, and river discharge) may also affect growth. Accordingly, meridional (V) and zonal (U) winds, sea level height anomalies (a proxy for water temperature variation), and Mississippi River discharge were compared to increment widths but none of the factors were strongly correlated with variation in age-specific growth increments (maximum Pearson's r= 0.47). Therefore, we are unable to reject the hypothesis that the DWH resulted in growth rate declines as opposed to climatic variation. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

The invasion of non-native plants is a major cause of land cover change, of biodiversity loss, and of other changes in ecosystem structure and function. In California, annual grasses from Mediterranean Europe have nearly displaced native perennial grasses across the coastal hillsides and terraces of the state. Our study examines the impact of this invasion on carbon cycling and storage at two sites in northern coastal California. The results suggest that annual grass invasion has caused an average drop in soil carbon storage of 40 Mg/ha in the top half meter of soil, although additional mechanisms may also contribute to soil carbon losses. We attribute the reduction in soil carbon storage to low rates of net primary production in non-native annuals relative to perennial grasses, a shift in rooting depth and water use to primarily shallow sources, and soil respiratory losses in non-native grass soils that exceed production rates. These results indicate that even seemingly subtle land cover changes can significantly impact ecosystem functions in general, and carbon storage in particular.",,,,,,,,,47,2,0,0,38,0,64,,,1748-9326,,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Calif Berkeley, Energy & Resources Grp, Berkeley, CA 94720 USAUniv Calif Berkeley, Dept Environm Sci Policy & Management, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA",,,,2011-10-01,WOS:000298674700006,,

PCS of Spartina marsh was 16.9 and 1.4 times higher compared to those of Suaeda and Phragmites marshes, whereas relatively larger aboveground PCS but smaller belowground PCS were found in the newly settled seaward margin of the Spartina marsh. SCS in Spartina marsh was also 1.5 times higher than that in unvegetated mudflat. Although Spartina vegetation assimilated a substantial amount of CO2, mass emission of CH4 from the invaded marsh was also noticed, especially in summer, it was 9-16 times higher than those from native marshes.

Possible explanations include ongoing mineralization of older OC or the influence of an unaccounted-for artifact of the methods used to measure burial rates. Alternatively, the trend may represent real acceleration in OC burial. We quantified OC burial rates of mangrove and coastal freshwater marshes in southwest Florida through a comparison of rates derived from Pb-210, Cs-137, and surface marker horizons. Age/depth profiles of lignin: OC were used to assess whether down-core remineralization had depleted the OC pool relative to lignin, and lignin phenols were used to quantify the variability of lignin degradation. Over the past 120 years, OC burial rates at seven sites increased by factors ranging from 1.4 to 6.2. We propose that these increases represent net acceleration. Change in relative sea-level rise is the most likely large-scale driver of acceleration, and sediment deposition from large storms can contribute to periodic increases. Mangrove sites had higher OC and lignin burial rates than marsh sites, indicating inherent differences in OC burial factors between the two habitat types. The higher OC burial rates in mangrove soils mean that their encroachment into coastal freshwater marshes has the potential to increase burial rates in those locations even more than might be expected from the acceleration trends. Regionally, these findings suggest that burial represents a substantially growing proportion of the coastal wetland carbon budget.Plain Language Summary Coastal mangroves and marshes use photosynthesis to change carbon dioxide into plant material like leaves, wood, and roots. As these materials die over time, they do not decompose the same way they might in a dry soil environment. Instead, daily ocean tides flood the soil, removing the oxygen and allowing dead plant materials to be buried and preserved for hundreds to thousands of years or more. This carbon burial process is a global benefit because it means that carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas, is stored belowground where it can no longer warm the atmosphere. Mangroves and marshes bury carbon more quickly than most other ecosystems, but little is known about how burial rates change over time. In this study, we quantify how rates of carbon burial have changed in southwest Florida coastal wetlands in the past century. We find that carbon burial is 2.5-4.5 times greater today than it was a century ago in mangroves and 1.9-2.3 times greater in marshes.

However, disturbances such as deforestation and forest degradation threaten the maintenance of these ecosystem services. This study aimed to understand how different disturbance histories affect the forest stand biomass, as well as species and functional diversity, and to what extent these differences can change the relationships between biomass and their drivers. We used data from forests with clear-cut and selectively logged disturbance histories, and from old-growth forests, situated in the Brazilian Atlantic forest. Forests with logging disturbances showed significant losses in their aboveground biomass compared to those of old-growth forests (50% loss in selectively logged forests and 80% loss in clear-cut forests). Interestingly, only clear-cut secondary forests showed differences in species and functional diversity, and were dominated by species with acquisitive trait values, commonly found early in succession. Shifts in stand biomass drivers were observed in selectively logged forests. The mass-ratio hypothesis (mainly through the functional trait of maximum height) was the most important biomass driver in clear-cut secondary and old-growth forests, whereas the importance of the niche complementarity hypothesis (through functional richness and dispersion) was higher in selectively logged forests. Our study highlights that disturbance histories can affect forest aboveground biomass and its drivers. Moreover, our results reinforce the need for conservation of intact forests but highlight the importance of including degraded forests in conservation mechanisms based in carbon stocks, as these forests retain high values of species and functional diversities that are crucial to biomass and consequently carbon stock acquisition.",,,,,,,,,31,4,0,0,26,2,34,,,0960-3115,1572-9710,,,,,,,,,,"Fed Univ Lavras UFLA, Sect Ecol & Conservat, Biol Inst, Av Doutor Sylvio Menicucci 100, BR-3720000 Lavras, MG, BrazilUniv Fed Vicosa, Biol Inst, LEEP, Ave Peter Henry Rolfs S-N,Campus Univ, BR-36570900 Vicosa, MG, BrazilUniv Fed Uberlandia, Biol Inst, Ceara St, BR-38400902 Uberlandia, MG, BrazilUniv Estadual Santa Cruz, Programa Posgrad Ecol & Conservacao Biodiversidad, Appl Conservat Ecol Lab, Ilheus, BA, BrazilState Univ Southwest Bahia, Dept Agr Engn & Soils, Estr Bem Querer,Km 4, BR-45083900 Vitoria Da Conquista, Brazil",State Univ Southwest Bahia,,,2018-10-01,WOS:000442731500011,,

Data were analysed for incidence of injury over time and relative risk using linear trend lines and regression.Results In total, 311 injuries for 1302 workers were analysed, 39% with rotation schedule of 4 weeks work and 4 weeks rest, 27% 8 weeks work and 4 weeks rest, 23% 16 weeks work and 4 weeks rest and 10% 24 weeks work and 4 weeks rest. Incidence of injury decreased as duration of time into the work rotation increased, corrected for exposure, and this was statistically significant for all rotations in first 4 weeks (P < 0.01). Negative correlation between time offshore and injury was observed in all schedules and consistent for age groups, categories of work, shifts and severity of injury. There was no difference in relative risk of injuries between the four schedules, when corrected for exposure and occupational risk of injury.Conclusions These results are at variance with previous studies, although no prior study has looked beyond 3-week rotation schedule.

Use of helicopters as a mode of logistics transport becomes ineffective when the distance is longer, the visibility is low, or the weather is stormy. Marine logistics support is more reliable and versatile. The present work focuses on developing a model for assessing risk associated with marine logistics operations in remote offshore locations (beyond helicopter reach) frequented with harsh environmental conditions (high winds, waves, and icy conditions). The key factors that affect such operations are identified and failure models are developed using fault trees. As an improvement, advance fault trees are adopted to relax the inherent limitations of the primary model. Uncertainties in both data and model are considered using the fuzzy inference system and evidence theory. Application of the proposed model is demonstrated through a case-study concerning a remote North Atlantic offshore operation.

The possibility of leaking from deep storage needs to be addressed. The Wadi Namaleh area in southern Jordan provides an interesting case study of how excess CO2 can be trapped in the form of carbonates in the near surface, even when the local geology is not obviously conducive for such a process.Carbonate veins are formed in surface alteration zones of rhyolite host rock in this arid region. The alteration zones are limited to areas where surface soil or colluvium are present. Oxygen, deuterium and carbon isotopes of the carbonates and near-surface ground water in the area suggest that the source of carbon is deep seated CO2, and that the carbonate precipitated in local meteoric water under ambient temperature conditions. Analysis of strontium in the carbonate, fresh rhyolite and altered host shows that the source for calcium is aeolian. Trace elements show that metal and REE mobility are constrained to the alteration zone.Thus, interaction of H2O, CO2 and atmospheric wet and dry deposition lead to the formation of the clayey (montmorillonite) alteration zone. This zone acts to trap seeping CO2 and water, and thus produces conditions of progressively more efficient trapping of carbon dioxide by means of a positive feedback mechanism. Replication of these conditions in other areas will minimize CO2 leakage from man-made CCS sites. (C) 2017 The Author.

The North Sea suffers pollution directly from some of these sources, but also indirectly from discharges from land, from rivers and from the atmosphere. The resilience of the North Sea ecosystem puts limits on the human use. These limits have in a number of cases been exceeded. It is necessary to define and assess the sustainable use of the North Sea ecosystem. The sustainable use may be defined as the long-term use of current and future potential while ensuring sustainable conservation of the ecological value of the North Sea and adjacent vulnerable water systems.

The purpose of this article is to introduce a decommissioning risk metric defined in terms of the ratio of the expected value of an asset's reserves to its expected cost of decommissioning. Asset decommissioning risk (ADR) is more difficult to compute than a consolidated corporate risk measure, but can be used to quantify the decommissioning risk of structures and to perform regional comparisons, and also provides market signals of future decommissioning activity. We formalize two risk metrics for decommissioning and apply the ADR metric to the deepwater Gulf of Mexico (GOM) floater inventory. Deepwater oil and gas structures are expensive to construct, and at the end of their useful life, will be expensive to decommission. The value of proved reserves for the 42 floating structures in the GOM circa January 2013 is estimated to range between $37 and $80 billion for future oil prices between 60 and 120 $/bbl, which is about 10 to 20 times greater than the estimated $4.3 billion to decommission the inventory.

First, annual energy yield production and electrical system losses for AC and DC offshore wind configurations are estimated by using Weibull probability distributions of wind speed. A cost model for calculating core energy economic metrics for offshore wind environment is developed by using a discount cash flow analysis. A case study is then conducted for a projected offshore wind farm (OWF) rated 100 MW and 300 MW sizes situated in the Aegean sea. Finally, a sensitivity analysis is performed for AC and DC OWFs with three different capacity factors (e.g., 45%, 55% and 60%) and various transmission line lengths ranging from 20 km to 120 km. The OWF is found to be economically viable for both AC and DC configurations with the estimated levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) ranging from 88.34 $/MWh to 113.76 $/MWh and from 97.61 $/MWh to 126.60 $/MWh, respectively. LCOEs for both options slightly change even though the wind farm size was increased three-fold. The sensitivity analysis reveals that, for further offshore locations with higher capacity factors, the superiority of AC configuration over the DC option in terms of LCOE reduces while the advantage of DC configuration over the AC option in terms of electrical losses is significant. Losses in the AC and DC configurations range from 3.75% to 5.86% and 3.75% to 5.34%, respectively, while LCOEs vary between 59.90 $/MWh and 113.76 $/MWh for the AC configuration and 66.21 $/MWh and 124.15 $/MWh for the DC configuration.

To identify the relevant methane evolution pathways in the northern Cascadia accretionary margin, a four-site transect was drilled during Integrated Ocean Drilling Program Expedition 311. The delta C-13 values of methane range from a minimum value of -82.2%. on an uplifted ridge of accreted sediment near the deformation front (Site U1326, 1829 mbsl, meters below sea level) to a maximum value of -39.5%. at the most landward location within an area of steep canyons near the shelf edge (Site U1329, 946 mbsl). An interpretation based solely on methane isotope values might conclude the C-13-enrichment of methane indicates a transition from microbially- to thermogenically-sourced methane. However, the co-existing CO2 exhibits a similar trend of C-13-enrichment along the transect with values ranging from -22.5 parts per thousand to +25.7 parts per thousand. The magnitude of the carbon isotope separation between methane and CO2 (epsilon(c) = 63.8 +/- 5.8) is consistent with isotope fractionation during microbially mediated carbonate reduction. These results, in conjunction with a transect-wide gaseous hydrocarbon content composed of > 99.8% (by volume) methane and uniform delta D-CH4 values (-172 parts per thousand +/- 8) that are distinct from thermogenic methane at a seep located 60 km from the Expedition 311 transect, suggest microbial CO2 reduction is the predominant methane source at all investigated sites. The magnitude of the intra-site downhole C-13-enrichment Of CO2 within the accreted ridge (Site U1326) and a slope basin nearest the deformation front (Site U1325, 2195 mbsl) is similar to 5 parts per thousand. At the mid-slope site (Site U1327, 1304 mbsl) the downhole C-13-enrichment of the CO2 is similar to 25 parts per thousand and increases to similar to 40 parts per thousand at the near-shelf edge Site U1329. This isotope fractionation pattern is indicative of more extensive diagenetic alteration at sites with greater C-13-enrichment. The magnitude of the C-13-enrichment Of CO2 correlates with decreasing sedimentation rates and a diminishing occurrence of stratigraphic gas hydrate. We suggest the decreasing sedimentation rates increase the exposure time of sedimentary organic matter to aerobic and anaerobic degradation, during burial, thereby reducing the availability of metabolizable organic matter available for methane production. This process is reflected in the occurrence and distribution of gas hydrate within the northern Cascadia margin accretionary prism. Our observations are relevant for evaluating methane production and the occurrence of stratigraphic gas hydrate within other convergent margins.

If not, what needs to be done? These are the questions that we aim to answer in this report. We first consider why these questions are important in the context of past, current and future pressures on the environment, and describe what ecological networks are and the benefits they bring. We go on to consider the strengths and weaknesses of our current wildlife sites, before setting out a prioritised set of ecological solutions to improve the network. Finally, we make 24 recommendations for practical action to Make Space for Nature and achieve a coherent and resilient ecological network. Throughout, we stress that what is needed is a step-change in nature conservation. We need to embrace a new, restorative approach which rebuilds nature and creates a more resilient natural environment for the benefit of wildlife and ourselves. This will require strong leadership from government, but is not a job for government alone. It will require effective and positive engagement with the landowners and land managers. And it will need improved collaboration between local authorities, local communities, statutory agencies, the voluntary and private sectors, farmers, other land-managers and individual citizens. Why is having a coherent and resilient ecological network important? England's wildlife and landscapes have inspired and delighted through generations. There are strong moral arguments for recognising the intrinsic values of other species and for passing on the natural riches we have inherited to future generations. We have also recently begun to better understand (or perhaps remember) that our natural world is not a luxury: it is fundamental to our well-being, health and economy. The natural environment provides us with a range of benefits [long dash] ecosystem services including food, water, materials, flood defences and carbon sequestration [long dash] and biodiversity underpins most, if not all, of them. The pressures on our land and water are likely to continue to increase and we need to learn how to manage these resources in ways which deliver multiple benefits, for example, achieving profitable and productive farming while also adopting practices which enhance carbon storage, improve flood water management and support wildlife. Declines in wildlife are a global problem: the World has failed to meet its commitment to achieve a significant reduction in the rate of global biodiversity loss by 2010; Europe has not met its 2010 target to halt biodiversity loss. The report summarises the losses that have occurred, and continue to occur, in England's wildlife. Across species groups we have seen significant declines, in particular since the end of the Second World War, mainly as a result of changes in land use which has led to the loss and deterioration of many wildlife habitats. But it is not all bad news: for some habitats and species the historic patterns of losses have slowed, and in some cases they have been reversed (often through the conservation efforts of statutory bodies, the voluntary sector and landowners). Nonetheless, across many groups of species it is the more 'specialist' species that tend to be in decline while the less choosy, more adaptable 'generalists' tend to be faring better - an indication of ongoing declines in the quality and variety of England's natural environment. Concern for nature is not new, and considerable progress has been made over the last century to protect wildlife. Voluntary conservation organisations helped to stimulate popular and Government support, culminating in the National Park and Access to the Countryside Act 1949 which laid the foundations for designating places that are special for wildlife (notably National Nature Reserves and Sites of Special Scientific Interest, SSSIs) and people (National Parks and Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty). Subsequent legislation has improved first the protection, and more recently the management, of wildlife sites in particular SSSIs. Despite the important contribution designated sites have made, England's wildlife habitats have become increasing fragmented and isolated, leading to declines in the provision of some ecosystem services, and losses to species populations. Ecological networks have become widely recognised as an effective response to conserve wildlife in environments that have become fragmented by human activities. An ecological network comprises a suite of high quality sites which collectively contain the diversity and area of habitat that are needed to support species and which have ecological connections between them that enable species, or at least their genes, to move. Over 250 ecological networks are being planned or implemented at international, national and regional levels around the world, including in some parts of the UK. Provision for ecological networks is made in a number of international treaties and agreements but England has not yet met its commitments under these agreements. Taking steps to do so, however, will deliver a range of benefits for people as well as wildlife, because of the range of ecosystem services that resilient, coherent ecological networks can provide. We propose that the overarching aim for England's ecological network should be to deliver a natural environment where: Compared to the situation in 2000, biodiversity is enhanced and the diversity, functioning and resilience of ecosystems re-established in a network of spaces for nature that can sustain these levels into the future, even given continuing environmental change and human pressures. We also recommend that this be underpinned by three objectives: (1) To restore species and habitats appropriate to England's physical and geographical context to levels that are sustainable in a changing climate, and enhanced in comparison with those in 2000. (2) To restore and secure the long-term sustainability of the ecological and physical processes that underpin the way ecosystems work, thereby enhancing the capacity of our natural environment to provide ecosystem services such as clean water, climate regulation and crop pollination, as well as providing habitats for wildlife. (3) To provide accessible natural environments rich in wildlife for people to enjoy and experience. Future Challenges Demographic change, economic growth, new technologies, societal preferences and changes in policy and regulatory environments (international, EU and domestic) may all have profound consequences - some potentially positive - for our ability to establish a coherent and resilient ecological network. Climate change, particularly in the longer term, may have the biggest impact of all. We are already seeing a number of changes as a result of climate: shifts in species ranges; changes in the timing of seasonal events (with emerging mismatches in the timing of events for currently inter-dependent species); and habitat preferences altering. Not all changes will be harmful, for example, many of England's southern species may be able to increase their range by expanding northwards. In the longer term, however, species may struggle to survive, and other impacts such as sea-level rise, an increase in extreme weather events, and other changes to ecosystem processes (e.g. caused by summer droughts) are likely to have further profound, and largely negative, effects. Establishing a coherent and resilient ecological network will help wildlife to cope with these changes. It will also improve the ability of our natural environment to provide a range of high quality ecosystem services today and in the future. It can help us both mitigate and adapt to climate change by, for example, storing carbon or improving the security of water supplies. We don't know exactly what the future holds, and we don't know exactly which species will be the winners and losers. Conserving the ecosystems and wildlife that we have today will, however, maximise our future options and improve our chances of achieving health and prosperity for ourselves and our children. The Nature and Status of our current Wildlife Sites and Ecological Network England has a wide range of different types of statutory and non-statutory sites which, to a greater or lesser extent, support our wildlife. We take a broad view of what comprises a 'wildlife site' and identify three general categories ('Tiers'), which include eleven types of sites. Tier 1 sites are those whose primary purpose is nature conservation and which have a high level of protection (e.g. SSSIs); Tier 2 sites are designated for their high biodiversity value but do not receive full protection (e.g. Local Wildlife Sites); Tier 3 are landscape designations with wildlife conservation as part of their statutory purpose (National Parks and AONBs). We examine the extent to which these different Tiers of sites separately and collectively comprise a coherent and resilient ecological network by testing the evidence against five attributes that we identify for such a network: (i) The network will support the full range of England's biodiversity and incorporate ecologically important areas, including special biodiversity. (ii) The network and its component sites will be of adequate size, taking account of the needs of our natural environment to adapt to climate change. (iii) The network sites will receive long-term protection and appropriate management. (iv) Sufficient ecological connections will exist between sites to enable species movement. (v) Sites will be valued by, and be accessible to people, including sites close to where they live. We draw upon a wide range of evidence including academic literature, organisational reports, evidence submitted to the panel by more than 45 organisations and novel analyses carried out specifically for this review. The evidence demonstrates that the SSSI series, as important as it is, clearly does not in itself comprise a coherent and resilient ecological network. Perhaps this should not come as a surprise since SSSIs were not designated with this aim in mind. Looking across all three Tiers of wildlife sites, the evidence demonstrates that only attribute (i) is substantially met; in all other cases there are serious short-comings in the network. Notably, many of England's wildlife sites are too small; losses of certain habitats have been so great that the area remaining is no longer enough to halt additional biodiversity losses without concerted efforts; with the exception of Natura 2000 sites and SSSIs, most of England's semi-natural habitats important for wildlife are generally insufficiently protected and under-managed; many of the natural connections in our countryside have been degraded or lost, leading to isolation of sites; and too few people have easy access to wildlife. Many species are now largely restricted to wildlife sites simply because they have mostly been lost from everywhere else. We need to take steps to rebuild nature. Rebuilding Nature The essence of what needs to be done to enhance the resilience and coherence of England's ecological network can be summarised in four words: more, bigger, better and joined. There are five key approaches which encompass these, and also take account of the land around the ecological network. We need to: (i) Improve the quality of current sites by better habitat management. (ii) Increase the size of current wildlife sites. (iii) Enhance connections between, or join up, sites, either through physical corridors, or through 'stepping stones'. (iv) Create new sites. (v) Reduce the pressures on wildlife by improving the wider environment, including through buffering wildlife sites. We set out an ecological rationale for deciding between these approaches. In general, the first priority is to enhance the quality of remaining wildlife habitat. Increasing connectivity helps, but first there needs to be high quality sites with thriving wildlife populations to connect. Local circumstances are also important. In areas which have large amounts of relatively unfragmented habitat, the best strategy will often be to focus on improving management and enhancing habitat diversity ('heterogeneity'). In contrast, in areas which only have small and isolated sites, it will be better to invest in the restoration and creation of new wildlife habitat. Importantly, there are trade-offs between these actions: the more we do to improve the quality of existing sites or to reduce the pressures on them by enhancing the wider environment, the less we will need to do to create new wildlife sites. Establishing a coherent and resilient ecological network The approaches required to achieve a coherent and resilient ecological network are varied, and we make 24 wide-ranging recommendations. Five themes unite them: (i) We need to continue the recent progress in improving the management and condition of wildlife sites, particularly our SSSIs. We also make recommendations for how these should be designated and managed in ways that enhance their resilience to climate change. (ii) We need to properly plan ecological networks, including restoration areas. Restoration needs to take place throughout England. However, in some areas, both the scale of what can be delivered to enhance the network, and the ensuing (iii) There are a large number of surviving patches of important wildlife habitat scattered across England outside of SSSIs, for example in Local Wildlife Sites. We need to take steps to improve the protection and management of these remaining wildlife habitats. 'Protection' will usually be best achieved through incentive-based mechanisms, but at times may require designation. (iv) We need to become better at deriving multiple benefits from the ways we use and interact with our environment. There are many things that society has to do that may seem to have rather little to do with nature conservation, but could have, or even should have if we embrace more radical thinking; flood management by creating wetlands is an obvious example. We need to exploit these 'win-win' opportunities to the full. Being better at valuing a wider range of ecosystem services would help this process. (v) We will not achieve a step-change in nature conservation in England without society accepting it to be necessary, desirable, and achievable. This will require strong leadership from government and significant improvements in collaboration between local authorities, local communities, statutory agencies, the voluntary and private sectors, farmers, landowners and other land-managers and individual citizens Our recommendations set out a 'direction of travel'. They do not provide a detailed, prescriptive plan of exactly what should happen, where. The precise solutions need to take full account of local opportunities and ambition, although we believe that some form of national framework is required to ensure coherence and cost-efficiencies across the network (what happens in one place will affect what is needed elsewhere). Partly because we have not set out a detailed, prescriptive plan, and partly because many of the recommendations overlap and interact (i.e. what we have to do to implement one recommendation will often depend upon how successful we are in implementing others), it has not been possible to provide accurate estimates of the cost of each of the 24 recommendations. Nonetheless, taking account of recent comprehensive biodiversity cost- estimates derived by other studies, and including current expenditure, we estimate that the total annual costs of establishing a coherent and resilient network will be in the range of [Pound]600 million to [Pound]1.1 billion. The next few years are clearly going to be a time of budgetary constraint, when additional resources are unlikely to be available. We recognise that it will not be possible to take all necessary action immediately, or even soon. We do, however, need to plan for the medium and longer term and Make Space for Nature. Amongst this uncertainty, there is one thing of which we can be certain: the sooner we act to establish a coherent and resilient ecological network, the lower the eventual cost and the greater the benefits for us all.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2011-03-23,ZOOREC:ZOOR14704033433,,

To begin with, there is little research that categorizes the typologies of regulatory capture despite the ubiquity of the phenomenon. After a discussion of theoretical approaches to regulatory capture, I describe the operative definition and theory appropriate to the situation related to authorization of oil and natural gas production in Israel following the discovery of large offshore reserves in 2010. This approach, embodying several facets of existing typologies, is applied to decisions made authorizing construction of the Gabriella offshore exploratory drilling platform. The analysis highlights the nature of capture in the absence of clear agency jurisdiction over new activities located in offshore environs organized as temporal and spatial vacuums. I conclude that comprehensive marine spatial planning would result in less capture and the development of more capture-resistant regulations. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

We have undertaken detailed oceanographic and environmental surveys to optimize in-stream turbine power generation and to quantify potential environmental effects. In 2011 and 2012, tidal turbine,demonstration projects were conducted in Muskeget Channel to determine the combined effects of blade strikes, shear stress, turbulence, and cavitation on zooplankton. Single turbines may minimally impact zooplankton populations; howeever, full-scale projects may potentially alter zooplankton populations forming the base of coastal food webs. Static plankton tows were performed up-and downstream of the operating turbine axis. Integral flow meters allowed adjustment of tow duration to optimize zooplankton density in the concentrate. Samples were held at in situ temperatures, and sequestial photomicrographs and video images were taken to determine particle density, size distribution, and the number of live organisms in samples taken up and down gradient of the operating tidal turbines within 3 h of collection, Statistical analysis showed no significant difference in the total number or size distribution of motile zooplankters, indicating tidal turbine operation did not cause significant mortality and suggested that impacts of commercial size tidal energy projects upon zooplankton populations in Muskeget Channel may be negligible.",,,,,,,,,6,0,0,0,1,0,6,,,0025-3324,1948-1209,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Massachusetts, Sch Marine Sci & Technol, Coastal Syst Program, Amherst, MA 01003 USAWoods Hole Oceanog Inst, Woods Hole, MA USA",,,,2013-11-07,WOS:000324844400015,,

The test is performed in the range of pH values of 0-14 using deionised water and seawater as leaching solutions. The experimental conditions mimic different circumstances of the marine environment due to the global acidification, carbon dioxide (CO2) leakages from carbon capture and sequestration technologies, and accidental chemical spills in seawater. Leaching test results using seawater as leaching solution show a better neutralisation capacity giving slightly lower metal leaching concentrations than when using deionised water. The contaminated sediment shows a low base-neutralisation capacity (BNCpH 12 = -0.44 eq/kg for deionised water and BNCpH 12 = -1.38 eq/kg for seawater) but a high acid-neutralisation capacity when using deionised water (ANC(pH 4) = 3.58 eq/kg) and seawater (ANC(pH 4) = 3.97 eq/kg). Experimental results are modelled with the Visual MINTEQ geochemical software to predict metal release from sediment using both leaching liquids. Surface adsorption to iron- and aluminium-(hydr)oxides was applied for all studied elements. The consideration of the metal-organic matter binding through the NICA-Donnan model and Stockholm Humic Model for lead and copper, respectively, improves the former metal release prediction.

The GreenTuff formation is associated with the opening of the Japan Sea, which occurred in the Early Miocene and was accompanied by large-scale volcanic activities. We measured halogen concentrations and I-129?/I ratios in oil and gas field brines and hot springs in order to determine the origin of iodine and. indirectly, of hydrocarbons in this area and their association with geological processes during the formation of the Japanese Island Arc. Based on the concentration of iodine, these samples fall into three categories: Type A (I > 190 mu M), Type B (150 mu M>I>90 mu M), and Type C (I<50 mu M). Samples in Types A and B come predominantly from oil/gas fields and have I-129/I ratios below 300 x 10(-15), corresponding to ages essentially in the Eocene epoch. In contrast, samples in Type C are generally from hot springs and have I-129/I ratios above 400 x 10(-15), corresponding to Oligocene to Miocene ages. Source formations for Type C were accumulated during the active opening of the Japan Sea, however, those for Types A and B probably are organic-rich Eocene sediments or older basement rocks which predate the volcanic formations associated with the backarc spreading of the Japanese Island. The observation that oil and gas is predominantly found in reservoir formations of middle to late Miocene age suggests mobilization of these brines in association with the tectonic and volcanic/hydrothermal activities during the opening of the Japan Sea which also led to the formation of the Kuroko Deposits in the same area. The hot spring samples of Type C reflect these processes most directly. Because of the close association of iodine with methane and other hydrocarbons, oil and gas in the Green Tuff area probably is also derived from sources considerably older than the current reservoir formations.

The vortex-induced vibration (VIV) of marine risers constitutes an important problem in deep water oil exploration and production. VIV will result in high rates of structural failure of marine riser due to fatigue damage accumulation and diminishes the riser fatigue life. In-service monitoring or full scale testing is essential to improve our understanding of VIV response and enhance our ability to predict fatigue damage. One marine riser fatigue acoustic telemetry scheme is proposed and an engineering prototype machine has been developed to monitor deep and ultra-deep water risers' fatigue and failure that can diminish the riser fatigue life and lead to economic losses and eco-catastrophe. Many breakthroughs and innovation have been achieved in the process of developing an engineering prototype machine. Sea trials were done on the 6th generation deep-water drilling platform HYSY-981 in the South China Sea. The inclination monitoring results show that the marine riser fatigue acoustic telemetry scheme is feasible and reliable and the engineering prototype machine meets the design criterion and can match the requirements of deep and ultra-deep water riser fatigue monitoring.

Most of these maps rely on estimates of ecosystem services estimated for individual land cover classes rather than incorporating field data. We developed combined field models (CFM) using regression analysis to estimate ecosystem services based on the observed relationship between environmental and land cover data and field measurements of ecosystem services. Local ecosystem service supply was estimated from vegetation data measured at fifty sites covering the widest range of environmental conditions across a watershed in Mexico. We compared the accuracy of the CFM approach for forage, timber, firewood and carbon storage over a more commonly look up table method relying on a uniform estimate of ecosystem service supply by land cover type. The CFM revealed higher accuracy when compared to the look up table approach. The resulting CFM models explained a large fraction of the variance (42-89%) using a combination of land cover, remote sensing data, hydrology and distance from developed areas. In addition, mapping residuals from Geographically Weighted Regressions provided an estimate of uncertainty across the CFM model results. This approach provides better estimates of ecosystem service delivery and uncertainty for land managers and decision-makers. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

In the context of a spill event, the biodegradation of crude oil and gas condensate off eastern Canada is an essential component of a response strategy. In laboratory experiments, we simulated conditions similar to an oil spill with and without the addition of chemical dispersant under both winter and summer conditions and evaluated the natural attenuation potential for hydrocarbons in near-surface sea water from the vicinity of crude oil and natural gas production facilities off eastern Canada. Chemical analyses were performed to determine hydrocarbon degradation rates, and metagenome binning combined with metatranscriptomics was used to reconstruct abundant bacterial genomes and estimate their oil degradation gene abundance and activity. Our results show important and rapid structural shifts in microbial populations in all three different oil production sites examined following exposure to oil, oil with dispersant and dispersant alone. We found that the addition of dispersant to crude oil enhanced oil degradation rates and favored the abundance and expression of oil-degrading genes from a Thalassolituus sp.

To capture complexities of vertical accretion across the marsh platform, we employed a novel approach that incorporates spatially variable suspended sediment concentrations and biomass of multiple plant species as functions of elevation and distance from sediment sources. The model predicts a stable areal extent of Plum Island marshes for a variety of SLR scenarios through 2100, where limited marsh drowning is compensated by limited marsh migration into adjacent uplands. Nevertheless, the model predicts widespread conversion of high marsh vegetation to low marsh vegetation, and accretion deficits that indicate eventual marsh drowning.

Specifically, the study explores the implied power relations between government, industry, New Zealand's Indigenous tribes (hereafter, iwi), communities, and other stakeholders. We find that industry and central government dominate SLO-related public discourse, and they frequently vest SLO agency with industry rather than community groups, iwi, or the wider public. Indeed, iwi are largely absent from the SLO discourse in public documents. Definitions of SLO vary extensively across the documents and are largely captured by industry and central government.

J,,,,,,,,,Martin Palmer,,The role of marine diagenesis of tephra in the carbon cycle,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Awarded Grant,Mar 01 2013,2013,"Every year volcanoes eject approximately 1 billion tonnes of ash into the atmosphere. Because most volcanoes are found around the edges of continents and on islands, most of this material ends up in the oceans. As a result, it is estimated that around a quarter of all the sediment in the Pacific is derived from the products of explosive volcanoes that surround this ocean, but very little is known about what happens to this material after it falls to the seafloor. Volcanic ash (or tephra) is not an inert material. It has a very high ratio of surface area to volume and the chemical composition of the tephra is such that it starts to undergo extensive reaction with seawater as soon as it enters the oceans. For example, in a study of the seafloor around the volcanic island of Montserrat we found that where layers of tephra accumulate on the seafloor they completely deplete the sediment pore water of dissolved oxygen within a few millimetres of the sediment-water interface as a result of oxidation of iron bound to the surface of the volcanic particles. This rapid oxygen depletion in sediments is very unusual as it is normally only observed where there are very high concentrations of organic matter in the sediments, for example in the shallow waters in estuaries and on the continental shelf. One of the consequences of this behaviour when tephra accumulates in the oceans is that it helps to preserve high concentrations of organic carbon in marine sediments that would otherwise be oxidised to carbon dioxide. This is important, because the return of this source of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere helps to regulate the Earth's climate, and there is evidence that massive volcanic eruptions in the Earth's distant past have been linked to the initiation of intense glaciations. While we can make some estimates of the global impact of this process on the seawater chemistry from studies of the sediments around a single volcano (such as we done in the Caribbean), it is likely that different types of volcanic material erupted into different parts of the oceans (e.g. cold high latitude seas versus warm tropical seas) will have different effects. Hence, we plan to study a range of different types of tephra that have been erupted into several areas of the oceans.As most oil and gas deposits are ultimately derived from the preservation of organic carbon in marine sediments, it is possible that our studies will also aid oil companies with new exploration targets for the future. In addition, there have been several studies of how we might carry out geoengineering to mitigate the increase in carbon dioxide concentrations in the atmosphere. Many of these solutions involve considerable expense at potential harm to the environment, it is possible that the sequestering or carbon by spreading tephra (an abundant, cheap, renewable and naturally occurring material) on areas of the seafloor may be one of the least damaging and expensive alternatives.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,NE/K00543X/1,,,,,,,,University of Southampton,,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:15380368,,

However, the magnitude of projected twenty-first century acidification differs strongly across Earth system models(8). Here we identify an emergent multi-model relationship between the simulated present-day density of Arctic Ocean surface waters, used as a proxy for Arctic deep-water formation, and projections of the anthropogenic carbon inventory and coincident acidification. By applying observations of sea surface density, we constrain the end of twenty-first century Arctic Ocean anthropogenic carbon inventory to 9.0 +/- 1.6 petagrams of carbon and the basin-averaged Omega(arag) and Omega(calc) to 0.76 +/- 0.06 and 1.19 +/- 0.09, respectively, under the high-emissions Representative Concentration Pathway 8.5 climate scenario. Our results indicate greater regional anthropogenic carbon storage and ocean acidification than previously projected3,8 and increase the probability that large parts of the mesopelagic Arctic Ocean will be undersaturated with respect to calcite by the end of the century.

Hence an oil spill may potentially hit a larger fraction of a year-class of offspring. Such a link between demographic structure and egg distribution was recently demonstrated for the Northeast Arctic stock of Atlantic cod for years 1959-1993.

Key geological storage properties (pressure, temperature, depth and permeability) can affect injectivity and lead to variations in CO2 flow, which feed back into the pipeline transportation system. In previous storage models, the interface between the reservoir performance and the transportation infrastructure is unclear and the models are unable to provide details for flow and pressure management within a transportation network in response to changes in the operation of storage sites. Variation in storage demand due to daily and seasonal variations of fossil fuels uses and by extension CO2 flow is also likely to influence transportation infrastructure availability and the capacity to deliver. This work evaluates, at the level of infrastructure planning, the impact of geological uncertainty on CCS pipeline transportation and injection infrastructure. The analysis presented shows how to consider uncertainty in store properties in combination with CO2 flow variability to estimate the likely impact on pipeline infrastructure design. The operational envelope of the storage site infrastructure is estimated by combining the Darcy flow analysis of simple reservoir models with rigorous process simulation of the storage site wells. The proximity of wellhead conditions to the CO2 equilibrium line and the maximum velocities inside the well constrain the operational envelope of the storage site and limit the ability of the storage site infrastructure to handle CO2 flow variation. These factors, which are significantly influenced by variations in subsurface conditions, have also an impact on the design of the offshore pipeline infrastructure, needing to accommodate changes in pressure delivery requirements. Based on the evaluation of examples developed for different offshore transportation scenarios relevant to the United Kingdom, detailed insight on the expected impacts of store properties on pipeline transportation infrastructure design and operation is provided. For instance, it is found that enabling storage site flexibility is simpler in stores with an initial pressure above 20 MPa. Given reductions in reservoir permeability, the requirements for pressure delivery are strongly dependent on the store temperature. Although the analysis is performed for specific geological characteristics in the North Sea the evaluation methodology is transferable to other locations and can be used for site screening to identify sites which are more flexible in terms of uncertainty in store performance.

Yet many of their inhabitants are becoming increasingly vulnerable to flooding and conversions of their land to open ocean.

Here we present an assessment of 33 deltas chosen to represent the world's deltas.

Those modelling studies that incorporate varying degrees of geological realism show the inherent risks and uncertainties that can result from neglecting heterogeneity and reservoir-caprock topography along the migration path of an injected CO2 plume. A key problem is that detailed geological data are often not available for the relatively deep saline aquifers that are an important target for CCS. Deep saline aquifers fall between the relatively data-rich environments of shallow freshwater aquifers and hydrocarbon reservoirs and it is in these settings that outcrop analogues may play an important part in reducing the risks and uncertainties associated with CCS. This study uses an example from the Sherwood Sandstone Group (Otter Sandstone Formation) of the Wessex Basin to show how an outcrop study can impart a much greater understanding of heterogeneity in critical reservoir-caprock zones. Here the transition from the Sherwood Sandstone Group (fluvial sandstone reservoir) to the Mercia Mudstone Group (playa lacustrine mudstone seal) is not simple, but includes a major change in fluvial style that introduces considerable heterogeneity at the top of the reservoir. The study shows how laser-scanned outcrop can be used to rapidly construct static geological models that are taken through to flow simulations. In combination, the use of appropriate outcrop analogues and flow modelling can reduce the risks and uncertainties associated with CCS.",,,,,,,,,10,1,0,0,0,0,10,,,0305-8719,,978-1-78620-140-9,,,,,,,,,"British Geol Survey, Maclean Bldg, Wallingford OX10 8BB, Oxon, EnglandCoventry Univ, Priory St, Coventry CV1 5FB, W Midlands, England",,,,2016-12-07,WOS:000388097100012,,

Without any rain, to capture CO2 produced from gasoline requires adding about $1 to the per-gallon pump-price to cover irrigation costs, using reverse osmosis (RO), desalinated, sea water. Such mature technology is economically competitive with the currently favored, untested, power-plant Carbon Capture (and deep underground, or under-ocean) Sequestration (CCS). Afforestation sequesters CO2, mostly as easily stored wood, both from distributed sources (automotive, aviation, etc., that CCS cannot address) and from power plants. Climatological feasibility and sustainability of such irrigated forests, and their potential global impacts are explored using a general circulation model (GCM). Biogeophysical feedback is shown to stimulate considerable rainfall over these forests, reducing desalination and irrigation costs; economic value of marketed, renewable, forest biomass, further reduces costs; and separately, energy conservation also reduces the size of the required forests and therefore their total capital and operating costs. The few negative climate impacts outside of the forests are discussed, with caveats.

These propulsion systems are typically non-linear in nature with very high harmonic injection, which can have a significant impact on vessel wide systems and sub-systems. AC Adjustable Speed Drive (ASD) propulsion systems characteristically inject current harmonics into the generator system impedance creating voltage distortion. DC ASDs produce even higher voltage distortion levels due to voltage notching caused by the thyristor firing which makes their harmonic mitigation requirement much more challenging.

The U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) intends to enhance and sustain its training and testing assets and also optimize its stewardship of natural resources through the development and application of an ecosystem-based management approach on DoD installations. To accomplish this goal, particularly for installations in estuarine/coastal environments, the Strategic Environmental Research and Development Program (SERDP) launched the Defense Coastal/Estuarine Research Program (DCERP) as a 10-year effort at Marine Corps Base Camp Lejeune (MCBCL) in North Carolina. The results of the second 5 years of the program (DCERP2) are presented in the DCERP2 Final Report.There were four overarching objectives of DCERP2. The first objective was to understand the effects of climate change impacts, including warming temperatures, variability in the hydrological cycle, storm events, and sea level rise on the coastal ecosystems at MCBCL from observations and measurements made over the 10-year program. The second objective was to understand the carbon cycle of the coastal and terrestrial ecosystems at MCBCL through a highly integrated sampling program. The third objective was to develop models, tools, and indicators to evaluate current and projected future ecosystem state changes and translate scientific findings into actionable information for installation managers. The last objective was to recommend adaptive management strategies to sustain ecosystem natural resources within the context of an active military installation.The research effort described in this report is an attempt to quantify burial rates and standing stocks of carbon in several natural and created (aged 3 to 28 years) marshes in Northwest Florida from eastern Choctawhatchee Bay to Pensacola Bay. The goal of this work was to provide data that are useful in determining the carbon sequestration value of the sites in question and to contribute to a broader understanding of the geographical variability of carbon storage rates in both natural and created marshes.

Breeding was first reported by naturalists at Painted Cave (1912), Scorpion Rocks (1928), and Orizaba Rock (1937). During early seabird colony surveys of the Channel Islands, breeding was also noted at Cavern Point Cove Caves (1970), Diablo Rocks (1976), and Gull Island (1977). During 1991-1998, more extensive surveys of nearly all sea caves and offshore rocks documented additional breeding at Bat Cave, Cave of the Birds' Eggs, Del Mar Cove Cave, Del Mar Rock, Dry Sandy Beach Cave, Shipwreck Cave, and Willows Anchorage Rocks. Historical impacts apparently occurred from specimen collecting and interference by other nesting seabirds; however, guano harvesting may have had major impacts on nesting habitats at Scorpion Rocks (main rock) and Orizaba Rock. Impacts from organochlorine pollutants were likely extensive, and population sizes at all colonies may have been lower in the 1960s and 1970s when organochlorine pollution was at its highest level. Standardized monthly nest monitoring during 1995-1998 was used to measure reproductive success and population size at 5 colonies, creating a baseline for long-term trend monitoring that has continued annually to 2016. Mist net captures were used to estimate population sizes at 2 colonies in 1991. Estimated population size for Santa Cruz Island in 1991-1998 was 338 pairs, greater than previously reported for 1976-1977 (45-55 pairs), but the more recent estimate includes more colonies (especially 3 large colonies in sea caves), different methods of estimation, and likely some recovery from impacts associated with organochlorine pollution.",,,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,,,1527-0904,1944-8341,,,,,,,,,,"Humboldt State Univ, Dept Wildlife, 1 Harpst St, Arcata, CA 95521 USACarter Biol Consulting, 1015 Hampshire Rd, Victoria, BC V8S 4S8, CanadaUS Fish & Wildlife Serv, Arcata Fish & Wildlife Off, 1655 Heindon Rd, Arcata, CA 95521 USAUS Fish & Wildlife Serv, San Francisco Bay Natl Wildlife Refuge Complex, 1 Marshlands Rd, Fremont, CA 94555 USACalif Inst Environm Studies, 3408 Whaler Ave, Davis, CA 95616 USA45 Parkside Dr, Davis, CA 95616 USA",Carter Biol ConsultingCalif Inst Environm Studies,,,2019-01-07,WOS:000454175400009,,

At each station occupied hydrocarbon concentrations were logged continuously from a towed in situ fluorimeter attached to a MIKT net used to sample larvae and deployed on an oblique tow from surface to bottom. The results show a distinct north-south gradient in hydrocarbon concentration peaking around installations associated with oil and gas exploration and production. Depth averaged data show that the mean concentration in the top 50 m was between 3 and 4 mu g l(-1) at latitudes between 56.00 and 59.00 degrees N falling to values as low as 0.2-0.5 mu g l(-1) in the more pristine waters to the north and west. The hydrocarbon levels in the top 50 m between 56.00 and 59.00 degrees N were elevated compared to those in deeper water. 7-Ethoxyresorufin 0-deethylase (EROD) activity was measured in pooled samples of both sandeel and gadoid larvae. For both species the range of EROD activities was large and variable and this is probably due to damage to larvae associated with capture and subsequent denaturation of the enzyme. Despite this the results show elevated EROD activity in samples taken on the southern end of the transect where hydrocarbon fluorescence in the water was highest and there is a significant regression of EROD activity on hydrocarbon concentration. The results therefore suggest a significant elevation of hydrocarbons in a large area of the northern North Sea (5-10 times the true background) and that these concentrations are capable of inducing biological responses associated with deleterious effects in fish larvae.,,,,,,,,,23,0,0,0,12,0,24,,,0048-9697,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1996-07-30,WOS:A1996UU39600002,,

This stage is often referred to as valley of death' where device developers face the challenge of raising capital needed to demonstrate the prototype. The dilemma is that investors understandably demand a proven track record and demonstrated reliability in order to provide capital. One way to resolve this dilemma is specific component reliability testing that not only satisfies investor expectations but holds the potential to improve and de-risk components for MRE. This paper gives an overview to different component reliability test approaches in established industries and for MRE, covering both wave and tidal energy technologies. There has been notable activity in the research community to develop and implement dedicated component reliability test rigs that allow the investigation and demonstration of component reliability under controlled, yet representative conditions. Two case studies of physical test rigs will illustrate the possible test approaches. The Nautilus Powertrain test rig, a facility at the Offshore Renewable Energy (ORE) Catapult, focuses on the demonstration and testing of drive train components including gearboxes, generators, mechanical couplings and bearings. The Dynamic Marine Component test rig (DMaC) at the University of Exeter aims to replicate the forces and motions for floating offshore applications and their subsystems, including mooring lines and power cables.

Due to the global warming, physical changes are ongoing in the Arctic and human activity is increasing there. The prospect of new shipping routes, expanded oil and gas development, and new commercial fishing might generate environmental impacts in the Arctic. Therefore there is a need to restrict and regulate navigations in the Arctic. But there must be international regulatory uniformity to reconcile the principle of freedom of navigation with environmental protection and safety interest.The United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea(UNCLOS) provides the obligation of States to protect marine environment and cooperate on a global and regional basis in formulating international rules for the protection of the marine environment. And UNCLOS seems to give the coastal states of ice-covered sea areas the necessary powers to prevent vessel source pollution. International rules relating the marine pollution from ships have been established by the International Maritime Organization. It adopted International Code for Ships Operating in Polar Waters(Polar Code) to amend the MARPOL 73/38 and SOLAS.Canada promulgated to protect Canada’s Arctic waters beyond territorial seas through Arctic Waters Pollution Prevention Act(AWPPA) in 1970. Canada has also operated Northern Canada Vessel Traffic Services Zone Regulations(NORDREG), ship reporting system and vessel traffic services. The Arctic Shipping Safety and Pollution Prevention Regulations(ASSPPR) was adopted to regulate the safety and pollution from ships in the Arctic. Some commentators are concerned that Canadian regulations are inconsistent with international law.It is desirable that the international organization like IMO makes uniform standards to protect the Arctic Ocean marine environment.

In this paper, we argue that multi-project EIA can, in some contexts, simultaneously deliver greater effectiveness and process streamlining. To illustrate our claim, we present a case study from offshore petroleum production in Brazil, where the development of the pre-salt giant reserves is being licensed through a multi-project EIA approach, in a non-SEA planning environment. The analysis provides interesting insights on the strengths and challenges of that strategy, focusing on five aspects of practice: cumulative impacts, efficiency, approach to authorizations, follow-up and political issues.

The resistance capacity of marine bacteria is well known, but their possible responses and their ability to recover after a CO2 release has not been investigated. Therefore, this work evaluated the responses of a marine bacterial community after 96 h of CO2 exposure under diverse pH treatments (7.8 as control without CO2, 7.0, 6.5, and 6.0) and 24 h after CO2 exposure. Results showed that the respiration activity and the diversity of the community were affected in all pH treatments. However, after 24 h without CO2 enrichment, the respiration activity and diversity increased, showing a partial recovery. Consequently, bacterial responses have the potential to be used as a monitoring tool for risk assessment related to carbon capture and storage techniques or in any similar CO2 enrichment situations.

We incorporated multi-trophic interactions into restoration by describing an ongoing functional trait-based restoration experiment in Hawaiian lowland tropical wet forest (Lao Na Pilina Experiment), where litter arthropods are examined from a functional perspective thereby linking plants and higher trophic levels. We hypothesized that (1) communities with greater plant functional trait diversity would have cascading effects through food webs, increasing animal diversity and network complexity, and (2) increases in animal species and network complexity would be stronger for restoration efforts in plant communities with more complementary functional traits than those with more redundant traits. We examined experimental treatments of planted communities with the same species richness but with different plant functional trait profiles based on (1) rates of expected carbon turnover (slow or moderate). and (2) the similarity of their functional trait measurements (redundant or complementary), as determined by functional dispersion calculations. Initial data on arthropod communities and leaf litter decomposition rates revealed linkages between plant functional traits and arthropod community diversity. Overall, we argue that a more comprehensive evaluation of restoration accounts for both functional diversity and the multi-trophic nature of animal and plant communities. Developing restoration projects based on plant functional traits that influence both plant and invertebrate species provides a new paradigm, and the incorporation of both native and non-native (but noninvasive) plants shows promise in restoring ecosystem function in disturbed lowland tropical forests.

Approximately 7.9 million liters of dispersant, Corexit EC9500A, was used during the spill between May 15th and July 12th. Marsh soil samples were collected from an unimpacted marsh site proximal to coastal areas that suffered light to heavy oiling for a laboratory evaluation to determine the effect of Corexit on the wetland soil microbial biomass as well as N-mineralization and denitrification rates. Microbial biomass nitrogen (N) values were below detection for the 1:10, 1:100 and 1:1000 Corexit:wet soil treatments. The potentially mineralizable N (PMN) rate correlated with microbial biomass with significantly lower rates for the 1:10 and 1:100 Corexit:wet soil additions. Potential denitrification rates for Corexit:wet soil ratios after immediate dispersant exposure were below detection for the 1:10 treatment, while the 1:100 was 7.6 +/- 2.7% of the control and the 1:1000 was 33 +/- 4.3% of the control. The 1:10000 treatment was not significantly different from the control. Denitrification rates measured after 2 weeks exposure to the surfactant found the 1:10 treatment still below detection limit and the 1:100 ratio was 12 +/- 2.6% of the control. Results from this lab study suggest that chemical dispersants have the potential to negatively affect the wetland soil microbial biomass and resultant microbial activity. Consequences of exposure led to reductions in several important microbial-regulated ecosystem services including water quality improvement (denitrification) and ecosystem primary productivity (N-mineralization). Future studies should investigate the longer-term impacts of dispersant exposure on the microbial consortia to determine if microbial activity recovers over time. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

One such example is management of produced waters, which are often disposed of via deep well injection. Produced water injection has been linked to induced seismicity. Thus, there are strong incentives for alternative management strategies that come with new, uncertain environmental risks. This paper summarizes studies of sediment pollution due to oil and gas production. The goal is to highlight potential environmental risks associated with produced water management, including long-term contamination of sediments. Recent Findings Sediment contaminants from produced waters include organic and inorganic toxic compounds. Three different indicators have been developed for sediment pollution: the geoaccumulation index, pollution load index, and the enrichment factor. The main pollutants in sediments resulting from oil and gas production are heavy metals, salts, naturally occurring radioactive materials (NORMs), oil and grease (O&G), benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene and xylene (BTEX), total petroleum hydrocarbon (TPH), and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAHs). These pollutants reach sediments and water resources via pipeline leaks, truck spills, improper waste disposal, and underground injection. Methods to decrease contaminant risks in sediments include surface capping, bioremediation, and phytoremediation. The shale oil and gas boom has exacerbated produced water management issues. As states consider regulation of treated produced waters, there is a strong need to consider potential contaminants of concern. Several case studies from the U.S., Middle East, Africa, Asia, and South America were used to assess levels of contamination around the world's sediments in regions with high levels of oil and gas activity. Appropriate management of residual pollution from oil and gas operations should consider the nature of contaminants and sediments, the routes of contamination, the levels of contamination, the effect of contaminants on the sites, and methods for contaminant cleanup.",,,,,,,,,22,0,0,0,13,0,25,,,2198-6592,,,,,,,,,,,"Oklahoma State Univ, Sch Civil & Environm Engn, Stillwater, OK 74078 USA",,,,2020-03-18,WOS:000516334200001,,

These provided an unprecedented opportunity to examine a wide range of climate variability experienced by the CCS and its ecosystems. By relating these climate events to regional physical and biological observations, using multiple and diverse data sources (GLOBEC and other recent observations, historical datasets, satellites, circulation and physical-biological models), the investigators will determine how these events affect mesoscale ocean variability and target populations in the CCS. The overarching goal of this project is to characterize the linkages between basin-scale variability indicative of climate events and local changes in mesoscale coastal ocean circulation and structure that impact marine populations, ecosystem structure and productivity. Correlative methods will be used initially to characterize mesoscale variability in the CCS and the concurrent basin-scale conditions during the time of the Field Program and further back where possible. Building on these correlational linkages between basin and mesoscale patterns of variability, the investigators will examine the mechanisms behind these linkages from three different points of view: comparing interannual and decadal scales of climate variability, identifying and comparing different regions of climate response in the CCS, and examining changes in the seasonal signals. From these integrative analyses, they will provide robust indicators of the response of marine populations to climate change, a useful tool for resource assessment and management. The datasets, satellite images and key metrics and indices will be served on a series of Live Access Servers (LAS) and OPeNDAP Servers, which will allow scientists, resource managers, and the public to transparently access, subset and download our data products. Some of the satellite and survey data sets will also be incorporated into curriculum material that is under development within the OSU SMILE program.

This study examined plant and sediment properties in seagrass meadows (Cymodocea nodosa (Ucria) Asch.) from two high pCO(2)-low pH Mediterranean vent systems, located at Milos (Greece) and Vulcano (Italy) Islands, providing insights on carbon storage potential in future acidified oceans. Contrary to what has been suggested, carbon content (both inorganic and organic) and its surficial accumulation decreased at high pCO(2)-low pH in comparison with controls. The decrease in inorganic carbon may result from the higher solubility of carbonates due to the more acidic conditions. At Vulcano, the seagrass properties (e.g., leaf area, biomass) appeared negatively affected by environmental conditions at high pCO(2)-low pH conditions and this may have had a detrimental effect on the organic carbon content and accumulation. At Milos, organic carbon decreased at high pCO(2)-low pH conditions, despite the increase in seagrass aboveground biomass, leaf length and area, probably as a consequence of site-specific features, which need further investigation and may include both biotic and abiotic factors (e.g., oligotrophic conditions, decreased sedimentation rate and input of allochthonous material). Results suggest that, in contrast to previous predictions based exclusively on the expected positive response of seagrasses to ocean acidification, carbon storage capacity of the seagrass C. nodosa may not increase at high pCO(2)-low pH conditions.

Stakeholder concern often focuses on the potential for local displacement caused by impact piling, where piles are hammered into the seabed. To mitigate this threat, use of vibration piling, where piles are shaken into place with a vibratory hammer, is often encouraged due to presumed impact reduction. However, data on comparative responses of cetaceans to these different noise sources are lacking. We studied the responses of bottlenose dolphins and harbor porpoises to both impact and vibration pile driving noise during harbor construction works in northeast Scotland, using passive acoustic monitoring devices to record cetacean activity and noise recorders to measure and predict received noise levels. Local abundance and patterns of occurrence of bottlenose dolphins were also compared with a five-year baseline. The median peak-to-peak source level estimated for impact piling was 240 dB re 1 lPa (single-pulse sound exposure level [SEL] 198 dB re 1 mu Pa-2 s), and the r.m.s. source level for vibration piling was 192 dB re 1 lPa. Predicted received broadband SEL values 812 m from the piling site were markedly lower due to high propagation loss: 133.4 dB re 1 mu Pa-2 s (impact) and 128.9 dB re 1 lPa2 s (vibration). Bottlenose dolphins and harbor porpoises were not excluded from sites in the vicinity of impact piling or vibration piling; nevertheless, some small effects were detected. Bottlenose dolphins spent a reduced period of time in the vicinity of construction works during both impact and vibration piling. The probability of occurrence of both cetacean species was also slightly less during periods of vibration piling. This work provides developers and managers with the first evidence of the comparative effects of vibration and impact piling on small cetaceans, enabling more informed risk assessments, policy frameworks, and mitigation plans. In particular, our results emphasize the need for better understanding of noise levels and behavioral responses to vibration piling before recommending its use to mitigate impact piling.",,,,,,,,,15,1,0,0,12,0,16,,,2150-8925,,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Aberdeen, Inst Biol & Environm Sci, Lighthouse Field Stn, George St, Cromarty IV11 8YL, Ross Shire, ScotlandCefas, Pakefield Rd, Lowestoft NR33 0HT, Suffolk, EnglandUniv St Andrews, Scottish Oceans Inst, Sea Mammal Res Unit, St Andrews KY16 8LB, Fife, Scotland",,,,2017-06-16,WOS:000402472300034,,

Excessive supply of nitrogen to salt marshes has been associated with shifts in species' distribution and production, as well as marsh degradation and loss. Our study of salt marshes in agriculturally intensive watersheds shows that coastal eutrophication can have an additional impact. We measured gas fluxes from marsh soils and verified emissions of nitrous oxide (N2O) in nitrogen-loaded marshes while the reference marsh was a sink for this gas. Salt marsh soils are extremely efficient carbon sinks, but emissions of N2O, a greenhouse gas 298 times more potent than CO2, reduces the value of the carbon sink, and in some marshes, may counterbalance any value of stored carbon towards mitigation of climate change. Although more research is merited on the nitrogen transformations and carbon storage in eutrophic marshes, the possibility of significant N2O emissions should be considered when evaluating the market value of carbon in salt marshes subject to high levels of nitrogen loading.",,,,,,,,,17,0,0,0,11,0,17,,,1748-9326,,,,,,,,,,,"St Francis Xavier Univ, Dept Earth Sci, Antigonish, NS B2G 2W5, CanadaAgr & Agri Food Canada, Sci & Technol Branch, Truro, NS B2N 2T6, CanadaMcGill Univ, Dept Geog, Montreal, PQ H3A 0B9, Canada",,,,2018-12-28,WOS:000430334200001,,

Establishing a scientific method to classify mining platforms and wells, and identifying an objective and systematic terminology, on the basis of their utility to reservoir production is becoming essential as well. The scientific literature uses a terminology for oil and gas wells, but on the contrary no international standard and common criteria are used for productive platforms. This paper aims at the proposal of a terminology and a classification method that could be adopted by the Italian Authorities for the analysis of the state of offshore Oil&Gas platforms, through the evaluation of the national database of the Italian Ministry of Economic Development - Directorate General for safety of Mining and Energy Activity (DGS-UNMIG).",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,1121-9041,,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Milan, Bicocca Secondment DGS UNMIG, Milan, ItalyGSE SpA, Rome, ItalyMinist Econ Dev, DGS UNMIG Div 6, Rome, ItalyRic Sistema Energet RSE SpA, Milan, Italy",GSE SpAMinist Econ DevRic Sistema Energet RSE SpA,,,2018-07-18,WOS:000437316100019,,

Monitoring tools are needed to assess and protect environmental health. We determined baseline values of antioxidant biomarkers (CAT, SOD, GPx, GST, MDA) for five ecologically relevant species in a subtropical system in southern Brazil. Regional baseline levels are compared with literature data as a basis to eventually test their efficacy as post-spill monitoring tools. Differences in the antioxidant response among species, contamination, and seasons were tested using univariate and multivariate analyses. The bivalves Anomalocardia flexuosa and Crassostrea rhizophorae and the catfish Genidens genidens emerge as suitable sentinel species. Seasonality is the main factor accounting for biomarkers variability, and not background contamination level. However, interactions between season and contamination level are also significant, indicating that biomarkers respond to complex environmental settings, a fact that needs to be fully understood for designing proper monitoring programs.

These forests were in Hunts Bay, Fort Rocky Lagoon (part of the Port Royal mangroves on the south shore of Kingston Harbour), and Wreck Bay (Hellshire), The vegetation assessments included the determination of species composition, floristics, and leaf litter production of the mangrove trees. Selected environmental and biological conditions were also investigated at each site. The hypothesized gradient of environmental factors, eutrophication and disturbance was Hunts Bay > Fort Rocky Lagoon > Wreck Bay. With the exception of light on the forest floor, the soil and water column parameters were all significantly different among sites, but the values did not always follow the expected environmental gradient. For example, nitrate/nitrite values were maximum at Wreck Bay (34.4 muM), followed by Hunts Bay (12.41 muM) and Fort Rocky Lagoon (10.0 muM), and phosphates ranked with maximum at Fort Rocky Lagoon (9.69 muM), then Hunts Bay (4.41 muM) and Wreck Bay (1.24 muM). Of the vegetation characteristics, only average leaf litter production and percentage cover were significantly different among sites, with a ranking similar to the hypothesis (i.e., Hunts Bay > Fort Rocky Lagoon > Wreck Bay). The most important factors influencing the distribution of productivity and percentage cover among forests were soil salinity, soil NO3, especially the nitrate to phosphate ratio, soil moisture content and soil temperature with R-2 values of 0.77 for litter production and 0.64 for percentage cover. Other factors such as diameter at breast height and tree height were not significantly different among forests and showed a weak relationship with edaphic factors. Overall results indicated that the forests were very different with respect to physicochemical and edaphic factors, and there was a clear gradient of eutrophication. However, the effect of anthropogenic stress and varying environmental conditions is most reliably demonstrated in the productivity and percentage cover of the forests.",,,,,,,,,8,0,0,0,6,1,8,,,0007-4977,1553-6955,,,,,,,,,,"Univ W Indies, Dept Life Sci, Kingston 7, Jamaica",,,,2003-09-01,WOS:000188880600016,,

The shoreline positions were established based on a map (1927), orthophotos (2009) and a topographic survey with differential Global Positioning System (GPS) (summer 2019). Detailed geomorphological and surface sediment mapping was conducted to form a framework for understanding shoreline-landscape interaction. The shoreline was divided into three sectors to calculate the erosion/stability/accretion rates by using the DSAS (Digital Shoreline Analysis System) extension of ArcGIS. The DSAS analysis showed very high erosion in Sector 1, while Sectors 2 and 3 showed moderate accretion and moderate erosion, respectively. Sector 1 is geologically composed of easily erodible sorted beach sediments and protected remains from the mining industry such as wrecks of heavy machines, loading carts, wagons and rusty tracks that are directly exposed to coastal erosion. The all-sector average shoreline erosion rate (EPR parameter) for the 92 years period was -0.21 m/year. The high shoreline erosion rates in Sector 1, together with the high potential damage to cultural heritage, supports the urgent need of continued coastal monitoring and sustainable management of cultural heritage in Hiorthhamn.",,,,,,,,,22,1,0,0,3,0,24,,,,2071-1050,,,,,,,,,,"Norwegian Inst Cultural Heritage Res NIKU, Fram Ctr, High North Dept, N-9296 Tromso, NorwayGeol Survey Norway NGU, Fram Ctr, N-9296 Tromso, NorwayGeol Survey Norway NGU, POB 6315, N-7491 Trondheim, NorwayUniv Ctr Svalbard UNIS, Arctic Geol Dept, POB 156, N-9171 Longyearbyen, NorwayNorwegian Inst Cultural Heritage Res NIKU, Storgata 2, N-0155 Oslo, Norway",Norwegian Inst Cultural Heritage Res NIKUNorwegian Inst Cultural Heritage Res NIKU,,,2020-04-21,WOS:000523751400153,,

This small area of prevailing meadows hold significant carbon stores accumulated over the past 3000 years. In this study, we sampled three sediment cores from a Posidonia australis meadow and analysed organic matter (OM), organic carbon (OC) and inorganic carbon (IC) contents in bulk sediments, and delta C-13 signatures of OM. The OM and CC contents (mean +/- SE) in the cores were 9.07 +/- 0.36% and 2.24 +/- 0.05%, respectively. The mean IC content was 3.16 +/- 0.17%. delta C-13 signatures of the sedimentary OM ranged from -10.01%0 to -13.28%D. Using a Bayesian isotopic mixing model, it is estimated that 57-67% of the OM in the seagrass sediments was derived from P. australis detrital matter. The total carbon (TC) stores in 150 cm-thick seagrass sediments averaged 27.92 kg TC m(-2) (10.79 kg OC m(-2) and 17.13 kg IC m(-2)). Based on radiocarbon dating, the mean sediment accumulation rate was 0.0494 cm yr(-1), which led to a long-term TC accumulation rate of 8.92 g TC m(-2) yr(-1) (3.45 g OC m(-2) yr(-1) and 5.47 g IC m(-2) yr(-1)). Based on historical seagrass cover (3.6-6.7 km(2) during the 19605 to 19805), the estimated TC stores in 150 cm-thick seagrass sediments at Oyster Harbour would have been 101-187 Gg TC. The eutrophication-driven loss of seagrasses during the 1980s resulted in the absence of CC accumulation capacity amounting to 280-310 Mg OC (over 29 years).

We tested a hypothesis of the importance of a power balance among propagule resilience and sedimentary and tidal disturbances for vegetation reestablishment. Our experiment used three types of propagules (seeds, seedlings, and corms) of native Scirpus species in the fringing flats with similar tidal flows and varying sedimentary intensities in the Yangtze Estuary. Regardless of the initial planting densities, the seed germination rate was extremely low in the field situation. Although the incubated seedlings were planted directly on the bare flat, the wave movement easily flushed the seedlings, even at the site with moderate sedimentary accretion. Failure of the revegetation practice using the seed and seedling materials indicated that the combined growing and anchoring power of young seedlings and stabilizing power of the sediment were insufficient to withstand the dislodging power of the tidal energy. In contrast, the planting approach with underground propagules (corms) proved to be feasible for vegetation establishment at the sites with moderate and low-level sedimentary intensities. The successful practice improved the tipping point of plant survival and tussock formation could be surpassed when the combined growing and anchoring power of seedlings that developed from corms with the stabilizing power of the sediment was greater than the dislodging power of the wave energy. However, at the site with high-level sedimentary intensity, the excessive sediment converted to the burying stress power as seedlings developed from the corms, revealing a burial threshold for seedling survival. The risk of seedling establishment was high when the burying stress power of the sediment far outweighed the combination of the growing power of the seedlings and the sediment removal power of the tidal current and surpassed the tipping point of vegetation die-off. Additionally, we checked the practice cost of the different approaches to ensure a highly cost-effective revegetation planning based on site suitability. This study highlights that understanding of the propagule-sediment-tide power balance offers a tool for improvement of the revegetation and management of site-specific sedimentary and hydrological environments for many degraded coastal ecosystems.",,,,,,,,,11,2,0,0,8,0,13,,,1051-0761,1939-5582,,,,,,,,,,"East China Normal Univ, Inst Ecochongming, State Key Lab Estuarine & Coastal Res, Shanghai 200241, Peoples R ChinaEast China Normal Univ, Ctr Global Change & Ecol Forecasting, Shanghai 200241, Peoples R ChinaWenzhou Fisheries Technol Extens Serv, Wenzhou 325000, Peoples R China",Wenzhou Fisheries Technol Extens Serv,,,2019-08-26,WOS:000479578400001,31257690,

The species continues to face a suite of contemporary threats, including pollution, ship strikes, fisheries interactions, habitat loss and degradation, oil spills, and anthropogenic noise. The sperm whale stock in the northern Gulf of Mexico was exposed to oil from the Deepwater Horizon (DWH) oil spill and is exposed to high levels of anthropogenic noises generated by geological and geophysical (G&G) surveys for hydrocarbon deposits. Population impacts from oil and gas activities were predicted from models that incorporated two stressors: (i) oil exposure from DWH and (ii) noise from G&G surveys. Oil exposure was projected to reduce survival and reproductive success, causing a mean stock decline of 26% by 2025. Additionally, exposure to underwater noise can adversely impact whale hearing, communication, foraging efficiency, and disturb essential behaviors. Exposures to G&G survey noise were determined by simulating individual movements through three-dimensional sound fields generated by different survey methods. Behavioral disturbance was evaluated as reduced foraging opportunities under four dose-response functions. Bioenergetic models tracked the depletion of reserves in blubber, muscle, and viscera. All simulations suggested significant reductions in relative fitness of reproductive females were a likely consequence of persistent disturbances to foraging behaviors. Under a 160 dB SPL unweighted dose-response function, up to 4.4 +/- 0.3% of the stock may reach terminal starvation due to behavioral disturbance associated with future G&G surveys, leading to abortions, calf abandonment, and up to 25% greater stock declines beyond those predicted from DWH oil exposure. Uncertainty in our results emphasizes a need for further controlled exposure experiments to generate behavioral disturbance dose-response curves and detailed evaluation of individual resilience following disturbance events. Given our focus on a limited suite of threats and need for field verification of these modeled impacts, precautionary management application of our results is recommended for this endangered species.",,,,,,,,,24,0,0,0,17,0,26,,,0006-3207,1873-2917,,,,,,,,,,"NOAA, Natl Marine Fisheries Serv, Southeast Reg Off, 263 13th Ave S, St Petersburg, FL 33701 USABur Ocean Energy Management, Off Renewable Energy Programs, 45600 Woodland Rd, Sterling, VA 20166 USAJASCO Appl Sci, Suite 218,8630 Fenton St, Silver Spring, MD 20910 USANOAA, Natl Marine Fisheries Serv, Northwest Fisheries Sci Ctr, 2725 Montlake Blvd East, Seattle, WA 98112 USANOAA, Natl Marine Fisheries Serv, Southeast Fisheries Sci Ctr, 75 Virginia Beach Dr, Miami, FL 33149 USANOAA, JPS Inc, Natl Marine Fisheries Serv, Southeast Reg Off, 263 13th Ave S, St Petersburg, FL 33701 USAJASCO Appl Sci, Suite 202,32 Troop Ave, Dartmouth, NS B3B 1Z1, Canada",Bur Ocean Energy ManagementJASCO Appl SciJASCO Appl Sci,,,2018-12-28,WOS:000449129700021,,

During the last century, however, human activities were not always rational and sustainable. In this context, the energy and metal resources are characterised with a due consideration on the uneven distribution and dynamic increase of the Earth's human population, both resulting from interplay of natural and socioeconomic factors at a global scale. These two groups of resources are fundamental constituents for production of material and development of civilisations. Against the backdrop of the identified conflict areas between Man and Nature, a contention is put forth that sustained development in the 21st century depends on access to the resources of the world oceans.Oceanic resources are characterized against the background of the world's supply and demand of mineral resource. When analysing the varying rate at which the demand for resources has been increasing over the last fifty years, attention is being paid in numerous countries to the changes in spatial structure of resource exploitation, depletion of rich deposits, and a restricted access to resources as experienced. The most pronounced changes in the world-wide use of resources, including the fossil fuels and metal ores, have been taken place in the second half of the 20th century. The predicted increase in demand for raw materials as well as the limitations in access determine the changes in spatial structure of resource exploitation and trigger actions aimed at securing the access within the system of global integration. The existing, important restrictions in access to ocean resources are emphasized; those restrictions are related to expansion, on the part of numerous coastal states, of the outer border of the continental shelf up to 350 nautical miles off shore.Changes in the global structure of fossil fuel utilisation serve as a backdrop for discussing changes in the spatial structure of exploitation of oil, gas, and their primary global geological resources. The increasing importance of offshore deposits in the oil and gas exploitation is underlined. The primary importance of the Atlantic and Arctic seas in terms of their share of rich oil/gas-bearing basins is demonstrated. The promise offered by the oceanic gas hydrate deposits is emphasized as well.The potential for satisfying mankind's demand for metals in the 21st century has been evaluated, based on the so-called global metallogenic potential of the Earth, calculated for a certain period as a sum of the resources mined during historical time as well as the reliable and prognostic resources. The most recent data show that, until 1995, mankind had used up 20 - 70% of the metal deposits. The metal resources of Pb, Sri, Sb, Ag, An, Zn, Cu and Ni have been used most extensively, where as the lowest rate of use have been reported for the Fe, Mn, Cr, Co, and bauxite. It has been predicted that the demand for Zn will increase by the factor of 3.81; 3.42, 2.19, 1.86, 1.72, 1.45, 1.32, 1.14, and 1.15 are the increase factors of the demand for the Co, Ni, Cu, Sb, Sn, Pb, Mn, and An, respectively. In the 21st century, the oceanic deep sea polymetallic resources will be increasingly important in suppressing deficiency of such metals as Mn, Ni, Cu, Co, Mo, Pt, Ag, Bi, An, and REE.",,,,,4th ISOPE Ocean Mining Symposium4th ISOPE Ocean Mining Symposium,"SEP 23-27, 2001SEP 23-27, 2001",Int Soc Offshore & Polar Engineers; Interoceanmetal Joint OrgInt Soc Offshore & Polar Engineers; Interoceanmetal Joint Org,"Szezecin, POLANDSzezecin, POLAND",10,0,0,0,0,0,10,,,,,1-880653-56-7,,,,,,,,,"Tech Univ Szczecin, Interoceanmet Joint Org, PL-71065 Szczecin, Poland",,,,2001-01-01,WOS:000189499100001,,

Global climate change is already having major impacts on Arctic ecosystems. Increasing temperatures and reductions in sea ice are particular conservation concerns for ice-associated species, including three endemic cetaceans that have evolved in or joined the Arctic sympagic community over the last 5 M years. Sea ice losses are also a major stimulant to increased industrial interest in the Arctic in previously ice-covered areas. The impacts of climate change are expected to continue and will likely intensify in coming decades. This paper summarizes information on the distribution and movement patterns of the three ice-associated cetacean species that reside year-round in the Arctic, the narwhal (Monodon monoceros), beluga (white whale, Delphinapterus leucas), and bowhead whale (Balaena mysticetus). It maps their current distribution and identifies areas of seasonal aggregation, particularly focussing on high-density occurrences during the summer. Sites of oil and gas exploration and development and routes used for commercial shipping in the Arctic are compared with the distribution patterns of the whales, with the aim of highlighting areas of special concern for conservation. Measures that should be considered to mitigate the impacts of human activities on these Arctic whales and the aboriginal people who depend on them for subsistence include: careful planning of ship traffic lanes (re-routing if necessary) and ship speed restrictions; temporal or spatial closures of specified areas (e.g. where critical processes for whales such as calving, calf rearing, resting, or intense feeding take place) to specific types of industrial activity; strict regulation of seismic surveys and other sources of loud underwater noise; and close and sustained monitoring of whale populations in order to track their responses to environmental disturbance.

However, the ability to generalize current studies is limited by the small geographic scope as well as limited breadth and integration of measured chemical and biological indicators parameters. This study tested the hypothesis that a quantifiable, significant relationship exists between the density of oil and gas (OG) development, increasing stream water concentrations of known geochemical tracers of OG extraction, and the composition of benthic macroinvertebrate and microbial communities. Twenty-five headwater streams that drain lands across a gradient of shale gas development intensity were sampled. Our strategy included comprehensive measurements across multiple seasons of sampling to account for temporal variability of geochemical parameters, including known shale OG geochemical tracers, and microbial and benthic macroinvertebrate communities. No significant relationships were found between the intensity of OG development, shale OG geochemical tracers, or benthic macroinvertebrate or microbial community composition, whereas significant seasonal differences in stream chemistry were observed. These results highlight the importance of considering spatial and temporal variability in stream chemistry and biota and not only the presence of anthropogenic activities in a watershed.

This MHW was caused by large-scale atmospheric ridging and affected fisheries and ecosystems from Alaska through California, including a bloom of toxic algae spanning the entire coastline. Regional variations in MHW severity are common along coastlines worldwide but are generally unexplained. During the 2014-16 MHW, the summertime sea-surface temperature (SST) anomalies were often stronger along the southern half of the coastline off the western continental United States. The reason for this north-south difference in severity of the MHW within the California Current System (CCS) has remained unclear. The scientific community's lack of understanding of regional variations within MHWs prevents accurate prediction of SST anomalies and resulting ecological and economic impacts. We show the north-south difference in SST anomalies was due to a known wind pattern determined by the coastline shape. The wind anomalies in summer have a quasi-dipole structure: the northern lobe extends southwest from Washington/Oregon, and the southern lobe has opposite sign and extends south from Cape Mendocino in a triangle due to a hydraulic expansion fan in the marine boundary layer. The alternating wind intensifications and relaxations typically last several days. However, the large-scale ridging during the MHW was associated with unusual persistence in this pattern: in summer 2015 a single wind relaxation in the southern lobe lasted 2 weeks. These wind anomalies induce changes in SST, likely via changes in wind-driven vertical entrainment of cold water from below the mixed layer, and mixed-layer shoaling; the net air-sea heat flux anomaly is small. The July 2015 wind relaxation persisted so long that the changes in SST exceeded pre-existing SST variations. The resulting SST anomalies have a dipole pattern similar to the wind anomalies. These dipole SST anomalies explain the north-south asymmetry in the CCS MHW. We suggest that during future persistent ridging events, the SST anomalies off the western continental U.S. will develop a north-south split structure similar to July 2015.

Secure, efficient communications is required between remote, isolated locations and head offices to report on work status, dispatch supplies and repairs, report on-site emergencies, transfer geophysical surveys and real-time drilling data. Drilling and exploration firms have traditionally used land-based terrestrial networks that rely on radio transmissions for voice and data communications to offshore platforms and remote deep desert drilling rigs. But these systems are inefficient and have proven inflexible with today's drilling and exploration communications demands, which include high-speed data access, telephone and video conferencing. In response, numerous oil and gas exploration entities working in deep waters and remote deep deserts have all tapped into what is an ideal solution for these needs: Very Small Aperture Terminal Systems (VSAT) for broadband access services. This led to the use of Satellite Communication Systems for a wide range of applications that were difficult to achieve in the past, such as real-time applications transmission of drilling data and seismic information.This paper provides a thorough analysis of opportunities for satellite technology solutions in support of oil and gas operations.

Seven years of data were used to investigate the influence of Construction-Related Activity (CRA) on the occurrence of dolphins in the bay where the pipeline made landfall. CRA varied substantially over the seven years and included dredging, pipe-laying, and rock armouring as well as seismic surveys. While individual activities could not be examined in isolation, there was no evidence of aggregated CRA or season influencing occurrence, despite a greater number of CRA days during summer months. There was weak support for the influence of year, but lower occurrence rates did not correspond to years with more CRA days, or vice versa. The uncorrected (marked animals, only) and corrected (accounting for unmarked individuals) annual abundance estimates with the lowest coefficient of variation were 67 (95% CI = 62-84; CV = 0.08) and 140 (95% CI = 106-174; CV = 0.12) in 2010, which was comparable to estimates from a neighbouring region on the west coast of Ireland. Of the well-marked individuals approximately 50% were re-sighted in two or more years and re-sightings within years were as high as 70%. Overall, there was little evidence to suggest that the extended period of CRA resulted in a short- or long-term reduction in the occurrence of dolphins within the bay. However, given the relatively coarse spatial and temporal scale of the CRA data it was not possible to assess fine-scale movements, such as redistribution within the bay in response to CRA within the immediate area. To better inform management and mitigation practices, greater emphasis should be placed on designing robust monitoring programmes that focus beyond fine-scale displacement as the sole indicator of an impact.

The purpose of this paper is to identify key outsourced activities and to explore their influence on the organizational performance of the targeted locally owned oil and gas companies in Ghana. Also, the study explores key benefits and challenges associated with adopting outsourcing strategies.Design/methodology/approach - The primary data were collected using a survey from 80 participants working for different oil and gas companies in Ghana.Findings - The study revealed that most of the outsourced activities include transport services, information technology (IT) consulting and business consulting services, system infrastructure provision and management and logistical services. Also, key outsourcing reasons were reducing operational costs, avoiding major investment costs in technology, providing consistent and improved service delivery, accessing current technology and expert knowledge and focusing more on core business activities. Outsourcing is significant to enhance the performance of an oil and gas company; however, outsourcing could also result in the conflict of firm culture with outsourced vendors, and inefficient management and loss of innovative capacity are possible negative effects of outsourcing.Research limitations/implications - The study targeted mainly locally owned oil and gas companies operating in Greater Accra regions of Ghana and including other areas is recommended in the future. Also, the research sample size was 80 participants for this study, and a larger sample should be used in the future.Originality/value - There is a paucity of research in management outsourcing in Ghana's oil and gas industry. To the best knowledge of the authors, this study presents the first research of its kind and the findings will be valuable for the targeted companies. The results from this study can also be used by other companies operating in similar oil and gas business environments operating in other oil and gas producing countries particularly in Africa and Asia.

The Monte Carlo (MC) method is used to simulate the random distribution of landing points. The hit probability on pipelines and the mean radii derived from DROBS are estimated. Further, half-normal distribution (HND) is adopted to estimate the horizontal excursion of the falling point, based on such lateral deviation. Finally, the mean radii derived from DROBS and HND methods are compared with the results using Det Norske Veritas' simplified method. Our results show that such a simplified method may introduce larger errors to the calculation of hit probability and mean radii.

Larvae of the brooding coral, Porites astreoides, and the broadcast spawning coral, Montastraea faveolata, were exposed to multiple concentrations of BP Horizon source oil (crude, weathered and WAF), oil in combination with the dispersant Corexit (R) 9500 (CEWAF), and dispersant alone, and analyzed for behavior, settlement, and survival. Settlement and survival of P. astreoides and M. faveolata larvae decreased with increasing concentrations of WAF, CEWAF and Corexit (R) 9500, however the degree of the response varied by species and solution. P. astreoides larvae experienced decreased settlement and survival following exposure to 0.62 ppm source oil, while M. faveolata larvae were negatively impacted by 0.65, 1.34 and 1.5 ppm, suggesting that P. astreoides larvae may be more tolerant to WAF exposure than M. faveolata larvae. Exposure to medium and high concentrations of CEWAF (4.28/18.56 and 30.99/35.76 ppm) and dispersant Corexit (R) 9500 (50 and 100 ppm), significantly decreased larval settlement and survival for both species. Furthermore, exposure to Corexit (R) 9500 resulted in settlement failure and complete larval mortality after exposure to 50 and 100 ppm for M. faveolata and 100 ppm for P. astreoides. These results indicate that exposure of coral larvae to oil spill related contaminants, particularly the dispersant Corexit (R) 9500, has the potential to negatively impact coral settlement and survival, thereby affecting the resilience and recovery of coral reefs following exposure to oil and dispersants.",,,,,,,,,120,1,0,0,93,0,147,,,1932-6203,,,,,,,,,,,"Mote Marine Lab, Sarasota, FL 34236 USA",,,,2013-01-09,WOS:000313551500001,23326298,

Foundations based on post tensioned pile anchors can be effectively proposed to tackle this issue. A series of full-scale direct shear tests were performed on-shore to evaluate the shear resistance of post-tensioned pile anchor foundations designed for securing tidal turbine devices to a rock seabed. We focused, in particular, on the primary shear resistance mechanism of post tensioned anchors, by applying a vertical force which mobilizes, a frictional force able to resist horizontal thrusts. Different load paths, involving monotonic or cyclic loading, were applied; several configurations for the footing of the foundation were tested. The footing stress-displacement behavior and the stress conditions at sliding failure from a number of different testing configurations were compared and analyzed. A marked consistency with the shear performance of natural rock joints was identified. This allows the behavior of tension pile foundations subjected to substantial horizontal loads to be modeled using relationships developed for rock joints, widely available in the literature. Additionally, the results obtained from different tests were also collated considering the various configurations adopted for the foundation-rock system and the applied load paths, to identify the factors that affect the shear resistance of the foundation.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,0029-8018,,,,,,,,,,,"Queens Univ Belfast, Sch Nat & Built Environm, Stranmillis Rd, Belfast BT9 5AG, Antrim, North IrelandMcLaughlin & Harvey Ltd, 15 Trench Rd, Newtownabbey BT36 4TY, North IrelandETH, Schweizer Erdbebendienst, Sonneggstr 5, CH-8092 Zurich, SwitzerlandFast Engn Ltd, 5 Windmill Court, Belfast BT41 2TX, Antrim, North IrelandGavin & Doherty Geosolut Engn UK Ltd, 7 Donegall Sq West, Belfast BT1 6JH, Antrim, North Ireland",McLaughlin & Harvey LtdFast Engn LtdGavin & Doherty Geosolut Engn UK Ltd,,,2017-03-29,WOS:000394064300008,,

Prior to the confinement of the Eraser River to its present channels, during the early part of this century, the distributary river channels regularly switched and migrated across the entire delta front. The annual river load (approximately 17.3 x 10(6) tonnes) is 65% silt and clay, and 35% sand. Today, most of the sand is removed from the system by dredging and the mud is transported in a plume past the intertidal estuary and northwards into the basin by the dominant flood tidal flow. Three causeways that cross the intertidal zone to the delta foreslope act as barriers to the dominant northward sediment transport causing estuarine and localized seabed erosion. The presence of the causeways results in tidal flow separation with clockwise back eddies forming behind the structures focusing the tidal energy to the intertidal zone. On the delta foreslope, off the southern causeways, an eroded submarine distributary channel subaqueous fan complex has been exposed by enhanced tidal flows that scour the seabed and form northward migrating subaqueous dunes increasing the delta slope and, consequently, the risk of slope failure.",,,,,,,,,21,0,0,0,6,0,24,,,0749-0208,,,,,,,,,,,"Geol Survey Canada, Pacific Geosci Ctr, Sidney, BC V8L 4B2, Canada",,,,2000-06-01,WOS:000089758800019,,

Six paleogeographic interpretations was made consist of; Early Tertiary (P5-56-55 ma), Middle Eocene (P14-41 ma), Late Oiligocene (P22-25.5 ma), Early Miocene (N7-16.5 ma), Middle Miocene (N9-14.5 ma), and Pleistocene (NN19-1.5 ma). That six paleogeographic interpretations are assumed represent the paleogeographic evolution of East Java Basin time after time. In Middle Eocene time, it would be more than hundred possibilities regarding the location where the formation deposited. This would be controlled by the existence of some local structural paleohighs and horsts which oriented NW-SE followed by their own sedimentary transportation path.

Previous research suggests that microbial communities from deep-sea sediment (> 1000m) can degrade hydrocarbons (HCs), but have a lower degradation ability than shallow (< 200m) communities, probably due to in situ temperature. This study aimed to assess the effect of marine origin on microbial HC degradation potential while separating the influence of temperature, and to characterise associated HC-degrading bacterial communities. Microbial communities from 135 and 1000 m deep sediments were selectively enriched on crude oil at in situ temperatures and both consortia were subsequently incubated for 42 days at 20 degrees C with two HC mixtures: diesel fuel or model oil. Significant HC biodegradation occurred rapidly in the presence of both consortia, especially of low molecular weight HCs and was concomitant with microbial community changes. Further, oil degradation was higher with the shallow consortium than with the deep one.

J,,,,,,,,,Patricia Erskine,,Carbon Capture and Storage Interactive: CCSI - Edinburgh,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Awarded Grant,Feb 01 2009,2009,"Most of world's energy currently derives from combustion of fossil fuel. The UK is no exception. A key environmental problem is that fossil fuel combustion releases CO2 to the atmosphere. This is now, beyond reasonable doubt, linked to global warming and climate change. Atmospheric CO2 also dissolves in ocean water, forcing an increased acidity greater than any time in the past 20 Million years. Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) is predicted by many authoritive studies to form 25% to 50% of the future remedy (including the International Energy Agency, Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, Stern Review and Batelle Labs Energy Review). CCS technologies are likely to become a major element in the energy strategies of countries such as the UK, US and Australia who wish to reduce their reliance on imported energy and who wish to reduce atmospheric CO2, which is linked to global warming, climage change and ocean acidification. Scotland has some unique opportunities to offer in skills in CCS and also to offer sites for CO2 storage deep below the North Sea. In Edinburgh we have created the UK's largest research group on Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS). Research in the group spans from underground geology and geophysics, to chemical engineering capturing CO2 at large power plants, and also soil sciences and agricultural practice to capture CO2 from the atmosphere and return that to soid as long-lived charcoal. These are tremendously exciting areas of research, which are vital to today's society because they will play a key role in reduction of excess CO2 in the atmosphere. Climate change and energy policy are topics which schools are keen to address, but there is currently little support provided to schools to help young people, educators and parents understand the concepts and implications of CCS technologies. This proposal aims to address the gap by providing interactives to explain the concept and also the means for taking them into schools. We are therefore confident in the success of our proposal because we have brought together excellent research which has not been the subject of very much public engagement activity, with a very well regarded and tried and tested vehicle for science communication in secondary schools. The proposal is to build an interactive demonstrator which helps to communicate the concepts of Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) technologies. The CCS research team will work with the SCI-FUN Roadshow team to produce an attractive and engaging interactive which conveys the following three main concepts:1. The problem - the effects of too much CO2 in the environment causing climate change and ocean acidification2. Technologies for capturing CO2 at power plant and the essential associated separation processes 3. Control methods to remove CO2 e.g. making biofuel and geological burial. The research team will then use the interactive in the public engagement activities of the Scottish Centre for Carbon Storage. These are mainly focused on policymakers and the general public. SCI-FUN will trial incorporation of a CCS interactive as part of the SCI-FUN Science and Technology Roadshow which tours Scottish schools. SCI-FUN has been operating in its current form for seven years and in that time it has developed excellent relationships with Scottish Secondary School teachers. SCI-FUN has a level of 85 per cent repeat visits to schools where it has been before. Follow up evaluation with the schools and local authorities gives consistently positive feedback. Recent feedback was very positive about the introduction of new shows which incorporate contemporary research. Teachers commented that a new Climate Change show which incorporated some information about CCS fitted well with science curriculum links and also geography. This PPE project therefore brings the opportunity to trial the introduction of a new interactive based on contemporary research.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,EP/G02037X/1,,,,,,,,University of Edinburgh,,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:15356952,,

At regional scales, however, plant species richness is mostly increasing rather than decreasing because successful plant species introductions far outnumber extinctions. If these regional increases in richness lead to local increases in diversity, a reasonable prediction is that productivity, carbon storage, and nutrient cycling will increase following invasion, yet this prediction has rarely been tested empirically. We tested this prediction in novel forest communities dominated by introduced species (similar to 90% basal area) in lowland Hawaiian rain forests by comparing their functionality to that of native forests. We conducted our comparison along a natural gradient of increasing nitrogen availability, allowing for a more detailed examination of the role of plant functional trait differences (specifically, N-2 fixation) in driving possible changes to ecosystem function. Hawaii is emblematic of regional patterns of species change; it has much higher regional plant richness than it did historically, due to >1000 plant species introductions and only; 71 known plant extinctions, resulting in an similar to 100% increase in richness. At local scales, we found that novel forests had significantly higher tree species richness and higher diversity of dominant tree species. We further found that aboveground biomass, productivity, nutrient turnover (as measured by soil-available and litter-cycled nitrogen and phosphorus), and belowground carbon storage either did not differ significantly or were significantly greater in novel relative to native forests. We found that the addition of introduced N-2-fixing tree species on N-limited substrates had the strongest effect on ecosystem function, a pattern found by previous empirical tests. Our results support empirical predictions of the functional effects of diversity, but they also suggest basic ecosystem processes will continue even after dramatic losses of native species diversity if simple functional roles are provided by introduced species. Because large portions of the Earth's surface are undergoing similar transitions from native to novel ecosystems, our results are likely to be broadly applicable.",,,,,,,,,88,3,0,0,76,2,101,,,0012-9615,1557-7015,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Wisconsin, Dept Biol Sci, Milwaukee, WI 53211 USAUS Forest Serv, Inst Pacific Isl Forestry, USDA, Hilo, HI 96720 USASmithsonian Trop Res Inst, Balboa, Panama",,,,2012-05-01,WOS:000304370800005,,

It would be significant to develop a composite index linking the major aspects of safety including the cultural and climatic factors to provide a more representative picture of platforms' safety performance.

Preparations for a commercial phase are underway in Scotland with the allocation of seabed leases to developers in the seas around Orkney; just in advance of Scotland's first detailed marine spatial plan which is under preparation in the area. Anxiety to build confidence in a new and nationally important industrial sector conflicts with a plethora of uncertainties about technology and impacts on the natural environment and existing uses. Marine Spatial Planning (MSP) will help to build a new governance structure for marine space but in the Pentland Firth and Orkney Waters (PFOW) area it is struggling to catch up with the pace of events. This paper identifies the political objectives driving development and the impact on decision making in areas under clear and present pressure from new activities. It argues that the PFOW area is of special interest highlighting issues which will be of widespread and generic influence in the future. A governance structure based on central authority in decision making is emerging.

Understanding changes to particle number concentration and size distributions is important to constraining estimates of the effect of anthropogenic activity on the region. During six years of semi-continuous measurements of particle number size distributions conducted near Utqiagvik (Barrow), Alaska, 37 particle-growth events were observed. The majority of events occurred during spring and summer with a monthly maximum in June, similar to other Arctic sites. Based on backward air mass trajectory analysis, similar numbers of particle growth events were influenced by marine (46%) and Prudhoe Bay air masses (33%), despite air primarily coming from the Arctic Ocean (75 +/- 2% of days) compared to Prudhoe Bay (8 +/- 2% of days). The corresponding normalized particle-growth event frequency suggests that emissions from Prudhoe Bay could induce an average of 92 particle-growth events, more than all other air mass sources combined, at Barrow annually. Prudhoe Bay is currently the third largest oil and gas field in the United States, and development in the Arctic region is expected to expand throughout the 21st century as the extent of summertime sea ice decreases. Elevated particle number concentrations due to human activity are likely to have profound impacts on climate change in the Arctic through direct, indirect, and surface albedo feedbacks, particularly through the addition of cloud condensation nuclei.

Sediments undergoing diagenesis range in age from Paleocene to Miocene, indicating that overburden thickness and temperature are the main controlling factors for the onset of diagenesis, whereas the diagenetic potential of sediments is controlled by composition and burial conditions.",,,,,,,,,6,0,0,0,0,0,6,,,0028-8306,1175-8791,,,,,,,,,,"GNS Sci, Dept Marine Geosci, Wellington, New ZealandVictoria Univ Wellington, Sch Geog Environm & Earth Sci, Wellington, New ZealandGeol Survey New Caledonia, Dept Ind Mines & Energy, Noumea, New Caledonia",Geol Survey New Caledonia,,,2018-04-03,WOS:000427900600007,,

The test case is the gas turbine-based power system serving an offshore platform in the North Sea.Results indicate that the organic Rankine cycle technology presents larger performances compared to steam Rankine cycle units, whereas the implementation of air bottoming cycle modules is not attractive from an economic and environmental perspective compared to the other two technologies.Despite the relatively high cost of the expander and of the primary heat exchanger, organic Rankine cycle turbogenerators appear thus to be the preferred solution to abate CO2 emissions and pollutants on oil and gas facilities.As a practical consequence, this paper provides guidelines for the design of high-efficiency, cost-competitive and low-weight power systems for offshore installations.

To obtain risk values in mentioning area: 1) we have been analyzing CO2 migrations in relation with various geological properties including flow rate of aquifers, faults, by laboratory experiments and numerical simulations. 2) We also have been analyzing dispersion of CO2 from ground surface to ambient air using ADMER 2.5 simulation program. 3) Our analysis about marine environments has just started. Diffusion of CO2 and heavy metals, and their impact on benthos and marine planktons is going to be analyzed by experimental and simulation studies. 4) As regard with risks in ground surface, we are evaluating CO2 related safety risk levels of injection facilities by analogical industrial accident statistics including high-pressure gas laboratories. We are developing risk assessment tool, named GERAS-CO2GS (Geo-environmental Risk Assessment System, CO2 Geological Storage Risk Assessment System), to analyze risks in relation with migration of injected CO2, and to assist safety and risk management. At this moment, GERAS-CO2GS calculates CO2 retention and leakage of geological strata models. We are going to add some risk scenarios including near ground surface and sea, so that the system will evaluate total risks of geological CCS. We are going to combine results of above-mentioned researches into GERAS-CO2GS program accordingly. On the other hand, risk data will be stored in GERAS-CO2GS categorized by endpoints. It is expected that development of GERAS-CO2GS will contribute to risk assessment of the individual injection sites. It will facilitate understanding of risks around geological CCS by legislators and peoples around injection site. (C) 2013 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

This MHW was caused by large-scale atmospheric ridging and affected fisheries and ecosystems from Alaska through California, including a bloom of toxic algae spanning the entire coastline. Regional variations in MHW severity are common along coastlines worldwide but are generally unexplained. During the 2014-16 MHW, the summertime sea-surface temperature (SST) anomalies were often stronger along the southern half of the coastline off the western continental United States. The reason for this north-south difference in severity of the MHW within the California Current System (CCS) has remained unclear. The scientific community's lack of understanding of regional variations within MHWs prevents accurate prediction of SST anomalies and resulting ecological and economic impacts. We show the north-south difference in SST anomalies was due to a known wind pattern determined by the coastline shape. The wind anomalies in summer have a quasi-dipole structure: the northern lobe extends southwest from Washington/Oregon, and the southern lobe has opposite sign and extends south from Cape Mendocino in a triangle due to a hydraulic expansion fan in the marine boundary layer. The alternating wind intensifications and relaxations typically last several days. However, the large-scale ridging during the MHW was associated with unusual persistence in this pattern: in summer 2015 a single wind relaxation in the southern lobe lasted 2 weeks. These wind anomalies induce changes in SST, likely via changes in wind-driven vertical entrainment of cold water from below the mixed layer, and mixed-layer shoaling: the net air-sea heat flux anomaly is small. The July 2015 wind relaxation persisted so long that the changes in SST exceeded pre-existing SST variations. The resulting SST anomalies have a dipole pattern similar to the wind anomalies. These dipole SST anomalies explain the north-south asymmetry in the CCS MHW. We suggest that during future persistent ridging events, the SST anomalies off the western continental U.S. will develop a north-south split structure similar to July 2015.",,,,,,,,,17,0,0,0,7,0,18,,,,2296-7745,,,,,,,,,,"Oregon State Univ, Coll Earth Ocean & Atmospher Sci, Corvallis, OR 97331 USAOregon State Univ, Coll Pharm, Dept Pharmaceut Sci, Corvallis, OR 97331 USAOregon State Univ, Coll Engn, Sch Chem Biol & Environm Engn, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA",,,,2019-10-17,WOS:000489018200001,,

The endobenthos in different docks has been recently studied and the results (BRETON et al., in print) are given in the present study.The port of Le Havre (42 degrees 29' N; 0 degrees 07' E) is located at the end of Bay of Seine, in the eastern English Channel. From the entrance of this port up to its far end can be listed the following varieties of docks:- tidal docks, directly connected to open sea; tidal ranges vary from 2.2 meters (neap tide) to 8 meters (spring tide);- a first row of locks- behind these locks, wet docks submitted to tide during the period of high tide. In these docks, tidal ranges usually reach 1.5 meters with a maximum of 3.5 meters;- a second row of locks (one of which directly connects the tidal dock to a constant level dock);- constant level docks and canals in the rear port where tidal ranges usually reach 0.4 meters, and occasionally 0.6 meters. The last docks lead, through a canal, ending in a lock, to the river Seine, 20 kin upstream. This canal, known as Tancarville's canal, also receives fresh water from the fiver  Uzarde .Hydrodynamism, inside the port, is generally nil or slight, except in locks, channels and straits where current may be strong, even violent.Salinity decreases from downstream to upstream, but presents, whether at the same location on the same vertical, or according to time, significant variations. The dissolved oxygen contained in the water reaches a peak in April-May. In Summer and in Autumn, distrophy phenomena can be observed locally. Confinement is quite high: the stocking period has been estimated at 144 days in constant level docks.The solid substratum, usually flooded in waters rich in oxygen (quays, wrecks... is the domain of a varied sessile epibenthos, dominated by active suspensivores (sponges, mussels, ascidians), whereas the sediment - generally an anoxic and reducing sludge is the domain of an endofauna poorer in species.The distribution of epibenthos is generally very irregular, which is why we did not count per surface unit: such a method would have led to an illusive impression of accuracy. An appreciation of the method used in making the assessment of the biodiversity through diving has already been presented by BRETON & VINCENT (2002).The main bacterial, botanical and zoological taxa (epibenthos and endobenthos) are listed in paragraphs 3.1 to 3.5 in the French version.The fluvial dock is an ancient wet dock which was completely isolated from adjacent docks by rocks in January 1981. Slight quantities of water rise through rocks and through previously installed pipes. On at least two occasions (1983 and January 2004) a major distrophic, crisis has been observed, including the mortality of benthos, except for mussels, and a colonization of the existing substratum by the opportunistic bristle worm Ficopomatus enigmaticus. Six months later (and particularly in July 2004), Ficopomatus enigmaticus bioconstructions were dismantled and the biodiversity normalized.Through this study, we could note the arrival of foreign species - on average, one species every two years during the last thirty years -most of which have their origin in North East Pacific, such as Hemigrapsus sanguineus, Hemigrapsus penicillatus, Hydroides ezoensis and Undaria pinnatifida.Some species, non native or native, may be invasive; cases concerning Hydroides ezoensis and Didemnum cf. lahillei have been studied.The port of Le Havre is, in this study, considered as a paralic dock sensu GUELORGET & PERTHUISOT (1983,1984) and GUELORGET (1985).The zonation of this paralic domain is classified as follows:- tidal docks (epibenthos): zone II;- tidal docks (epibenthos and endobenthos): zone III;- ancient wet docks (endobenthos): zone III;- constant level docks, in the rear port: zone III in the vicinity of locks; zone IV elsewhere; remote paralic (zone V and VI) only being reached near the mouth of the river  Uzarde ; Fluvial dock: zone IV.A great number of taxa are strictly paralic, for example: Chaetomorpha linum, Enteromorpha intestinalis, Ulva lactuca, Ficopomatus enigmaticus, Hediste diversicolor, Cerastoderma glaucum, Rhitropanopeus harrissii, Balanus amphitrite and Microdeutopus grillotalpa.A complete list of taxa, observed in the docks inside the port of Le Havre from 1992 to 2004, is given with the name of the author in appendix 1.

Ancient analogues are commonly interpreted as lowstand shoreface deposits lying on an erosional surface cut into the shelf during a relative sealevel fall. New observations may challenge this interpretation by providing evidence that such sequences develop during a recent shoreline retreat under highstand conditions without any significant change in sea level.Two examples of such a superimposition are provided by wave-dominated elastic shorefaces in the microtidal environment from the Senegal coast (Saloum delta, Sangomar spit) and in a non-tidal environment on the French Mediterranean coast in the Gulf of Lions.In the Saloum, a littoral cross-section across the Sangomar beach barrier shows a dune sand deposit overlying a man-made shell accumulation, dated 600 BP, and a layer of green muds formed in a lagoon at the back of an ancient beach barrier whose remnants are dated 3150 BP. The retreat of this ancient beach barrier is demonstrated by mapping the former offshore extension of a littoral sand unit which is defined clearly in the region by a grain-size signature. Other observations in the region of the Saloum delta give evidence of the widespread occurrence of coastal recession along the whole Sangomar sedimentary spit.In the Gulf of Lions, vibrocores were used to sample the beach and the shoreface of the Thau lagoon lido. The geological record of recent and present sedimentation exhibits varied littoral sands overlying ancient deposits of fine muddy sand and, at the very bottom of the sections, shoreface sands including fragments of beachrock. Radiocarbon datings give ages of 2050-6700 BP for the underlying muddy fine sand which has been interpreted as a lagoonal deposit enriched in organic matter, typical of lagoon environments in the region. An evolution similar to that proposed for the Sangomar region is supported by additional evidences of a very recent (some centuries) landward displacement of the beach barrier. Lines of wrecks of different ages are observed along this part of the Gulf of Lions, showing that the shoal determined by the offshore bars has migrated successively landwards as the littoral sedimentary prism has receded.

Using the InVEST model, this work quantifies and assesses the value of the carbon balance generated by predictive land-use change (LUC) scenarios for the Northern Coast of Sao Paulo State, Brazil. In this case, carbon losses are explained by the suppression of natural vegetation and human intervention associated to global warming. We analyzed three scenarios: i) the more conservative legal framework; ii) the status quo, which represents the current development level; and iii) the new ventures, encompassing all new infrastructure projects in the region. The carbon losses in the legal framework and status quo scenarios are similar to those of past periods: around 3.7 million MgC in twenty years, pointing to net current values of US$ 47 million. However, carbon losses exceeded 7 million MgC when considering factors linked to the new ventures scenario, such as infrastructure logistics, oil-gas exploration and pressure on natural environments. In this case, monetary losses could amount to US$ 90 million in 20 years.

Our results show that the national public expresses so much interest in Lofoten that they should be considered a legitimate stakeholder in discussions about its future development paths, and while they relate to the area in a broadly similar way, there may be some specific areas of conflict that need to be considered.",,,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,,,1088-937X,1939-0513,,,,,,,,,,"Norsk Inst Nat Forskning, N-2624 Lillehammer, NorwayNorsk Inst Nat Forskning, Trondheim, Norway",Norsk Inst Nat Forskning,,,2019-12-24,WOS:000501873700002,,

Many economic and social issues are geographic in nature; that is, they are associated with the coastal zone-from the coastal plain to the inner shelf. Other issues are related both to geography and to the use of water resources from low river basins to the estuarine plume and are therefore water-dependent. The main economic activities of the region are oil and gas production and petrochemical industries, fisheries, marine transportation, agriculture, cattle ranching, and tourism. More than 80% of economic activities for each of the six Mexican states are located in or associated with the coastal zone. Of the total national gross internal product (GIP, or PIB-the Spanish acronym), the states of the Gulf of Mexico contribute 12.9% of the national total (i.e., Tamaulipas 3.2%, Veracruz 4.5%, Tabasco 1.4%, Campeche 1.2%, Yucatan 1.3%, and Quintana Roo 1.3%). Several socio-economic indicators were selected for specific analysis in order to describe the main economic activities associated with each of the six states (population, income, GIP, fisheries, cattle ranching, port activities, and tourism). The results show the most important economic activities for each of the states are as follows: Tamaulipas (port activities and fisheries), Veracruz (petrochemical industries, port activities, and fisheries), Tabasco (oil and gas production), Campeche (fisheries and oil production), Yucatan (fisheries and tourism), and Quintana Roo (tourism). Some economic activities such as fisheries, agriculture, and cattle ranching, evidenced a decreasing trend during the last decade. This could be related to a decrease of habitat area and water quality in the coastal zone. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

Changes in salt marsh cover in South Africa were described in relation to prevailing pressures. Salt marshes occur in the sheltered estuaries distributed along the similar to 3000 km coastline. Supratidal salt marsh occurs at elevation greater than 1.5 m amsl and are dominant in the cool temperate (5328.28 ha) and intertidal salt marsh in the warm temperate region (2093.31 ha). Although small in total extent (14 955 ha), salt marshes play a central role in biodiversity conservation because they provide critical habitat for migratory fish and birds. Approximately 43% of salt marsh habitat has been lost due to encroaching development and agriculture from the 1930s to 2018. In addition, salinisation and desiccation resulting from upstream freshwater abstraction reduces freshwater inflow, which extends periods of mouth closure in temporarily closed estuaries causing inundation and flooding of salt marsh. Predicting the combined effects of multiple stressors (increase in storm surges, floods, droughts and reduced river flow) is critical to conserve these important habitats. Research and monitoring to understand salt marsh responses is ongoing because the interface between the subtropical and warm temperate coastal regions of South Africa is expected to be affected by mangrove range expansion.

The sediment component of this subsidy is especially important in contributing to the elevation increase of the marsh surface, a process essential for the sustainability of salt marshes during periods of sea level rise. This research tested the hypothesis that sediment subsidies have an ameliorating effect on sea level rise-induced impacts to salt marsh vigor. We assessed the plant structural and soil physico-chemical responses to different intensities of sediment subsidy in a salt marsh experiencing a high rate of relative sea level rise. Sediments were hydraulically dredged with a high fluid to solids ratio (85%:15%) from the Gulf of Mexico and dispersed into a Spartina alterniflora dominated salt marsh. Approximately 2 years after this fluid-sediment-enrichment, maximum sediment elevation did not exceed 30 cm above ambient and both plant cover and aboveground biomass responded positively. Sediment subsidy increased soil mineral matter, and, in turn, soil fertility and marsh elevation, and thereby reduced nutrient deficiency, flooding, and interstitial sulfide stresses. Thus, sediment subsidy generated a more favorable environment for plant growth and potentially, marsh sustainability. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V.

The goal of this study was to assess whether a suite of stream water quality constituents was related to the intensity of UOG development in corresponding catchments. Nineteen streams in southwestern Pennsylvania, where UOG development is prevalent, and 10 streams in western Maryland, where no UOG development has occurred, were sampled in summer 2013. Dissolved metals, radium isotopes, radon, specific conductance, stream discharge, and pH were measured. Principal component analysis revealed that samples tended to cluster by state, but some overlap in water quality existed between Maryland and Pennsylvania. Linear models were used to assess how response variables were related to UOG, other extractive activities, and landscape characteristics. These models showed that an index of oil and gas development had significant explanatory power for specific conductance, As, Ca, K, Mg, Na, and Sr. Other land use and land cover variables, such as forest, urban development, and coal mining, as well as stream discharge and pH, also were significantly associated with response variables.

However, relatively few aspects of these measures have a firm scientific basis or proven efficacy. Existing guidelines do not offer adequate protection to marine mammals, given the complex propagation of airgun pulses; the difficulty of monitoring in particular the smaller, cryptic, and/or deep-diving species, such as beaked whales and porpoises; limitations in monitoring requirements; lack of baseline data; and other biological and acoustical complications or unknowns.

This is in part because flows of ecosystem services remain poorly characterized at local-to-regional scales, and their protection has not generally been made a priority. We used a spatially explicit conservation planning framework to explore the trade-offs and opportunities for aligning conservation goals for biodiversity with six ecosystem services ( carbon storage, flood control, forage production, outdoor recreation, crop pollination, and water provision) in the Central Coast ecoregion of California, United States. We found weak positive and some weak negative associations between the priority areas for biodiversity conservation and the flows of the six ecosystem services across the ecoregion. Excluding the two agriculture-focused services-crop pollination and forage production-eliminates all negative correlations. We compared the degree to which four contrasting conservation network designs protect biodiversity and the flow of the six services. We found that biodiversity conservation protects substantial collateral flows of services. Targeting ecosystem services directly can meet the multiple ecosystem services and biodiversity goals more efficiently but cannot substitute for targeted biodiversity protection ( biodiversity losses of 44% relative to targeting biodiversity alone). Strategically targeting only biodiversity plus the four positively associated services offers much promise ( relative biodiversity losses of 7%). Here we present an initial analytical framework for integrating biodiversity and ecosystem services in conservation planning and illustrate its application.

Constituents of the oil have been reported to cause toxic consequences mediated by aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR), and estrogen receptor (ER). In the present study, AhR and ER mediated toxicities of coastal sediments of Taean were investigated seven years after Hebei Spirit oil spill (HSOS). Sediment samples were collected on June and October 2014 from seven locations along the Taean coastline, where signs of oil spill were detected. Sediment samples were extracted in Soxhlet extractors and further processed through activated silica gels to separate into four fractions; F1 (saturate hydrocarbons), F2 (aromatic hydrocarbons), F3 (resins and polar compounds), and F4 (residues). ER mediated and AhR mediated potencies (% E2(max) and % TCDIDmax) of each fraction were determined using MVLN cells and H4IIE-luc cells, respectively. F2 and F3 fractions of Sinduri 1, Sinduri 2, and Sogeunri 1 samples showed greater AhR mediated potencies (up to 107% TCDDmax). Chemical analysis revealed that PAH components are correlated with AhR binding activities. The % E2max results varied by sample: While there was no noticeable induction of ER-dependent responses (<45%), some aromatics fractions (F2) exhibited the highest ER mediated responses. Compared with previous reports from the same sites, both AhR mediated and ER mediated potencies have decreased over time. Nevertheless, AhR mediated potencies could be identified in the environmental samples even after 7 years of the incident. Therefore, possible ecosystem implications of these findings should be further investigated. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Any inadequate on-bottom stability design could result in disruption and failure, having a devastating impact on the economy and environment. Predicting the stability behavior of offshore pipelines in hurricanes is therefore vital to the assessment of both new design and existing assets. The Gulf of Mexico has a very dense network of pipeline systems constructed on the seabed. During the last two decades, the Gulf of Mexico has experienced a series of strong hurricanes, which have destroyed, disrupted and destabilized many pipelines. This paper first reviews some of these engineering cases. Following that, three case studies are retrospectively simulated using an in-house developed program. The study utilizes the offshore pipeline and hurricane details to conduct a Dynamic Lateral Stability analysis, with the results providing evidence as to the accuracy of the modeling techniques developed.

The system is composed of a blade submerged in sea waters and connected to a vertical bar which, moving up and down through the tide action, transfers energy to a double effect piston pump. The latter feeds a pressurized reservoir able to provide water flow rate, at a suitable pressure level, to a hydraulic turbine. The basic configuration involves a four-bar linkage connecting the vertical bar and the piston pump. The system can be easily employed in all those sites whose seabed quickly deepens and whose tidal currents are parallel to the coast. The proposed system is a valid alternative to the current tidal energy converters: its big dimensions are necessary to balance the low efficiencies of the overall energy conversion. At any rate, during the working the seabed is not altered, neither is the aquatic fauna damaged. (C) 2017 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Here, we explored the consequences of C&R on adult permit (Trachinotus falcatus), including assessments of depredation rates, their physiological and reflex responses prior to release, post-release behaviour, and post-release predation in diverse habitats in the Florida Keys, USA. We found pre-capture depredation rates were highly variable amongst habitat types, ranging from zero on shallow water flats, to 35.3% and 90.1% on specific reef and shipwreck locations, respectively. Observed predators were all large sharks. Importantly, one of the high predation sites is an important permit spawning location, thus C&R fishing in that locale may be a conservation concern. Physiological stress responses (blood lactate, glucose, pH) and reflex tests indicated that permit were relatively robust to routine angling (fight durations of 1 to 12 min) and handling (air exposure up to 2 min). Short duration post-release tracking using tri-axial acceleration biologgers identified no differences in swimming activity for fish that were kept in water versus those held in the air for 2 min to simulate an admiration period. While this study indicates that permit are relatively robust to C&R angling in terms of stress responses and behavioural impairment, high densities of opportunistic predators at certain fishing locations can result in high rates of pre-capture depredation independent of the state of the animal. Permit angling in locations with high predator densities is a potential conservation issue, especially if specific locations represent important pre-spawning aggregation sites for fish populations that may be more vulnerable to predation and thus depredation. Current C&R best practices (i.e., limiting fight times and air exposure) may not be adequate to ensure permit survival at high predator density sites. Angling-related depredation is often cryptic, yet is a growing conservation concern in many fisheries - we developed and applied a novel framework for identifying cryptic depredation that may be applicable across fisheries.",,,,,,,,,27,0,0,0,21,0,28,,,0022-0981,1879-1697,,,,,,,,,,"Carleton Univ, Dept Biol, Fish Ecol & Conservat Physiol Lab, Ottawa, ON K1S 5B6, CanadaCarleton Univ, Inst Environm & Interdisciplinary Sci, Ottawa, ON K1S 5B6, CanadaUniv Massachusetts, Dept Environm Conservat, 160 Holdsworth Way, Amherst, MA 01003 USABonefish & Tarpon Trust, 135 San Lorenzo Ave,Suite 860, Coral Gables, FL 33146 USADalhousie Univ, Dept Biol, 1355 Oxford St, Halifax, NS B4H 4R2, Canada",Bonefish & Tarpon Trust,,,2020-03-03,WOS:000514018900005,,

Extensive wildfire reduced the number of sites to 28 (seven in each of four age classes) upon which analyses and inferences were made. We also analysed data on carbon storage and some bird responses from previously published studies.ResultsMature vegetation (> 100 years) had the greatest richness, abundance and biomass of birds. Key ecological resources, such as tree-hollows for nesting, generally occurred mostly in stands > 60 years. Avian richness per unit of above-ground carbon storage was relatively low for stands of 20-60 years. While above-ground carbon storage appeared to increase in a monotonic fashion as stands age and mature, there were quantum increases in all measures of avian biodiversity in mature stands (> 100 years).Main conclusionsOur results suggest that carbon is organized in a different way, with substantially greater biodiversity benefits, in very old stands. Mature vegetation simultaneously maximizes both avian biodiversity and above-ground carbon storage. These results bolster arguments for allocating highest priorities to the preservation of old-growth forest stands rather than alternative investments (e.g. reafforestation for carbon sequestration).",,,,,,,,,28,2,0,0,21,0,31,,,1466-822X,1466-8238,,,,,,,,,,"Monash Univ, Sch Appl Sci & Engn, Churchill, Vic 3842, AustraliaArthur Rylah Inst Environm Res, Dept Sustainabil & Environm, Heidelberg, Vic, Australia",,,,2011-03-23,WOS:000286889500006,,

The Lagos lagoon (Nigeria) is one of Africa's largest estuarine ecosystems, and is impacted by hydrocarbon pollutants and other industrial and municipal wastes. The goal of this study was to elucidate microbial community structure in Lagos lagoon sediments to identify groups that may be adversely affected by pollution, and those that may serve as degraders of environmental contaminants, especially polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). Sediment samples were collected from sites that ranged in types and levels of anthropogenic impacts. The sediments were characterized for a range of physicochemical properties, and microbial community structure was determined by Illumina sequencing of the 16S rRNA genes. Microbial diversity (species richness and evenness) in the Apapa and Eledu sediments was reduced compared to that of the Ofin site, and communities of both of the former two were dominated by a single operational taxonomic unit (OTU) assigned to the family Helicobacteraceae (Epsilonproteobacteria). In the [fin community, Epsilonproteobacteria were minor constituents, while the major groups were Cyanobacteria. Bacteroidetes, and Firmicutes, which were all minor in the Apapa and Eledu sediments. Sediment oxygen demand (SOD), abroad indicator of contamination, was identified by multivariate analyses as strongly correlated with variation in alpha diversity. Environmental variables that explained beta diversity patterns included SOD, as well as levels of naphthalene, acenaphthylene, cobalt, cadmium, total organic matter, or nitrate. Of 582 OTU identified, abundance of 167 was significantly correlated (false discovery rate q <= 0.05) to environmental variables. The largest group of OTU correlated with PAH levels were RAH/hydrocarbon-degrading genera of the Oceanospirillales order (Gammaproteobacteria), which were most abundant in the hydrocarbon-contaminated Apapa sediment. Similar Oceanospirillales taxa are responsive to marine oil spills and thus may present a unifying theme in marine microbiology as bacteria adapted for degradation of high hydrocarbon loads, and may represent a potential means for intrinsic remediation in the case of the Lagos lagoon sediments.",,,,,,,,,49,4,0,0,36,0,53,,,,1664-302X,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Lagos, Dept Microbiol, Lagos, NigeriaUniv Wisconsin, Dept Soil Sci, ON Allen Lab Soil Microbiol, Madison, WI 53706 USA",,,,2016-09-13,WOS:000380787300001,27547200,

The long-term acquisition of information on offshore oil production is essential to solve geo-political conflicts and to control marine pollution. However, such information is either dispersed among different authorities or may not even exist. Night-Time Lights (NTL) data has advantages in terms of synoptic coverage and repeatability, providing the opportunity to collect information about marine resources and energy. Until recently, estimating offshore oil production using NTL data was still challenging, largely due to the inability of distinguishing the NTL of oil and gas production. Here, we present an approach for retrieving the spatio-temporal distribution of offshore oil production using DMSP-OLS annual composites. Starting with the geo-locations of offshore platforms, we first propose a Method for Platform Type Classification (MPTC) to discriminate oil platforms from gas platforms. A Model for Oil Production Estimation and Assignment (MOPEA) was then designed by correlating the sum of brightness from oil platforms with offshore oil production. Given worldwide data availability, the offshore regions of the United Kingdom (UK) were used as the initial study area. The principal results are as follows: (i) the overall accuracy of the MPTC and the relative error of the MOPEA were 87.8% and 11.5%, respectively, and the production of each oilfield was in order of magnitude agreement with reality; (ii) there were 365 oil platforms and 258 gas platforms in the UK during 1992-2013, with a distinct spatial distribution north and south of the latitude of 55 degrees N; and (iii) the offshore oil production of the UK declined substantially during 1992-2013, from 9.92 x 10(7) to 5.63 x 10(7) sm(3), despite an increase in the number of oilfields from 39 to 120 plots; this was mainly because the loss of production in previously highly productive oilfields was too great to be offset by the increased number of low production oilfields. The regional transferability of the MPTC and MOPEA was then validated with reference to three other offshore regions (the Gulf of Guinea of Nigeria, the South China Sea, and the northern Gulf of Mexico of the USA) with satisfactory results. In addition, the MPTC and MOPEA are demonstrated to be capable of extension to the NPP-VIIRS products, paving the way for future applications.",,,,,,,,,5,0,0,0,0,0,5,,,0924-2716,1872-8235,,,,,,,,,,"Ningbo Univ, Dept Geog & Spatial Informat Tech, Ningbo, Zhejiang, Peoples R ChinaNingbo Univ, Inst East China Sea, Ningbo, Zhejiang, Peoples R ChinaNanjing Univ, Sch Geog & Ocean Sci, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R ChinaNanjing Univ, Collaborat Innovat Ctr South China Sea Studies, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R ChinaNingbo Inst Surveying & Mapping, Ningbo, Zhejiang, Peoples R China",Ningbo Inst Surveying & Mapping,,,2020-06-30,WOS:000540373500013,,

Some major adverse effects include harmful algal blooms, hypoxia of fresh and coastal waters, ocean acidification, long-term harm to human health, and increased emissions of greenhouse gases. Nitrogen fluxes to coastal areas and emissions of nitrous oxide from waters have increased in response to N inputs. Denitrification and sedimentation of organic N to sediments are important processes that divert N from downstream transport. Aquatic ecosystems are particularly important denitrification hotspots. Carbon storage in sediments is enhanced by Nr, but whether carbon is permanently buried is unknown. The effect of climate change on N transport and processing in fresh and coastal waters will be felt most strongly through changes to the hydrologic cycle, whereas N loading is mostly climate-independent. Alterations in precipitation amount and dynamics will alter runoff, thereby influencing both rates of Nr inputs to aquatic ecosystems and groundwater and the water residence times that affect Nr removal within aquatic systems. Both infrastructure and climate change alter the landscape connectivity and hydrologic residence time that are essential to denitrification.

The timing and rate of this phase-out will depend on the stringency of near-term climate policy and will have important implications for the stranding of coal power plant capacity without CCS. The objectives of this paper are to better understand the relationship between near-term climate policy and stranded coal capacity (assuming a long-term goal of limiting warming to 2 degrees C) and to explore strategies for reducing stranded capacity. Our analysis suggests that strengthening near-term climate policy (i.e., lowering the global greenhouse gas emission target in 2030) generally reduces stranded coal capacity and its costs. An effective strategy for reducing stranded capacity is to minimize new construction of coal capacity without CCS, which can be accomplished by reducing electricity demand through energy intensity improvements and/or by keeping existing plants operating through lifetime extensions. Another strategy, providing emission exemptions for pre-existing coal plants (i.e., grandfathering), would eliminate stranded capacity, but also decreases the likelihood of achieving the 2 degrees C target. Finally, the ability of CCS retrofits to significantly reduce stranded capacity depends on how quickly the technology can be deployed. (C) 2014 The Authors.

To examine relationships between the temporal variability in shoreline/sandbar position with offshore wave forcing, a simple equilibrium model is applied to these data. The analysis presented in this paper shows that the equilibrium model is skilled at predicting the alongshore-averaged, time-varying position of the shoreline (R = 0.82) and the outer sandbar position (R = 0.75), suggesting that these end members of the nearshore sediment system are most strongly influenced by offshore wave forcing in a predictable, equilibrium-forced manner. The middle and inner bars are hypothesized to act as sediment transport pathways between the shoreline and the outer bar. Prediction of these more transient features by an equilibrium model was less skilful.Model coefficients reveal that these two end members (outer bar and shoreline) in the sediment system act in opposite directions to changes in the annual offshore wave forcing. During high wave events, sediment is removed from the shoreline and deposited in the nearshore sediment system with simultaneous landward retreat of the shoreline and offshore migration of the outer sandbar. While both end member features have cycles at annual and inter-annual scales, their respective equilibrium response factor differs by almost a factor of 10, with the shoreline responding around an inter-annual mean (phi = 1000 days) and the outer bar responding around a seasonal mean (phi = 170 days). The model accurately predicts shoreline response to both mild (e.g. 2004/05, 2008/09) and extreme (e.g. 2005/06, 2009/10) winter storms, as well as their summer recovery. The more mobile and dynamic outer sandbar is well-modelled during typical winters. Summer onshore sandbar migration of the outer bar in 2005 and 2006 is under-predicted as the system transitioned between a triple (winter) and double (summer) sandbar system. The changing of the number of bars present in the system is something that this simple model cannot predict. Analysis of the data suggests that this multi-bar system adjusts its cross-shore seasonal movement when there is a significant change in the sediment supply to the system (e.g., nourishment projects, severe storms).",,,,,,,,,20,0,0,0,3,0,20,,,0278-4343,1873-6955,,,,,,,,,,"UNSW Sydney, Water Res Lab, Sch Civil & Environm Engn, Sydney, NSW, AustraliaUniv Estado Rio de Janeiro, Fac Engn, Rua Sao Francisco Xavier 524, Rio De Janeiro, RJ, BrazilNorthWest Res Associates, Redmond, WA USAUniv Utrecht, Postbus 80-015, NL-3508 TA Utrecht, NetherlandsOregon State Univ, Coll Earth Ocean & Atmospher Sci, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA",,,,2018-05-08,WOS:000430889600004,,

We tested the hypotheses that the spill decreased mean periwinkle density, reduced mean snail shell length, and changed periwinkle size distribution. Averaged across multiple studies, sites, marsh zones (edge versus interior), and years, our synthesis revealed a negative effect of heavy oiling on periwinkles. Snail densities were reduced by 73% in heavily oiled sites across all study-zone-by-year combinations, including adverse effects for both the oiled marsh edge and oiled marsh interior, with impacts observed over more than 5 yr. Mean periwinkle shell length was somewhat reduced at the oiled marsh edge in a few cases; however, periwinkle size distributions displayed greater relative proportions of smaller adults and sub-adults, and fewer large adults, across all years. Given the spatial and temporal extent of data analyzed, this synthesis provides evidence that the Deepwater Horizon spill suppressed populations of marsh periwinkles in heavily oiled marshes for over 5 yr, and that impacts were ongoing and recovery was incomplete, likely affecting other ecosystem components, including marsh productivity, organic matter and nutrient cycling, marsh-estuarine food webs, and associated predators.",,,,,,,,,17,0,0,0,16,0,18,,,0171-8630,1616-1599,,,,,,,,,,"RPI, Tallahassee, FL 32303 USARPI, Columbia, SC 29201 USAUniv Houston, Dept Biol & Biochem, Houston, TX 77204 USADuke Univ, Marine Lab, Beaufort, NC 28516 USAAtkins, Jacksonville, FL 32256 USAUniv Florida, Dept Environm Engn Sci, Gainesville, FL 32611 USANOAA, Emergency Response Div, Off Response & Restorat, Natl Ocean Serv, Seattle, WA 98115 USAUniv Florida, Dept Geol Sci, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA",RPIRPIAtkins,,,2017-09-12,WOS:000407443900011,,

Management guidelines within the National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska dictate buffer zones for coastal wildlife habitat and for breeding and foraging sites of yellow-billed loons (YBLOs; Gavia adamsii), a species of conservation concern. However, few data exist to assess the value of these buffer zones for YBLOs or for sympatrically breeding red-throated loons (RTLOs; G. stellata) and Pacific loons (PALOs; G. pacifica). We evaluated movements of these loons on the Arctic Coastal Plain to understand: 1) seasonal timing; 2) marine habitat use; and 3) spatial characteristics of breeding home ranges. We then used those findings to evaluate current management strategies in the context of loon biology. Compared to RTLOs and PALOs, YBLOs nested on larger lakes, stayed on them longer, had larger home ranges, but less frequently used the marine environment in summer. During autumn, YBLOs and PALOs were located farther from shore than during spring or summer, whereas RTLOs used the marine environment similarly during all three seasons. Management buffers established for YBLO nesting areas corresponded well with nest site space use of all three species, suggesting cross-taxa applicability of current management guidelines for nesting habitat. However, the majority of loon locations on the Arctic Coastal Plain were outside of coastal buffer zones established to protect fish and wildlife habitat within the National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska. These findings can inform assessment of conservation buffer zones to mitigate anthropogenic disturbance to loons in Alaska.

Moreover, there is a lack of coordination and cooperation between the concerned governmental institutions that might be due to the confusions over their respective responsibilities. These institutions are under-employed and lack the capacity building to perform their responsibilities effectively and efficiently. Furthermore, there is a limited participation of the local community in the decision making process of petroleum development in Sudan.

Geologic mapping and high-resolution stratigraphic study of a set of Miocene outcrops, exceptional for their three-dimensional exposure and preservation of paleotopography, demonstrates that paleotopographic focus (or lack thereof) may be a dominant control on geometries and sediment character of sediment-gravity-flow deposits in line-sourced systems.In the Agua Amarga basin, SE Spain, basin topography is initially modified by subaerial exposure and erosion of volcanic basement to form paleovalley systems. After late Miocene marine inundation, topography is partially modified by infilling of high-energy, shallow-water heterozoan deposits (Units 1 and 2) that subdued topography in one area to produce a ramp-like surface, but did not significantly infill a large paleovalley located in another area. Further relative rise in sea level resulted in an extensive reefal platform that formed along a paleo-high adjacent to both features (La Rellana platform). Subsequent sediment-gravity-flow deposits shed from this reefal platform followed two pathways: down the ramp-like surface (dispersed flow), or into the large flooded paleovalley (focused flow). Deposits within each system display contrasting lithofacies architectures. These deepwater deposits (Units 3-7 in this study) consist of carbonate breccia facies (coarse facies), graded skeletal packstone facies (coarse facies), and planktonic foraminifera-rich facies (fine facies) that are interpreted as sediment-gravity-flow deposits and pelagic sediments.Relative sea-level fluctuations resulted in deepwater facies variations in the large paleovalley as a result of significant backstepping and progradation of the Rellana reefal platform on a gently sloping surface. Fining of basinal deposits and shelfward migration of the locus of deposition for sediment gravity flows is associated with sea-level rise. Coarsening of basinal deposits and basinward migration of the locus of deposition for sediment gravity flows is associated with stillstand and relative fall in sea level. Both relationships demonstrate a direct link between the locus of reefal platform growth and style of basin sedimentation. Early parts of relative rises in sea level, late parts of highstands, and falling stages led to transport of abundant coarse sediment into the basin.Focused-flow deposits were line-sourced and funneled into the axis of a large, margin-parallel paleovalley, and confined to a channel. Volume ratio of coarse facies to fine facies is estimated at 0.7. Deposits in proximal paleovalley locations display compensation geometries around positive relief on debrites, channelization, erosional truncation, lapout against paleovalley walls, and some drape as a result of lateral confinement and proximity to the sediment source. Deposits in distal paleovalley locations display increasingly tabular geometries as a result of decreasing lateral confinement and concentration of coarse-grained sediment gravity flows down depositional dip.Dispersed-flow deposits were line-sourced into the basin along a gently inclined ramp-like surface that lacked paleotopographic focus. Volume ratio of coarse facies to fine facies is estimated at 0.1. The less complex sheet-like depositional geometries and locations of these deposits result from the absence of lateral confinement and subtle changes in substrate slope.Focused-flow sediment-gravity-flow deposits that are confined by topographic elements such as channels are most likely to form sizeable accumulations of coarse facies with characteristics most appropriate for conventional oil and gas exploration. There are many paleotopographic configurations that can lead to focusing of flows, so this deepwater carbonate system may be more common than previously recognized.",,,,,,,,,8,0,0,0,0,0,8,,,1527-1404,,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Kansas, Dept Geol, Kansas Interdisciplinary Carbonates Consortium, Lawrence, KS 66045 USA",,,,2012-11-07,WOS:000309326300005,,

The first ROC room was commissioned in 2019 and the ROC is fully functional. This enables people to be removed from the offshore environment and sited in the dedicated Aberdeen ROC without compromising on quality of service. It also facilitates fully autonomous operations.Many projects in the UK energy sector have been postponed due to the COVID-19 restrictions. Other projects are proceeding, but with major implications. These implications include:* personnel being unable to mobilise or return home* 7-day pre and post mobilisation quarantines* Increased project costs* Inability of UK personnel to travel and losing workUsing Fugro's ROC in Aberdeen brings many benefits to the UK economy, including:Wellbeing* Exportable technology and processes* Allowing operations to be carried-out anywhere in the world from Aberdeen* Improving diversity (no need for offshore medicals etc)* Supporting world leading technology* Supporting the UK commitment to Climate Change Act 2008 and Maritime 2050Using remote Fugro services enables removal of all Fugro & 3rd party personnel from an offshore Vessel and relocated into the ROC for specific operations. Other operations provide reductions of PoB (Personnel on Board) by between 29% and 75%.

In this research paper, a detailed quantitative survey and qualitative risk assessments (RA) have been carried out for assessing the potentially hazardous activities associated with well control along with their appropriate controls and risk reduction factors and mitigating measures in Middle East and south East Asian countries. Design/methodology/approach The sequential explanatory research design has been adopted in this study. Whereas, descriptive statistical approach has been used for the quantitative data analysis of this study. While, in-depth interview approach has been used for qualitative data collection. Similarly, what-if analysis method has been adopted in this study for the identification of effective safety and health risk mitigating factors because it provides in-depth information from health and safety environment experts. Findings The cumulative quantitative results based on the response from Saudi Arabian drilling industry have indicated that the well control operation is highly hazardous then Malaysian and Pakistani oil and gas industries. Likewise, findings from what-if analysis approach demonstrate that the drilling crewmembers have repetitively faced life threatening hazards which occur (safety and chemical) during well control onshore and offshore operation because of oil base mud, confined space at site, pinch points and falling during working on blow out preventers.

Given that this variability drives changes in ecologically and economically important living marine resources, predictive skill for regional oceanographic conditions is highly desirable. Here, we assess the skill of seasonal sea surface temperature (SST) forecasts in the CCS using output from Global Climate Forecast Systems in the North American Multi-Model Ensemble (NMME), and describe mechanisms that underlie SST predictability. A simple persistence forecast provides considerable skill for lead times up to similar to 4 months, while skill above persistence is mostly confined to forecasts of late winter/spring and derives primarily from predictable evolution of ENSO-related variability. Specifically, anomalously weak (strong) equatorward winds are skillfully forecast during El Nino (La Nina) events, and drive negative (positive) upwelling anomalies and consequently warm (cold) temperature anomalies. This mechanism prevails during moderate to strong ENSO events, while years of ENSO-neutral conditions are not associated with significant forecast skill in the wind or significant skill above persistence in SST. We find also a strong latitudinal gradient in predictability within the CCS; SST forecast skill is highest off the Washington/Oregon coast and lowest off southern California, consistent with variable wind forcing being the dominant driver of SST predictability.

Here we review the life cycle of O&G fields in the MRD focusing on the production history and resulting environmental impacts and show how cumulative impacts affect coastal ecosystems. Individual fields can last 40-60 years and most wells are in the final stages of production. Production increased rapidly reaching a peak around 1970 and then declined. Produced water lagged O&G and was generally higher during declining O&G production, making up about 70% of total liquids. Much of the wetland loss in the delta is associated with O&G activities. These have contributed in three major ways to wetland loss including alteration of surface hydrology, induced subsidence due to fluids removal and fault activation, and toxic stress due to spilled oil and produced water. Changes in surface hydrology are related to canal dredging and spoil placement. As canal density increases, the density of natural channels decreases. Interconnected canal networks often lead to saltwater intrusion. Spoil banks block natural overland flow affecting exchange of water, sediments, chemicals, and organisms. Lower wetland productivity and reduced sediment input leads to enhanced surficial subsidence. Spoil banks are not permanent but subside and compact over time and many spoil banks no longer have subaerial expression. Fluid withdrawal from O&G formations leads to induced subsidence and fault activation. Formation pore pressure decreases, which lowers the lateral confining stress acting in the formation due to poroelastic coupling between pore pressure and stress. This promotes normal faulting in an extensional geological environment like the MRD, which causes surface subsidence in the vicinity of the faults. Induced reservoir compaction results in a reduction of reservoir thickness. Induced subsidence occurs in two phases especially when production rate is high. The first phase is compaction of the reservoir itself while the second phase is caused by a slow drainage of pore pressure in bounding shales that induces time-delayed subsidence associated with shale compaction. This second phase can continue for decades, even after most O&G has been produced, resulting in subsidence over much of an oil field that can be greater than surface subsidence due to altered hydrology. Produced water is water brought to the surface during O&G extraction and an estimated 2 million barrels per day were discharged into Louisiana coastal wetlands and waters from nearly 700 sites. This water is a mixture of either liquid or gaseous hydrocarbons, high salinity (up to 300 ppt) water, dissolved and suspended solids such as sand or silt, and injected fluids and additives associated with exploration and production activities and it is toxic to many estuarine organisms including vegetation and fauna. Spilled oil has lethal and sub-lethal effects on a wide range of estuarine organisms. The cumulative effect of alterations in surface hydrology, induced subsidence, and toxins interact such that overall impacts are enhanced. Restoration of coastal wetlands degraded by O&G activities should be informed by these impacts.",,,,,,,,,22,0,0,0,9,0,26,,,,2073-4441,,,,,,,,,,"Louisiana State Univ, Dept Oceanog & Coastal Sci, Baton Rouge, LA 70803 USARice Univ, Dept Earth Environm & Planetary Sci, Houston, TX 77005 USAChungnam Natl Univ, Dept Geol Sci, Daejeon 34134, South KoreaCom Resources Inc, POB 66596, Baton Rouge, LA 70896 USACharles Norman & Associates, POB 5715, Lake Charles, LA 70606 USA",Com Resources IncCharles Norman & Associates,,,2020-08-19,WOS:000555915200271,,

The PPI program has sampled the shallow nearshore fish community at 5 sites along the coast of southern California since 1972, while CalCOFI has sampled fish larvae along 6 transects at standard stations ranging from 35 m depth to more than 500 km offshore since 1951. Recently published analyses of these data sets led us to examine potential relationships between them. Although there was limited overlap in the taxa sampled by the 2 programs, key multivariate patterns were highly correlated between them. Both time series exhibited dramatic declines from the 1970s to the 2000s: 78% for fishes entrapped by the power plants and 72% for the overall abundance of larval fishes in the CalCOFI time series. These trends, which predominantly affected taxa with cool-water affinities, were shared by fishes across nearshore and oceanic habitats, and included several trophic guilds and many unfished or only lightly fished taxa. These declines were significantly correlated with declining zooplankton displacement volumes across the California Current System (CCS), which suggests the influence of large-scale climatic and oceanographic drivers.

Its mangrove forest is the largest in Africa and the Atlantic. This ecosystem provides firewood, building materials, medicinal herbs and food for the local population. But oil and gas exploration, deforestation, dredging, urbanization and invasive species over the years had converted it from a pristine to a disturbed state. The greatest damage to mangroves in the Niger Delta comes from oil and gas exploration activities, which began in 1956 in Oloibiri. Millions of crude oil spillages had occurred, since the striking of the first oil well from ruptured well heads, pipelines, and jetties, constructed on both onshore and offshore locations. This degraded condition had reduced the mangrove forest from highly dense to lowly dense and also to mixed forest. Exploratory activities had also resulted to additional problems, such as invasion by alien species and urbanization of mangrove areas. Urbanization is beneficial to man's development, but costly for the mangroves. The establishment of industrial and residential quarters to accommodate oil workers and their families had increased the urban sprawl around mangrove forest areas. These activities had reduced the resilience of mangroves against the invasion of nypa palm (Nypa fruticans). The palms were intentionally introduced into the Niger Delta in 1906, but for close to a century the mangroves had kept them in check.

The results indicate it may be one of few examples in the region that has not yet suffered the same level of anthropogenic or natural disturbances that other areas in the region have suffered. Anthropogenic impacts are low as a result of its remote location that has kept it relatively isolated from markets. Limited evidence of bleaching mortality indicates that the area may have some resilience to bleaching events. Given its condition and strategic location, we suggest the area is of high conservation and research interest, and is an important economic resource that if managed wisely can contribute to sustainable fisheries and development through tourism.

Ecological models of forest dynamics have the potential to provide a structure through which data, observations and assumptions can be combined and explored. The utility of such models, however, is often limited by lack of validation. In this paper we used growth data for 143,200 tree measurements, in 121 plots spanning up to 70 years of forest monitoring from uneven-aged mixed species callitris forests of Australia to test the Ecosystem Dynamics Simulator (EDS). These are among the least known and most degraded forest communities in Australia and are known habitat for threatened and rare fauna species including brush-tailed rock wallaby (Petrogale penicillata), glossy black-cockatoo (Calyptorhynchus lathami), grey falcon (Falco hypoleucos), golden-tailed gecko (Strophurus taenicauda) and others. We determined growth parameters for 26 woody species and applied these to the EDS to validate projected stand structure and growth. The model projections explained 93.9% (diameter at breast height (dbh)), 88.9% (basal area), 90.5% (stem density) and 88.6% (aboveground biomass) of the observed variation. To our knowledge, this is one of the most accurate validations of forest dynamics simulation achieved to date. Diameter growth rates for most species were <0.3 cm yr(-1) and reproduced well by the EDS, for all the species in the callitris forest communities. These growth rates indicate that exceptionally long periods will be required to restore the degraded or cleared forests to a mature state. Results can guide restoration and sustainable management of callitris forest ecosystems by providing projected measurable forest attributes to meet multiple goals, including harvesting of forest resources, carbon storage and conservation of biodiversity.

Organic matter is not produced at a constant rate in such systems; rather, it is generated in pulses by a halotolerant community in response to relatively short times of less stressful conditions (brackish to mesohaline) that occur in the upper part of the layered hydrology. Accumulations of organic matter can occur in any layered brine lake or epeiric seaway when an upper less-saline water mass forms on top of nutrient-rich brines, or in wet mudflats wherever waters freshen in and above the uppermost few millimetres of a microbial mat. A flourishing community of halotolerant algae, bacteria and archaeal photosynthesizers drives the resulting biomass bloom. Brine freshening is a time of feast characterized by very high levels of organic productivity. In a stratified brine column (oligotrophic and meromictic) the typical producers are planktonic algal or cyanobacterial communities inhabiting the upper mesohaline portion of the stratified water mass. In mesohaline holomictic waters, where light penetrates to the water bottom, the organic-producing layer is typically the upper algal and bacterial portion of a benthic laminated microbialite characterized by elevated numbers of cyanobacteria.Short pulses of extremely high productivity in the upper freshened part of a stratified brine column create a high volume of organic detritus settling through the column and/or the enhanced construction of benthic microbial mats in regions where freshened waters reach the hypersaline base of the column. With the end of the freshening event, ongoing intensely arid conditions mean that salinity, temperature and osmotic stress increase rapidly in the previously freshened water mass. This leads to a time of mass die-off of the once flourishing mesohaline community (famine). First, these increasingly salty waters no longer support haloxene forms. Then, halotolerant life dies back, and finally by the halite precipitation stage, only a few halophilic archaea and bacteria remain in the brine column (typically acting as heterotrophs and fermenters). Repeated pulses of organic matter, created during a feasting event followed by a famine event, create laminated organic-enriched sediment on an anoxic bottom.There are three, possibly four, major mesohaline density-stratified settings where organic-rich laminites (petroleum source rocks) accumulated in ancient famine or feast saline settings: (1) basin-centre lows in marine-fed evaporitic drawdown basins, associated with basinwide evaporites; (2) mesohaline intra-shelf lows on epeiric platforms, associated with platform evaporites; (3) saline-bottomed lows in under-filled perennial saline lacustrine basins; (4) closed seafloor depressions in halokinetic deep-water marine slope and rise terrains. An inherently restrictive hydrology means that the same mesohaline settings show a propensity to evolve into regions characterized by the accumulation of widespread evaporite salts. If this happens soon after deposition of a layer of organic-rich sediment there is an increased likelihood of evaporite plugging in the source-rock layer, this in-turn decreases expulsion efficiency and downgrades the laminite bed's ability to act as a prolific source rock.",,,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,,,0141-3600,,978-1-4443-3910-9,,,,,,,,,"Chulalongkorn Univ, Fac Sci, Dept Geol, Int Master Program Petr Geosci, Bangkok 10330, ThailandSultan Qaboos Univ, Oil & Gas Res Ctr, Muscat, Oman",,,,2011-01-01,WOS:000290346600017,,

Understanding these relationships helps to identify how to mitigate the effects. Moreover, understanding where cumulative effects are likely to occur helps in characterizing the environmental and planning assessment to help managers decide how best to regulate certain activities.We developed a series of PoE models as part of a pilot project for the Yukon North Slope in the Beaufort Sea to determine what activities might have a potentially negative effect on valued or vulnerable components of the ecosystem. Part of the purpose of this pilot was to see how these models worked in real life and to determine if PoE might be a useful tool which could be used to help manage some activities in the Beaufort Sea.Assessment of the models we created suggests that the largest potential threats to the Yukon North Slope may come from oil and gas development (both exploration and exploitation). Transportation, especially if it does increase due to more use of the Northwest Passage or increased tourism, brings with it other possible risks. Additional activities we examined were found to have far fewer risks associated with them. Ultimately, however, even high risk activities can be permitted if enough care is taken in their planning and execution.This pilot study showed the usefulness of the Pathways of Effects method to display the potential threats from proposed activities and therefore could be used as a valuable tool to assist marine planning by industry, stakeholders, managers and co-managers. It also shows how Pathways of Effects can be the basis of an essential analysis role as a precursor for risk assessment.

Significant effects on specific growth rate (SGR) were seen in fish exposed to 200 ppm Sea Rose PW (P< 0.05) and 100 ppm Thebaud PW (P< 0.005) but there was no observed dose response. The results suggest that intermittent exposure to environmentally relevant concentrations of PW from some oil and gas platforms can affect growth.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,0706-6457,,,,,,,,,,,"Fisheries & Oceans Canada, St Andrews Biol Stn, 531 Brandy Cove Rd, St Andrews, NB, E5B 2L9, Canada",,,,2014-01-01,ZOOREC:ZOOR15312075517,,

Although international oil companies oppose an onshore-only requirement, its rejection is no longer a high priority for them. The ascendancy of onshore-only disposition reflects a rational and predictable response to political attitudes, values, and expectations in Western Europe by both governmental policy makers and petroleum industry strategists. Repercussions from the fight over the disposition of the obsolete Brent Spar offshore oil storage and transfer facility are the proximate cause of the shift. Onshore disposition has been least expensive option for most platforms, but as platforms move further from shore toward deeper waters onshore disposition is more frequently inferior to other disposition alternatives - from both an environmental and economic point of view. If onshore-only disposition were to become an international standard, either de facto or de jure, some offshore producing areas would incur significantly higher disposition costs and lose opportunities to better utilize and protect their marine resources.

New oil fields, mostly located in extreme conditions, are posing serious challenges to both human and environment in terms of safety. Tasks which are repeated, dirty, and dangerous and require high degree of accuracy are already automatized in manufacturing industry. This success has inspired oil and gas industry to lend some of its highly dangerous and repetitive tasks for automation. Most of the processes are remotely operated, and require highly skilled operator. Such processes benefits not only in terms of overall health and safety, by removing humans from hazardous environment, but also by reduction of number staff members required for continuous inspection and manipulation of plant facilities. Considering the sensitivity of inflammable products involved in this industry usage of completely autonomous robots is still a far fetch choice. Therefore, semi-autonomous robots are excellent choice for this industry at-least as near future solution. In oil and gas industry, robots are used both in upstream and downstream process such as pipe handling in drilling operations, pipe inspection, tank inspection, and remote controlled underwater vehicles (ROVs).

Potential impacts of the precipitation of heavy metals on their transport and toxicity were studied using samples from offshore oil production sites on the Scotian Shelf off eastern Canada. Concentrations of aluminum, cadmium, chromium, cobalt, copper, iron, lead, manganese, nickel and zinc were measured in total, particulate and dissolved fractions together with Microtox((R)) tests for assessment of toxicity.Heavy metals in produced water were transformed from dissolved to particulate phase in a period of hours under oxygenated conditions, and aggregated to larger particles that settle rapidly (> 100 m/ day) over a few days. In addition, there was production of buoyant particles comprised of heavy metal precipitates sequestered onto oil droplets that were transported to the surface.The particulate fraction was generally more toxic than the dissolved fraction. This was evident at the mixing interface between produced water and seawater where elevated particulate and toxicity levels were observed. Laboratory studies suggest an increase in the toxicity of discharged produced water over time. Time-series experiments showed a sustained toxic response for more than a week following the oxidation of freshly discharged produced water that initially elicited little or no toxic response in the Microtox((R)) test.Chemical processes identified in this study, namely precipitation of heavy metals and consequent settling and rising fluxes of particles, will influence the toxicity, the fate and the transport of potential contaminants in the produced water. Therefore, these processes need to be considered in assessment of the environmental impact associated with offshore oil and gas operations. Crown Copyright (c) 2006 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

A high-performance liquid chromatography fractionation allows one then to isolate each aromatic family in order to limit coelutions between PAHs. Moreover, this purification step reduces the importance of the unresolved complex mixture which otherwise contribute to the GC-isotope ratio MS background signal. The application of this analytical procedure has allowed one to determined PAH isotopic composition in a reference material crude oil (SRM 1582) and a marine sediment (SRM 1944) with good reproducibility as uncertainties between three independent assays performed were lower than 0.5 parts per thousand.

The total area will increase by reclamation and the original shallows will be exploited, which will greatly increase carbon storage. For built-up land, rural land consolidation caused the second-largest carbon storage increase, which might contribute the most as the rural population will continue to decrease in the future, while the decrease of cultivated land will contribute the most to carbon loss.

These robots have allowed scientists to gain important insights to the distribution of life in different marine habitats in unprecedented detail and understand more about the processes that explain where the animals are found. Marine habitats are under increasing pressure from many different human impacts; e.g. fishing, pollution and mineral resource extraction but NERC's research developing innovative monitoring methods has the potential to help industry to improve environmental data collection and monitoring to mitigate environmental impacts. In this Innovation Partnership project we propose to work with the hydrocarbon company Hurricane Energy Plc. We will spend four months working in the company to explore the use of the latest marine robots and other autonomous systems developed by NERC and NOC as well as commercially available systems to improve the quality of information acquired from environmental surveys. The objective is to exchange knowledge with Hurricane to help increase the quality and efficiency of these surveys. There will be a phase of the project in which we work directly with Hurricane Energy's environmental manager to determine their requirements. This will be followed by a phase in which we propose a series of options based on different types of technology to address their environmental data collection challenges. These will be compared with conventional methods of environmental data collection to enable Hurricane to make informed choices and will include liaison with the industry regulators. The project draws on experience working with industry to incorporate MAS into routine operations and emergency response to oil spills (NE/P013228/1) and environmental monitoring of decommissioned oil and gas infrastructure (NE/P016561/1). It will also make use of real-world experience from scientific AUV and fixed-point observatory use; in particular on the NOC's development of pioneering methods to assess spatial ecology of benthic habitats e.g. NERC AESA project NE/H021787/1 and time-series monitoring of the Haig Fras Marine Protected Area, surveys of Rockall Bank and long-term monitoring at the Porcupine Abyssal Plain through the NERC Sustained Observing Programme. It also gains from NOC's existing collaborative project with Hurricane Energy through their participation in the NOC led SERPENT Project (use of industry remotely operated vehicles during stand-by time for scientific study).This work is particularly relevant and timely as Hurricane Energy develop the Greater Lancaster Area and will begin explooration of the Greater Warwick Area, West of Shetland, UK.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,NE/S009426/1,,,,,,,,National Oceanography Centre,National Oceanography Centre,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:15403623,,

With this information it is possible to assist the municipality in reducing beach erosion and implementing sustainable measures for better coastal development. It was found that the sediments from Baia de Guanabara have sedimentation rates ranging from 0.63 to 13.25 cm/min. Solid content is relatively low, consistent with the fact that they are unconsolidated sediments. The particle size distribution of the sediments reflects the depth of the water column of Baia de Guanabara; the deeper the water column, the coarser the sediment. However, the sediment shows plasticity, suggesting the presence of organic matter derived from the 20 m(3)s(-1) raw sewage discharged into the bay. Fine sediments are found near shore; these are fluvial in origin or come from diffuse pollution sources.

In particular, PAHs were more resistant to degradation, and their persistence could have deleterious impacts on the sediment ecosystem. This study aimed to evaluate the microbial recovery of coastal sediments from the HSOS by analyzing the structure and diversity of the microbial community and its functional contribution to PAHs degradation. High-throughput sequencing on the MiSeq platform was conducted using tidal flat sediments collected in 2014 and 2016 from the area contaminated by the HSOS. The microbial recovery was evaluated by various diversity factors, including microbial composition and structure and functional diversity based on PICRUSt analysis. The abundance of microbial taxa associated with TPH degradation was higher in 2014 than that in 2016, but the taxa associated with PAHs degradation were similar between years. These results are consistent with the dynamics of microbes associated with the fate of pollutants, and they also showed similar tendency in functional profiles. That is, even if the pollutants are completely degraded, the microbial community has not yet completely recovered from the HSOS. The evaluation of microbial ecosystems in contaminated environments should consider both the fate of pollutants and the dynamics of microbial species that make functional contributions to the degradation of pollutants.",,,,,,,,,33,0,0,0,26,0,33,,,0160-4120,1873-6750,,,,,,,,,,"Korea Univ, Coll Life Sci & Biotechnol, Div Environm Sci & Ecol Engn, Seoul 02841, South KoreaSeoul Natl Univ, Sch Earth & Environm Sci, Seoul 08826, South KoreaSeoul Natl Univ, Res Inst Oceanog, Seoul 08826, South Korea",,,,2019-06-04,WOS:000467938500011,31035114,

We evaluate the contention that their recovery spanned over two decades. A model based on the otter age-at-death distribution suggested a large, spill-related population sink, but this has never been found, and other model predictions failed to match empirical data. Studies focused on a previously-oiled area where otter numbers (similar to 80) stagnated post-spill; nevertheless, post-spill abundance exceeded the most recent pre-spill count, and population trends paralleled an adjacent, unoiled-lightly-oiled area. Some investigators posited that otters suffered chronic effects by digging up buried oil residues while foraging, but an ecological risk assessment indicated that exposure levels via this pathway were well below thresholds for toxicological effects. Significant confounding factors, including killer whale predation, subsistence harvests, human disturbances, and environmental regime shifts made it impossible to judge recovery at such a small scale.

This underlines the importance of identifying the organizational factors that affect the level of safety compliant behavior. The purpose of the present study was to examine how workers' perception of leadership involvement in daily work operations affects the level of safety compliant behavior among workers employed on offshore platforms operating on the Norwegian Continental Shelf. The effect that leadership involvement exerts on safety compliance was measured both directly and indirectly through the intervening variable work climate. Using survey data from six different measure periods (N = 10003), exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis identified three dimensions of work climate; (1) workers' competence and involvement, (2) role clarity and (3) follow-up of contractors. The following SEM analyses revealed that leadership involvement in daily work operations has a significant positive influence on the level of safety compliance on offshore platforms. The effect of leadership involvement was found to be both direct and indirect, mediated by the three work climate dimensions selected for this study. Theoretical and managerial implications of the findings are discussed. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

It is found that there are no specific environmental risk regulations suitable for CO2 storage in China, and environmental risk management lags behind the development of CCS technology, which presents a challenge to demonstration enterprises in terms of assessing environmental risk. One major challenge is the overestimation or underestimation of this risk on the part of the enterprise, and another is a lack of applicable regulations for government sectors to supervise the risk throughout CCS projects.

Currently, marine reserves (no-take areas) cover approximately 2.2% of the world's oceans whilst most calls and targets suggest protection levels should be between 20% and 30% in order to achieve both conservation and resource management objectives. In this study a systematic conservation planning framework was developed using ecological and socio-economic data. This framework was used to test different protection scenarios in Portugal. The current situation in mainland Portugal is alarming, with 0.2% of the waters under national jurisdiction included in MPAs and only 0.002% being marine reserves. Moreover, ecologically important habitats, such as seagrass beds and maerl beds, have less than 10% of their area protected. The solutions provided by Marxan, and subsequently improved with MinPatch, revealed that there is a need to considerably increase the area under protection. However, adequate protection could be achieved with a number of MPAs (between 5 and 14) similar to the number of already existing MPAs (n = 8). Different stakeholders (artisanal fisheries, industrial fisheries, and other human uses such as oil and gas, and offshore aquaculture) were considered in different scenarios, with the results of the multivariate analysis indicating that there are several solutions that satisfy all stakeholders.

The geology and petroleum systems of these productive basins are reviewed, summarized and updated according to the most recent developments. We have linked the recognized petroleum systems to common stages in the geological evolution of these synrift to postrift basins and classified them accordingly. We recognize four Petroleum System Types (PSTs) corresponding to the four main stages of geodynamic basin development, and developed variably in the different basins depending on their depositional environment history: (i) an oil-prone Early Synrift Lacustrine PST, found in the Eocene to Oligocene deeper parts of the synrift grabens, (ii) an oil and gas-prone Late Synrift Transgressive Deltaic PST, located in the shallower Oligocene to early Miocene portions of the synrift grabens, (iii) a gas-prone Early Postrift Marine PST, characteristic of the overlying early Miocene transgressive period, and (iv) an oil and gas-prone Late Postrift Regressive Deltaic PST, forming the shallowest late Tertiary basin fills. We have ascribed the petroleum systems in each of the basins to one of these types, recognizing that considerable mixing of the predominantly lacustrine to terrestrial charge has taken place. Furthermore, we have grouped the basins according to their predominant PSTs and identified basin families that share important aspects of their hydrocarbon habitat: these have been termed proximal, intermediate, distal, Borneo and eastern Indonesian, according to their palaeogeographic relationship to the Sunda craton of Southeast Asia.

Added to this scenario is the gradual depletion of the offshore oil and gas fields which is pushing future explorations and production activities far away into the hostile environment of deep sea. Production of gas in such environment has great technical and commercial impacts on gas business. For instance, laying gas pipes from deep sea to distant receiving terminals will be technically and economically challenging. Alternative to laying gas pipes will require installing re-liquefaction unit on board FPSOs to convert gas into liquid for transportation by sea. But, then because of increased distance between gas source and receiving terminals the current medium size LNG ships will no longer remain economical to operate. Recognizing this business scenario shipowners are making huge investments in the acquisition of large LNG ships. As power need of large LNG ships is very different from the current small ones, a variety of propulsion derivatives such as UST, DFDE, 2-Stroke DRL and Combined cycle GT have been proposed by leading engine manufacturers. Since, propulsion system constitutes major element of the ship's capital and life cycle cost, which of these options is most suited for large LNG ships is currently a major concern of the shipping industry and must be thoroughly assessed. In this paper the authors investigate relative merits of these propulsion options against the benchmark performance criteria of BOG disposal, fuel consumption, gas emissions, plant availability and overall life cycle cost.",,,,,1st International Conference on Mechanical Engineering Research (ICMER)1st International Conference on Mechanical Engineering Research (ICMER),"DEC 05-07, 2011DEC 05-07, 2011",,"Kuantan, MALAYSIAKuantan, MALAYSIA",12,0,0,0,0,0,13,,,1757-8981,,*****************,,,,,,,,,"Malaysian Maritime Acad, Dept Marine Engn, Batu Rakit, Kuala Terenggan, MalaysiaUniv Malaysia Terengganu, Fac Maritime Studies & Marine Sci, Dept Maritime Technol, Terengganu, Malaysia",Malaysian Maritime Acad,,,2012-11-28,WOS:000309605200004,,

As CO2 leakages into near surface formations appear to be very unlikely within pilot CCS projects, the aim of this work is to emulate a leakage by injecting CO2 into a near surface aquifer. The two main questions pursued by the injection test are (1) to investigate the impact of CO2 on the hydrogeochemistry of the groundwater as a base for groundwater risk assessment and (2) to develop and apply monitoring methods and monitoring concepts for detecting CO2 leakages in shallow aquifers.The presented injection test is planned within the second half of 2010, as a joint project of the University of Kiel (Germany), the Helmholtz-Centre for Environmental Research (Leipzig, Germany) and the Engineering Company GICON (Dresden, Germany). The test site has been investigated in detail using geophysical methods as well as direct-push soundings, groundwater well installation and soil and groundwater analyses.

The hybrid concept integrates offshore wind power with gas turbines and a H-2 energy storage solution based on proton exchange membrane fuel cells and electrolysers. The objectives are: 1) improve the environmental performance of offshore installations by maximizing the exploitation of offshore wind and partially decarbonizing the gas turbines by co-feeding H-2; 2) minimize the negative effects that wind power variability has on the electrical grid frequency stability. This study presents a first assessment of the HES-OFF concept performance using an offshore platform in the North Sea as case study. The results show that the HES-OFF concept: 1) cuts CO2 emissions up to 40 % when compared to the reference case but requires large H-2 storage capacity to fully exploit wind power throughout the year; 2) allows higher wind power penetration without infringing on the grid frequency requirements.,,,,,30 European Symposium on Computer-Aided Process Engineering (ESCAPE)30 European Symposium on Computer-Aided Process Engineering (ESCAPE),"AUG 30-SEP 02, 2020AUG 30-SEP 02, 2020",,ELECTR NETWORKELECTR NETWORK,2,0,0,0,0,0,2,,,1570-7946,,978-0-12-823377-1,,,,,,,,,"Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol NTNU, Dept Energy & Proc Engn, N-7491 Trondheim, NorwayNorwegian Univ Sci & Technol NTNU, Dept Elect Power Engn, N-7034 Trondheim, Norway",,,,2021-06-23,WOS:000652152900036,,

Much of the carbon removed from the atmosphere has been suspected to have entered the deep oceans, but evidence for increased carbon storage remains elusive. Here we use the B/Ca ratios of benthic foraminifera from several sites across the Atlantic Ocean to reconstruct changes in the carbonate ion concentration and hence the carbon inventory of the deep Atlantic across this transition. We find that deep Atlantic carbonate ion concentration declined by around 25 mu mol kg(-1) between similar to 80,000 and 65,000 years ago. This drop implies that the deep Atlantic carbon inventory increased by at least 50 Gt around the same time as the amount of atmospheric carbon dropped by about 60 Gt. From a comparison with proxy records of deep circulation and climate model simulations, we infer that the carbon sequestration coincided with a shoaling of the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation. We thus conclude that changes in the Atlantic Ocean circulation may have played an important role in reductions of atmospheric CO2 concentrations during the last glaciation, by increasing the carbon storage in the deep Atlantic.",,,,,,,,,59,0,0,0,6,0,65,,,1752-0894,1752-0908,,,,,,,,,,"Australian Natl Univ, Res Sch Earth Sci, GPO Box 4, Canberra, ACT 2601, AustraliaUniv New S Wales, Climate Change Res Ctr, Sydney, NSW 2052, AustraliaARC Ctr Excellence Climate Syst, Sydney, NSW 2052, AustraliaChinese Acad Sci, Inst Earth Environm, State Key Lab Loess & Quaternary Geol, Xian 710075, Peoples R ChinaUCL, Dept Geog, Mortimer St, London WC1E 6BT, EnglandCardiff Univ, Sch Earth & Ocean Sci, Cardiff CF10 3XQ, S Glam, WalesUniv Southampton, Natl Oceanog Ctr, Ocean & Earth Sci, Southampton SO14 3ZH, Hants, EnglandNanyang Technol Univ, Earth Observ Singapore, 50 Nanyang Ave, Singapore 639798, SingaporeE China Normal Univ, Sch Geog Sci, Shanghai 200241, Peoples R ChinaColumbia Univ, Lamont Doherty Earth Observ, 61 Route 9W POB 1000, Palisades, NY 10964 USA",ARC Ctr Excellence Climate Syst,,,2016-04-01,WOS:000373374100019,,

Multi-objective network optimization highlighted previously unreported step changes in the structure of optimal subnetworks for protection associated with minimal changes in cost or benefit functions. This emphasizes the desirability of performing a full, unconstrained, multi-objective optimization for marine spatial planning. Brute force methods, examining all possible combinations of protected and unprotected sites for a network of sites, are impractical for all but the smallest networks as the number of possible networks grows as 2(m), where m is the number of sites within the network. A metaheuristic method based around Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods is described which searches for the set of Pareto optimal networks (or a good approximation thereto) given two separate objective functions, for example for network quality or effectiveness, population persistence, or cost of protection. The optimization and search methods are independent of the choice of objective functions and can be easily extended to more than two functions. The speed, accuracy and convergence of the method under a range of network configurations are tested with model networks based on an extension of random geometric graphs. Examination of two real-world marine networks, one designated for the protection of the stony coral Lophelia pertusa, the other a hypothetical man-made network of oil and gas installations to protect hard substrate ecosystems, demonstrates the power of the method in finding multi-objective optimal solutions for networks of up to 100 sites.

A total number of 394 records, within the period 1980 to 1997, are investigated in this study. The analysis identifies that:3.55% incidents were classed as 'severe', 10.9% incidents as 'moderate' and the remainder as 'minor', 'none' or 'unspecified';the vast majority of incidents (97.97%) have occurred with oil field offshore support vessels or attendant vessels;supply vessels form the most frequent colliding vessel type, accounting for 249 out of 394 incidents [63.2%];more incidents have occurred during the period September to February [52.5% of the total known cases];the total risk associated with supply vessels collision appears to have decreased with time, notably for fixed installations;the two most common operating circumstances at time of collision for supply vessels were platform approach and container or bulb transfer; as for standby vessels the major operating circumstance was platform approach and close support;human control failure in terms of misjudgement is the most frequent quoted primary cause for failure, especially for 'severe' or 'moderate' incidents/accidents. Mechanical control failure is the second most frequent quoted primary cause;the most probable collision orientation for supply vessels is stern-on for both fixed and mobile installations, accounting for about 50% of all known cases;the number of incident occurrence in the Southern North Sea is about 30% of the total,for incidents resulting in 'minor', 'none' damage the risk in the Northern North Sea is about 3 to 4 times higher than that for the Central North Sea and 10 times higher than that for the Southern North Sea.The statistical analysis reveals that good seamanship by vessel masters is probably responsible for mitigating the magnitude of many of the impacts that do occur and also that there is a need for improvement in safety performance.",,,,,Conference on Foresight and PrecautionConference on Foresight and Precaution,"MAY 15-17, 2000MAY 15-17, 2000",European Safety & Reliabil Assoc; Soc Risk Anal Europe; Safety & Reliabil SocEuropean Safety & Reliabil Assoc; Soc Risk Anal Europe; Safety & Reliabil Soc,"EDINBURGH, SCOTLANDEDINBURGH, SCOTLAND",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,90-5809-140-6,,,,,,,,,"Staffordshire Univ, Sch Engn & Adv Technol, Stafford, England",,,,2000-01-01,WOS:000088745600091,,

This paper constitutes the first broad scale analysis of spur and groove systems in the Capricorn Bunker Group (CBG) in the southern GBR. It uses remotely sensed imagery coupled with ground-truthed data to measure groove length at four reefs (Wreck, Heron, One Tree and Lady Elliot). A total of 2621 grooves were digitised across the four study reefs. Groove length was found to vary both between and within the study reefs. The maximum groove length was 536 m. Average groove length ranged from 93 in at Wreck Reef to 32 in at Heron Reef. This data was compared to relative wave exposure estimates derived from the fetch scenario at each reef. Strong positive correlation was found with groove length increasing as wave exposure increased. Groove length was highly spatially dependant and varied around the reef platforms according to the degree of wave exposure.

Offshore wind energy production offers the potential for wide-scale energy production due to its advantages over its onshore counterpart including less visual pollution, less competition with agricultural operations, more/stronger consistent winds.However, offshore wind generation suffers from an increased Levelized Cost Of Electricity due to a range of factors; increased operational, installation/maintenance costs, significant safety issues and limited operating conditions. A key focus of the UK government is to reduce the costs associated with offshore energy production mainly associated with operating in a marine environment, which includes the need for a recognised dynamic positioning solution for monitoring two objects in motion efficiently and safely.Rinicom aims to further develop and validate their Six-Axis Monitoring (SAM) technology in a relevant environment using existing video analytics and machine vision algorithms to a novel offshore wind use-case using off the shelf components to ensure ease of integration and a cost-effective solution. This project will also leverage the expertise of Edda Supply Ships (a subsidiary of Østensjø Rederi) to test and validate the SAM technology. This technology offers a step-change with respect to marine-based dynamic positioning and monitoring systems, with improved accuracy, low latency, lower costs and ease of retrofitting and integration into existing vessel systems, enabling the reduction of costs associated with operational and maintenance aspects of offshore wind energy generation, benefitting society as a whole.With market need validated (through discussions with end-users including Edda Supply Ships) and building upon previous proof of concept in-house laboratory studies that presented promising accuracy results (acceleration/velocity accuracy: <99%, displacement accuracy: 5cm at 50m), this project will further develop the SAM technology and validate a prototype in a relevant environment. This novel technology has the potential to completely revolutionise the way in which installations and maintenance is undertaken on offshore energy infrastructure in order to reduce the cost of operation, increase number of operational days and increase the safety of operating heavy machinery in challenging conditions. This innovative solution has the potential to be exploited across the globe in a range key sectors (including oil and gas, passenger ferries, etc.) and will reduce the overall Localised Cost of Electricity for offshore wind energy.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,72798,,,,,,,,Rinicom Limited,,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:15379240,,

Periplus Archeomare BV carried out a side-scan sonar survey of the bottom of the eastern Wadden sea. As a result of this survey, a small number of locations was selected for further investigation. The main aim was to determine the archaelogical potential of these locations. At a distance of 29 meters from the proposed route of the electricity cable, a shipwreck was discovered on location D1.On the 19th, 20th and 21st of April, 2006, Archaeological Research & Consultancy (ARC bv), Groningen, participated in investigating the potentially interesting locations, D1, D2 and D5, by a diving-unit, carried out by Subcom BV and managed by Periplus Archeomare BV. On behalf of ARC bv drs. C.G. Koopstra and mw. drs. J.B. Hielkema, both senior archaeologists, participated in the fieldwork.The finds from location D1, consisting of wooden samples from the wreck and a human bone, were studied by drs. ing. G.J. de Roller and mw. drs. G.M.A. Bergsma. Prof. dr. H.R. Reinders, Groninger Institute of Archaeology (RUG) and drs.W. Kerkmeijer, head collection and conservator of the Noordelijk Scheepvaartmuseum, Groningen, were so kind as to provide additional information about shipwrecks in general, including their archaeological potention.Near the Eemshaven a shipwreck was discovered, that dates from the latter part of the 17th century. Dendrochronological dating of wood from this ship indicates that the ship was built after 1667 AD. The relatively huge size of the planks and beams indicate that it may be a large seafaring ship. The remains that are still embedded in the clay, are well preserved. The parts of the ship that are exposed, however, are afflicted by shipworm, white paddock and probably other sea-organisms. This means that erosion of the ship will continue, unless some action is undertaken to consolidate the condition of the shipwreck.

Edge effects are among the most significant consequences of forest fragmentation. Therefore, understanding the impacts of edge creation on biodiversity is crucial for forest management and biological conservation.2. In this study, we used trait-based and phylogenetic approaches to examine the effects of fragmentation on components of diversity and above-ground biomass of rainforest tree communities in Madagascar in forest edge vs. interior habitats.3. Tree communities in forest edges showed lower phylogenetic diversity relative to those in interior habitats, suggesting that some clades may be more vulnerable to environmental filtering than others. Functional diversity was also significantly lower on the edge for productivity traits, but not for dispersal traits. Tree communities in the forest edge showed higher divergence of dispersal traits and lower divergence in productivity traits than expected, while functional diversity in interior forest did not differ from random expectations. This suggests that separate mechanisms affect productivity traits vs. dispersal traits in edge habitats.4. There was no significant difference in above-ground biomass between edge and interior habitats, suggesting that edge effects have not yet negatively influenced the forest's potential for carbon storage. However, these changes may not have occurred yet, given the slow turnover of tree communities.5. Synthesis and applications. Our results highlight the role of edge effects in the erosion of functional and phylogenetic diversity of highly diverse tree communities. While above-ground biomass did not appear to be affected by forest edge in our study, we suggest long-term monitoring of forests for potential changes in ecosystem functioning.

As offshore oil and gas exploration is pushed into deep waters, difficulties encountered in deep-sea riser design may be attributed to the existence of parametric instability regarding platform heave motions. Parametric resonance in risers can cause serious damage which might bring disastrous accidents such as environment pollution, property losses and even fatalities. Therefore, the parametric instability analysis should attract more attention during the design process of deep-sea risers. In this work, an equation of motion for a deep-sea riser is derived firstly. The motion equation is analyzed by the Floquet theory which allows the determination of both system response and stability properties. The unstable regions in which parametric resonance easily occurs can be determined. The effects of damping on parametric instability are also investigated, and the stability maps are presented. The results demonstrate that the available damping is vital in suppressing the instability regions.

The research objectives of this study were designed to assess the ecological risks for human health and aquatic life and to evaluate impacts on environmental changes. Accordingly, an index analysis approach (using the contamination factor Cf, contamination degree Cd, potential ecological risk factor for individual metals Er, and potential ecological risk index for the basin, RI) in conjunction with the enrichment factor (E-f) and sediment quality levels (comprised of the threshold effect level, TEL, the probable effect level, PEL and the effects range medium, ERM) were employed. In total, 147 sediment samples were tested to determine the content of organic matter and sulfur, as well as the concentrations of terrestrial and rare earth elements (REEs) and toxic metals, namely As, Cd, Cr, Cu, Ni and Hg, using inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES). Gulf War oil spills in addition to oil and gas industries of the Pars South Especial Economic Zone (PSEEZ) were identified as the primary source of pollution in the study area. Gulf War contamination in the study area is highlighted by increased levels of Cd and RI at key horizons at 29 cm, 35 cm and 49 cm depth in the sedimentary columns of the Assaluyeh and Bassatin estuaries and Gavbandi River, respectively. Adverse effects of PSEEZ were revealed by increasing concentrations of toxic metals, P and S in the top 25-30 cm of the sedimentary columns. As a result, superficial sediments have been severely polluted by As, Ni, Cd, Cu and Cr, while the entire sedimentary column of the Assaluyeh estuary has been polluted by Hg. Based on the locations of the key horizons, the sedimentation rates of the previous decade at the Assaluyeh and Bassatin estuaries and the Gavbandi River were calculated to be 1.26 cm, 1.52 cm, and 2.13 cm, respectively. The capability of the index analysis approach, as well as of certain lanthanides, for highlighting environmental evolutionary trends in catchments in which extensive land use changes have occurred was demonstrated by the present investigation. The present research concluded that aquatic life and human health in the study area have been subjected to different ranges of hazards by toxic metals due to regional and local anthropogenic activities.

Ongoing environmental pressures exerted by large-scale land reclamation for residential quarters, refuse and sewage dumping, and other uses, however, are suspected to have had a substantial impact on ecological health of the Lagos wetland ecosystems over the last few decades. To determine the impact of these pressures, we examined spatial changes in three wetlands areas- Badore/Langbasa (BL), Festac/Iba/Ijegun (FI) and Ologe/Otto-Awori (OO) through field sample collection and analyses of surface water, sediments, air-water interface gas fluxes and vegetations. Surface water conductivity, total suspended solids (TSS), alkalinity, chloride, biological oxygen demand (BOD), nitrate, phosphate and heavy metals (Zn, Cu, Fe, Na, Mn, Pb, Cd, K and Ni) exhibited relative spatial stability while other water quality parameters varied significantly (P < 0.05) across the wetland areas. Also, dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) contributed to most of the total dissolved solids (TDS) since only DIC correlated significantly with TDS (r = 0.889; P = 0.05, n = 12) and TS (r = 0.891; P = 0.05, n = 12), suggesting a strong capacity for carbon sequestration and carbon sink across the wetland areas. None of the encountered vegetation species are in the vulnerable category of the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). There are indications of steady rise in greenhouse gas levels in Lagos since air CO2 value at BL have reached global threshold of 400 ppm with OO and FI closely approaching. We conclude that the Lagos wetland ecosystems, especially OO and FI still have some semblance of natural habitat. However, further destruction and unwise use of the resources could cause damage to physical, chemical, geological and biological processes in nature, which could result to grave socio-economic and cultural consequences to the local communities whose livelihood and lifestyle depend on these valued wetlands.

Results from the integrated modeling showed that the soluble benzene and naphthalene components reach chronic no-effect concentration levels at a distance of 1.0 m from the discharge point.

Fin whales exhibit strong diel patterns in dive behavior, remaining near the surface for most of the night, but how this behavior affects ship-strike risk is unknown. We combined diel patterns of surface use, habitat suitability predictions, and ship traffic data to evaluate spatial and temporal trends in ship-strike risk to fin whales of the California Current System (CCS). We tested a range of surface-use scenarios and found that both increased use of the upper water column and increased ship traffic contribute to elevated ship-strike risk at night. Lengthening nights elevate risk during winter throughout the CCS, though the Southern California Bight experienced consistently high risk both day and night year-round. Within designated shipping lanes, total annual nighttime strike risk was twice daytime risk.

In this work the exergy cost for oil and gas produced on a Floating Production Storage and Offload (FPSO) ship is evaluated along the lifespan of the well taking off-design operation conditions of process plant and cogeneration plant into account. The impact of 3 different cogeneration plants and 2 different process plant operating modes was assessed. Distribution of exergy costs for the oil and gas was obtained using thermoeconomy to reduce the arbitrariness of cost partition criteria. Results reveal that the exergy cost of oil varies from 1.0 kJ/kJ to 3.2 kJ/kJ along the well lifespan depending on process plant operating mode and cogeneration plant configuration. The exergy cost of gas varies from 1.0 kJ/kJ to 2.4 kJ/kJ along the well lifespan depending on cogeneration plant configuration. The average emission of CO2 for the natural gas ranges from 19.0 gCO2/MJ to 19.8 gCO2/MJ depending on the cogeneration plant configuration while for the oil it ranges from 19.4 gCO2/MJ to 26.8 gCO2/MJ and it also depends on process plant operating mode.

In this study, mooring line fatigue analysis was performed considering the OPB/IPB of a spread moored FPSO in deep sea. The tension of the mooring line was derived by hydrodynamic analysis using the de-coupled analysis method. The floater motion time histories were calculated under the assumption that the mooring line behaves in quasi-static manner. Additional time domain analysis was carried out by prescribing the obtained motions on top of the selected critical mooring line, which was determined based on spectral fatigue analysis. In addition, nonlinear finite element analysis was performed considering the material nonlinearities, and both the interlink stiffness and stress concentration factors were derived.

Final report.,,,,,,,,OCS Study Report MMS,,,,2002-043,,,,i,"x, 1-66, A1-A8, B1-B8, C1-C23",,,,,,,,,,,Article,2002,2002,"This report describes results of aerial surveys conducted to determine the distribution and abundance of ringed seals (Phoca hispida) in the central Beaufort Sea off Alaska. This was a cooperative project funded by the U.S. Department of the Interior, Minerals Management Service, with additional support contributed by the Alaska Department of Fish and Game, the National Marine Fisheries Service, the University of Alaska, and the North Slope Borough. Specific objectives were to: 1) review and refine protocols for monitoring ringed seals by aerial surveys; 2) estimate relative abundance and density of ringed seals on fast ice in the Beaufort Sea during 1996-1999 and compare with data collected during 1985-1987; and 3) correlate observed ringed seal densities on fast ice with environmental parameters. Data from two sets of aerial surveys for ringed seals in the Alaska Beaufort Sea are analyzed in this report. The 1985-1987 surveys were conducted under NOAA Contract 84-ABC-00210 to the Alaska Department of Fish and Game as part of the Alaska Outer Continental Shelf Environmental Assessment Program. The 1996-1999 surveys were funded through Cooperative Agreement 14-35-0001-30810 between the Minerals Management Service and the Alaska Department of Fish and Game. Ringed seals are a widespread, circumpolar species, that in Alaskan waters occur in the Beaufort, Chukchi, and Bering seas, usually in association with sea ice. Although they also occur in pack ice, ringed seals are the only species of seal in Alaska that commonly lives on and under the extensive, largely unbroken, shorefast ice. They make and maintain breathing holes in the ice from freeze-up until breakup. As day length and temperature increase in the spring, increasing numbers of ringed seals haul out on the surface of the ice near breathing holes or lairs. This hauling-out or basking is associated with the annual molt, which occurs in May-July. It is during this time that seals are most readily observed and counted. The shorefast ice also provides a reasonably safe and convenient surface on which various human activities are conducted. Coastal residents have traditionally used the fast ice to hunt for seals and other marine mammals. More recently the oil and gas industry has used the fast ice for conducting certain phases of petroleum exploration and development. Currently, a warming climate trend is causing changes in the characteristics of sea ice which may affect both ringed seals and humans, and the ice they live on and use. Because such human activities may impact seal populations, and because climate change may affect ringed seal habitat, it is important to monitor changes in distribution and abundance over both short and long term time scales. We conducted aerial surveys during late May and early June 1996-1999 in the Beaufort Sea between Point Barrow and Kaktovik (156... 36'W to 143...42'W), an east-west extent of approximately 500 km. Two experienced primary observers counted seals using the strip transect protocols established during 1985-1987 surveys. Surveys transects were laid out along lines of longitude, and extended from approximately the 3 m depth contour to 40+ km offshore. Survey altitude was 91 m, and strip width was 0.41 km on each side of the aircraft. The survey aircraft had oversized bubble windows, radar altimeter, and an onboard navigation system linked to computers operated by data recorders. Three ice variables were recorded: ice type (fast or pack), percent ice deformation, and percent of the ice surface covered by melt water. Weather conditions were recorded at the beginning of each transect and whenever conditions changed. A subset of the data collected and reported in 1985-1987 was reanalyzed and incorporated in this report. Data used in the reanalysis included surveys conducted at 91 m altitude in sectors B1-B4. During the 1990s survey effort, complete coverage of the Alaskan Beaufort Sea (sectors B1-B4) was obtained for 1997 and 1999. During 1996 and 1998 only sectors B3 and B4 were surveyed. Only data within 40 km of shore in sectors B3 and B4 were included in the final analysis of all years. We calculated simple or raw densities of observed ringed seals by dividing the number of seals counted within the strata of interest by the area of that strata. Univariate analyses of the effects of habitat, weather, and time of day were done using chi-square goodness-of-fit tests. We also used Poisson regression to model the relationship of seal counts to ovariates. Although date has a strong effect on seal counts, our 1996-1999 surveys did not include enough temporal coverage to include date as an explanatory variable. The dataset for 1985-1987 included 71-80 transect lines each year. We counted 2,189 seals on 2,271 km 2 of ice habitat in 1985, 2,605 seals on 2,361 km 2 in 1986 and 3,867 seals on 2,524 km 2 of ice in 1987. Total survey effort during 1996-1999 included 40-139 transect lines per year. We counted 1,612 seals on 1,961 km 2 in 1996, 3,429 seals on 4,288 km 2 in 1997, 1,111 seals on 1,198 km 2 in 1998 and 3,796 seals on 3,697 km 2 in 1999. Ringed seals were broadly distributed throughout the study area in all years. Observed densities for fast ice and pack ice combined in the 1980s ranged from 1.01 seals/km 2 in 1985 to 1.85 seals/km 2 in 1987. Observed densities for the 1990s were similar to 1985 and somewhat lower than in 1986 and 1987, ranging from 0.81 seals/km 2 in 1996 to 1.17 seals/km 2 in 1999. The range in density estimates from the Poisson regression model was somewhat greater. There was a threefold difference between the modeled densities for 1985 (2.25 seals/km 2 ) and 1999 (0.64 seals/km 2 ). The habitat-related variables water depth, location relative to the fast ice edge, and ice deformation had substantial and consistent effects on the distribution and abundance of seals in the study area. The highest seal densities occurred between >5 m and 25 m depths. Similar depth preferences have been found in other ringed seal studies done in comparable habitats. Seals were most numerous near the shorefast ice edge, with densities declining both shoreward and seaward of the edge. Substantial variability may have been introduced into the analysis of density relative to distance from the edge because of the subjectivity and difficulty of visually determining the position of the fast ice edge. It is unclear what makes the ice edge so attractive to ringed seals and results in higher densities at this fast ice-pack ice interface. Seals feed at a reduced rate at this time of year when they are entering the molt. Higher densities near the edge could reflect diminished territoriality of seals breeding on shorefast ice, and/or an influx of seals from other regions as the ice begins to crack and break and the molt approaches. We found a strong and consistent relationship between seal densities and the degree of ice deformation in all years and for all years combined, with more seals found in flatter, less deformed ice. We think this difference is related to seal behavior and not to observer bias in highly deformed ice. Ringed seals are a primary prey of polar bears, and the constant threat of predation has shaped their behavior on the ice. Seals haul out to bask in areas where they can see and smell approaching predators, and where they can escape down holes or cracks too small for a polar bear to follow. Thus, it is not surprising that observed densities of basking ringed seals are higher in flat ice than in rough, ridged ice where polar bears hunt most commonly. Univariate analysis of our data from 1985-1999 suggested that observed densities of seals were generally highest between about 1100 and 1400 hrs local time (solar noon is about 1300 hrs). In contrast, Poisson regression models predicted that densities would be highest at 1000 or 1100 hrs and decline steadily throughout the day. Results of the Poisson analysis were inconsistent with behavioral data from tagged seals, which indicate that more seals haul out in mid day. Analyses of the effects of weather factors on seal counts were inconclusive. This was likely at least partially due to the fact that temperature and wind speed were measured at the survey altitude of 91 m rather than on the surface of the ice. Furthermore, surveys were conducted in weather considered suitable for hauling out, and the survey window excluded very windy or stormy weather. Other investigators have also concluded that multivariate regression using wide-area survey data is ineffective for determining the effects of weather. It was our hope at the beginning of this project that we might be able to use Poisson regression to model the effects of covariates and to correct the data collected in different years to standard conditions, thus making our estimated index of ringed seal density more accurate and our interpretation of trend more reliable. However, the results of our analyses demonstrated difficulties with such an approach. For several habitat-related covariates (ice deformation, distance from the fast ice edge, water depth), results of univariate and multivariate analyses indicated similar relationships. For others (e.g., weather), neither analysis was particularly informative. Despite attempts to standardize survey methodology, substantial intra- and interannual variability in survey conditions and ice characteristics is unavoidable. This makes it difficult to identify trends in abundance. Interannual comparisons of seal abundance may reflect the overall status of the population, annual differences in distribution caused by variation in habitat characteristics, differences in the proportion hauled out, or a combination thereof. Our surveys were not designed to quantify date effects on seal behavior. We had hoped that by narrowing the survey window and conducting surveys before breakup and melting occurred we could minimize the effect of date. However, recent information from radiotagged seals indicates the change from hauling out in lairs to basking in the open is rapid and annually variable, and such behavior may significantly affect the number of seals counted even over a narrow period of time. Future efforts to improve our estimates of trend should include quantification of the effects of within and between-year temporal variation on survey counts. We also conducted power analysis to evaluate our ability to detect changes in ringed seal abundance and as a means of evaluating whether Poisson regression models improved out ability to detect trend. Power analysis was based on simulations for two levels of effort, two time periods, and positive or negative annual trend changes of 0%-20% . Power to detect trend was low for all combinations of sample size, years, and population change. Almost no additional power was gained by adding 30% more lines to the survey coverage. However, power increased markedly when the survey period was increased from 5 years to 10 years. With 5 years of surveys, the power to detect a 20% annual decline was only 0.23 (P=0.05) for the raw data and 0.51 for Poisson modeled data. With 10 years of surveys, power increased to 0.53 and 0.73 for raw and modeled counts. Our analysis indicated almost no power (8%-32%) to detect an annual trend of 5%, a more realistic rate of change for a ringed seal population. This suggests that current methods of collecting and analyzing aerial survey need to be improved if the data are to be useful for detecting trends in abundance. Both observed and modeled densities of ringed seals in the central Beaufort Sea indicated considerable annual variability on both fast ice and pack ice. The lowest observed annual density during the 1980s was similar to densities in 1998 and 1999 and about 25% higher than the lowest density during the 1990s. The highest annual density during the 1980s survey period, however, was more than double the highest density for the 1990s. The range in density estimates from the Poisson regression model was somewhat greater, with a threefold difference between the modeled densities for 1985 and 1999. Trend analysis based on an ANOVA comparison of observed density estimates suggested a marginally significant (p=0.09) but substantial decline of 31% from the 1980s to the 1990s. The Poisson regression model indicated highly significant (p<0.001) declines of 72% on fast ice and 43% on pack ice over the 15-year period. However, the apparent decline between the 1980s and the 1990s may be due to a difference in the timing of surveys rather than an actual decline in abundance. The 1980s surveys were conducted substantially later (June 6-12) than surveys in the 1990s (May 27-June 4). If the phenology of seal basking was comparably earlier in the 1990s than in the 1980s then the decline in seal numbers may well be real. However if such a change in seal basking did not occur, then the 1990s surveys were flown at a time when a relatively small proportion of seals were visible and the apparent decline could be an artifact. Regardless of whether or not the differences in ringed seal densities described above are real, there are several reasons to think that ringed seal abundance in the Beaufort Sea either has changed or is likely to change in the future. Beaufort Sea populations of polar bears, which prey on ringed seals, and bowhead whales, which compete with them for food, have increased since the 1970s. Furthermore, as climate warms, impacts on ringed seal distribution, abundance, and productivity will likely result from the combined effects of changes in physical habitats, changes in prey populations, and changes in inter-species interactions.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"School of Fisheries and Ocean Sciences, University of Alaska Fairbanks, 1550 Coyote Trail, Fairbanks, AK 99709-6009, USA",,,,2002-01-01,ZOOREC:ZOOR13900008017,,

Many offshore operations require an assessment of the potential impact of underwater noise on the environment, which requires knowledge of the sound transmitted by the subsea components.Until now very little is known about the underwater source mechanisms, the acoustic strength of these underwater networks, the coupling of the emitted source sound to the surrounding medium and the impact of the sound on the underwater wildlife. The dynamic behavior of networks for compressing and transporting gas, and the translation into emitted noise into air are rather well understood. However, due to the presence of the water the dynamic behavior from such subsea installation is very different than in air. To predict the dynamic behavior, the presence of the water cannot be neglected and has to be taken into account.This paper presents a simplified model for a subsea high speed turbo-compressor coupled to the KrakenC normal mode propagation model. With this combined model the noise at remote locations can be predicted and compared with the ambient noise and other anthropogenic noise sources such as for instance shipping, dredging and wind farm operation noise.",,,,,"33rd ASME International Conference on Ocean, Offshore and Arctic Engineering33rd ASME International Conference on Ocean, Offshore and Arctic Engineering","JUN 08-13, 2014JUN 08-13, 2014","ASME, Ocean, Offshore & Arct Engn DivASME, Ocean, Offshore & Arct Engn Div","San Francisco, CASan Francisco, CA",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,978-0-7918-4549-3,,,,,,,,,"TNO, Delft, NetherlandsTNO, The Hague, Netherlands",,,,2015-11-11,WOS:000363498400008,,

The fish community is notably species rich and exceeds 100 species in total for the estuary. Standardised long-term sampling at Hinkley Point in Bridgwater Bay gives a total complement of 83 for a single locality and this number is increasing by about one new species every two years. Most of these new species are moving in from centres of population lying to the south of the estuary. Almost all species of fish and macro-crustacean living within the estuary undertake regular migrations so that they tend to move seasonally in waves up and down the estuary. For fish, both species richness and the total abundance reach a maximum in late summer and autumn. The timing of this peak varies between the upper and lower estuary. This seasonal maximum is primarily caused by the arrival of the new recruits which use the estuary as a nursery. In contrast, crustaceans tend to be at their most diverse and abundant in early to mid summer. Using a 30-year time series of fish and crustacean abundance collected at Hinkley Point it is shown that major changes in the structure of the community are now underway and there are considerable recent changes in the abundance. However, some abundant species, including sand goby, Pomatoschistus spp., whiting. Merlangius merlangus and sprat, Sprattus sprattus, the three most abundant species in the estuary, have shown no long-term trend. At present, approximately 20% of the fish and macro-crustaceans observed in Bridgwater Bay are undergoing rapid, typically exponential, change in abundance. For a numerically abundant, diverse, fauna composed of approximately 90 species such levels of change are unexpected and suggest that the system is presently far from equilibrium. In some cases, the observed changes can be related to recent warming and the North Atlantic Oscillation. The overall increase in fish abundance observed may reflect a general improvement in water quality and a reduction in other anthropogenic impacts such as mortality in cooling-water intakes. The potential impacts of tidal power generation in the Severn Estuary are reviewed. There is considerable potential for any major installation to impact the fish and crustacean populations as they migrate and also alter the nature of the habitat resulting in changes in community composition. A particular difficulty in predicting the future impact of harnessing tidal energy is that the present community is already changing rapidly. The ability of fish and crustaceans to pass through the turbines unharmed will be a key issue in an assessment of the impact of tidal power generation. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

They may encounter hydrate-bearing sediments widespread in marine continental margins. The pullout capacity of square anchors embedded shallowly in a hydrate-bearing sand is investigated with small-scale model tests using tetrahydrofuran (THF) hydrate as the substitute of gas hydrate. The results show that the pullout capacity of the anchors increases with the increase of the anchor width and the burial depth. The pullout capacity of the anchors can be estimated by a dimensionless breakout factor. This factor increases with the increase of the burial depth ratio (defined as the ratio of the burial depth to the width of a plate anchor), exhibiting a trend similar to that obtained numerically and experimentally from plate anchors shallowly-embedded in undrained clays. Hydrate dissociation brings detrimental effects on the pullout capacity of the anchors. The pullout capacity of the anchors drops to 0.3% of the initial value after the hydrates dissociate. This pronounced reduction highlights the need for further investigation on the effect of oceanic hydrate dissociation on engineering performance of offshore facilities as a result of natural or anthropologic perturbation.",,,,,,,,,6,1,0,0,0,0,7,,,0029-8018,,,,,,,,,,,"Tongji Univ, State Key Lab Disaster Reduct Civil Engn, Shanghai, Peoples R ChinaTongji Univ, Key Lab Geotech & Underground Engn, Minist Educ, Shanghai, Peoples R ChinaTongji Univ, Dept Geotech Engn, Shanghai, Peoples R ChinaChungbuk Natl Univ, Sch Civil Engn, Cheongju, South KoreaChinese Acad Sci, Inst Mech, Beijing, Peoples R China",,,,2019-03-19,WOS:000460709700041,,

At this stage of early industrial development the reliability assessment of MECs is a challenging task, and the reliability of MECs is critical to the success of the industry. In other industries, such as wind energy, it has been possible to build up the reliability of the systems in an onshore, relatively accessible environment, prior to moving offshore. However, for most MECs it is necessary to work in an inherently hostile, less accessible environment from the start. For the industry-leading prototypes being deployed now it is important to demonstrate appropriate levels of reliability as this is linked directly to their potential Cost of Energy (CoE). This means an accurate assessment of the reliability (and the associated uncertainty) of the system is extremely useful, if not essential. More mature industries, such as the offshore oil and gas sector, have dealt with the problem and developed new methods as it became more critical to them (in terms of reducing maintenance requirements and lost revenue due to downtime of installations), and have implemented databases of historical failure data, such as OREDA (SINTEF, 2002).Previous papers (Thies et al., 2009) have investigated the application of existing reliability methods to a notional configuration of MEC in order to investigate the effectiveness of current methods and applicability of available data. It was found that the lack of readily applicable failure rate data meant that crude adjustments to often generic data were necessary, and results obtained were rather unfavorable and highly uncertain. This paper will: present the problem in the context of the wave and tidal energy industry; discuss the benefits to be gained from assessing reliability using a transparent and standardized method; identify the challenges of presenting results with associated uncertainty; describe the initial work carried out on a method of dealing with the issues of lack of failure rate data and application of existing data to a novel technology in a new environment; and identify the work proposed to improve the assessment of reliability and availability in this industry through all stages of development of new devices.",,,,,11th International Conference on Applications of Statistics and Probability in Civil Engineering (IC ASP)11th International Conference on Applications of Statistics and Probability in Civil Engineering (IC ASP),"AUG 01-04, 2011AUG 01-04, 2011","BKW FMB Energie AG; Bundesamt Strassen ASTRA, Fed Roads Off; Walt Galmarini AG; Det Norske Veritas AS; ETH ZurichBKW FMB Energie AG; Bundesamt Strassen ASTRA, Fed Roads Off; Walt Galmarini AG; Det Norske Veritas AS; ETH Zurich","Zurich, SWITZERLANDZurich, SWITZERLAND",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,978-0-203-14479-4; 978-0-415-66986-3,,,,,,,,,"Det Norske Veritas, Loughborough, Leics, England",Det Norske Veritas,,,2011-01-01,WOS:000392245603036,,

However, the factors regulating carbon sinks in mangrove ecosystems are still unclear, particularly in the subtropical mangroves. The biomass, production, litterfall, detrital export and decomposition of the dominant mangrove vegetation in subtropical (Kandelia obovata) and tropical (Avicennia marina) Taiwan were quantified from October 2011 to July 2014 to construct the carbon budgets. Despite the different tree species, a principal component analysis revealed the site or environmental conditions had a greater influence than the tree species on the carbon processes. For both species, the net production (NP) rates ranged from 10.86 to 27.64MgCha(-1)year(-1) and were higher than the global average rate due to the high tree density. While most of the litterfall remained on the ground, a high percentage (72%-91%) of the ground litter decomposed within 1year and fluxed out of the mangroves. However, human activities might cause a carbon flux into the mangroves and a lower NP rate. The rates of the organic carbon export and soil heterotrophic respiration were greater than the global mean values and those at other locations. Only a small percentage (3%-12%) of the NP was stored in the sediment. The carbon burial rates were much lower than the global average rate due to their faster decomposition, indicating that decomposition played a critical role in determining the burial rate in the sediment. The summation of the organic and inorganic carbon fluxes and soil heterotrophic respiration well exceeded the amount of litter decomposition, indicating an additional source of organic carbon that was unaccounted for by decomposition in the sediment. Sediment-stable isotope analyses further suggest that the trapping of organic matter from upstream rivers or adjacent waters contributed more to the mangrove carbon sinks than the actual production of the mangrove trees.",,,,,,,,,49,4,0,0,34,0,54,,,1354-1013,1365-2486,,,,,,,,,,"Natl Chung Hsing Univ, Dept Life Sci & Innovat, Taichung 40227, TaiwanNatl Chung Hsing Univ, Dev Ctr Sustainable Agr, Taichung 40227, TaiwanEndem Species Res Inst, Chichi, TaiwanAcad Sinica, Biodivers Res Ctr, Taipei, Taiwan",Endem Species Res Inst,,,2018-12-28,WOS:000441746900026,29790233,

The spatiotemporal dynamics of the CBCS were then modeled and investigated by In-VEST based on the LULC transformation in relation to their driving processes. The results indicated that the CBCS in the YRD has been substantially altered by continuous LULC transformation driven by the natural and anthropogenic processes, totally decreased by 10.2% (1.63 x 10(6) Mg) during 1970-2010 followed the loss of 2028 km(2) natural wetlands converted to socioeconomic land use. The 78% of increased CBCS were contributed by single natural (e.g., succession) or anthropogenic (e.g., restoration) driving process at the seaward edge within tidal area, whereas 71% of decreased CBCS was linked with multiple driving processes in inland areas. In addition, the anthropogenic driving processes caused much greater loss (-5.97 x 10(5) Mg) than gain (6.81 x 10(4) Mg) in CBCS, compared with a net gain of CBCS (1.04 x 10(4) Mg) brought by the natural driving processes. The study can facilitate to develop coastal management strategy to balance and mitigate the conflicted LULC between socioeconomic development and maintenance of multiple ecosystem services incorporating CBCS.

Superconducting gravimeters (SGs), because of their high sensitivity, can enable continuous ground-based monitoring of offshore CO2 storage. For offshore monitoring purposes, gravity stations should be located near the seashore to maximize the signal of interest. We observed gravity continuously with an SG near the seashore at the Tomakomai carbon dioxide capture and storage demonstration site in Japan to assess variation of the observed gravity and to evaluate the applicability of this technique for monitoring of large-scale offshore storage. Strong noise caused by strong winds and ocean waves was removed by low-pass filtering. The noise did not fundamentally affect long-term gravity changes. The observed gravity was affected strongly by shallow groundwater level changes but the effects were sufficiently corrected by expressing their effects as a summation of linear functions of groundwater level changes. Considering all possible effects on gravity, the standard deviation of the gravity residuals during 85 days of observation was minimized to 7.5-8.2 nm s(-2). Based on the model setting of the Tomakomai site, the estimated annual gravity changes caused by industrial-scale injection (1 MtCO(2) year(-1)) into a hypothetical offshore formation (1 km depth) were -2.8 to -3.3 nm s(-2) under different saturation conditions. The estimated changes exceed the observed standard deviation in 2.3-2.9 years. These results suggest that injection-induced gravity changes can be detected using SG within a few years. Therefore, the present ground-based gravimetric technique can contribute to long-term monitoring of offshore storage.

The Fundy Ocean Research Center for Energy (FORCE) is a non-profit institute that owns and operates the facility that offers developers, regulators, scientists and academics the opportunity to study the performance and interaction of instream tidal energy converters (usually referred to as TISECs but called turbines in this paper.) with one of the world's most aggressive tidal regimes.FORCE provides a shared observation facility, submarine cables, grid connection, and environmental monitoring at its pre-approved test site. The site is well suited to testing, with water depths up to 45 meters at low tide, a sediment -free bedrock sea floor, straight flowing currents, and water speeds up to 5 meters per second (approximately 10 knots).FORCE will install 10.896km of double armored, 34.5kV submarine cable- one for each of its four berths. Electricity from the berths will be conditioned at FORCE's own substation and delivered to the Provincial power grid by a 10 km overhead transmission line. There are four berth holders at present: Alstom Hydro Canada using Clean Current Power Systems Technology (Canada); Minas Basin Pulp and Power Co. Ltd. with technology partner Marine Current Turbines (UK); Nova Scotia Power Inc. with technology partner Open Hydro (Ireland) and Atlantis Resources Corporation, in partnership with Lockheed Martin and Irving Shipbuilding. In November 2009, NSPI with technology partner Open Hydro deployed the first commercial scale turbine at the FORCE site. The 1MW rated turbine was secured by a 400-tonne subsea gravity base fabricated in Nova Scotia.The intent of this paper is to provide an overview of FORCE to the international marine energy community during OMAE 2011 taking place in Rotterdam, Netherlands.",,,,,"30th International Conference on Ocean, Offshore and Arctic Engineering30th International Conference on Ocean, Offshore and Arctic Engineering","JUN 19-24, 2011JUN 19-24, 2011","ASME, Ocean Offshore & Arctic Engn DivASME, Ocean Offshore & Arctic Engn Div","Rotterdam, NETHERLANDSRotterdam, NETHERLANDS",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,978-0-7918-4437-3,,,,,,,,,"Fundy Ocean Res Ctr Energy, Halifax, NS B3J 3N5, Canada",Fundy Ocean Res Ctr Energy,,,2011-01-01,WOS:000314736400046,,

Various techniques are available to assess how the industry can drive down its environmental impact and comply with environmental regulation. Environmental Assessments (EA) required by European law do not cover the whole life cycle of the project that they are analysing. Life Cycle Analysis (LCA) was developed to assess the environmental loadings of a product, process or activity over its entire life cycle. It was the first technique used in environmental analysis that adopted what was described as a holistic approach, It fails this approach by not assessing accidental emissions or environmental impacts other than those that are direct. Cost Benefit Analysis (CBA) offers the opportunity to value environmental effects and appraise a project on the basis of costs and benefits. Not all environmental effects can be valued and of those that can there is considerable uncertainty in their valuation and occurrence. CBA cannot satisfactorily measure the total environmental risk of a project. Consequently there is a need for a technique that overcomes the failures of project-level EA, LCA and CBA, and assesses total environmental risk. Many organizations such as, the British Medical Association, the European Oilfield Speciality Chemicals Association, the Royal ministry of Petroleum and Energy (Norway) and Shell Expro now recognize that a holistic approach is an integral part of assessing total risk. The Brent SPAR case study highlights the interdisciplinary nature required of any environmental analysis. Holistic Environmental Assessment is recommended as such an environmental analysis.

This powerful method provides information about diets over an extended time period (e.g., 2-4 weeks), rather than just the most recent meal as with most traditional approaches. Using consumer FA signatures, along with a comprehensive database of diet FA signatures, and accounting for consumer FA metabolism, it is possible to estimate the proportions of diet items in the consumer's diet using quantitative FA signature analysis (QFASA). However, before applying QFASA to free-ranging populations, ideally, controlled feeding studies are performed to determine FA deposition and turnover characteristics. We conducted feeding experiments to validate QFASA in captive spectacled eiders (Somateria fischeri) and Steller's eiders (Polysticta stelleri) as a minimally invasive method for studying the diets of these threatened species. We determined FA deposition in eider adipose tissue relative to long-term diet, and developed calibration coefficients (CCs) to account for eider lipid metabolism. Using these CCs with subsequent diet trials, QFASA accurately indicated diet and diet switches. QFASA estimates also indicated that turnover of dietary FAs was not complete by 21 or 29 days, and confirmed that diets could be estimated over an extended period of > 29 days. Thus, our understanding of diet can be backtracked to more than a month in captive feeding eiders. We conclude that applying QFASA techniques to eiders and other birds in the wild has the potential to provide valuable information about their diets at various life history stages.",,,,,,,,,45,0,0,0,43,0,58,,,0174-1578,1432-136X,,,,,,,,,,"Alaska SeaLife Ctr, Seward, AK 99664 USAUniv Alaska Fairbanks, Sch Fisheries & Ocean Sci, Seward, AK 99664 USADalhousie Univ, Dept Biol, Halifax, NS B3H 4J1, Canada",Alaska SeaLife Ctr,,,2010-01-01,WOS:000273175200012,19652982,

Pipeline transportation of CO2 is considered the most feasible and viable option for achieving this. However, in carbon capture and storage applications, there is concern about associated impurities and huge volumes of high pressure CO2 to be transported over distances that will likely be densely populated areas. On this basis, there is limited experience for design and economic assessment of CO2 pipeline. The Humber region in the UK is a likely site for building CO2 pipelines in the future due to large CO2 emissions in the region and its close access to depleted gas fields and saline aquifers beneath the North Sea. In this paper, various issues to be considered in CO2 pipeline design for carbon capture and storage applications are discussed. Also, different techno-economic correlations for CO2 pipelines are assessed using the Humber region as a case study.

The entire Tertiary succession, nearly 10,000 m thick, has undergone inversion here. The succession is composed mainly of sandstones and mudstones with minor coals and non-marine limestones. Hydrocarbons are present in a series of structural traps which formed as a result of inversion-related deformation. Oil and gas exploration in the Xihu Depressions has demonstrated that at least 90% of the commercial reserves so far found occur in inversion-related structural traps in the central inversion zone, mainly in Eocene (Pinghu Formation) and Oligocene (Huagang Formation) sandstone reservoirs. Previous studies have shown that structural traps are controlled by the intensity and style of inversion tectonics. However, the relationship between the geometry, kinematics and size of the inversion structures and the oil and gas accumulations is not well understood.In this paper, the factors controlling trap formation (and hydrocarbon acumulations) in the study area are considered. Data came from 2D reflection seismic and electic logs from a number of wells. Controlling factors include inversion fault activity rate, inversion rate and the thickness of sediments eroded as a result of inversion-related uplift of the Tertiary succession. The results show that the best exploration targets are located in the southern part of the central inversion zone. This area has a relatively low inversion fault activity rate (average 3.0 m/Ma) and a low inversion rate (average 0.4); a relatively small thickness of sediments was eroded from the Miocene Longjing and Liulang Formations (< 400 m) and the Eocene Pinghu Formation. By contrast, the northern part of the central inversion zone has a relatively high inversion fault activity rate (average 6.8 m/Ma) and a high inversion rate (0.8), and greater thicknesses of sediments were erosively removed (up to 1600 m). This may have resulted in the less favourable preservation of traps and the large-scale leakage of oil and gas. Most oil and gas accumulations occur in the southern part of the central inversion zone, especially in reservoirs in the Longjing, Liulang and Pinghu Formations.",,,,,,,,,25,5,0,0,0,0,29,,,0141-6421,,,,,,,,,,,"Tongji Univ, Sch Ocean & Earth Sci, Shanghai 200092, Peoples R China",,,,2011-10-12,WOS:000295094300005,,

We assessed the relative performance of three Podocarpaceae (podocarps) species planted into a degraded Ponderosa Pine (Pinus ponderosa) plantation, central North Island, New Zealand. We hypothesised that the degraded pine plantation overstorey could provide suitable conditions for the development of a podocarp-dominated forest structure within ca. 50years of underplanting and that podocarp growth would differ depending on the species suitability to the site. Rimu (Dacrydium cupressinum) significantly outperformed both Totara (Podocarpus totara) and Kahikatea (Dacrycarpus dacrydioides) in height and diameter growth. Rimu was now the structurally dominant tree where it occurred rather than pine. Per annum scaled carbon storage within Rimu stands was significantly greater than the Totara, Kahikatea or Pine stands. All podocarp species had attained a greater stand density compared to the pine overstorey. Possible reasons for the differing podocarp growth performance include different light requirements, response to soil nutrients, elevational distributions and frost susceptibility. There were significant differences in understorey species richness among the different stands of podocarp species.

We developed a Bayesian network model to evaluate the relative influence of environmental and anthropogenic stressors, and their mitigation, on the persistence of polar bears (Ursus maritimus). Overall sea ice conditions, affected by rising global temperatures, were the most influential determinant of population outcomes. Accordingly, unabated rise in atmospheric greenhouse gas (GHG) concentrations was the dominant influence leading to worsened population outcomes, with polar bears in three of four ecoregions reaching a dominant probability of decreased or greatly decreased by the latter part of this century. Stabilization of atmospheric GHG concentrations by mid-century delayed the greatly reduced state by [approximately equal]25 yr in two ecoregions. Prompt and aggressive mitigation of emissions reduced the probability of any regional population becoming greatly reduced by up to 25%. Marine prey availability, linked closely to sea ice trend, had slightly less influence on outcome state than sea ice availability itself. Reduced mortality from hunting and defense of life and property interactions resulted in modest declines in the probability of a decreased or greatly decreased population outcome. Minimizing other stressors such as trans-Arctic shipping, oil and gas exploration, and contaminants had a negligible effect on polar bear outcomes, although the model was not well-informed with respect to the potential influence of these stressors. Adverse consequences of loss of sea ice habitat became more pronounced as the summer ice-free period lengthened beyond four months, which could occur in most of the Arctic basin after mid-century if GHG emissions are not promptly reduced. Long-term conservation of polar bears would be best supported by holding global mean temperature to <= 2[degree]C above preindustrial levels. Until further sea ice loss is stopped, management of other stressors may serve to slow the transition of populations to progressively worsened outcomes, and improve the prospects for their long-term persistence.",,,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,1,0,2,,,2150-8925; 2150-8925,,,,,,,,,,,"US Geol Survey, Alaska Sci Ctr, Anchorage, AK, 99508, USA",,,,2016-10-27,ZOOREC:ZOOR15211070015,,

We assessed the aboveground carbon stocks and plant densities along a grazing gradient in the semi-arid seasonally dry tropical forest of north-eastern Brazil (Caatinga). On 45 study plots, we analysed the aboveground carbon stocks of the vegetation and determined forest density and recruitment as well as the population structure of the most abundant tree species.

Mean aboveground carbon stock was 15.74 +/- 1.92 Mg ha(-1) with trees and shrubs accounting for 89% of the total amount. Grazing at high intensities significantly reduced aboveground carbon stocks of herbs but not of other plant functional types. Instead, aboveground carbon stocks of trees and shrubs were negatively related to altitude above sea level, which is a proxy for reduced water availability along with lower anthropogenic impact. The population structure of the most common tree species was characterised by abundant recruitment, irrespective of grazing, whereas the recruitment of less frequent woody species was negatively affected by grazing. Overall, our data imply that grazing and forage management need to be adapted, including the reduction of free-roaming livestock and storage of fodder, to maintain carbon storage and forest density.",,,,,,,,,15,0,0,0,9,0,15,,,1436-3798,1436-378X,,,,,,,,,,"Tech Univ Berlin, Dept Ecol, Ecosyst Sci Plant Ecol, Rothenburgstr 12, D-12165 Berlin, GermanySenckenberg Nat Hist Collect Dresden, Museum Zool, Konigsbrucker Landstr 159, D-01109 Dresden, GermanyBerlin Brandenburg Inst Adv Biodivers Res BBIB, D-14195 Berlin, GermanyUniv Fed Pernambuco, Ctr Biociencias, Dept Bot, Av Prof Moraes Rego 1235 Cidade Univ, BR-50670901 Recife, PE, BrazilUniv Fed Pernambuco, Ctr Tecnol & Geociencias, Dept Energia Nucl, Av Prof Luiz Freire 1000 Cidade Univ, BR-50740545 Recife, PE, Brazil",Berlin Brandenburg Inst Adv Biodivers Res BBIB,,,2018-12-28,WOS:000445234600008,,

The artificial substrata studied were the horizontal sides of a model of an artificial reef. This had been immersed at a depth of 11 m on a muddy sandy bottom, near the Marine Biology Laboratory (Trieste), since May 1988. To record periphyton colonization by phytosociological monthly sampling, the surfaces examined were subdivided into 44 squares of 20 X 20 cm. Temperature and salinity data were recorded twice a month by means of a computerized core-drill; sea water transparency by means of a Secchi disc. The ecological relationships, highlighted by multivariate analysis, among processes of colonization and physical parameter showed that the difference between surface-bottom temperature (thermocline) together with reduction in transparency acted synergically and interfered with the development processes of the periphyton.",,,,,,,,,3,0,0,0,4,0,4,,,0007-4977,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1994-09-01,WOS:A1994QB58400053,,

The first applied SEA to a plan for a liquefied natural gas hub precinct on the National Heritage listed Kimberley coast of Western Australia, and the second applies SEA to a coastal management, planning and development framework for the World Heritage listed Great Barrier Reef on the coast of Queensland. Both cases illustrate the approach of the Australian governments to SEA, highlighting the benefits of the approach yet certain flaws in application and process. The research consists of an extensive evaluation of the relevant legislation, its application and reform, together with a thorough literature review. Results highlight concerns in relation to the objective of SEA in Australia, its initiation and timing, consideration of alternatives, and governance. Conclusions are that SEA in Australia will be enhanced if the purpose is more explicitly focused on environmental protection, if SEA is applied early to a reasonable range of alternative sites, and if the Australian Government continues to play an active role in relation to matters of national environmental significance.",,,,,,,,,7,0,0,0,0,1,7,,,1464-3332,1757-5605,,,,,,,,,,"Flinders Univ S Australia, Sch Law, GPO Box 2100, Adelaide, SA 5001, Australia",,,,2013-09-01,BCI:BCI201400742114,,

It is used in various applications, including the transfer of cargo between two vessels in the open ocean, installation of topsides of an offshore structure, offshore drilling and for surveillance, reconnaissance and monitoring. These applications typically involve a load suspended from a hydraulically powered winch that is connected to a vessel that is undergoing dynamic motion in the ocean environment. The goal in these applications is to design a winch controller to keep the load at a regulated height by rejecting the net heave motion of the winch arising from ship motions at sea. In this study, we analyze and compare the performance of various control algorithms in stabilizing a suspended load while the vessel is subjected to changing sea conditions. The KCS container ship is chosen as the vessel undergoing dynamic motion in the ocean. The negative of the net heave motion at the winch is provided as a reference signal to track. Various control strategies like Proportional-Derivative (PD) Control, Model Predictive Control (MPC), Linear Quadratic Integral Control (LQI), and Sliding Mode Control (SMC) are implemented and tuned for effective heave compensation. The performance of the controllers is compared with respect to heave compensation, disturbance rejection and noise attenuation.",,,,,,,,,4,2,0,0,0,0,5,,,2093-6702,2093-677X,,,,,,,,,,"Indian Inst Technol Madras, Dept Ocean Engn, Chennai, Tamil Nadu, India",,,,2021-02-09,WOS:000609258800002,,
