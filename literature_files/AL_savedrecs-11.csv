In order to detect the oil slick, and to measure its extent and geo-location, we present a methodology based on the use of SAR images and of stochastic process theory. The task of scene interpretation makes use of pixel potential functions supported by the Ising model. The scheme is applied to an ASAR image of the Gulf of Mexico, at the time when the DWH oil spill had already completely developed.

The particular focus of the system will be to monitor thestator insulation condition of the HV motors located in 'Ex' (explosive environment) whichpump and process the oil & gas in the facilities. The technology developed will be suitable forboth offshore drilling platforms and onshore processing facilities, targeting an unmet sectorneed for a 'Complete HV Network PD Condition Monitoring System'.The potential market opportunity for the technology is significant, the North Sea oil and gasfields alone represent a potential market of £30 Million of product sales with up to £3 Millionper year in service fees with the worldwide market conservatively estimated at 1 0x this(£300M product sales, £30M service fees p.a).The benefits of the proposed Central PD monitoring solution range from improved assetavailability, increased production, to the significant reduction of energy consumption. Theoutcome of HV plant insulation failure can leads to serious consequences including cost,safety and social-economic implications. The central monitoring solution will thus be used byasset managers to improve the reliability and availability of their HV networks whilstmaximising the useful service life of the plant leading to considerable savings of life cyclecosts.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,710151,,,,,,,,High Voltage Partial Discharge Limited,High Voltage Partial Discharge Limited,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:15401301,,

Here, we studied the effects of invasion and ecological replacement using S. apetala on soil organic carbon fractions and stock on Qi'ao Island. Materials and Methods: Seven sites, including unvegetated mudflat and S. alterniflora, rehabilitated mangroves with different ages (one, six, and 10 years) and mature native Kandelia obovata Sheue, Liu, and Yong areas were selected in this study. Samples in the top 50 cm of soil were collected and then different fractions of organic carbon, including the total organic carbon (TOC), particulate organic carbon (POC), soil water dissolved carbon (DOC) and microbial biomass carbon (MBC), and the total carbon stock were measured and calculated. Results: The growth of S. alterniflora and mangroves significantly increased the soil TOC, POC, and MBC levels when compared to the mudflat. S. alterniflora had the highest soil DOC contents at 0-10 cm and 20-30 cm and the one-year restored mangroves had the highest MBC content. S. alterniflora and mangroves both had higher soil total carbon pools than the mudflat. Conclusions: The invasive S. alterniflora and young S. apetala forests had significantly lower soil TOC and POC contents and total organic carbon than the mature K. obovata on Qi'ao Island.

The structural-sedimentary and reservoir characteristics are discussed and helpful conclusions are drawn. It was proved that there are mainly two reservoir and capping assemblages in Qiongdongnan basin by drilled wells, i.e., one assemblage of the second and the third members of Lingshui (e (TM)mu ae degrees ') Formation, upper Sanya (a parts per thousand a(0)e) and Meishan (ae cent...a +/-+/-) formations. According to hydrocarbon evaluation from burial history and well data, all source rocks in Yacheng (a '-aYZ) and Lingshui formations have reached the mature-overmature stage. High temperature and overpressure provide dynamic conditions for oil and gas migration, while the long-term activity of basin controlling faults is adverse to their accumulation in upheaved areas. However, because the secondary faults in the basin ceased their activities at the end of the Sanya Period, and the Sanya Formation was later covered by the regional overlying layer of the Meishan Formation, the blocks and low uplifts near the secondary faults were favorable for oil and gas accumulation. Furthermore, as another important pointed area for gas migration, the highest position of a structural ridge should reasonably be a range that is covered by marine mudstone or sandy mudstone during the whole subsiding period, and therefore, the reservoir bed should not be in that position but at its inferior eminence or adjacent slope zone. Therefore, we can draw a conclusion that the inferior low uplifts and structural ridges rather than the upheavals or the top of a structural ridge, probably, have huge reservoirs, and should be chief exploration targets in the Qiongdongnan basin.",,,,,,,,,4,3,0,0,0,0,6,,,1674-487X,1867-111X,,,,,,,,,,"China Natl Offshore Oil Corp Ltd, Zhanjiang 524057, Peoples R ChinaS China Univ Technol, Sch Chem & Chem Engn, Guangzhou 510640, Peoples R China",,,,2009-10-01,WOS:000271536300004,,

Three central questions arise when dealing with shipwrecks; Who is responsible? What measures can and are to be taken based on such a responsibility? And lastly; how can the responsibility be enforced? The Nairobi Convention on the Removal of Wrecks addresses these questions. The registered owner of a ship bears strict liability according to the convention but can be exonerated by certain limited defenses. Measures that are to be taken include locating, marking, and subsequently removing the wreck. The onus to remove the wreck is on the registered owner, but there are also options available for the State affected by the wreck should the registered owner not cooperate or be unable to contact. Finally the convention strives to ensure enforceability by compulsory insurance for ships, wherever registered, with a gross tonnage of 300 tons and above calling any port or offshore facility in a State Party. The convention also enables an Affected State to claim the insurer directly. This article will analyze the convention by the use of the convention text, its preparatory works and legal writing. The article suggests that even though the convention provides a unified framework for wreck removal, it has inclusions that may actually inhibit harmonization. The convention is also in part unclear and ambiguous. Despite this the article concludes in the convention being a natural step forward in unifying the regulation of wrecks and providing a platform to deal with wreck removal in the future.",,,,,,,,,2,0,0,0,1,0,2,,,,2296-7745,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Gothenburg, Dept Law, Sch Business Econ & Law, Gothenburg, Sweden",,,,2016-01-01,WOS:000457358000011,,

The effects, both in magnitude and direction, of UVB radiation on trace-gas emissions and mineral nutrient cycling are species specific and operate on a number of processes. These processes include changes in the chemical composition in living plant tissue, photodegradation (breakdown by light) of dead plant matter, including Litter, release of carbon monoxide from vegetation previously charred by fire, changes in the communities of microbial decomposers, and effects on nitrogen-fixing microorganism and plants. Long-term experiments are in place to examine UV-B effects on carbon capture and storage in biomass within natural terrestrial ecosystems. Studies in natural aquatic ecosystems have indicated that organic matter is the primary regulator of UV-B penetration. Changes in the organic matter, caused by enhanced UV-B reinforced by changes in climate and acidification, result in clarification of the water and changes in light quality that have broad impacts on the effects of enhanced UV-B on aquatic biogeochemical cycles. Increased UV-B has positive and negative impacts on microbial activity in aquatic ecosystems that can affect carbon and mineral nutrient cycling as well as the uptake and release of greenhouse and chemically reactive gases. Photoinhibition of surface aquatic microorganisms by UV-B can be partially offset by photodegradation of dissolved organic matter to produce substrates, such as organic acids and ammonium, that stimulate microbial activity. Modeling and experimental approaches are being developed to predict and measure the interactions and feedbacks between climate change and W-B-induced changes in marine and terrestrial biogeochemical cycles. These interactions include alterations in the oxidative environment in the upper ocean and in the marine boundary layer and oceanic production and release of CO, volatile organic compounds (VOC), and reactive oxygen species (ROS, such as hydrogen peroxide and hydroxyl radicals). Climate-related changes in temperature and water supply in terrestrial ecosystems interact with UV-B radiation through biogeochemical processes operating on a wide range of time scales.

Triassic sedimentation in western Canada was centred on four basins or subbasins: the extensional or transtensional Peace River Basin, the transtensional Liard Basin, an unnamed continental margin sag basin. and the Williston Basin. This paper covers only the Peace River Basin and its western extension into the continental margin sag basin.The Triassic basin occupied a midlatitudinal, west-facing position on the western margin of the Supercontinent Pangea. In this setting, climatic aridity, influence of prevailing northeast trade winds, offshore coastal upwelling, and other conditions resulted in Limited fluvial influx, dominantly fine-grained siliciclastic sedimentation, significant aeolian processes, low-productivity carbonate shelves and ramps, extensive evaporites, and early-diagenetic dolomitization. Underlying Devonian reefs, reactivation of graben fault systems in the Peace River area, localized Paleozoic highs, and other tectonic elements, exerted strong influence on Triassic basin topography and facies, including localization of sediment gravity flows and turbidites. Collectively, these tectonic, paleogeographic and paleoclimatic conditions in western Canada in Triassic time have left a relatively unique sedimentological record with a wide range of facies and reservoir types.Ongoing discoveries of gas in Upper Triassic carbonates in northeastern British Columbia, new discoveries and extensions of play trends in the Lower Triassic in Alberta, and ongoing exploration in Middle Triassic units in both areas, are contributing to the growing reserves of oil and gas in the Triassic of western Canada. An understanding of some of the unique or different sedimentological aspects of the Triassic, as reflected by its tectonic setting, paleogeography and paleoclimate, is a necessary step in evaluating its reservoir potential.",,,,,,,,,81,0,0,0,9,0,90,,,0007-4802,,,,,,,,,,,"Graham Davies Geol Consultants Ltd, Calgary Adv Technol Ctr 120, Calgary, AB T2L 2K7, Canada",Graham Davies Geol Consultants Ltd,,,1997-12-01,WOS:000071755800004,,

A key indicator of exposure to such risk is a company's Social License to Operate (SLO). If a company meets its consumer, shareholders and other stakeholders' expectations regarding environmental management, it can gain a SLO. The SLO is an implicit contract between parties which reduces the risk of socio-political challenges to the actions of the company. Here, we apply this concept to a case study of the oil and gas sector in Western Australia, where we evaluate the strength of the SLO granted by the West Australian population to this industry. Our results suggest that, on average, people are not likely to oppose oil and gas projects, because they are economically beneficial for the State. However, it does not achieve as high an evaluation on social legitimacy. We subsequently examine whether the use of marine biodiversity offsets by the oil and gas sector influences SLO. This serves to clarify the social acceptability of offsets as tools to protect the environment. We find that the use of marine biodiversity offsets would improve the SLO of the sector.

They are primarily horizontal steel pipe laying on, near or beneath to the seabed. Usually, a subsea pipeline is used to transport gas or oil from a satellite subsea well to a manifold as well as in the transferring process of the petroleum production from the offshore facility to onshore installations. Frequently this pipeline is buried in the seabed, and sometimes it passes over uneven seafloor creating free-span lengths. The pipeline structure will need to withstand environmental forces caused by soil, current and waves. In the free spanning portion, for the in-line direction, which is defined as the direction parallel to the ocean current flow direction, drag and lift effects usually are present. The cross-flow, or cross-flow direction, the presence of vortex induced vibrations (VIV) forces and self-weight are observed. Free-span lengths of pipeline can be a concern to the overall pipeline system due to material fatigue resulting from induced dynamic behavior. Previous investigations have shown that vortex induced vibrations are important element in the reduction of life-time service due to fatigue. In the present work, hydrodynamic forces are calculated by a semi-empirical formulation based on the Morison type equations, for inline and cross-flow directions. Ocean current and wave forces are considered for calculations of the free spanning pipeline behavior. Fluid particle velocity and acceleration are calculated based on the 5(th) order Strokes and Airy wave theory. The pipeline is modeled as an Euter-Bernoulli beam. Different boundary conditions have been investigated in the present study and the results arediscussed. Discussions are carried out in terms of the behavior of the free-spanning pipeline, through time domain simulations.",,,,,26th International Conference on Offshore Mechanics and Arctic Engineering26th International Conference on Offshore Mechanics and Arctic Engineering,"JUN 10-15, 2007JUN 10-15, 2007",,"San Diego, CASan Diego, CA",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,978-0-7918-4269-0,,,,,,,,,"Univ Estadual Campinas, Dept Petr Engn, Sao Paulo, Brazil",,,,2007-01-01,WOS:000249558900018,,

They are identified as one of the terrestrial ecosystems most vulnerable to global environmental change. Despite their vulnerability, and the importance for regional biodiversity conservation and socio-economic development, they are among the least studied and described ecosystems in the world. This paper reviews the state of knowledge about tropical alpine environments, and provides an integrated assessment of the potential threats of global climate change on the major ecosystem processes.LocationHumid tropical alpine regions occur between the upper forest line and the perennial snow border in the upper regions of the Andes, the Afroalpine belt and Indonesia and Papua New Guinea.Results and main conclusionsClimate change will displace ecosystem boundaries and strongly reduce the total area of tropical alpine regions. Displacement and increased isolation of the remaining patches will induce species extinction and biodiversity loss. Drier and warmer soil conditions will cause a faster organic carbon turnover, decreasing the below-ground organic carbon storage. Since most of the organic carbon is currently stored in the soils, it is unlikely that an increase in above-ground biomass will be able to offset soil carbon loss at an ecosystem level. Therefore a net release of carbon to the atmosphere is expected. Changes in precipitation patterns, increased evapotranspiration and alterations of the soil properties will have a major impact on water supply. Many regions are in danger of a significantly reduced or less reliable stream flow. The magnitude and even the trend of most of these effects depend strongly on local climatic, hydrological and ecological conditions. The extreme spatial gradients in these conditions put the sustainability of ecosystem management at risk.",,,,,,,,,252,3,0,0,161,18,294,,,1466-822X,1466-8238,,,,,,,,,,"Univ London Imperial Coll Sci Technol & Med, London SW7 2AZ, EnglandConsortium Sustainable Dev Andean Ecoreg CONDESAN, Quito, EcuadorUniv Nacl Colombia Con Sede Medellin, Medellin, Colombia",Consortium Sustainable Dev Andean Ecoreg CONDESANUniv Nacl Colombia Con Sede Medellin,,,2011-01-01,WOS:000285109200002,,

The ability of the OOC Model to predict the plume characteristics observed in numerous individual tests of plume behavior covering a wide range of discharge conditions was examined. Data are provided summarizing the predictive ability of the model for all tests. The dimensionless parameters describing the physical characteristics of the plumes were within the range expected for typical Gulf of Mexico produced water and drilling fluid discharges for most of the comparisons. The model was in good to excellent agreement with measurements of plume behavior under most discharge conditions. The model was less accurate for those experimental cases where extreme plume bending occurred. It is believed that turbulence caused by the discharge pipe itself influenced the behavior of these extreme-bending plumes. The predicted density of solids accumulation on the bottom of a towing tank, a lab-scale analogy of the seabed accumulation of drilling solids, was within a factor of two of experimental observations. Excluding the three simulations of extreme bending plumes, the model showed no systematic trend towards either under- or over-estimation of any parameter examined. This suggests that experimental errors or biases may have contributed to observed differences between predictions and observations. The results of the validation testing described in this report increases confidence in the use of OOC Model predictions as an alternative to the difficult and expensive process of performing field measurements for every practical discharge situation.

This study was undertaken to better understand oil and gas compositional histories in HPHT hydrocarbon systems and to help identify new exploration opportunities.The Late Jurassic Kimmeridge Clay Formation has been the source for both oil and gas over the entire area, with additional gas charge from the humic coals of the Middle Jurassic Pentland Formation in the western graben areas. The southern For-ties Montrose high, with its southward-plunging Mesozoic terraces, is host to numerous oil and gas fields with temperatures ranging from 90 to 180degreesC and formation pressures whose gradient to the surface exceeds 0.8 psi/ft (0.192 MPa/m). Several of these oil accumulations have undergone in-reservoir thermal cracking, resulting in a lighter, single-phase fluid, together with a pyrobitumen residue in the pore volumes. With several traps at or near their leak-off pressure, the likelihood of top seal failure and gas leakage is prevalent. Such top seal failure is intermittent and, in some instances, is associated with gas chimneys. The main causes of pressure increase in Mesozoic sediments are thought to be volume increases associated with gas generation from source rocks, clay dehydration, and thermal cracking of oil. Top seal failure because of pressure buildup by salt diapirism and the buoyancy of large hydrocarbon columns has resulted in a series of compositionally fractionated oils and gases. A new technique is presented, whereby the geochemical character of a shallow (Tertiary) oil reservoir that has undergone fractionation can help lower the risk of detecting the presence of hydrocarbon at depth in potential, deep (Mesozoic) reservoirs.",,,,,Annual Meeting of the AAPGAnnual Meeting of the AAPG,"APR 16-19, 2000APR 16-19, 2000",AAPGAAPG,"New Orleans, LANew Orleans, LA",80,20,1,0,2,0,98,,,0149-1423,1558-9153,,,,,,,,,,"ExxonMobil Explorat Co, Houston, TX 77210 USA",,,,2004-11-01,WOS:000224947600005,,

The open source Delft3D flow model is used. Hydrodynamics of a regional Pentland Firth model provided the boundary conditions for a high resolution local scale model of the Inner Sound sub-channel, an area favoured for in-stream tidal turbines deployment. Investigation of the dynamics of substantial sandbanks located in this region during two spring-neap tidal cycles, under a 'no-energy' extraction scenario, showed that they are highly dynamic and their existence and integrity highly depends on the local flow regime. It is found that the observed tidal asymmetry along with the less significant secondary flows due to the curvature of the flow mainly contribute to the maintenance mechanisms of the sandbanks. Following that, the current model set up was used to investigate the impacts of tidal current turbines on sea bed dynamics. A range of energy extraction scenarios and array configurations was selected and modelled to map notable relationships between the altered currents and seabed changes.",,,,,36th IAHR World Congress36th IAHR World Congress,"JUN 28-JUL 03, 2015JUN 28-JUL 03, 2015","Int Assoc Hydro Environm Engn & Res; Boskalis; Van Oord; UNESCO IHE; Delft Univ Technol; Deltares; Minist Infrastructure & Environm, Rijkswaterstaat; Royal HaskoningDHV; ARCADIS; WItteveen Bos; AANDERAA; Prince Sultan Bin Abulaziz Int Prize WaterInt Assoc Hydro Environm Engn & Res; Boskalis; Van Oord; UNESCO IHE; Delft Univ Technol; Deltares; Minist Infrastructure & Environm, Rijkswaterstaat; Royal HaskoningDHV; ARCADIS; WItteveen Bos; AANDERAA; Prince Sultan Bin Abulaziz Int Prize Water","Delft, NETHERLANDSDelft, NETHERLANDS",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,978-90-824846-0-1,,,,,,,,,"Swansea Univ, Coll Engn, Energy & Environm Res Grp, Swansea, W Glam, Wales",,,,2015-01-01,WOS:000398996207041,,

A selection of cross-sectoral development scenarios, management strategies and computer representations, provided by the relevant interest groups, is represented. These include prospective future sectoral activities and their impacts, and the sectoral response to alternative management policies and strategies. The agent-based modelling software InVitro is well placed for analysing prospective social and ecological impacts of multiple-use management strategies in a risk-assessment framework such as MSE. An illustrative example is provided to demonstrate the tradeoffs that can be recognised and quantified using the MSE framework.

Underwater noise is increasingly recognized as a source of impact on the marine environment and seismic airguns were one of the first man-made high intensity sound source to receive attention with respect to potential impact on marine mammals. In this study, we investigate the effects of a 3D seismic survey on harbor porpoise echolocation activity in the Danish sector of the North Sea. This was achieved by deploying porpoise click detectors (C-PODs) and sound recorders (SM2M and SM3M) both inside and adjacent to the seismic survey area, before, during and after the survey over a total duration of 9 months. Three echolocation parameters were analyzed: number of clicks per minute, minutes with porpoise echolocation click trains and feeding buzz frequency in relation to all minutes with click trains. Decreases in echolocation signals were detected up to 8-12 km from the active airguns, which may indicate temporary displacement of porpoises or a change in porpoise echolocation behavior. However, no general displacement of harbor porpoises away from the seismic survey area could be detected when comparing to reference stations 15 km away from any seismic activity. Our results add to the understanding that underwater noise has the potential to affect temporarily foraging efficiency in porpoises. While the effect of seismic surveys on harbor porpoise behavior was smaller than what has been found for piledriving, the cumulative effect of anthropogenic impacts could be assessed by evaluation of potential population level consequences.",,,,,,,,,15,0,0,0,15,0,15,,,,2296-7745,,,,,,,,,,"Aarhus Univ, Marine Mammal Res, Dept Biosci, Roskilde, DenmarkTotal E&P Denmark, Hlth Safety & Environm, Esbjerg, Denmark",Total E&P Denmark,,,2020-01-29,WOS:000507985800001,,

Shifts in timing and magnitude of freeze-thaw processes are observed to have or expected to have non-linear, threshold-crossing impacts on sea ice, landforms, and biota. Observed changes in North Slope surface air temperatures and precipitation were non-monotonic over the last century, but have trended upward for the last several decades. These changes are linked to hemispheric climate dynamics, reflected in North Pacific and Arctic Oscillation circulation indices. Projected anthropogenic climate changes-with the possibility of continued warming, increased storm frequency and intensity, and decreased insulating snow cover-portend an uncertain future for this domain. Current or foreseen physical system shifts include: (1) declining seasonal and permanent sea ice extent and character, (2) rapid coastal erosion due to storm exposure over a longer near-shore ice-free season, (3) deeper soil active layer over warmer permafrost, along with altered thermokarst processes-contributing to thaw lake expansion, surface drainage re-organization, and hillslope instability. Biogeophysical responses encompass (1) modified surface-atmosphere energy balance from snow cover, vegetation, and hydrologic change and (2) shifted soil and wetland biogeochemical dynamics, including accelerated carbon efflux. Climate-driven plant community shifts on the North Slope result from the interplay of climate, vegetation response, and landscape processes. Some transitions involve stabilizing, others destabilizing plant-permafrost feedbacks. Impacts on caribou, migratory avifauna, and freshwater biota are through direct effects of climate on organism physiology and reproductive biology and indirectly through disruption of habitat mosaics (including along migratory routes) and shifts in competition and trophic linkages. The North Slope's physical and biological vulnerabilities to shifting climate and observed leading indicators of change are compelling reasons for land managers to consider climatic instability as a threat in conjunction with other known stressors while seeking strategies for protection of this domain's natural heritage and ecosystem services.",,,,,,,,,32,0,0,0,19,0,41,,,1436-3798,1436-378X,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Colorado, Inst Arctic & Alpine Res, Boulder, CO 80309 USANature Conservancy, Moab, UT USAColorado State Univ, Nat Resource Ecol Lab, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USANature Conservancy, Chicago, IL USADefenders Wildlife, Washington, DC USA",Nature ConservancyDefenders Wildlife,,,2011-03-01,WOS:000287596600024,,

The available marine biodiversity data in Iran are sparse and abandoned on libraries' shelves and, as such, accessing relevant and reliable current information about the status of Iranian southern seas biodiversity is challenging. Therefore, there is an urgent need to extract, standardize, and evaluate these biodiversity data. A comprehensive review of the available biodiversity data on the Iranian southern seas provided an estimate about the species diversity and highlighted the amount of reliable biodiversity data, research gaps, and required information for the lesser-known areas. In the present review, the available biodiversity data records of the Persian Gulf and the Gulf of Oman under Iranian ownership was extracted from non-database information sources (books, theses, research reports, and articles) and open-access database portals, such as the Ocean Biogeographic Information System (OBIS), Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF, 10.15468/dl.jm7hat), and those museum collections with online portal data collection search facilities. In total, 59,745 biodiversity records were extracted from all information sources. After data standardization based on the OBIS data scheme (Darwin core format), eight criteria with 29 sub-criteria were considered and scored to measure the validity of each record. Consequently, the presence of 3364 valid species (more than twice the number predicted earlier for the total species diversity) was reported for the study area. Describing new species shows an increasing trend, as most of the 80 new species until the beginning of 2018 were described recently. Mollusca phylum had the most amount of synonymy in non-database information sources. The results show that some marine taxa have been ignored in previous studies and the focus was on a certain group of organisms. Multi-criteria scoring analysis shows that 6% of the extracted biodiversity data for non-database information sources have 75-100% credit (valid), 70% have 50-75% credit (semi-valid), 23.4% have 25-50% credit (a little valid), and 0.9% have 0-25% credit (invalid). On the other hand, OBIS data extracted for Iran do not have invalid data due to its good data quality control, but 58 and 20% of its extracted data are semi-valid and valid, respectively. We believe that all of the eight mentioned criteria are required for reporting biodiversity data, and our proposed weighting system helps different users who need to know how reliable is the published data.",,,,,,,,,7,0,0,0,7,0,7,,,1867-1616,1867-1624,,,,,,,,,,"INIOAS, Tehran, IranUniv Tehran, Coll Sci, Sch Biol, Tehran, IranUniv Tehran, Coll Sci, Ctr Excellence Phylogeny Living Organisms, Tehran, IranIran Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Math, Dept Appl Math, Tehran, Iran",INIOAS,,,2019-04-19,WOS:000463684600001,,

The Department of the Interior's Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, Regulation and Enforcement (BOEMRE) plays a significant role in the Nation's efforts to gain energy independence by providing access to the federal Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) for responsible development of energy and mineral resources that realizes a fair return to the American people. However, the technology for harnessing these renewable resources to produce energy, as well as knowledge of the potential environmental impacts of these devices, is still in its early stages of development, with great need for additional research. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 provided the Secretary of the Interior with the authority to administer OCS renwable energy activities (i.e. production, transportation, or transmission of energy from sources other than oil and gas) not otherwise authorized by existing law. The Secretary delegated this authority to the Minerals Management Service (now BOEMRE). In April of 2009, final regulations were published in the Federal Register that established a program for granting leases, easements, and rights-of-way for renewable energy activities on the OCS. The regulations authorize BOEMRE to issue research leases and grants on the OCS for research supporting future renewable energy development. These research leases can only be held by a federal agency or a state and can only be issued in areas where there is no commercial interest in renewable energy development. This paper describes opportunities for obtaining OCS research leases, particularly in Hawaii, and outlines the process under the BOEMRE regulations for issuing research leases.",,,,,MTS/IEEE OCEANS ConferenceMTS/IEEE OCEANS Conference,"SEP 19-22, 2011SEP 19-22, 2011",Marine Technol Soc (MTS); IEEE; OESMarine Technol Soc (MTS); IEEE; OES,"Kona, HIKona, HI",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,978-0-933957-39-8,,,,,,,,,"US Dept Interior, Bur Ocean Energy Management Regulat & Enforcement, Camarillo, CA USA",,,,2012-03-21,WOS:000299005801186,,

Artificial upwelling as the ecological engineering can mix surface water with bottom water and bring rich nutrients to the euphotic zone, enhance seaweed growth in the oligotrophic sea area, and then increase coastal carbon sequestration. However, one of the major obstacles of the artificial upwelling is the high energy consumption. This study focused on the development of energy management technology for air-lift artificial upwelling by optimizing air injection rate. The fundamental principle underlying this technology is that the mode and intensity of air injection are adjusted from the feedback of information on velocity variation in tidal currents, illumination, and temperature of the surface layer. A series of equations to control air injection was derived based on seaweed growth and solar power generation. Although this finding was originally developed for the air-lift artificial upwelling, it also can be used in other areas of engineering, such as water delivery, aeration, and oxygenation. The simulations show that using a variable air injection rate can lift more nitrogen nutrients of 28.2 mol than using a fixed air injection rate of 26.6 mol, mostly with the same energy cost. Using this control algorithm, the changed temperature and dissolved oxygen profiles prove the effective upwelling in the experiments and the average weights of kelp are 33.1 g in the experimental group and 10.1 g in the control group.

Furthermore to examine the effect of HSE-related variables and occupational accidents amongst eight different offshore work groups on different installations and within different companies on the Norwegian continental shelf (NCS). The study is based on a large cross-sectional survey. The survey was distributed to all employees travelling offshore between December 2005 and March 2006 (N = 9945). The resulting sample consisted of employees employed within different companies on different installations, and working within different offshore work groups. The results showed that the correlations between health, safety and work environment were significant. Differences between the work groups were identified with regard to HSE-related variables, such as perceived work safety climate and perception of the psychosocial work environment. Perceived work safety climate along with perception of the physical and psychosocial work environment accounted for differing degrees of the explained variance in subjective health status and reported occupational accidents in the different offshore work groups. The study concludes that work group has to be taken into account when studying the effects of work safety climate and perception of the work environment on subjective health status as well as accident frequency.

Applying the joint exploration of P-wave and S-wave, the complex subsurface crustal structure can be obtained, which is helpful for oil and gas exploration. Based on the P-wave velocity structure of the Mesozoic sediments in the Chaoshan Depression of the profile OBS2006-3, we carried ray tracing and travel-time simulation of converted S-wave. The results reveal that the Mesozoic sediment in the Chaoshan Depression is remarkably thick with the maximum of 8 km, and the P-wave velocity increases downward from 4.4 km.s(-1) at the top to 5.3 km.s(-1) at the bottom. Accordingly, the S-wave velocity and Poisson's ratio are 2.6-3.0km.s(-1) and 0.24-0.26, respectively, which may imply the composition of Mesozoic strata are sandstone, mudstone and volcanic rocks.

The apron comprises variously angular, rounded, fractured, cracked, polished, and ventifacted dasts of bedrock (local and exotic), beachrock, and bioherm fragments (coral and worm reef). Terrestrial and anthropogenic clasts (from archeological sites, deflated dunes, flotsam, and shipwrecks) are also present. The unit forms as a lag deposit on top of a gently sloping (ca. 0.008), planar sandy deflation surface and is typically only one clast thick. It is up to 100 m wide and extends for tens of kilometers along the coast. It is replaced landward by a steep (ca. 0.1) deflated soil surface armored with a layer of iron concretions.Backbeach deflation aprons are compound deposits that result from marine storm, eolian, and human activity since the mid-Holocene. The depositional model proposed involves periodic storm deposition of coarse dasts (of beachrock, bedrock, and biogenic origin) and flotsam (shipwreck and other floating debris) on the backbeach or dunes. Some clasts are deposited directly into interdune depressions and enter the deflation plain immediately. Others are deposited initially on dune surfaces. Dune migration results in winnowing of the storm-deposited coarse clasts (together with rhizoliths and any other coarse material in the dune) until they come to rest on the deflation surface. The lag deposit is subsequently buried and uncovered multiple times by dune migration, during which time it is exposed to polishing and subaerial weathering. Consequently, the lag comprises a variety of materials that reflect both storm and eolian processes. The dasts exhibit variable degrees of rounding, polishing, and ventification according to how long they have been in the deposit.Backbeach deflation aprons are characteristic of sandy beaches along approximately 475 km (> 10% of the total length) of the South African east coast. They develop in association with large-scale transverse dunefields on the backbeach, which in turn depend on reversing shore-parallel winds and high sediment abundance. The variable degree of polishing and weathering, planar surface, low elevation, and back-beach location along extensive shoreline distances distinguish backbeach deflation aprons from tsunami or marine storm deposits.",,,,,,,,,9,3,0,0,3,0,14,,,1527-1404,,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Ulster, Sch Environm Sci, Coleraine BT52 1SA, Londonderry, North IrelandUniv KwaZulu Natal, Sch Agr Earth & Environm Sci, Kwa Zulu, South Africa",,,,2013-05-01,WOS:000321809800002,,

This study aims to identify environmental factors associated with the species presence, and map the probability of presence of the species across the western English Channel and southern Celtic Sea, and estimate the number of individuals in this area. Location: The western English Channel and southern Celtic Sea Methods: This study analyses strip transect data collected from vessel-based surveys in the western English Channel and southern Celtic Sea during the shearwaters post-breeding period between 2013 and 2017. Using environmental data collected directly and from remote sensors both Generalized Additive Models (GAMs) and the Random Forest (RF) machine learning model were used to determine shearwater presence at different locations. Results: Both models indicated that oceanographic features were better predictors of shearwater presence than fish abundance. Seafloor aspect, sea surface temperature, depth, salinity, and maximum current speed were the most important predictors. Based on the timing of the surveys (mainly in October) it is probable that most of the sighted shearwaters were immatures. Main conclusions: Areas with consistently high probabilities of shearwater presence were identified at the Celtic Sea front. Our estimates suggest that the study area in southwest Britain supports between 2% and 23% of the global population of Balearic shearwaters. This study provides the most complete understanding of Balearic shearwater distribution in UK waters available to date, information that will help inform any future UK conservation actions concerning this endangered species. Data maximum_current_speed_Feb5_2020.rds is an ASCII of simulated maximum depth-averaged horizontal tidal currents (m s-1) during April 2016. Because of the persistence and predictability of tidal currents, these values are representative of those encountered in the study area during the surveys. Values were sourced from an existing Finite Volume Community Ocean Model (FVCOM) for western UK (Cazenave, Torres et al. 2016) and resampled at ~1km resolution using bilinear interpolation. Coordinates are decimal degrees (WGS84). Values were constrained to <=3m/s to prevent unrealistic predictions from GAMS/Random Forest models, although very few locations have values > 3 m/s in the study area. stratification_index_Feb5_2020.rds is an ASCII of the Hunter-Simpson Stratification Index (Simpson and Hunter 1974) obtained using the equation log10 (h/u3), where h is the water depth (m) and u is the maximum depth-averaged current speed (m/s). Values of the former are provided from existing FVCOM for western UK (see above) whereas seabed depth was sourced from EMODNet. To provide values at 1km resolution, current speed was resampled at ~ 1km resolution using bilinear interpolation, whereas depth was already provided at ~ 1km resolution. Coordinates are decimal degrees (WGS84). Values < 1.9 and > 1.9 indicate water columns likely to remain mixed and become stratified in summer months, respectively. Values of ~ 1.9 indicate probable locations of tidal fronts between these water masses.

This critical function and valuable ecosystem service performed by soil microbes in coastal wetlands improves water quality and benefits the surrounding ecosystem. Five years after the Deepwater Horizon (DWH) oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico, a layer of crude oil was found similar to 5 cm beneath the wetland soil surface in Bay Jimmy, LA. While previous research found potential denitrification in coastal wetland soils was significantly reduced immediately following oil exposure, this study sought to investigate the effects of the long-term presence of spilled crude oil on nitrate removal. Intact soil cores were collected from a salt marsh heavily oiled by the DWH spill, and a nearby, non-oiled site in Barataria Bay, LA. The presence of a layer of buried oil increased nitrate removal from the overlying water column, a proxy measure of denitrification, by 31.8% in intact cores compared to non-oiled cores. However, when the oil was thoroughly mixed through the surface soil intervals, there was an 1853% decrease in the rate of denitrification. This seemingly contradictory result demonstrates that oil buried 5 cm below the surface, and not in contact with the newly accreted soil, did not negatively affect areal denitrification rates. However, when oil was in direct contact and well mixed in the soil, denitrifiers in that part of the soil profile are still negatively affected. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

The active Tertiary hydrocarbon system is a product of unique paleogeographic and tectonic events that led to Paleogene deposition of organic-rich source rocks, rapid Pliocene subsidence concurrent with voluminous supply of elastic sediments, and development of anticlinal traps with abundant share diapirs.Molecular characterization of selected oil samples indicates most of the oils are sourced from similar organic facies. The molecular characteristics are consistent with oils sourced from a Tertiary, slightly calcareous, marine elastic facies. Examination of oil molecular characteristics, oil-oil correlations, molecular characteristics of selected source rock samples, maturation models, and potential migration pathways suggests the oil is not syngenetic, but most likely sourced from deeper Miocene and older marine shales. Most of the oils have low to moderate organic maturities (VRE 0.75-0.85) relative to conventional peak generation windows. Significant variations in oil gravity and whole oil gas chromatogram character suggest post-emplacement bacterial and fractionation alteration. Several oils display characteristics consistent with multiple phases of trap charging. The bulk of reservoired gases examined in this study have been sourced from mixed terrestrial-marine kerogen generated at organic maturities of VRE 0.80-1.00 with some biogenic-low maturity mixing. None of the gases examined were sourced from the thermal destruction of liquid hydrocarbons.We postulate multi-stage hydrocarbon emplacement into evolving structural traps. The first phase of emplacement occurred in the Middle Pliocene when tectonic movement and increased subsidence initiated early trap/reservoir formation, hydrocarbon generation, and migration. Late rapid subsidence from Quaternary tectonic activity produced additional hydrocarbons to replenish older, depleted traps and charge newly formed traps. This late tectonic activity also extensively redistributed hydrocarbon accumulations, degassed some that were breached by faults, and destroyed other oil pools. Thermal disequilibrium from the rapid subsidence delayed hydrocarbon generation and increased the minimum depth required for the onset of liquid hydrocarbon generation.

The first type includes cleanup and restoration costs. The second type labelled as indirect damages, stems from the adverse physical effects of the spill, which occurred in spite of cleanup efforts. Indirect damages include costs to tourism, aquaculture and fishing industries, as well as amenities and ecological losses. While some damages refer to goods and services that are traded in the market place, others belong to the non-market category. When no market price is available, several approaches, including travel cost and contingent valuation methods can then be applied.The Amoco Cadiz case, which offered a good example of a comprehensive economic damage assessment, demonstrated that non-market damages represented an important share of total damages. With respect to damages caused by the Erika wreck, recreational and amenity losses concerned a quite short period of time but a highly populated shoreline close to an urbanized area, those of Nantes. Residents were disturbed by the accident, through their leisure activities, mainly shellfish collecting, a very popular activity on this coastline. For the residents, this is a major component of the whole damage. The problems with valuing ecological losses arise from the extensive uncertainty about how ecosystems function internally and what they do in terms of life supports functions. By now the economic literature favours willingness-to-pay approaches based either on the cost of restoration programmes or stated preference methods.",,,,,International Seminar on Ecological Damage Caused by Oil SpillsInternational Seminar on Ecological Damage Caused by Oil Spills,"MAY 18-19, 2006MAY 18-19, 2006","Univ Bretagne Occidentale, Ctr Droit & dEcon MerUniv Bretagne Occidentale, Ctr Droit & dEcon Mer","Paris, FRANCEParis, FRANCE",1,1,0,0,0,0,2,,,0182-0745,,978-2-903581-50-3,,,,,,,,,"INRA, Unite Econ & Sociol Rurales, F-35011 Rennes, France",,,,2008-01-01,WOS:000264091900004,,

Predicting the long-term fate of this oil is hindered by a lack of data about the combined influences of pressure, temperature, and sediment composition on microbial hydrocarbon remineralization in deep-sea sediments. To investigate crude oil biodegradation by native GOM microbial communities, we incubated core-top sediments from 13 GOM sites at water depths from 60-1500 m with crude oil under simulated aerobic seafloor conditions. Biodegradation occurred in all samples and followed a predictable compound class sequence dictated by molecular weight and structure. 45 to similar to 100% of total nalkane and 3 to 60% of total polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) were depleted. In reactors incubated at 4 degrees C and at pressures of 6-15 MPa, the depletion in total n-alkane was inversely correlated to pressure (R-2 similar to 0.85), equivalent to a 4% decrease in total n-alkane depletion for every 1 MPa increase. Our results indicated a modest inhibitory effect of pressure on biodegradation over our experimental range. However, the expansion of oil exploration to deeper waters (e.g., 5000 m) opens the risk of spills at conditions at which pressure might have a more pronounced effect",,,,,,,,,21,0,0,0,14,0,24,,,1932-6203,,,,,,,,,,,"Penn State Univ, Dept Geosci, University Pk, PA 16802 USAHamburg Univ Technol, Inst Tech Biocatalysis, Hamburg, Germany",,,,2018-12-28,WOS:000437246700028,29969471,

Currently, the role of inland waters in the global carbon cycle is modified and complicated by the huge number of reservoirs that are associated with climatic alteration due to their carbon sequestration and greenhouse gas emission functions. Moreover, reservoirs are distinct from natural rivers and lakes in various ways, promoting the emission of greenhouse gases from their surfaces and carbon accumulation in sediment through high sedimentation rates and larger ratios of watershed areas to reservoir areas. Consequently, their contributions to the global carbon cycle will increase in the coming decade as a result of an increase in the number of reservoirs. This assessment (1) demonstrates that reservoirs play a significant role in carbon burial and greenhouse gas emissions, (2) defines factors that influence the carbon budget of reservoirs, and (3) explains how reservoirs affect global climatic change. According to previous findings, reservoirs could serve as carbon sinks or sources, depending on the age, location, and climate of the given reservoir. Further, the magnitude of carbon burial and greenhouse gas emissions in reservoirs depends on productivity, land use, geology, water body type, and watershed morphometry. So far, few studies have examined both carbon storage and greenhouse gas emissions in reservoirs, and many efforts to quantify burial and emissions have been compromised by limited data availability. In this review, we mainly focus on recent literature on carbon burial and greenhouse gas emissions in reservoirs and global estimates of terrestrial carbon input to inland waters.",,,,,,,,,14,2,0,0,4,0,17,,,1735-1472,1735-2630,,,,,,,,,,"Shanghai Univ, Sch Environm & Chem Engn, POB 144,99 Shangda Rd, Shanghai 200444, Peoples R China",,,,2019-05-08,WOS:000465479000029,,

As a sequel as well as the finish to this survey, the current paper makes a thorough search for potential sites for actual tidal power generation along the entire shorelines of NJ and partial coast of New York, with special attention to locations near transportation infrastructures, and it evaluates their power density, surface area, water depth, distance to environmentally sensitive zones, etc. A list of 32 top sites are identified along the coastlines, and, among them, 21 sites with total surface area of 13 km(2) are located in the nearshore regions of NJ, and many sites are found next to its bridges. Another 10 favorable sites are also picked up near ports, docks, and marinas in NJ. An estimate indicates that 3.95 x 10(5) kW of tidal power could be extracted from the 21 sites. Analysis shows that sea-level-rise could substantially change tidal energy at the identified sites, and it is a factor that has to be taken into account in site selection. On the basis of these results, the approaches for a high-resolution survey for MHK energy are summarized and their future development is discussed. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

However, the prevalence of overweight among offshore workers has not been examined in recent data, and no longitudinal studies of body mass index (BMI) in this occupational group have been reported.Aims The present study sought to examine BMI levels in a sample of UK offshore personnel, and to evaluate demographic factors, smoking and work-related physical activity as predictors of BMI, and 5 year change in BMI.Methods Survey data (including age, education, marital status, work-related physical activity and height/weight) were collected in 1995 from male workers on 17 North Sea installations (n = 1581, 83% response rate); follow-up data were obtained in 2000 (n = 354, 34.9% of the potential sample).Results Overall mean BMI was 25.6 (2.8) kg/m(2): rates of obesity (BMI > 30) and overweight (BMI = 25-30) were 7.5 and 47.3%, respectively. Mean age was 38.7 (8.9) years; linear and quadratic age terms predicted BMI. Age-adjusted BMI values were very similar to those reported from other offshore studies over the past 15 years. Age, marital status, education, smoking and physical activity significantly predicted baseline BMI, but only age (and some interactive effects) predicted 5 year BMI change.Conclusions The present age-adjusted BMI values were closely similar to those found offshore in the mid-1980s, but also to recent national data; thus, North Sea personnel do not appear to reflect current population trends towards increased BMI levels. This result accords with the emphasis now given to health promotion (particularly dietary change) on offshore installations; the present findings also highlight the need to focus these initiatives on workers with sedentary jobs and/or low education.",,,,,,,,,17,0,0,0,6,1,21,,,0962-7480,,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Oxford, Dept Expt Psychol, Oxford OX1 3UD, England",,,,2003-05-01,WOS:000182627400009,12724556,

In addition to the ecological effect of a hydrocarbon release into the sea, its environmental impact is assessed by considering the amount of pollutant discharged. Therefore, limiting the impact of a spill consists in lowering the volume of oil released and effective early detection is necessary for implementation of mitigating measures. Standards and guidelines have been established for developing effective sensor networks in the subsea templates for both monitoring purposes and data collection. Sensors provide various and heterogeneous amount of information about the subsea template they are monitoring. According to recent definitions of risk, the level of knowledge should be considered during the risk assessment and evaluation phases for better managing potential impacts. The information provided by sensor networks indeed may be used in this perspective. For example, sensor functionality may be included in dynamic fault tree analysis in updating the information about system deviations' frequency.The work in this paper is focused on risk management using information provided from subsea sensor networks. The study adopts a top-down approach inspired by systems engineering to analyse the communication patterns among the different stakeholders. A real reference case from the oil and gas industry located in an environmentally sensitive area on the Norwegian Continental Shelf is used for testing the suggested approach.

The advantages of this method are expressed by maximizing the power captured by all the turbines deployed in a tidal farm and by optimizing the array layout size with twelve different configurations. The energy yield of the proposed designs is evaluated based on flow data for the hydrodynamic model used, impacts of sea depth, device installation constraints, and wake effects between the turbines on the farm. The results show that staggered layouts achieve higher efficiency for energy extraction than centered arrangements in all cases. Moreover, an array configuration with 48 turbines is least efficient for tidal farming as it suffers the highest energy losses caused by the wake effects in comparison with other designs.

This project replaced project 2301 after 2006-2007 (ASAC_2301). Public This work addresses Australian Government marine mammal conservation, management and policy needs with an emphasis on priorities from the International Whaling Commission and the Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources. The science outcomes will directly address knowledge gaps in our understanding of population structure, abundance, trend and distribution of the great whales and other predators, their ecological linkages and the role these animals play in the Southern Ocean ecosystem. Such science forms a powerful unpinning of Australia's important and high profile policy and management objectives nationally and in international conventions. Project objectives: This project has been specifically designed to deliver science outcomes against the Australian Government's marine mammal conservation, management and policy needs. It forms a central component of the work to be conducted by the staff of the newly established Australian Centre for Applied Marine Mammal Science (ACAMMS) in the AAD's Science Branch. The ACAMMS has been established as a central marine mammal science hub to build on existing, but disparate research and provide an integrated, strategic, cross-jurisdictional research effort to redress key knowledge gaps and underpin and support Australia's marine mammal conservation, management and policy priorities. The staff at the AAD hub will continue a research focus around IWC and Southern Ocean priorities. The objectives of this project will build upon the work on trophic linkages of marine mammals and their prey conducted since 2002 (AAS 2301) and will be fully integrated with other marine mammal focused research projects (AAS 2683 and 2926 in particular). The research emphasis will primarily focus upon the relevant scientific priorities from the International Whaling Commission (IWC) and the Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR), but will also be responsive to needs identified in national recovery plans (for threatened species) and broader management and policy needs of the Department primarily of Environment and Heritage. The research in the Southern Ocean will focus on the great whales, but will necessarily include key elements of the remaining marine mammal fauna (e.g. fine to meso-scale trophic interactions of krill predators in the pack-ice) The major research objectives will be to: - further develop marine ecosystem modelling to investigate issues of: o spatial and dynamic aspects of top-down trophic linkages o spatially and temporally structured predator movement and foraging dynamics. This will assist in the determination of trophic niches and potential for ecological competition between krill predators. Further, it will establish linkages between predator dynamics at meso(regional) and large scales; - quantify the dynamics of marine mammal population structure, distribution, abundance and trend through methodological improvements and implementation of; o genetic techniques (AAS 2926) o passive acoustic techniques (AAS 2683) o line transect survey techniques o biologging (telemetry transmitters and data-loggers) - continued development and implementation of powerful, non-lethal research techniques to improve the understanding of marine mammals - develop and 'mine' the cetacean sightings and strandings databases that have been recently passed to the AAD Data Centre by the DEH in order to provide strategic and relevant outputs for marine mammal management and conservation needs (work to be done in conjunction with the AADC). Taken from the 2008-2009 Progress Report: Progress against objectives: Animal tracking work: This work specifically defines the predator movement data needed as inputs into ecosystem models (Objective 1), as well as defines whale movements relevant to Objective 2. These data form an important component under Objective 3 of data needed to define management and conservation needs. Genetics: This work determines sex and stock structure and is also relevant to all Objectives, and in most particularly to 2 and 3. Aerial Survey: This major work contributes to understanding whale distribution in sea-ice and is highly relevant to all objectives. Database work: a great deal of progress has been made in the development of the structure and functionality of the data base and data input procedures for cetacean sightings, particularly in relation to data collected by the oil and gas industry. This work is a major contribution to objective 4. Taken from the 2009-2010 Progress Report: Progress against objectives: The AMMC has made substantial progress against the objectives, having conducted a number of large-scale field campaigns in the last twelve months: The second whale aerial survey was conducted successfully. This major work contributes to understanding whale distribution in sea-ice and is highly relevant to objectives 1, 2 and 3 as above.The previous survey in the 2008/09 summer was considered a 'pilot' and focussed on the Vincennes Bay polynya in December 2008. Survey effort this year (the austral summer of 2009/10) started in December 2009 and largely repeated the survey design from the first year, but also targeted areas around the Shackleton Ice Shelf and the Davis Sea, and finished with more effort over the Vincennes Bay polynya in late January and early February 2010. The aim of the aerial survey was to collaborate with a concurrent IWC-SOWER voyage surveying north of the ice edge, and to collect environmental information to study the distribution of minke whales within pack-ice environments. In total, 4,923 nm of effort was achieved, covering around 55,559 nm2 of survey area. Across the entire survey period there were 24 on-effort sightings (34 individuals) of minke whales; 5 sightings (5 individuals) of 'like' minke whales; and 5 sightings (5 individuals) of minke whales observed off-effort. Other species sighted were killer whales, southern right whales, sperm whales, southern bottlenose whales and a number of sightings of unknown species. Two papers were presented to the International Whaling Commission Scientific Committee in 2010 (please see section 1.6). The AMMC has produced basic estimates of relative densities in order to begin exploring abundance and distribution of minke whales within pack-ice both between and within the 2008/09 and 2009/10 austral summers in east Antarctica. These are, however, preliminary results and we intend to undertake a full analysis in the coming year. The AMMC continued its work on biologging and genetic research, conducting two satellite tag deployments on whales in Australian waters, one in New Zealand waters and one in Antarctica in early 2010 (see below). The satellite telemetry work specifically defines the predator movement data needed as inputs into ecosystem models (Objective 1), as well as defines whale movements relevant to Objective 2. These data form an important component under Objective 3 of data needed to define management and conservation needs. The genetic work determines sex and stock structure and is also relevant to all Objectives, and in most particularly to 2 and 3. Please see attached table of usage for numbers of tags deployed and biopsies collected on each trip. These datasets will be used to define the spatial and temporal migratory behaviour of these whales in Australian waters and beyond. The AMMC has also continued to develop and refine the design of the satellite tags used, moving to a tag that now has two AA batteries, substantially increasing the potential tracking duration. The joint Australian-New Zealand Antarctic Whale Expedition (AWE) completed its six week, non-lethal whale research voyage to Antarctic waters onboard the New Zealand Research Vessel Tangaroa on March 15th 2010 in Wellington, New Zealand. The research voyage was the first major activity of the Australian-led International Whaling Commission initiative in support of the multi-national Southern Ocean Research Partnership (SORP). The voyage objectives were to contribute directly to the research projects that are currently being developed for SORP. Major accomplishments of the AWE research voyage include: - Completion of the first successful non-lethal whale research voyage which directly contributes towards the core research projects of the Southern Ocean Research Partnership. - Demonstration of a successful model of using small boats, working around a capable ship, for non-lethal whale research in high latitude high seas. - The collection of over 60 biopsy skin samples, and over 60 individually identifiable tail fluke photographs from humpback whales on their Southern Ocean feeding grounds. - The satellite tagging of 30 humpback whales on their Southern Ocean feeding grounds. - The demonstration of the use of passive acoustics to track and locate vocalising Antarctic blue whales beginning at a distance of over 100 nautical miles. - The recording of humpback whale 'songs' on the feeding grounds. Prior to this, such songs have only been shown to occur on lower latitude breeding grounds and nearby migratory routes. - The detection of sounds most likely associated with Antarctic minke whales; a species that has been historically difficult to define acoustically. - The collection of hydro-acoustics data of whale prey in regions of high and low whale densities which can be used to better define the correlations between krill and whales in the Southern Ocean. With regards the databases, a great deal of progress has been made in the development of the structure and functionality of the data base and data input procedures for cetacean sightings, particularly in relation to data collected by the oil and gas industry. This work is a major contribution to objective 4. Taken from the 2010-2011 Progress Report: Public summary of the season progress: Good progress has been made in this marine mammal conservation and management project. New and important information on whale migratory behaviour (humpback, southern right, and blue whales) has been acquired, along with improved understandings of the way populations of right whales and humpback whales are divided. We have also continued the development of new and powerful techniques in measuring whale abundance, distribution in ice, and their age. Progress has also been made on design and function of the cetacean sightings database which enables this valuable tool to more effectively collect data and make it available to managers for conservation decisions.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,,0,0,8,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2012-11-19,DRCI:DATA2012217002355566,,

Mangroves provide a number of ecosystem services that are particularly beneficial to low-income coastal communities. However, dependence on natural resources can lead to environmental degradation. Despite the importance of this interaction, there is a significant gap in understanding the relationship between mangrove ecosystem services and poverty traps, mechanisms that cause poverty to persist, in low income coastal communities. This interdisciplinary research is a first step toward advancing our understanding of ecosystem services through the lens of poverty traps. It empirically investigates important feedback loops, drivers and other mechanisms that link poverty traps and mangrove ecosystems at multiple spatial and temporal scales. This project will inform stakeholders involved in coastal resource management and poverty alleviation how changes in mangrove ecosystem services are associated with poverty and vice versa, and examine new approaches to break the vicious cycle of resource degradation and poverty. The findings can potentially be extended to efforts to sustain ecosystem services provided by other natural resources in developing economies. The research will be conducted in rural coastal Tanzania where degradation of mangrove resources and persistent poverty continue to be significant challenges. An interdisciplinary research team with expertise in economics, ecology, hydrology, climatology, and system modeling will undertake a two-year study to conceptualize and provide empirical evidence for the feedback loops, drivers, and thresholds existing within and across natural and human systems for multiple ecogeomorphological and poverty conditions. The researchers will collect and use a wide range of ecological and socioeconomic data by synchronizing the temporal and spatial scales at four sites. Four ecosystem services of mangrove forests that are likely interlinked with poverty will be examined: (a) goods extracted (fuel wood, building poles, and charcoal), (b) fish and shrimp habitats, (c) coastal protection, and (d) prospects for carbon storage (as a net carbon sink),which will be assessed as a potential source of revenue to break poverty-environment traps. The ecological processes of mangrove ecosystem functions and their services, as well as the decision rules related to natural resource use, management, and livelihood inferred from empirical evidence will then be used to build an agent-based model to scale up to a regional level. This approach will help identify system-wide effects under alternative scenarios and simulate directions in which the coupled systems can evolve to benefit both the environment and coastal communities.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,1518471,,,,,,,,University of Rhode Island,,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:13726718,,

In recent times, the remains of World War II (WWII) warships have increasingly vanished from the Pacific seafloor causing a serious dilemma in underwater heritage preservation and environmental protection. The illicit removal of the wrecks illustrates the jurisdictional difficulties maritime powers face in preventing unauthorised interference with their sunken military property. It is alleged that the remnants of American, Australian, British, Dutch and Japanese warships have largely been the victim of metal pirates'. This paper highlights the threat posed to sunken WWII ships from metal pirates, who, unlike traditional treasure hunters, have specifically targeted ships' fixtures and fittings, bronze propellers and metal hulls, and in some cases, even unexploded ordnance. Besides the impact on heritage conservation and integrity, the actions of metal pirates are posing a significant threat to the marine environment, particularly given that many WWII wrecks to this day still contain considerable quantities of oil, ammunition, and unexploded. The illicit salvaging of WWII wrecks has the potential to cause the release of oil and toxic chemicals into the surrounding marine water resulting in the contamination of fishing grounds, therefore threatening the wider environmental security of the Asia-Pacific region. Indeed, as the legacy of the Pacific conflict is represented by the number of warships that rest on the seafloor, there is the potential for serious environmental harm occurring unless states cooperate with one another to prevent piracy and related maritime crime. Many WWII wrecks are historically significant, such as the USS Indianapolis, sunk in 1945 after delivering components of the atomic bombs to Tinian; while others, such as Australia's HMAS Perth, serve as war graves to their crew. As such, this paper considers the challenges states face in protecting sunken battleships from criminal syndicates who prey on the remnants of war.",,,,,,,,,5,0,0,0,0,0,5,,,1557-2285,1557-2293,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2019-03-07,WOS:000459385400001,,

Climate change is likely to alter estuaries through sea-level rise and changing precipitation patterns, although the ecological responses are uncertain. We were interested in plant responses to physiological stress induced by elevated water salinity and flooding conditions, which may be more prevalent under climate change.. We used a greenhouse experiment and factorial flooding (1, 12, 24, and 48 % time) and salinity (0, 5, 15, 30 PSU) treatments to evaluate the productivity responses of three emergent herbaceous species (Carex lyngbyei, Triglochin maritima, and Argentina pacifica) common to tidal marshes of the Pacific Northwest, USA. We measured weekly changes in plant height and final above and belowground biomass for all species after 10 weeks. Increased salinity reduced final above and belowground biomass significantly in all three species, with A. pacifica responding the most, followed by C. lyngbyei and T. maritima. Increased flooding also reduced total biomass in A. pacifica and T. maritima. There was a significant response in C. lyngbyei aboveground biomass and A. pacifica height to the flooding-salinity interaction. These results indicate emergent plant community composition may change in response to novel climate conditions in estuaries, driven by distinct physiological tolerances to salinity and flooding, and highlight the importance of considering multiple climate drivers when projecting ecosystem change. This may be especially true for estuaries that currently have prolonged freshwater phases like those in the Pacific Northwest.",,,,,,,,,10,1,0,0,7,0,11,,,0304-3770,1879-1522,,,,,,,,,,"US Geol Survey, Western Ecol Res Ctr, One Shields Dr, Davis, CA 95616 USAOregon State Univ, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA",,,,2020-06-09,WOS:000535951000006,,

There was a highly significant correlation between concentrations of methylmercury (MeHg+) and inorganic mercury (Hg2+) in individual fish, and the mean ratio of MeHg+ compared to Sigma Hg (MeHg+ He+) was 94.0%. The results revealed statistically significant differences in concentrations of MeHg+ and Hg2+, respectively, between sampling areas. Mean concentrations in the German Bight (North Sea), in Icelandic waters and in Mecklenburg Bight (Baltic Sea) were low (MeHg+: 0.023-0.036; Hg2+: 0.001-0.002 mg/kg wet weight), while concentrations in dab from the Dogger Bank, Firth of Forth and the vicinity of the Ekofisk oil field (all North Sea) were significantly higher (MeHg+: 0.059-0.101; Hg2+; 0.003-0.004 mg/kg wet weight). Statistical correlation analysis on effects of host-specific factors revealed that neither length, weight, age, sex nor condition factor showed a significant relationship with Hg concentrations. However, Hg concentrations were significantly correlated with the Fish Disease Index (FDI), indicating a relationship between Hg concentrations and the health status of dab. Multiple linear regression analysis aiming to find factors affecting Hg concentrations revealed that only the sampling area had a highly significant main effect on Hg concentrations, and in some cases, additionally the condition factor contributed significantly to the final model. From the results, it cannot be excluded that elevated Hg concentration recorded in dab were linked to discharges from offshore oil and gas installations and that Hg affected the health status of dab.

Some of these devices are fixed to the seabed and it is, therefore, necessary to have special high performance ships to transport them from the base port to the tidal farm and to subsequently recover the main units of these devices. These ships are very costly, thus making the installation costs very high and, in some cases, probably unfeasible. According to what has occurred to date, the costs of the installation and maintenance procedures depend, to a great extent, on the reliability and accessibility of the devices. One of the possible solutions as regards increasing system performance and decreasing the costs of the installation and maintenance procedures is the definition of automated maneuvers, which will consequently influence: (i) an increase in the competitiveness of these technologies; (ii) a reduction in the number and duration of installation and maintenance operations; (iii) less human intervention, or (iv) the possibility of using cheaper general purpose ships rather than high cost special vessels for maintenance purposes, among others. In this research, we propose a definition of the procedures required for the manual and automated installation and maintenance maneuvers of gravity-based first generation TECs. This definition will allow us to quantify the costs of both the manual and automated operations in a more accurate manner and enable us to determine the reduction in the cost of the automated installation and maintenance procedures. It will also enable us to demonstrate that the automation of these maneuvers may be an interesting solution by which to improve the competitiveness of tidal systems in the near future.",,,,,,,,,12,0,0,0,0,0,12,,,,1996-1073,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Castilla La Mancha, Escuela Tecn Super Ingn Ind Albacete, Albacete 02071, SpainUniv Politecn Madrid, Escuela Tecn Super Ingn Navales, E-28040 Madrid, Spain",,,,2019-08-19,WOS:000477034700010,,
J,,,,,,,,,Elizabeth Kirk,,Science Based Regulation of Arctic Energy Installations (SciBAr Installations),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Awarded Grant,Dec 01 2017,2017,"This grant will facilitate development of a transdiciplinary network of academics and stakeholders designed to provide a 360 degree review of the governance and regulation of threats and impacts to the environment, industry, local communities and other stakeholders associated with offshore energy installations in the Arctic. The network will examine the degree to which the physical sciences, technology and engineering must and can influence regulation and governance to ensure sustainability of Arctic activities. As Arctic sea ice melts opportunities open up to use offshore installations in the extraction of oil and gas or to generate renewable energy through wind or wave power, or ocean thermal energy conversion. Given the relatively low level of activity in the Arctic and given that some similar issues arise with all types of installation, the network will focus equally on all types of installation regardless of purpose. High profile accidents elsewhere in the world, such as the Deepwater Horizon blow-out in 2010, highlight the risks of harm that these activities bring with them. These include, risks to the environment through pollution or habitat changes and to local communities of interference with the ways in which they secure their livelihoods e.g. through fishing or tourism. In the Arctic the risks are particularly pronounced because the species found there are highly cold adapted and specialized species, the ecosystems unique and our understanding of these species and ecosystems even more limited than it is in relation to the oceans more generally. In addition extreme health and safety risks for workers arise due to the remoteness and inaccessibility of the ice-laden environment in which installations will be placed. The energy industry also faces risks, such as, of operating in a rapidly changing regulatory context as seen in the USA where Presidential orders have changed the regulatory context rapidly since 2015 and continuing today.Greater certainty in regulation and governance at the international and national levels would benefit all stakeholders as would more detailed regulations based upon sound science designed with the Arctic context in mind. We do not, however, have this, instead we have, global treaties such as the UN Convention of the Law of the Sea 1982 (UNCLOS), which are designed to be applicable in all areas of the oceans from the Caribbean to the Arctic and do not regulate in any detail the specific challenges found in the Arctic such as addressing an oil spill in an icebound area. We also have some Arctic specific treaties, but their focus is narrow, addressing, for example, fisheries rather than all Arctic activities. While the Arctic Council provides a forum for the development of non-binding policies and programmes of action designed for the Arctic, the measures it adopts are generally unenforceable. And while it has recently facilitated the development of 2 treaties, there is no guarantee of more binding laws to come, or indeed that they would address regulation of offshore energy installations.This network is being established to research and test the design of best regulation based on scientific evidence regarding the Arctic environment and to model best governance systems for the delivery of such regulation in the future. Its starting point is to map the current understanding of threats and impacts from and to offshore energy installations in the Arctic. The network will be developed through targeted invitations to specific academics, stakeholders, policy makers and regulators to participate in the network and in two workshops designed to develop that network. A web page will be established to facilitate ongoing communications between the network participants and distribution of findings of research more generally. The key impacts from future work of the network will be evidence-based regulation delivered through stronger governance systems.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,AH/R003203/1,,,,,,,,Nottingham Trent University,,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:15389456,,

Nonetheless, hydrocarbon agreements do have one important positive impact. They prevent resource-related militarized confrontations, thereby reducing the risk of territorial dispute escalation.

There is a limited amount of published research directly related to HMS and OPPs. This may be due to the relatively recent offshore expansion of the industry and of studies. Most studies have focused on structure-associated species such as rockfishes and snappers. Within the U.S. exclusive economic zone, the most probable areas of interaction between HMS and OPPs occur in the Gulf of Mexico. This report focuses primarily upon this region, while noting that HMS roam the majority of the world's oceans and may interact with petroleum infrastructure in many other locations.

During July and August 1999 two locations in the Clyde Sea were instrumented with moored RD Instruments Acoustic Doppler Current Profilers (ADCPs) and conductivity-temperature-pressure chains: Station C2, near the shallow entrance sill (55 m water depth), and station C1 in the deep basin (155 m water depth). A bottom pressure recorder was also deployed at station C3 by the seaward entrance to the Clyde Sea in the North Channel of the Irish Sea. A Free-falling Light Yo-yo shear microstructure profiler (FLY) was used to measure the dissipation rate of turbulent kinetic energy (TKE) throughout the water column over 25 h at both C1 and C2. These were interspersed with two-hourly conductivity-temperature-depth casts at both sites. The observations show agreement between the dissipation rate of TKE estimated by using a microstructure profiler and that estimated from the decay of the internal tide as measured by the two ADCPs. However, to account for all the implied mixing it is necessary to invoke an additional source of buoyancy flux, the most probable candidate mechanism is enhanced internal wave breaking near the sill and at the sloping boundaries of the deep basin. In addition, the vertical eddy diffusivity estimated from the micro-structure profiler (O(0.5 cm(2) s(-1)) indicates that internal tide induced mixing away from any boundaries contributed significantly to the overall level of mixing which is required to account for the observed evolution of the deep basin water properties.",,,,,,,,,22,0,0,0,3,0,22,,,1567-7419,1573-1510,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Highlands & Isl, Millennium Inst, Scottish Assoc Marine Sci, Dunstaffnage Marine Lab, Oban PA37 1QA, Argyll, ScotlandUniv Wales Bangor, Sch Ocean Sci, Menai Bridge LL59 5EY, Anglesey, Wales",,,,2002-09-01,WOS:000208549100003,,

While organic carbon storage on land appears to have been much less than present during the cold, dry glacial maximum, calcrete (soil carbonate) carbon storage would have been greater. Here we attempt a global estimation of this change; we use published figures for present soil carbonate by biome to estimate changing global soil carbonate storage, on the basis of reconstruction of vegetation areas for four timeslices since the Last Glacial Maximum. It appears that there would most likely have been around a 30-45% decrease in calcrete carbon on land accompanying the transition between glacial and interglacial conditions. This represents a change of about 500-400 GtC (outer error Limits are estimated at 750-200 GtC). In order to be weathered into dissolved bicarbonate, this would take up an additional 500-400 GtC (750-200 GtC) in CO2 from ocean/atmosphere sources. An equivalent amount to the carbonate leaving the caliche reservoir on land may have accumulated in coral reefs and other calcareous marine sediments during the Holocene, liberating an equimolar quantity of CO2 back into the ocean-atmosphere system as the bicarbonate ion breaks up.

The aim of this study was to establish whether estrogens and their mimics are present in marine waters at concentrations that can produce biological responses in fish and, if so, to discover whether the effects are likely to be harmful to populations and communities through changes in reproductive and other physiological processes. Laboratory studies and extensive field surveys were carried out with the euryhaline flounder (Plalichthys flesus), using the amount of yolk protein vitellogenin in the blood of free-living male fish as an indicator of exposure to estrogens. Exposure to the synthetic estrogen ethynylestradiol for 3 weeks confirmed that the vitellogenin response was made and showed that this species is about one order of magnitude less sensitive than the freshwater species rainbow trout. The fish did not respond to the estrogen mimic nonylphenol at concentrations of 30 mu g/L. Wild male flounder were sampled from four contaminated United Kingdom estuaries: the Tyne, Crouch, Thames, and Mersey. Fish from one or more sites in each estuary had significantly elevated concentrations of vitellogenin in their blood when compared to concentrations in fish from the clean control estuary (Alde River). Vitellogenin concentrations in the Tyne and Mersey fish were four and six orders of magnitude greater, respectively, than control concentrations. Elevated vitellogenin concentrations were also seen in some male flounder caught in coastal areas. Approximately 20% of male fish from the Mersey estuary contained oocytes in their testes, but this intersex condition was not seen elsewhere.

It is critical now more than ever given the increased ecosystem pressures on these critical coastal habitats. A budget of PAHs and cycling has been created for Galveston Bay (Texas) in the northwestern Gulf of Mexico, an estuary surrounded by 30-50% of the US capacity of oil refineries and chemical industry. We estimate that approximately 3 to 4 mt per year of pyrogenic PAHs are introduced to Galveston Bay via gaseous exchange from the atmosphere (ca. 2 mt/year) in addition to numerous spills of petrogenic PAHs from oil and gas operations (ca. 1.0 to 1.9 mt/year). PAHs are cycled through and stored in the biota, and ca. 20 to 30% of the total (0.8 to 1.5 mt per year) are estimated to be buried in the sediments. Oysters concentrate PAHs to levels above their surroundings (water and sediments) and contain substantially greater concentrations than other fish catch (shrimp, blue crabs and fin fish). Smaller organisms (infaunal invertebrates, phytoplankton and zooplankton) might also retain a significant fraction of the total, but direct evidence for this is lacking. The amount of PAHs delivered to humans in seafood, based on reported landings, is trivially small compared to the total inputs, sediment accumulation and other possible fates (metabolic remineralization, export in tides, etc.), which remain poorly known. The generally higher concentrations in biota from Galveston Bay compared to other coastal habitats can be attributed to both intermittent spills of gas and oil and the bay's close proximity to high production of pyrogenic PAHs within the urban industrial complex of the city of Houston as well as periodic flood events that transport PAHs from land surfaces to the Bay.",,,,,,,,,8,0,0,0,5,0,9,,,1932-6203,,,,,,,,,,,"Texas A&M Univ, Dept Marine Biol, Galveston, TX 77553 USAPrairie View A&M Univ, Dept Chem, Prairie View, TX USAUniv Texas Med Branch, Dept Pathol, Galveston, TX 77555 USATexas A&M Univ, Dept Oceanog, College Stn, TX 77843 USATexas A&M Univ, Dept Marine & Coastal Environm Sci, Galveston, TX 77554 USA",,,,2020-12-28,WOS:000603611900118,33370322,

These pipelines are frequently subjected to high thermal and pressure loadings that induce pipeline upheaval buckling (UHB). The uplift resistance provided by the cover soil increases with pipeline upward mobilization and reaches its peak at peak mobilization. This peak mobilization is fundamental for safe UHB designs. This paper highlights that the design guidelines underestimate the peak mobilization. The paper presents full-scale uplift results and finite-element parametric studies in which loose and dense cover soils of up to 3 m (soil cover height to diameter ratio up to 15) and pipeline diameters of 114 and 200 mm were investigated. Results from full-scale and finite-element modeling show that the peak pipe mobilization can be much greater than that suggested by current guidelines, and it is a function of the soil cover height to diameter ratio and soil relative density. A new relationship is proposed to predict peak mobilization from the soil cover height to diameter ratio for a given soil state.

We present a 28,000-year high-resolution record of carbonate ion concentration, a key parameter of the global carbon cycle, at 5-km water depth in the South Atlantic. We observe similar carbonate ion concentrations between the Last Glacial Maximum and the late Holocene, despite elevated concentrations in the glacial surface ocean. This strongly supports the importance of respiratory carbon accumulation in a stratified deep ocean for atmospheric CO2 reduction during the last ice age. After similar to 9 mu mol/kg decline during Heinrich Stadial 1, deep South Atlantic carbonate ion concentration rose by similar to 24 mu mol/kg from the onset of Bolling to Preboreal, likely caused by strengthening North Atlantic Deep Water formation (Bolling) or increased ventilation in the Southern Ocean (Younger Drays) or both (Pre-boreal). The similar to 15 mu mol/kg decline in deep water carbonate ion since similar to 10 ka is consistent with extraction of alkalinity from seawater by deepsea CaCO3 compensation and coral reef growth on continental shelves during the Holocene.Between 16,600 and 15,000 years ago, deep South Atlantic carbonate ion values converged with those at 3.4-km water depth in the western equatorial Pacific, as did carbon isotope and radiocarbon values. These observations suggest a period of enhanced lateral exchange of carbon between the deep South Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, probably due to an increased transfer of momentum from southern westerlies to the Southern Ocean. By spreading carbon-rich deep Pacific waters around Antarctica for up-welling, invigorated interocean deep water exchange would lead to more efficient CO2 degassing from the Southern Ocean, and thus to an atmospheric CO2 rise, during the early deglaciation.

We propose the use of laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS) analytical technique to detect carbon dioxide leaks to aid in the successful application of CCS. LIBS has a real-time monitoring capability and can be reliably used for the elemental and isotopic analysis of solid, liquid, and gas samples. The flexibility of probe design and use of fibre optics make it a suitable technique for real time measurements in harsh conditions and at hard-to-reach places. Proposed monitoring with LIBS includes terrestrial soil samples, water samples from monitoring wells or from different formations, air samples from monitoring wells or suspected leakage areas.

Successful offshore wind energy development relies to some extent on accurate prediction of wind resources, but since installing and operating a meteorological mast in situ is expensive, prospective sites must be carefully evaluated. Accordingly, one can conceptualize the wind resource assessment process as a two-phase activity: (i) an evaluation of wind resources at the regional scale to locate promising wind farm sites and (ii) a site specific evaluation of wind climatology and vertical profiles of wind and atmospheric turbulence, in addition to an assessment of historical and possibly future changes due to climate non-stationarity. Phase (i) of the process can involve use of in situ observations of opportunity derived from ships, lighthouses and buoys in conjunction with model tools and remote sensing products. The reliability of such data sources has been extensively investigated in different national and European projects especially in Northern Europe, and the results are summarized herein. Phase (ii) of the project often still requires in situ observations (which may or may not be supplemented with ground-based remote sensing technologies) and application of tools to provide a climatological context for the resulting measurements.

While the higher penetration of renewable energy is currently the backbone of Green Econotny efforts, an emerging body of literature demonstrates that the renewable energy sector can affect ecosysteins and biodiversity. The current review synthesizes the existing knowledge at the interface of renewable energy and biodiversity accross the five drivers of ecosystem change and biodiversity loss of the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment (MA) framework (i.e. habitat loss/change, pollution, overexploitation, climate change and introduction of invasive species). It identifies the main impact mechanisms for different renewable energy pathways, including solar, wind, hydro, ocean, geothermal and bioenergy. Our review demonstrates that while all reviewed renewable energy pathways are associated (directly or indirectly) with each of the five MA drivers of ecosystem change and biodiversity loss, the actual impact mechanisms depend significantly between the different pathways, specific technologies and the environmental contexts within which they operate. With this review we do not question the fundamental logic of renewable energy expansion as it has been shown to have high environmental and socio-economic benefits. However, we want to make the point that some negative impacts on biodiversity do exist, and need to be considered when developing renewable energy policies. We put these findings into perspective by illustrating the major knowledge/practices gaps and policy implications at the interface of renewable energy, biodiversity conservation and the Green Economy.",,,,,,,,,221,3,1,2,70,0,238,,,1364-0321,1879-0690,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Tokyo, Integrated Res Syst Sustainabil Sci IR3S, Tokyo, JapanUnited Nations Univ, Inst Adv Study Sustainabil IAS, Tokyo, JapanUniv Tokyo, GPSS GLI, Kashiwa, Chiba, Japan",,,,2017-04-01,WOS:000396184900016,,

Compiled from data from several sources including nautical maps, geodatabases, ground truth and remote sensing data, GIS allows the retrieval of key information, such as predicting oil spill locations, revealing offshore/onshore sources, and estimating the intensity of oil pollution. SAR and GIS technologies can improve the identification and classification of oil spills, leading to construction of the final product, an oil spill distribution map.

This pipe shows nonlinear behavior due to large deflection under hydrodynamic forces due to waves, current, ship velocity, and ship-induced vibration. A finite element formulation has been developed for the two dimensional nonlinear coupled response of the pipe system categorized as system -I and system -II. Pipe top is pinned to the ship and the bottom end is connected to the nodule collector/equipment in system-I. In system -II bottom end is kept free of the self-propelled seafloor nodule miner and top end is connected to the ship. The mineral ore is transported from the sea bed to the mining ship in the form of slurry. Primarily the study aims at the determination of dynamic characteristics of the mining pipe considering different boundary conditions. Instantaneous geometric nonlinearity has been taken into consideration through inclusion of geometric stiffness matrix. The added mass effect has also been taken into account together with the self weight of the pipe. Ship induced motions influence the response significantly. Furthermore, the influence of two phase slurry flow on the dynamic behavior of the mining pipe has been studied. A direct step by step integration in the time domain has been adopted to solve the equation of motion. An iterative scheme utilizing the normal mode theory has been employed to decouple and solve the equation of motion.

We examine differences between onshore and offshore CO2-EOR, emerging technologies that could enable projects, as well as approaches and regulatory requirements that may help overcome barriers. Our review shows that there are few, if any, technical barriers to offshore CO2-EOR. However, there are many other barriers to the implementation of offshore CO2-EOR, including: High investment and operation costs, uncertainties about reservoir performance, limited access of CO2 supply, lack of business models, and uncertainties about regulations.

We present an analytical framework to aid in reducing such conflicts by allocating control effort to both minimise negative impacts and to maximise positive impacts on multiple ES. We used spatial models to map the negative impacts of invasive conifers on biodiversity, perceived landscape quality, and water yield and their positive impacts on erosion protection and carbon storage across a major catchment in the South Island of New Zealand. We tested the effect of distribution type (i.e. hotspot vs Gaussian) on trade-offs among these ES. We also tested whether using a non-linear function optimisation algorithm to fit variable weights to individual ES significantly reduced trade-offs. We show that an optimised multiple-ES approach could considerably reduce conflicts around invasive tree management arising from their contrasting impacts on different ecosystem services (i.e. by reducing trade-offs between ES), but cannot remove such conflict altogether. Our results are consistent with studies showing that ES with a hot-spot type distribution are the most vulnerable to trade-offs in multi-ES prioritisation, and hence will be the most likely to cause conflict in invasive tree control decisions. Our approach also shows that giving higher priority to ES with hot-spot distributions could reduce conflicts (by reducing tradeoffs).

Normalised Cross-Correlation Function analysis allowed us to correlate these observations. A marked inter-seasonal variability was found in both current and local wind velocity observations but a significant level of correlation between the data was only found during strong wind events. Current and wind directions appeared to be uncorrelated and current measurements showed a predominant NW SE direction, presumably linked to the shape and orientation of Giglio Island itself. During strong winds from the SSE, current flow was towards the NNW but it suddenly switched from the NNW to the SE at the end of wind events. The results show that, at Giglio Island, currents are principally dominated by the general cyclonic Tyrrhenian circulation, and, secondly, by strong wind events.

The short lifespan and dynamic nature of well drilling operations makes this a challenge. Experiences from several industry accidents the last decade reveal that two well barriers were not properly maintained by the drilling personnel during the operation and thus that safety was compromised. Probabilistic risk assessments are considered key for risk management of low probability and high consequence activities such as offshore oil and gas well drilling. The objective of this article is to present a method that can be used to address human factors modelling as an integral part of a well drilling operation risk assessment. The method represents an adoption and extension made to the human reliability analysis part of an existing method denoted 'Risk OMT'. Risk OMT is a risk influence modelling method with a modelling principle that includes human factors assessment. Risk OMT has been demonstrated for purpose of analysis of leak scenarios related to planning or execution and control of offshore process maintenance activities. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

PAHs, heavy hydrocarbons and metals were analyzed according to standard methods, in order to satisfy quality assurance and quality check constraints. Total PAHs concentration (Sigma(16) compounds) were in the range of 25-4000 ng/g, and 30-800 ng/g for marine sediments and soil samples, respectively. Even some samples from the Cies Islands, show a contamination with values achieving > 200 ng/g of PAHs. Although contamination levels have been shown to be strong at several locations in the study area, their ranges are those typical of other estuarine sites, with PAHs and hydrocarbons primarily of pyrolytic origin.

Offshore windfarms require construction procedures that minimise impacts on protected marine mammals. Uncertainty over the efficacy of existing guidelines for mitigating near-field injury when pile-driving recently resulted in the development of alternative measures, which integrated the routine deployment of acoustic deterrent devices (ADD) into engineering installation procedures without prior monitoring by Marine Mammal Observers. 2. We conducted research around the installation of jacket foundations at the UKs first deep-water offshore windfarm to address data gaps identified by regulators when consenting this new approach. Specifically, we aimed to a) measure the relationship between noise levels and hammer energy to inform assessments of near-field injury zones, b) assess the efficacy of ADDs to disperse harbour porpoises from these zones. 3. Distance from source had the biggest influence on received noise levels but, unexpectedly, received levels at any given distance were highest at low hammer energies. Modelling highlighted that this was because noise from pin pile installations was dominated by the strong negative relationship with pile penetration depth with only a weak positive relationship with hammer energy. 4. Acoustic detections of porpoises along a gradient of ADD exposure decreased in the 3-hours following a 15-minute ADD playback, with a 50% probability of response within 21.7 km. The minimum time to the first porpoise detection after playbacks was > 2 hours for sites within 1 km of the playback. 5. Our data suggest that the current regulatory focus on maximum hammer energies needs review, and future assessments of noise exposure should also consider foundation type. Despite higher piling noise levels than predicted, responses to ADD playback suggest mitigation was sufficiently conservative. Conversely, strong responses of porpoises to ADDs resulted in far-field disturbance beyond that required to mitigate injury. We recommend that risks to marine mammals can be further minimised by: 1) optimising ADD source signals and/or deployment schedules to minimise broad-scale disturbance; 2) minimising initial hammer energies when received noise levels were highest; 3) extending the initial phase of soft start with minimum hammer energies and low blow rates.Minhyuk Seo Piling noise andAcoustic Deterrent device signals weremeasured using calibrated broadband noise recorders (Soundtrap ST300HF,Ocean Instruments) moored2 mabove the seabed. An array of moored echolocation detectors (V.0 and V.1 CPODs (www.chelonia.co.uk)) was used to assess variation in harbour porpoise detections in relation to experimental ADD exposure.

Due to the world's large stock of low-cost fossil fuels, there is strong motivation to explore the opportunities for capturing the CO2 that is produced in the combustion of fossil fuels and keeping it out of the atmosphere. Three distinct sets of technologies are needed to allow for climate neutral use of fossil fuels: (1) capture of CO2 at concentrated sources like electric power plants, future hydrogen production plants and steel and cement plants; (2) capture of CO2 from the air; and (3) the safe and permanent storage of CO2 away from the atmosphere. A strong regime of carbon accounting is also necessary to gain the public's trust in the safety and permanence of CO2 storage. This paper begins with an extensive overview of carbon capture and storage technologies, and then presents a vision for the potential implementation of carbon capture and storage, drawing upon new ideas such as air capture technology, leakage insurance, and monitoring using a radioactive isotope such as C-14.

If successfully developed and deployed, they could allow the continued use of fossil fuels whilst achieving large reductions in emissions. Although under active development, there are significant uncertainties about the technical, economic and financial viability of CCS. This project will conduct an independent, inter-disciplinary assessment of CCS viability from now to 2030, by a three-institution partnership from the Universities of Sussex, Edinburgh and Imperial College in close co-operation with research user organisations. Results will contribute to academic understanding, public policy making and business analysis of CCS. The project team includes expertise in CCS engineering and storage; in the analysis of low carbon innovation; and in energy economics and policy. The project has three main objectives: - To help policy makers to understand the conditions for successful commercialisation of CCS technologies with respect to a range of criteria - and to inform policy decisions on whether to make these technologies mandatory for fossil fuel power plants and other large sources of fossil fuel emissions - To develop a new approach to the assessment of emerging low carbon technologies by studying past innovations with similar characteristics to CCS, and the way in which they were developed and deployed. - To contribute to the UK Energy Research Centre's research programme by providing a source of independent expertise in CCS technologies, by improving understanding of their potential role in low carbon energy systems, and by developing tools to assess technologies with multiple uncertainties To meet these objectives, the research project includes three main research activities and a programme of engagement and dissemination. The research activities are: 1. The identification of key dimensions of uncertainty for CCS.

During installation and operation, these structures are subjected to repetitive motions which can cause the surrounding seabed soil to be remolded and soften. This disturbance leads to significant changes in the operative shear strength, which must be assessed in design. This paper presents an analytical framework that aims to quantify the degradation in undrained shear strength as a result of gross disturbance-in this case through repeated vertical movement of a cylindrical object embedded in undrained soil. The parameters of the framework were calibrated using data obtained in a geotechnical centrifuge test. In this test a T-bar penetrometer, which is a cylindrical tool used to characterize the strength of soft soil, was cycled vertically in soil with strength characteristics typical of a deep water seabed. Using simple assumptions regarding the spatial distribution of damage resulting from movement of the cylinder, and by linking this damage to the changing undrained shear strength via a simple degradation model, the framework is shown to simulate well the behavior observed in a cyclic T-bar test. This framework can potentially be extended to the similar near-surface behavior associated with seabed pipelines and risers.",,,,,,,,,28,0,0,0,1,0,28,,,1532-3641,1943-5622,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Western Australia, Ctr Offshore Fdn Syst, Perth, WA 6009, Australia",,,,2010-06-01,WOS:000208971200003,,

The construction of large scale Mississippi River sediment diversions is currently being planned in an effort to help combat coastal wetlands losses at a rate of >50 km(-2) y(-1). The Wax Lake Delta (WLD) is currently being used as a model for evaluating potential land gain from large scale diversions of Mississippi River water and sediment. In this study, we determine the impact of the WLD diversion on plant production at newly formed islands within the delta and adjacent, mainland freshwater marshes. Plant aboveground productivity, sediment nutrient status and short term accretion were measured at three locations on a transect at each of three fresh water marsh sites along Hog Bayou and at six newly formed emerging island sites in the delta. Spring flooding has resulted in a greater increase in plant production and consequently, greater carbon sequestration potential in adjacent mainland marshes compared to the newly formed island sites, which contain less total carbon (C), nitrogen (N), and phosphorus (P) in the sediment. While sediment diversions are predicted to create land, as seen in island formation in the WLD, the greatest benefit of river sediment diversions from a carbon credit perspective might be to the adjacent freshwater mainland marshes for several reasons. Both greater plant production and sediment C accumulation are two important factors for marsh stability, while perhaps even more critical, is the prevention of the loss of stored sediment C in the marsh profile. This stored C would be lost without the introduction of freshwater, nutrients and sediment through river sediment diversion efforts. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Above- and belowground biomass was measured after three and four years' growth. In both years, the all-species mix (ABC) had significant overyielding of roots, suggesting complementarity mediated by differences in rhizosphere use amongst species. In year four, there was higher belowground than aboveground biomass in all but one treatment. Belowground biomass was strongly influenced by the presence of the most vigorously growing species, A. marina.

In offshore drilling equipment, electric motors tend to replace traditionally used hydraulic motors, especially in rotational motion control applications. However, force densities available from linear hydraulic actuators are still typically higher than those of electric actuators. Therefore, usually the remaining source of hydraulic power is thereby the hydraulic cylinder. This paper presents a feasibility study on the implementation of an electromechanical cylinder drivetrain on an offshore vertical pipe handling machine. The scope of this paper is to investigate the feasibility of a commercial off-the-shelf drivetrain. With a focus on the motion performance, numerical modeling and simulation are used when sizing and selecting the components of the considered electromechanical cylinder drivetrain. The simulation results are analyzed and discussed together with a literature study regarding advantages and disadvantages of the proposed solution considering the design criteria of offshore drilling equipment. It is concluded that the selected drivetrain can only satisfy the static motion requirements since the required transmitted power is higher than the recommended permissible power of the transmission screw. Consequently, based on the recommendation of the manufacturer, avoidance of overheating cannot be guaranteed for the drivetrain combinations considered for the case study presented in this paper. Hence, to avoid overheating, the average speed of the motion cycle must be decreased. Alternatively, external cooling or temperature monitoring and control system that prevents overheating could be implemented.",,,,,,,,,14,0,0,0,0,0,14,,,0332-7353,1890-1328,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Agder, Dept Engn Sci, N-4898 Grimstad, NorwayAalborg Univ, Dept Energy Technol, DK-9220 Aalborg, Denmark",,,,2017-05-31,WOS:000401116300002,,

OSRA informs MSP on areas of high risk to oil spills allowing a redefinition of planning objectives and the relocation of activities to increase the ecosystem's overall utility and resilience. Concomitantly, MSP continuously generates a large amount of data that is vital to OSRA. The Environmental Sensitivity Index (ESI) mapping system emerges as an operational tool to implement the MSP-OSRA link. Given the high level of commonalities between ESI and MSP data (both in biophysical and human dimensions), ESI tools (both paper maps and dynamic GIS-based product) are easily developed to further inform MSP and oil spill risk management.

Risk maps were obtained by assigning threat to countries where they were reported, further refining geo-referencing by allocation to ocean basins and Longhurst biogeographical provinces and by intersection with mapped species distributions of AquaMaps using the core habitat (RES≥0.6, http://www.aquamaps.org/). Marine mammal species classification in AquaMaps follows the Taxonomy of Catalogue of Life (http://www.catalogueoflife.org/col/), and for the threats collection we used the Committee on Taxonomy (2016). As a result of these taxonomic discrepancies we obtained map risks for 114 different marine mammal species (SpID: code of the species; Sp_scName: name of the species). Here we present the GIS files (shapefiles) of the obtained risk maps for marine mammals. We also provide here the GIS file of the Species distribution of AquaMaps using the core habitat (Version 2016.8., http://www.aquamaps.org/) that we used to construct the risk maps. Risk maps differed by threat types (categories, attributes and sources), by taxa (odontocetes, mysticetes, pinnipeds and fissipeds, and sirenians) and by species. We identified 7 threat categories, 28 threat attributes and 13 threat sources affecting currently the marine mammals. The seven threat categories were based on the agent inflicting the actual harm and were: incidental catch & fishing gear interactions (BYCA), direct harvesting (DHAR), pollution (POLL), traffic (TRAF), pathogens & introduced species (INFE), resources depletion (HABI) and ocean-physics alteration (OCEA). Each of the threat categories was subdivided into a threat attribute with additional information such as type of pollution or reason for harvesting and others. Threat sources, defined as the ultimate origin of the threat, were defined following the IUCN threat classification scheme. We identified two types of threat sources, those related to direct human activities and those not. Threat sources, related to direct human activities were: aquaculture and agriculture (AQUA); fisheries (FISH), hunting and whaling (HUNT); energy production from oil, gas and mining (OGRE); energy production from nuclear power (NUCE); energy production from renewable resources (REWA); residential and industrial development (URBA); tourism and recreation (TOUR); scientific activities (SCIE); military activities (MILI); and unreported human activities (HUMA). Threat sources not related to direct human activities were climate change and geological events (CHAN). Also we identified threats resulted from sources that were unknown, unclear or unreported, but were not clearly related to direct human activities (UNKN).",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2019-08-02,DRCI:DATA2019122016147027,,

Mapping of currents is a basic requirement in planning and operating a production area for tidal energy. This paper addresses the challenge to use surface current measurements to estimate currents lower in the water column where the turbines will be deployed. A logarithmic boundary layer model is used for the vertical profile of current in a turbulent flow, with validation from published measurements. Considerations of potential and turbulent kinetic energy for a stratified water column show that the modeled vertical velocity profile can be used within limits of flow velocity at the surface, and degree of bottom roughness. The bottom roughness required to fit the logarithmic boundary layer to observed velocity profiles in this energetic flow was about 10 times larger than would normally be expected in coastal oceans. The conclusion drawn is that VHF radar surface measurements are quite well conditioned for planning and monitoring tidal energy sites.",,,,,MTS/IEEE OCEANS ConferenceMTS/IEEE OCEANS Conference,"JUN 10-14, 2013JUN 10-14, 2013","Marine Technol Soc; IEEE; IEEE Ocean Engn Soc; SFE Power; Marintek; Norwegian Def Res Estab; Inst Marine Res; Univ Bergen, Geophys Inst; Gersemia, Bekkadal Consultancy & Engn Serv; NERSCMarine Technol Soc; IEEE; IEEE Ocean Engn Soc; SFE Power; Marintek; Norwegian Def Res Estab; Inst Marine Res; Univ Bergen, Geophys Inst; Gersemia, Bekkadal Consultancy & Engn Serv; NERSC","Bergen, NORWAYBergen, NORWAY",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,0197-7385,,978-1-4799-0000-8; 978-1-4799-0002-2,,,,,,,,,"James Cook Univ, Sch Earth & Environm Sci, ACORN IMOS, TropWater & AIMS JCU, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia",,,,2014-06-11,WOS:000335313100010,,

Instrumentation will be added onto an existing high resolution physical and biological mooring program (National Science Foundation-Arctic Observing Network (AON) and RUSsian American Long-term Census of the Arctic), also supported by annual survey data. The combination of these data sets will provide urgently required, base-line information on how species presence varies seasonally with changes in sea ice, currents, ocean water temperatures and freshwater flow. Building on opportunistic proof-of-concept deployments in the strait in the last 2 years, the proposed effort will also provide critical, consistent data on interannual variability, and allow for the testing of cutting edge scientific hypotheses such as: how do oceanographic conditions dictate the residency of different marine mammal species? Are temperate species ?invading? the Arctic? What is the correlation between ice cover and marine mammal sound production? The Bering Strait is the only oceanic connection between the Pacific and the Arctic oceans. It is through this narrow (~85 km) passageway that the entire population of Bering-Chukchi-Beaufort bowhead whales passes twice yearly and that herds of beluga whales access Arctic waters. It is thought to be year-round habitat for ice seals and walrus . The Bering Strait is also the path by which Pacific sub-Arctic marine species are invading the Arctic. As the Northwest Passage becomes a viable Pacific-Atlantic shipping route, every ship along this route will pass through Bering Strait. It is, therefore, the region where climate change and changing anthropogenic utilization may have sizeable impacts on local marine fauna, and where changing fluxes of marine mammals to the Arctic can be well observed. Passive acoustic monitoring is the only method currently available to identify year-round, and in all weather conditions, the presence of marine mammals and other physical (ice movement) or anthropogenic (ships, oil and gas seismic exploration) sounds.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,1107106,,,,,,,,University of Washington,,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:13867334,,

In recent years, there has been increasing interest in the potential for oil and gas development in the Barents Sea which provides economic opportunities as well as environmental challenges for the Murmansk region.Despite the rich mineral resources and bioresources of this coastal region, Murmansk is suffering economically and is also facing severe environmental problems. It is officially recognized as the most environmentally devastated region of the Arctic. Key problems include air pollution, nuclear and other hazardous wastes, and resource depletion. Industries of the region are in need of investment for development and modernization.In order to protect the region's natural resource base and fragile ecosystem, and improve socio-economic conditions, the United Nations Development Program (UNDP)-Capacity 21, in cooperation with the government of the Russian Federation, initiated the Murmansk Region-Barents Seu Sustainable Development Project. This project aims to strengthen the capacity of institutions in the region to effectively plan and implement environmentally sustainable economic development policies and programs.Phase 1 of the UNDP project resulted in development of a Sustainable Development Action Plan (SDAP) for the region which presents action strategies and specific recommendations to strengthen the economy and environment of the Murmansk region. In preparation of the SDAP and other project activities, multi-disciplinary and inter-sectoral Task Force teams addressed a broad range of topics including coastal zone management (CZM), radioactive waste handling, mining and metallurgy, energy, and public health.This article provides a brief overview of the Murmansk Region-Barents Sea Sustainable Development Project. It then focuses on the CZM component, discussing priority environment and economic development issues for ocean and coastal areas and looking at Integrated Coastal Zone Management as a framework for addressing some of the region's needs. Specific recommendations for sustainable development of ocean and coastal areas are proposed (for fisheries, oil and gas development, shipping, waste management, etc.). The article concludes by summarizing the overall project achievements and highlighting priority programs identified by regional specialists as well as some factors influencing regional progress towards sustainable development.The Murmansk Region State Committee on Environmental Protection served as the National Executing Agency for the UNDP project. Project management and technical services were provided, under contract with UNDP, by Education Development Center, Inc. (EDC), an international NGO whose work focuses on human and organizational capacity building for sustainable development. Over 150 local and international experts collaborated on the project. Key institutions contributing to the coastal zone management component of the project were: Murmansk Marine Biological Institute (Kola Science Center); Murmansk State Committee on Environmental Protection (Marine Inspection); Knipovich Polar Research Institute of Marine Fisheries (PINRO); Urban Harbors Institute, University of Massachusetts, Boston; Fritjof Nansen Institute, Norway, and the Coastal Zone Management Centre of the Ministry of Transport, Public Works, and Water Management, The Netherlands.

GOOS will provide long-term ocean data based on a globally coordinated strategy. These data will be used for climate forecasting. The Seawatch Europe project of the European Marine environment programme (EUROMAR) is an on-line monitoring and surveillance system of the North Sea and is a regional component of GOOS. Seawatch forecasts and environmental data are distributed to public authorities, aquaculture/fish farming, commercial fishing, tourist industry, research institutes, navy and coastguards. The Seawatch system is now operative in Norway and Thailand. It is at present installed in Spain, and Indonesia Seawatch has aroused considerable interest in Sweden, The Netherlands, Greece, Italy, Mexico, China, Korea and the USA. In this paper some of the results of a benefit-cost analysis of the Seawatch System are discussed. So far the main revenues occur in the oil and gas exploitation, commercial fisheriess and fish farming, tourism, meteorological forecasting, crises management etc. It is calculated that in the North Sea, a delay of 105 minutes in startup of the productional of a well will cover the costs of Seawatch. The global potential for the Seawatch System in the Exclusive Economic Zone is an estimated 50 units of ten buoys with a running cost of $100 million per year. A strong point of the Seawatch system is that it is commercially off-the-shelf technology. Seawatch is, however, still competing with academic and governmental institutions for funds when viewed as either a research venture or an operational programme. It is important for public authorities at the national and international level to participate in Seawatch and help to steer it towards the potential it was designed to fulfil namely a building stone of GOOS.

However, their interest in it began to grow gradually during the 12th century. In this research, we verified the change in stance of medieval people toward the sea as seen in chronicles or literary works, and considered the universal relationship between man and the sea. In partiular Wace was an important witness, because this court poet, who was born on the Jersey island and served Henry II left much precious testimony about early voyages to the sea. Therefore, our work was to change nautical references from the work of Wace into electronic data, and analyze them. As a result, we were able to acquire much knowledge about the ships of the time of Wace, and the actual conditions of voyages. In this period the need for mass transportation resulted in an increased importance attached to wind-driven ships. Voyage under stormy weather and sailing into the wind were ventured. Probably many wrecks at sea would have occured. In order to consider the danger of medieval seafaring, we investigated in particular accounts of the ship wreck, one of the incidents which Wace recorded. Next, we analyzed several versions of le Roman de Tristan in which the sea is an important element of the tale. In addition, Marie de France Eliduc was also examined. In these works, the sea is not only already called an object of fear, but is also expressed as a place of trial which must be overcome for self-actualization. In coming to terms with their fear, and mastering the sea they were able to arrive at a deeper understanding and realisation of the sea, not only as a place of peril but also as a means to unprecedented wealth and opportunity.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,16520154,,,,,,,,Kobe University,,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:14145829,,

We assessed the consequences of management decisions by studying the effects of different management regimes on mangrove ecosystem services in Java, Indonesia. A novel typology of management regimes distinguishes five main categories: natural, low intensity use, high intensity use, mangroves converted for aquaculture and abandoned aquaculture. Eleven specific management regimes were distinguished, based on legal status, management activities and aquaculture indicators. We assessed and verified matching ecological characteristics per regime. We identified key ecosystem properties underpinning service provision and 'state' and 'performance' indicators for seven ecosystem services: food, raw materials, coastal protection, carbon sequestration, water purification, nursery and nature-based recreation. Service provision was estimated and scored for each regime by relating their ecological characteristics with ecosystem service indicators. Natural mangroves scored highest for most services, except for food. High food production in aquaculture occurs at the expense of other services. Transitions between management regimes were illustrated to show consequences of management decisions. This study shows the merits of quantifying multifunctionality of management regimes in mangrove systems. Our findings contributed to a common vision among Javanese decision makers to include mangrove ecosystem services in their sustainable coastal management plan. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

This landscape is juxtaposed to the adjacent Sundarbans, a pristine mangrove forest, both well connected by a dense network of tidal channels that effectively convey water and sediment throughout the region. The extensive embanking in poldered areas, however, has greatly reduced the tidal prism (i.e., volume of water) transported through local channels. We reveal that >600 km of these major waterways have infilled in recent decades, converting to land through enhanced sedimentation and the direct blocking of waterways by embankments and sluice gates. Nearly all of the observed closures (similar to 98%) have occurred along the embanked polder systems, with no comparable changes occurring in channels of the Sundarbans (<2% change). We attribute most of the channel infilling to the local reduction of tidal prism in poldered areas and the associated decline in current velocities. The infilled channels account for similar to 90 km(2) of new land in the last 40-50 years, the rate of which, similar to 2 km(2)/yr, offsets the 4 km(2)/yr that is eroded at the coast, and is equivalent to similar to 20% of the new land produced naturally at the Ganges-Brahmaputra tidal rivermouth. Most of this new land, called 'khas' in Bengali, has been reclaimed for agriculture or aquaculture, contributing to the local economy. However, benefits are tempered by the loss of navigable waterways for commerce, transportation, and fishing, as well as the forced rerouting of tidal waters and sediments necessary to sustain this low-lying landscape against rising sea level.

Using the example of a wind farm development, a typical life cycle assessment (LCA) focuses upon the primary technology inputs and their countable embodied direct impacts What LCA omits are the direct and indirect impacts of the rest of the business system that operates the primary technology, the labor, commerce and other technology employed. A total environmental assessment (TEA) would include the physical costs to the environment of the labor, commerce and other technology too.Here a simplified system energy assessment (SEA) is used to combine a top-down method of measuring implied indirect business impacts using econometric methods, with a bottom-up method of adding up the identifiable direct impact parts The top-down technique gives an inclusive but rough measure. The bottom-up technique gives a precise accounting for the directly identifiable individual parts that is highly incomplete. SEA allows these two kinds of measures to be combined for a significantly improved understanding of the whole business system and its impacts, combining the high and low precision measures indentified by each method.The key is exhaustively accounting for energy uses within the natural boundary of a whole business system as a way of calibrating the measure. That allows defining a standardized measure of complex distributed system energy flows and their energy returns on invested energy resources (EROI). The method is demonstrated for a generic business operation. Starting from the easily accountable inputs and outputs, SEA successively uses larger natural system boundaries to discover a way of finding the limiting value of EROI after all parts of the whole are included Some business choices and a net present value model of cash flow for the 20 year project help illustrate the related financial Issues. The business model used shows that the EROI of a generic Texas Wind Farm is 31 when accounting for direct and indirect fuels only, but decreases to 4-6 after accounting for the economic energy consumed by all necessary business units and services.",,,,,Proceedings of the ASME 4th International Conference on Energy Sustainability 2010Proceedings of the ASME 4th International Conference on Energy Sustainability 2010,"MAY 17-22, 2010MAY 17-22, 2010","ASME, Adv Energy Syst Div; ASME, Solar Energy DivASME, Adv Energy Syst Div; ASME, Solar Energy Div","Phoenix, AZPhoenix, AZ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,978-0-7918-4394-9,,,,,,,,,"Univ Texas Austin, Ctr Int Energy & Environm Policy, Austin, TX 78712 USA",,,,2010-01-01,WOS:000283271100105,,

Although the Master Deed has had some successes since its introduction in 2003, its effectiveness in reducing the time and cost of asset transfers in the UKCS has been hindered by an inconsistent application of legal principles and the overtly adversarial legal and commercial culture that prevails in the UKCS. The UKCS's viability to continue as a profitable producing basin is currently under threat as margins are squeezed by high producing costs and low commodity prices. During such times of increased financial pressure, it is imperative that regulators react to these challenges by developing and nurturing a regulatory environment that reduces administrative obstacles associated with asset transfers encouraging greater liquidity and investment. This article argues that with the support of a proactive and collaborative regulator, which safeguards the consistent application of transfer provisions, discards outdated methodologies and fosters a more collaborative culture between UKCS participants, the UKCS transfer regime has the potential to be one of the most dynamic and user friendly regimes of its kind. Maximizing the effectiveness of the transfer regime will ensure that the UKCS remains a competitive environment to carry out oil and gas operations, elongating its producing life and increasing overall hydrocarbon recovery.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,1754-9957,1754-9965,,,,,,,,,,"Andrews Kurths Corp Oil & Gas Team, Houston, TX 77002 USA",Andrews Kurths Corp Oil & Gas Team,,,2016-05-11,WOS:000374222900005,,

However, being in an initial step of development, extracting energy from the ocean is often regarded as difficult and uneconomical. The existing models for assessing marine energy costs are often oversimplified, leading to uncertainties that may hold investors back and slow down the market penetration of this renewable. Therefore, an accurate prediction of marine energy costs is fundamental to drawing conclusions about its competitiveness. Among the different possibilities of marine energy, this paper focuses on the economic analysis of tidal, wave, and offshore wind energy. The individual costs involved in the construction of these offshore energy parks and operation and maintenance tasks during their lifetime are determined. With this information, the levelized cost ((sic)/MW h) is calculated for offshore wind, wave and tidal energy ((sic)165/MW h, (sic)225/MW h and (sic)190/MW h, respectively). It is found that these renewables have a higher energy cost than traditional energy sources; however, considering factors such as the learning rate or externalities enhances their competitiveness. In the second part of this paper, combined energy systems, such as hybrid converters, are presented as a future solution to boost the development of marine energies. The synergies between these renewables are outlined, as well as the cost savings that can be achieved through diversified energy systems.

J,,,,,,,,,John Williams,,Containment risk Mitigation in Indian CO2 Storage (COMICS),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Awarded Grant,Oct 17 2019,2019,"As a signatory to the December 2015 Paris Agreement, India is committed to joining the global community in stabilising global temperature rise to well below 2 degrees Centigrade. Rapidly growing economies such as India are faced with the challenge of reducing emissions from the heavy industry and power sectors while ensuring continued economic growth. Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS), where CO2 is removed from flue gases and injected into deep geological formations for permanent disposal, is recognised by the IPCC as an essential technology for meeting climate goals at least cost. While high-level studies have identified some potential for CO2 storage in India, a perception remains that injected CO2 may migrate upwards from the intended storage reservoir towards the surface. Lack of fundamental research that addresses this issue prohibits detailed assessment of the potential for CCS to contribute to emission reductions in India.COMICS will establish an international partnership to understand the potential for safe and secure CO2 storage in India's sedimentary basins. The team comprises researchers from the British Geological Survey (BGS) and two leading Indian research institutes engaged in CCS, the Indian Institute of Technology Bombay (IITB) and the National Geophysical Research Institute (NGRI). A new £0.5M project announced by the Indian Government's Ministry of Science and Technology 'A systematic large scale assessment for potential of CO2 enhanced oil and natural gas recovery in key sedimentary basins in India' is led by IITB. The project comprises research groups; Indian Institute of Management Ahmadabad, Indian Institute of Technology Roorkee, and industrial partners; Oil and Natural Gas Corporation, National Thermal Power Corporation, Essar Oil and Gas, and the West Bengal Power Development Corporation.COMICS will complement the new Indian-funded project, combining local knowledge and expertise of the Indian consortium with the experience of the BGS CO2 storage research team. BGS has been active in CO2 research for over two decades, and undertakes related research in overburden properties, fluid-migration process, and monitoring requirements, funded by combination of UKRI (such as the current NERC Migration of CO2 through North Sea Geological Carbon Storage Sites, UK Carbon Capture and Storage Research Centre 2017) and EC H2020 projects (such as SECURe and ENOS). Our current research portfolio is worth over £5M. The COMICS project will extend these endeavours to include Indian data acquired through the new partnership, bringing new insights to CO2 storage processes in a region recognised as being vital to meeting regional and global climate ambitions.The project will initially focus on the Cambay Basin, where the Oil and Natural Gas Corporation have proposed a pilot CO2 injection project for enhanced oil recovery. The assessment of CO2 containment risks and monitoring and conformance requirements imposed by the specific geological setting are critically important. Based on the scientific research undertaken by COMICS, recommendations for safe and secure CO2 storage in the region will be developed. The research will underpin future research and development activities, including the development of new pilot CO2 injection studies. The results will also support nascent policy and commercial development of CCS through collaboration with industrial partners and state-owned companies engaged in the parallel Government of India-funded project. Facilitating CO2 emission reductions in India through targeted research activities is a key aim of COMICS. The proposed activities are aimed at securing future joint research opportunities for UK-India collaboration through Mission Innovation, existing UKRI programmes, and transnational UK Government (BEIS) funding to foster research and innovation related to accelerating CCS technologies.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,NE/T004649/1,,,,,,,,NERC British Geological Survey,,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:15354559,,

Blue mussels were collected from: (1) a steel cage at a depth of 3 m on 20 August 1999, (2) an enclosure at depths of 3-5 m, and (3) an artificial reef (wreck at 25-30 m) in the western Gulf of Finland between June and September 2000. Furthermore, blue mussels were collected from two sites between August and October 2000: south of the town of Hanko at depths of 5 and 20 m in the western Gulf of Finland and south of the city of Helsinki at a depth of 7 m in the central Gulf of Finland. M. balthica and D. polymorpha were collected at a depth of 12 m from Russian waters in the eastern Gulf of Finland on 1-4 August 2000. The samples were analyzed for the cyanobacterial hepatotoxins nodularin (NODLN) and microcystins (MCs) using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS), and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS). ELISA indicated a time-dependent accumulation of hepatotoxins in flounder liver up to 400 +/- 10 (SD) mug/kg on 25 August 2000. No hepatotoxins were detected in flounder muscle samples. In blue mussels, collected from an enclosure 3-5 m deep in the western Gulf of Finland on 23 August 2000, ELISA indicated cyanobacterial hepatotoxins up to 1490 +/- 60 mug/kg dry wt. Blue mussels collected from the other sites contained less cyanobacterial hepatotoxins (40-130 mug/kg dry wt). Clams and mussels from Russian waters contained cyanobacterial hepatotoxin at about 100-130 mug/kg dry wt. Total hepatotoxin levels in mussels from enclosures decreased from August to September, indicating at least partial detoxication/depuration of the toxins. LC-MS verified the presence of NODLN in mussels and flounder. Typical detoxication conjugates were observed by MALDI-TOF-MS in mussel samples collected during August 2000. In deeper-living wreck mussels cyanobacterial hepatotoxin levels continued to increase, from August to September, indicating that portions of cyanobacterial hepatotoxins reach the sea floor. NODLN bioaccumulation is a constant phenomenon in the area.

Disposal methods include surface water discharge. The current field method used to determine its fate in estuarine systems involves extending a compass oriented transect (COT) from the point source discharge-a method designed for a uniformly dispersing effluent discharged into a uniform offshore environment that may be inappropriate for the hydrologic and geomorphologic complexities found in estuarine systems. Prior research established the viability of the salinity stratification transect (SST) method. Both COT and SST methods were used in a small open bay to determine which more accurately detected effluent dispersion. Determination was based on sediment contaminant indicators (SCIs), including interstitial salinity, hydrocarbons, metals, and radium concentrations. Additionally, SCIs were evaluated for their ability to serve as indicators of effluent dispersion. The data revealed that SST stations exhibited higher contaminant concentrations and that this approach was more accurate in tracking the produced water plume. The data also suggested that SCIs varied in their ability to serve as indicators. Good indicators included interstitial salinity, total targeted aromatic hydrocarbons substantiated with a modified fossil fuel pollution index value, certain metals, and radium-228.

This is made possible by deployment of instrumentation on remotely operated vehicles used for providing power and data flow and for precise positioning on targets of interest. Early prototype systems have now been replaced by compact and robust units that have been deployed well over 100 times on an expeditionary basis over a very wide range of ocean depths without failure. Real-time access to the spectra obtained in the vehicle control room allows for expedition decision making. Quantification of some of the solutes in seawater or pore waters observed in the spectra is made possible by self-referencing to the ubiquitous v(2) water bending peak. The applications include detection of the structure and composition of complex thermogenic gas hydrates both occurring naturally on the sea floor and in controlled sea floor experiments designed to simulate the growth of such natural systems. New developments in the ability to probe the chemistry of sediment pore waters in situ, long thought impossible candidates for Raman study due to fluorescence observed in recovered samples, have occurred. This permits accurate measurement of the abundance of dissolved methane and sulfide in sediment pore waters. In areas where a high gas flux is observed coming out of the sediments a difference of about X30 between in situ Raman measurement and the quantity observed in recovered cores has been found. New applications under development include the ability to address deep-sea biological processes and the ability to survey the sea floor chemical conditions associated with potential sub-sea geologic CO2 disposal in abandoned oil and gas fields.",,,,,,,,,49,11,0,0,16,0,59,,,0003-7028,1943-3530,,,,,,,,,,"Monterey Bay Aquarium Res Inst, Moss Landing, CA 95039 USAChinese Acad Sci, Key Lab Marine Geol & Environm, Inst Oceanol, Qingdao 266071, Shandong, Peoples R China",,,,2012-03-01,WOS:000300599300002,22449300,

A grid of 22 coastal and offshore stations Was sampled to investigate the extent of spilled oil and to screen for chemical contamination, as well as to evaluate the behavior of the oil at the air-sea interface. Samples were collected from the sea surface microlayer (SML) and from subsurface waters (SSW) at each station. The fuel oil spilled (IFO 380) was also analyzed. The determination of oil-related hydrocarbons (aliphatic hydrocarbons, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), terpanes, and steranes) and the screening for other harmful chemicals on the inventory of the MSC Napoli in the seawater samples, was performed by PTV-GC/MS using large volume injection (LVI) techniques, Screening did not reveal the presence of any harmful chemicals other than petroleum-related compounds. Results afforded investigation of oil sources and spatial distributions of total PAH concentrations and enrichments in the sea surface microlayer (SML). Bather than a single source, oil fingerprinting analyses of the samples revealed a mixture of three types of oil: heavy fuel oil, lubricating oil, and a lighter oil (probably diesel oil). Enrichment factors (EF) in the SMIL (EF = C-SML/C-SSW) were calculated and, in the vicinity of the ship, approached 2000, declining with distance away from the wreck. These factors represent approximately a 1000-fold enrichment over typical coastal total PAH enrichments in the SML and reflected a clear petrogenic origin of the contamination (as demonstrated, for example, by a FI/Py ratio <1). In addition, the spatial transport and fate (i.e., air-sea exchange processes and water column diffusion) of the oil-related hydrocarbons in the sea surface were investigated. Essentially, near the wreck, the SML was highly enriched in oil forming a visible sheen, both disrupting the normal air-seawater exchange processes and generating a downward diffusion flux of contaminants from the SML to the SSW. This was reflected by a higher occurrence of naphthalene relative to alkyl-naphthalenes in the SSW compared to the SML. The higher concentrations and different sources of oil found in the SML in comparison to those found in the SSW indicate that, if only subsurface water samples are investigated in isolation, the true extent and impact of a spill could be underestimated.

Because most of offshore works take place in the middle of the ocean, ‘Ship’ plays a major role in all offshore related services. Offshore Support Vessels (hereinafter OSV) are specially designed ships for the logistical servicing of offshore platforms, transportation, installations, anchor handling and multi-purposes.In offshore marine contracting for OSV chartering, Owner and Charterer sign the contract for Time Charter party in many cases in a view of hiring during a certain period. In these cases, it requires any standard and regular contract format. As one of the Time Charter parties, SUPPLYTIME is a standard contract used by offshore industry to charter vessels for offshore marine operations, can be used on everything from half-day charters to the long term of several years.SUPPLYTIME was first introduced in 1975 to meet the demand for a specialized contract for chartering of offshore support vessels. It has later been revised three times to reflect current industry practice and developments first in 1989, then in 2005 and now in 2017. Above all, SUPPLYTIME 2005 has been very popular and is still widely used more frequently than the latest edition in the market. A number of researches have been conducted on NYPE(New York Produce Exchange) or BALTIME, which are charter party for a general cargo ship. However, relatively it seems much lack in study for SUPPLYTIME for the OSV time chartering except for the analysis of dispute resolution and some other terms.This thesis is a presentation of the analysis of general content, specific characteristics compared to NYPE, BALTIME and other time charter party standards, and it deals with the main functions and interpretation standards on the legal relationship between Owner and Charterer centered on the key clauses of SUPPLYTIME 2005. Some of the conflicts and disputes that may arise due to the unambiguous interpretation of the standard terms or not set forth defined in clauses shall be introduced.

However, working on the seabed can have leakage or cost problems. As one of solutions, the surface-tie-in method so called stalk-on method is used in the shallow water. In this method, the riser is welded to the pipeline which is lifted over the sea surface, and the welded pipeline-riser is lowered to the target position.The main purpose of this paper is to demonstrate the safety evaluation procedure of the stalk-on operation and to share the experience learnt from actual field application. For the sake of the safety evaluation, the stalk-on operation is divided into 3 phases which are the phases of lifting a pipeline by davit cranes, holding a lifted-pipeline and lowering the weld-connected pipeline and the riser.

This method makes it possible to obtain a large number of realizations of these conditions at a certain location. It is shown that the operational windows remain persistent with the original limited dataset.

To illustrate the value of this method, an application regarding replacement maintenance of a tidal energy infrastructure is examined. For this purpose, the maintenance activities are represented as a semi-Markov decision process.

Context-specific understanding of forest vegetation communities, their dynamics, and underlying drivers is needed for future restoration strategies. In this study we examined relationships between soil (chemical and physical) and environmental (landscape and topographical) characteristics, plant community attributes, and carbon stocks during early secondary succession. Data were collected at two sites undergoing early secondary succession in seasonally-dry Atlantic Forest (Rio de Janeiro State, Brazil). Both sites were previously used for pasture and abandoned at similar times, but showed differing vegetation communities. We found tree biomass and diversity and ecosystem carbon storage to be strongly positively related to the amount of surrounding forest, less steep slopes and clay soils, and negatively to the abundance of the shrub Leandra aurea. Soil carbon pools significantly increased with aboveground tree biomass. The only factor significantly affecting the metric of overall successional development (combining tree biomass and diversity) was total surrounding forest cover. Our findings suggest recovery of secondary forest and below-and aboveground carbon storage is limited by the amount of adjacent forest, some soil properties and dense shrub establishment down-regulating the succession process.

The vessels lost covered a wide range of underwater orientation and water depths and so provided a perfect suite of corrosion experiments. Since the fuel on board the aircraft was either readily burnt at the time or was lost through volatilization, the wrecked planes present no pollution problems today. However the bunker fuel kept inside on-board storage tanks does present a real conservation management crisis.

Achieving net-zero CO2 emissions will require carbon capture and storage (CCS) to reduce current GHG emission rates, and negative emissions technology (NET) to recapture previously emitted greenhouse gases. Delivering NET requires radical cost and regulatory innovation to impact on climate mitigation. Present NET exemplars are few, are at small-scale and not deployable within a decade, with the exception of rock weathering, or direct injection of CO2 into selected ocean water masses. To keep warming less than 2 degrees C, bioenergy with CCS (BECCS) has been modelled but does not yet exist at industrial scale. CCS already exists in many forms and at low cost. However, CCS has no political drivers to enforce its deployment. We make a new analysis of all global CCS projects and model the build rate out to 2050, deducing this is 100 times too slow. Our projection to 2050 captures just 700 Mt CO2 yr(-1), not the minimum 6000 Mt CO2 yr(-1) required to meet the 2 degrees C target. Hence new policies are needed to incentivize commercial CCS. A first urgent action for all countries is to commercially assess their CO2 storage. A second simple action is to assign a Certificate of CO2 Storage onto producers of fossil carbon, mandating a progressively increasing proportion of CO2 to be stored. No CCS means no 2 degrees C.This article is part of the theme issue 'The Paris Agreement: understanding the physical and social challenges for a warming world of 1.5 degrees C above pre-industrial levels'.",,,,,,,,,192,1,0,0,17,0,205,,,1364-503X,1471-2962,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Edinburgh, Sch GeoSci, Edinburgh EH9 3FE, Midlothian, Scotland",,,,2018-04-19,WOS:000429046300003,29610379,

In this research the seabed was assumed to be a fluid-saturated poroelasic medium whose behavior is governed by Biot's theory of wave propagation. Dynamic responses of a caisson structure with suction and seabed around it were numerically evaluated for wave pressures acting on the front surface of the caisson, which were measured under the irregular wave in the experimental basin. The effects of the skirt length and suction on the dynamic response of caisson structure foundation were numerically investigated for some material properties of seabed foundation.The results obtained in this research is summarized as follows :1)The displacement response of seabed under a caisson structure greatly depends on the skirt length of a caisson structure as seen in the displacement response of a caisson itself.2)It is necessary to give careful consideration to the behavior of both the displacement and phase responses in case of installing a caisson structure with suction on the seabed, whose stiffness and shear wave velocity are small.3)The dynamic response of pore water pressure under caisson has a maximum value in the vicinity of compartments, and also gradually decreases with the distance from the bottom of caisson increasing.4)The pore water pressure response in seabed foundation depends on not only the suction and frictional force acting on the skirt part of a caisson structure but also the stiffness of seabed around it.5)The caisson with suction is effective in soft seabed and has superiority in the cases of the lower permeability of seabed, the more providing compartments.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,7650584,,,,,,,,Maizuru National College of Technology,Maizuru National College of Technology,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:14287434,,

As such, fatigue assessment methods play a critical role in identifying and subsequently managing fatigue in offshore operators. The aims of this observational study were to explore the effect of offshore shiftwork on physiological and subjective fatigue outcomes. Ten male operators (age: 31.3 (6.1) years; stature: 1.72 (0.1) m; weight: 85.24 (9.8) kg) were monitored throughout their daily shifts for six days on an offshore drillship using intrinsically safer physiological sensors that recorded various physiological parameters. Additionally, existing subjective fatigue scales from the literature were employed to obtain perceptions of fatigue. Six of the ten operators underwent swing shift in the middle of the data collection period. Physiological results indicate that overall average heart rate (an indicator of fatigue) were elevated for all operators and remained elevated for those who started and ended their work on the day shift. Operators' subjective reports of fatigue were relatively high for acute fatigue and intershift recovery as well as for lack of effort and sleepiness; however, the physiological measures were not consistently correlated with the subjective measures of fatigue. The study outcomes identified a critical gap in fatigue assessment in OGE operations; existing fatigue surveys for the general (or other) working populations are not comprehensive of OGE operations and are thus not applicable for OGE workers, nor are they validated against physiological fatigue outcomes in OGE workers.

In the GLOBEC Northeast Pacific (NEP) program, population modeling has been useful in assessing potential explanations of population behavior observed in field studies and associated retrospective analyses. A recent retrospective analysis of catch records of chinook salmon, coho salmon and Dungeness crab and associated physical variables in the California Current System (CCS) indicated these three species were influenced by the same set of physical conditions in the CCS, i.e., whether it was a warm water year with a weaker California Current and weaker upwelling, as determined by semibasin-scale conditions in the Pacific. However, this analysis also raised questions such as why did coho salmon populations collapse uniformly along Washington,. Oregon, and California, in the mid-1970s, while chinook salmon populations did not? A possible explanation is that chinook salmon have more variable life histories. Analysis of one source of greater variability, the spawning age structure, indicated that while populations that spawn over more ages are more persistent, that effect is not a likely explanations for the observed difference because coho salmon are not strictly obligate semelparous. The observed differences in response in the mid-1970s may be due to differences in effects of the physical environment at some point in their marine life history, probably the early ocean phase. The metapopulation dynamics created by straying between populations could also contribute to a difference in persistence. Our work thus far on metapopulation aspects has involved showing that even the relatively low typical straying rates can have a substantial effect on persistence. A second question raised by the retrospective analysis was how can these three species be driven by the same physical conditions, yet respond on such different time scales (i.e., annual to 10-year)? The answer to this question lies in differences in the shape of the stock-recruitment functions, and age structure, among the three species. We outline additional needs for further retrospective and modeling analyses.",,,,,Symposium on Fisheries in a Changing ClimateSymposium on Fisheries in a Changing Climate,"AUG 20-21, 2001AUG 20-21, 2001",Amer Fisheries SocAmer Fisheries Soc,"PHOENIX, AZPHOENIX, AZ",1,0,0,0,2,0,2,,,0892-2284,,1-888569-40-9,,,,,,,,,"Univ Calif Davis, Dept Wildlife Fish & Conservat Biol, Davis, CA 95616 USA",,,,2002-01-01,WOS:000178304200016,,

The UBGH2 logged 13 sites and cored 10 sites to locate potential sites for an offshore test production. A total of 211 conventional cores were recovered. Undrained shear strength, thermal conductivity, and index properties, including porosity and grain density, were measured onboard. Mineral composition analyses and grain size analyses were completed onshore after the expedition.The averaged porosity at each site ranges from 65% to 71%, the averaged grain density at each site ranges from 2.57 to 2.66 g/cm(3), and the mean grain size mostly lies between 4 mu m and 25 mu m, with sparsely scattered coarse grained intervals. The relatively high porosity and low grain density are due to the large portion of diatomaceous sediments. The thermal conductivities average around 0.8 W/mK, and the low porosity and the abundance of clay mineral and OAPL-A may have caused the relatively low thermal conductivity in the Ulleung Basin.The geomechanical analyses revealed a few relevant findings important for sediment physical behaviors during gas hydrate production. The particle migration in coarse grained layers during production necessitates proper measure for sand productions while fine grained layers are mostly self-filtering. The vertical deformation estimated from the compression index suggested that the subsidence induced by the pore pressure change from the depressurization is much higher than those induced by the lost of gas hydrate particles from dissociation. Massive vertical deformation in fine-grained layers has been predicted to occur due to the pore pressure change from depressurization induced gas hydrate production. The drilling mud weight induced pressure window is mostly determined by the water depth in deep sea drilling, but caution should be taken in determination of fracture pressures in hydrate-bearing sediments, because gas hydrate saturations alter Poisson's ratio.

Environmental risk is further investigated by using the risk matrix approach, which evaluates both frequency and severity of oil spill. The methodology is applied to the case of a real oil platform in the Barents Sea. A set of simulations on how the platform is conducted demonstrated that the proposed method may be suitable for risk analysis in such critical conditions. It also showed that dynamic risk assessment may allow identifying critical safety barrier elements, whose correct performance needs to be prioritized to control risk.

The concept of sustainability also has come to include adapting to climate change and the associated dynamic timber markets. This study aims to: (1) incorporate several ESs indicators in a Forest Management Decision Support System (FMDSS) that can deal with climate change and dynamic timber markets; and (2) analyse the impact that intensified forest management, resulting from global change scenarios that represent different levels of climate change mitigation efforts, will have on forest ES indicators in the west of Ireland. A linear programming model that optimized Net Present Value (NPV) from mill-gate sales was previously developed in Remsoft Woodstock, a DSS framework used for strategic forest planning around the world. This Woodstock model was modified to include the effects of global scenarios that include climate change and dynamic timber prices. This model was further developed to include indicators for five ESs (carbon storage in the forest as well as in harvested wood products and carbon substitution, windthrow risk, biodiversity, water quality, and cultural values), to assess the impacts of these global scenarios on the forest landscape and the sustainability of forest management. The ES indicator values were mainly linked to forest age, forest type, and yield tables, and their inclusion in the FMDSS had almost no impact on total model run times. Intensified forest clearfelling, as a result of increasing timber prices associated with most global scenarios, led to increased phosphor emissions to waterbodies, and reductions in windthrow risk and carbon storage. The global scenarios only resulted in minor differences in the indicator values for biodiversity and cultural values. Besides the global scenarios, recent forest policy development and the poor soil conditions in the study area impacted on the results. The developed system, with its innovative method to incorporate climate change and associated market dynamics, could be applied to other forest landscapes in Ireland and Europe, or indeed by any forest company or organization that uses Remsoft Woodstock.

This paper presents an integrated sedimentological and geochemical study of the Dariyan Formation at four oil and gas fields located in the western, central and eastern parts of the Gulf. Facies stacking patterns in general indicate shallowing-upwards trends toward the exposure surfaces, which are interpreted to correspond to unconformities. The Dariyan Formation in the study area is divided into upper and lower carbonate units by a deep-water, high-gamma shale-marl interval. At fields in the western and central Gulf, significant diagenetic changes were recorded in the top of the upper carbonate unit, including meteoric dissolution and cementation, brecciation and paleosol formation. An exposure surface is also present at the top of the lower carbonate unit in all the fields in the study area, and is associated with meteoric dissolution and cementation of grain-dominated facies. Age calibration of studied intervals was carried out using microfossil assemblages including benthic and planktonic foraminifera. Negative excursions of both O-18 (-10 parts per thousand VPDB) and C-13 (-0.66 parts per thousand VPDB) were recorded in weathered intervals located below the unconformity surfaces. A sequence stratigraphic framework for the Dariyan Formation was established by integrating sedimentological, palaeontological and geochemical data. The C-13 curve for the formation in the Iranian sector of the Persian Gulf can be correlated with the reference curve for the northern Neotethys and used as a basis for regional stratigraphic correlation. Where the top-Aptian unconformity is present, it has resulted in an enhancement of the reservoir characteristics of the underlying carbonate succession. Accordingly, the best reservoir zones in the Dariyan Formation occur in the upper parts of the lower and upper carbonate units which are bounded above by significant palaeo-exposure surfaces.",,,,,,,,,23,0,0,0,4,0,23,,,0141-6421,1747-5457,,,,,,,,,,"Shiraz Univ, Dept Earth Sci, Fac Sci, Shiraz, IranUniv Tehran, Sch Geol, Coll Sci, Tehran, IranUniv Windsor, Dept Earth & Environm Sci, Windsor, ON, CanadaIranian Offshore Oil Co, Tehran, IranAbdal Ind Projects Management Co MAPSA, Tehran, IranUniv Isfahan, Dept Geol, Esfahan, Iran",Iranian Offshore Oil CoAbdal Ind Projects Management Co MAPSA,,,2018-12-28,WOS:000445621100003,,

It is not known if this population is distinct from porpoise in the GOA stock found outside Cook Inlet. No long-term dedicated studies of harbor porpoise have occurred in Cook Inlet. The objective here is to provide a summary of occurrence in Cook Inlet derived from archaeological data, anecdotal reports, and systematic surveys. Maps were created for each dataset. For 1,500 years, Alutiiq Eskimo subsistence societies occupied lower Cook Inlet until abandoning the region around 600 A. D. During that time, harbor porpoise exploitation increased and eventually made up over one-third of the faunal remains by number at midden sites. The Dena'ina and Chugach Alutiiq continued porpoise hunting into the period of early contact in the late 1700's, after which there is no mention of continued exploitation. Harbor porpoise were rarely mentioned in expedition accounts collected by naturalists in the late 1800's and early 1900's. Beginning in 1958, pelagic fur seal, Callorhinus ursinus, investigators collected cetacean sightings in Alaska waters when seals were not present. However, none of the harbor porpoise sightings occurred in Cook Inlet. With the exception of one net entanglement in upper Cook Inlet in 1956, sightings and strandings (including fisheries bycatch) were not reported in the inlet until the mid-1970's. Interactions with fisheries factored in a quarter of the stranded animals recovered in Cook Inlet. Systematic surveys of bird and marine mammal populations increased during the 1970's and continued sporadically to the present day. One dedicated harbor porpoise aerial survey conducted in August 1991 estimated the population at 136 (CV = 63.2%), but this survey did not include the shoreline and many of the bays throughout Cook Inlet. An uncorrected abundance of 249 (CV = 60.7%) in June 1998 was based on offshore sightings obtained during beluga whale, Delphinapterus leucas, aerial surveys. The largest abundance estimate, 428 harbor porpoise (95% C.I. 26-830), was obtained during vessel surveys designed to count sea-birds in lower Cook Inlet during the summer of 1993. Harbor porpoise sighting rates, abundance, and density estimates often were limited by survey area, effort, research platform, and study design. Therefore, each of these estimates is likely biased downward. In the last decade the region has seen expansion of the Port of Anchorage, proposals to build a bridge crossing Knik Arm, plans to develop mining operations and supporting infrastructure, hydrokinetic energy generation proposals, oil and gas seismic exploration, and water quality effects from urban areas. The overall effect on harbor porpoise within the confines of Cook Inlet cannot be fully determined until we understand the genetic and demographic population structure of this highly mobile and cryptic species.",,,,,,,,,2,0,0,0,2,0,2,,,0090-1830; 1939-2044,,,,,,,,,,,"NOAA, Natl Marine Mammal Lab, 7600 Sand Point Way NE, Seattle, WA, 98115, USA",,,,2015-02-17,ZOOREC:ZOOR15102010337,,

Flow lines are used to transport oil and gas well stream from the wellhead to the production manifold. They are categorised as one of the most critical components on a production facility. Flow line degradation takes place due to corrosion and erosion. The deterioration of a flowline may increase the risk of leakages, ruptures, etc., which shall lead to serious HSE (health, safety and environmental) and financial consequences. Any such risks have a direct impact on the O&G installation's technical integrity as well as the operator's sustainability concerns. Conventionally, pipelines are designed with safety provisions to provide a theoretical minimum failure rate over the life span. Furthermore, to reduce the risk of failure various techniques are routinely used to monitor the status of pipelines during the operation phase. The existing methods of flowline health monitoring planning requires one to take into consideration the operator's plant strategy, flowline degradation mechanisms, historical data, etc.A technical condition report is made based on findings' reports and degradation trends. This report recommends the inspection of a number of points on the flowlines in a certain year using non-destructive evaluation methods such as visual inspection, ultrasonic testing, radiographic testing, etc. Based on the technical condition report, in general for a certain preventive maintenance shutdown, 10 to 15 flowline inspection openings are accommodated as finance, time and resource availability are taken into consideration. However, it is customary to plan to open more locations in a certain inspection package than can be inspected and minimization of such points is at present done on an ad hoc basis. This paper suggests a formal model and a framework to formally minimize the number of visual inspections by executing the plant strategy as well as HSE concerns. The model is derived using analytic hierarchy process (AHP) framework, which is a multi-criteria decision-making approach.

Understanding how these changes potentially cascade across marine and freshwater ecosystems requires knowing how mobile euryhaline species link these seemingly-disparate systems. As upper trophic level predators, bull sharks (Carcharhinus leucas) play a crucial role in marine and freshwater ecosystem health. Telemetry studies in Mobile Bay, Alabama suggest that bull sharks extensively use the northern portions of the bay, an estuarine-freshwater interface known as the Mobile-Tensaw Delta. To assess whether bull sharks use freshwater habitats in this region, environmental DNA surveys were conducted during the dry summer and wet winter seasons in 2018. In each season, 5 x1 L water samples were collected at each of 21 sites: five sites in Mobile Bay, six sites in the Mobile-Tensaw Delta, and ten sites throughout the Mobile-Tombigbee and Tensaw-Alabama Rivers. Water samples were vacuum-filtered, DNA extractions were performed on the particulate, and DNA extracts were analyzed with Droplet Digital Polymerase Chain Reaction using species-specific primers and an internal probe to amplify a 237-base pair fragment of the mitochondrial NADH dehydrogenase subunit 2 gene in bull sharks. One water sample collected during the summer in the Alabama River met the criteria for a positive detection, thereby confirming the presence of bull shark DNA. While preliminary, this finding suggests that bull sharks use less urbanized, riverine habitats up to 120 km upriver during Alabamas dry summer season. Water samples were collected at a series of estuarine, deltaic, and freshwater sites in Alabama once in the wet winter season (February 19-20, 2018) and once in the dry summer season (August 21-22, 2018). In total, five estuarine sites were sampled from Dauphin Island to the northern extent of Mobile Bay, six sites were sampled within the MTD, and ten freshwater sites were sampled in two river systems: the Mobile-Tombigbee and the Tensaw-Alabama. In each river system, sites spanned ~190 km north of the mouth to just south of the Coffeeville Lock and Dam and Claiborne Lock and Dam in the Tombigbee and Alabama Rivers, respectively (Fig. 1A). All sampling sites were spaced 15-25 km apart (Fig. 1A). At each site, 5  1 L water samples and environmental data, including temperature (C°), salinity (psu), dissolved oxygen (mg/L), and depth (m), were collected approximately 0.5 m below the surface of the water. While bull sharks are known to use the entire water column, previous studies have identified surface water sampling as the most suitable method for eDNA collection in headwaters (Katano et al. 2017). In Mobile Bay, water samples were collected in proximity to structures (e.g., oil rig, lighthouse), and at all riverine sites, samples were collected across the width of the river. All eDNA field and laboratory protocols and controls followed Schweiss et al. (2020), and new gloves were used at each sampling site. Water samples were collected in the field using sterile, 1 L high-density polyethylene Nalgene bottles and stored on ice in clean marine coolers, or frozen, until water filtration (see Schweiss et al., 2020). In addition to the filtration, DNA extraction, and PCR negative controls described in Schweiss et al. (2020), negative collection controls were also included. The negative collection controls consisted of autoclaved deionized water, which was taken onto the boat and placed in a clean marine cooler on ice with field samples to test for field contamination (e.g., Jerde et al., 2011). All negative control samples (collection, filtration, DNA extraction, and PCR) were processed and analyzed in replicates of five, according to the protocols of Schweiss et al. (2020), and were defined as negative if they did not meet any of the criteria for positive detections. Water samples were vacuum-filtered in a laboratory using 47-mm-diameter, 0.8-mum nylon filters (Cole Parmer, Illinois, USA) and preserved in 95% ethanol at room temperature (see Schweiss et al., 2020). Total eDNA was extracted from of each filter following the Goldberg et al. (2016) QIAGEN DNeasy Blood & Tissue Kit protocol incorporating the QIAshredder spin columns. A species-specific bull shark Droplet Digital PCR (ddPCR) assay was used to target a 237-base pair fragment of the mitochondrial NADH dehydrogenase subunit 2 (mtDNA ND2) gene using the reaction mixtures and ddPCR cycling conditions described in Schweiss et al. (2020). Five replicates (5% of the total eDNA extract) were run for each sample on the Bio-Rad QX200 AutoDG Droplet Digital PCR System (Droplet Generator instrument no. 773BR1456, Droplet Reader instrument no. 771BR2544) platform. Positive detections were defined as samples with at least one ddPCR replicate that met all three analysis criteria: 1) droplets were above the manual threshold of 3,000 amplitude, 2) droplets were within the known positive droplet range for the target species (e.g., 4,500-6,000 amplitude), and 3) the concentration (copies/muL) was greater than or equal to the refined Limit of Detection (LoD) of 0.09 copies/muL for the assay, using the Rare Event Detection (RED) analysis in Bio-Rad QuantaSoft software.

We combine these data with historical aspects of marine vectors in order to get insights into how Tubastraea species have successfully spread around the world, established and invaded and where future studies would be best focused. T. coccinea and T. tagusensis are recognized as being highly invasive and are causing significant environmental, economic, and social impacts requiring management actions. The third species, T. micranthus so far only reported outside its native range on oil platforms, may have similar potential for negative impact. The vectors of introduction of Tubastraea may have changed throughout history and the biological invasion of these invasive corals may reflect changing practices, demands and legislation in shipping activities over the years.

The silt-clay and total organic carbon contents of the sediments poorly correlated with the pollutant concentrations.

We asked whether continued warming will affect the distribution of six common canopy-forming species: mid-intertidal fucoids (Ascophyllum nodosum, Fucus vesiculosus), low-intertidal Irish moss (Chondrus crispus), subtidal laminarian kelps (Saccharina latissima, Laminaria digitata) and the invasive Codium fragile. Location Northwest Atlantic. Methods We used occurrence records and the correlative presence-only species distribution model Maxent to determine present-day distribution. This distribution was compared to each species' warm-water physiological thresholds indicating areas of stable or reduced growth and mortality. Present-day models were then projected to mid-century (2040-2050) and end-century (2090-2100) using two contrasting carbon emission scenarios (RCP2.6 and 8.5) and two global climate models from CMIP5 based on changes in ocean temperatures. Results Projected range shifts were minimal under low emissions (RCP2.6), but substantial species-specific range shifts were projected under high emissions (RCP8.5), with all species except C. fragile predicted to experience a northward shift in their southern (warm) edge of <= 406 km by the year 2100. Northward expansions outweighed southern extirpations for fucoids and C. crispus leading to overall range expansions, while range contractions were projected for kelps and C. fragile. Model projections generally agreed with physiological thresholds but were more conservative suggesting that range shifts for kelps may be underpredicted. Main conclusions Our results highlight the benefits to be gained from strong climate change mitigation (RCP2.6), which would limit changes in rocky shore community distribution and composition. The business-as-usual RCP8.5 scenario projected major range shifts, seaweed community reorganization and transitions in dominant species south of Newfoundland by 2100 (similar to 47 degrees N).

To elucidate the dynamics of catagenetic processes that occurred in the Silurian sediments against the background of an oil and gas systems formation. Method. The method includes lithology-facies, mineralogical-petrographic, catagenetic, and litho-fluido-dynamic analyses. Results. The spatial-temporal development features of carbonate (bank-reefal facies), argillite (outer and inner shelf), and argillite-carbonate (transition facies) complexes located in the Silurian sediments (profile of boreholes: Lishchynska-1 - Peremyshlyany-1 - Baluchin-1 - Olesko-1) have been determined. The main post-sedimentary transformations of clayey compound rocks consistent in the formation of quartz, calcite, pyrite, as well in the formation of caverns and fractures, which in most cases are combined with thin channels forming a single system, have been studied. It has been established that during the Palaeozoic and Early Mesozoic, the regime of catagenesis of the Silurian sediments of the considered structures was identical. Its further differentiation caused by the individualization of various tectonic block development occurred. In the first catagenetic cycle, the Silurian deposits reached the temperature conditions of the main zone of gas formation. The hydrocarbon (HC) generation centre was located in the western part of the studied profile (the Lishynskaya area), and within the zone of hydrocarbon accumulation a number of lithogenetic reservoirs were localized, the formation of which took place at different catagenetic substages. The main phase of hydrocarbon accumulation is confined to the Late Cretaceous. At this time in the Lishchino-Peremyshlyanskaya area there was a knot of reservoirs pertaining to the heterogeneous morphology, genesis, and the time of their formation. The spatial superposition of these reservoirs and the presence of a multi-directional system of fractures led to the formation of a single fluid system. In the Palaeogene, the accumulated oil and gas accumulations were destroyed as a result of the regional fracture zone development. Hydrocarbon fluids migrated both laterally and vertically with their possible accumulation in structural or lithological traps in the Silurian and Devonian sediments. Scientific novelty. The novel periodization of the Silurian deposits catagenesis has been determined, and the difference in the regime of catagenesis which occurred in various tectonic structures has been established. Practical relevance. The hydrocarbon fluids migration stages and the history of conditions during the formation of the lithogenetic reservoirs have been determined, which allowed assessing specific aspects of the oil-and-gas potential of the Silurian and adjacent sedimentary complexes.",,,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,,,1992-142X,2519-2663,,,,,,,,,,"NAS Ukraine, Inst Geol & Geochem Combustible Minerals, Naukova Str 3-A, UA-79060 Lvov, Ukraine",,,,2019-02-13,WOS:000457255900004,,

Super basins are characterized by two or more source rocks, stacked reservoirs, mature infrastructure, established service sectors, large amounts of data, and access to markets. Super basins commonly have multiple operators that form a community whose competitive atmosphere helps drive efficiency and performance. In an effort to identify sources for future oil and gas supplies, studies of the geology, hydrocarbon richness, and above-ground factors for 400 global basins led to the super basin concept. Super basins have continuous organic-rich mud rocks and other tight reservoirs that heretofore were not considered commercial targets. Based on analogy with proven resource plays in North American super basins, it is now possible to unlock substantial hydrocarbon potential in these tight rocks by employing horizontal drilling and multistage fracturing technologies.Super basins exist both onshore and offshore. The largest super basins are onshore, dominantly in forelands and passive margins, and have both conventional and tight rock potential. This paper focuses on the top 25 onshore super basins that are estimated to have 859 billion BOE of incremental technically recoverable resources. Offshore basins do not have the massive tight rock potential as onshore basins because of higher infrastructure costs. The archetype for the onshore super basin is the Permian Basin (west Texas) with 37 billion BOE produced and 60 billion bbl of oil and 300 TCF gas remaining.With huge resources, super basins can serve as supply disrupters and act as a regulator for the global price of crude oil and natural gas. Super basin concepts have caused geoscientists to think differently about petroleum basins. Super basins should be viewed as ecosystems that have below- and above-ground questions and technology and market considerations that must be resolved to assure commercial success.",,,,,,,,,17,5,0,0,0,0,21,,,0149-1423,1558-9153,,,,,,,,,,"IHS Markit, Houston, TX 77077 USA",IHS Markit,,,2021-05-15,WOS:000635378500003,,

The number of hydrocarbon leaks on offshore production installations on the Norwegian Continental Shelf peaked just after year 2000, with more than 40 leaks per year with initial rate above 0.1 kg/s. The Norwegian Oil and Gas Association ran a reduction project from 2003 until 2007, which resulted in ten hydrocarbon leaks above 0.1 kg/s in 2007. The number of leaks increased in the years after 2007, and was in average 15 in the period 2008-2010, without any significant increase in the number of installations. The Norwegian Oil and Gas Association initiated a new initiative early in 2011 in order to reduce the number of hydrocarbon leaks further. The initiative will be completed at the end of 2013, but has already started to show promising results. A study performed by the project concludes that more than 50% of the leaks are associated with failure of operational barriers during manual intervention into the process systems. Human and organizational factors are dominating with respect to circumstances and root causes. The study has further demonstrated the high importance of verification as an operational barrier, and has shown that many of the failures do not have multiple operational barriers at the end.

This event coincided with the spawning season of the Eastern oyster, Crassostrea virginica. Although oil bound to sediments constitutes an important source of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) exposure to benthic organisms, toxicity of sediment-associated DWH oil has not been investigated in any bivalve species. Here, we evaluated the sublethal effects of acute exposure of gametes, embryos and veliger larvae of the Eastern oyster to different concentrations of unfiltered elutriates of sediment contaminated with DWH oil. Our results suggest that gametes, embryos and veliger larvae are harmed by exposure to unfiltered elutriates of contaminated sediment. Effective concentrations for fertilization inhibition were 40.6 mu g tPAH50 L-1 and 173.2 mu g tPAH50 L-1 for EC20(1h) and EC50(1h) values, respectively. Embryo exposure resulted in dose-dependent abnormalities (EC20 and EC50 values were 77.7 mu g tPAH50 L-1 and 151 mu g tPAH50 L-1, respectively) and reduction in shell growth (EC20(24h) value of 1180 mu g tPAH50 L-1). Development and growth of veliger larvae were less sensitive to sediment-associated PAHs compared to embryos. Fertilization success and abnormality of larvae exposed as embryos were the most sensitive endpoints for assessing the toxicity of oil-contaminated sediment. Bulk of measured polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons were sediment-bound and caused toxic effects at lower tPAH50 concentrations than high energy water accommodated fractions (HEWAF) preparations from the same DWH oil. This study suggests risk assessments would benefit from further study of suspended contaminated sediment. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

Specifically, male employees heavily underscored the aspect of training and development whereas female employees placed their emphasis on leadership, thus showing different satisfiers within their jobs in the challenging oil and gas sector. Moreover, those employees in higher-income groups were seen to value certain aspects of leadership more than those in lower-income groups.

Carbon capture and reliable storage (CCS) is one path towards controlling emissions, and serves as a key component to climate change mitigation and will serve as a bridge between the fossil fuel energy of today and the renewable energy of the future. Although fossil-fueled power plants emit the vast majority of stationary CO2, there are many industries that emit purer streams of CO2, which result in reduced cost for separation. Moreover, many industries outside of electricity generation do not have ready alternatives for becoming low-carbon and CCS may be their only option. The thermodynamic minimum work for separation was calculated for a variety of CO2 emissions streams from various industries, followed by a Sherwood analysis of capture cost. The Sherwood plot correlates the relationship between concentrations of a target substance with the cost to separate it from the remaining components. As the target concentration increases, the cost to separate decreases on a molar basis. Furthermore, the lowest cost opportunities for deploying first-of-a-kind CCS technology were found to be in the Midwest and along the Gulf Coast. Many high purity industries, such as ethanol production, ammonia production and natural gas processing, are located in these regions. The southern Midwest and Gulf Coast are also co-located with potential geologic sequestration sites and enhanced oil recovery opportunities. As a starting point, these sites may provide the demonstration and knowledge necessary for reducing carbon capture technology costs across all industries, and improving the economic viability for CCS and climate change mitigation. The various industries considered in this review were examined from a dilution and impact perspective to determine the best path forward in terms of prioritizing for carbon capture. A possible implementation pathway is presented that initially focuses on CO2 capture from ethanol production, followed by the cement industry, ammonia, and then natural gas processing and ethylene oxide production. While natural gas processing and ethylene oxide production produce high purity streams, they only account for relatively small portions of industrial process CO2. Finally, petroleum refineries account for almost a fifth of industrial process CO2, but are comprised of numerous low-purity CO2 streams. These qualities make these three industries less attractive for initial CC implementation, and better suited for consideration towards the end of the industrial CC pathway. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

The Nigerian Federal Government has in the last few years demarcated the inland basins, of which little is known palynologically, for oil and gas exploration activities. An input from Nigeria concerning events of the Cretaceous-Paleogene boundary would broaden our knowledge of the global event.

The present study describes biotransformation of 2,4-DNT and 2,6-DNT in marine sediment sampled from a shipwreck site near Halifax Harbour. Incubation of either 2,4-DNT or 2,6-DNT in anaerobic sediment slurries (10% w/v) at 10 C led to the reduction of both DNTs to their corresponding diaminotoluene (2,4-DAT and 2,6-DAT) via the intermediary formation of their monoamine derivatives (ANTs). The production of diaminotoluene was enhanced in the presence of lactate for both DNT isomers. Using [C-14]-2,4-DNT less than 1% mineralization was observed as determined by liberated (CO2)-C-14. Sorption of DNTs, ANTS, and DATs was thus investigated to learn of their fate in marine sediments. Under anaerobic conditions, sorption followed the order: DNTs (K-d = 8.3-11.71 kg(-1)) > ANTs (K-d = 4.5-7.01 kg(-1)) > DATs (K-d = 3.8-4.5 1 kg(-1)). Incubation of 2,4-DAT in aerobic sediment led to rapid disappearance from the aqueous phase. LC/MS analysis of the aqueous phase and the acetone sediment extract showed the formation of azo- and hydrazo-dimers and trimers, as well as unidentified polymers. Experiments with radiolabelled 2,4-DAT showed a mass balance distributed as follows: 22% in the aqueous phase, 24% in acetone extracts, and 50% irreversibly bound to sediment. We concluded that DNT in anoxic marine sediment can undergo in situ natural attenuation by reduction to DAT followed by oxidative coupling to hydrazo-oligomers or irreversible binding to sediment.

However, biodiversity could be disadvantaged if not properly accounted for, particularly under climate change, where high carbon gains do not coincide spatially with biodiversity priorities. While globally there is congruence for species richness and carbon stocks, adequate conservation needs to incorporate more refined measures of biodiversity - and consideration of the impact of future climate change. We investigated the spatial trade-off for carbon and biodiversity priorities in north-eastern Australia based on current and projected climate, using the Zonation prioritisation software. By iteratively weighting carbon against biodiversity we found that prioritising laird based on biodiversity value (for 697 vertebrates) included priority areas for potential carbon sequestration (Maximum Potential Biomass). However, if prioritisation was based on carbon sequestration potential alone, substantial areas important for biodiversity would be lost. Policy frameworks need to be strengthened to remove barriers from landholder participation in carbon storage projects that have biodiversity benefits, and to require that both carbon and biodiversity gains are additional. Properly accounting for biodiversity in land-based carbon sequestration and storage prioritisation in this region is likely to generate substantial benefits for both biodiversity and carbon.

We developed a Bayesian network model to evaluate the relative influence of environmental and anthropogenic stressors, and their mitigation, on the persistence of polar bears (Ursus maritimus). Overall sea ice conditions, affected by rising global temperatures, were the most influential determinant of population outcomes. Accordingly, unabated rise in atmospheric greenhouse gas (GHG) concentrations was the dominant influence leading to worsened population outcomes, with polar bears in three of four ecoregions reaching a dominant probability of decreased or greatly decreased by the latter part of this century. Stabilization of atmospheric GHG concentrations by mid-century delayed the greatly reduced state by approximate to 25 yr in two ecoregions. Prompt and aggressive mitigation of emissions reduced the probability of any regional population becoming greatly reduced by up to 25%. Marine prey availability, linked closely to sea ice trend, had slightly less influence on outcome state than sea ice availability itself. Reduced mortality from hunting and defense of life and property interactions resulted in modest declines in the probability of a decreased or greatly decreased population outcome. Minimizing other stressors such as trans-Arctic shipping, oil and gas exploration, and contaminants had a negligible effect on polar bear outcomes, although the model was not well-informed with respect to the potential influence of these stressors. Adverse consequences of loss of sea ice habitat became more pronounced as the summer ice-free period lengthened beyond four months, which could occur in most of the Arctic basin after mid-century if GHG emissions are not promptly reduced. Long-term conservation of polar bears would be best supported by holding global mean temperature to <= 2 degrees C above preindustrial levels. Until further sea ice loss is stopped, management of other stressors may serve to slow the transition of populations to progressively worsened outcomes, and improve the prospects for their long-term persistence.",,,,,,,,,42,0,0,0,39,0,47,,,2150-8925,,,,,,,,,,,"US Geol Survey, Alaska Sci Ctr, Anchorage, AK 99508 USAUS Forest Serv, Pacific Northwest Res Stn, USDA, Portland, OR 97208 USAUS Geol Survey, Alaska Sci Ctr, Juneau, AK 99801 USAPolar Bears Int, Bozeman, MT 59772 USA",Polar Bears Int,,,2016-06-01,WOS:000382158500001,,

However, separating the combined effects of oil pollution, environmental variables and methodological aspects of beach monitoring on seabird stranding patterns is a challenging task. The effects of a comprehensive set of oceanographic and climatic variables and oil pollution on seabird strandings in a tropical area of Brazil were investigated herein, using two robust and innovative methods: Generalized Linear Mixed Models and Structural Equation Modeling. We assessed strandings of four resident seabird species along 480 km of beaches divided into 11 sampling areas, between November 2010 and September 2013. We found that increasing the distance from the nearest breeding island reduce the seabird stranding events. Storm activity and biological productivity were the most important factors affecting the stranding events of brown boobies Sula leucogaster, Cabot's terns Thalasseus acuflavidus and kelp gulls Larus dominicanus. These species are also indirectly affected by warm tropical waters, which reduce chlorophyll-a concentrations. Beach surveys are, thus, useful to investigate the mortality rates of resident species near breeding sites, where individuals are more abundant and exposed to local factors associated with at-sea mortality. In contrast, conservation actions and monitoring programs for far-ranging seabird species are needed in more distant foraging areas. Furthermore, beach monitoring programs investigating the impact of oil pollution on seabirds need to account for the effects of environmental factors on stranding patterns. The present study also demonstrated that seabirds inhabiting tropical coastal waters are sensitive to climate conditions such as adverse weather, which are expected to increase in frequency and intensity in next decades.",,,,,,,,,27,0,0,0,26,0,28,,,1932-6203,,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Estadual Norte Fluminense, Lab Ciencias Ambientais, Campos Dos Goytacazes, RJ, BrazilLeibniz Ctr Trop Marine Ecol, Syst Ecol Grp, Bremen, GermanyFiocruz MS, Inst Oswaldo Cruz, Rio De Janeiro, RJ, Brazil",,,,2017-03-01,WOS:000392758000075,27992578,

While studies have researched the role of rivers in transporting and cycling nutrients, relatively little research has been conducted on the role large river floodplains play in reducing downstream conveyance of these aquatic contaminants. Recent studies have shown floodplains can store significant quantities of nitrogen, phosphorus and carbon during individual floods or years, but few have looked at the effectiveness of aggrading floodplains to retain these nutrients over decadal to century timescales. Through sediment coring of multiple areas of the Mississippi River floodplain between La Crosse and Cassville, Wisconsin and through high temporal resolution sediment analyses this study will 1) quantify how sedimentation and nutrient concentrations associated with sediments have changed on the Mississippi River floodplain from pre-European-American settlement to present; 2) characterize how hydrologic connectivity and geomorphology of the Mississippi River floodplain affect nutrient retention and fluxes; and 3) identify the dominant forms of phosphorus retained on the floodplain. Magnetic susceptibility and grain size characteristics will be used in conjunction with phosphorus, nitrogen and carbon analyses to address the research objectives. Depositional chronology will be established using a combination of accelerator mass spectrometry radiocarbon dating, cesium radionuclide activity, and ambrosia pollen associated with European-American settlement. It is expected that the floodplain of the Mississippi River retains significant quantities of sediment and nitrogen, phosphorus, and carbon unaccounted for in existing nutrient budgets that would otherwise be flushed downstream. This research is a necessary step toward determining the significance of floodplain environments in sequestering nutrients over timescales ranging from singular floods to century scale. Nitrogen and phosphorus contribute to large algal blooms in rivers, lakes and marine ecosystems that can lead to a reduction in water quality and degradation of aquatic habitat. Through a greater understanding of how floodplains retain sediment and nutrients and through improved knowledge of where they are retained spatially on the floodplain, resource managers will be able to manage these areas more effectively to reduce downstream nutrient transport and its adverse impacts. Knowledge concerning how floodplain nutrient storage is affected by drainage basin land use and increased flooding is needed, especially as increased corn production for ethanol will likely lead to increased nutrient and sediment transport by rivers. As climate researchers continue to search for ways to reduce atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations, the expected results of this research which documents how carbon storage in river sediment varies with floodplain hydrology will be important.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,802657,,,,,,,,University of Wisconsin-Madison,,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:13650248,,

However, the uncertainty of wind measurements from a moving LiDAR are not clear, particularly due to the wave- and current-induced motion of the buoy. Therefore a numerical model with state-of-the-art approaches in conventional oil and gas industry was developed to quantify uncertainty and understand the effect of environmental conditions on the buoy. The model was validated against data from a measurement campaign at the offshore research platform FINO 3. The results show the challenges and limitations when transferring the experience from the oil and gas industry directly because of the different geometries and the much smaller buoys used for FLS.

Scientists, researchers, expert organizations, and policymakers suggest that in order to combat the instabilities caused by global warming, further investigation in the direction of safe CO2 storage should be at utmost priority. To reduce GHG concentration in atmosphere, carbon capture and storage (CCS) has emerged as a promising bridge technology, by capturing CO2 from the major sources such as cement factories, fossil fuel-based production plants, etc. and subsequently storing it in subsurface. CCS technology greatly reduces CO2 concentration and restricts and protects subsequent migration by safely storing within geologic formations for millions of years. The CO2 is injected into suitable geological formations at depths below 800 m or more, and various trapping mechanisms would prevent further migration of the stored CO2 to the surface. Potential candidates for safe storage of CO2 are geological storage (in geological formations, such as un-mineable coal seams, depleted oil and gas fields, and deep saline formations), ocean storage (direct release into ocean), and industrial fixation into inorganic carbonates. This chapter provides a detailed knowledge on the sources of GHG emissions into the atmosphere and the status of CCS process worldwide emphasizing on the various trapping mechanisms of CO2 in geological formations. The storage of CO2 in geological formations is greatly affected by environmental factors, so impact of these variables is described.

An understanding of how the composition and concentration of the oil are altered by weathering, including chemical, physical and biological processes, is needed to evaluate the oil toxicity and impact on the ecosystem in the northern Gulf of Mexico. This study examined petroleum hydrocarbons in oil mousse collected from the sea surface and salt marshes, and in oil deposited in sediments adjacent to the wellhead after the DWH oil spill. Oil mousses were collected at two stations (OSS and CT, located 130 and 85 km away from the wellhead, respectively) in May 2010, and two sediment samples from stations SG and SC, within 6 km of the wellhead, in May 2011. We also collected oil mousse from salt marshes at Marsh Point (MP), Mississippi, 186 km away from the wellhead in July 2010. In these samples, n-alkanes, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), alkylated PAHs, BTEX (collective name of benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene and p-, m-, and o-xylenes), C3-benzenes and trace metals were measured to examine how the oil was altered chemically. The chemical analysis indicates that the oil mousses underwent different degrees of weathering with the pattern of OSS < CT < MP. This pattern is consistent with the projected oil mousse movement from the accident site to salt marshes. Also, the contents of trace metals Al, V, Cr, Fe, Mn, Ni, Co, Cu, As and Pb in the oil mousse generally increased along the way to the salt marshes, indicating that these trace metals were perhaps aggregated into the oil mousse during the transport. Petroleum hydrocarbon data reveal that the oil deposited in sediments underwent only light to moderate degradation one year after the DWH oil spill, as supported by the presence of short-chained n-alkanes (C10-C15), BTEX and C3-benzenes. The weathering of oil in sediment may result from biological degradation and dissolution, evidenced by the preferential loss of mid-chained n- alkanes C16-C27, lower ratios of n-C-17/Pr and n-C-18/Ph, and preferential loss of PAHs relative to alkylated PAHs.",,,,,,,,,188,5,0,0,146,1,222,,,1748-9326,,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Texas Austin, Inst Marine Sci, Port Aransas, TX 78373 USASUNY Stony Brook, Sch Marine & Atmospher Sci, Stony Brook, NY 11794 USAUniv So Mississippi, Dept Coastal Sci, Gulf Coast Res Lab, Ocean Springs, MS 39564 USA",,,,2012-07-01,WOS:000309555300040,,

On the broader scale, total petroleum system (TPS, where geology has no boundaries) can virtually be envisaged as a digital petroleum ecosystem. The significance of this concept lies in connecting onshore and offshore petroleum subsystems, in a basin (e.g., Indonesian Onshore-Offshore basin, a 19,300 mi(2) [ 50,000 -km(2)] transition zone), through elements and process attributes and by modeling sub-basins thru contextualization and specification concepts.In this paper, we present an ontology based data warehousing and mining technology in which, conceptualization and contextualization of multiple data dimensions are modeled within a sedimentary basin (e. g., elements and processes of all petroleum systems, existing within basin). In addition to their integration within a data warehouse environment, data mining and visualization of interpretable data views that emerge from petroleum digital ecosystems are made feasible. Multidimensional data warehousing and mining models facilitate an effective interpretation of petroleum ecosystems, minimizing the ambiguities involved during knowledge mapping of geological structure and reservoir qualities - not only for exploration and field development planning, but also for reserve estimations.",,,,,11th IEEE International Conference on Industrial Informatics (INDIN)11th IEEE International Conference on Industrial Informatics (INDIN),"JUL 29-31, 2013JUL 29-31, 2013","Ruhr Univ Bochum, Fac Elect Engn & Informat Technol; Inst Elect & Elect Engineers; IEEE Ind Elect Soc; New Univ Lisbon, Fac Sci & Technol, Dep Elect EngnRuhr Univ Bochum, Fac Elect Engn & Informat Technol; Inst Elect & Elect Engineers; IEEE Ind Elect Soc; New Univ Lisbon, Fac Sci & Technol, Dep Elect Engn","Bochum, GERMANYBochum, GERMANY",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,1935-4576,,978-1-4799-0752-6,,,,,,,,,"Schlumberger, PTS, Moscow, RussiaCurtin Univ Technol, Perth, WA 6845, AustraliaMEDCO Energy, Jakarta, Indonesia",MEDCO Energy,,,2014-06-04,WOS:000335552900080,,

With current sea-level-rise projections, coupled with the state's eroding barrier islands and coastal wetlands, the region's estuarine environments are in jeopardy of being lost, redefined, or permanently altered. As the coast erodes, Louisiana is endangered of losing valuable wetland's habitat. In addition, if the barrier islands disappear, the region's wetland-oriented oil and gas wells and associated infrastructure will be at risk to open Gulf conditions. If this should occur, each well, pipeline, and storage battery represents a potential environmental catastrophe. From an oil-spill-response perspective, it is much easier to clean a barrier beach than a saltwater or freshwater marsh. The barrier islands represent not only the first line of defense against the combined wind and water forces of a hurricane, but they also serve as pipeline anchor points. More importantly, the islands protect the marshes from an offshore-derived oil spill. Tidal mud flats, shallow grass beds, marshes and swamps are especially difficult to clean. The key, therefore, to an effective oil-spill-response plan is related directly to the viability of these islands, along with detailed pre-existing environmental, ecological, and habitat information. To be useful, this knowledge must be extensive, current, and easily extracted from a comprehensive data base. These data are being developed in Louisiana in the form of an all-inclusive geographic information system (GIS). Data in this system are helping Louisiana manage a vast array of resources. From a historical perspective, analysis of these data can serve as a model on how a deltaic environment can change from hydrocarbon exploration and development. Entering into the 21st century, Louisiana's comprehensive database can help balance oil and gas activity, while maintaining the viability of the state's estuarine environments.",,,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,1,0,2,,,1006-9291,,,,,,,,,,,"Louisiana State Univ, Energy Programs, Baton Rouge, LA 70803 USA",,,,2001-08-01,WOS:000171498900029,,
J,,,,,,,,,"Rudko,Sergey",,Geological evolution of the Patom paleobasin: global and local factors of rock formation and formation of the Vendian-Cambrian hydrocarbon system in southern Eastern Siberia.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Awarded Grant,Jul 01 2020,2020,"In the southern Yakutia the largest oil and gas bearing areas of Eastern Siberia (Nepa-Botuoba anteclise, Predpatom regional Trough) are located. The development of oil and gas region began in the middle of XX century, but is fully unfolding now. The completion of the Eastern Siberia - Pacific Ocean oil pipeline and the «Power of Siberia» gas pipeline (commissioned in 2019) removes restrictions on increasing oil and gas production in Yakutia. Thus, a large amount of geological exploration work is planned to assess the resource potential and expand the production of hydrocarbons in the PredPatom Regional Trough (the Strategy for the Development of the Geological Industry until 2030 approved by the Russian government). The efficiency of such works critically depends on the correctness and validity of geological data. The Late Cambrian-Early Paleozoic rocks of the Predpatom Regional Trough were formed in the platform part of the Patom paleobasin in the south of the Siberian platform. At the stage of the beginning of the development of oil and gas bearing regions of Yakutia, there were ideas about the Riphean age of potentially oil-source sediments of the Patom Paleobasin and the presence of a significant stratigraphic break in the bottom of the productive Vend-Cambrian layers, which is associated with tectonic events of the Baikal fold [Bobrov, 1964]. Modern developments in the field of Precambrian sediment stratigraphy show that the entire section of the sedimentary system, which encloses the oil and gas bearing system of the south Siberian [Shemin, 2017], should be rejuvenated to the Vendian [Sergeev et al., 2011; Chumakov et al., 2013], and possibly to the Late Vendian (580 million years) [Rudko et al., 2017]. At the same time, there are reasons to believe that the Vendian-Cambrian deposits of the Patom paleobasin were formed during accretionary tectonic events [Powerman et al., 2015; Chumakov et al., 2016]. In addition to the local tectonic factor, the global changes in the environment and the biosphere that took place on Earth in the Late Precambrian Early Cambrian determined the specifics of sediments of this age in southern Siberia. In the section of the Patom paleobasin we can see a change in the prevalence of anoxic settings of marine sedimentation of the Balagannah and Dalnyaya Taiaga Group (which contributed to the formation and determined the properties of oil-source rocks), to the oxigenic marine environment and the formation of a large carbonate platform of the Zhuya and Trehversta Groups (which caused the formation of rocks of hydrocarbon reservoirs). This was followed by the formation of evaporitic warm water sediments of epicontinental seas and thus formed a regional-scale fluid resistance. The aim of this Project is to make a step towards a more justified reconstruction of the geological evolution of the Patom Paleobasin, which was determined by global environmental perturbations (climate, ocean geochemistry) and biosphere, as well as by the changing tectonic regime in the south of the Siberian Platform in the Late Preсambrian - Early Paleozoic. This project continues the research carried out by its leader in 2018-2019 within the framework of RNF Project No. 18-77-00059 in extended form. Expanded research involves an increase in the stratigraphic volume and area of research, as well as a variety of methods involved. The key research objects will be the Urа Uplift, Chara and Tokko sections of the northeastern periphery of the Baikal-Patom folding region and the Predpatom regional trough. The selection of tasks and methods involved is based on the gap analysis in understanding the current evolution of the Patom Paleobasin. The first main task is to clarify time intervals for the formation of sedimentary series in the Patom paleobasin. This will involve U-Pb dating of zircons, Pb-Pb and Re-Os isochronous dating of carbonate rocks, and the cyclostratigraphic method. The second main task is to reconstruct the formation and primary characteristics of sediments in the Patom Paleobasin, including organic matter content, redox conditions, C, O, Sr, S isotopes, chemical composition of sediments, sources of sediments, etc. Thus, it is planned to clarify the paleoclimate, paleogeographical and paleotectonic conditions, to reconstruct facies and transgressive-regressive cycles of sediment formation in the Vendian-Cambrian period in the south of the Siberian Platform. The project will result in the clarification of the Patom bassin paleotectonic evolution, which will create prerequisites for a general revision of the geological development of oil and gas bearing areas in the south of the Siberian platform. This will make it possible to carry out a more reasonable computer modeling of the evolution of oil and gas bearing systems (basin modeling) of the PredPatom Regional Trough and the Nepsko-Botuobinskaya anteclise and will increase the efficiency of geological exploration work in search and evaluation of hydrocarbon reserves in southern Siberia.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,20-77-10066,,,,,,,,RAS Geological Institute,RAS Geological Institute,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:15291999,,

Over the last six years the SuperGen MARINE programme has been supporting the development of this emerging industrial sector by working on a range problems from the characterisation of the raw resource through to energy conversion technologies to delivery into the distribution grid together with work on the environmental consequences and the potential economic impact of large scale industry. The importance of the industry is recognised by the Department for Energy and Climate Change and the Scottish Government if the UK is to meet it's 2020 and 2050 objectives for renewable energy generation. The last decade, which opened with the installation of the LIMPET wave energy power station on Islay, has seen a considerable advance in tidal and wave energy crowned by the deployment of the SeaGen turbine in Strangford Narrows, the deployment of the world's first array of wave energy converters off the Portuguese coast, and the deployment of the OYSTER wave energy converter at the EMEC test site. UK technology developers have led all these projects. To achieve our ambitious deployment goals building capacity within the sector is critical, while SuperGen MARINE is currently training the next generation of researchers and technology developers this project seeks to enthuse future scientists and engineers to work in the sector and to enable today's young people to understand the issues and contribute to the debate on our future energy generation portfolio.It is critical that the general public, and in particular our future scientists and engineers understand the significant challenges in exploiting the oceans energy resources. Ocean energy has the capacity to provide an important component of a balanced energy portfolio for the UK, but this can only be achieved with* Informed and balanced debate on the benefits and consequences of large-scale deployment.* A dramatic increase in the number of skilled people employed in the sector.These two points are exemplified by; the time taken for, and controversy generated by, the consenting of the Beauly-Denny transmission network upgrade, and the fact that providing 2GW of marine energy generating capacity by 2020 will require manufacturing, installing and commissioning, two marine energy converters each week for the next ten years!Recent announcements of a huge expansion of offshore wind will see a sizeable increase in publicity, focus, training, jobs and opportunities in offshore wind construction, maintenance, planning and design. If marine isn't to be left behind in the rush for offshore wind, we must stimulate interest and capture the interest of young people making career choices now.This project is producing two short, 10 minute, mini-documentaries on wave and tidal energy (aimed at O/A-level and Standard/Higher-grade students) to complement the two mini-documentaries (aimed at the general public) being produced by the European EquiMar project. Once completed the films will be published on a dedicated You-Tube channel, made available on DVD to secondary schools and publicised through the project, SuperGen MARINE and EquiMar websites. They will also be dispersed via Scotland's Glow, a digital intranet for secondary schools, and via Lifelong Learning UK and Careers UK networks to schools in England and Wales. At the end of the project we will organise a public screening of the four films (in Edinburgh) followed by a panel debate ( Marine Energy Question Time ) with a panel drawn from scientists, engineers and developers participating in SuperGen and EquiMar.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,EP/I001239/1,,,,,,,,University of Edinburgh,,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:15346575,,

This methodology has been applied to post-maintenance tasks of offshore oil and gas facility pumps to investigate how management, operational, and equipment issues must be considered in risk analysis and prediction of human error in cold environments.Results: This paper provides a proof of concept indicating that the risk associated with operations in cold environments is greater than the risk associated with the same operations performed in temperate climates. It also develops guidelines regarding how this risk can be assessed. The results illustrate that in post-maintenance procedures of a pump, the risk value related to the effect of cold and harsh environments on operator cognitive performance is twice as high as the risk value when performed in normal conditions.Conclusion: The present work demonstrates significant differences between human error probabilities (HEPs) and associated risks in normal conditions as opposed to cold and harsh environments. This study also highlights that the cognitive performance of the human operator is the most important factor affected by the cold and harsh conditions.Application: The methodology developed in this paper can be used for reevaluating the HEPs for particular scenarios that occur in harsh environments since these HEPs may not be comparable to similar scenarios in normal conditions.",,,,,,,,,41,0,0,0,1,0,42,,,0018-7208,1547-8181,,,,,,,,,,"Mem Univ Newfoundland, St John, NF A1B 3X5, CanadaPrinceton Univ, Princeton, NJ 08544 USAMem Univ Newfoundland, Sch Human Kinet, St John, NF A1B 3X5, Canada",,,,2014-09-17,WOS:000340724100003,25141591,

Sometime between 1839 and 1858, a hurricane isolated its lagoon from the ocean, and the lagoon became a brackish ecosystem. In spite of its geographic isolation, human activities have deeply altered this insular ecosystem since the 1890s. Among disruptions induced by humans were introductions of alien species. This work aims to synthesize the knowledge of breeding birds and introduced mammals collected between 1825, the year of the first documented human landing, and 2005. This synthesis helps to understand the evolution of the populations of these communities. Among autochthonous species are seabirds. Among these, Masked and Brown Booby, currently constitute a huge mixed breeding colony. Humans introduced two mammals inadvertently. These are the Feral Pig which was introduced in 1897 and eradicated in 1958, and the Black Rat which was probably introduced in 1998 or 1999. Shipwrecks are the probable cause of the arrival of these species. Impacts on this ecosystem caused by introduction and eradication of Feral Pig are discussed. Potential impacts of Black Rat are also discussed. The prompt eradication of rats appears to be the most important action that must be taken to prevent irreversible consequences to this unique ecosystem.

This work is novel and scientifically important because it provides a hydrodynamic framework for linking two parts of the river continuum, fluvial and estuarine channels, which heretofore had been treated separately. We will measure channel dimensions, sediment properties, velocity profiles, and turbulent stresses in river flows, and model the changes in energy as tides advance upstream. In the section of the river where flows transition from solely downstream flow to becoming influenced by tides, we hypothesize that tidal energy dissipation processes lead to enhanced riverbed erosion, giving rise to a characteristic river form. Findings from this study will help shed light on: 1) how to manage dam water releases to minimize erosion downstream, 2) the development and stability of river bed habitats, and 3) sediment discharge to the coastal zone.

The HST was designed for a minimum fifteen-year mission with on-orbit servicing by the Space Shuttle System planned at approximately three-year intervals.Major changes to the HST ground system have been implemented for the third servicing mission in December 1999. The primary objectives of the ground system reengineering effort, a project called Vision 2000 Control Center System (CCS), are to reduce both development and operating costs significantly for the remaining years of HST's lifetime. Development costs are reduced by providing a more modern hardware and software architecture and utilizing commercial off the shelf(COTS) products wherever possible.Part of CCS is a Space Telescope Engineering Data Store, the design of which is based on current Data Warehouse technology. The Data Warehouse (Red Brick), as implemented in the CCS Ground System that operates and monitors the Hubble Space Telescope, represents the first use of a commercial Data Warehouse to manage engineering data. The purpose of this data store is to provide a common data source of telemetry data for an HST subsystems. This data store will become the engineering data archive and will provide a queryable database for the user to analyze HST telemetry. The access to the engineering data in the Data Warehouse is platform-independent from an office environment using commercial standards (Unix, Windows98/NT). The latest Internet technology is used to reach the HST engineering community. A WEB-based user interface allows easy access to the data archives.This paper will provide a CCS system overview and will illustrate some of the CCS telemetry capabilities: in particular the use of the new Telemetry Archiving System.Vision 2000(1) is an ambitious project, but one that is well under way.

This work investigates supersonic separator as a strategy for affording post-combustion capture backed up by cost reductions. Conventional offshore gas processing usually loses thermodynamic hydrate inhibitor methanol in processing and exported gas. This work analyses a supersonic separator variant gas processing simultaneously reducing methanol losses. Such process dramatically improves gas-plant profitability via cost-reduction of methanol make-up and power-consumption, simultaneously increasing revenues from liquefied-petroleum-gas by-product. This economic leverage affords post-combustion carbon capture, including subsequent CO2 dehydration and compression for exportation of high-pressure liquid CO2. This corresponds to abate 43% of CO2 emissions boosting revenues via enhanced oil recovery. Moreover, CO2 is dehydrated via another supersonic separator operating with minimum head-loss, minimizing compression costs. Despite its much higher investment, the new process with carbon capture presents higher net value (865.63 MMUSD) than the conventional processing without carbon capture (829.31 MMUSD), being economically feasible and more environmentally adequate with cleaner natural gas production and successful CO2 management. The new process is superior in several scenarios and particularly favored by oil prices above 55 USD/bbl. Rising oil price from 40 to 100 USD/bbl, the new process net value rises 29%, whereas the conventional counterpart rises only 7.5%. In addition, as a plausible future scenario, CO2 taxation favors the new process, which always has superior economic performance, even without CO2 taxation. In summary, implementing supersonic separators in offshore natural gas processing aiming at anti-hydrate recovery and CO2 dehydration for enhanced oil recovery creates economic leverage sustaining Carbon Capture & Storage without loss of competitiveness. This result, backed up by rigorous thermodynamic simulations and economic-environmental assessments, configure an original achievement to the literature.",,,,,,,,,22,0,0,0,5,0,22,,,0301-4797,1095-8630,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Fed Rio de Janeiro, Escola Quim, Av Horacio Macedo 2030,BL E, BR-21949900 Rio De Janeiro, RJ, Brazil",,,,2019-03-28,WOS:000461410000053,30771673,

However, their environmental impact is significant. Consequently, some of these areas have started to use hybrid systems that combine renewable energy sources and fossil fuel generation, such as wind-diesel systems, although wind is not feasible in some remote locations and fossil fuels remain the only resource in these areas. Fortunately, offshore renewable energy sources are available in many remote areas close to the ocean. In order to understand the feasibility of using offshore renewables in remote oceanic areas, we recently conducted a systematic study by developing an integrated model. This model includes a supply module, demand module, environmental impact module, and integrating module. Using this model, we mainly study the reduction in emissions resulting from offshore renewable energy penetration in local energy systems. In this article, we present this integrated model, and an example study of tidal energy in the Southern Alaska community of Elfin Cove, which relies on diesel fuel for all of its electricity requirements. With 56 kW of tidal power penetrating the energy system, we found that almost 12,000 gallons of diesel fuel are displaced per year. This results in an annual emissions reduction of almost 244,000 lb CO2 and about 1400 lb CO, as well as considerable reductions of PM-10, NOx, and SOx. The newly developed integrated model is expected to be used to analyze other aspects of tidal energy (and offshore renewable energy in general) in remote areas. For example, since the electricity demand in some remote areas varies significantly throughout the year, we recommend that tidal power should be used with a storage system.

Examining effects of this oil spill will generate much-needed insight into how shoreline habitats and the valuable ecological services they provide (e. g., shoreline protection) are affected by and recover from large-scale disturbance. Here we report on not only rapid salt-marsh recovery (high resilience) but also permanent marsh area loss after the BP-Deepwater Horizon oil spill. Field observations, experimental manipulations, and wave-propagation modeling reveal that (i) oil coverage was primarily concentrated on the seaward edge of marshes; (ii) there were thresholds of oil coverage that were associated with severity of salt-marsh damage, with heavy oiling leading to plant mortality; (iii) oil-driven plant death on the edges of these marshes more than doubled rates of shoreline erosion, further driving marsh platform loss that is likely to be permanent; and (iv) after 18 mo, marsh grasses have largely recovered into previously oiled, noneroded areas, and the elevated shoreline retreat rates observed at oiled sites have decreased to levels at reference marsh sites. This paper highlights that heavy oil coverage on the shorelines of Louisiana marshes, already experiencing elevated retreat because of intense human activities, induced a geomorphic feedback that amplified this erosion and thereby set limits to the recovery of otherwise resilient vegetation. It thus warns of the enhanced vulnerability of already degraded marshes to heavy oil coverage and provides a clear example of how multiple human-induced stressors can interact to hasten ecosystem decline.",,,,,,,,,240,3,0,0,188,0,303,,,0027-8424,,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Florida, Dept Biol, Gainesville, FL 32611 USARoyal Netherlands Inst Sea Res NIOZ, Spatial Ecol Dept, NL-4401 NT Yerseke 7, NetherlandsUniv Groningen, CEES, Community & Conservat Ecol Grp, NL-9747 AG Groningen 7, NetherlandsUniv Florida, Dept Geol Sci, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA",,,,2012-07-10,WOS:000306642100046,22733752,

Annual and seasonal trends from fisheries and population data indicate that regional stocks of both species have collapsed in response to overfishing of spawning aggregations and changes in environmental conditions. The aggregating behavior of fish and persistent targeting of spawning aggregations by recreational fisheries combined to produce a hyperstable relationship between CPUE and stock abundance in both species, which created the illusion that population levels were stable and masked fishery collapses. Differences in the rate of decline between the two species may be related to the size, duration, and spatial distribution of their spawning aggregations.

J,,,Canadian Science Advisory Secretariat,,,,,,,,REVIEW OF MITIGATION AND MONITORING MEASURES FOR SEISMIC SURVEY ACTIVITIES IN AND NEAR THE HABITAT OF CETACEAN SPECIES AT RISK.,,,,,,,,Canadian Science Advisory Secretariat Science Advisory Report,,,,5,,,,1,33,,,,,,,,,,,Article; Meeting,2015,2015,"Oil and gas exploration and mapping activities in areas frequented by cetacean species listed under the Species at Risk Act (SARA) has led to a need to review the Statement of Canadian Practice with respect to the Mitigation of Seismic Sound in the Marine Environment (SOCP) and evaluate its effectiveness for avoiding SARA-prohibited impacts (killing, harm and harassment of individuals and destruction of critical habitat) on SARA-listed cetaceans. Building on previous advice, the potential effects on SARA-listed cetaceans of seismic airgun sounds produced during seismic surveys were examined to identify potential consequences and pathways of effects linked to killing, harm and harassment of individuals and destruction of critical habitat (using the most recent definitions of these terms available) (Table 1). Possible sound exposure metrics that could be used to determine quantitative thresholds for avoiding SARA-prohibited impacts were discussed (Table 2). Potential sound exposure metrics do exist for a number of potential effects such as auditory physiological effects, changes in vocalization patterns, hampered passive acoustic detection of prey, predators and conspecifics, and hampered avoidance of anthropogenic threats. In most cases; however, standardized descriptors of these metrics used by the wider scientific community do not exist. Single independent thresholds to avoid SARA-prohibited impacts could not be determined at this time as little information is available on quantitative linkages between sound exposure and response metrics for cetaceans. Permanent (PTS) and temporary hearing threshold shifts (TTS) could potentially be used to establish thresholds for avoiding physiological effects resulting in the killing, harm and harassment of individuals, but these would only in-part address SARA-prohibited impacts and additional thresholds would be needed for potential effects on behavior and ecology. Further research and analyses are required to relate sound exposure metrics to quantitative thresholds for the various physiological, behavioral and ecosystem effects caused by exposure to seismic surveys that could result in SARA-prohibited impacts. Given the uncertainties that remain around thresholds for avoiding SARA-prohibited impacts, implementation of precautionary and reliable risk-reducing mitigation measures is likely to be the most effective approach for minimizing potential negative impacts on SARA-listed cetaceans. Thus, despite the inability to recommend quantitative thresholds, the mitigation measures of the SOCP were reviewed in a precautionary manner in reference to reducing/avoiding SARA-prohibited impacts on SARA-listed cetaceans using the Scotian Shelf population of northern bottlenose whales, North Atlantic right whales and Atlantic blue whales as case studies. It was concluded that most of the mitigation measures of the SOCP likely reduce the potential negative impacts of seismic airgun sounds on individuals, but to varying degrees and with some caveats (Table 3). For example, effectiveness may be limited by the availability of information on distribution, abundance and behavior of a species, or by the specific manner in which the mitigation measure is conducted. Implementation of the multiple measures of the SOCP as a whole is likely to be more effective than any one measure on its own, and the SOCP provides flexibility for enhancing mitigation measures to meet SARA requirements as it states that operators may be required to put in place additional or modified mitigation measures for species of concern. The SOCP focuses on reducing significant adverse effects on individuals and populations mainly through efforts to reduce potential physical injury to animals in close proximity of airgun arrays, but does not provide specific mitigation measures for reducing impacts that may occur at greater ranges from the sound source (i.e., beyond the safety zone) or for reducing impacts on habitat. Planning seismic surveys to avoid significant adverse effects or to avoid displacing/diverting listed marine mammals are considered the only measures within the SOCP that address preventing the potential harm or harassment of individuals beyond the established safety zone or destruction of critical habitat. Planning seismic surveys to avoid spatial and temporal overlap with areas where SARA-listed cetaceans are anticipated to be present is considered the most effective mitigation measure to reduce impacts on individuals and their critical habitat, but is dependent upon adequate information on distribution and abundance. In many cases, research effort is needed prior to seismic survey activities to sufficiently determine species occurrence so that spatial and temporal avoidance measures can be effectively applied. Furthermore, avoidance of spatial and temporal overlap may not always be possible as seismic surveys are usually limited to a specific area of interest and year-round resident species cannot be avoided. The safety zone radius should be the most conservative of either 500 meters or a radius determined using propagation models based on the best available data and science for a pre-determined acoustic threshold (which has yet to be established), taking into account to the extent possible the species, environment and sound source context, and which should be validated with field measurements. To effectively monitor a safety zone for cetaceans, seismic survey activities and cetacean detection methods should be designed to maximize the likelihood of detecting SARA-listed cetaceans to achieve a target probability of detection within the safety zone consistent with SARA requirements (which has yet to be established). Enhanced real-time monitoring methods/technologies such as extended pre ramp-up observation periods, limiting seismic survey operations to good visibility conditions, having an adequate number of experienced and qualified Marine Mammal Observers (MMOs) searching, use of additional monitoring platforms, enhancing visual observations with passive acoustic monitoring (PAM) efforts and/or other monitoring technologies should be considered. A combination of detection methods/technologies may be required to achieve the target probability of detection. The effectiveness of ramp-up procedures or reduction of the airgun array to a single source element as a mitigation measure during seismic surveys is not fully understood, though some modeling and behavioral response studies are currently being conducted to investigate effectiveness. To comply with SARA by avoiding SARA-prohibited impacts, research efforts to increase our understanding of distribution and abundance over time, the behavioral and physiological responses of cetaceans to seismic airgun sounds, and the consequences of such responses on the habitat use, health, reproduction, survival and recovery of impacted species are required. This will be especially important in areas where seismic surveys overlap the distribution of SARA-listed cetaceans. Such studies have been and continue to be conducted by the international science community and are important for increasing our knowledge of the extent of the impacts of seismic surveys on cetaceans. To be most relevant for effective management, this research should be focused on risk or harm reduction rather than full knowledge of the basic biology behind impacts, which could take many years build a complete understanding of and thus delay useful mitigation measures. Explicitly designed research studies will be necessary to evaluate the efficacy of mitigation measures that have been implemented during seismic surveys for reducing the impacts of seismic airgun sounds on SARA-listed cetaceans. Such studies will need to be designed with rigorous data collection protocols and sufficient statistical power and sensitivity to allow for detection and quantitative analysis of potential negative effects at ranges from the sound source where SARA-prohibited impacts may occur, including beyond the defined safety zone.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2015-01-01,ZOOREC:ZOOR15311067877,,

The Egyptian Mediterranean coast receives huge volumes of wastewaters every year through the coastal lagoons and from other land-based effluents. These wastes are loaded by variable amounts and types of pollutants, in addition to great amount of nitrogenous and phosphorous compounds, which in turn cause high level of eutrophication along a significant part of the Mediterranean coast, particularly of both the Nile Delta region and Alexandria coast.

The variation in the phytoplankton communities and biomass as well as the impacts of environmental factors including dissolved methane was studied. Results indicated that the gas hydrate drilling area in Dongsha, SCS exhibited a typical low-nutrients low-chlorophyll a (LNLC) environment accompanied with low phytoplankton abundance. A total of 103 taxa belonging to 52 genera of 5 classes were identified, with diatoms and dinofiagellates dominating the community. Both phytoplankton abundance and chlorophyll a (Chl a) were highest at the subsurface maximum layer. The subsurface chlorophyll maximum (SCM) before and after drilling were stabilized at 75 m (0.30 +/- 0.06 mg/m(3) and 0.51 +/- 0.29 mg/m(3), respectively), while the subsurface maximum of abundance after drilling went deeper to 75 m (604.17 +/- 313.22 cells/L) from the surface (707.14 +/- 243.98 cells/L) before drilling. After drilling, phosphate and Chl a increased significantly, but no significant differences were observed on abundance. Dominant species of diatoms were basically constant with dinofiagellates becoming more apparent in higher occurrence and abundance, while Cyanophyta was diverse after drilling. Redundancy analysis (RDA) and Spearman's correlation analysis both indicated that temperature, pH and phosphates were major factors causing fluctuation in phytoplankton community structure, while dissolved methane had non-significant impact directly. We clearly found both abundance and Chl a increased in particular water layers (between 50 and 75 m) and at stations (DS06, DS08 and DS15) where dissolved methane concentrations were also abnormally high. This study appeared to partly coincide with the findings of natural oil seeps in the Gulf of Mexico, which assumed that the turbulence from the natural oil and gas leaking zone could raise the bottom water through the rising bubbles and bring cold nutrient rich waters to the thermocline from the deep seeps.

So far, global carbon budget estimates have implicitly assumed that the transformation and lateral transport of carbon along this aquatic continuum has remained unchanged since pre-industrial times. A synthesis of published work reveals the magnitude of present-day lateral carbon fluxes from land to ocean, and the extent to which human activities have altered these fluxes. We show that anthropogenic perturbation may have increased the flux of carbon to inland waters by as much as 1.0 Pg C yr(-1) since pre-industrial times, mainly owing to enhanced carbon export from soils. Most of this additional carbon input to upstream rivers is either emitted back to the atmosphere as carbon dioxide (similar to 0.4 Pg C yr(-1)) or sequestered in sediments (similar to 0.5 Pg C yr(-1)) along the continuum of freshwater bodies, estuaries and coastal waters, leaving only a perturbation carbon input of similar to 0.1 Pg C yr(-1) to the open ocean. According to our analysis, terrestrial ecosystems store similar to 0.9 Pg C yr(-1) at present, which is in agreement with results from forest inventories but significantly differs from the figure of 1.5 Pg C yr(-1) previously estimated when ignoring changes in lateral carbon fluxes. We suggest that carbon fluxes along the land-ocean aquatic continuum need to be included in global carbon dioxide budgets.",,,,,,,,,830,66,0,0,444,1,933,,,1752-0894,1752-0908,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Libre Bruxelles, Dept Earth & Environm Sci, B-1050 Brussels, BelgiumUniv Exeter, Coll Engn Math & Phys Sci, Exeter EX4 4QF, Devon, EnglandLab Sci Climat & Environnement, F-91190 Gif Sur Yvette, FranceUniv Hawaii Manoa, Sch Ocean & Earth Sci & Technol, Dept Oceanog, Honolulu, HI 96822 USASwiss Fed Inst Technol, Dept Environm Sci, Inst Biogeochem & Pollutant Dynam, CH-8092 Zurich, SwitzerlandUniv Antwerp, Dept Biol, B-2160 Antwerp, BelgiumInst Biogeochem & Marine Chem, D-20146 Hamburg, GermanyUniv Calif San Diego, Scripps Inst Oceanog, La Jolla, CA 92093 USAUniv Bristol, Sch Geog Sci, Bristol BS8 1SS, Avon, EnglandUniv N Carolina, Dept Marine Sci, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USAUniv Liege, Chem Oceanog Unit, Inst Phys B5, B-4000 Liege, BelgiumGEOMAR Helmholtz Zentrum Ozeanforsch Kiel, D-24148 Kiel, GermanyUniv Exeter, Dept Geog, Exeter EX4 4RJ, Devon, EnglandUniv Toulouse 3, Observ Midipyrenees, CNRS, Geosci Environm Toulouse, F-31400 Toulouse, FranceUniv Bergen, Inst Geophys, N-5007 Bergen, NorwayBjerknes Ctr Climate Res, N-5007 Bergen, NorwayUni Res, Uni Bjerknes Ctr, N-5007 Bergen, NorwayMax Planck Inst Meteorol, D-20146 Hamburg, GermanyUniv Bern, Inst Phys, CH-3012 Bern, SwitzerlandUniv Bern, Oeschger Ctr Climate Change Res, CH-3012 Bern, SwitzerlandUniv So Calif, Dept Earth Sci, Los Angeles, CA 90089 USAAgroscope Res Stn ART, CH-8046 Zurich, SwitzerlandRoyal Netherlands Inst Sea Res, NL-4401 NT Yerseke, NetherlandsVrije Univ Brussel, Dept Analyt & Environm Chem, B-1050 Brussels, BelgiumUniv Liege, Lab Phys Atmospher & Planetaire, B-4000 Liege, BelgiumYale Sch Forestry & Environm Studies, New Haven, CT 06511 USAUniv E Anglia, Sch Environm Sci, Norwich NR4 7TJ, Norfolk, EnglandHelmholtz Ctr Environm Res, Dept Environm Microbiol, D-04318 Leipzig, Germany",,,,2013-08-01,WOS:000322441900008,,

The bacterial oxidation of light hydrocarbons can directly or indirectly bring about significant changes in the values of pH and Eh of the surrounding environment, thereby also changing the stability fields of the different mineral species present in that environment. The paper reports the role of hydrocarbon microseepage in surface alterations of trace metal concentrations. In this study trace metal alterations were mapped that appear to be associated with hydrocarbon microseepages in the oil/gas fields. A total of 50 soil samples were collected near oil and gas fields of the Tatipaka and Pasarlapudi areas of the Krishna Godavari Basin, Andhra Pradesh. The soil samples were collected from a depth of 2-2.5 m. The paper reports the chemical alterations associated with trace metals in soils that are related to hydrocarbon microseepages above some of the major oil and gas fields of this petroliferous region. Trace metals, such as scandium (Sc), vanadium (V), chromium (Cr), cobalt (Co), nickel (Ni), copper (Cu), zinc (Zn), barium (Ba) and strontium (Sr), in soil samples were analyzed using inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). The concentrations of Sc (8 to 40 mg/kg), V (197 to 489 mg/kg), Cr (106 to 287 mg/kg), Co (31 to 52 mg/kg), Ni (65 to 110 mg/kg), Cu (88 to 131 mg/kg), Zn (88 to 471 mg/kg), Ba (263 to 3,091 mg/kg) and Sr (119 to 218 mg/kg) were obtained. It was observed that the concentrations of trace elements were tremendously increased when they were compared with their normal concentrations in soils. The analysis of adsorbed soil gas showed the presence of high concentrations of I C2+ pound (C2H6, C3H8 and n-C4H10) ranging from 7 to 222 mu g/kg respectively. Integrated studies of trace elements over adsorbed light gaseous hydrocarbons (I C2+) pound anomalies showed good correlation with the existing oil and gas wells. The carbon isotopic composition of delta C-13(1) of the samples ranges between -36.6aEuro degrees to -22.7aEuro degrees (Pee Dee Belemnite) values indicate thermogenic origin, which presents convincing evidence that the adsorbed soil gases collected from these sediments are of catagenetic origin. The increase in the concentrations of trace metals near oil/gas producing areas, suggests a soil chemical change to a reducing environment, presumably due to the influence of hydrocarbon microseepage, which could be applied with other geoscientific data to identify areas of future hydrocarbon exploration in frontier areas.",,,,,,,,,6,2,0,0,3,0,8,,,1672-5107,1995-8226,,,,,,,,,,"CSIR, Natl Geophys Res Inst, Petr Geochem Grp, Microbiol Lab, Hyderabad 500007, Andhra Pradesh, India",,,,2013-03-20,WOS:000314707800002,,

We used a long-term (10 month) in situ experiment with two phylogenetically diverse scleractinians (Acropora palmataandPorites porites) to test how coral-symbiotic algal interactions changed under real-world conditions that were a priori expected to be beneficial (fish-mediated nutrients) and to be harmful, but non-lethal, for coral (fish + anthropogenic nutrients). Analyzing nine response variables of nutrient stoichiometry and stable isotopes per coral fragment, we found that nutrients from fish positively affected coral growth, and moderate doses of anthropogenic nutrients had no additional effects. While growing, coral maintained homeostasis in their nutrient pools, showing tolerance to the different nutrient regimes. Nonetheless, structural equation models revealed more nuanced relationships, showing that anthropogenic nutrients reduced the diversity of coral-symbiotic algal interactions and caused nutrient and carbon flow to be dominated by the symbiont. Our findings show that nutrient and carbon pathways are fundamentally rewired under anthropogenic nutrient regimes in ways that could increase corals' susceptibility to further stressors. We hypothesize that our experiment captured coral in a previously unrecognized transition state between mutualism and antagonism. These findings highlight a notable parallel between how anthropogenic nutrients promote symbiont dominance with the holobiont, and how they promote macroalgal dominance at the coral reef scale. Our findings suggest more realistic experimental conditions, including studies across gradients of anthropogenic nutrient enrichment as well as the incorporation of varied nutrient and energy pathways, may facilitate conservation efforts to mitigate coral loss.",,,,,,,,,14,0,0,0,13,0,14,,,1354-1013,1365-2486,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Michigan, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USANorth Carolina State Univ, Dept Appl Ecol, Raleigh, NC USAUniv Alabama Birmingham, Dept Biol, Birmingham, AL 35294 USA",,,,2020-08-05,WOS:000551910800001,32710518,

As sea level rises, changes in flooding and salinity will potentially impact ecological functions, such as organic matter decomposition, that influence carbon storage. However, little is known about the mechanisms that control organic matter loss in coastal wetlands at the landscape scale. As sea level rises, how will the shift from fresh to salt-tolerant plant communities impact organic matter decomposition? Do long-term, plant-mediated, effects of sea-level rise differ from direct effects of elevated salinity and flooding?We identified internal and external factors that regulated indirect and direct pathways of sea-level rise impacts, respectively, along a landscape-scale salinity gradient that incorporated changes in wetland type (fresh, oligohaline, mesohaline and polyhaline marshes). We found that indirect and direct impacts of sea-level rise had opposing effects on organic matter decomposition.Salinity had an indirect effect on litter decomposition that was mediated through litter quality. Despite significant variation in environmental conditions along the landscape gradient, the best predictors of above- and below-ground litter decomposition were internal drivers, initial litter nitrogen content and initial litter lignin content respectively. Litter decay constants were greatest in the oligohaline marsh and declined with increasing salinity, and the fraction of litter remaining (asymptote) was greatest in the mesohaline marsh. In contrast, direct effects of salinity and flooding were positive. External drivers, salinity and flooding, stimulated cellulytic activity, which was highest in the polyhaline marsh.Synthesis. Our results indicate that as sea level rises, initial direct effects of salinity will stimulate decay of labile carbon, but over time as plant communities shift from fresh to polyhaline marsh, litter decay will decline, yielding greater potential for long-term carbon storage. These findings highlight the importance of quantifying carbon loss at multiple temporal scales, not only in coastal wetlands but also in other ecosystems where plant-mediated responses to climate change will have significant impacts on carbon cycling.",,,,,,,,,49,2,0,0,32,0,60,,,0022-0477,1365-2745,,,,,,,,,,"US Geol Survey, Wetland & Aquat Res Ctr, Lafayette, LA 70506 USAWater Inst Gulf, Baton Rouge, LA USACoalit Restore Coastal Louisiana, Baton Rouge, LA USALouisiana Dept Wildlife & Fisheries, Baton Rouge, LA USA",Water Inst GulfCoalit Restore Coastal LouisianaLouisiana Dept Wildlife & Fisheries,,,2018-03-01,WOS:000425046300017,,

Recent improvements incorporate better signal-to-noise ratios, multiple frequencies, calibrated arrays and new signal processing functionality. These advancements, combined with parallel improvements in data acquisition methods and post-processing techniques, make the data more accurate, thus providing more reliable survey products.MBES technology now makes use of all aspects of the inherent acoustics to provide additional data products, such as beam intensity, pseudo-sidescan, seafloor backscatter and raw time series backscatter.

At these water depths, the extremely high external pressures, low temperatures, long distance tie-backs and high environmental loads due to waves, currents, and wind combined brings the employed equipment to its operational limit. This paper presents a literature review on failure events experienced by the industry concerning pipelines, risers, and umbilical cables, describing their causes, consequences, and severity. From the several failure modes reported up to now, it is possible to select the ones that are more frequent and deserves attention from academia and industry. Concerning pipelines, the main failure modes reported are due to mechanical damage, corrosion, construction defect, natural hazards and fatigue. Additionally, a vast review of published researches concerning the pipeline-seabed interaction is presented. With regard to floating risers, approximately 85% of them are of flexible type. Although flexible risers may fail in different ways, collapse due to external pressure is reported as the most frequent failure mode. For umbilical cables, the major failure modes are found to occur under tension or compression, torsion, fatigue, wear and sheaving.",,,,,,,,,107,6,0,0,0,0,110,,,0029-8018,1873-5258,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Fed Rio de Janeiro, COPPE, Subsea Technol Lab, Rio De Janeiro, Brazil",,,,2018-02-22,WOS:000424175900032,,

The evolution of the UCH is outlined, taking due account of its origins in the world's traditional societies, and of the process of industrialisation of maritime activities over the past half-millennium. This evolution has occurred in a series of stages, grouped in this paper into the traditional society, the modern age of sail, and the period of steam, iron and steel. The traditional society is regarded as the initial pre-industrial phase of development in all geographical regions. Both the succeeding phases cover the processes of industrialisation of maritime activities over the past half-millennium, respectively before and after the transition from sail to steam power in the 19th century. Approximately half-century stages of technological and economic development characterise both these periods. The surveying of the UCH is discussed first in terms of physical surveying, with particular reference to wreck sites. This has been improved by advances in underwater working, including sonar, seabed mapping, diving and the use of underwater vehicles. It is argued that the valuation of wrecks and cargoes can be conceived in both cultural and economic terms, and that the latter can lead to conflict between salvors on the one hand, and the scientific interest on the other. It is shown that the legal framework for conservation of the UCH is inadequate, both in terms of adjudicating between commercial and scientific interests, and of the jurisdiction of coastal states and the legal protection afforded the UCH beyond coastal state jurisdiction. The initial provisions for integrated management of the UCH, taken in the International Maritime Organisation (IMO), and the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation (UNESCO), are discussed.

As the size of structure increases, it limits the availability of offshore crane facilities. So often large jackets are installed by launching method. This method is also utilized to other type of large structures offshore. As the structure approaches to the tilt beam in the launching barge, it reaches a critical load and there are parameters affecting on launching procedure. The major influential parameters are trim, draft of barge, center of gravity, center of buoyancy and reserved buoyancy of jacket. As increasing of trim and draft structural loads tend to decrease. The trim is found to be more contributing than draft on structural load, therefore the trim should be increased so as to decrease structural loads and to avoid stalling of structure and submergence of stem. During the launching process, the distance between jacket and seabed should be investigated which differs from the amount of reserved buoyancy and launching condition of barge.

However, the moving blades of tidal turbines pose potential collision risks for marine animals. Accurate assessment of mortality risk as a result of collisions is essential for risk management during planning and consenting processes for marine energy developments. In the absence of information on the physical consequences of such collisions, predicting likely risks relies on theoretical collision risk models. The application of these at a population level usually assumes that all collisions result in mortality. This is unlikely and the approach therefore produces upwardly biased estimates of population consequences. In this study, we estimate the pathological consequences of direct collisions with tidal turbines using seal carcasses and physical models of tidal turbine blades. We quantify severe trauma at a range of impact speeds and to different areas of seal carcasses. A dose-response model was developed with associated uncertainty to determine an impact speed threshold of severe trauma to use in future collision risk models. Results showed that severe trauma was restricted to the thoracic region, with no evidence of injury to the lumbar or cervical spine. Pathological indicators of mortality were only predicted to occur in collision speeds in excess of 5.1 m/s (95% C.I. 3.2-6.6) and was affected by body condition; increasing blubber depth reduced the likelihood of severe trauma. Synthesis and applications. This study provides important information for policy makers and regulators looking to predict the potential impacts of tidal turbines on marine mammals. We demonstrate that the probability of severe trauma in seals due to collisions with turbine blades is highly dependent upon collision speed, and that the majority of predicted collisions are unlikely to cause fatal skeletal trauma. We recommend that collision risk models incorporate appropriate mortality assumptions to ensure accurate estimates of the population consequences are produced in risk assessments for tidal turbine deployments.",,,,,,,,,19,0,0,0,9,0,20,,,0021-8901,1365-2664,,,,,,,,,,"Univ St Andrews, Scottish Oceans Inst, Sea Mammal Res Unit, St Andrews, Fife, ScotlandSAC Vet Serv, Scottish Marine Anim Strandings Scheme, Inverness, Scotland",,,,2019-07-24,WOS:000474270200018,,

Temporal dynamics of urban forests in subtropical and tropical forest regions are, until now, little explored and represent a new and important direction for study and management of these ecosystems. This study used permanent plots and statistical models incorporating tree and plot-level covariates to analyze mortality, in-growth, diameter growth, and species composition, as well the socioeconomic and urban morphology factors driving change in San Juan, Puerto Rico's subtropical coastal island urban forests over a nine year period. A total of 87 plots contained 482 trees in 2001 and 749 trees in 2010. Between 2001 and 2010 average tree densities increased, and average annual mortality rates were nearly 30%. Mortality was lower for larger, open-grown, non-leguminous trees and in higher income neighborhoods, but higher for street trees and larger population areas. The most widespread tree was invasive Spathodea campanulata, but overall, average mortality was higher for invasive than non-invasive tree species. In-growth of invasive species increased with human population, while higher tree densities corresponded with increased in-growth of native species. Overall mean diameter growth rate was 0.98 cm/yr, but remnant forest patch growth rates were 0.35 cm/yr. Higher diameter growth rates were associated with larger human populations, amounts of duff/mulch cover, and open-grown conditions. This study adds new insights to broaden our understanding of these emergent ecosystems in the Caribbean region. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

All combination patterns show clear periods vertically. The RBC is mainly composed of reefs and bioclastic banks, and the dimension of the RBC depends on the scale of the reefs. Bioclastic banks deposits surround the reefs. The range of the ARBI is determined by the scale of algae-reefs, algae peloid dolomite microfacies and algal dolomite microfacies deposit alternating vertically. TLCAB and TLCRB are deposited as layer-cakes stacking in cycles and extending widely with cross bedding developed. The grains of TLCAB and TLCRB are diverse and multi-source.

Yet, no adequate methodology exists that provides reliable predictions of how environmental degradation will affect these ecosystems at a relevant level of biological organization. The primary objective of this study was to develop a methodology to evaluate a fish's capacity to face a well-established environmental challenge, an exposure to chemically dispersed oil, and characterize the long-term consequences. Therefore, we applied high-throughput, non-lethal challenge tests to assess hypoxia tolerance, temperature susceptibility and maximal swimming speed as proxies for a fish's functional integrity. These whole animal challenge tests were implemented before (1 month) and after (1 month) juvenile European sea bass (Dicentrarchus labrax) had been acutely exposed (48 h) to a mixture containing 0.08 g L-1 of weathered Arabian light crude oil plus 4% dispersant (Corexit(C) EC9500A), a realistic exposure concentration during an oil spill. In addition, experimental populations were then transferred into semi-natural tidal mesocosm ponds and correlates of Darwinian fitness (growth and survival) were monitored over a period of 4 months. Our results revealed that fish acutely exposed to chemically dispersed oil remained impaired in terms of their hypoxia tolerance and swimming performance, but not in temperature susceptibility for 1 month post-exposure. Nevertheless, these functional impairments had no subsequent ecological consequences under mildly selective environmental conditions since growth and survival were not impacted during the mesocosm pond study. Furthermore, the earlier effects on fish performance were presumably temporary because re-testing the fish 10 months post-exposure revealed no significant residual effects on hypoxia tolerance, temperature susceptibility and maximal swimming speed. We propose that the functional proxies and correlates of Darwinian fitness used here provide a useful assessment tool for fish health in the marine environment. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

During the post-calving period, 51% and 35% of caribou moved through two constricted zones to the east and west of Teshekpuk Lake, respectively, and accessed insect-relief habitat along the Beaufort Sea coast. During late summer and early fall, TCH caribou were concentrated to the southeast and southwest of Teshekpuk Lake. Although 65% of the Teshekpuk caribou wintered in two areas on the central coastal plain around the village of Atqasuk and south of Teshekpuk Lake, other TCH animals wintered in a great variety of places, including the Seward Peninsula, the eastern and southern Brooks Range, and the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. We detected an apparent emigration rate of 6.9%. One male and five female TCH caribou joined the breeding populations of the Western Arctic and Central Arctic herds. TCH caribou traveled an average distance of 2348 190 km annually. Movement rates were at a maximum in midsummer, lowest in winter, and intermediate during spring and fall migrations. Restrictions on oil and gas leasing and surface occupancy have been in place to protect calving, migratory corridors, and insect-relief habitat for the TCH, but these protections are likely to be removed. These data will provide a good baseline that can be used to compare predevelopment distribution and movement patterns of TCH caribou to distribution and movement patterns during and after petroleum development.",,,,,,,,,30,0,0,0,29,0,37,,,0004-0843,1923-1245,,,,,,,,,,"N Slope Borough Dept Wildlife Management, Barrow, AK 99723 USAABR, Inc Environm Res & Serv, Fairbanks, AK 99708 USAAlaska Dept Fish & Game, Barrow, AK 99723 USAUS Bureau Land Management, Fairbanks, AK 99709 USA",N Slope Borough Dept Wildlife ManagementABRUS Bureau Land Management,,,2007-09-01,WOS:000250316500003,,

The calculated mean depths of DDLs were -1.1 km, -3.4 kin, -9.1 km and -31.0 km. The mean depth of -1.1 km DDL was interpreted as regional unconformity shown in about 1 second in two way travel time (TWTT) in the seismic reflection profiles, and the mean depth of -3.4 km DDL was also interpreted as top of the acoustic basement in the seismic reflection profiles. Comparing with well data, seismic reflection profiles and regional geology in the study area, the mean depth of -9.1 km DDL was interpreted as top of the igneous origin basement. This means that the acoustic basement of the study area is composed mainly of sediments which are disregarded in previous study. The mean depth of -31.0 km DDL was interpreted as the Moho discontinuity because this mean depth is similar to one of the normal continental crust thickness. The detection of top of the igneous origin basement suggests that oil . gas potential analysis in Kunsan Basin needs to be extended to the deeper part of sediments (acoustic basement).",,,,,,,,,4,0,0,0,0,0,4,,,1225-7281,2288-7962,,,,,,,,,,"Korea Inst Geosci & Mineral Resources, Daejeon 305350, South Korea",,,,2007-12-01,WOS:000439514500004,,

But how does innovation happen in the industry? Specifically, what ideas and inputs flow from which parts of the sector's value network, and where do these inputs go? And how do firms and organizations from different countries contribute differently to this process? This paper puts forward the results of a survey designed to shed light on these questions. Carried out in collaboration with the Society of Petroleum Engineers (SPE), the survey was sent to 469 executives and senior managers who played a significant role with regard to R&D and/or technology deployment in their respective business units. A total of 199 responses were received from a broad range of organizations and countries around the world. Several interesting themes and trends emerge from the results, including: (1) service companies tend to file considerably more patents per innovation than other types of organization; (2) over 63% of the deployed innovations reported in the survey originated in service companies; (3) neither universities nor government-led research organizations were considered to be valuable sources of new information and knowledge in the industry's R&D initiatives; and (4) despite the increasing degree of globalization in the marketplace, the USA still plays an extremely dominant role in the industry's overall R&D and technology deployment activities. By providing a detailed and objective snapshot of how innovation happens in the upstream oil & gas sector, this paper provides a valuable foundation for future investigations and discussions aimed at improving how R&D and technology deployment are managed within the industry. The methodology did result in a coverage bias within the survey, however, and the limitations arising from this are explored. (c) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Several approaches have been used to reduce Typha dominance and restore invaded wetlands, but long-term studies assessing benefits of these restoration efforts are limited. A previous study demonstrated that aboveground harvesting of Typha x glauca stems and litter reduced Typha dominance 2 years post-treatment in a Great Lakes coastal wetland. In the current study, we extended monitoring of experimental aboveground Typha harvest to 4 years post-treatment and added assessments of treatment effects on soil nutrients, carbon emissions, and microbial community composition. Aboveground harvest treatment resulted in a dramatic reduction in Typha litter cover that persisted for 4 years, increased soil temperature, and increased abundance of the native plant genus Carex. However, aboveground harvest treatment did not significantly reduce Typha abundance, nor did it have significant effects on soil nutrient concentrations, carbon fluxes, or the taxonomic composition of soil microbial communities. We did observe differences in bacterial community composition between plots based on time since Typha invasion, which may indicate some legacy effects of Typha invasion. At the scale of this experiment (4 x 4 m plots), our results indicate that a single aboveground removal of Typha x glauca is not sufficient to restore a heavily invaded freshwater wetland ecosystem, and that periodic harvesting of Typha stems and litter may be required to maintain native plant abundance.",,,,,,,,,15,0,0,0,14,0,19,,,1061-2971,1526-100X,,,,,,,,,,"Loyola Univ Chicago, Dept Biol, 1032 West Sheridan Rd, Chicago, IL 60660 USALoyola Univ Chicago, Inst Environm Sustainabil, 6349 N Kenmore Ave, Chicago, IL 60660 USADepaul Univ, Dept Environm Sci & Studies, 1 E Jackson Blvd, Chicago, IL 60604 USAUniv Connecticut, Dept Nat Resources & Environm, Ctr Environm Sci & Engn, 1376 Storrs Rd Unit 4087, Storrs, CT 06269 USA",,,,2019-03-01,WOS:000461699300017,,

Both environmental risk assessment and chemical and biological effects monitoring are part of the evaluation of environmental impacts under OSPAR. The European Union Technical Guidance Document on risk assessment (EU-TGD; EC, 2003) is the OSPAR sanctioned approach for estimating and reducing environmental impacts from toxic substances (OSPAR agreement 20-2003). A key element of OSPAR's 1999, Strategy on Environmental Goals and Management Mechanism for Offshore Activities is the assessment of the effectiveness of measures adopted for the prevention and elimination of pollution of the maritime area. OSPAR has recognised that a coordinated chemical and biological effects monitoring programme is essential for identifying the nature and extent of environmental impacts. A guidance document for the design and conduct of monitoring programmes has been published (OSPAR, 2004). However, not all the tools and methods needed for the undertaking of such monitoring (e.g. water column impacts) have yet been fully developed or validated.Although both tools have the same assessment endpoint (occurrence of biological effects in the environment), the results of environmental effect monitoring studies and environmental risk assessment models have not been rigorously compared in light of the different factors under consideration between the two methodologies. Nonetheless, validation is required to ensure that the assessments are reliable, ranging from field validation of (laboratory) test endpoints (field monitoring) to performance testing of assessment models.Based on the two tier approach described, an overview of the development of the present regulations and requirements for NW Europe concerning risk assessment and monitoring is presented.

Globally, valuation research has increased markedly over the past two decades, partly due to the influence of environmentalism and the notable depletion of ES. Using meta-analysis of 1156 peer-reviewed journal articles from 1994 to 2017, this study assesses forest ES valuation, focusing on temporal trends, methodological approaches, the types of services most frequently evaluated, and the origin of ES valuation research, especially biomes, economy, and management modalities. Findings suggest that western European countries, including the UK, had the highest number of publications (33%) followed by the United States (15%) and China (13%). Countries with lower middle and low income collectively share only about 14% of the total publications, indicating a large gap in ES research in these countries. In terms of valuation methods, monetary valuation was initially popular, while non-monetary valuation using modelling and mapping methods is gaining popularity. The study revealed that more than 80% of studies have consistently assessed multiple functions of forests but largely focus on regulating services (carbon storage/sequestration/climate regulation). Similarly, about 57% of total ES research was carried out on public land, government managed forests and protected areas, whereas less than 3% was on community-based forestry (CBF), which shares more than 15% and 31% of the forests in developed and developing countries, respectively. Whilst ES publications on forestry have seen significant increases, valuation studies in countries with high biodiversity are conspicuously unrepresented; particularly on forests in mountain regions in low to lower-middle income countries.

J,,,,,,,,,Mike Clare,,Developing a Global Listening Network for Turbidity Currents and Seafloor Processes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Awarded Grant,Nov 01 2019,2019,"This ambitious project can make a major step-change in understanding of seafloor processes and geohazards by developing a listening network based on low-cost hydrophones (via acoustic noise in water column) and geophones (via ground shaking). This type of low-cost network has unusually widespread applications, but here we aim to answer fundamental questions about how submarine mass-flows (turbidity currents and landslides) are triggered, and then behave. These hazardous and often powerful (2-20 m/s) submarine events form the largest sediment accumulations, deepest canyons, and longest channel systems on our planet. Turbidity currents can runout for hundreds to thousands of kilometres, to break seabed cable networks that carry >95% of global data traffic, including the internet and financial markets, or strategic oil and gas pipelines. These flows play a globally important role in organic carbon and nutrient transfer to the deep ocean, and geochemical cycles; whilst their deposits host valuable oil and gas reserves worldwide. Submarine mass flows are notoriously difficult to measure in action, and there are very few measurements compared to their subaerial cousins. This means there are fundamental gaps in basic understanding about how submarine mass flows are triggered, their frequency and runout, and how they behave. Recent monitoring has made advances using power-hungry (active source) sensors, such as acoustic Doppler current profilers (ADCPs). But active-source sensors have major disadvantages, and cannot be deployed globally. They can only measure for short periods, are located on moorings anchored inside these powerful flows (which often carry the expensive mooring and sensors away), and they need multiple periods of expensive research vessels to be both deployed and recovered. We will therefore design, build and test passive sensors that can be deployed over widespread areas at far lower cost. These novel sensors will record mass-flow timing and triggers; and changes in front speed (from transit times), and flow power (via strength of acoustic or vibration signal).We will first determine how submarine mass flows are best recorded by hydrophones and geophones, and how that record varies with flow speed and type, or distance to sensor. Our preliminary work at three sites already shows that hydrophone and geophones do record mass-flows. Here we will determine the best way to capture that mass-flow signal, and to distinguish it from other processes. This will form the basis for then designing and field testing a new generation of low-cost smart sensors, which return data without expensive surface vessels; via pop-up floats and satellite links. Advances in technology make this project timely, as they allow on-board data processing by smart hydrophones to reduce data volumes, which can be triggered to record for short periods at much higher frequency. We will test the new smart sensors, and use them to answer two major science questions. First, do submarine flows in different settings show consistent modes of behaviour? Second, what triggers submarine flows in river-fed systems, and how are they linked to major river floods, earthquakes, and tropical cyclones? To do this, we will place these new sensors along the Congo Canyon (dilute river, passive margin, no cyclones) off West Africa, and the Gaoping Canyon (hyperpycnal river, active margin, frequent cyclones) offshore Taiwan.These sensors have other widespread applications. Low cost warning sensors would be a major advance for offshore hazard assessment, and leaks from CCS facilities or gas pipelines. Sensors that record landslides would be a step change for tsunami warning systems, or threats to valuable seabed infrastructure. This proposal is also particularly timely, because of advances in technology now allow on-board data processing and communication between smart sensors, which can be triggered to record for short periods at much higher frequency.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,NE/S009965/2,,,,,,,,National Oceanography Centre (WEF011019),National Oceanography Centre (WEF011019),,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:15372343,,

Here, listening space reductions (LSR) for harbour porpoises (Phocoena phocoena) and harbour seals (Phoca vitulina) were assessed in winter and summer for two tidal energy devices of different designs. Results demonstrated that LSR was influenced by type of turbine, species, and season. For instance, LSRs for harbour seals were in excess of 80% within 60 m, whilst for harbour porpoises they were in excess of 55% within 10 m of the devices. For both species, LSRs were highest during winter, characterised by low ambient noise conditions. These findings highlight the importance of assessing masking over seasons, as masking effects are highly influenced by ambient noise conditions. Understanding the natural variation within seasons is also particularly relevant for tidal turbine noise assessments as devices are typically situated in highly dynamic environments. Since masking effects occur at the lower level of behavioural impacts in marine mammals, assessing the spatial extent of masking as part of environmental impact assessments is recommended. The listening space formula, which is largely based on measurable environmental factors (device and ambient noise), is transferable to any MRE device, or arrays, for any species (for which an audiogram can be assumed) and therefore provides an effective method to better inform MRE pre- and post-consenting processes.",,,,,,,,,21,1,0,0,7,0,21,,,1364-0321,,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Victoria, Dept Biol, Victoria, BC V8P 5C2, CanadaQueens Univ, Marine Lab, Sch Nat & Built Environm, 12-13 Strand, Portaferry BT22 1PF, North IrelandScottish Govt, Marine Scotland Sci, Marine Lab, 375 Victoria Rd, Aberdeen AB11 9DB, Scotland",Queens Univ,,,2019-02-13,WOS:000456745900005,,

In order to reduce the risk of spatial conflict and to enable decision-making based on the co-existence of the two sectors, it is important to gain a better understanding of the attitudes of fishermen towards the development of MRE projects in their locality. A survey was designed to provide quantitative information on fishermen's attitudes to marine renewable energy and the perceived impacts and opportunities. Three MRE developments which have been proposed around the island of Ireland (comprising Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland) were chosen as case study sites in which to carry out the survey. The sites represent offshore wind, wave and tidal energy respectively and are in differing stages of development. In total, 104 complete surveys were conducted with fishermen located at ports in the vicinity of the case study sites. 40% of those surveyed agreed that it is important to develop marine renewable energy in their locality. A further 15% were neutral on this matter. It is encouraging for developers and policy makers that the majority of respondents (70%) were of the opinion that fisheries and MRE projects can co-exist.

These are the so-called first generation Tidal Energy Converters (TEC), and they are usually fixed to the seabed by gravity. When carrying out maintenance tasks on these devices it is, therefore, necessary to remove the nacelles from their bases and raise them to the surface of the sea. They must subsequently be placed back on their bases. These tasks require special high performance ships, signifying high maintenance costs. The automation of emersion and immersion maneuvers will undoubtedly lead to lower costs, given that ships with less demanding requirements will be required for the aforementioned maintenance tasks. This research presents a simple two degrees of freedom dynamic model that can be used to control a first generation TEC that has been conceived of to harness energy from marine currents. The control of the system is carried out by means of a water ballast system located inside the nacelle of the main power unit and is used as an actuator to produce buoying vertical forces. A nonlinear control law based on a decoupling term for the closed loop depth and/or orientation control is also proposed in order to ensure adequate behavior when the TEC performs emersion and immersion maneuvers with only hydrostatic buoyancy forces. The control scheme is composed of an inner loop consisting of a linear and decoupled input/output relationship and the vector of friction and compressibility terms and an outer loop that operates with the tracking error vector in order to ensure the asymptotically exponential stability of the TEC posture. Finally, the effectiveness of the dynamic model and the controller approach is demonstrated by means of numerical simulations when the TEC is carrying out an emersion maneuver for the development of general maintenance tasks and an emersion maneuver for blade-cleaning maintenance tasks.",,,,,,,,,10,0,0,0,0,0,10,,,,1996-1073,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Castilla La Mancha, Escuela Ingenieros Ind Albacete, Albacete 02071, SpainUniv Politecn Madrid, Escuela Tecn Super Ingenieros Navales, E-28040 Madrid, Spain",,,,2016-10-12,WOS:000383547900082,,

With this expansion came a demand for reliable and continuous ocean current measurements throughout the water column over deeper ranges than previously required. Meeting this demand has required developing new systems that combine new instrumentation, deployment schemes, and real time software for data display and forecasting.This paper discusses some of the problems that had to be solved in meeting this new demand. Operating acoustic instrumentation such as ADCPs around oil and gas platforms has to combat both acoustic noise sources and obstacles in the water, The noise sources include plant and platform noise as well as flow noise generated by thrusters. The noise problem worsens as the acoustic systems operate at lower frequencies. Submerged obstacles that can interfere with the ADCP's acoustic beams include legs, lines, and risers.In this paper, we discuss data and field experiences from collaborative work between RD Instruments, Fugro/GEOS, and Shell E & P Technology Company.

Microorganisms have played a central role in degrading and reducing the impact of the spilled oil during past oil disasters. However, in the Arctic, and in particular in its pristine areas, the self-cleaning capacity and biodegradation potential of the natural microbial communities have yet to be uncovered.This review compiles and investigates the current knowledge with respect to environmental parameters and biochemical constraints that control oil biodegradation in the Arctic. Hereby, seawaters off Greenland are considered as a case study. Key factors for biodegradation include the bioavailability of hydrocarbons, the presence of hydro-carbon-degrading bacteria and the availability of nutrients. We show how these key factors may be influenced by the physical oceanographic conditions in seawaters off Greenland and other environmental parameters including low temperature, sea ice, sunlight regime, suspended sediment plumes and phytoplankton blooms that characterize the Arctic.Based on the acquired insights, a first qualitative assessment of the biodegradation potential in seawaters off Greenland is presented. In addition to the most apparent Arctic characteristics, such as low temperature and sea ice, the impact of typical Arctic features such as the oligotrophic environment, poor microbial adaptation to hydrocarbon degradation, mixing of stratified water masses, and massive phytoplankton blooms and suspended sediment plumes merit to be topics of future investigation.

Located between the coastal ocean and coastal watersheds, salt marshes are often heavily influenced by human activities. Many receive high nitrate input from land, degrading water quality and leading in some cases to harmful algal blooms and low oxygen zones harmful to fish. Previous research has shown that salt marshes can act as cleansing sites where pollutant nitrate can be transformed to harmless nitrogen gas and released to the atmosphere. This occurs through heterotrophic denitrification, a microbe-mediated process that transforms plant-available nitrate to nitrogen gas (N2) using organic carbon. However, this transformation to harmless nitrogen gas is not always the fate of salt marsh nitrate. More recent research suggests that the forms of sulfur and carbon compounds in the marsh sediment directly affect the types of microbes and their activities determining nitrate?s fate, i.e. sulfur, nitrogen, and carbon transformations are all linked via microbial activities. For example, instead of being converted to nitrogen gas, nitrate can be converted to ammonium via the microbially controlled process dissimilatory nitrate reduction (DNRA). This different fate of nitrate is environmentally important in several ways. If nitrate is converted to nitrogen gas, it is lost from the ecosystem to the atmosphere, whereas if DNRA dominates nitrate reduction, pollutant nitrogen remains in the system as ammonium. Also, depending on the type of microbial process governing nitrate?s fate, if organisms are using nitrate to help degrade organic matter, less carbon is stored in the ecosystem, potentially influencing the ability of marshes to keep up with sea level rise. To investigate the environmental and microbial controls affecting the fate of nitrate in salt marshes, lab and field experiments will be carried out at Plum Island Estuary. The project focuses on sulfur-oxidizing bacteria, a group of particularly important chemosynthetic microbes that use energy trapped in sulfur compounds in sediment to for energy production, and thus contribute to carbon storage. The proposed studies aim (1) to identify sulfur-oxidizers present in sediment densely populated with the salt marsh grass, Spartina alterniflora, and to examine their gene expression linked to sulfur and nitrate processing under shifting environmental conditions; and (2) to combine this molecular information with measurements of rates and characteristics of biogeochemical reactions occurring in the sediment to detect whether sulfur-oxidizer-linked DNRA (thus retention of nitrogen in the ecosystem) or denitrification (thus loss of nitrogen gas from the ecosystem) dominates under specific environmental conditions.

This multidisciplinary research integrates biogeochemical process measurements with molecular analyses, and will be synergistic with ongoing studies at the Plum Island Ecosystem Long-Term Ecological Research (PIE-LTER) site.

The project focuses on sulfur-oxidizing bacteria, a group of particularly important chemosynthetic microbes that use energy trapped in sulfur compounds in sediment to for energy production, and thus contribute to carbon storage. The proposed studies aim (1) to identify sulfur-oxidizers present in sediment densely populated with the salt marsh grass, Spartina alterniflora, and to examine their gene expression linked to sulfur and nitrate processing under shifting environmental conditions; and (2) to combine this molecular information with measurements of rates and characteristics of biogeochemical reactions occurring in the sediment to detect whether sulfur-oxidizer-linked DNRA (thus retention of nitrogen in the ecosystem) or denitrification (thus loss of nitrogen gas from the ecosystem) dominates under specific environmental conditions. Broader Impacts. This multidisciplinary research integrates biogeochemical process measurements with molecular analyses, and will be synergistic with ongoing studies at the Plum Island Ecosystem Long-Term Ecological Research (PIE-LTER) site. Salt marshes provide a variety of ecosystem services to humanity, including nutrient removal and storm protection, but they are under pressure from increasing coastal development and rising sea level. A detailed understanding of marsh microbial function will likely contribute to restoration efforts, particularly if the form of sulfur present in marshes allows prediction of whether pollutant nitrogen will most likely be lost (as nitrogen gas) or retained over time. Project personnel will participate as research supervisors or teachers in MBL?s annual fall Semester in Environmental Science, which each year draws mostly women from undergraduate liberal arts colleges into rigorous classroom learning and individual ecosystems research. One post-doc will also be trained in this interdisciplinary atmosphere, and collaboration between PIE-LTER and Massachusetts Audubon Society provides a conduit for the investigators to teach middle and high school students about nitrogen loading from human activities on land, and its effects in local estuaries.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,1050557,,,,,,,,Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution,,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:13831868,,

Urban plantings also have the potential to contribute significant ecological values by increasing urban habitat for animals such as arthropods and by increasing plant productivity. In this study, we evaluated how the provision of these additional ecological values is affected by plant species richness; the availability of essential resources for plants, such as water, light, space; and soil characteristics. We sampled 33 plantings located on the exterior of three buildings in the urban center of Brisbane, Australia (subtropical climatic region) over 2, 6 week sampling periods characterized by different temperature and rainfall conditions. Plant cover was estimated as a surrogate for productivity as destructive sampling of biomass was not possible. We measured weekly light levels (photosynthetically active radiation), plant CO2 assimilation, soil CO2 efflux, and arthropod diversity. Differences in plant cover were best explained by a three-way interaction of plant species richness, management water regime and sampling period. As the richness of plant species increased in a planter, productivity and total arthropod richness also increased significantly likely due to greater habitat heterogeneity and quality. Overall we found urban plantings can provide additional ecological values if essential resources are maintained within a planter such as water, light and soil temperature. Diverse urban plantings that are managed with these principles in mind can contribute to the attraction of diverse arthropod communities, and lead to increased plant productivity within a dense urban context.",,,,,,,,,5,0,0,0,4,0,6,,,1664-462X,,,,,,,,,,,"Queensland Univ Technol, Sch Earth Environm & Biol Sci, Brisbane, Qld 4001, AustraliaQueensland Univ Technol, Sch Design, Brisbane, Qld 4001, AustraliaSao Paulo State Univ, Agr Sci Fac, Dept Forest Sci, Botucatu, SP, Brazil",,,,2014-10-30,WOS:000344744100001,25400642,

This policy focuses on both a reduction in nuclear and coal-fired power plants and further development of eco-friendly and sustainable power generation and supply. The South Korean government is thus planning a large-scale transition toward improved energy efficiency as well as safe and clean energy sources. Its announced goal is to supply a 20% share of renewable energy in the national energy mix, including 37 GW of photovoltaic power, 3 GW of onshore wind power, and 13 GW of offshore wind power by 2030; the latter is expected to play a strategic role in the Renewable Energy 2030 plan. As South Korea's geographic conditions enable large-scale offshore wind farm projects that are relatively free from complaints and visual effects caused by transportation, installation, noise, vibration, and damage to natural environments, it is highly likely that wind power will become one of the nation's major renewable electricity sources. This paper discusses the potential for developing offshore wind farm projects in South Korea with particular focus on analyzing offshore resources and reviewing government policies and support programs that could limit or otherwise challenge the deployment of such projects, with further considerations of policy choices that could improve the deployment of offshore wind power. As the greatest hindrances to offshore wind power development are frequently-changed government policies and support programs, the adoption of consistent, stable, and efficient guidelines and supports would be most beneficial for meeting South Korea's goals of increased offshore wind energy supplies.",,,,,,,,,35,1,0,0,5,0,38,,,1364-0321,1879-0690,,,,,,,,,,"Jeju Natl Univ, Multidisciplinary Grad Sch Program Wind Energy, Jeju Si, South KoreaJeju Natl Univ, Grad Sch, Fac Wind Energy Engn, Jeju Si, South Korea",,,,2019-06-04,WOS:000467752400005,,

A process-based model for mangroves was developed by integrating new features with existing biogeochemical processes in Forest-DNDC for simulating C sequestration and turnover in mangrove ecosystems. The new model is used to assess (1) the dynamics of C, nitrogen and phosphorous in mangrove ecosystems, including above-and below-ground C in saline wetlands, (2) the impacts of ecological drivers, including climate, soil nitrogen and phosphorous deficit and salt stress, on mangrove production, (3) the production of methane, and aerobic and anaerobic oxidation of methane with sulfate, nitrate and nitrite reductions, (4) the contributions of dissolved inorganic C (DIC), dissolved organic C (DOC), particulate organic C (POC) and burial C (BC) to blue C, and (5) impacts of natural and anthropogenic disturbances on C sequestration in mangrove ecosystems. Model sensitivity analysis showed that C sequestration in mangrove ecosystems was highly sensitive to multiple ecological factors, including climate, soil phosphorus, salinity and sulfate, as well as latitude. The responses of different C components to these factors were distinct. The responses of gross and net primary productivity and aboveground biomass to alterations of mean daily temperature (MDT) were quadratic, or increasing or decreasing non-linearly with an increment or decrement in MDT, but leaf production was linear. Similarly, other mangrove C components, such as BC, DIC, DOC and POC, respond substantially to variations of the ecological drivers. The combined effects of the driving factors are complex due to their intricate interactions. For example, while mangrove productivity is sensitive to available phosphorous, phosphorous cannot mitigate the stress imposed by high salinity.

In this paper, a novel hybrid MCDM approach based on the fuzzy analytic network process (ANP), fuzzy decision making trail and evaluation laboratory (DEMATEL) and fuzzy elimination and choice expressing the reality (ELECTRE) methodologies is applied to assist in the site selection of offshore wind farm (OWF) as the renewable energy in the IEP and the ICM frameworks. The aim of this study is to find the best site selection of offshore wind farm for four sites (alternatives) in Bandar Deylam on the Persian Gulf in southwest of Iran. Six criteria (depths and heights, environmental issues, proximity to facilities, economic aspects, resource technical levels and culture) and the related sub-criteria are considered to select proper sites for power station of OWF. The fuzzy ANP method is employed for standpoints of the site selection (goal) subject to the criteria and is performed the criteria subject to the sub-criteria. In addition, due to considering the influences of the criterion to another criterion, the fuzzy DEMATEL is employed in criteria and sub-criteria sections. Moreover, the fuzzy ELECTRE is applied to calculate the decision making matrices of sub-criteria to alternatives. The results show that the alternative A(3) is the best site of OWF for Bandar Deylam. Then A(2), A(4) are the best alternatives and finally alternative A(1) is the worst site. Also, a sensitivity analysis is performed to investigate the robustness of the outcomes of decision making by changing the priorities of the criteria. The results indicate the robustness of this method when the experts' opinions subject to the criteria change. The evaluation criteria and this methodology could be applied to other coastal cities for promoting the progress of ICM towards the goal of sustainability. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

The development and implementation of ocean zoning, especially Marine Protected Area (MPA) networks, is expanding rapidly around the world. At a global scale, ocean zoning and MPAs are being pursued in many processes through a variety of governmental, inter-governmental (e.g. UN agencies, regional bodies), with significant input from non-governmental organizations (NGOs).Ocean industries, e.g. oil and gas, shipping, fisheries, aquaculture, etc. are the principle user group affected by ocean zoning. Important new ocean uses are under development as well, e.g. offshore wind, ocean energy, carbon sequestration. The creation of ocean zones, such as MPA networks, will have major effects on industry access to marine space and resources, with significant implications for exploration, development, production and transport.It is essential that the industry constructively engage with marine spatial management efforts and stakeholders to ensure that the process is well informed and balanced. This will increase the potential for industry to respect the management regulations of ocean areas often far removed from the reach of governments. Unfortunately, industry is often not present at key ocean zoning developments, especially at the international level, and is not engaged in a constructive, coordinated manner that brings together the range of industries operating in the marine environment.Barriers to industry involvement in marine spatial management include: 1) Lack of understanding of the movement and momentum behind ocean zoning efforts; 2) Limited engagement in the multi-stakeholder processes where zoning is moving most rapidly, e.g. Convention on Biological Diversity, because industry is engaged in sectoral processes; 3) Lack of means for engaging the broader ocean business community on marine management and sustainability issues, particularly at a global level.This paper will outline the need, opportunity and progress in creating proactive, constructive industry leadership and collaboration on ocean zoning, including: 1) Developing an understanding of marine spatial management issues, stakeholders and process; 2) Actively engaging in key international multi-stakeholder processes that are pursuing MPAs and other zoning efforts; 3) Building constructive relationships among ocean industries and other ocean zoning stakeholders; 4) Creating practical experience by constructively engaging in ocean zoning developments in a specific regions.",,,,,"28th International Conference on Ocean, Offshore and Arctic Engineering (OAME)28th International Conference on Ocean, Offshore and Arctic Engineering (OAME)","MAY 31-JUN 05, 2009MAY 31-JUN 05, 2009","ASME, Ocean, Offshore & Arctic Engn DivASME, Ocean, Offshore & Arctic Engn Div","Honolulu, HIHonolulu, HI",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,978-0-7918-4344-4,,,,,,,,,"World Ocean Council, Honolulu, HI 96815 USA",World Ocean Council,,,2009-01-01,WOS:000286404300142,,

In pre-Columbian times, sclerophyllous 'matorral' forests largely covered mediterranean Chile. Remnants of the original, continuous matorral can now be found only on relatively humid slopes of the Coastal Range. In the Intermediate Depression, a long central valley, it has been replaced by extensive savannas dominated by the exotic Acacia caven, whereas the matorral remains on dry slopes as isolated shrub clumps. Experimental work suggests that introduced cattle have played a major role in promoting the shift to Acacia savanna, whereas introduced European rabbits prevent the recolonization of clearings by matorral on the slopes. As in other regions of the world, the loss of woodlands in Chile is likely to have resulted in reduced carbon storage capacity and nutrient recycling, and in increased erosion and climatic aridity within the region. Numerous exotic herbs and grasses now dominate the open areas, and experiments indicate that the dry conditions in the absence of woodland cover in combination with loss of soil fertility and severe grazing by introduced mammals has pushed the competitive balance from native to exotic species. These changes are probably very difficult to reverse. Even if grazing is drastically reduced, drought may prevent the recovery of matorral species in much of the region. However, recent theoretical work suggests that if such grazer reduction is timed to coincide with wet El Nino episodes, recovery of the original woodlands may be triggered.",,,,,,,,,88,0,0,0,72,9,99,,,1387-3547,,,,,,,,,,,"Forest Ecology and Forest Management Group, Department of Environmental Sciences, Wageningen University, 6700 AH, P.O.

This is 25 cm below a scenario with unmitigated emissions, but 15 cm above a hypothetical scenario reducing global emissions to zero by 2016. The long-term SLR implications of the two warming goals diverge substantially on a multi-century timescale owing to inertia in the climate system and the differences in rates of SLR by 2100 between the scenarios. By 2300 a 1.5 degrees C scenario could peak sea level at a median estimate of 1.5 m above 2000. The 50% probability scenario for 2 degrees C warming would see sea level reaching 2.7 m above 2000 and still rising at about double the present-day rate. Halting SLR within a few centuries is likely to be achieved only with the large-scale deployment of CO2 removal efforts, for example, combining large-scale bioenergy systems with carbon capture and storage(4).",,,,,,,,,146,13,0,0,36,0,169,,,1758-678X,1758-6798,,,,,,,,,,"Climate Analyt, D-10178 Berlin, GermanyUniv Wageningen & Res Ctr, Environm Syst Anal Grp, NL-6700 AA Wageningen, NetherlandsPotsdam Inst Climate Impact Res PIK, D-14412 Potsdam, GermanyAalto Univ, Dept Real Estate Planning & Geoinformat, Sch Engn, FI-00076 Aalto, Finland",Climate Analyt,,,2012-12-01,WOS:000312433700019,,

J,,,,,,,,,Colm O'Cofaigh,,BRITICE-CHRONO: Constraining rates and style of marine influenced ice sheet decay,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Awarded Grant,Nov 01 2012,2012,"Recent satellite measurements of the Earth's polar ice sheets highlight that changes in ice extent and thickness are occurring at rates far higher than expected. The challenge for researchers is to place these observations into a longer-term context and produce computer models ('ice sheet forecasts') that reliably predict the fate of ice sheets over this century and beyond. Although remote from habitation, the polar ice sheets influence global sea level. Retreat by increased melting and iceberg calving produces higher sea levels and concerns exist that sea level may rise by metres displacing many millions of people, and their livelihoods, from their coastal homes. At this point in time, it is not possible to study the full life cycle of the present Antarctic or Greenland ice sheets as they are still evolving and undergoing large-scale changes. Instead, we will use an ice sheet that has now fully retreated; the ice sheet that covered most of Britain, Ireland and the North Sea during the last ice age. The last British-Irish ice sheet covered up to 1,000,000 km2 at its maximum size, around 25,000 yrs ago, and was relatively small by global standards. However, its character, setting and behaviour have striking parallels with both the modern West Antarctic and Greenland Ice Sheets. Large parts of the British-Irish Ice Sheet were marine-influenced just like in west Antarctica today; and numerous fast-flowing ice streams carried much of its mass, just like in the Greenland Ice Sheet today. All three are or were highly dynamic, in climatically sensitive regions, with marine sectors, ocean-terminating margins and land-based glaciers. All these common factors make the British-Irish Ice Sheet a powerful analogue for understanding ice sheet dynamics on a range of timescales, operating now and in the future.Recent work by members of this consortium has revealed the pattern of ice sheet retreat that once covered the British Isles, as recorded by end moraines and other glacial landforms. Other work by members of this consortium has used sophisticated computer models to simulate the ice sheet's response to climate change at the end of the last Ice Age. However, these models can only be as good as the geological data on which they are based, and the pattern is poorly constrained in time. We need to know more about the style, rate and timing of ice sheet decay in response to past climate change. Such knowledge allows us to further refine computer modelling so that better predictions can be made. The main focus of the project therefore, is to collect sediments and rocks deposited by the last ice sheet that covered the British Isles, and use these, along with organic remains, to date (e.g. by radiocarbon analyses) the retreat of the ice sheet margins. The project will use over 200 carefully chosen sites, dating some 800 samples in order to achieve this. Offshore, samples will be extracted using coring devices lowered from a research ship to the seabed, and onshore by manual sampling and by use of small drilling rigs. Once the samples are dated and added to the pattern information provided by the landforms, maps of the shrinking ice sheet will be produced. These will provide crucial information on the timing and rates of change across the whole ice sheet. The British-Irish Ice Sheet will become the best constrained anywhere in the world and be the benchmark against which ice sheet models are improved and tested in the future.Knowledge on the character and age of the seafloor sediments surrounding the British Isles is also useful for many industrial, archaeological and heritage applications. Accordingly, the project is closely linked to partners interested, for example, in locating offshore windfarms, electricity cables between Britain and Ireland, and heritage bodies aiming to preserve offshore archaeological remains.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,NE/J007196/1,,,,,,,,Durham University,,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:15364520,,

Currently, chemical dispersants have been used during oil spills, although these agents have been increasingly restricted due to their toxic potential. Thus, the aim of the present study was to formulate a biodegradable commercial biosurfactant for application as a dispersant. Biosurfactants are scientifically known biomolecules produced by microorganisms capable of allowing water-oil interaction. Thus, a biosurfactant was produced by the yeast Candida bombicola URM 3718 cultivated in industrial waste and formulated with the addition of a potassium sorbate preservative for fractionated sterilization (tyndallization) and the combination of fluent vaporization with the preservative. After formulation, samples were stored for 120 days, followed by surface tension, emulsification and oil dispersant tests in sea water. The results were promising for the biosurfactant formulated with the preservative, which demonstrated stability and an absence of toxicity in experiments with a marine indicator. The commercial biosurfactant was tested at different pH values, temperatures and in the presence of salt, demonstrating potential industrial application at a cost compatible with the environmental field.

In this study, concentrations of 17 phthalate metabolites were determined in liver samples collected from one hundred (n = 100) by-caught harbor porpoises (Phocoena phocoena) along the coast of Norway. Overall, thirteen phthalate metabolites were detected in the samples. Monoethyl phthalate (mEP), mono-iso-butyl phthalate (mIBP), mono-n-butyl phthalate (mBP) and phthalic acid (PA) were the most abundant metabolites, accounting for detection rates >= 85%. The highest median concentrations were found for mIBP (30.6 ng/g wet weight [w.w.]) and mBP (25.2 ng/g w.w.) followed by PA (7.75 ng/g w.w.) and mEP (5.67 ng/g w.w.). The sum of the median phthalate metabolites concentrations that were found in the majority of samples (detection rates > 50%) indicated that concentrations were lower for porpoises collected along the coastal area of Bodo (Nordland), Lebesby (Finnmark) and Varangerfjord (as compared to other coastal areas); these areas are among the least populated coastal areas but also the most distant (> 700 km) from offshore active oil and gas fields.

Currently, tests for hydrate exploitation from marine sediment have been performed in the Nankai Trough of Japan and the Shenhu area of the South China Sea. Hydrate exploitation is influenced by water-gas flow in the sediment, and considering the huge seawater reserves in hydrate accumulation areas, an experiment of seawater-gas flow was performed to dissociate hydrate. The effects of seawater-gas flow rates and initial hydrate saturation on methane hydrate (MH) production were analyzed. The results showed that seawater-gas flow efficiently promotes hydrate dissociation and inhibits hydrate reformation. Moreover, there was a faster heat and mass transfer with increasing seawater flow rates and decreasing gas flow rates, which enhanced the average MH dissociation rate. In addition, the variation time of the flow channel increased with higher initial hydrate saturation.

Redeployment of the vast resources concentrated in established sectors is one possible way to advance cleantech industries. However, prior research on sustainability transitions tends to emphasize competition and conflict between established sectors and cleantech industries. There is thus a need for exploring in more depth how established sectors may positively contribute to cleantech industries. Based on the notion of structural overlaps, we propose an extended version of the technological innovation systems framework to study how established sectors influence cleantech industries, and present new conceptual definitions and indicators. We apply the framework to a case study of the relationship between the oil and gas sector and the offshore wind power industry in Norway. Our empirical results show that the oil and gas sector has several positive influences on offshore wind power enabled by technological overlaps and diversifying firms. However, misaligned informal institutions weaken such influences, manifested as e.g. conflicting priorities and wavering commitment of diversified oil and gas firms to the new industry. We conclude by discussing the usefulness of the proposed framework and the relevance of our findings for policy and further research. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

This can have a significant effect on the reliability of a mooring system that is designed to satisfy 100 yr conditions with specified Factors of Safety in accordance with IS019901-7 or API RP 2SK. This paper presents reliability analysis of the mooring system of a permanently connected Floating LNG vessel, placed at two locations: (a) a tropical cyclone environment of the North West Shelf of Australia and (b) a winter storm environment of the North Sea. It is demonstrated that as a result of differences in the long term distribution of environmental parameters (waves, winds) between a North Sea environment and a tropical cyclone environment, the long term distribution of the mooring line response differs significantly in these two locations.This paper shows that a mooring system which is designed in accordance with ISO (or API), in these two environments, will achieve very different reliability levels because of the significant differences in environmental characteristics. In order to achieve the same reliability for the mooring system at these two geographical locations, Factors of Safety for use with 100 yr environmental conditions (Ultimate Limit State) were derived to achieve the same target probability of failure of 10(-4)/annum. It was found that for the North Sea environment, a factor of 1.5 is required for both the mooring chain and the pile, while for the tropical cyclone environment the required Factor of Safety has to be increased to 2.1.

In this paper, high-frequency acoustic methods are proposed to localize the oil polluted area and characterize the parameters of its spatial covariance, i.e., variance and correlation. A model is implemented to study the underlying mechanisms of backscattering due to spatial heterogeneity of the medium and predict backscattering returns. An algorithm for synthetically generating stationary, Gaussian random fields is introduced which provides great flexibility in implementing the physical model of an inhomogeneous field with spatial covariance. A method for inference of spatial covariance parameters is proposed to describe the scattering field in terms of its second-order statistics from the backscattered returns. The results indicate that high-frequency acoustic methods not only are suitable for large-scale detection of oil contamination in the water column but also allow inference of the spatial covariance parameters resulting in a statistical description of the oil field.

Although the impacts of climate change on sea ice habitat throughout the circumpolar range of the species is of concern, Hudson Bay is the only region where the duration of sea ice cover has been linked empirically with declines in a suite of parameters: polar bear body condition; individual survival; natality; and population size. Research in Hudson Bay has also focused on contaminants in polar bear tissues, population genetics, behaviour and denning, as well as predator-prey interactions. These decades of research in Hudson Bay provide important baseline information with which to monitor the rate and extent of the impact of climate change on polar bear ecology. Climate change has already become a critical issue for polar bear management in the region; human bear conflicts in Nunavut have increased, which had been an explicit prediction of an effect of climate change. In addition, relative to polar bear numbers in the early 1960s before government-based harvest management polar bear abundance has also increased. The recent empirical data demonstrating a decline in the Western Hudson Bay polar bear subpopulation has been interpreted as incongruous with observations of respected Inuit elders of the marked increase in polar bears from historical numbers, catalyzing divergent views on polar bear management. Lastly, should the duration of the ice-free season continue to increase, industrial shipping and future mining and oil and gas developments will affect polar bears in the region in ways that are not well understood.

Generating electricity by tapping tidal power proved to be very successful only in the last century through the tidal power plant constructed in 1967 in La Rance, France. This used a large barrier to generate the sea level head necessary for driving turbines. Construction of such plants evolved very slowly because of prohibitive costs and concerns about the environmental impact. Developments in the construction of small, efficient and inexpensive underwater turbines admit the possibility of small scale operations that will use local tidal currents to bring electricity to remote locations. Since the generation of such electricity is concerned with the tidal energy in local water bodies, it is important to understand the site-specific energy balance, i.e., the energy flowing in through open boundaries, and the energy generated and dissipated within the local domain. The question is how to tap the tidal energy while keeping possible changes in the present tidal regimes to a minimum. The older approach of constructing barrages may still be quite useful in some locations. The basics of such tidal power plants constructed in a small bay are analyzed in order to understand the principal parameter for tidal plant evaluation, i.e., the power produced.The new approach is to place turbines - devices similar to windmills - in the pathway of tidal currents. Theoretically, the amount of power available by such turbines for electricity generation is proportional to the water density and velocity cubed of the tidal flow. The naturally dissipated tidal power due to bottom friction forces is also proportional to the cube of the velocity. Because of this similarity, the exploitation of tidal energy can be directed to reinvesting the naturally dissipated power into tidal power for the generation of electricity. This approach to tidal power exploitation is better tuned towards preservation of the natural tidal regime.To answer the many questions related to tidal regime changes, it is important to develop a new branch of tidal dynamics which will help to better understand the interaction between a natural tidal regime and future changes caused by tapping into tidal energy.",,,,,,,,,15,0,0,0,10,0,18,,,0078-3234,2300-7370,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Alaska, Inst Marine Sci, Fairbanks, AK 99775 USA",,,,2004-01-01,WOS:000224237000001,,

Until recently, the lack of a reliable technique for long-term, in situ monitoring of activity has hindered study of seasonal variation in activity and its determinants. Electromagnetic telemetry has been used to measure seasonal changes in locomotor activity and body movements of lobsters on an artificial reef in Poole Bay, southern England. Both measures of activity showed marked seasonal variation, related primarily to water temperature, with greatest activity in late summer and minimum values in winter. Subsidiary effects of water movement and seabed illumination were also indicated. Throughout the spring and summer, excursions outside shelter were almost exclusively nocturnal, with movement peaking in the early part of the night. Body movements followed a similar pattern, but with less abrupt changes, suggesting a degree of activity within shelters during the day. Diel timing of lobster activity appeared to be mainly governed exogenously by light level, since the length of the nocturnal active period and the timing of the activity peak varied seasonally with the times of sunset and sunrise, and there was a relative increase in diurnal activity during periods of low seabed light levels caused by increased turbidity.

The current lack of data on dolphin population sizes or trends precludes impact assessments of developments on these protected species. Furthermore, the Western Australian and Commonwealth Government conservation listings of tropical inshore dolphins do not reflect their international listings. From April to July, 2010, we conducted ad hoc boat-based surveys (n=55) of inshore delphinids at seven sites across north-western Australia from Coral Bay in the south (23.1 degrees S: 113.8 degrees E) to Cable Beach in the north (17.9 degrees S: 122.2 degrees E). We documented the locations of these three species from which we obtained photo-identification and biopsy data, as well as reports of Australian Snubfin Dolphin sightings from researchers and community groups. The data from this limited field effort confirm that Indo-Pacific Humpback and Indo-Pacific Bottlenose Dolphins occur in the waters adjacent to each north-western Australian urban centre and show that the range of the Australian Snubfin Dolphin extends considerably further south-west than previously reported. Given the scale of coastal developments and the vulnerability of isolated cetacean populations to fragmentation or extirpation, assessments of the viability of dolphin populations are required.

The technical and legal work included consideration of the risks and benefits to the marine environment within the context of increasing atmospheric CO2 absorption by the oceans. The conclusion of this work was that the Conventions should move to remove their prohibitions that applied to certain CO2 geological storage project configurations, so as to facilitate and to regulate environmentally safe CO2 geological storage. In timescales faster than most anticipated, the London Protocol was amended in Novemeber 2006 and OSPAR was amended in June 2007. The actual amendments include various provisions, conditions and restrictions so as to only allow environmentally sound CO2 storage. These provisions and their implications for CCS regulation and projects are described in this paper. In this process, three detailed guidelines were produced for risk assessment and management of CO2 storage. These guidelines and their implications for CCS regulation and projects are described. Some key principles from the London and OSPAR CO2 developments are now being reflected in the European Commissions's proposed directive on geological storage of CO2. These marine conventions are good examples of evidence-based regulatory development in a new area, which brought together environmental, climate and energy experts and regulators, and key principles established by them will have wider implications for future CCS regulation and projects.

In this study, methane (CH4) fluxes and soil properties of the top 10 cm layer were determined in subtropical (Kandelia obovata) and tropical (Avicennia marina) mangrove ecosystems of Taiwan for a complete seasonal cycle. Our results demonstrate that CH4 emissions in mangroves cannot be neglected when constructing the carbon budgets and estimating the carbon storage capacity. CH4 fluxes were significantly higher in summer than in winter in the Avicennia mangroves. However, no seasonal variation in CH4 flux was observed in the Kandelia mangroves. CH4 fluxes were significantly higher in the mangrove soils of Avicennia than in the adjoining mudflats; this trend, however, was not necessarily recapitulated at Kandelia. The results of multiple regression analyses show that soil water and organic matter content were the main factors regulating the CH4 fluxes in the Kandelia mangroves. However, none of the soil parameters assessed show a significant influence on the CH4 fluxes in the Avicennia mangroves. Since pneumatophores can transport CH4 from anaerobic deep soils, this study suggests that the pneumatophores of Avicennia marina played a more important role than soil properties in affecting soil CH4 fluxes.

This process involves three basic stages: capture and compression of CO2 from power stations, transport of CO2, and storage away from the atmosphere for hundreds to thousands of years. Potential routes for the capture, transport and storage of CO2 from United Kingdom (UK) power plants are examined. Six indicative options are evaluated, based on 'Pulverised Coal', 'Natural Gas Combined Cycle', and 'Integrated (coal) Gasification Combined Cycle' power stations. Chemical and physical CO2 absorption capture techniques are employed with realistic transport possibilities to 'Enhanced Oil Recovery' sites or depleted gas fields in the North Sea. The selected options are quantitatively assessed against well-established economic and energy-related criteria. Results show that CO2 capture can reduce emissions by over 90%. However, this will reduce the efficiency of the power plants concerned, incurring energy penalties between 14 and 30% compared to reference plants without capture. Costs of capture, transport and storage are concatenated to show that the whole CCS chain 'cost of electricity' (COE) rises by 27-142% depending on the option adopted. This is a significant cost increase, although calculations show that the average 'cost of CO2 captured' is 15 pound/tCO(2) in 2005 prices [the current base year for official UK producer price indices'. If potential governmental carbon penalties were introduced at this level, then the COE would equate to the same as the reference plant, and make CCS a viable option to help mitigate large-scale climate change.

Deconvolving natural and anthropogenic changes to water quality is hampered by the lack of long term, dated water quality data but such records are required for forward modelling of reef health to aid their management. Reef corals provide an excellent archive of high resolution geochemical (trace element) proxies that can span hundreds of years and potentially provide records used through the Holocene. Hence, geochemical proxies in corals hold great promise for understanding changes in ancient water quality that can inform broader oceanographic and climatic changes in a given region. This article reviews and highlights the use of coral-based trace metal archives, including metal transported from rivers to the ocean, incorporation of trace metals into coral skeletons and the current 'state of the art' in utilizing coral trace meatl proxies as tools for monitoring various types of local and regional source-specific pollution ( river discharge, land use changes, dredging and dumping, mining, oil spills, antifouling paints, atmospheric sources, sewage). The three most commonly used coral trace element proxies (i.e., Ba/Ca, Mn/Ca, and Y/Ca) are closely associated with river runoff in the Great Barrier Reef, but considerable uncertainty remains regarding their complex biogeochemical cycling and controlling mechanisms. However, coral-based water quality reconstructions have suffered from a lack of understanding of so-called vital effects and early marine diagenesis. The main challenge is to identify and eliminate the influence of extraneous local factors in order to allow accurate water quality reconstructions and to develop alternate proxies to monitor water pollution. Rare earth elements have great potential as they are self-referencing and reflect basic terrestrial input. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Surprisingly, 37% were burned or melted, indicating a previously unreported source of ingested plastics (incinerated waste). We found no relationship between plastic ingestion and age, sex or body condition. By comparing our results with a similar nearby study, we illustrate the need for researchers to adopt standardized methods for plastic ingestion studies.

It is understood that commercial scale tidal power installations in the Minas Passage will result in an overall decrease in tidal amplitude in the Minas Basin. Corresponding changes in sedimentation patterns may or may not be within the natural range of variability, and it is hypothesized that intertidal sedimentation rates will demonstrate a non-linear response to modification of the tidal energy regime. This research considers acoustic Doppler velocimeter (ADV) and optical backscatter sensor (OBS) data from a sheltered tidal creek in the Minas Basin, for analysis of tidal characteristics in a hypertidal creek environment over spring and neap tidal cycles. Sediment deposition in the creek was also measured. Results show a first-order control of topography on flow magnitude in the tidal creek, which impacts net sediment deposition through resuspension and removal of newly introduced material. This study demonstrates that tides which peak around the bankfull level show reduced early ebb stage turbulence and flow velocity and encourage an extended depositional period. The dynamics of marshfull tides may be responsible for the maximum sediment deposition in tidal creeks, providing large amounts of material that is eventually distributed to and deposited on marsh surfaces.

This study is part of a larger project on the understanding of human factors in the design and implementation of automated drilling technology. The principal study was a longitudinal study lasting 4 years that involved 43 interviews, offshore and onshore observations, and two surveys. The analysis in this paper is based on seven informants who were either part of the design team or the paramount project team developing new automated drilling technology for an offshore oil- and gas-producing installation in the same development project, in addition to project documents. The informants were interviewed using semi-structured interviews, and grounded theory based on the coding process of Strauss and Corbin (Basics of qualitative research: grounded theory procedures and techniques. Sage, Newbury Park, 1990) was used to analyse the data. The core category was found to be insufficient human factor analyses performed in the development phase due to the two main categories, namely (1) insufficient information coordination and (2) narrow focus in different phases of the project. This was found to contribute to increased costs, low user-friendliness, and end users' insufficient knowledge of safe usage and potential risks. Our conclusion was that homogenous top competence involving technical aspects contributed to developers' lack of understanding of the need for sufficient analyses of end user requirements and of the tasks that would be affected by the new technology. Hence, we argue that technological development could benefit from including human factors experts from the project's outset to bridge the gap between the lack of relevant information and sufficient information on which to base development decisions. In addition, we contend that performing human factors analyses throughout the development of a project would be beneficial due to the potential of hindering cultural aspects such as a non-questioning culture, which is viewed as a hazard in high-risk organizations.",,,,,,,,,21,0,0,0,0,0,21,,,1435-5558,1435-5566,,,,,,,,,,"Nord Univ, Dept Educ Driving Instructors, N-7500 Stjordal, NorwayDNV GL, N-1322 Hovik, NorwayNorwegian Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Psychol, N-7491 Trondheim, Norway",,,,2016-08-01,WOS:000379539600009,,

The main objective is to facilitate the best possible flow of information between the companies in the oil and gas sector related to offshore upstream oil exploration and production activities. The LogisticsHub uses the EPCIS (Electronic Product Code Information Service) standard by GS1 for tracking events and for creating dashboard applications accessing the data. In the first version the focus is on tracking CCUs (cargo container units), while in the second version also the content of the containers will be tracked. The increased visibility enables enhanced performance of actors along the chain. In this paper we show how the overall complexity of multi-party information flows is reduced by the introduction of hubs, and how this contribute to improve performance of the supply chain as a whole and for each actor. Each actor in the supply chain generates tracking data into the LogisticsHub in a push fashion. The data enables the parties to evaluate their performance based on actual location data, and enhances the resilience of the supply chain.

With this in view, this study synthesizes the carbon source/sink due to net ecosystem productivity (NEP), land cover land use change (E-LUC), fires and fossil burning (E-FIRE) for the South Asia (SA), Southeast Asia (SEA) and South and Southeast Asia (SSEA = SA + SEA) and each country in these regions using the multiple top-down and bottom-up modeling results. The terrestrial net biome productivity (NBP = NEP - E-LUC - E-FIRE) calculated based on bottom-up models in combination with E-FIRE based on GFED4s data show net carbon sinks of 217 +/- 147, 10 +/- 55, and 227 +/- 279 TgC yr(-1) for SA, SEA, and SSEA. The top-down models estimated NBP net carbon sinks were 20 +/- 170, 4 +/- 90 and 24 +/- 180 TgC yr(-1). In comparison, regional emissions from the combustion of fossil fuels were 495, 275, and 770 TgC yr(-1), which are many times higher than the NBP sink estimates, suggesting that the contribution of the fossil fuel emissions to the carbon budget of SSEA results in a significant net carbon source during the 2000s. When considering both NBP and fossil fuel emissions for the individual countries within the regions, Bhutan and Laos were net carbon sinks and rest of the countries were net carbon source during the 2000s. The relative contributions of each of the fluxes (NBP, NEP, ELUC, and EFIRE, fossil fuel emissions) to a nation's net carbon flux varied greatly from country to country, suggesting a heterogeneous dominant carbon fluxes on the country-level throughout SSEA.",,,,,,,,,30,3,0,0,11,0,31,,,1748-9326,,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Illinois, Dept Atmospher Sci, Urbana, IL 61801 USAKarlsruhe Inst Technol, Inst Meteorol & Climate Res Atmospher Environm Re, Garmisch Partenkirchen, GermanyCSIRO Oceans & Atmosphere Flagship, Global Carbon Project, GPO Box 3023, Canberra, ACT 2601, AustraliaUniv Exeter, Coll Engn Math & Phys Sci, Exeter EX4 4QF, Devon, EnglandWoods Hole Res Ctr, 149 Woods Hole Rd, Falmouth, MA 02540 USAInst Appl Energy, Tokyo 1050003, JapanLawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Div Earth Sci, Berkeley, CA 94720 USAJAMSTEC, Dept Environm Geochem Cycle Res, Yokohama, Kanagawa 2360001, JapanMontana State Univ, Inst Ecosyst, Bozeman, MT 59717 USAMontana State Univ, Dept Ecol, Bozeman, MT 59717 USAUniv Exeter, Coll Life & Environm Sci, Exeter EX4 4RJ, Devon, EnglandImperial Coll, Dept Life Sci, Ascot SL5 7PY, Berks, EnglandCEA Saclay, Lab Sci Climat & Environm, F-91191 Gif Sur Yvette, FranceMet Off Hadley Ctr, Fitzroy Rd, Exeter EX1 3PB, Devon, EnglandUniv Maryland, Dept Atmospher & Ocean Sci, College Pk, MD 20742 USAUniv Maryland, Earth Syst Sci Interdisciplinary Ctr, College Pk, MD 20742 USA",Inst Appl Energy,,,2016-10-01,WOS:000386616600001,,

Emissions from oil/gas extraction are sources of air pollutants, but large uncertainties exist with regard to their amounts and composition. In this study, we focus on detailed investigation of emissions from oil/gas extraction in the Norwegian Sea combining measurements from the EU ACCESS aircraft campaign in July 2012 and regional chemical transport modeling. The goal is to (1) evaluate emissions from petroleum extraction activities and (2) investigate their impact on atmospheric composition over the Norwegian Sea. Numerical simulations include emissions for permanently operating offshore facilities from two datasets: the TNO-MACC inventory and emissions reported by Norwegian Environment Agency (NEA). It was necessary to additionally estimate primary aerosol emissions using reported emission factors since these emissions are not included in the inventories for our sites. Model runs with the TNO-MACC emissions are unable to reproduce observations close to the facilities. Runs using the NEA emissions more closely reproduce the observations although emissions from mobile facilities are missing from this inventory. Measured plumes suggest they are a significant source of pollutants, in particular NOx and aerosols. Sensitivities to NOx and NMVOC emissions show that, close to the platforms, O-3 is sensitive to NOx emissions and is much less sensitive to NMVOC emissions. O-3 destruction, via reaction with NO, dominates very close to the platforms. Far from the platforms, oil/gas facility emissions result in an average daytime O-3 enhancement of +2% at the surface. Larger enhancements are predicted at noon ranging from +7% at the surface to +15% at 600 m. Black carbon is the aerosol species most strongly influenced by petroleum extraction emissions. The results highlight significant uncertainties in emissions related to petroleum extraction emissions in the Arctic.",,,,,,,,,12,0,0,0,5,0,12,,,2325-1026,,,,,,,,,,,"Sorbonne Univ, UPMC Univ Paris 06, CNRS, LATMOS IPSL,UVSQ, Paris, FranceDeutsch Zentrum Luft & Raumfahrt DLR, Inst Phys Atmosphare, D-10 Oberpfaffenhofen, GermanyUniv Vienna, Fac Phys Aerosol Phys & Environm Phys, Boltzmanngasse 5, A-1090 Vienna, AustriaTNO Climate Air & Sustainabil, Princetonlaan 6, NL-3584 CB Utrecht, NetherlandsNUMTECH, CS 60242, 6 Allee Alan Turing, F-63178 Aubiere, FranceEcole Polytech, Lab Meteorol Dynam, F-91128 Palaiseau, FranceCtr Int Climate & Environm Res, Oslo, Norway",NUMTECHCtr Int Climate & Environm Res,,,2018-01-30,WOS:000403534200001,,

Reports of damage to ecosystem function have been reported, but the environmental effects of seismic exploration are largely undocumented. Key impacts in mangroves include tree removal and trampling. This paper reports on their effects in southeast Tanzania, through assessments of tree density and species distribution, incidence of local harvesting and changes in environmental conditions that might influence the biota. Seismic survey-related gaps in the canopy have not resulted in increases in mangrove recruitment, or affected microhabitat temperatures or salinity. However, seismic lines may have become access routes, leading to increased mangrove harvesting. There were few signs of recovery in the immediate vicinity of seismic lines, which appeared to be related to trampling effects on soil stability and changes in hydrology attributable to the loss of trees. Future research should target seedling and sapling abundance and growth rates, and soil structure, composition and nutrient levels. Recommended mitigation measures would involve the promotion of mangrove regeneration and the prevention of secondary impacts such as the use of lines as access routes, with monitoring of forest recovery.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,0856-860X,,,,,,,,,,,"eco2Diving, Marine Res and Educ Ctr, POB 784, Mtwara, Tanzania",,,,2011-03-18,BCI:BCI201100114921,,

J,,,,,,,,,Mike Clare,,Developing a Global Listening Network for Turbidity Currents and Seafloor Processes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Awarded Grant,Jun 30 2019,2019,"This ambitious project can make a major step-change in understanding of seafloor processes and geohazards by developing a listening network based on low-cost hydrophones (via acoustic noise in water column) and geophones (via ground shaking). This type of low-cost network has unusually widespread applications, but here we aim to answer fundamental questions about how submarine mass-flows (turbidity currents and landslides) are triggered, and then behave. These hazardous and often powerful (2-20 m/s) submarine events form the largest sediment accumulations, deepest canyons, and longest channel systems on our planet. Turbidity currents can runout for hundreds to thousands of kilometres, to break seabed cable networks that carry >95% of global data traffic, including the internet and financial markets, or strategic oil and gas pipelines. These flows play a globally important role in organic carbon and nutrient transfer to the deep ocean, and geochemical cycles; whilst their deposits host valuable oil and gas reserves worldwide. Submarine mass flows are notoriously difficult to measure in action, and there are very few measurements compared to their subaerial cousins. This means there are fundamental gaps in basic understanding about how submarine mass flows are triggered, their frequency and runout, and how they behave. Recent monitoring has made advances using power-hungry (active source) sensors, such as acoustic Doppler current profilers (ADCPs). But active-source sensors have major disadvantages, and cannot be deployed globally. They can only measure for short periods, are located on moorings anchored inside these powerful flows (which often carry the expensive mooring and sensors away), and they need multiple periods of expensive research vessels to be both deployed and recovered. We will therefore design, build and test passive sensors that can be deployed over widespread areas at far lower cost. These novel sensors will record mass-flow timing and triggers; and changes in front speed (from transit times), and flow power (via strength of acoustic or vibration signal).We will first determine how submarine mass flows are best recorded by hydrophones and geophones, and how that record varies with flow speed and type, or distance to sensor. Our preliminary work at three sites already shows that hydrophone and geophones do record mass-flows. Here we will determine the best way to capture that mass-flow signal, and to distinguish it from other processes. This will form the basis for then designing and field testing a new generation of low-cost smart sensors, which return data without expensive surface vessels; via pop-up floats and satellite links. Advances in technology make this project timely, as they allow on-board data processing by smart hydrophones to reduce data volumes, which can be triggered to record for short periods at much higher frequency. We will test the new smart sensors, and use them to answer two major science questions. First, do submarine flows in different settings show consistent modes of behaviour? Second, what triggers submarine flows in river-fed systems, and how are they linked to major river floods, earthquakes, and tropical cyclones? To do this, we will place these new sensors along the Congo Canyon (dilute river, passive margin, no cyclones) off West Africa, and the Gaoping Canyon (hyperpycnal river, active margin, frequent cyclones) offshore Taiwan.These sensors have other widespread applications. Low cost warning sensors would be a major advance for offshore hazard assessment, and leaks from CCS facilities or gas pipelines. Sensors that record landslides would be a step change for tsunami warning systems, or threats to valuable seabed infrastructure. This proposal is also particularly timely, because of advances in technology now allow on-board data processing and communication between smart sensors, which can be triggered to record for short periods at much higher frequency.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,NE/S009965/1,,,,,,,,National Oceanography Centre,National Oceanography Centre,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:15351618,,

The new discovered fauna indicates an Anisian-Lower Ladinian age for the Tejra section. Its lowermost part is considered as equivalent of Ouled Chebbi Formation, while the medium and upper parts are considered as equivalent of the Kirchaou Formation. Both sedimentological characteristics and fossil assemblages indicate the increasing marine influences within the middle part of the section and the migration of brackish and freshwater fauna into the lacustrine/playa environment at the top. The marine fauna-rich interval of the Tejra section correlates well with the well-known Myophoria-rich carbonate stratigraphic marker confirming the Middle Triassic (Ladinian) major transgression well recorded eastward in the Tunisian Jeffara basin and in Libya. The use of this Ladinian stratigraphic event in addition to the Carnian carbonate transgressive events of the Jeffara escarpment outcrops was of great help for regional lithostratigraphic correlations between the Triassic outcropping series and those currently buried in Ghadames and Berkine basins. The age of the sandstones of Trias Argilo-Greseux Inferieur (TAGI) which forms the main oil and gas reservoir in the Saharan domain is attributed to the Anisian-Carnian and considered as coeval of Ouled Chebbi and Kirchaou Formations of the Dahar escarpment.

Although remote from habitation, the polar ice sheets influence global sea level. Retreat by increased melting and iceberg calving produces higher sea levels and concerns exist that sea level may rise by metres displacing many millions of people, and their livelihoods, from their coastal homes. At this point in time, it is not possible to study the full life cycle of the present Antarctic or Greenland ice sheets as they are still evolving and undergoing large-scale changes. Instead, we will use an ice sheet that has now fully retreated; the ice sheet that covered most of Britain, Ireland and the North Sea during the last ice age. The last British-Irish ice sheet covered up to 1,000,000 km2 at its maximum size, around 25,000 yrs ago, and was relatively small by global standards. However, its character, setting and behaviour have striking parallels with both the modern West Antarctic and Greenland Ice Sheets. Large parts of the British-Irish Ice Sheet were marine-influenced just like in west Antarctica today; and numerous fast-flowing ice streams carried much of its mass, just like in the Greenland Ice Sheet today.

The main focus of the project therefore, is to collect sediments and rocks deposited by the last ice sheet that covered the British Isles, and use these, along with organic remains, to date (e.g. by radiocarbon analyses) the retreat of the ice sheet margins.

The main focus of the project therefore, is to collect sediments and rocks deposited by the last ice sheet that covered the British Isles, and use these, along with organic remains, to date (e.g. by radiocarbon analyses) the retreat of the ice sheet margins. The project will use over 200 carefully chosen sites, dating some 800 samples in order to achieve this. Offshore, samples will be extracted using coring devices lowered from a research ship to the seabed, and onshore by manual sampling and by use of small drilling rigs. Once the samples are dated and added to the pattern information provided by the landforms, maps of the shrinking ice sheet will be produced. These will provide crucial information on the timing and rates of change across the whole ice sheet. The British-Irish Ice Sheet will become the best constrained anywhere in the world and be the benchmark against which ice sheet models are improved and tested in the future.Knowledge on the character and age of the seafloor sediments surrounding the British Isles is also useful for many industrial, archaeological and heritage applications. Accordingly, the project is closely linked to partners interested, for example, in locating offshore windfarms, electricity cables between Britain and Ireland, and heritage bodies aiming to preserve offshore archaeological remains.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,NE/J007943/1,,,,,,,,Swansea University,,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:15320017,,
J,"Ferguson, Megan C.",,,,,,,,,,Quantifying spatial characteristics of the Bowhead Whale Aerial Survey Project (BWASP) survey design,,,,,,,,Journal of Cetacean Research and Management,,,,12,1,,,39,44,,,,,,,,,,,Article,2012,2012,"The Bowhead Whale Aerial Survey Project (BWASP) has been conducted annually since 1979 in the Alaskan Beaufort Sea to monitor the distribution and relative abundance of the Bering-Chukchi-Beaufort (BCB) stock of bowhead whales (Balaena mysticetus) during their autumn migration. BWASP was created to specifically address broad-scale research and management questions related to bowhead whale ecology, with particular interest in the potential effects of oil and natural gas exploration, development and production activities on the BCB bowhead whales. With elevated concerns about climate change, increasing oil and gas activities and the forecasted increase in vessel traffic, it is expected that interest in the BWASP dataset will also increase in order to evaluate effects of these anthropogenic activities on BCB bowhead whales and indigenous whaling. The following analysis quantified the spatial characteristics of the BWASP survey design and provided guidelines for the types of investigations that the BWASP data can potentially address. Sampling lags (transect spacing) in the BWASP survey design of approximately 20km along the east/west axis of the study area limit the spatial scale of phenomena that can be detected using data from a single BWASP survey. Therefore, BWASP data are relatively uninformative for studying variability in distribution or relative abundance along the east/west axis over short time scales (one survey) and within small areas measuring less than approximately 20km. In addition, computer simulations showed spatial heterogeneity in the long-term survey coverage probability (the probability that a given location will be included in a survey having an assumed effective search width under the BWASP survey design). Pooled transects created from simulated surveys resulted in a repeating diamond pattern in which coverage probability was low. Analyses incorporating data from many BWASP surveys should account for this spatial heterogeneity, via either the survey coverage probabilities or quantification of survey effort; otherwise estimates of variables such as relative density, density, or habitat use may be biased. The BWASP surveys have increased understanding of the broad-scale patterns of bowhead distribution, relative abundance and behaviour. The utility of this dataset in informing other questions will depend upon the scale of the ecological phenomena under investigation and the analytical scales used to address the questions.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,1561-0713,,,,,,,,,,,"NOAA Fisheries, Natl Marine Mammal Lab, Alaska Fisheries Sci Ctr, 7600 Sand Point Way NE,F-AKC3, Seattle, WA 98115 USA",,,,2012-01-01,BCI:BCI201400062355,,

The erosion of its subaqueous delta in recent decades has been ascribed to a decline in fluvial sediment input. However, the interaction between the reduction of riverine sediment load and human activities in the estuary that could have caused morphological change has not been considered. In this work we provide evidence on the morphological evolution around the delta front zone since 1986 and use a numerical model to explore the correlation between the change in hydrodynamics and the evolution pattern. Bathymetric data analysis suggests a decrease of net accretion rate from 16.7 mm/year (1986-1997) to 9.1 mm/year (1997-2010) in the study area. Spatially, the tidal flats accreted whereas the subaqueous delta switched from deposition between 1986 and 1997 to erosion between 1997 and 2010. We used two indicators, tidal energy dissipation and erosion rate, to quantify the change in hydrodynamics and found that the erosion of the subaqueous delta in recent decades can readily be explained by the alteration of the hydrodynamics. The newly built navigation training works in the North Passage had a significant effect on the estuarine hydrodynamics, resulting in a local morphological adjustment This erosion generated a new source of sediments to maintain the high suspended sediment concentration and tidal flat progradation. The erosion of the subaqueous delta may continue and gradually slow down until the altered hydrodynamics and morphology reach an equilibrium state in the future. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

The relationship between d/t and limited internal pressure is obtained by finite element analysis and nonlinear regression. Through an advanced first-order reliability method (HL-RF) algorithm, reliability analysis is performed to obtain the failure probability, the reliability index and the sensitivity.

Accessibility is important in determining whether an invasive species can be controlled/eradicated. In the marine environment, depth limits accessibility. We assessed the depth distribution of T. micranthus and T. coccinea on 15 oil/gas platforms using remotely operated vehicles (ROVs). Pooled data indicated that T. micranthus extends to 138 m and probably deeper, while T. coccinea is generally limited to <=78 m. Average depths for T. micranthus were shallower west of the Mississippi River, in its plume, and deeper towards the east. Tubastraea coccinea exhibited a similar geographic depth-distribution pattern, but shallower and subtler. Broad geographic patterns were similar whether using density or percent-cover data for analysis. When considering individual platforms, T. micranthus often reached the bottom and sometimes occurred at depths >=138 m. Tubastraea coccinea were limited to shallow waters on all platforms. Detailed depth distribution patterns varied significantly between analyses using density and percent-cover data, with density probably indicating colonization rates, and percent-cover colony growth. Depth limitation by T. coccinea may be associated with food availability rather than light since it is azooxanthellate.

First, there is a risk to the substance itself, the carbon dioxide stream. In addition, there is a problem of risk management for leakage of carbon dioxide stream in the process of collection, transport and storage and operation after storage. In other words, risk management due to CCS is an area where the complex factors such as the risk of the material itself, the risk of facility management, and the risk of the geographical characteristics of the area where the facility is located are overlapped. Therefore, it would be unreasonable to apply the existing risk / treatment standards in determining the risk management method for carbon dioxide streams.The purpose of storing and storing the carbon dioxide stream is not because of the high risk or difficulty of the material itself, such as radioactive waste, but because there is a separate policy purpose of collecting and storing the material in order to reduce the greenhouse gas. Therefore, rather than approaching the risk management of the material by defining the carbon dioxide stream as a simple pollutant or waste, it is assumed that the carbon dioxide stream should be collected and stored according to the purpose of the CCS. Although it is facility-based risk management, it is impossible to analyze and respond to various risks related to the installation and operation of CCS storage facilities. It is also necessary to appropriately disperse the relevant risk management by means and methods according to each statute.Risk assessment of substances, risk management of facilities to store and store them, as well as risk communication, are easy to overlook, but it is very important. The risk to the substance itself, the carbon dioxide stream, and the absence of geological information on the location of the facility to store the substance will inevitably create anxiety for the locals. In Europe, which is judged to be a preemptive response to CCS in legal terms, it is difficult to select the location of CCS facilities.

Stratigraphic studies of sediments collected from intertidal areas show the presence of a distinct stratigraphic horizon in the northeast of Pagham Harbour at ca, 0 to + 1.0 m ordnance datum (OD). Radiometric data indicate that this horizon is a 'reclamation surface' formed after land claim in AD 1846. Following marine flooding in AD 1910, sediment has accreted relatively rapidly (at a broadly constant rate of between 4 and 8 nun a(-1)), wave and/or tidal energy have decreased and extensive marshes have developed. An asymptotic reduction in sediment accretion rate through time, as predicted in various theoretical models of salt marsh accretion, is not observed. Over the entire Pagham Harbour area, the period between AD 1948 and AD 1986 has seen an average marsh loss of 0.0087 km(2) a(-1), which is relatively small in comparison with other more exposed sites in the local area. Historically breached sites such as Pagham Harbour are common around European coasts, and these provide important natural laboratories within which the medium-term (decadal to centennial) coastal response to barrier breaching, and to managed-realignment coastal protection schemes, can be assessed.

Also, the comprehensive performance of the JCSM is improved by optimizing the details of the topological structure. Therefore, the JCSM is well-suited for either wet tree or dry tree developments in harsh environments. Meanwhile, it possesses a variety of attractive functions covering drilling, early production, workover, oil and gas treatment, oil storage and unloading, and etc. Thus, a JCSM can be used throughout the entire life cycle of deepwater oil and gas field development, which can greatly help reduce the capex and opex and obtain higher economic benefit.

Reduction of CO2 to a sustainable level is required to avoid further marine change. Many studies investigate the potential of marine carbon sinks (e.g. seagrass) to mitigate anthropogenic emissions, however, information on storage by coralline algae and the beds they create is scant. Calcifying photosynthetic organisms, including coralline algae, can act as a CO2 sink via photosynthesis and CaCO3 dissolution and act as a CO2 source during respiration and CaCO3 production on short-term timescales. Longterm carbon storage potential might come from the accumulation of coralline algae deposits over geological timescales. Here, the carbon storage potential of coralline algae is assessed using meta-analysis of their global organic and inorganic carbon production and the processes involved in this metabolism. Net organic and inorganic production were estimated at 330 g C m(-2) yr(-1) and 900 g CaCO3 m(-2) yr(-1) respectively giving global organic/inorganic C production of 0.7/1.8 x 10(9) t C yr(-1). Calcium carbonate production by free-living/crustose coralline algae (CCA) corresponded to a sediment accretion of 70/450 mm ky r(-1). Using this potential carbon storage for coralline algae, the global production of free-living algae/CCA was 0.4/1.2 x 10(9) t C yr(-1) suggesting a total potential carbon sink of 1.6 x 10(9) tonnes per year. Coralline algae therefore have production rates similar to mangroves, salt marshes and seagrasses representing an as yet unquantified but significant carbon store, however, further empirical investigations are needed to determine the dynamics and stability of that store.",,,,,,,,,80,3,0,0,65,1,83,,,1726-4170,1726-4189,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Glasgow, Sch Geog & Earth Sci, Glasgow, Lanark, ScotlandUniv Utrecht, Fac Geosci, Dept Earth Sci, Utrecht, Netherlands",,,,2015-01-01,WOS:000365091900011,,

Chemical substitution, as part of the environmental regulatory regime, has been advocated as a simple and effective tool to reduce inputs of hazardous substances to the environment. In 2007 the UK National Plan was introduced, to prioritise into four groups and subsequently phase out in stages the most hazardous substances used and discharged during offshore oil and gas operations. Level 1 substances categorised for phase out in 2010 were virtually eliminated from discharge between 2006 and 2012 and there was a significant decline in discharge of substances at Level 2 to 4 over the same period. The discharge of substitutable substances had been reduced to less than 5 tonnes at most production installations by 2012. More than 91% of this discharge is contributed by corrosion inhibitor, scale inhibitor, demulsifier and water clarifier formulations. The discharge of corrosion inhibitors accounted for the largest contribution to UK National Plan Level 2 substitutable substance discharges, and they appear to be the type of product with the fewest options found for substitution. This implies that a finite discharge of substances from these groups will continue to require formal justification beyond the target date, as occurred for Level 1 substances after the 2010 target date. The overall figures for substitutable substance discharges from 2006 to 2012 suggest that the introduction of the UK National plan with prioritisation of substances for substitution and ongoing encouragement of operators and, indirectly, suppliers to work towards reduction goals for substitutable substances is resulting in a reduction in discharges and contributing to their ultimate phase out. The next few years will be particularly challenging as the deadline for the phase-out of discharges of substitutable substances included in OSPAR Recommendation, 2006/3 is 1 January 2017 and, in addition, by 2018 all chemical substances used offshore will need to have been registered under the EC REACH Regulation. The approach described in this paper illustrates the benefits of a prioritised strategy for chemical substitution and an ongoing dialogue between the industry and regulator. A continuing case by case dialogue with offshore operators and suppliers will be essential to ensure that alternative technical solutions are trialled and options for substitution are investigated at the earliest stage.

System availability is assessed considering the equivalent age of the components to account for the impacts of harsh operating conditions on component life history and maintenance duration.

We find that contrary to recent speculations that changes in terrestrial carbon storage were primarily responsible for the observed similar to20 ppmv late Holocene CO2 rise, a more likely explanation is coral reef buildup and other forms of shallow water carbonate deposition during this time. The importance of a responsive terrestrial carbon reservoir may instead be as a negative feedback restricting the rate of CO2 rise possible in the early stages of the deglacial transition. This separation in time of the primary impacts of regrowth of the terrestrial biosphere and increased shallow water carbonate deposition explains the occurrence of an early Holocene carbonate preservation event observed in deep-sea sediments. We demonstrate that their combined influence is also consistent with available proxy estimates of deep ocean carbonate ion concentration changes over the last 21 kyr. Accounting for the processes that act on the carbonate chemistry of the ocean as a whole then allows us to place strong constraints on the nature of the remaining processes that must be operating at the deglacial transition. By subtracting the net CO2 effect of coral reef buildup and terrestrial biosphere regrowth from recent high-resolution ice core data, we highlight two periods, from 17.0 to 13.8 kyr and 12.3 to 11.2 kyr BP characterized by sustained rapid rates of CO2 increase (> 12 ppmv kyr(-1)). Because these periods are coincident with Southern Hemisphere deglaciation,'' we argue that changes in the biogeochemical properties of the Southern Ocean surface are the most likely cause.",,,,,,,,,87,2,0,0,16,0,92,,,0883-8305,1944-9186,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Calif Riverside, Dept Earth Sci, Riverside, CA 92521 USAUniv E Anglia, Sch Environm Sci, Norwich NR4 7TJ, Norfolk, EnglandUCL, Dept Geog, Environm Change Res Ctr, London WC1H 0AP, EnglandMax Planck Inst Biogeochem, D-07745 Jena, Germany",,,,2003-10-18,WOS:000186091000001,,

In this paper, we review the current practices of pipeline decommissioning in different regions of the world and then highlight issues and challenges related to such activities in deep and ultra-deep waters. These issues and challenges can be broadly categorised into technical (e.g., selection of appropriate decommissioning procedures for handling hazardous pipelines), financial or economic, health and safety legislation, environmental, and human or organisational issues (such as lack of requisite skills, knowledge and expertise).

Should an incident arise, the OIM performs one of the most critical roles within the offshore industry - management of the response to the emergency to mitigate and make safe the installation to secure a place of safety for persons onboard or organise their safe evacuation. The emergency response also includes limiting the loss of hydrocarbons to the environment.Research at the University of Aberdeen has identified 8 potential barriers to the effective competence assessment of OIMs in controlling emergencies. These underlying barriers are a consequence of current UK legislation and industry practices in the assessment of OIM competence and result from:multiple definitions of competence,competence assessment predominantly by observation,lack of specific and unambiguous competence requirements for trainers and assessors,complexity in UK legislation and complicated interpretation of terms,lack of statutory competence requirements for OIMs in controlling emergencies,lack of ownership of OIM competence and competence assessment,complex interactions across multiple UK Government departments, andlack of regulation and independent audit of the competence assessment process of OIMs in controlling emergencies.The potential barriers were identified by qualitative analysis of key documentation, including legislation, using a critical hermeneutic approach. Hermeneutics has historically been used to analyse texts within the domains of theology, business and law. It arguably, however, represents a powerful approach to the study of documents within the engineering domain and the offshore oil and gas industry.This paper discusses the identified potential barriers, research conclusions and recommendations and represents the culmination of three years of doctoral research investigating the competence assessment of OIMs in controlling emergencies within the offshore oil and gas industry.

However, little is known regarding the effects of simultaneous ocean warming, acidification and eutrophication on these capacities. In this study, Ulva rigida was cultivated under two levels of: temperature (14 degrees C (LT) and 18 degrees C (HT)); pH (8.10 and 7.70) by controlling pCO(2) (LC, HC respectively); and nutrients (low (LN) - 50m N and 2.5m P and high (HN) - 1000m N and 50m P) for 6weeks. During the first week of cultivation, HT, HC and HN increased biomass by 38.1%, 17.1% and 20.8%, respectively, while the higher temperature led to negative growth in weeks 2, 4 and 6 due to reproductive events. By the end of the cultivation, biomass under HTHCHN was 130.4% higher than the control (LTLCLN), contributing to a higher carbon capture capacity. Although the thalli at HT released nutrients to seawater in weeks 2, 4 and 6, the HTHCHN treatment increased the overall nitrate uptake rate over the cultivation period by 489.0%. The HTHCHN treatment also had an increased biochemical methane potential and methane yield (47.3% and 254.6%, respectively).

Sleepiness was measured twice a day (morning and evening) with the Karolinska Sleepiness Scale. Changes in sleep and sleepiness parameters during the pre/post and offshore work periods were investigated using (generalized) linear mixed models. In the pre-offshore work period, courses of SE% significantly decreased (p=.038).

A model based on Dynamic Bayesian Network (DBN) is developed to assess the ecological risk posed to the aquatic community.

Both reports conclude that early action is vital to stabilize greenhouse gases that are responsible for global warming. Carbon dioxide (CO2) accounts for 84% of all greenhouse gases emissions so makes it the obvious choice when considering which gas to target first.The solution to this problem is very challenging, as we need to make sure that we protect the planet and continue to enjoy a high standard of living without ruining our economy and potentially leading to an energy famine. One possibility is to capture carbon dioxide as it is produced and prevent it from reaching the atmosphere by storing it underground. This idea is the subject of this proposal.Although there are already some large scale CO2 storage projects (e.g. Sleipner in the North Sea and Weyburn between Canada and USA) they are principally due to the extraction of oil and gas and are, therefore, highly site specific. They do not address the broader issue of capturing and storing CO2 from fossil fuelled power plants / the largest contributors of anthropogenic CO2 emissions in the UK and worldwide.The major and most contentious technological barrier for the wide deployment of capture and storage technologies is integrity, as policy, regulatory and public acceptability of CCS will demand storage sites to be permanent safe repositories without leaks. Research at the interface between science and engineering and international cooperation will accelerate the technological innovation needed for ensuring the integrity of storage sites and lead to a widespread deployment of carbon capture and storage. This proposal focuses on developing a Centre for Innovation in Capture and Storage that will promote interdisciplinary activity to bring groundbreaking ideas from basic science and develop them into new products, processes and services, as well as consider public acceptability issues. Within the Centre we will train scientists and engineers with a broad and interdisciplinary set of skills suitable for their future careers in industry, research or government. The research undertaken by these scientists and engineers will be identified and inspired by a range of initiatives that will bring to the Centre a range of people including those from industry, different research areas, environmentalists and policy makers. The outcome of this research, and general awareness raising of issues around carbon capture and storage, will then be promoted. In summary, the overall aim of the Centre will be to develop a holistic view to the development of carbon capture and storage with the aim of making a significant impact in finding solutions for climate change and protecting the planet.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,EP/F012098/2,,,,,,,,Heriot-Watt University,,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:15405969,,

Unfortunately, there is a lack of qualitative and quantitative published data in the Gulf of Guinea, where biological fouling has a significant impact on cost of structural inspection and maintenance because of the importance of colonization due to favorable environmental parameters (warmer temperature of seawater intense action of the waves generating a mixing of the nutritive elements, strong light, etc.).

The UK and Scottish Governments have set ambitious targets for power generation from renewable sources: 50% of electricity is to be generated from renewable sources in Scotland, and 15% of the UK's total energy consumption is to be from renewable sources by 2020. The UK has one of the richest wave & tidal energy resources in the world and is at the forefront of researching, developing & deploying this technology in challenging & energetic ocean environments. The industry's success depends on the natural environment (waves & tides), but often how wave & tidal energy devices interact with the environment is not well understood. Through decades of research UK scientists have gained substantial knowledge about our seas and a wealth of experience & data that could be translated and applied in support of sustainable wave and tidal energy generation. This project will create a common language between the UK research community and companies developing technology to harness ocean energy, and in doing so will support collaboration and information exchange between these groups, and with the UK government and industry regulators, to help maintain the ongoing growth of the industry.While the UK is at the forefront of marine renewable energy development, the production of energy from the ocean is by no means limited to the UK. Indeed projects are being developed on almost every continent around the world which could be accessed by UK companies looking to develop overseas. Likewise, many international companies are interested in developing in the UK. Attracted by the UK's leading position in the field and our wealth of natural resources, some international developers have already secured a place at the wave and tidal energy device testing centres at EMEC on Orkney, and at Wave Hub in Cornwall. Many of the greatest challenges facing such developers, whether in the UK or abroad, is in understanding and managing the interaction of the devices with the environment. During this project the fellow will highlight worldwide hotspots for marine renewable energy development and identifying common environmental challenges around the world. A key objective is to identify, translate and apply world leading UK environmental research to help tackle these common challenges. This Fellowship will signpost international business to applicable UK research and help UK researchers form productive industry collaborations to increase the impact and uptake of their work. The project will highlight relevant research outputs in key challenge areas and summarize these in a series of Bulletins. These Bulletins will be made widely available and targeted to businesses and policy makers in order to increase environmental understanding and therefore reduce risk and costs to businesses associated with tackling environmental challenges. It is anticipated that this approach will encourage financial investment from the industry into the UK, and will give confidence to British companies looking to grow and develop overseas.Academic input into the wave and tidal energy industries can help to reduce the environmental risks associated with many developments in the UK. Subsequently, by reducing the cost of environmental impact assessments and uncertainty around the extreme offshore environments where these projects are situated, confidence in the sustainability of the sector will increase. This will undoubtedly encourage further investment, both from the UK and from abroad, often into the rural or remote coastal locations where the energy resource is greatest. The support and networking provided throughout this project can therefore help to create jobs and spark regeneration in these areas while sustaining an economically strong, world-leading marine renewable energy sector.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,NE/M006999/1,,,,,,,,Scottish Association For Marine Science,Scottish Association For Marine Science,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:15382854,,

Both reports conclude that early action is vital to stabilize greenhouse gases that are responsible for global warming. Carbon dioxide (CO2) accounts for 84% of all greenhouse gases emissions so makes it the obvious choice when considering which gas to target first.The solution to this problem is very challenging, as we need to make sure that we protect the planet and continue to enjoy a high standard of living without ruining our economy and potentially leading to an energy famine. One possibility is to capture carbon dioxide as it is produced and prevent it from reaching the atmosphere by storing it underground. This idea is the subject of this proposal.Although there are already some large scale CO2 storage projects (e.g. Sleipner in the North Sea and Weyburn between Canada and USA) they are principally due to the extraction of oil and gas and are, therefore, highly site specific. They do not address the broader issue of capturing and storing CO2 from fossil fuelled power plants / the largest contributors of anthropogenic CO2 emissions in the UK and worldwide.The major and most contentious technological barrier for the wide deployment of capture and storage technologies is integrity, as policy, regulatory and public acceptability of CCS will demand storage sites to be permanent safe repositories without leaks. Research at the interface between science and engineering and international cooperation will accelerate the technological innovation needed for ensuring the integrity of storage sites and lead to a widespread deployment of carbon capture and storage. This proposal focuses on developing a Centre for Innovation in Capture and Storage that will promote interdisciplinary activity to bring groundbreaking ideas from basic science and develop them into new products, processes and services, as well as consider public acceptability issues. Within the Centre we will train scientists and engineers with a broad and interdisciplinary set of skills suitable for their future careers in industry, research or government. The research undertaken by these scientists and engineers will be identified and inspired by a range of initiatives that will bring to the Centre a range of people including those from industry, different research areas, environmentalists and policy makers. The outcome of this research, and general awareness raising of issues around carbon capture and storage, will then be promoted. In summary, the overall aim of the Centre will be to develop a holistic view to the development of carbon capture and storage with the aim of making a significant impact in finding solutions for climate change and protecting the planet.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,EP/F012098/1,,,,,,,,University of Nottingham,,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:15370806,,

To gain a better understanding of the influence of chemical processes affecting metal distribution in sediments as a result of the monsoon, the distribution of the metals in chemical fractionations of the sediment were also determined. The mean concentrations of total metals studied were considered low compared to crustal value and regional studies. The metal distribution is related to input from a number of rivers entering the study area. All metals studied (Al, Cr, Fe, Mn, Ni, Pb and Zn) and their chemical fractions were mostly higher in concentrations in the coastal sediments off Kuantan port, in the northern sector of the study area. This is possibly due to the runoff of metal contaminants from land through the Kuantan River estuary area which was a highly built up area, with oil and gas industries, a port and urban areas. In the southern sector of the study area, the relatively high concentrations of metals may originate from run-off from the Rompin River estuary and also from large coastal aquaculture activities in the Nenasi area. The monsoon was clearly seen to have some effect on metal distribution within the chemical fractions, because the proportion of metals increased in the bio-available fraction in sediments collected after the North-east monsoon. After the NE monsoon, a large reduction in enrichment factor (EF) values were found for Pb and Zn in the sediment throughout the study area suggesting that these metals were diluted and/or redistributed within the sedimentary environment. It is thought that input of fresh clean sediment from monsoon run-off via Pahang, Kuantan, Bebar, Merchong and Rompin rivers dilutes the metal contents in the Pahang coastal sediments. Alternatively or together with dilution, the sediments are redistributed and mixed resulting in overall dilution of metal concentrations. Metal fractionations patterns were significantly different between pre-and post-NE monsoon sediments, especially in exchangeable-Fe-Mn oxide, carbonate-Fe-Mn oxide and carbonate-residual fractions. This study shows that the Northeast Monsoon has the effect of redistributing the sediments as well as affecting the distribution of metals within the different chemical fractions of sediment.",,,,,OCEANS MTS/IEEE ConferenceOCEANS MTS/IEEE Conference,"MAY 21-24, 2012MAY 21-24, 2012",Marine Technol Soc; IEEE; IEEE Ocean Engn Soc; Korean Assoc Ocean Sci & Technol Soc (KAOSTS)Marine Technol Soc; IEEE; IEEE Ocean Engn Soc; Korean Assoc Ocean Sci & Technol Soc (KAOSTS),"Yeosu, SOUTH KOREAYeosu, SOUTH KOREA",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,0197-7385,,978-1-4577-2091-8,,,,,,,,,"Univ Malaysia Terengganu, Fac Maritime Studies & Marine Sci, Dept Marine Sci, Inst Oceanog INOS, Kuala Terengganu 21030, MalaysiaInt Islamic Univ Malaysia, Inst Oceanog & Marine Studies, Kuantan 25200, Malaysia",,,,2012-11-19,WOS:000309461400018,,

This predictability gives tidal energy additional value in a future electricity market. Especially one where stochastic renewable technologies contribute to a sizable component of the power supplied; and where reserve capacity is required to maintain supply during periods of non-availability. In the shorter term, in order for tidal energy to gain commercial acceptance, tidal technologies under development need to produce electricity at a competitive price.

Rarely is this information readily available, making it difficult to determine the applicability of realistic models to quantify population-level risks. To evaluate the trade-offs between data demands and increased specificity of spatially explicit models for population-level risk assessments, we developed a model for a standard toxicity test species, the sheepshead minnow (Cyprinodon variegatus), exposed to oil contamination following the Deepwater Horizon oil spill and compared the output with various levels of model complexity to a standard risk quotient approach. The model uses habitat and fish occupancy data collected over five sampling periods throughout 2008-2010 in Pensacola and Choctawhatchee Bays, Florida, USA, to predict species distribution, field-collected and publically available data on oil distribution and concentration, and chronic toxicity data from laboratory assays applied to a matrix population model. The habitat suitability model established distribution of fish within Barataria Bay, Louisiana, USA, and the population model projected the dynamics of the species in the study area over a 5-yr period (October 2009-September 2014). Vital rates were modified according to estimated contaminant concentrations to simulate oil exposure effects. To evaluate the differences in levels of model complexity, simulations varied from temporally and spatially explicit, including seasonal variation and location-specific oiling, to simple interpretations of a risk quotient derived for the study area. The results of this study indicate that species distribution, as well as spatially and temporally variable contaminant concentrations, can provide a more ecologically relevant evaluation of species recovery from catastrophic environmental impacts but might not be cost-effective or efficient for rapid assessment needs.",,,,,,,,,3,0,0,0,2,0,3,,,1051-0761,1939-5582,,,,,,,,,,"US EPA, Gulf Ecol Div, 1 Sabine Isl Dr, Gulf Breeze, FL 32561 USA",,,,2016-10-12,WOS:000383358000009,27755711,
J,,,,,,,,,"Ivanova,Elena",,Pliocene-Quaternary contourites in the Central and South Atlantic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Awarded Grant,Jan 01 1800,2018,"This project aimes the multidisciplinary research of specific deep-water sedimentary bedforms on the ocean floor and a certain genetic type of sediments composing them, designated as contourites. This type of sediments is formed under influence of the bottom water circulation. Depositional contourite bodies on the ocean floor (from mesoscale sedimentary waves to giant drifts) together with associated erosional channels and furrows are combined into contourite systems. The contourite systems are found in all oceans. They are variable in their morphology and sediment composition, but interrelated by uniform generation by bottom currents forcing. However, they occur most frequently in the Anlantic Ocean. This project is based on original primary materials (high-resolution seismic profiles, sediment cores etc.) collected in ten marine expeditions of the Shirshov Institute of Oceanology, RAS, mainly from the Central and Southwestern Atlantic. Additional marine expeditions are proposed during the project fulfilling). Contourite systems within the study area of the project that includes the submeridional belt from 11N (Vema Transform Fault) to 48 S (terraces on the Patagonian continental slope), aside from exclusive economic zones of South American states, are acting upon the influence of various water masses. Cold and dense Antarctic Bottom Water (AABW) generated in the Weddell Sea and detected in the bottom layer of the water column in all abyssal basins within the study area, are flowing northward at depths more than 3.5-4 km. Northward flowing AABW forms on its way contourite drifts and extensive fields of sedimentary waves distributed along the continental rise of Argentine and Brazil basins as well as within adjacent pelagic (or hemipelagic) areas. Studies planned in the frame of the project include analyses of both previously obtained data and those collected in future expeditions in order to reconstruct paleoceanological and paleoclimatological environments of the contourite systems formation and development in the geological past. In some cases (e.g. the Ioffe Drift) the history of system formation will be reconstructed since the Late Pliocene. The results allow us to start solution of the reverse task: reconstruction of variations in the AABW production and flow through the Vema channel and northern abyssal passages into the North Atlantic basins during several million years. Contourite systems at shallower depths are bathed (and affected) either by North Atlantic Deep Water (NADW) moving southward, as it takes place on the summit of the Ceara Rise, or by Circumpolar Antarctic water masses as on the erosion-depositional terraces of the Patagonian continental slope (with shallower depths up to 600 m). This area will be studied during fulfilling the project. Studies of alternating sandy glauconitic and biogenic calcareous contourites allow us to reconstruct variations in intensity of these currents, as well as activity of gravity flows via submarine canyons depending on glacio-eustatic sea level oscillations during two last glacial/interglacial cycles. During fulfilling the project, a specal attention will be paid to mechanisms of the contourite systems formation within various paleoceanological environments of continental margins and pelagic realm. Comparative analysis of contourite properties from different climatic zones with various terrigenous material delivery and biological productivity will be performed. The results obtained will be used for paleo-reconstructions by sediment cores, as well as by deep sea drilling boreholes. Using open data bases and own measurements, we intend to study the behavior of the near-bottom nepheloid layer in contourite systems formation. Development of a new system of views and theoretical approaches in investigation of contourites named contourite paradigm, in many scientific centres of the World shows actuality of the presented project topics. Solution of insufficiently understood problems of contourites distribution patterns, composition, and formation have to take a necessary position in the Russian palaeoceanological researches in the beginning of the 21th century. This is important owing to assumed oil and gas bearing potential of ancient contourite-type sedimentary bodies for survey of which the contourite systems studied during fulfilling the project may serve as actualistic facial models. Multidisciplinarity of the proposed research aimed to maximal possible results in existing real conditions, represents a principally new approach in order to recover the essence of contourites, as a single genetic type of Atlantic deep sea sediments with their considerable variability. The set of modern methods proposed for the contourites study during fulfilling the project has not been previously used in investigation of the same individual objects from the Southwestern Atlantic. The research team of the project first elaborated the method for direct correlation of the high resolution seismoacoustic profiles with sediment core and deep sea drilling borehole sections exactly located at the profiles. This provides a possibility to interpret the seismic facies by lithological and micropaleontological data. Based on already existing and newly obtained seismic data, results of lithological and micropaleontological research, a detailed description of the unique biogenic calcareous Ioffe Drift discovered in 2010 by RV Akademic Ioffe will compiled. Elaboration of a new, internally not contradictive hypothesis of the drift formation upon the influence of AABW outflow from the Vema Channel, since the Late Pliocene to present, is planned. It is also planned to perform a comparative analysis of contourites from the Ceara Rise and continental margin of Brazil, Uruguay and Argentine according to differences in terrigenous sediment supply, biological productivity, AABW flow structure and velocity. For the first time, abyssal contourite systems distinguished along the transatlantic geotraverse will be considered as elements of one super-system (or complex) controlled by movement of AABW from the Southern Ocean to the North Atlantic.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,18-17-00227,,,,,,,,P.P.Shirshov Institute of Оceanology of Russian Academy of Science,P.P.Shirshov Institute of Оceanology of Russian Academy of Science,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:15294910,,

Prior to human development, important areas of habitat should be identified to help managers minimize adverse effects. Resource selection functions can help identify these areas by providing a link between space use and landscape attributes. We estimated resource selection during five summer periods at two spatial scales for the Teshekpuk Caribou Herd in northern Alaska prior to industrial development to identify areas of high predicted use for the herd. Additionally, given the strong influence parturition and insect harassment have on space use, we determined how selection differed between parturient and non-parturient females, and between periods with and without insect harassment. We used location data acquired between 2004-2010 for 41 female caribou to estimate resource selection functions. Patterns of selection varied through summer but caribou consistently avoided patches of flooded vegetation and selected areas with a high density of sedge-grass meadow. Predicted use by parturient females during calving was almost entirely restricted to the area surrounding Teshekpuk Lake presumably due to high concentration of sedge-grass meadows, whereas selection for this area by non-parturient females was less strong. When insect harassment was low, caribou primarily selected the areas around Teshekpuk Lake but when it was high, caribou used areas having climates where insect abundance would be lower (i.e., coastal margins, gravel bars). Areas with a high probability of use were predominately restricted to the area surrounding Teshekpuk Lake except during late summer when high use areas were less aggregated because of more general patterns of resource selection. Planning is currently underway for establishing where oil and gas development can occur in the herd's range, so our results provide land managers with information that can help predict and minimize impacts of development on the herd.",,,,,,,,,25,0,0,0,24,0,28,,,1932-6203,,,,,,,,,,,"Wilderness Soc, Anchorage, AK USAABR Inc, Environm Res & Serv, Fairbanks, AK USAAlaska Dept Fish & Game, Fairbanks, AK USAN Slope Borough Dept Wildlife Management, Barrow, AK USAAlaska Dept Fish & Game, Barrow, AK USAAudubon Alaska, Anchorage, AK USAConocoPhillips Alaska Inc, Anchorage, AK USAUS Bur Land Management, Fairbanks, AK USA",Wilderness SocABR IncN Slope Borough Dept Wildlife ManagementAudubon AlaskaUS Bur Land Management,,,2012-11-05,WOS:000310741400059,23144932,

Barriers to migrating sea lampreys in tributaries can significantly reduce the spawning potential of sea lamprey in the Great Lakes. These barriers can be any natural or man-made structure that restricts the access of migrating sea lampreys to spawning habitat in streams. During the past four decades, the GLFC recognized a greater need to maintain current barriers to sea lamprey spawning migration and develop new, less intrusive devices to enhance the integrated sea lamprey control program. The standard sea lamprey barrier uses a fixed-crest height and overhanging lip to maintain a vertical drop of about 30 cm from headwater to tailwater over the period of lamprey migration. Although most sea lamprey barriers are of fixed-crest design, alternative designs (i.e., electrical, adjustable-crest, velocity, and combined fixed-crest and electrical barriers) have been built and are being tested. Between 1958 and 1999, 61 barriers of various design have been modified or installed in Great Lakes streams. The GLFC plans to add to the 61 current barriers by building additional barriers on 90 candidate streams (Lake Superior, 10; Lake Michigan, 24; Lake Huron, 23; Lake Erie, 3; Lake Ontario, 24). As we seek to expand the role of barriers in sea lamprey management, we must remain vigilant to the hundreds of existing dams known to limit stream habitat available to sea lampreys. The current movement toward dam removal and fishway construction without regard to sea lampreys could result in additional habitat becoming available to sea lampreys. The loss of one or two large dams could easily overshadow the gains made through all the purpose-built sea lamprey barriers to date.",,,,,,,,,100,1,0,0,88,0,127,,,0380-1330,,,,,,,,,,,"US Fish & Wildlife Serv, Ludington, MI 49431 USASea Lamprey Control Ctr, Dept Disheries & Oceans, Sault Ste Marie, ON P6A 6W4, CanadaInt Joint Commiss, Ottawa, ON, Canada",Int Joint Commiss,,,2003-01-01,WOS:000221321300027,,

A new regional Mg / Ca calibration for the benthic foraminifera Cibicidoides wuellerstorfi (type B) was established to convert the benthic Mg / Ca value to BWT, based on 26 surface sediment samples and two core-top samples retrieved around Okinawa Island. During the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM), the delta O-18(w) in the intermediate water in the northwestern South Pacific was similar to 0.4 parts per thousand lower than in the deep South Pacific, indicating a greater vertical salinity gradient than at present. This salinity (and probably density) structure would have led to stratification in the intermediate and deep Pacific, which would, in turn, have greatly influenced carbon storage during the glacial time. The benthic Mg / Ca and delta O-18(w) records suggest changes that seem to follow Heinrich event 1 (H1) and the Bolling-Alleod (B/A) and Younger Dryas (YD) intervals, with BWT higher during H1 (similar to 17 kyr BP) and YD (similar to 12 kyr BP) and lower during B/A (similar to 14 kyr BP). The warming in the bottom water during H1 suggests increased contribution of North Pacific Intermediate Water (NPIW) to the subtropical northwestern Pacific and decreased upwelling of cooler waters from the abyssal North Pacific. During the interval from 17 to 14.5 kyr BP, the BWT tended to decrease successively in association with a decrease in delta C-13 values, presumably as a result of increased upwelling of the abyssal waters to the intermediate depths of the North Pacific caused by shoaling and enhancement of the southward return flow of Pacific Deep Water (PDW).

The below-freezing conditions have effectively removed permafrost organic material from the modern carbon cycle and preserved its pre-freezing bulk and molecular states. The conditions that lead to efficient burial of organic carbon (OC) within permafrost were investigated by measuring OC stocks, past accumulation rates, and biogeochemical composition of a permafrost core taken from Interior Alaska dating back to 40 ka. The post-glacial Marine Isotope Stage 1 is represented by the top 1.2 m of the core and contains 64.7 kg OC/m(2) with an accumulation rate of 4.3 g OC/m(2)/yr. The sediments that accumulated around the Last Glacial Maximum contain 9.9 kg OC/m(2) with an accumulation rate of 0.5 g OC/m(2)/yr. Carbon storage (144.7 kg OC/m(2)) and accumulation (26.1 g OC/m(2)/yr) are both observed to be greatest between 35 and 40 ka, late during the Marine Isotope Stage 3 global interstadial. The extent of OC degradation was assessed using lignin and amino acid biomarkers with both approaches indicating well-preserved contemporary active layer and interstadial OC, whereas stadial OC was highly degraded. Lignin compositional indices throughout the core appear altered by sorptive processes that confounded some expected trends in the overall organic matter composition, while amino acids provided a more integrated pattern of change. Significant correlations between carbon-normalized hydroxyproline and total lignin concentrations further support the usefulness of hydroxyproline as an indicator for the abundance of plant organic matter. A novel amino acid plant-microbial index of the ratio of microbial-specific muramic acid and diaminopimelic acid biomarkers to the plant-specific hydroxyproline biomarker, indicate a transition from plant-dominated organic matter in fresh organic soils (index values of 0.01-0.20) to more microbial-dominated organic matter in degraded mineral soils (index values of 0.50-2.50). The branched glycerol dialkyl glycerol tetraether composition is complex and is not immediately compatible with existing temperature transfer functions. Residence time within the active layer is interpreted to integrate key factors such as primary productivity, inorganic sediment delivery, and other climate factors that control soil organic matter degradation. The Marine Isotope Stage 3, mid-Wisconsin interstadial period at this locality was forest-dominated and suggests the currently prevailing tundra ecotone is sensitive to environmental change. The majority of buried permafrost OC is high in degradability and if thawed, would be expected to be highly vulnerable to microbial decomposition. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

The problem involves multiple offshore production facilities, each of which requires regular servicing by support vessels to replenish essential commodities such as food, water, fuel, and chemicals. The support vessels are also required to assist with oil off-takes, in which oil stored at a production facility is transported via hose to a waiting tanker. The problem is to schedule a series of round trips for the support vessels so that all servicing and off-take requirements are fulfilled, and total cost is minimized. Other constraints that must be considered include vessel suitability constraints (not every vessel is suitable for every facility), depot opening constraints (base servicing can only occur during specified opening periods), and off-take equipment constraints (the equipment needed for off-take support can only be deployed after certain commodities have been offloaded). Because of these additional constraints, the scheduling problem under consideration is far more difficult than the standard VRP. We formulate a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) model for determining the optimal vessel schedule. We then verify the model theoretically and show how to compute the vessel utilization ratios for any feasible schedule.

Although Australian paramedic practice has steadily evolved to include increasingly complex medical interventions in the prehospital setting, paramedics are not yet registered health professionals, and in many states and territories their title is not protected. Similarly, tertiary-level education is becoming the entry to practice standard for traditional ambulance paramedics; however, certificate-and diploma-level paramedic courses remain an acceptable pathway to private and industrial paramedic jobs. To ensure acceptable patient safety standards are maintained and to protect all related stakeholders, the role, skills, training, and professional capacity of industrial paramedics must be defined.Methods: The study objective was to explore the published literature for a definition for the discipline of industrial paramedicine. A comprehensive systematic analysis was conducted using the EBSCOhost (health), MEDLINE, SCOPUS, and CINAHL electronic databases. The primary search terms remote, offshore, mining, and oil were combined with the secondary search terms paramedic and emergency medical services.Results: An initial search using the combined two-term sets identified 870 citations. After application of the inclusion and exclusion criteria to a title and abstract review, 69 citations met the criteria including those discovered by searching the reference lists. Of these, nine citations were excluded because full-text papers could not be found and eight citations were excluded based on review of the full article. The result was 40 articles that discuss the role of paramedics in the remote or offshore environment (ROP) and 12 articles that discuss the provision of emergency medical services in the mining or oil and gas sectors (MOEMS). There is no single definition or comprehensive role description for industrial paramedic practice within the literature.Conclusions: Worldwide, there is little high-quality published evidence to adequately reflect all aspects of industrial paramedic practice. However, based on the literature available, this definition is offered: 'An industrial paramedic is an advanced clinical practitioner in paramedicine with an expanded scope of practice. The industrial paramedic provides emergency response, primary health care, chronic disease management, injury prevention, health promotion, medical referral, and repatriation coordination at remote mining sites, offshore installations, and other isolated industry settings. The industrial paramedic is resourceful, adaptable, and comfortable working independently. Industrial paramedics practice on site with limited resources, remotely located from tertiary care, and use telemedicine to consult with other health professionals as required. Industrial paramedics are experts at rapidly assessing, prioritising, and establishing control in their unpredictable workspace to reduce risks and create an environment conducive to quality patient care. The industrial paramedic preferably holds a specialised tertiary qualification and is committed to maintaining their clinical competency through continuing professional development.' Further research is required to validate, refute, or expand this proposed definition.",,,,,,,,,10,0,0,0,1,0,11,,,1445-6354,,,,,,,,,,,"Charles Sturt Univ, Bathurst, NSW 2795, Australia",,,,2015-08-09,WOS:000357712600012,25480308,

The relationship between the ratios of the increase of wind speed near the surface and fetch length within 5 km of the coast was analyzed via LiDAR observations taken at heights from 40 to 200 m. The results showed that the speed of the coastal wind blowing from land to sea gradually increased as the fetch length increased, by approximately 15-20% at 50 m above sea level around a fetch length of 2 km. Moreover, empirical equations were derived by applying the power law to the relationship between the increase of wind speed and fetch lengths at 1-5 km, as obtained from the LiDAR measurements.

In the present study, we used terrestrial arthropods collected from seven (three lightly-oiled, four heavily-oiled) sites in Barataria Bay and from three unoiled reference sites in Delacroix, Louisiana, to determine the impacts of the distribution and re-distribution of Deepwater Horizon (DWH) oil on these saltmarsh ecosystems.

The results show that the terrestrial arthropods were negatively affected by the re-distribution of DWH oil by Hurricane Isaac in 2012, although the level of impacts varied among the arthropod groups. Moreover, the mean diversity index was higher (>1.5) in 2014 than in 2013 (<1.5) for all sites, suggesting a recovery trajectory of the saltmarsh arthropod population. The higher taxonomic richness observed in the reference sites compared to the oiled sites for both years also indicated long-term impacts of DWH oil to the saltmarsh arthropod community.

Accurate estimation of fragmentation effects should account for additive edge effects and edge age. Here we investigated those effects on C stock and forest structure (density, height, basal area) in fragments (13 to 362 ha) of forest with >= 70 years old, surrounded by pasture, in the Brazilian Atlantic forest region. We measured 5297 stems sampled in four categories replicated in eight fragments: fragment interiors (> 110 m from edges); old (> 50 years) corner edges (< 50 m); old straight edges; and new (ca. 44 years) straight edges. Aboveground biomass was estimated from tree height and diameter at breast height, and converted to carbon. Carbon stock was highly variable between categories, scoring from 10.44 Mg ha(-1) up to 107.59 Mg ha(-1) (average of 41.27 +/- 23 Mg ha(-1)). Contrary to our expectations, interior plots did not have higher carbon stock, basal area or tree stem density than edges, but only taller trees. We found no significant effects of edge age or additive edge effects on carbon stocks. These results suggest that edge effects in the Atlantic rainforest may differ from those observed in more recently fragmented tropical forests, such as the Amazonian forest. We hypothesize that in heavily human-modified landscapes, more extensive edge effects combined with other human disturbances on tree mortality and carbon stock may contribute to overall high levels of degradation, reducing differences between edge and interior habitats. Existing models based on Amazonian forest data may underestimate the true impacts of fragmentation on carbon storage in landscapes with an old history of human disturbance.",,,,,,,,,14,0,0,0,12,0,15,,,0378-1127,1872-7042,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Sao Paulo, Lab Ecol Paisagem & Conservacao, Dept Ecol, Inst Biociencias, Rua Matao 321,Travessa 14, BR-05508900 Sao Paulo, SP, BrazilMiguel Hernandez Univ, Dept Appl Biol, Elche, SpainUniv Estadual Campinas, UNICAMP, Nucleo Estudos & Pesquisas Ambientais NEPAM, Rua Flamboyants,155 Cidade Univ, Campinas, SP, Brazil",,,,2018-12-28,WOS:000418214300008,,

Tautogs, which aggregate around structured habitats (wrecks, rocks, bridge pilings, etc.), are slow to mature and have a low reproductive rate relative to other teleosts. Slow growth and easy catchability result in Tautogs being extremely vulnerable to overexploitation, and their populations are slow to rebuild. At present, Tautogs are managed by the Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission as four separate regions: Massachusetts-Rhode Island, Long Island Sound, New Jersey-New York Bight, and Delaware-Maryland-Virginia, despite a lack of genetic information to support this management scenario. The objective of the current study was to investigate the genetic connectivity of Tautogs throughout their management zone and provide stock structure information in support of fisheries management. We developed and used 18 variable microsatellite loci to evaluate the genetic structure of 789 Tautogs sampled across their effective U.S. East Coast range from Massachusetts to North Carolina. We also amplified and sequenced a 1,267 base pair portion of the mitochondrial DNA control region from Tautogs sampled from Massachusetts and Virginia. Comparison of pairwise F-ST values among samples collected from locations south of Cape Cod, Massachusetts, were low and nonsignificant, suggesting that gene flow is sufficient to prevent the accumulation of genetic differences. The collection from Cape Cod Bay, Massachusetts, was genetically distinct from all other samples (F-ST = 0.021 to 0.046), indicating that Cape Cod is a significant barrier to dispersal for Tautogs and suggesting that Tautogs north and south of Cape Cod should be managed as separate stocks.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,0002-8487,1548-8659,,,,,,,,,,"Coll William & Mary, Virginia Inst Marine Sci, POB 1346, Gloucester Point, VA 23062 USA",,,,2020-06-19,WOS:000538289600001,,

The geographical distribution of hydrates deposits on earth, the thermodynamics of why they occur in those particular places and source of the methane gas that is eventually enchlathrated into hydrates are discussed.

This trend has been politically galvanized in Article 2, point 5 of the Convention on the Protection of the Underwater Cultural Heritage (UNESCO, 2001), which states that 'The preservation in-situ of underwater cultural heritage shall be considered as the first option before allowing or engaging in any activities directed at this heritage'. Over the years, a number of different remediation strategies have been utilized in order to protect underwater cultural heritage sites in situ, and most of the techniques or combinations thereof involve reburial of sites. Reburial may be an appropriate means of stabilizing and decreasing the deterioration rate of a site, however, there needs to be a holistic approach to the study of the environment, before and after reburial, to gain a full understanding of the changes that are occurring on the site and determine the effectiveness of the technique.In early 2000, the James Matthews, a copper-sheathed, wooden-hulled vessel wrecked in 1841 south of Fremantle, Western Australia, was identified as being under considerable threat from increased site exposure due to a combination of natural near-shore sedimentary processes and industrial activity in the immediate area. An extensive on-site conservation survey was carried out to establish the state of preservation of the wreck and provide information regarding the physico-chemical and biological nature of the environment prior to the implementation of any mitigation strategy. In 2003 it was confirmed that further exposure of the site was occurring and devising a management plan was of paramount importance.Since this time a number of different reburial techniques have been trialled on the site and these include sand bags of differing material composition, polymeric shade cloth, artificial sea grass mats made from polyvinyl chloride bunting, and the use of interlocking medium density polyethylene 'crash barrier' units in a cofferdam arrangement to confine deposited sand.The geological, physico-chemical, and microbiological changes in the burial environments have been monitored over this time. Furthermore, the broader scale, near-shore sedimentary processes affecting the site are being assessed in order to establish the reasons behind the continuing sediment loss. In situ preservation of the iron fittings by cathodic protection has also been included in these field trials. In this paper the results from these experiments will be summarized.

J,,,,,,,,,Peter Talling,,Developing a Global Listening Network for Turbidity Currents and Seafloor Processes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Awarded Grant,Jun 30 2019,2019,"Our overall aim is to make fundamental step-changes in understanding of seafloor processes and hazards by developing and demonstrating novel sensor systems, which can form widespread and long-term listening networks. These low-cost and energy-efficient sensors comprise hydrophones (acoustic noise in water column) and geophones (ground shaking). Data will be returned via pop-up floats and satellite links, as has been pioneered by the highly successful Argo Project for water-column profile.This type of low-cost network could have unusually widespread applications for warning against threats to valuable seabed infrastructure, monitoring leaks from CCS facilities or gas pipelines, or for tsunami warning systems. Here we aim to answer fundamental questions about how submarine mass-flows (turbidity currents and landslides) are triggered, and then behave. These hazardous and often powerful (2-20 m/s) submarine events form the largest sediment accumulations, deepest canyons, and longest channel systems on our planet. Turbidity currents can runout for hundreds to thousands of kilometres, to break seabed cable networks that carry >95% of global data traffic, including the internet and financial markets, or strategic oil and gas pipelines. These flows play a globally important role in organic carbon and nutrient transfer to the deep ocean, and geochemical cycles; whilst their deposits host valuable oil and gas reserves worldwide. Submarine mass flows are notoriously difficult to measure in action, and there are very few measurements compared to their subaerial cousins. This means there are fundamental gaps in basic understanding about how submarine mass flows are triggered, their frequency and runout, and how they behave. Recent monitoring has made advances using power-hungry (active source) sensors, such as acoustic Doppler current profilers (ADCPs). But active-source sensors have major disadvantages, and cannot be deployed globally. They can only measure for short periods, are located on moorings anchored inside these powerful flows (which often carry the expensive mooring and sensors away), and they need multiple periods of expensive research vessels to be both deployed and recovered. We will therefore design, build and test passive sensors that can be deployed over widespread areas at far lower cost. These novel sensors will record mass-flow timing and triggers; and changes in front speed (from transit times), and flow power (via strength of acoustic or vibration signal).We will first determine how submarine mass flows are best recorded by hydrophones and geophones, and how that record varies with flow speed and type, or distance to sensor. Our preliminary work at three sites already shows that hydrophone and geophones do record mass-flows. Here we will determine the best way to capture that mass-flow signal, and to distinguish it from other processes. This work will form the basis for designing a new generation of low-cost (< £5k) smart sensors that return data without expensive surface vessels; via pop-up floats and satellite links. Advances in technology make this project timely, as they allow on-board data processing by smart hydrophones or geophones to reduce data volumes, which can be triggered to record for short periods at much higher frequency. We will field-test the new smart sensors, and thus demonstrate how they can answer major science questions. We seek to understand what triggers submarine flows, and how this initial trigger mechanism affects flow behaviour. In particular, how are submarine flows linked to hazardous river floods, storms or earthquakes, and hence how do they record those hazards? Do submarine flows in diverse settings show consistent modes of behaviour, and if not, what causes those differences? To do this, we will deploy these new sensors along the Congo Canyon (dilute river, passive margin, no cyclones) offshore Taiwan.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,NE/S010068/1,,,,,,,,Durham University,,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:15339306,,
J,,,,,,,,,David Werner,,Remediation of polluted sediment assisted by tidal energy,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Awarded Grant,Jul 31 2006,2006,"Many estuaries and river sediments in the UK and worldwide are impacted by organic pollutants at levels which are harmful to the ecosystem. For instance, the Tyne Estuary in the North of England is heavily polluted with petroleum hydrocarbons, including polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), and recent studies demonstrated ecotoxicological effects in fish, e.g. flounder and eels. The EU water framework directive lists PAHs as priority substances in the field of water policy because of their carcinogenic potency.Natural processes such as the microbial break-down and the strong adsorption of pollutants like PAHs to certain sediment constituents (e.g. carbonaceous particles) can reduce the ecotoxicity of polluted sediment significantly. However, the limited availability of nutrients and oxygen, the formation of ecotoxic products from microbial break-down, a limited number of strong sorption sites in natural sediment, and slow mass transfer of pollutants from weak sorbents to microorganisms or strong sorbents may impede a natural recovery. It is thus proposed to devise a low-cost engineering system in which natural processes leading to a sediment recovery can be enhanced in a controlled setting.Tidal energy will be exploited to agitate the sediment and replenish it with nutrients and oxygen. This will accelerate the microbial break-down of the degradable portion of the pollution. The labile, but non-degradable portion of the pollution and eventual break-down products will be removed from the sediment by infiltrating the effluent from the system across a bed with an adsorbent. The residual pollution in the sediment will be sequestered by adding a dose of a strong, preferably natural sorbent (e.g. coal) to the sediment at the end of the treatment. Presumably this will result in a substantially reduced sediment ecotoxicity and longterm stabilization of the residual pollution.By exploiting tidal energy and natural processes the costs for this treatment can be kept low. The scheme could be implemented in situ to avoid the removal of sediment or ex situ, possibly within existing structures such as abandoned dry docks, to treat sediment from routine dredging operations. The in situ emplacement or ocean disposal of treated, stabilized sediment would implicate less risks than disposal of the untreated sediment, or the treated, stabilized sediment may become an acceptable material for use on shore, e.g. as a filling material.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,EP/D079055/1,,,,,,,,Newcastle University,,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:15314006,,

These include deep-diving robotic submarines, gliders and surface vehicles that can take sensors to measure large areas in remote parts of the ocean. As the capability of marine and aerial autonomous systems increases more potential applications are becoming apparent, including the possibility to improve monitoring of industrial activities at sea. There is particular interest in how autonomous systems can be used to improve the quality and efficiency of routine monitoring of the environment and infrastructure relating to the oil and gas industry. There are also questions about how these systems can be used to monitor, and help in the response to oil spills. This project aims to investigate how autonomous surveillance systems (aerial and marine) can fit into emergency oil spill response and routine monitoring of the environment and infrastructure in the oil and gas industry.A researcher from the National Oceanography Centre (NOC) will work as an intern at Oil Spill Response Limited, an industry funded cooperative that responds to oil spills globally. The intern will carry out a wide ranging review of the scope of autonomous systems used commercially and in research to identify systems and sensors that may be applied in response to oil spills or routine monitoring. The work will then consider the design of surveys using multiple platforms such as autonomous marine and aerial vehicles to identify the requirements from deployment to data management. This will draw on lessons learned from NOC's experience with MAS. The conclusions from these studies will be used to investigate how autonomous systems could be incorporated into routine operations in an industrial setting which will them be presented to and discussed with members of the oil and gas industry and research community.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,NE/P013228/1,,,,,,,,National Oceanography Centre,National Oceanography Centre,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:15351989,,

Not only the Arctic Five (A5) countries, whose coasts are directly washed by the Arctic Ocean, are interested in their realization, but non-regional states also. The 1982 UN Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) gives them such opportunities. According to UNCLOS, the central part of the Arctic Ocean beyond the 200-mile exclusive economic zones (EEZ) of the Arctic countries can be considered as a high seas enclave, with all freedoms of the high seas: of navigation; of overflight; of fishing; of scientific research; freedom to lay submarine cables and pipelines; to construct artificial islands and other installations. The high seas are open to all states, whether coastal or land-locked, which have equal rights here. In addition, it should be noted that other countries have a right to carry out certain practical activities associated with three (out of six) freedoms named above: of navigation (with some restrictions under Article 234 of UNCLOS); of overflight; freedom to lay submarine cables and pipelines - within the Arctic states EEZ. The appearance of new Arctic players interested in its spaces and resources is connected with significant increase in risks and threats, primarily non-military. This is largely due to fundamental differences between the Arctic Ocean and other sea areas, such as the Indian or Atlantic Ocean. Among these differences: only five Arctic states are washed by the Arctic Ocean's waters; shallow depth; small total area; a significant length of the shelf zone; special climate conditions, including ice cap; finally - ecological vulnerability. In this regard, the process of the Arctic region's opening for different kinds of maritime activities implementation poses a problem of the environmental security, protection and preservation of the marine environment and its biological diversity. Despite the fact that security issues in their traditional interpretation are not under the jurisdiction of the Arctic Council, its primary environmental focus indicates that these issues are directly correlated with the main area of its activities. Anyway, the modern interpretation of the security concept includes not only a military, but also an environmental component. For the Arctic states, whose geographical position makes them the first victims of any environmental disaster in the region, the provision of environmental security should be the main priority in their mutual policies. The most effective model for the non-military security threats response in the Arctic is cooperation and coordination between all Arctic states at the regional level. One of the problems in the way is that the Arctic Ocean could not be compared with the Baltic and Mediterranean Seas, to which the Article 123 of the UNCLOS Cooperation of States Bordering Enclosed or Semi-Enclosed Seas provides the states' right to coordinate the management, conservation, exploration and exploitation of the living resources of the sea, and to coordinate the implementation of their rights and duties with respect to the protection and preservation of the marine environment. However, the recent transformation of the international maritime law gives Arctic countries some opportunities in this area.First, the regime of the high seas is becoming less conducive for implementation of specific types of maritime activities. In the future, we can expect that the extent of regulation in this area of the World ocean will be significantly increased. The implementation of the high seas freedoms is largely conditioned by the realization of the tasks to protect and preserve the marine environment and its biodiversity. Second, there is a continuing practice of expanding the authority of coastal states in their jurisdiction zones, especially in the EEZ. Despite the fact that the coastal state is not granted any competence in the field of the EEZ security, the practice of a broad interpretation of the security concept includes food, resource and environment security. The enforcement of such security regimes is becoming an increasingly common practice, even though it imposes certain restrictions for third countries' rights in these sea areas. Finally, the adoption of security measures in the EEZ, on one hand, and at the high sea, on the other, should be recognized interdependent and considered all together. In the near future, the number of potential security threats can be significantly expanded due to the increase in the number of maritime activities participants. In addition to the already existing non-military threats (pollution of the marine environment; illegal, unregulated and unreported fishing), new threats may appear: armed robbery of ships (piracy); acts of terrorism affecting both the shipping and offshore installations (oil and gas platforms); illegal transportation of weapons, including weapons of mass destruction (WMD); illegal transportation of narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances; illegal movement of people by sea, including illegal migration. An effective response to these types of threats requires not only individual efforts of the Arctic Five countries, but also collective security measures. In this regard, in order to create a regional security model, the development of collaboration and cooperation between the Arctic countries is essential.",,,,,,,,,2,0,2,0,0,0,3,,,0131-2227,,,,,,,,,,,"Russian Acad Sci IMEMO, Primakov Inst World Econ & Int Relat, 23 Profsoyuznaya Str, Moscow 117997, Russia",,,,2016-02-01,WOS:000453172100007,,

One of the main questions is how to test and predict the lifetime of such structures in the laboratory. This study presents one approach that has been developed to characterize and predict the degradation of polyurethanes used as thermal insulation materials.Based on results obtained during accelerated ageing of the PU in sea water, a prediction of degradation through the thickness has been set up taking into account the temperature profile in the coating, water absorption and hydrolysis. Validity of this model has been investigated by comparing predictions with experimental data obtained on a real structure that has been aged for more than a year with an internal temperature up to 125 C in water under hydrostatic pressure. Using this prediction, the effect of different parameters (such as coating thickness, internal and external temperature) on the degradation level of a structure has been examined.

Carbon dioxide (CO2) injection wells for Japan's (or a certain country's) CCS in the immediate future are to be located keeping proper space among one another within one or two intensive sea areas, so that the human and financial resources could be efficiently allocated to the geological survey, the environmental assessment, the public communication and moreover to monitoring after the launch of CCS. Then, multiple existing plants would be retrofitted to the CO2 capture facilities on their respective reasonable scale. Capture-ready new plants may also be fitted well to this scheme. CO2 would be transported by ships from the multiple sources to the storage site complex and injected to the assigned wells via socket buoys.

Besides politics, current exploration and production are limited by the technology, which may lie in deeper wells, higher pressure reservoirs, or crudes which are difficult to recover because of higher viscosity.Innovative offshore technology needs to be developed to carry out deepwater production and operations. At the same time, these hazardous operations (i.e., deeper wells and higher pressure reservoirs) are creating new and unique hazards.

In this study, we develop a two-dimensional (2D) amphiphilic nanoplate as the herding surfactant for retracting spilled oil offshore on the seawater surface with various temperature and saline concentrations. Applying 2D nanoplate herding surfactant causes areas of thin oil slick floating on water to largely shrink and form a thick bulk layer.

Microwave-assisted synthesis method was used to fabricate the surface-modified zirconium phosphate (ZrP) nanoplates as the oil herder, which has an amphiphilic characteristic, containing both hydrophilic and hydrophobic properties. The 2D nanoplate surfactants decrease the air-water surface tension to facilitate the oil herding process efficiently.

J,,,,,,,,,Simon Rowland,,"DC networks, power quality and plant reliability",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Awarded Grant,Nov 01 2019,2019,"The movement of electrical energy from generators to customers, through electricity networks, has historically been based on High Voltage Alternating Current (HVAC) technology. This has been a major success of the twentieth century, enabling reliable and stable energy supplies across the developed world. The technology dominated partly as a result of the ability to change voltage levels readily and efficiently using transformers. The alternative technology of High Voltage Direct Current (HVDC) has historically only been used for point-to-point links because of particular advantages in this situation. Now however, with the advent of power electronics, utilisation of HVDC systems is rapidly increasing across the world. This has been accelerated with the growth of renewable distributed energy supplies, such as offshore wind farms in the UK. As a result, local and international energy supplies are becoming dependent on HVDC. Consequently, the reliability of DC technologies is becoming critical as they become more embedded in supply networks. However, in comparison to AC systems, the understanding of insulation and plant reliability under HVDC is still in its infancy. At the same time, the working environment for DC plant is not well documented and, in reality, DC systems have AC ripple, impulses and voltage variation just as in any other system, and these time-varying waveforms are likely to control plant ageing and reliability.This project comprises internationally leading researchers from The University of Manchester, The University of Strathclyde and Imperial College. They bring complementary expertise to form a unique team to address the problem. Prof Tim Green (Imperial) is an expert in the use of power electronics to enhance the controllability and flexibility of electricity networks; Prof Simon Rowland (Manchester) is an authority on ageing of high voltage insulation materials; and Prof Brian Steward (Strathclyde) has unique experience in condition monitoring and insulation diagnostics for high voltage systems. The project is designed to embed the work into the global community and in particular is linked to researchers in China where the largest systems are being developed.This project will firstly identify the voltage profiles experienced by plant insulation in a real HVDC network or link, because in real systems the voltage on the network is not a constant, fixed value. The power converters that feed a DC network create intrinsic noise in the form of high frequency elements as part of their normal operation, and also create voltage disturbances in their responses to fault conditions and emergency overloads. Characterising these is the first step in the overall study of how DC power quality impacts the lifetime of HV insulation. The team will then, through laboratory exploration, develop life models for polymeric insulation subject to known levels of DC power quality. The focus will be on AC ripple over a wide frequency range. In addition, the influence of fast transient signals of varying levels and durations will be considered, as identified above. The third experimental theme is to develop tools for monitoring transient signals and power quality in a real DC cable setting, and enable subsequent interpretation. Finally, we will develop input for utility policy documents on acceptable DC power quality. We will also provide evidence for optimal insulation design for equipment manufacturers and asset management recommendations for utilities. Through these means we hope to de-risk the UK's growing dependence on DC networks, and optimise equipment and system design and operation.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,EP/T001232/1,,,,,,,,University of Manchester,,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:15391427,,
J,,,,,,,,,Casey Hubert,,DEEPBIOENGINEERING,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Awarded Grant,Mar 30 2012,2012,"There has never been a more exciting time to be at the interface of biological engineering and petroleum geosciences. Recent discoveries in geomicrobiology and methodological breakthroughs in DNA sequencing place us on the brink of an unprecedented understanding of the role of microorganisms in globally significant processes in subsurface petroleum reservoirs. Qualified estimates reveal that the vast majority of microorganisms on Earth inhabit the subsurface. Most newly discovered taxa in this 'deep biosphere' have no representatives in laboratory cultures, thus knowledge about their role in economically relevant biogeochemical cycles is unknown. Fossil fuel reservoirs are microbial habitats of great scientific interest and even greater societal importance. Microbes native to subsurface petroleum reservoirs can cause significant damage and economic loss. However, understanding and harnessing this 'petroleum microbiome' has great potential for engineering interventions for more sustainable petroleum production and novel exploration strategies.The next generation of engineers faces the unavoidable challenge of reducing global greenhouse gas emissions. The oil and gas industry is at the epicentre of this challenge. Currently fossil fuels account for greater than 80% of global primary energy supply, yet even under optimistic projections of rapid innovation and modest population growth fossil fuels will still supply 70% of our energy in 2030 (International Energy Agency, 2010). It is clear that the transition towards more sustainable energy will require several decades, that fossil fuels will continue to be essential, and that innovation is needed in all areas of the energy sector. It is critical therefore to develop new engineering interventions and novel technologies focusing directly on the oil indsutry so that existing resources are exploited as responsibly as possible.It has long been recognized that microorganisms are important constituents of petroleum reservoirs and oil production systems, with the presence of sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB) being reported almost a century ago (Bastin, 1926, Science 63:21). SRB are well known in the oil industry because they cause reservoir souring - the production of toxic hydrogen sulfide (H2S). Souring costs the oil industry billions of pounds annually due to production problems related to H2S (e.g., corrosion) and the lower value of high-sulfur petroleum. Nitrate-reducing bacteria (NRB) can be stimulated to control souring in an environmentally friendly way, and while nitrate injection is a strategy beginning to be practised offshore, it remains poorly understood. The first major objective of DEEPBIOENGINEERING is to develop a new understanding of souring and nitrate-driven souring control by applying a combination of geochemistry, microbiology and high throughput nucleic acid sequencing to reservoir production waters and experimental cultures inoculated with them. This research will deliver an unprecedented understanding of the petroleum microbiome, which will underpin prediction-based bioengineering interventions for souring control.The second major objective of DEEPBIOENGINEERING is to exploit the knowledge of the deep petroleum microbiome to track the distribution of formerly indigenous reservoir bacteria. This will lead to a totally new tool for offshore oil and gas exploration. This idea is based on the observation of oil reservoir-like bacteria (thermophilic SRB) in cold ocean sediments (Hubert et al 2009, Science 325:1541) and the hypothesis that petroleum fluids leaking from reservoirs at natural seafloor hydrocarbon seeps is a mechanism for microbe dispersal that can be quantitatively measured. This will lead to predictive models and concepts that will be use bioindicators to map the seafloor and predict or locate seabed hydrocarbon seeps. This environmentally friendly tool will assist offshore exploration for needed petroleum energy resources.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,EP/J002259/1,,,,,,,,Newcastle University,,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:15353678,,

Using radiocarbon measurements, we quantify the fraction of biospheric POC (POCbio) and petrogenic POC (POCpetro) in Changjiang POC. Over the study period, around 25% of the Changjiang POC is radiocarbon-dead POCpetro; the remaining is POCbio with a mean radiocarbon age of similar to 3.5 kyr. Studies on the East China Sea (ECS) shelf along with an oxidation experiment suggest that, prior to dam building, the Changjiang POCbio was significantly oxidized in the ECS margin. In contrast, high preservation of POC is observed in Changjiang reservoirs. Combining our POC data with hydrometric data sets, our study indicates that, over the past five decades, dam building may have largely shifted the Changjiang POC burial site from the ECS margin to terrestrial reservoirs. This shift in burial site preserved labile POCbio that would have been oxidized, suggesting a new temporary carbon sink. We estimate that dam building in the Changjiang has sequestered similar to 4.91.9 megatons POCbio every year since 2003, approximately 10% of the global riverine POC burial flux to the oceans.",,,,,,,,,67,7,0,0,31,0,74,,,2169-8953,2169-8961,,,,,,,,,,"Nanjing Univ, Sch Earth Sci & Engn, Minist Educ, Key Lab Surficial Geochem, Nanjing 210008, Jiangsu, Peoples R ChinaUniv So Calif, Dept Earth Sci, Los Angeles, CA USAPrinceton Univ, Dept Geosci, Princeton, NJ 08544 USAChina Univ Geosci, Sch Earth Sci & Resources, Beijing, Peoples R ChinaHohai Univ, Sch Earth Sci & Engn, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China",,,,2015-03-25,WOS:000349899200004,,

Using gridded annual precipitation maps from 1920 to 2012, and temporal data from airborne light detection and ranging (LiDAR) and MODIS Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI), we present evidence for a large-scale decline in forest canopy volume (area vs. height) and greenness (a metric of photosynthetic function) driven by a long-term drying trend on Hawaii island. Decreases in canopy greenness were observed in step with shorter-term (10 y) precipitation declines, but decreases in greenness were two-fold greater where longer-term (similar to 100 y) precipitation declines had occurred. Canopy volume mainly reduced where long-term precipitation declines occurred.

RIs have not yet been established in the Environmental Risk Assessment procedures for management of oil based discharges offshore.This paper evaluates the usefulness of biomarkers as RIs, based on their properties, existing laboratory biomarker data and assessment methods. Data shows several correlations between oil concentrations and biomarker responses, and assessment principles exist that qualify biomarkers for integration into risk procedures. Different ways that these existing biomarkers and methods can be applied as RIs in a probabilistic risk assessment system when linked with whole organism responses are discussed. This can be a useful approach to integrate biomarkers into probabilistic risk assessment related to oil based discharges, representing a potential supplement to information that biomarkers already provide about environmental impact and risk related to these kind of discharges.

The purpose of the present study was to assess sleep parameters among personnel working in oil and gas offshore installations in the Campos Basin, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. One hundred and seventy-nine subjects were asked to complete a sleep questionnaire with multiple-choice answers. Offshore workers were divided into two groups according to their work schedule: (1) fixed daytime workers (n = 86; age: 35.8 +/- 9.6 yrs) and (2) shift (n = 87) or night (n = 6) workers (total n = 93; age: 37.7 +/- 9.7 yrs). Shift/night workers reported poor sleep more frequently than the daytime workers (20.4% vs. 1.2%, p < 0.01), as well as habitual difficulty in failing asleep (15.1% vs. 4.7%, p < 0.01), long latency of sleep onset (28% vs. 7%, p < 0.01), fragmented sleep (45.2% vs. 16.3%, p < 0.01), short sleep episodes (44.1% vs. 16.3%,p < 0.01), irregular bedtimes (29.0% vs. 12.8%,p < 0.01), and feeling tired upon awakening (15.1% vs. 3.5%, p < 0.01). Habitual napping and loud snoring were reported twice as often in shift/night than in day workers (p < 0.01).

We explored climate-driven oceanic variability as a source of estuarine variability by comparing monthly time series of temperature and chlorophyll-a inside San Francisco Bay with those in adjacent shelf waters of the California Current System (CCS) that are strongly responsive to wind-driven upwelling. Monthly temperature fluctuations inside and outside the Bay were synchronous, but their correlations weakened with distance from the ocean. These results illustrate how variability of coastal water temperature (and associated properties such as nitrate and oxygen) propagates into estuaries through fast water exchanges that dissipate along the estuary. Unexpectedly, there was no correlation between monthly chlorophyll-a variability inside and outside the Bay. However, at the annual scale Bay chlorophyll-a was significantly correlated with the Spring Transition Index (STI) that sets biological production supporting fish recruitment in the CCS. Wind forcing of the CCS shifted in the late 1990s when the STI advanced 40 days. This shift was followed, with lags of 1-3 years, by 3- to 19-fold increased abundances of five ocean-produced demersal fish and crustaceans and 2.5-fold increase of summer chlorophyll-a in the Bay. These changes reflect a slow biological process of estuary-ocean connectivity operating through the immigration of fish and crustaceans that prey on bivalves, reduce their grazing pressure, and allow phytoplankton biomass to build. We identified clear signals of climate-mediated oceanic variability in this estuary and discovered that the response patterns vary with the process of connectivity and the timescale of ocean variability. This result has important implications for managing nutrient inputs to estuaries connected to upwelling systems, and for assessing their responses to changing patterns of upwelling timing and intensity as the planet continues to warm.",,,,,,,,,27,0,0,0,26,0,34,,,1354-1013,1365-2486,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Brest, IFREMER, CNRS, LEMAR,IUEM,IRD, F-29280 Plouzane, FranceUS Geol Survey, 345 Middlefield Rd, Menlo Pk, CA 94025 USAUPMC Univ Paris 06, Sorbonne Univ, UMR 7619 METIS, CNRS,IPSL, F-75005 Paris, France",,,,2017-05-17,WOS:000400445900019,27801968,

A whole cell bioreporter detection method, which has unique advantages for the rapid evaluation on toxicity and bioavailability, is a useful tool to provide environmental risk assessments at crude oil-contaminated sites. Acinetobacter baylyi ADPWH_alk and ADPWH_recA are chromosomally-based alkane and genotoxicity bioreporters which can be activated to express bioluminescence in the presence of alkanes and genotoxic compounds. In this study, we applied Acinetobacter ADPWH_alk and ADPWH_recA bioreporters to examine six seawater and six sediment samples around the Dalian Bay four weeks after an oil tank explosion in Dalian, China in 2010, and compared the results with samples from the same sites one year after. The results of bioreporter detection suggest that seawater and sediments from five sites (DB, NT, JSB, XHP and FJZ) four weeks after the oil-spill were contaminated by the crude oil with various extents of genotoxicity. Among these six sites, DB and NT had high oil contents and genotoxicity, and JSB had high oil content but low genotoxicity in comparison with an uncontaminated site LSF, which is located at other side of the peninsula. These three sites (DB, NT and JSB) with detectable genotoxicity are within 30 km away from the oil spill point. The far-away two sites XHP (38.1 km) and FJZ (31.1 km) were lightly contaminated with oil but no genotoxicity suggesting that they are around the contamination boundary. Bioreporter detection also indicates that all six sites were clean one year after the oil-spill as the alkane and genotoxicity were below detection limit. This study demonstrates that bioreporter detection can be used as a rapid method to estimate the scale of a crude oil spill accident and to evaluate bioavailability and genotoxicity of contaminated seawater and sediments, which are crucial to risk assessment and strategic decision-making for environmental management and clean-up.

Realizing that other Federal, State, and local agencies have different inspection requirements on the same pipelines, the MMS invited interested agencies to participate in a technical workgroup to review existing Federal and State agency requirements for inspections of pipelines on the Pacific Outer Continental Shelf(OCS). The Pipeline Inspection Quality Improvement Team (PIQIT), composed of representatives from the MMS, California Stare Lands Commission (CSLC), California State Fire Marshal (CSFM), and California Division of Oil, Gas, and Geothermal Resources (DOGGR), convened in spring of 1994. The CSFM acted as the representative for the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT). After extensive evaluation of existing inspection requirements, the PIQIT concluded that the best approach to inspecting offshore pipelines is to critically examine each line individually and develop a performance-based inspection schedule for each based on the present condition of the line. The Offshore California Pipeline Inspection Survey (OCPIS) Plan was developed by the PIQIT to provide guidelines to improve the quality of pipeline inspection surveys.The OCPIS Plan is a consensus-based, decisionmaking process intended to provide user agencies with an analytical framework for assessing the present condition and inspection needs of offshore pipelines. Implementation of the OCPIS Plan will permit pipeline operators to develop inspection strategies that are tailored to the needs of individual lines based on the actual condition of the pipeline. Requiring operators to conduct the most beneficial surveys based on the actual condition of the line will improve pipeline safety and reduce the risk of failure while affording industry an opportunity to reduce survey costs as a benefit of diligent and innovative inspection and maintenance.The paper focuses on the OCPIS Plan, the implementation of the OCPIS Plan, the development of a Memorandum of Agreement between the PIQIT agencies, and updating external pipeline inspection requirements and guidelines.

Cell affinity to hydrophobic compounds was quantified using Microbial Adhesion to Hydrocarbons test and analysis of fatty acids profile was performed using the Microbial Identification System.

R. rhodochrous and N. farcinica reached up to 97% and 60% of adhesion to hexadecane, respectively.

The presence of 45.24% of 13:0 anteiso on total fatty acids in R. rhodochrous and 12.35% of saturated fatty acids with less than 13 carbons atoms in N. farcinica, as well as the occurrence of fatty alcohols only in presence of hexadecane in both species, are indicators that fatty acid changes are involved in the adaptation of the cells to remain at the water/oil interface. Cell quantification after bioremediation simulations revealed an increase in the density of both species, suggesting that the bioremediation strategies resulted on the increase of hydrocarbonoclastic species and up to 27.9% of all prokaryotic microbial populations in the microcosms were composed of R. rhodochrous or N. farcinica.

We find that offshore wind power in this region peaks during evening hours across all seasons and maximizes in spring and summer. The timing of peak offshore wind power production better aligns with that of peak demand across California than solar and land-based wind power production, highlighting its potential to fill the supply gap when demand is high and power production from other renewable energy sources is low. We further assess the value of offshore wind power using demand-based and wholesale market metrics. Both metrics indicate high potential value of offshore wind power over most areas in this region. Finally, we show that the estimate of power production is significantly biased when using mean wind speeds that do not account for temporal variability, leading to potentially inaccurate predictions about locations that are expected to produce the most power.

As a result of the deep convection in winter 2014-2015, driven by large oceanic heat loss, mid-depth oxygen concentrations were replenished and anthropogenic carbon storage rates almost tripled compared with Irminger Sea hydrographic section data in 1997 and 2003. Our observations provide unequivocal evidence that ocean ventilation and anthropogenic carbon uptake take place in the Irminger Sea and that their efficiency can be directly linked to atmospheric forcing.",,,,,,,,,67,0,3,0,14,0,71,,,2041-1723,,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Bergen, Inst Geophys, N-5007 Bergen, NorwayBjerknes Ctr Climate Res, N-5007 Bergen, NorwayUniv Toronto, Dept Phys, Toronto, ON M5S A17, CanadaFisheries & Oceans Canada, Bedford Inst Oceanog, Dartmouth, NS B2Y 4A2, CanadaUni Climate, Uni Res, N-5007 Bergen, Norway",Uni Climate,,,2016-11-16,WOS:000386309000001,27786263,

Cluster analysis was used to stratify the sampled fishing trips and official catch statistics into a number of different metiers defined by the target species for the trips. Extrapolation of the observed bycatch rate to total fish landings of the Danish set-net fleet gave an average annual bycatch of 6,785 (CV 0.12) for the North Sea fisheries in the period 1994-1998. Sampling was not sufficient to estimate total bycatch for other areas. Bycatch was observed in Kattegat but not in the Baltic Sea. Generalised Linear Models were used to identify significant factors for bycatch in the North Sea. The bycatch rate, given as number per length of nets X soak time, was significantly lower in fisheries for flatfish compared to roundfish fisheries. The highest bycatch rate was in the cod fishery over wrecks and no bycatch was observed in the sole fishery.

S. alterniflora is a perennial grass native to North America, which has spread rapidly along the southeast coast of China since its introduction in 1979. Our study compared the above and belowground biomass, net primary production, litter decomposition, plant nutrient stocks and soil organic carbon storage of the grasses in three ecosystems: (1) the native ecosystem dominated by C malaccensis: (2) ecosystems previously dominated by C malaccensis but presently replaced by P. australis; and (3) ecosystems previously dominated by C. malaccensis but presently replaced by S. alterniflora. Our results demonstrate that the recent invasion (3 years) of the exotic invasive species S. alterniflora has already significantly increased live aboveground biomass and aboveground plant nutrient stocks. However, there was no significant difference in these variables between native aggressive species P. australis and native C malaccensis. The majority of belowground root Carbon (C), Nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) stocks of the three plant species were all distributed in the upper surface layer and there was a decrease with soil depth. There was little difference in litter decomposition rates among the three grass species; they were ranked in the following order: C malaccensis > S. alterniflora > P. australis. Litter element concentration showed similar patterns for the three species. However, important differences were found between N and P; the litter N concentrations in each of the three species were greater at the end of the 280 days decomposition than at the start, but P concentrations followed a fluctuating pattern during the decomposition period. Soil organic carbon stocks (0-50 cm) under S. alterniflora. P. australis and C malaccensis stands were statistically indistinguishable, which may be due to the invasion of S. alterniflora having been a relatively recent phenomenon. Thus, recent invasion of the exotic species S. alterniflora has already altered the nutrient cycle of C. malaccensis in the ecosystem in the Min River estuary.

Therefore, palynological and organic geochemical analyses were carried out on 37 ditch cutting and 12 core samples from the well. Palynofacies analysis of the Madbi (late Oxfordian-early Tithonian) and Nayfa (Berriasian-Valanginian) Formations sediments indicates deposition of their organic-rich shale, calcareous shale and marl in middle to outer shelf environments under dysoxic-anoxic conditions, containing mainly kerogen of types II to III. However, the shales of the lower Sabatayn (Tithonian) Formation were deposited in an inner shelf environment of prevailing dysoxic-suboxic conditions, and show kerogen types III to II. Regional warm and relatively dry palaeoclimate but with local humid conditions developed near the site of the well is thought to have prevailed during deposition of the studied well sediments. The geochemical analyses of the Madbi Formation show higher total organic carbon content (TOC) than the overlying Sabatayn and Nayfa formations: it is varies between 1.2 and 7, and with average 4 wt% TOC, and the obtained S2 values (similar to 3-10, average 7 mg HC/g rock) indicates that the Madbi Formation is mainly good source rock. It shows a good petroleum potential of 4-11 mg HC/g dry rock, and the Rock-Eval pyrolysis indicates mainly kerogen types II to III (oil to gas prone) of hydrogen index values (132-258, and only one sample from Lam Member is of 360 and average 215 mg HC/g TOC). The thermal maturation parameters as T (max) (425-440 A degrees C), production index (average 0.13 mg HC/g rock) and thermal alteration index (2 to 2+) reflected that this formation is present at margin of maturation to early mature stage oil window. So, the Lam Member (upper part) of the Madbi Formation is considered the main hydrocarbon (oil and gas) source rock in the Marib-Shabwah Basin.

The short-term and long-term impact of this oil spill are significant, and the Deepwater Horizon spill is potentially both an economic and an ecological disaster. Microbes present in the water column and sediments have the potential to degrade the oil. Oil degradation could be enhanced by biostimulation method. The conventional approach to bioremediation of petroleum hydrocarbon is based on aerobic processes. Anaerobic bioremediation has been tested only in a very few cases and is still considered experimental. The currently practiced conventional in situ biorestoration of petroleum-contaminated soils and ground water relies on the supply of oxygen to the subsurface to enhance natural aerobic processes to remediate the contaminants. However, anaerobic microbial processes can be significant in oxygen-depleted subsurface environments and sediments that are contaminated with petroleum-based compounds such as oil-impacted marshes in Louisiana. The goal of this work was to identify the right conditions for the indigenous anaerobic bacteria present in the contaminated sites to enhance degradation of petroleum hydrocarbons. We evaluated the ability of microorganisms under a variety of electron acceptor conditions to degrade petroleum hydrocarbons. Researched microbial systems include sulfate-, nitrate-reducing bacteria, and fermenting bacteria. The results indicated that anaerobic bacteria are viable candidates for bioremediation. Enhanced biodegradation was attained under mixed electron acceptor conditions, where various electron-accepting anaerobes coexisted and aided in degrading complex petroleum hydrocarbon components of marsh sediments in the coastal Louisiana. Significant degradation of oil also occurred under sulfate-reducing and nitrate-reducing conditions.",,,,,,,,,75,3,0,0,42,0,91,,,0273-2289,,,,,,,,,,,"Nicholls State Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Thibodaux, LA 70310 USAMississippi State Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Starkville, MS 39762 USA",,,,2012-08-29,WOS:000306586100008,22350940,

It encompasses the broad, fjord-strewn mainland region, the open waters of Queen Charlotte Sound, the passages of Queen Charlotte Strait, Johnstone Strait and Discovery Passage, numerous island archipelagos, and offshore waters. The central coast boasts abundant natural resources, stunning land and seascapes, and diverse ecosystems. In comparison to other locations in BC, and indeed the world, the central coast is a relatively pristine environment, at least with respect to environmental contamination. Despite spanning approximately half of British Columbia's coastline, the region is home to only 55,000 residents, or 1.4% of British Columbia's total. This low population density largely explains the relatively pristine nature of the central coast. Nonetheless, pollution and contamination concerns do exist in the central coast. Sources of contamination comprise local, regional and global scales, with timeframes for contaminant impacts varying from short to long-term. Past and ongoing activities which have impacted the environment in the central coast include contamination sources associated with salmon aquaculture, oil pollution, wastewater effluent, marine traffic (shipping, boating and cruise ships), forestry and forest products, and mining, as well as the global atmospheric transport and deposition of legacy Persistent Organic Pollutants (POPS), new POPs, and metals. Regulations implemented to eliminate the use of many of the POPs, as well as regulations designed to reduce the by-production of dioxins and furans through pulp processes and wood preservative applications, have helped to reduce the inputs of harmful substances into the coastal waters of the central coast. However, emerging issues are likely to reflect new industrial chemicals and pesticides, increasing cruise ship traffic, the expansion of aquaculture activities, and perhaps most significantly, the potential for the development of offshore oil and gas in the Queen Charlotte Basin. This report will provide the reader with an annotated summary of information sources on what is known about this coastal region of British Columbia. However, significant information gaps exist on basic biology and ecology of the species present in this area, making it difficult to conduct a thorough assessment of the state of the environment in the central coast.

The GUM is approximately 1,500,000 km(2). The five U.S. states bordering the Gulf comprise over 75,000 km of coastline. Gulf circulation is dominated by the Loop Current and gyres. The general trend of longshore sediment transport is in the westward direction west of the Mississippi River and in the eastward direction east of the Mississippi River, and is driven primarily by the wave and tidal energy. The GUM is a shallow basin and its climate is strongly dependent on precipitation and temperature averages. The general coastal climate is subtropical with warm to hot summers and cool winters with precipitation and high relative humidity throughout the year. The GUM coast is predominantly microtidal (<2-m range) with coastal processes and associated morphodynamics strongly influenced by storms. Tropical cyclones have affected every GUM coastal county or parish since 1900. Over 150 rivers flow into the Gulf; 85% of the fluvial water contribution is from U.S. rivers and of that, 64% is from the Mississippi River, which discharges approximately 2.4 billion kg of sediment annually. Humans are altering the natural coastal sediment budget through beach nourishment and dredging that affects the beach-dune sediment exchange. Six of the 10 most socioeconomically vulnerable coastal counties in the United States are in the Gulf region, which emphasizes the need for a sediment management master plan.",,,,,,,,,7,0,0,0,5,0,11,,,0749-0208,,,,,,,,,,,"Univ S Carolina, Marine Sci Program, Columbia, SC 29208 USAUniv S Carolina, Dept Geog, Columbia, SC 29208 USA",,,,2012-06-27,WOS:000304684700003,,

To better understand the ecological consequences of this oil spill on Louisiana estuaries, we compared the abundance and size of two Gulf shrimp species (Farfantepeneus aztecus and Litopeneus setiferus) in heavily affected and relatively unaffected estuaries, before and after the oil spill. Two datasets were used to conduct this study: data on shrimp abundance and size before the spill were available from Louisiana Department of Wildlife and Fisheries (LDWF). Data on shrimp abundance and size from after the spill were independently collected by the authors and by LDWF. Using a Before-After-Control-Impact with Paired sampling (BACIP) design with monthly samples of two selected basins, we found brown shrimp to become more abundant and the mean size of white shrimp to become smaller. Using a BACIP with data on successive shrimp year-classes of multiple basins, we found both species to become more abundant in basins that were affected by the spill, while mean shrimp size either not change after the spill, or increased in both affected and unaffected basins. We conclude that following the oil spill abundances of both species increased within affected estuaries, whereas mean size may have been unaffected. We propose two factors that may have caused these results: 1) exposure to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) may have reduced the growth rate of shrimp, resulting in a delayed movement of shrimp to offshore habitats, and an increase of within-estuary shrimp abundance, and 2) fishing closures established immediately after the spill, may have resulted in decreased fishing effort and an increase in shrimp abundance.

However, this is a limited view of the implications of the problem because there are other deleterious effects that are assumed to be assimilated by the resilient capacity of the marine environment. However, some criteria to evaluate and cope with these additional effects have emerged and should be incorporated into the legislation of such activities. This rationale is applied to oil exploration and exploitation in the southwest of the Gulf of Mexico. The aim is to contribute to the development of a regional framework for the sustainable management of marine water natural resources. An analysis of 10 criteria and 38 attributes of sustainability and impacts caused by this activity were applied here to 26 Mexican legislative instruments. Cluster and multivariate analyses were performed to map the interrelations among legal instruments. The results show a failure of 51-92% to control marine impacts from marine oil drilling and exploitation. Attributes that should be reinforced in the already existing Mexican legal framework include seismic surveys, explosion control, oil pipe networks, oil rig deployment, dredging, channel opening, and ballast water discharge.

To better comprehension of the process, definition of this production system can be divided into phases. Phase I corresponds to the selection of number of wells and type of the well. Then, following the previous work (Franco, 2003), in the Phase II, the layout arrangement of wells and the set of the stationary Floating Production Unit (FPU) are selected. And, in the Phase III, storage and offloading alternatives for the produced oil and gas are selected.The present paper aims to identify environmental impacts associated with the each component of an offshore system for oil and gas production, and quantify each of them through indexes. It is expected to support the decision makers to select the best fitted system for a given offshore petroleum field. The increasing needs of petroleum to fulfill the energy matrix demanded in Brazil, the growing concern of the society for keeping the environment clean and the inclusion of an index related to the environment besides the technical and technological indexes usually taken makes it an important contribution to improve the process for selection and decision about the offshore production system. Particularly, it will be fundamental in the adverse condition of the Pre-salt scenario of petroleum production, in ultra-deep water depth and oil and gas with more aggressive contaminants to the system.The proposed methodology follows a similar procedure for the assessment of environmental impacts through the use of environmental sensitivity index (ESI) and the use of impact matrix (NOOA, 1997; Patin, 1999; Mariano and La Rovere, 2006). For the estimation of environmental impacts, it was defined the ESI of the area to be developed, and it was constructed an impact matrix based on the activities involved in the installation of platform, operational phase and decommissioning of a FPU and the elements from environment. Therefore, this systematic and structured approach allowed incorporating to the process of selection of the offshore production system for an oil and gas field the selection of alternative which combines the best technical and technological characteristics with better aspects from the environment.",,,,,"33rd ASME International Conference on Ocean, Offshore and Arctic Engineering33rd ASME International Conference on Ocean, Offshore and Arctic Engineering","JUN 08-13, 2014JUN 08-13, 2014","ASME, Ocean, Offshore & Arct Engn DivASME, Ocean, Offshore & Arct Engn Div","San Francisco, CASan Francisco, CA",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,978-0-7918-4545-5,,,,,,,,,"Univ Estadual Campinas, Petr Sci & Engn, Grad Program, Campinas, SP, BrazilUniv Estadual Campinas, Fac Mech Engn, Campinas, SP, BrazilUniv Estadual Campinas, LabRiser, Ctr Petr Studies, Campinas, SP, BrazilUniv Estadual Paulista, Stat Appl Math & Computat Dept, Rio Claro, SP, Brazil",,,,2015-11-18,WOS:000363496900051,,

This has recently been illustrated by the Deepwater Horizon disaster, which caused the deaths of 11 people as well as the worst environmental disaster ever to occur in the Gulf of Mexico. Traditionally, the exploration drilling activities in the oil and gas industry have been carried out by a single operator and a drilling contractor. Recently, a new model for organizing exploration drilling has emerged, especially on the Norwegian Continental Shelf. Smaller oil companies are now joining forces by creating a temporary organisation called drilling consortia. While the overall HSE responsibility is held by the operators, this is an operating model which relies heavily on outsourcing. In this way, the drilling activities are becoming more and more organized as networks than traditional hierarchical organization models. This is an organization form which is rarely addressed in the literature on safety management, which usually presupposes that risky activities can be governed within the boundaries of single organizations. This paper presents the preliminary results of a study of the safety consequences for this way of organising exploration drilling. One possible challenge is found in an increased need for coordination when such a large number of separate companies are to cooperate in high risk activities. On the positive side, and somewhat counterintuitive, we found that the new model can actually lead to greater continuity in the execution of many HSE-related activities.",,,,,European Safety And Reliability Conference (ESREL)European Safety And Reliability Conference (ESREL),"SEP 18-22, 2011SEP 18-22, 2011",Univ Technologie Troyes; European Safety & Reliabil Assoc; Reg Champagne Ardenne; Ville Troyes; Ctr Natl Rech Sci; Electricite France; GIS 3SGS; Det Norske Veritas; Grand Troyes; GDR MACS CNRS; MAIFUniv Technologie Troyes; European Safety & Reliabil Assoc; Reg Champagne Ardenne; Ville Troyes; Ctr Natl Rech Sci; Electricite France; GIS 3SGS; Det Norske Veritas; Grand Troyes; GDR MACS CNRS; MAIF,FRANCEFRANCE,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,978-0-203-13510-5; 978-0-415-68379-1,,,,,,,,,"SINTEF, Trondheim, NorwayNTNU Social Res, Trondheim, Norway",,,,2012-01-01,WOS:000392426502092,,

The largest contractors are vertically integrated and diversified outside the upstream oil and gas sector, and the industry has seen varying degrees of consolidation over the years. The demand for pipeline construction fluctuates from year to year, and during periods of sustained low oil prices, demand for services is reduced, causing contractors to resize operations in order to maintain a competitive position in a more challenging market, to form alliances and partnerships in search of other opportunities, and stack and dismantle less competitive vessels to reduce cost.

Two species of shell-borer were found; a burrowing sponge of the genus Cliona and a spionid polychaete of the genus Polydora, probably P. websteri. The incidence of Cliona was similar in both oyster populations and favoured occupation of the left valve. Polydora infestation was greater in oysters on the wreck, as was double infestation by both borers. Polydora appeared to favour both valves equally. Shell-thickening was observed in the wreck oysters and in surf oysters relocated on the wreck; this was thought to be related to the higher incidence of borer infestation at this locality. In the literature these borers are invariably associated with consequences detrimental to the host, so the gonad state of both oyster populations was compared to obtain an index of their welfare. Despite the higher infestation of borers in oysters on the wreck, they manifested no detrimental effects; indeed their reproductive condition was better and they spawned for a longer period than oysters found in the surf. Other differences between the two oyster populations and their environments were considered and it was concluded that some measure of symbiosis is at work.

The Terra Nova Field is located on the Grand Banks approximately 350 km southeast of Newfoundland, Canada, at an approximate water depth of 100 m. Surface sediment samples (upper 3 cm) were collected for chemical and particle size analyses at the site pre-development (1997) and in 2000-2002, 2004, 2006, 2008 and 2010. Approximately 50 stations have been sampled in each program year, with stations extending from less than 1 km to a maximum of 20 km from source (drill centres) along five gradients, extending to the southeast, southwest, northeast, northwest and east of Terra Nova. Results show that Terra Nova sediments were contaminated with > C-10-C-21 hydrocarbons and barium the two main constituents of synthetic-based drilling muds used at the site. Highest levels of contamination occurred within 1 to 2 km from source, consistent with predictions from drill cuttings dispersion modelling. The strength of distance gradients for > C-10-C-21 hydrocarbons and barium, and overall levels, generally increased as drilling progressed but decreased from 2006 to 2010, coincident with a reduction in drilling. As seen at other offshore oil development sites, metals other than barium, sulphur and sulphide levels were elevated and sediment fines content was higher in the immediate vicinity (less than 0.5 km) of drill centres in some sampling years; but there was no strong evidence of project-related alterations of these variables. Overall, sediment contamination at Terra Nova was spatially limited and only the two major constituents of synthetic-based drilling muds used at the site, > C-10-C-21 hydrocarbons and barium, showed clear evidence of project-related alternations.

The total forest biomass (TFB) of S. apetala plantation at 4, 5, 8, and 10 years old was 47.9, 71.7, 95.9, and 108.1 Mg ha(-1), respectively. The forest biomass C storage in aboveground (AGB) and roots at 4, 5, 8, and 10-year plantation was 19.9, 32.6, 42.0, 49.0 Mg ha(-1), respectively. Soil organic C (SOC) on the top 20 cm of sediments increased by 0.3, 6.8, 27.4, and 35.0 Mg ha(-1)after 4, 5, 8, and 10 years of reforestation, respectively.

They sequestrated C at a high but varying rate over time. The large-scale reforestation of S. apetala plantations in the open coastal mudflats in southern China has great potential to sequestrate more C as well as restore the degraded coastal land.

In this work, we evaluate the capability of a nonlinear model predictive controller (NMPC) integrated with an optimization layer to maximize production, minimize energy consumption and mitigate impacts caused by slug flow regimes present in offshore processes. The objective function used in the optimization problem is formulated with the oil and gas production as profit and energy consumption as cost. The degree of freedom of the optimization problem are the topside pressure in the processing plant and the gas-lift injection flow rate in each well. The constraints are the BSW (Basic and Water sediments) and TOG (Grease and Oil content) specifications, capacity of the compression unit and the limits of gas-lift injection, in each well and total flow. The simulated offshore production system encompasses the subsea well, the flowline, the riser, and the topside platform. The subsea part, with four wells, was modeled in OLGA simulator and integrated with a simulated platform in EMSO simulator. The control problem was formulated with nine manipulated variable: gas lift injection and opening choke valve in each well, and interface level in the separator drum. The results show that the controller can reject the slug disturbances, keeping the BSW and TOG inside the limits and driving the process to the setpoints coming from the optimization layer.

The U.S. Gulf of Mexico is a hub of oil and gas exploration and production with recognized consequences on intertidal habitats, such as the salt marsh. Following the BP Deepwater Horizon oil spill, we sampled the marine invertebrate and the terrestrial arthropod community found in stands of Spartina alterniflora, the most abundant plant in coastal salt marshes, in 2010 as oil was washing ashore and a year later in 2011. In 2010, intertidal crabs and terrestrial arthropods (insects and spiders) were suppressed by oil exposure even in seemingly unaffected stands of plants; however, Littoraria snails appeared unaffected. One year later, crab and arthropods appeared to have largely recovered. Our work is the first attempt that we know of assessing vulnerability of the salt marsh arthropod community to oil exposure, and it suggests that arthropods are both quite vulnerable to oil exposure, and quite resilient, able to recover from exposure within a year if host plants remain healthy. BP's Deepwater Horizon spill in the Gulf Coast presented an opportunity to understand how stress from an oil spill might affect variables that we were measuring in the area. The study was conducted at sites in Louisiana and Mississippi. At each site, a 100m transect was sampled within 5m of the dead zone boundary. Sampling was conducted in August 2010 and August 2011. The number of sites and location of sites differed slightly among years.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2015-11-03,DRCI:DATA2015238007482809,,

A detailed review of current deepwater platforms worldwide was performed through the examples of industry projects, and the pros and cons of each platform are discussed. Four types of platforms are currently used for the deepwater development: tension leg platform, Spar, semi-submersible platform, and the floating production system offloading. Among these, the TLP and Spar can be used for dry tree applications, and have gained popularity in recent years. The dry tree application enables the extension of the drilling application for fixed platforms into floating systems, and greatly reduces the cost and complexity of the subsea operation. Newly built wet tree semi-submersible production platforms for ultra deepwater are also getting their application, mainly due to the much needed payload for deepwater making the conversion of the old drilling semi-submersible platforms impossible. These platforms have been used in different fields around the world for different environments; each has its own advantages and disadvantages. There are many challenges with the successful use of these floating platforms. A lot of lessons have been learned and extensive experience accumulated through the many project applications. Key technologies are being reviewed for the successful use of floating platforms for field development, and potential future development needs are being discussed.

Several studies have recently used ecological risk assessment approaches to identify risk factors of greatest concern, but rarely are the underlying methodological decisions discussed in terms of the effect that those decisions have on the outcome of the assessment and ultimately, how that affects prioritisation of risk factors for management.This study therefore evaluates the effect of methodological decisions involving (1) the choice and definition of risk factors, and (2) the calculation of risk scores, providing, where possible, recommendations on what should be the most appropriate methodologies.The definition of risk factors is often determined by the policy context and could result in the comparison of one broadly defined risk meta-factor (e.g. Food Production) with corresponding specific risk factors defined more narrowly (i.e. Oil and Gas production or Offshore Wind). Depending on the method to calculate risk this may result in a systematic bias prioritising any risk meta-factor. For the calculation of individual impact chain risk scores we compared weighted scores with ordinal scores, where the former allows more flexibility to represent the qualitative categories that determine risk and provided results better supported by scientific evidence. A consideration of different risk assessment applications in EBM showed there is no one-size-fits-all solution to this as these methodological decisions need to be considered in concert and the preferred methodology may depend on the context in which the risk assessment is applied. The outcome of the risk assessment should always be accompanied by an explicit consideration of these methodological issues and description of the resulting methodological choices.

Ongoing environmental pressures exerted by large-scale land reclamation for residential quarters, refuse and sewage dumping, and other uses, however, are suspected to have had a substantial impact on ecological health of the Lagos wetland ecosystems over the last few decades. To determine the impact of these pressures, we examined spatial changes in three wetlands areas- Badore/Langbasa (BL), Festac/Ibailjegun (FI) and Ologe/Otto-Awori (OO) through field sample collection and analyses of surface water, sediments, air-water interface gas fluxes and vegetations. Surface water conductivity, total suspended solids (TSS), alkalinity, chloride, biological oxygen demand (BOD), nitrate, phosphate and heavy metals (Zn, Cu, Fe, Na, Mn, Pb, Cd, K and Ni) exhibited relative spatial stability while other water quality parameters varied significantly (P < 0.05) across the wetland areas. Also, dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) contributed to most of the total dissolved solids (TDS) since only DIC correlated significantly with TDS (r = 0.889; P = 0.05, n = 12) and TS (r = 0.891; P = 0.05, n = 12), suggesting a strong capacity for carbon sequestration and carbon sink across the wetland areas. None of the encountered vegetation species are in the vulnerable category of the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). There are indications of steady rise in greenhouse gas levels in Lagos since air CO2 value at BL have reached global threshold of 400 ppm with OO and Fl closely approaching. We conclude that the Lagos wetland ecosystems, especially OO and Fl still have some semblance of natural habitat. However, further destruction and unwise use of the resources could cause damage to physical, chemical, geological and biological processes in nature, which could result to grave socio-economic and cultural consequences to the local communities whose livelihood and lifestyle depend on these valued wetlands.

Oiled marsh treatment involves a delicate balance among: removing oil, speeding the degradation of remaining oil, protecting wildlife, fostering habitat recovery, and not causing further ecological damage with treatment. To examine the effectiveness and ecological effects of treatment during the emergency response, oiling characteristics and ecological parameters were compared over two years among heavily oiled test plots subject to: manual treatment, mechanical treatment, natural recovery (no treatment, oiled control), as well as adjacent reference conditions. An additional experiment compared areas with and without vegetation planting following treatment. Negative effects of persistent heavy oiling on marsh vegetation, intertidal invertebrates, and shoreline erosion were observed. In areas without treatment, oiling conditions and negative effects for most marsh parameters did not considerably improve over two years. Both manual and mechanical treatment were effective at improving oiling conditions and vegetation characteristics, beginning the recovery process, though recovery was not complete by two years. Mechanical treatment had additional negative effects of mixing oil into the marsh soils and further accelerating erosion. Manual treatment appeared to strike the right balance between improving oiling and habitat conditions while not causing additional detrimental effects. However, even with these improvements, marsh periwinkle snails showed minimal signs of recovery through two years, suggesting that some ecosystem components may lag vegetation recovery. Planting following treatment quickened vegetation recovery and reduced shoreline erosion. Faced with comparable marsh oiling in the future, we would recommend manual treatment followed by planting. We caution against the use of intensive treatment methods with lesser marsh oiling. Oiled controls (no treatment set-asides) are essential for judging marsh treatment effectiveness and ecological effects; we recommend their use when applying intensive treatment methods.",,,,,,,,,78,2,0,0,59,0,84,,,1932-6203,,,,,,,,,,,"NOAA, Natl Ocean Serv, Off Response & Restorat, Emergency Response Div, Seattle, WA 98115 USARes Planning Inc, Tallahassee, FL USATulane Univ, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, New Orleans, LA 70118 USARes Planning Inc, Columbia, SC USA",Res Planning IncRes Planning Inc,,,2015-08-17,WOS:000358597100034,26200349,

The wind and wave spectra were selected using noise power density and Joint North Sea Wave Project spectra, respectively. The entire lifting and installation system that responds to environmental loads comprised a vessel, cable, and manifold. The time history of motion response was obtained through simulation and time-domain analysis for the entire lifting and installation process under the combined effect of wind, waves, and current. The motion response of the manifold and the cable tension were analyzed in three stages (entering, steady lowering, and landing phases). The results indicate that the motion responses of the vessel and manifold were highest in the direction of the environmental load. Moreover, the results indicated that the tension of the cable was highest during the entering phase.

Our focus is on uncertainties in top-surface elevation, rock properties (porosity, permeability), fault transmissibility, and aquifer conditions (pressure and temperature). To quantify the statistical characteristics of static trapping capacity and dynamic estimates of plume migration, we create hundreds of possible realizations of the geomodel by applying Gaussian-type perturbations to the spatially correlated properties. Two different simplified methods are introduced to reduce the computational cost of simulating migration over thousands of years in all the model realizations, which each spans hundreds of kilometers. First, we use vertical-equilibrium (VE) modelling, which is orders of magnitude faster than solving the 3D flow equations. Second, we introduce a fast look-ahead algorithm that enables us to exit the VE simulation once a pseudo-steady state is reached. This algorithm uses a spill-point analysis of the top-surface's trapping structure to forecast how much CO2 will eventually become trapped and how much will leak through open boundaries of the formation. This reduces the computational cost significantly, since we seldom need to simulate long-term migration past a few hundred or thousand years.",,,,,,,,,11,0,0,0,0,0,11,,,1750-5836,1878-0148,,,,,,,,,,"SINTEF Digital Math & Cybernet, PB 124 Blindern, N-0314 Oslo, Norway",,,,2018-07-26,WOS:000438493400019,,

In February 2010 all air ambulance operations performed in the Arctic during the period 1999 to 2009 were analysed. The population of this study covered patients with CVD. The state of emergency, state of seriousness (the National Advisory Committee on Aeronautics (NACA) scale was used), flight time, destination, and flying time were the main outcome measures. A total of 45 patients (myocardial infarction 31, angina pectoris 11, and heart failure 4 patients) were identified. There were 39 Norwegians and 6 people of other nationalities.

The TaeanMado Shipwreck No.4 has importance in that it is the first ship from the JoseonPeriod to be discovered and also the first confirmed grain carrier in history.Many relics, such as a bamboo braid hat presumed to have been worn bythe sailors, an iron pot, spade and chopsticks, kitchen ware and a ceramic jarcontaining salted fish, were found in the shipwreck. These relics form importantdata as they make it possible to envision the lives of grain carrier sailors duringnavigation.First, the bamboo braid hat, which seems to have been worn on the headof a sailor, is identical to hats that were used frequently by sailors from theGoryeo Dynasty till the latter half of the Joseon Period. Hats like the bamboobraid hat must have been essential to avoid the sunlight and create some shadeout at sea.The iron pot retrieved from the kitchen section in the middle of the hull was about 7.92 liters, which was a proper size for cooking rice for about 10 people,given that many records have shown us that an adult man in the Joseon Periodate about 1.2 liters of rice each meal. It seems that the sailors who boardedthe grain carrier ate 0.9 liter of rice each meal and 1.8 liters per day. Whilemany chopsticks were present, no spoons were found except the spoon usedas a rice paddle. Without a problem, this can be interpreted as revealing thesocial and economic level of the grain carrier sailors at that time.It is not clear whether the yellow corvine inside the ceramic jar and the fishlike sea-bream were side dishes for the sailors or gifts meant for people inHanyang City. But it is believed that at least one of them was a side dish forthe sailors, given that Goryeo people consumed salted fish frequently asdescribed in Goryeodogyeong(『高麗圖經』) written by Suh-Geung.Space suitable for sleeping was not found in the hull of the Taean MadoShipwreck No.4. The vessel was shaped for shipping taxation grain in allcompartments excluding the kitchen section in the middle. Therefore, it seemsthat the sailors sheltered from rain and wind under the installed makeshiftpavilion. The job of grain carrier sailor was not popular because the work washard and dangerous. The route taken to Hanyang City must had been verywinding as they struggled against the unexpected sea.",,,,"태안 마도 4호선은 15세기 초 태종 시기에 나주 지역의 조세를 싣고 한양으로 향하다가안흥량이라 불리던 태안 앞바다에서 침몰한 조운선이다. 태안 마도 4호선은 지금까지 출수된선박 중 최초의 조선시대 선박이라는 점, 그리고 명확한 조운선이라는 점에서 중요한 의미를갖는다.이 글에서는 15세기 초에 태안 마도 해역에서 침몰한 마도 4호선이 운항하던 시기의 조운상황과 배와 함께 출수된 선상 용품들을 중심으로 당시의 漕卒들이 어떤 생활을 했는지 추정하였다. 그 중 중요한 몇 가지를 정리하여 제시하면 다음과 같다. 먼저 마도 4호선의 출발지는처음에 알려진 것처럼 나주 영산창이 아니라 진포 또는 덕성창 일대였을 것으로 보인다. 둘째,선체와 함께 출수된 수저, 젓가락, 패랭이와 짚신, 참빗과 얼레빗은 조졸들이 사용하던 물품이었던 것으로 보인다. 셋째, 투석칸을 제외한 나머지 공간에 모두 원통목들이 자리 잡고 있어선체 안에는 조졸들이 쉬거나 숙박할 공간이 없었다. 따라서 조졸들은 항해 기간 내내 배 위의뜸집에서 숙식을 해결했을 것으로 보인다. 넷째, 투석칸에서는 철제 솥, 숟가락, 젓가락 등의주방용품이 출수되었는데, 이 중 철제 솥은 약 10인 분 정도의 밥을 지을 수 있는 크기였다.이를 통해 볼 때 이 배에 승선한 조졸은 약 10명 내외였을 것이라고 생각된다.",,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,1598-4893,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2017-02-02,KJD:ART002191200,,

As nitrogen loading to coastal waters continues, primarily in the form of nitrate, it is unclear what effect it will have on carbon storage capacity of these highly productive systems. This uncertainty is largely driven by the dual role nitrate can play in biological processes, where it can serve as a nutrient-stimulating primary production or a thermodynamically favorable electron acceptor fueling heterotrophic metabolism. Here, we used a controlled flow-through reactor experiment to test the role of nitrate as an electron acceptor, and its effect on organic matter decomposition and the associated microbial community in salt marsh sediments. Organic matter decomposition significantly increased in response to nitrate, even at sediment depths typically considered resistant to decomposition. The use of isotope tracers suggests that this pattern was largely driven by stimulated denitrification. Nitrate addition also significantly altered the microbial community and decreased alpha diversity, selecting for taxa belonging to groups known to reduce nitrate and oxidize more complex forms of organic matter. Fourier Transform-Infrared Spectroscopy further supported these results, suggesting that nitrate facilitated decomposition of complex organic matter compounds into more bioavailable forms. Taken together, these results suggest the existence of organic matter pools that only become accessible with nitrate and would otherwise remain stabilized in the sediment. The existence of such pools could have important implications for carbon storage, since greater decomposition rates as N loading increases may result in less overall burial of organic-rich sediment. Given the extent of nitrogen loading along our coastlines, it is imperative that we better understand the resilience of salt marsh systems to nutrient enrichment, especially if we hope to rely on salt marshes, and other blue carbon systems, for long-term carbon storage.",,,,,,,,,48,0,0,0,33,0,59,,,1354-1013,1365-2486,,,,,,,,,,"Northeastern Univ, Dept Marine & Environm Sci, Marine Sci Ctr, Nahant, MA 01908 USAMarine Biol Lab, Ecosyst Ctr, Woods Hole, MA 02543 USAWoods Hole Res Ctr, Falmouth, MA USAUniv Massachusetts, Dept Biol, Boston, MA 02125 USA",,,,2019-10-09,WOS:000476281000001,31317634,

A Severn Barrage, as previously proposed by the Severn Tidal Power Group (STPG), would be the largest renewable energy project for tidal power generation in the world, if built as proposed, and would generate approximately 5% of the UK's electricity needs. However, concerns have been raised over the environmental impacts of such a barrage, including potential increase in flood risk, loss of intertidal habitats etc. In addressing the challenges of maximizing the energy output and minimizing the environmental impacts of such a barrage, this research study has focused on using a Continental Shelf model, based on the modified Environmental Fluid Dynamics Code (EFDC) with a barrage operation module (EFDC_B), to investigate both the far and near field hydrodynamic impacts of a barrage for different operating scenarios. Three scenarios have been considered to simulate the Severn Barrage, operating via two-way generation and using different combinations of turbines and sluices. The first scenario consisted of 216 turbines and 166 sluices installed along the barrage; the second consisted of 382 turbines with no sluices; and the third consisted of 764 turbines and no sluices. The specification of the sluice gates and turbines are the same for all scenarios. The model results indicate that the third scenario has the best mitigating effects for the far-field and near-field flood risks caused by a barrage and produces the most similar results of minimum water depth and maximum velocity distributions to those obtained from simulating the natural conditions of the estuary, i.e. the current conditions. The results also show that the flow patterns around the barrage are closest to those for the existing natural conditions with minimal slight changes in the estuary. Thus, the results clearly indicate that the environmental impacts of a Severn Barrage can be minimized if the barrage is operated for two-way generation and under the third scenario. Although it appears that the energy output for the third scenario is less than that obtained for the other two scenarios, if very low head (VLH) turbines are used, then the third scenario could generate more energy as more turbines could be cited along the barrage structure. Therefore, the study shows that a Severn Barrage, operating in two-way generation and with 764 turbines (ideally VLH turbines), would be the best option to meet the needs of maximizing the energy output, but having a minimal impact on environmental changes in the estuary and far-field.

In this paper reef-controlled mineral deposits are divided into 3 types based on the relative importance of organic reefs in the ore-forming processes. They are: 1. direct type: reef-building organisms directly absorb and collect ore-forming elements through their own living action; 2. indirect type, the ore-forming processes take place in a reel-controlled lagoon or other depressions; 3. passive type; reef rocks only provide an ore-housing space and a favourable geochemical environment. Several typical have been discussed, and the ore-formation mechanisms are summarized and discussed. It is though that the role of reefs in the ore-forming processes should be judged according to specific circumstances. For the algal reefs, the reef rock itself can serve as an important indication for exploration. For somes stratiform deposits such as pyrite and siderite deposits, exploration work should be carried out in a reef-controlled lagoon near the oldland. For the bulk of reef-controlled lead-zinc and antimony deposits, it is necessary to make synthetic studies of relevant factors such as deposition, diagnosis and structure. The syndepositional fault control the distribution of different sedimentary facies in the depositional period, and then, the migration direction of the thermal brines and the position of mineralization. The presence of a paleo-reservoir of oil and gas in organic reefs or banks not only provides a favourable geochemical environment for the percipitation of ore-forming elements, also abundant sulfur. The fundamental cause of reef-controlled mineral deposits formed in carbonate rocks in southern China is the tectonic setting of this region. For instance, in the Hercynian-Indosiuian period southern China was a triangle zone affected by both the Yunnan-Qinhai-Tibet oceanic plate and the Pacific plate. The intense back-arc spreading and rifting not only produced a sedimentary framework characterized by alternating arrangement of plaforms (trenches) and basins, which were apparently controlled by basement faults as well, and also caused a great quantity of ore-forming thermal fluids to rise, thus forming local mineralized seawater. If the mineralized sea-water (plus later thermal brines) was adjacent to a suitable sedimentary or tectonic setting (e.g. reef rocks occurring in the core of an anticline), a stratabound deposit might be formed.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,,0,0,0,,,0001-5717,,,,,,,,,,,"CHENGDU COLL GEOL, CHENGDU, SICHUAN, CHINA",,,,1989-01-01,BCI:BCI199089040886,,

Here, we present a carbon-budget model for transgressive barrier islands that includes a dynamic carbon-storage term, driven by backbarrier-marsh width, and a carbon-export term, driven by ocean and backbarrier shoreline erosion. To examine the impacts of storms, human disturbances and the backbarrier setting of a transgressive barrier island on carbon budgets and reservoirs, the model was applied to sites at Core Banks and Onslow Beach, NC, USA. Results show that shoreline erosion and burial of backbarrier marsh from washover deposition and dredge-spoil disposal temporarily transitioned each site into a net exporter (source) of carbon. The magnitude of the carbon reservoir was linked to the backbarrier setting of an island. Carbon reservoirs of study sites separated from the mainland by only backbarrier marsh (no lagoon) decreased for over a decade because carbon storage could not keep pace with erosion. With progressive narrowing of the backbarrier marsh, these barriers will begin to function more persistently as carbon sources until the reservoir is depleted at the point where the barrier welds with the mainland. Undeveloped barrier islands with wide lagoons are carbon sources briefly during erosive periods; however, at century time scales are net carbon importers (sinks) because new marsh habitat can form during barrier rollover. Human development on backbarrier saltmarsh serves to reduce the carbon storage capacity and can hasten the transition of an island from a sink to a source.",,,,,,,,,16,0,0,0,8,0,17,,,2328-4277,,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Illinois, Prairie Res Inst, Illinois State Geol Survey, Champaign, IL 61820 USAUniv North Carolina Chapel Hill, Inst Marine Sci, Morehead City, NC USA",,,,2017-08-30,WOS:000407785600011,,

Selection of the most suitable strategy among a wide range of potential options to extend the lifetime of equipment (e.g. re-using, reconditioning, remanufacturing, refurbishing and adding on safety/process control measures) remains a challenging task that involves several technical, economic and organizational complexities. In order to tackle this challenge, it is crucial to develop analytical tools and methods capable of evaluating and prioritizing end-of-life strategies with respect to their associated costs and quantifiable benefits. The paper aims to discuss these issues.Design/methodology/approach This paper presents a life-cycle cost-benefit analysis approach to identify the most suitable life extension strategy for ageing offshore assets by taking into account all the capital, installation, operational, maintenance and risk expenditures during the extended phase of operation. The potential of the proposed methodology is demonstrated through a case study involving a three-phase separator vessel which was constructed in the mid-1970s.Findings The results from the application case indicate that the capital expenditure (CapEx) accounts for the largest portion of life cycle cost for the replacement strategy, while risk expenditure (RiskEx) is the major contributor to costs associated with life extension. A sensitivity analysis is also conducted to identify factors having the greatest impact on the optimum life extension solution, including oil price, production rate and money interest rate.Practical implications In the past, the decisions about life extension or replacement of in-service equipment were often made in a qualitative way based on experience and judgment of engineers and inspectors. This study presents a quantitative framework to evaluate and compare the costs, benefits and risks associated with life extension strategies and subsequently to select the best strategy based on benefit/cost ratios.Originality/value To the best of authors' knowledge, no studies before have applied life cycle assessment and cost-benefit analysis methods to prioritize the potential life extension strategies in the oil and gas industry sector. The proposed approach not only assists decision makers in selecting the most suitable life extension strategy but also helps duty holders reduce the costs corresponding to life extension execution.",,,,,,,,,8,2,0,0,0,0,11,,,1355-2511,1758-7832,,,,,,,,,,"Cranfield Univ, Dept Energy & Power, Cranfield, Beds, EnglandCranfield Univ, Dept Mfg, Cranfield, Beds, EnglandIndian Inst Technol Kharagpur, Dept Ind & Syst Engn, Kharagpur, W Bengal, India",,,,2018-08-22,WOS:000441395400003,,

Aims: To investigate the effect of vegetative transplants on saltmarsh sedimentation, the present study aimed to compare short-term sediment deposition and accretion in transplanted sites of Bolboschoenus maritimus and Puccinellia maritima with those in natural stands of these species and with upper unvegetated mudflats. The effect of tidal height and wind direction on sediment deposition in the different systems was also studied. Methods: Sediment deposited each day was collected on pre-weighed filter papers placed on the sediment surface and the sediment accreted each month was weighed in relation to the zero bed level by using a bar placed across marker poles. Results: Older transplants of B. maritimus retained significantly higher quantities of sediment than natural P. maritima or the upper mudflats, but had similar amounts to that deposited in natural B. maritimus. Deposition rates in younger transplants were found to be similar to those on the upper mudflats. Sediment surface elevation in natural P. maritima remained constant throughout the year, but increased in all other sites during the summer. The upper mudflat was the only site to erode during winter. A significant positive association was found between tide height and sediment deposition, while winds from the south-east were associated with significantly more deposition than winds from the south-west. Conclusions: These findings suggest that saltmarsh restoration using vegetative transplants can enhance sedimentation in eroded fringe saltmarsh. This strategy deserves further investigation since it may provide a sustainable management option in the face of rising sea levels.",,,,,,,,,8,1,0,0,6,0,9,,,1755-0874,,,,,,,,,,,"Univ St Andrews, Scottish Oceans Inst, Sediment Ecol Res Grp, St Andrews, Fife, ScotlandUniv St Andrews, Sch Geog & Geosci, St Andrews, Fife, ScotlandUniv St Andrews, Sch Biol, St Andrews, Fife, Scotland",,,,2011-07-06,WOS:000291539300010,,

These increased concentrations cause additional energy to be retained in Earth's climate system, thus increasing Earth's temperature. Various methods have been proposed to prevent this temperature increase either by reflecting to space sunlight that would otherwise warm Earth or by removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. Such intentional alteration of planetary-scale processes has been termed geoengineering. The first category of geoengineering method, solar geoengineering (also known as solar radiation management, or SRM), raises novel global-scale governance and environmental issues. Some SRM approaches are thought to be low in cost, so the scale of SRM deployment will likely depend primarily on considerations of risk.

Lower Cretaceous age rocks make up much of the sediment fill, including flysch-like marine turbidites and shales of the Torok and Fortress Mountain formations and marine and sandstones, shales and conglomerates of the overlying Nanushuk group. Lower Cretaceous age rocks were deposited on top of a Palaeozoic and Mesozoic age passive margin sequence. We have conducted numerical simulations of fluid flow driven by topographic recharge in the Central North Slope foreland basin. These simulations are constrained by salinity estimates from well logs, location of oil and gas fields, vitrinite reflectance and heat flow measurements. Our model results indicate that there are two south to north pathways for fluid migration. The primary pathway for fluid movement is downward through the Fortress Mountain formation, then upwards along the interface between the Fortress Mountain and Torok Formation and finally northward through the permeable Nanushuk group. A smaller mass of groundwater moves along sands below the Torok formation and into offshore sediments north of Alaska. Very little meteoric water enters the underlying Palaeozoic rocks in our simulations, which could explain the presence of deep saline pore waters. Our results also show that permafrost is a primary control on the pathway and rate of fluid flow by controlling the distribution of surface recharge and discharge. For example, areas of high heat flow and low saline waters along the arctic coast may represent upward groundwater discharge because of the absence of permafrost. As surface temperatures were warmer in the Miocene, the absence of permafrost would produce a more local fluid circulation pattern and less transfer of heat energy from south to north.",,,,,,,,,9,0,0,0,3,0,10,,,0950-091X,1365-2117,,,,,,,,,,"Louisiana State Univ, Dept Geol & Geophys, Baton Rouge, LA 70803 USASeoul Natl Univ, Sch Earth & Environm Sci, Seoul, South Korea",,,,2005-09-01,WOS:000231610800004,,

By determining the REE contents of 107 dolostone samples selected from Well Xike-1 in Shi Island, Xisha Islands, an analysis of REE geochemical characteristics of borehole reef dolostone was conducted for the diagenetic environment and interrelation between paleo-climatic event and dolostone stratum. Seven layers of dolostone in Well Xike-1 were similar in REE geochemical characteristics such as abundance, PAAS-normalized pattern and element anomaly, indicating a parallel diagenetic environment. Burial compaction and corresponding diagenesis caused no significant change in REE geochemical characteristics of dolostone, which could basically reflect the nature of diagenetic environment and dolomitization fluid. Several geochemical indices showed that the emergence of dolomitization in Xisha Islands could be interpreted by a seepage -reflux model under a low -temperature and meta-reducing environment with the action of high salinity seawater. The high-salinity brine, formed in relatively closed reef-shoal lagoon and infiltrating along the rock pore, resulted in the metasomatic alteration of dolomite for calcite.

The present study focused on carbon content modeling and mapping in submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV) including seagrass and algae species in coastal water areas (-0.5 to -7 m depth) of the Arabian Gulf using field sampling, laboratory analyses and satellite-based approach. The used Landsat-OLI image, acquired simultaneously with field sampling, was preprocessed rigorously to remove all radiometric and geometric anomalies. The modeling is applied on 55 samples collected from the seabed including biomass of the canopy (above-ground biomass: AGB), roots and rhizomes (below-ground biomass: BGB) and sediments (within a depth 15 cm). Each sampling location was automatically labeled and recorded using a Deep-Blue-Pro underwater digital camera equipped with a sub-meter GPS survey and connected to a laptop computer allowing a real time viewing of seabed. The carbon content was analyzed in the laboratory considering separately the AGB, BGB, and sediments in each sample, and then converted and calculated at the OLI pixel size level. A linear regression at 95% confidence interval was applied between the obtained carbon content at the pixel level and: a) calibrated reflectances in the VNIR spectral bands, b) water spectral indices, and c) percentage of SAV cover (PSAVC) fraction determined by a semi-empirical relation developed previously. The results revealed that the best fit (R-2 = 0.87) was obtained between PSAVC and the total carbon content derived from the biomass (AGB and BGB) and sediments. The cross-validation of derived carbon map based on the proposed modeling approach showed a good correlation (R-2 = 0.74) and an acceptable RMSE of +/- 0.4 kg/m(2). However, despite the limited number of sampling points, the uncertainly of carbon content scaling up at the pixel level, and the errors propagation in modeling process, these preliminary results are encouraging for carbon content modeling and mapping over a large area in shallow water based on optical remote sensing.",,,,,IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium (IGARSS)IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium (IGARSS),"SEP 26-OCT 02, 2020SEP 26-OCT 02, 2020",Inst Elect & Elect Engineers; Inst Elect & Elect Engineers Geoscience & Remote Sensing SocInst Elect & Elect Engineers; Inst Elect & Elect Engineers Geoscience & Remote Sensing Soc,ELECTR NETWORKELECTR NETWORK,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,2153-6996,,978-1-7281-6374-1,,,,,,,,,"Arabian Gulf Univ, Coll Grad Studies, Dept Nat Resources & Environm, POB 26671, Manama, BahrainArabian Gulf Univ, Coll Grad Studies, Dept Geoinformat, POB 26671, Manama, Bahrain",,,,2021-08-18,WOS:000664335305122,,

An alternative approach is also proposed, establishing a direct correlation between spudcan and cone penetration resistances. The approaches are developed based on the results from a parametric study through large-deformation finite-element analyses and validated against centrifuge test data and a case history. These can be taken as a top-down approach. The bearing capacities are evaluated at the seabed, at the depth of maximum bearing capacity in the first (stiff) layer, at the depth of triggering squeezing in the second (soft) layer, and at the second-third layer interface successively, followed by the estimation of the penetration resistance profile in the third (stiff) layer. For the mechanism-based approach, design formulae are also proposed for assessing the limiting cavity depth, variation of the soil plug height, and equivalent undrained shear strength of the second layer that accounts for the effect of the third layer. The depth of triggering squeezing in the second layer is estimated through an iterative approach to incorporate the effect of the soil plug trapped beneath the advancing spudcan, which leads to earlier squeezing. For the alternative approach, design correlations are established between cone tip and spudcan penetration resistances. A direct comparison between the estimated profiles using the proposed design approaches and the bottom-up approach recommended in the current international design standard confirms the benefit of using the former.

Renewable energy resources typically are intermittent and vary significantly in energy intensity. Tidal energy however has the advantage of predictability over large time scales and high power densities. A study of Ireland's tidal-current-energy resource has identified several viable sites. As part of this resource assessment, Acoustic Doppler Current Profilers were installed at two locations along Ireland's west coast, at a site in the Bulls Mouth and the Shannon Estuary. The Acoustic Doppler Current Profilers measured tidal current speed and direction at 30 min intervals over a 30 day period at a range of depths through the water column. This is the first time the measured data appears in the literature as it has only recently been made public. This paper presents tidal current speed and direction, frequency of occurrence of speed, tidal roses at several depths through the water column, and a comparison of theoretical tidal-current-speed profiles with measured data for a site in the Bulls Mouth and in the Shannon Estuary. The paper compares power density at both sites over a lunar month and also proposes a best fit power law exponent with the measured data through the water column. Finally, the paper presents an energetic performance comparison for a tidal current turbine operating at both sites. The data presented in this paper can be used in the design process to estimate the hydrodynamic and structural performance of a tidal current turbine operating under real-life conditions. The data can also be used to assess different control strategies and to design a tidal current turbine to suit the site-specific characteristics. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

The HST was designed for a minimum fifteen-year mission with on-orbit servicing by the Space Shuttle System planned at approximately three-year intervals.Major changes to the HST ground system are planned to be in place for the third servicing mission in December 1999. The primary objectives of the ground system reengineering effort, a project called Vision 2000 Control Center System (CCS), are to reduce both development and operating costs significantly for the remaining years of HST's Lifetime. Development costs will be reduced by providing a modern hardware and software architecture and utilizing commercial off the shelf(COTS) products wherever possible. Operating costs will be reduced by eliminating redundant legacy systems and processes and by providing an integrated ground system geared toward autonomous operation.Part of CCS is a Space Telescope Engineering Data Store, the design of which is based on current Data Warehouse technology. The purpose of this data store is to provide a common data source of telemetry data for all HST subsystems. This data store will become the engineering data archive and will include a queryable database for the user to analyze HST telemetry. The access to the engineering data in the Data Warehouse is platform-independent from an office environment using commercial standards (Unix, Windows95/NT). Latest Internet (e.g. Java) technology is used to reach the HST engineering community. A WEB-based user interface allows easy access to the data archives.This paper will provide a high level overview of the CCS system and will illustrate some of the CCS telemetry capabilities. Samples of CCS user interface pages will be given.Vision 2000(1) is an ambitious project, but one that is well under way.

We provide additional breakdown for oil/gas emissions. Spatial allocation is done using an ensemble of national datasets for methane-emitting activities resolving individual municipalities and point sources. We find that emissions are highest in central Mexico and along the east coast, with substantial spatial overlap between major emission sectors (livestock, fugitive emissions from fuels, solid waste, and wastewater). Offshore oil/gas activities, primarily oil production, account for 51% of national oil/gas emissions. We identify 16 hotspots on the 0.1 degrees x 0.1 degrees grid with individual emissions higher than 20 Gg a(-1) (2.3 tons h(-1)) including large landfills, offshore oil production, coal mines in northern Mexico, a gas processing complex, and a cattle processing facility. We find large differences between our inventory and previous gridded emission inventories for Mexico, in particular EDGAR v5, reflecting our use of more detailed geospatial databases.

Mangroves are one of the most conspicuous groups of foundation species, providing numerous ecosystems services which we highly value, e.g., habitat for ecologically and economically important species, shoreline stablilization and carbon storage. As such, global declines in mangroves is of upmost concern. For example, an extensive die-off of dwarf red mangrove has been identified in a remote area on the west side of Abaco Island, The Bahamas. Because of its remote nature of the site, the die-off is unlikely to be directly due to human activities. Despite its largely inaccessible nature, the area is ecologically and economically important, e.g., it is the primary bonefishing area on Abaco - an industry worth more than $150 million annually in The Bahamas. Therefore, it is of pressing concern for stakeholders in The Bahamas to identify the underlying cause(s) of decline and assess potential threat to mangroves in other areas. To do so, a series of activities will be carried out, included widespread surveys for a recently identified fungal pathogen, laboratory efforts to isolate and identify this pathogen, satellite imagery mapping activities, and simulated grazing experiments. The area in which the die-off is occurring is currently being considered for designation as a national park by the Bahamian National Trust (BNT). The results of the study will be directly communicated to the BNT and will be used to make immediate management decisions. In collaboration with two Bahamian environmental NGOs, Friends of the Environment and Bahamas Reef Environmental Education Foundation (BREEF), a citizen science-based survey for fungal lesions, as well as an educational module on mangrove ecology, will be designed. The data from the citizen-science and student surveys will be integrated in a map of the incidence of the lesions across The Bahamas. The citizen-science component, and interaction with bonefish guides, provides the opportunity to further integrate science and education. The educational module will be introduced at the BREEF summer teaching training workshop in July. This annual event typically includes 30 teachers from 10 islands. The investigators will continue to make all of our research findings immediately available and accessible to the public through the Abaco Scientist website (http://appliedecology.cals.ncsu.edu/absci/). Provisioning of ecosystem services in the coastal realm is largely mediated by foundation species, such as mangroves, coral and salt marsh grasses. Many of these species are undergoing substantial declines throughout the world. These declines are often driven by complex, interacting, stressors that may be difficult to identify and elucidate. Despite the difficulty, unraveling such mechanistic drivers is essential for stemming declines and developing management strategies for these ecosystems. Mangroves provide many highly valued ecosystem services to coastal communities, yet worldwide these forests are rapidly declining. Much of this loss is related to various human activities along coastlines, but natural ecological mechanisms contribute to declines in many areas as well. An extensive die-off of dwarf red mangrove (Rhizophora mangle) was observed in a remote area on the west side of Abaco Island, The Bahamas. Preliminary observations suggest the die-off may be due to a combination of fungal pathogens, grazing, and physical stress. This combination of stressors is strikingly parallel to the drivers of salt marsh decline on the East and Gulf coasts of the U.S. To date, different fungal strains from mangrove leaves have been identified. One fungus is a species of Pestalotiopsis, an Ascomycete fungus, and members of this genus are known plant pathogens. There are also high densities of a nocturnally active herbivorous cricket (Tafilasca eleuthera) in die-off areas. It is unclear whether this species has recently colonized the area, is increasing in density, or both. In addition, high salinities in the sediment porewater in the die-off area suggest another potential stressor for the plants. A series of observations and experimental studies will be used to examine potential mechanistic drivers of the mangrove die-off. First, the extent of the die-off areas will be mapped using aerial surveys conducted with a GPS-integrated drone equipped with a video camera. Progression of the die-off will be examined with historical spectral profiles of mangroves from 1980s-present (on an annual basis) using Landsat satellite data. Second, the incidence of lesions on mangroves across Abaco Island and throughout The Bahamas will be explored using a series of citizen science initiatives. Third, identification of fungi will require DNA sequencing and examination of the morphology of fungal spores/conidia at North Carolina State University. Fourth, maintenance of a grazer exclusion experiment near the die-off location will provide an assessment of the role of herbivory in this system. Finally, simulated grazing scar experiments will be used to assess if grazing can indeed facilitate fungal infections.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,1541637,,,,,,,,North Carolina State University,,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:13892433,,

Drawing on experiences from three leading offshore oil and gas producers (Norway, the UK, and the US), we recommend the adoption of three best practices: the UK's 'safety case' approach (where operators are expected to provide convincing and valid arguments that a system is sufficiently safe for a given application in a specific environment), Norway's 'barrier management' (evidence that there are at least two tested and independent barriers to avoid accidents) and greater investment in safety research and development, as suggested by the US's National Commission on the BP Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill and Offshore Drilling.

The trial was carried out at the Shell Flats area off Blackpool, and aimed to satisfy five objectives. The outcome of this trial is assessed against its objectives as follows: Demonstrate the ability of the technique to reliably survey the more sensitive species of waterbird, such as common scoter or red throated diver. A large number of common scoter were encountered. When observed from 600m, the birds showed no signs of awareness of the aircraft. Indeed, Blackpool air traffic control notified the survey aircraft of several other aircraft in the vicinity at a similar altitude, and even required that the survey be halted at one point to make way for a large jet. If aircraft at this altitude disturb birds then a revision of survey methodology at areas near large airports would be required. When flying at 210m, the birds were clearly aware of the aircraft, but the vast majority remained on the water at the point of encounter. Only a very small number of birds were observed in the air or taking flight. It appears that if the survey altitude is kept at 270m or more, Scoter will not take flight as a result of the survey aircraft. It is therefore recommended that 270m be adopted in future as the minimum survey altitude. Compare the output of the technique with data from other surveys to provide insight into the performance of the technique. Some comparison has been made with historic data from the 2004/5 surveys undertaken for BERR (formerly the DTI) and with four datasets generated by WWT between 2004 and 2007. These show very good agreement in terms of the spatial distribution of birds, with the same key feeding locations and seasonal behaviours identified across all data sets. Comparison of overall population reveals that our estimated population (7000 birds) is somewhat less than those from the WWT surveys (15000-16000). However, this is not seen as a reason for concern, partly as there are good reasons to expect the estimate to be lower in our case, and also because the way in which we have analysed the WWT data is likely to be generating an over-estimate of the population. It is proposed that consistency of the data, the quality of the video and the relative statistical simplicity of our method, coupled with its intrinsic advantages for surveying built windfarms justify its use along side existing techniques as a mainstream tool for environmental data gathering and analysis. To undertake a trial on a statistically significant scale, to demonstrate the consistency of the technique and the usefulness of the data. An area of 226 sq. km has been surveyed at a coverage density of 12%. A total of 823 birds were observed, 785 of which were 'on transect' with a further 38 observed between transects. This provides a suitably large observed population for statistical analysis. The format of the data permits straightforward population and distribution analysis by well established statistical methods. A particular benefit is the ability to perform local rather than global statistical normalisation, which could potentially increase the power of local population variation analysis. While this is particularly relevant to species which form localised clusters around static features such as cockle beds, in principle the scale of analysis can be varied to suit the distribution and behaviour of any species. In particular, it will be relevant in the future to tune the scale of analysis to the scale of a given windfarm in order to assess the likelihood that a significant alteration in bird population and/or distribution has occurred. Investigation of the potential performance of such a technique will be explored further using methods comparable to those described in Ref. 8. Demonstrate the feasibility of an aeroplane rather than a helicopter as the survey vehicle. As expected, the aeroplane was well suited to the task, providing a more stable platform, a quieter more comfortable environment for the operators, using less fuel, and costing significantly less per hour (excluding international ferry flights). Unlike visual observer methods, a large number of twin engine aircraft are suitable for this form of surveying, and can be put into service with only minor interior modifications. To test the technical refinements proposed as a result of the first trial. The recommended techniques for control of focus, image size and contrast were implemented and found to result in a significant improvement in video quality overall. In particular setting of contrast for bright whites rather than midtones was found to be highly beneficial. Control of focus still presents some difficulties over flat seas, and focus would preferably be capable of being fixed in a dedicated survey aircraft. Similarly, zoom and camera attitude could be locked without an adverse impact on the survey quality, which would considerably reduce the burden on the operator. Indeed, this would probably be a necessity for a multi-camera system controlled by a single operator. The target image width of 30m metres identified during the first trial was found to be pessimistic; the increased image quality resulting from the other technical refinements was sufficient to enable an increase of image width to 40m while still maintaining an overall improvement in quality. This adjustment confers a 30% increase in coverage rate.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,978-0-9557501-3-7,,,,,,,,,"HiDef Aerial Surveying Ltd, c/o REACT, Fleswick Court, Westlakes Science and Technology Park, Whitehaven, Cumbria, CA24 3HZ, United Kingdom",,,,2008-01-01,ZOOREC:ZOOR14503017838,,

The long-term consequences of such intensive harvest are unclear, particularly as forests face novel climatic conditions over the next century. We used a simulation model to project the long-term effects of management and climate change on above- and belowground forest carbon storage in a watershed in northwestern Oregon. The multi-ownership watershed has a diverse range of current management practices, including little-to-no harvesting on federal lands, short-rotation clear-cutting on industrial land, and a mix of practices on private nonindustrial land. We simulated multiple management scenarios, varying the rate and intensity of harvest, combined with projections of climate change. Our simulations project a wide range of total ecosystem carbon storage with varying harvest rate, ranging from a 45% increase to a 16% decrease in carbon compared to current levels. Increasing the intensity of harvest for bioenergy caused a 2-3% decrease in ecosystem carbon relative to conventional harvest practices. Soil carbon was relatively insensitive to harvest rotation and intensity, and accumulated slowly regardless of harvest regime. Climate change reduced carbon accumulation in soil and detrital pools due to increasing heterotrophic respiration, and had small but variable effects on aboveground live carbon and total ecosystem carbon. Overall, we conclude that current levels of ecosystem carbon storage are maintained in part due to substantial portions of the landscape (federal and some private lands) remaining unharvested or lightly managed.Increasing the intensity of harvest for bioenergy on currently harvested land, however,led to a relatively small reduction in the ability of forests to store carbon.

Although fungi, and the related Opisthosporidia, interact with photosynthetic organisms on land and in freshwater as parasites, symbionts, and/or saprotrophic degraders [1, 2], such interactions in the marine environment are poorly understood [3-8]. One newly identified uncultured marine lineage has been named novel chytrid-like-clade-1 (NCLC1) [ 4] or basal-clone-group-I [5, 6]. We use ribosomal RNA (rRNA) encoding gene phylogenies to demonstrate that NCLC1 is a distinct branch within the Opisthosporidia (Holomycota) [7]. Opisthosporidia are a diverse and largely uncultured group that form a sister branch to the Fungi or, alternatively, the deepest branch within the Fungi, depending on how the boundary to this kingdom is inferred [9]. Using culture-free lineage-specific rRNA-targeted fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) microscopy, we demonstrate that NCLC1 cells form intracellular infection of key diatom species, establishing that intracellular colonization of a eukaryotic host is a consistent lifestyle across the Opisthosporidia [8-11]. NCLC1 infection-associated loss and/or envelopment of the diatom nuclei infers a necrotrophic-pathogenic interaction. Diatoms are one of the most diverse and ecologically important phytoplankton groups, acting as dominant primary producers and driving carbon fixation and storage in many aquatic environments [12-14]. Our results provide insight into the diversity of microbial eukaryotes that interact with diatoms. We suggest that such interactions can play a key role in diatom associated ecosystem functions, such as the marine carbon pump through necrotrophic-parasitism, facilitating the export of diatoms to the sediment [15, 16].",,,,,,,,,15,0,0,0,15,0,17,,,0960-9822,1879-0445,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Brest, CNRS, IRD, Ifremer,LEMAR, F-29280 Plouzane, FranceUniv Exeter, Sch Biosci, Living Syst Inst, Exeter EX4 4QD, Devon, EnglandDalhousie Univ, Fac Comp Sci, Halifax, NS B3H 4R2, CanadaUniv Miami, Rosenstiel Sch Marine & Atmospher Sci, Miami, FL 33149 USAUniv Bretagne Occidentale, Plateforme Imagerie & Mesures Microscopie, F-29200 Brest, FranceUniv Oslo, Dept Biosci, Sect Aquat Biol & Toxicol, POB 1066 Blindern, N-0316 Oslo, Norway",,,,2019-12-12,WOS:000499948700030,31735677,

Since the maximum CO2 concentration that is reached depends on the horizontal shape of the water column and the depths of release, it is very important to optimize these parameters for each injection site in order to minimize the biological impact. We conducted numerical experiments using an offline Oceanic General Circulation Model with a horizontal resolution of 0.1 degree x 0.1 degree. Experiments using a different horizontal site shape show that a site elongated in the meridional direction is effective to reduce the CO2 concentration. This is because CO2 has a tendency to be transported in a zonal direction. Optimization of the vertical distribution of CO2 injections is inherently determined by the balance of the following two factors; (1) dilution effect by eddy activity which decreases with depth, and the (2) predicted no effect concentration (PNEC), a criterion concentration causing no effect on biota, which increases with depth. Based on superposition of simulated CO2 concentration, we determined the optimized vertical distribution of CO2 injection which keeps the ratio of a simulated maximum CO2 concentration to PNEC constant.",,,,,,,,,0,3,0,0,1,0,4,,,0948-4280,1437-8213,,,,,,,,,,"Hokkaido Univ, Fac Environm Earth Sci, Kita Ku, Sapporo, Hokkaido 0600810, JapanSci & Technol Agcy JST, Creat Technol Seeds Responding Social Demands CRE, Tokyo 1020075, JapanJapan Agcy Marine Earth Sci & Technol JAMSTEC, Kanazawa Ku, Yokohama, Kanagawa 2360001, Japan",,,,2013-07-03,WOS:000319575200007,,

The technique is routinely used both sub-sea and topside fbr structural weld inspection and is capable of both detecting and sizing surface-breaking cracks, PETROBRAS, the Brazilian State Oil Company, has recently introduced ACFM inspection as part of their routine structural inspection programmes for their offshore platforms. This has produced excellent results during both laboratory tests and experimental field services, carried out during the past two years in Brazil. The main field application of the technique has been underwater inspection of structural welds on both fixed and floating offshore platforms. Compared to conventional inspection methods, employing magnetic particle inspection (MPI), the use of ACFM has resulted in substantial cost savings allied with improvements in inspection reliability.When introducing a new inspection technique, it is necessary to consider many aspects and to evaluate the capabilities of the technique in the laboratory prior to implementation off shore. It is also necessary to properly consider the development and evaluation of appropriate inspection procedures and the training of personnel. This paper describes the ACFM method and how: it has been applied to subsea structural weld inspection in Brazil. It also considers the requirements for introducing new inspection technology into a major oil company and the need for cross-comparison with existing: inspection methods. The requirements for the development of operator training and certification schemes are also considered and the approach adopted bp PETROBRAS to these challenges explained.

Data are presented separately for large whales (those subject to commercial whaling) and smaller cetaceans, and are separated by era and ocean basin.

In the vast majority of cases, parametric resonance is studied by means of simplified analytical models, considering only two degrees of freedom (DoFs) of archetypical geometries, while neglecting collateral complexity of ancillary systems. On the contrary, this paper implements a representative 7-DoF nonlinear hydrodynamic model of the full complexity of a realistic spar buoy wave energy converter, which is used to verify the likelihood of parametric instability, quantify the severity of the parametrically excited response and evaluate its consequences on power conversion efficiency.

At the pressures and temperature found below 3 km of seawater, CO2 becomes denser than seawater and so is likely to remain permanently sequestered in the sediment. Deepwater engineering, however, is expensive and seawater depths of greater than 3 km are often only reached far from shore. Here, we consider the less expensive alternative of injecting CO2 into marine sediments at depths shallower than required for denser-than-seawater CO2 storage. We compare the mobility of liquid CO2 that has been injected into deep-sea reservoirs with the mobility of supercritical CO2 that has been injected into geologically equivalent (i.e., identical porosity, permeability, and effective stress) reservoirs with terrestrial pressure and temperature conditions. We demonstrate that buoyant liquid CO2 with a density of about 90% that of seawater is sufficiently immobile that it can be considered trapped by gravity and capillarity. In contrast, supercritical CO2 under typical terrestrial conditions is highly mobile and only trapped by the appropriate confining layer in either a structural or stratigraphic trap. As a result of its very high mobility under terrestrial conditions, CO2 injected in an unconfined formation would spread beneath the confining layer to produce a large flat cylindrical-shaped plume of pure-phase CO2. In contrast, the less mobile CO2 in a typical deep-sea reservoir produces a spherical-shaped plume, resulting in a pure-phase-CO2 footprint that is much smaller than the pure-phase-CO2 footprint formed in the confined-terrestrial reservoir.",,,,,,,,,12,1,0,0,3,0,13,,,1864-5631,1864-564X,,,,,,,,,,"MIT, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Cambridge, MA 02139 USASchlumberger Doll Res Ctr, Cambridge, MA 02139 USAHarvard Univ, Dept Earth & Planetary Sci, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",,,,2010-01-01,WOS:000281662400013,20687053,

In this report, a case study from the waters of the South China Sea is presented, and multidimensional scaling analysis (MDS) is introduced to demonstrate how oil fingerprints can be combined with mathematical methods to identify the source of spilled oil from highly similar suspected sources.

Field observational studies provide an unparalleled capability to undertake ecologically realistic research, although their practical challenges must be considered during research planning.

Firstly, the energy saving assessment is comprised of energy consumption decline on certain period, energy elasticity decline for a certain period and energy intensity decline percentage. Secondly, the financial capability constitutes of minimum cost, payback period and optimize timetable. Thirdly, environment sustainability is grouped into minimize environmental pollution, renewable resources and fuel reserve. Finally, the human resources is developed by management, technical skill and enforcement.

The aim of this study is to provoke discussion on the development of an effective and coordinated petroleum EEM program structure for the offshore of Nova Scotia, Canada. A structure that supports development of a national EEM program for the petroleum industry is then proposed. Advantages of a coordinated EEM program structure include: (1) reduced cost of the EEM; (2) fewer gaps and less overlapping of responsibilities; (3) fewer calculated risks to the marine environment; and (4) improved environmental safeguards.

Many are in deep water and are correspondingly large, with the largest, Harmony, in 1200 feet of water and weighing approximately 43 000 tons. Nearly 30% of California's platforms are in water depths that exceed those of any previous decommissioning project anywhere in the world. Decommissioning will involve the operation of diesel-powered heavy equipment for long periods in virtually all phases of the operation (e.g, at the platform, in transit to and from the platform, in port, at offloading, salvage, and recycling facilities) in a region where air quality is a crucial concern for state, federal, and local regulatory agencies, as well as the public. To support future decision making about the choice between decommissioning options, we consider potential air emissions generated under complete and partial (removal to 85 feet below water line) removal options. We describe major emissions categories, and the environmental and human health issues associated with each, and examine how the regulatory system would operate in specific projects. We then describe methods to estimate emissions for a worst-case example involving the largest platform, Harmony. We estimate that complete versus partial removal of Harmony would result, respectively, in 600 or 89 tons of NOx, 50 or 7 tons of carbon monoxide, 29 400 or 4400 tons of CO2, 21 or 3 tons of PM10, and 20 or 3 tons of PM2.5. Complete removal of Harmony's jacket and topsides creates approximately 6.75 times more air pollution than partial removal down to 85 feet below the sea surface. We discuss how the Harmony estimate can be used as a baseline to roughly estimate emissions from decommissioning other platforms, using expected time on station for the major categories of decommissioning equipment.

Fixed assets represent machinery, equipment and constructions, which are utilized in the life cycle of products to enable their production and use. Subject matter is the set-up of an input-output model to implement fixed assets, followed by a methodological analysis of the approach and structural analysis of the determined coefficients. The study is based on an input-output model in hybrid units, which measures nine energetic transactions in energetic units and 64 other transactions in monetary units. An environmental extension takes renewable energies and greenhouse gases into account. Specific cumulative energy demands and emissions are determined. Fixed assets are implemented by either the augmentation method or the matrix flow method. Energetic and ecologic coefficients rise by 20-30 % on average, and in particular for services, if fixed assets are considered. Applying these coefficients to a life cycle assessment of an offshore wind farm indicates about 12% higher values for the energy demand and emissions. The augmentation method is easy to implement and delivers approximately the same energetic coefficients for fixed assets, compared to the matrix flow method. For a holistic analysis, the significant additional energy demand and emissions for fixed assets have to be included in life cycle assessments. In particular, the indirect share and especially machinery and equipment have to be considered. Recommendations on the modeling, as well as coefficients for fixed assets, to be implemented in future life cycle assessments, are delivered. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Current uncertainties on the fate of carbon stocks following the loss or revegetation of seagrass meadows prevent the deployment of blue carbon' strategies. Here, we reconstruct the trajectories of carbon stocks associated with one of the longest monitored seagrass restoration projects globally. We demonstrate that sediment carbon stocks erode following seagrass loss and that revegetation projects effectively restore seagrass carbon sequestration capacity. We combine carbon chronosequences with Pb-210 dating of seagrass sediments in a meadow that experienced losses until the end of 1980s and subsequent serial revegetation efforts. Inventories of excess Pb-210 in seagrass sediments revealed that its accumulation, and thus sediments, coincided with the presence of seagrass vegetation. They also showed that the upper sediments eroded in areas that remained devoid of vegetation after seagrass loss. Seagrass revegetation enhanced autochthonous and allochthonous carbon deposition and burial. Carbon burial rates increased with the age of the restored sites, and 18years after planting, they were similar to that in continuously vegetated meadows (26.40.8 gC(org) m(-2)year(-1)).Synthesis. The results presented here demonstrate that loss of seagrass triggers the erosion of historic carbon deposits and that revegetation effectively restores seagrass carbon sequestration capacity.

Calibrated water clarity observations from 1949 to 1954 reinforce the results indicating a progressive shoaling. For the inshore area, 150 km off the coast, Secchi disk has shoaled 8.4 +/- 1.2 m since 1949. This change has been accompanied by a nitracline shoaling of 18.2 +/- 6.4 m since 1969 and an increase in chlorophyll a since 1978. These changes have occurred despite an increase in density stratification in the CCS. Increased stratification has been linked by others to decreased nutrient fluxes, reduced primary production, increased water transparency, and a deepening of the euphotic zone, contrary to our findings. We explore this apparent paradox with a simple steady-state model of the thickness of the euphotic zone. A sensitivity analysis suggests that the observed shoaling of the euphotic zone is consistent with a doubling in nutrient upwelling, but in this analysis we also consider alternative causes for such shoaling: water-column darkening caused by freshening, increased residence time of the phototrophic biomass in the euphotic zone, and supply of nutrients of anthropogenic origin.",,,,,,,,,53,0,0,0,28,0,62,,,0024-3590,,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Bergen, Dept Biol, Bergen, NorwayUniv Calif San Diego, Scripps Inst Oceanog, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA",,,,2009-07-01,WOS:000268325100020,,

The contactor gives significantly lower values of H-OL. These, combined with the much higher liquid fluxes, give volumetric mass transfer coefficients, K(L)a, several hundred times higher than those for the packed column and substantially higher than those in the literature for bubble columns. Performance is particularly good on saline water due to suppression of bubble coalescence. That characteristic would be beneficial in the removal of aromatics from produced water in oil and gas production. The contactor utilizes enhanced acceleration fields achieved by water injection and so should be insensitive to the marine motion and tilt experienced on offshore floating production systems, as well as being compact.At constant water rate, K(L)a proportional to G(n) with n ranging from 0.50 to 0.92.

Correspondingly, a series of major breakthroughs have been obtained and a number of large oil and gas fields have been found. After the breakthroughs of Kaijiang-Liangping trough, how reef-bank exploration will proceed? Is there another Kaijiang-Liangping trough in Sichuan basin? Previous research shows that Sichuan basin underwent intracratonic rift and basement fault activities in Late Permian, developing a paleogeography framework of three uplifts and three depressions under the background of the regional large ramp, including Exi (e,eyen)-Chengkou (aYZa ) pound trough, Kaijiang-Liangping trough and Yanting (c > a(0))-Tongnan (ae1/21/4aiu) trough. Based on sedimentology and tectonics dynamics analysis, data of drillings, outcrops and seismic, Yanting-Tongnan trough has been discovered in central Sichuan basin in our study which distributes from Mianzhu (c >>mu c <<(1)), Jiangyou (ae +/- Yae(21)) in western Sichuan basin through Nanchong (aiua......) to Guang'an (a(1)a (R)parts per thousand), as long as about 210 km, extending in NW-SE nearly paralleling to Kaijiang-Liangping trough, opening to the sea north-westward, and gradually pinchout to the east platform. Similar to Kaijiang-Liangping trough, another platform margin reef belt distributes along a U-shape belt around Yanting-Tongnan trough, which is expected to become another natural gas accumulation zone after the platform margin around Kaijiang-Liangping trough. The discovery of Yanting-Tongnan trough expands favorable reef exploration area from original 2x10(4) km(2) on both sides of Kaijiang-Liangping trough to more than 6x10(4) km(2) in Yanting-Tongnan trough platform margin belt and Kaijiang-Liangping platform margin belt, greatly enlarging the reef exploration field. But compared to Kaijiang-Liangping trough, Yanting-Tongnan trough is relatively shallower and smaller, and the scale and quality of reef-bank reservoirs in its margin belt is a little poor relatively. Therefore, much research should be done timely such as comparative study of two troughs, detailed research of formation and evolution of the trough, regularity of reef migration, meticulous depiction of reef-bank reservoir size and distribution in order to obtain major breakthroughs around the Yanting-Tongnan trough.",,,,,,,,,4,7,0,0,0,0,9,,,1674-487X,1867-111X,,,,,,,,,,"China Univ Geosci, Coll Energy Resources, Beijing 100083, Peoples R ChinaPetroChina, Res Inst Petr Explorat & Dev, Beijing 100083, Peoples R ChinaCNOOC Res Inst, Beijing 100027, Peoples R China",,,,2012-10-03,WOS:000307266400015,,

This technique stemmed the spilled oil well (Macondo) in 2010 Deepwater Horizon blowout accident. However, few efforts have been devoted to studying the way to efficiently and safely conduct the operation of capping stack. In this paper, program evaluation and review technique (PERT) was employed to quantitatively design the operation procedure of capping stack. A mechanical model was established to determine the configuration scheme of capping stack. And a sensitivity analysis of operational factors of capping stack was conducted through orthogonal tests. Experimental results recommend to optimize the operation process by reducing the working time of diamond cutting tool down-pass, Lower Marine Riser Package (LMRP) upper riser incision, LMRP and original Blowout Preventer (BOP) separation, and LMRP recovery, in order to guarantee that the whole operation can be completed as scheduled. The results show that the number of ram BOPS has little effect on the equivalent stress of conductors. To improve system reliability, a five-ram capping stack is recommended to be applied in the defined accident scenario. The maximum equivalent stress of conductors rates the drilling vessel offset as the primary factor, followed by shut-in pressure, ocean current and top tension. The drilling vessel offset needs to be given the priority control and the shut-in pressure should be jointly monitored.",,,,,,,,,11,0,0,0,0,0,11,,,0950-4230,1873-3352,,,,,,,,,,"Tsinghua Univ, Dept Ind Engn, Beijing, Peoples R ChinaChina Univ Petr East China, Ctr Offshore Engn & Safety Technol, Qingdao, Shandong, Peoples R China",,,,2019-12-24,WOS:000501613500009,,

A method for preventing such accidents is to deploy intelligent monitoring tools which continuously supervise the process and the health of equipments to provide context-specific decision support to operators during safety-critical situations. A dynamic model of an offshore oil and gas production platform was developed using gPROMS and data to reflect operating conditions under normal, fault conditions and maintenance activities were simulated. These data are used to train three monitoring algorithms based on multivariate statistics (Principal Component Analysis), two of which are specialized in monitoring certain sections of the platform. These multivariate monitoring algorithms are considered as individual agents and the results produced by each are then integrated using a multi-agent collaborative framework.

Considering coastal plant diversity at the species and community levels, and their vulnerability to three main potential hazards threatening coastal areas (oil spills, Hazardous and Noxious Substances pollution, fragmentation of natural habitats), the objective of this paper is to define an easy-to-use approach to locate and prioritize the areas more susceptible to those stressors, in order to have a practical instrument for risk management in the ordinary and extra-ordinary management of the coastline. The procedure has been applied at pilot areas in four Mediterranean countries (Italy, France, Lebanon and Tunisia).

Interviews and structured questionnaires indicated varying levels of beliefs, concerns and behaviours based on distance of the village from the swamp, gender and type of livelihood the respondent engaged in. Villagers who lived in closer proximity to the swamp demonstrated the greatest health and environmental concerns, pro-environmental beliefs and behaviours, probably due to their greater dependence on the resource for livelihoods. Females illustrated a higher affinity for altruistic and egoistic concerns, while males, engaged in outdoor employment and recreational opportunities, demonstrated greater biospheric concerns and environmental behaviours. Given their intimacy with the natural environment, farmers engaged in environmental behaviours to a greater extent than other groups within the villages.

Environmental DNA provides a useful tool for determining species presence in such challenging places to access and sample. Moreover, recent studies showing a link between eDNA concentration and fish density/biomass reveal the great promise for eDNA tools to improve biodiversity assessments in marine environments. Three mesocosm experiments were conducted to assess the accuracy and precision of a hand-held point-of-need (PoN) tool for quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) assay for eDNA detection of striped bass (Morone saxatilis) versus conventional laboratory-based eDNA techniques. The first of these experiments determined that striped bass eDNA was reliably detected using either of the laboratory-based or PoN platforms, with some variation observed in the estimates of eDNA concentrations derived from each. Next, a time series experiment established that eDNA in water samples collected within a 24-hour period of exposure to striped bass was reliably and consistently detectable with either platform. Our final experiment found that the relationship between eDNA concentrations and manipulated striped bass stocking densities was significant and positive based on results from each of the laboratory-based or PoN platforms. Our results validate and advance eDNA approaches towards environmental monitoring efforts and demonstrate the potential for real-time eDNA tools to quantify and identify the spatial and temporal distribution of species-at-risk in an open ocean environment.

Single cells are consumed by ciliates but not copepods, whereas colonies are consumed by copepods but not ciliates. We demonstrate that chemical cues associated with each of these grazers induce consumer-specific, but opposing, morphological transformations in the bloom-forming species Phaeocystis globosa. Chemical cues from grazing copepods suppress colony formation by a significant 60-90%, a response that should be adaptive because copepods feed four times more on colonies versus solitary cells. In contrast, chemical cues from grazing ciliates enhance colony formation by >25%, a response that should be adaptive because ciliates grow three times faster when fed solitary cells versus colonies.

In the present paper, we describe the results obtained with caged mussels, Mytilus galloprovincialis, chosen as bioindicator organisms to detect variations of bioavailability and the early onset of molecular and cellular effects (biomarkers). Seven translocation experiments were carried out during the first year from the incident, with organisms deployed at 2 depths in 3 different sites. After 4-6 weeks, tissue concentrations were measured for the main classes of potentially released chemicals (trace metals, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, volatile and aliphatic hydrocarbons, polychlorinated biphenyls, halogenated pesticides, organotin compounds, brominated flame retardants, anionic surfactants); a wide battery of biomarkers covered responses indicative of exposure, detoxification, oxidative stress, cell damage and genotoxic effects. Results excluded serious contamination events or a consistent increase of environmental pollution although some episodic spills with reversible effects were detected. Data were elaborated within a quantitative weight of evidence (WOE) model which provided synthetic hazard indices for each typology of data, before their overall integration in an environmental risk index, which generally ranged from slight to moderate. The proposed WOE model was confirmed a useful tool to summarize large datasets of complex data in integrative indices, and to simplify the interpretation for stakeholders and decision makers, thus supporting a more comprehensive process of site-oriented management decisions.

J,,,,,,,,,Derek Fabel,,BRITICE-CHRONO,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Awarded Grant,Nov 01 2012,2012,"Recent satellite measurements of the Earth's polar ice sheets highlight that changes in ice extent and thickness are occurring at rates far higher than expected. The challenge for researchers is to place these observations into a longer-term context and produce computer models ('ice sheet forecasts') that reliably predict the fate of ice sheets over this century and beyond. Although remote from habitation, the polar ice sheets influence global sea level. Retreat by increased melting and iceberg calving produces higher sea levels and concerns exist that sea level may rise by metres displacing many millions of people, and their livelihoods, from their coastal homes. At this point in time, it is not possible to study the full life cycle of the present Antarctic or Greenland ice sheets as they are still evolving and undergoing large-scale changes. Instead, we will use an ice sheet that has now fully retreated; the ice sheet that covered most of Britain, Ireland and the North Sea during the last ice age. The last British-Irish ice sheet covered up to 1,000,000 km2 at its maximum size, around 25,000 yrs ago, and was relatively small by global standards. However, its character, setting and behaviour have striking parallels with both the modern West Antarctic and Greenland Ice Sheets. Large parts of the British-Irish Ice Sheet were marine-influenced just like in west Antarctica today; and numerous fast-flowing ice streams carried much of its mass, just like in the Greenland Ice Sheet today. All three are or were highly dynamic, in climatically sensitive regions, with marine sectors, ocean-terminating margins and land-based glaciers. All these common factors make the British-Irish Ice Sheet a powerful analogue for understanding ice sheet dynamics on a range of timescales, operating now and in the future.Recent work by members of this consortium has revealed the pattern of ice sheet retreat that once covered the British Isles, as recorded by end moraines and other glacial landforms. Other work by members of this consortium has used sophisticated computer models to simulate the ice sheet's response to climate change at the end of the last Ice Age. However, these models can only be as good as the geological data on which they are based, and the pattern is poorly constrained in time. We need to know more about the style, rate and timing of ice sheet decay in response to past climate change. Such knowledge allows us to further refine computer modelling so that better predictions can be made. The main focus of the project therefore, is to collect sediments and rocks deposited by the last ice sheet that covered the British Isles, and use these, along with organic remains, to date (e.g. by radiocarbon analyses) the retreat of the ice sheet margins. The project will use over 200 carefully chosen sites, dating some 800 samples in order to achieve this. Offshore, samples will be extracted using coring devices lowered from a research ship to the seabed, and onshore by manual sampling and by use of small drilling rigs. Once the samples are dated and added to the pattern information provided by the landforms, maps of the shrinking ice sheet will be produced. These will provide crucial information on the timing and rates of change across the whole ice sheet. The British-Irish Ice Sheet will become the best constrained anywhere in the world and be the benchmark against which ice sheet models are improved and tested in the future.Knowledge on the character and age of the seafloor sediments surrounding the British Isles is also useful for many industrial, archaeological and heritage applications. Accordingly, the project is closely linked to partners interested, for example, in locating offshore windfarms, electricity cables between Britain and Ireland, and heritage bodies aiming to preserve offshore archaeological remains.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,NE/J008729/1,,,,,,,,University of Glasgow,,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:15376581,,

This paper presents a modeling study for evaluating the tidal energy extraction and its potential impacts on the marine environment in a real world site - Tacoma Narrows of Puget Sound, Washington State, USA. An unstructured-grid coastal ocean model, fitted with a module that simulates tidal energy devices, was applied to simulate the tidal energy extracted by different turbine array configurations and the potential effects of the extraction at local and system-wide scales in Tacoma Narrows and South Puget Sound. Model results demonstrated the advantage of an unstructured-grid model for simulating the far-field effects of tidal energy extraction in a large model domain, as well as assessing the near-field effect using a fine grid resolution near the tidal turbines. The outcome shows that a realistic near-term deployment scenario extracts a very small fraction of the total tidal energy in the system and that system wide environmental effects are not likely; however, there are near-field effects on the flow field and bed shear stress in the area of tidal turbine farm. Model results also indicate that from a practical standpoint, hydrodynamic or water quality effects are not likely to be the limiting factor for development of large commercial-scale tidal farms. Results indicate that very high numbers of turbines are required to significantly alter the tidal system; limitations on marine space or other environmental concerns are likely to be reached before reaching these deployment levels. These findings show that important information obtained from numerical modeling can be used to inform regulatory and policy processes for tidal energy development. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

The physical properties of CO2, specifically the vapor liquid equilibrium properties of CO2, are such that the design of a storage tank for the containment of liquid carbon dioxide is very similar to existing designs for intermediate pressure liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) containment systems. The design methodology for LPG cargo tanks is well understood and is regulated by international standards (specifically the International Code for the Construction and Equipment of Ships Carrying Liquefied Gases in Bulk; IGC code) and Classification Societies (such as DNV, BV and LRS). The design methodology employed in this study. which is for the marine transport of LCO2 is exactly the same as described by the 1GC code and subject to Classification Society rules. These design rules are well proven with literally hundreds of LPG carriers operating worldwide in an industry that has an excellent safety record since the advent of LPG bulk marine transport in the early 1960s. The proposed ship design which installs two cargo tanks was as follows:- the volume of the tanks is about 1500 m(3) and design pressure and temperature are 3.10 MPa and mums 10 degC, respectively.- The shape of the tanks is a cylindrical bilobe with single cylinder radius of 3.50 in and 26.96 m in lengthThe necessary facilities for LCO2 loading from land-based storage tanks are also examined, including CO2 buffer storage tanks, the loading pumps, the loading arms, and so on. The offshore delivery and injection system are investigated and the resultant design proposal was as follows: the temperature of the cargo LCO, is raised to 5 degC by on-board heat exchange system using the ambient seawater.The cost estimate of the proposed system will be also given in the presentation.The study is a part of the Preliminary Feasibility Study on CO2 Carrier for Ship-based CCS and its follow-up study sponsored by Global CCS Institute and conducted by Chiyoda Corporation.

Common targets include mines, wreck debris, and fishing hardware. The prime reason that traditional towed side scan technology is used for this, is its capability of maintaining the sonar close to the seabed thereby imaging using low (even limiting) grazing angles. The target cannot be relied on to have distinctive backscatter strength (wrt the surrounding seabed) but usually lies proud of the seabed, thus casting a shadow. Such technology fails at higher grazing angles where shadows are no longer cast. Thus repetitive, overlapping survey geometries are required to fill the ''nadir gap''. An alternate technology that can detect topographic anomalies without relying on shadows is high frequency multibeam sonars (HFMS). If such systems can be combined with side scan methods, target search times can be considerably reduced.Traditionally HFMS sonars have been hull mounted (for use in hydrographic applications) and thus are not able to resolve smalt (<1.5 m) targets in continental shelf mater depths (30-200 m). If such sonars were deployed on tow bodies however, small target detection at high grazing angles may be feasible. To this end, we have investigated the capability of one of these sonars using altitudes between 10 and 30 m (as might be achieved by mounting such a sonar on a terrain-following tow fish). Our preliminary modelling suggests that the beam footprints (using 1.5 degree beam) and the beam sounding density are potentially sufficient to achieve the required objective.We identified two principal limiting conditions: the method of bottom detection within a beam; and the sounding density. The first condition depends on the type of bottom detection algorithm used, the beam width and side lobe levels. The second condition depends on a number of factors including pulse repetition rate, beams' angular spacing, sonar body speed, and active motion compensation.We compared the results of our modelling with actual data taken from a small survey launch in water depths between 10 and 30 m using targets ranging in size from a few decimetres to 1.5 metres. The data was collected in a variety of rob, pitch and heaving conditions at speeds ranging from 3.5 to 10.5 knots.",,,,,Oceans 97 MTS/IEEE ConferenceOceans 97 MTS/IEEE Conference,"OCT 06-09, 1997OCT 06-09, 1997",IEEE Ocean Engn Soc; Marine Technol SocIEEE Ocean Engn Soc; Marine Technol Soc,"HALIFAX, CANADAHALIFAX, CANADA",2,0,0,0,0,0,2,,,,,0-7803-4108-2,,,,,,,,,,,,,1997-01-01,WOS:A1997BJ68T00145,,

Such developments draw attention to the intellectual history of ocean industrialization, its driving forces, and related environmental thought. This article examines the intellectual origins of ecomodernism and similar green growth strategies. Using an oceanic perspective and placing the ideas of Japanese star architect and Metabolist movement member Kiyonori Kikutake and US ocean expert John P. Craven at its center, this article argues that their two prototypes of floating industrial combines tested in Hawaii and Okinawa during the early 1970s applied the Japanese Metabolist movement's design principles of mobility, modularity, and plug-in structures to Pacific waters in an effort to decouple ocean industrialization from the destruction of ecosystems. Several of their proto-ecomodernist ideas, born as techno-optimist reactions to neo-Malthusian fears of resource depletion and overpopulation, have become central pillars of ecomodernist thought. As such, their projects turned into the immediate forerunner of current development strategies whose intellectual aim is to continue growth during (or despite) environmental challenges up to the planetary scale.",,,,,,,,,5,0,0,0,0,0,6,,,1084-5453,1930-8892,,,,,,,,,,"Natl Univ Singapore, Asia Res Inst, Singapore, SingaporeHarvard Univ, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",,,,2020-06-12,WOS:000536415900003,,

Identifying cost-effective waste handling practices, which have a minimal environmental footprint, however, is one of the biggest challenges for Arctic offshore industries. The cost and potential risks of drilling waste handling practices in the Arctic offshore operation will differ vastly, depending on the operating environment such as the ice conditions and negative sea temperature. However, in the majority of the available cost-effectiveness and risk analysis literature, the influence of the operating environment on the cost and risk profile has received less attention. Hence, the aim of this paper is to propose a methodology for risk-based cost-effectiveness analysis (RB-CEA) of drilling waste handling practices by considering the complex and fast-changing nature of the Arctic. The central thrust of this paper is to highlight the fact that comparing different alternatives based on the cost elements alone is misleading. The proposed methodology uses risk assessment as a key component for the cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA). The application of the proposed methodology is demonstrated by a case study of the drilling waste handling practices of an oil field in the Barents Sea. The case study results demonstrate that the operating environment causes costs to be between 1.18 and 1.52 times greater, depending on the type of practices and operating season, in the Arctic offshore compared with the North Sea. Further, the risk of undesirable events is between 1.48 and 2.60 times greater during waste handling activities under Arctic operational conditions.",,,,,,,,,7,0,0,0,0,0,7,,,0892-7219,1528-896X,,,,,,,,,,"UiT Arctic Univ Norway, Dept Engn & Safety, N-9037 Tromso, NorwayUniv Chile, Dept Mech Engn, Santiago 8370448, Chile",,,,2016-06-08,WOS:000375922900003,,

We observed oil degradation under all pressure conditions tested [0.1, 15, and 30 megapascals (MPa)], although oil degradation profiles, cell numbers, and hydrocarbon degradation gene abundances indicated greatest activity at atmospheric pressure. Under all incubations the growth of psychrophilic bacteria was promoted. Bacteria closely related to Oleispira antarctica RB-8 dominated the communities at all pressures. At 30 MPa we observed a shift toward Photobacterium, a genus that includes piezophiles.

With production assets no longer concentrated in the hands of a few major operators, the question is whether this leadership role can be assured in the future. This paper aims to summarise doctoral research that examined the economics of safety in the offshore helicopter industry.Design/methodology/approach - The offshore helicopter industry has particular characteristics, including: greater levels of safety training and choice is severely limited. A carefully structured questionnaire was presented to a sample of offshore helicopter passengers, and the responses analysed in depth.Findings - Shifts in perceptions of safety risk are predictable, and potentially measurable, and translate into demands for action based on a mechanism of individual choice. It is then the cumulative effects of any shift in individual choices that determine the scale and scope of organisational response required by the employer and/or its agents.Research limitations/implications - This research data is only sufficient to predict the manner in which perceptions of safety impact on the sustainability of offshore helicopter travel.Originality/value - The fundamental characteristics and dynamics of offshore helicopter travel still have the potential to result in some significant instability amongst the offshore workforce, and within the industry.

Here we assess historical data of sea surface temperature and sea level pressure, along with nearly a decade of biogeochemical float data to evaluate the impact of these warm events on organic carbon production. The first stratified winter experienced little apparent impact on the magnitude of net organic carbon production in the growing season relative to prior years, suggesting an immediate resilience from reduced new nutrients, apparently depending on recycled iron. However, the subsequent winter experienced virtually zero net production; a loss of resilience, perhaps due to net iron removal with export, was evident. We find that consistently enhanced winter stratification decreased carbon production much more so than a single warm winter.

It is promising to use the hydrocarbon seepage phenomenon of sea-floor hydrocarbon reservoirs to predict hydrocarbon potentials in sea areas. In order to provide geophysical evidence for hydrocarbon prospect evaluation and further locating of target areas in the basin, we use the magnetic exploration method, one of the most economical and efficient geophysical methods of discriminating hydrocarbon seepage anomalies, and propose a supervised-learning-based pattern recognition method for recognizing magnetic anomalies related to sea-floor hydrocarbon-seepage alteration zones. Making full of both magnitude and textural features of magnetic anomalies, the method takes three kinds of basic elements (including point, polygonal line, and polygon) and their adjacent grid data cells as basic classes representing known constraint information like oil-encountering drill sites. The patterns or characteristic vectors extracted from the basic classes are used as templates to be matched or studied, and the similarity degrees between anomaly feature vectors and template vectors are calculated with the weighting Euclidean Distance function. In this way, the pattern matching is performed and the anomalies most similar to the templates are thus recognized. We apply the method to delineate alteration-induced aeromagnetic anomaly zones of the North Yellow Sea Basin. From the overlaying result of the anomalous zones with the distribution of Mesozoic strata and some geochemical anomalies (the detection results of anomalous hydrocarbon gases at the lower atmosphere and microbial germs in the subsurface sediments), the method is efficient in recognizing the magnetic anomalies related to alteration zones. The integrated analysis of regional structure, magnetic field, and geochemical anomalies of the study area shows that the seepage alteration-induced anomalous zones located in the eastern and northern part of the area may be promising hydrocarbon prospects in the North Yellow Sea Basin.",,,,,,,,,3,7,0,0,0,0,8,,,0001-5733,,,,,,,,,,,"Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Geol & Geophys, Key Lab Petr Resources, Beijing 100029, Peoples R ChinaChinese Acad Sci, Inst Remote Sensing Applicat, Beijing 100101, Peoples R ChinaGuangzhou Marine Geol Survey, Guangzhou 510075, Guangdong, Peoples R ChinaChina Aero Geophys Survey & Remote Sensing Ctr La, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China",China Aero Geophys Survey & Remote Sensing Ctr La,,,2010-06-01,WOS:000279445500014,,

Understanding the effects of land reclamation on the hydrodynamics and transport processes of a semi-enclosed bay is therefore of significance. From a case study of Deep Bay (DB) in China and referring to idealized bay models, the effects of two types of land reclamation, one that narrows the bay mouth and another that reduces the water area inside the bay, were examined in this study. Simulation results of idealized models show that the current velocity at the bay mouth and the incoming tidal energy flux are negatively correlated with the width of bay mouth, as the tidal prism remains almost constant when the bay mouth width reduces. The bay mouth width reduction would also increase the tidal energy dissipation inside of the bay due to friction increase. In DB, a 30% reduction in the mouth width increased the bay mouth current velocity by up to 5% and the total incoming energy flux by 18%. The narrowed bay mouth also substantially changed the bay's vertical structure of salinity, increasing the stratification strength by 1.7x10(-4) s(-2). For reductions in the water surface area in the head of the bay, results from idealized bay simulations show that the current velocity throughout the bay, the incoming tidal energy flux, and salinity at the inner bay all decrease with water area reduction. Reclaiming 14% of area in DB, the current velocity reduced by 9% at the bay mouth, but increased in the middle and inner parts.

Habitat suitability models are fundamental to developing this understanding; however their use in management continues to be limited due to often-vague model objectives and inadequate evaluation methods. Along the Northeast Pacific coast, canopy kelps (Macrocystis pyrifera and Nereocystis luetkeana) provide biogenic habitat and considerable primary production to nearshore ecosystems. We investigated the distribution of these species by examining a series of increasingly complex habitat suitability models ranging from process-based models based on species' ecology to complex Generalised Additive Models applied to purpose-collected survey data. Seeking limits on model complexity, we explored the relationship between model complexity and forecast skill, measured using both cross-validation and independent data evaluation. Our analysis confirmed the importance of predictors used in models of coastal kelp distributions developed elsewhere (i.e., depth, bottom type, bottom slope, and exposure); it also identified additional important factors including salinity, and interactions between exposure and salinity, and slope and tidal energy. Comparative results showed that cross-validation can lead to over-fitting, while independent data evaluation clearly identified the appropriate model complexity for generating habitat forecasts. Our results also illustrate that, depending on the evaluation data, predictions from simpler models can out-perform those from more complex models. Collectively, the insights from evaluating multiple models with multiple data sets contribute to the holistic assessment of model forecast skill. The continued development of methods and metrics for evaluating model forecasts with independent data, and the explicit consideration of model objectives and assumptions, promise to increase the utility of model forecasts to decision makers. dataGregrEcography_2018Includes: 1) Kelp survey and remote sensing data as csv files; 2) various processed results in RData format.scriptsGregrEcography_2018R scripts for processing and analysing the data.

However, this requirement is often compromised due to incomplete data records, especially when platform abandonment is not properly planned, designed, and/or executed. The availability of multi-source optical and SAR images provides the possibility of a systematic assessment, but the ubiquitous false positives and frequent geocoding errors make it technically challenging. Here, we develop a time-series remote sensing approach (TSRS) for detecting offshore platforms and determining their status, where the technical challenges are overcome using two strategies, as follows: (i) A stepwise optimization strategy applied to individual images and time-series images to mitigate numerous noises, to select platforms from candidates, and to assess platform status; and (ii) A cross geo-correction strategy using platforms derived from high-geometric accuracy images as ground control points to rectify poorly geo-referenced images. We applied the TSRS approach to the northern Gulf of Mexico using about 26,000 moderate resolution optical/SAR images from eight satellites spanning the period from 1982 to 2017. TSRS detected a total of 9260 (5556) platforms in both Federal and State waters, including 3140 (1803) existing platforms, 5044 (3426) removed platforms, and 1076 (327) status-to-be-determined platforms where the numbers in parentheses represent those from Federal waters. Of these TSRS platforms, 4751 coincide spatially with 5476 (77.68%) of platform records of the Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement (BSEE) platform database; 2846 (387 in Federal waters) are not found in the BSEE platform database but are convincingly supported by data from other sources (including BSEE-pipeline-database, time-series VIIRS nighttime light products, and littoral ground truth images), meaning that 82.04% of the TSRS-derived platforms can be directly/indirectly confirmed. A site specific validation in East Bay using multi-temporal ground-truth aerial images indicates that, for this site, the false negative rate (FNR) is similar to 9.63% and the false positive rate (FPR) is only 4.44%. The detailed beginning/end dates of the TSRS platforms are mostly confirmed by the corresponding Installation/Site-clear dates recorded in the BSEE platform database. Our findings suggest that the TSRS approach is a robust and cost-effective way to assess oil/gas platform status in large regions, and our results here may complement the official database, narrow down locations for future field investigations, and provide critical information for future assessment of the potential impacts of active and decommissioned platforms on the marine environments.",,,,,,,,,30,0,0,0,7,0,30,,,0034-4257,1879-0704,,,,,,,,,,"Nanjing Univ, Dept Geog Informat Sci, Nanjing 210023, Jiangsu, Peoples R ChinaUniv S Florida, Coll Marine Sci, St Petersburg, FL 33701 USANanjing Univ, Int Inst Earth Syst Sci, Nanjing 210023, Jiangsu, Peoples R ChinaJiangsu Ctr Collaborat Innovat Geog Informat Reso, Nanjing 210023, Jiangsu, Peoples R ChinaNanjing Univ, Collaborat Innovat Ctr South China Sea Studies, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R ChinaNanjing Univ, Nanjing 210023, Jiangsu, Peoples R ChinaUniv S Florida, St Petersburg, FL 33701 USA",Jiangsu Ctr Collaborat Innovat Geog Informat Reso,,,2018-04-10,WOS:000428498400005,,

It is estimated that oil prices will reach 100 dollars in 2020 due to the economic development and population growth of emerging economics such as China, India, and Brazil, which will lead to the gradual expansion of demand for deep sea oil well development. The prediction is supported by analysis agencies of the offshore plants market such as Douglass Westwood, which estimated that the offshore plants market would make rapid growth to reach approximately 320 billion dollars by 2020. Thus four South Korean shipyards(Hyundai Heavy Industries, Samsung Heavy Industries, Daewoo Shipbuilding and Marine Engineering, and STX Offshore and Shipbuilding) are concentrating on winning orders for offshore plants rather than common merchant ships.Compared with shipbuilding, which involves building a ship and completing its trial run on the shipyard and then delivering it to the ship owner, offshore plant construction is exposed to relatively much more risks. In case of accident in the course of construction, the loss is too immense for perpetrator to fully fulfill the liability requirements. Even if assured fulfills the liability requirements, the amount does not which may well lead to by the sufferer, which leads to a legal dispute in many cases. Thus there is an increasing need for liability insurance in terms of the supplementation of the property damage of the insured, security of financial compensation means, legal remedy of the sufferer, and social stability regarding the human and physical loss to a third party during an offshore plant construction. The insured especially need to buy the liability terms of offshore plant construction insurance in order to ensure the safe progress and completion of offshore plant construction in such a situation of internal and external danger so that they can promote their own financial stability according to unexpected accidents and effectively manage risks.This study thus intends to review the liability relations in offshore plant construction insurance and propose a group of criteria to clarify who shall be held responsible among the participants of construction through examining and making interpretative analyses on the clause of liability term.",,,,"2012년도 세계에너지기구(International Energy Agency)의 향후 에너지 수급동향 보고서에 따르면 일본의 후쿠시마 다이치(Fukushima Daiichi) 원자력 발전소 사고 이후 원자력 에너지의 사용감소 현상과 더불어 단기적으로 석유 및 가스에너지에 대한 의존도가 증대되었다. 그리고 중국, 인도, 브라질 등의 신흥국가의 경제개발 및 인구증가로 인하여 2020년 유가가 100달러를 돌파할 것으로 전망됨에 따라 심해유전에 대한 개발 수요는 점차 확대될 것으로 전망된다. 이를 뒷받침하는 근거로서 Douglass Westwood사와 같은 해양플랜트 시장분석기관은 2020년까지 약 3,200억 달러 정도로 해양플랜트시장이 급성장할 것으로 예상하고 있고, 이에 따라 국내 조선소 4사(현대중공업, 삼성중공업, 대우조선해양, STX조선해양)도 일반 상선의 수주 보다 해양플랜트 수주에 집중하고 있다.육상건조장에서 선박을 건조하여 시운전을 마치고 선주에게 인도하는 신조선건조공사와 비교하여 해양플랜트공사는 상대적으로 훨씬 많은 위험에 노출되어 있다. 그리고 공사 중 사고가 발생할 경우 손해액이 커서 가해자는 손해배상책임을 성실히 이행할 수 없거나, 이행하더라도 피해자가 제기한 손해배상액에 상응하는 배상을 하지 않을 경우 많은 법적 분쟁이 예상된다. 따라서 해양플랜트공사 중 제3자에게 발생하는 인적․물적 손해에 대한 피보험자의 재산손해의 전보, 금전적 배상수단의 확보, 피해자 구제 및 사회안정의 측면에서 배상책임보험을 활용할 필요성이 점차 증대되고 있다. 특히 이러한 대․내외적인 위험 상황 속에서 해양플랜트공사를 안전하게 진행하고 완성하기 위해서 피보험자는 해양플랜트공사보험상의 배상책임약관을 추가적으로 가입하여 예상치 못한 사고에 따른 피보험자 스스로의 재정적인 안정성을 도모함과 동시에 효과적으로 위험을 관리해야 한다.따라서 이 논문은 해양플랜트공사보험에 있어서 배상책임관계를 검토하여 공사에 참여하는 각 주체간의 책임 소재를 구분할 수 있도록 기준을 마련하고, 배상책임약관에 대하여 해석론적으로 고찰하고자 한다.",,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,1598-1053,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2013-01-01,KJD:ART001791036,,

In this study, we investigated the effect of crude oil on denitrification and anammox. Controlled laboratory experiments were performed using sediment slurries from the Lima Estuary (NW Portugal). Anammox and denitrification rates were measured using N-15-labeled NO3-, and the production of N-29(2) and N-30(2) quantified by membrane inlet mass spectrometry. Results revealed that while denitrification rates were stimulated between 10 and 25 000 times after crude oil amendment, anammox activity was partially (between 2 and 5 times) or completely inhibited by the addition of crude oil when comparing to rates in unamended controls. Similar results were observed across four estuarine sediment types, despite their different physical chemical characteristics. Moreover, N2O production was reduced by 2-36 times following crude oil addition. Further work is required to fully understand the mechanism(s) of the observed reduction in N2O production.

From a former cotton and coconut economy in 1953, it became a major trade and tourist center currently having a population of more than 50,000 inhabitants in a land area of just 25 km2. Human activities directly affecting the marine environment have included dredge and fill operations, shipwrecks and groundings, disposal of urban waste, thermal pollution, over-fishing, construction along the shoreline, and diving, boating and beach-going activities. From qualitative observations carried out from 1968 to 1979, and quali- and quantitative resurveys made in 1992 to 1996, major biotic changes became evident in the upper insular platform (0-25 m in depth). These were: a detectable decline in live coral cover (to an overall mean of 30% of hard substrata in 1992), extensive recent coral mortality (overall mean in 1992 of 52% of total live + dead coral cover), almost total disappearance of the long-spined urchin Diadema antillarum and the sea-fan Gorgonia ventalina, proliferation of algae (to about 60-70% cover of the overall reef hard substrata in 1992), and an almost total absence of commercial reef organisms, including both carnivores and herbivores. With exceptions due to localized solid and sewage disposal, coastal construction and ship groundings, coral death followed a spatial pattern of increased values in lagoonal, enclosed environments and lower values in high energy zones and in deep reef areas. The higher coral death in shallow lagoonal areas was interpreted as being directly caused by a greater susceptibility of coral species making up the shallow reef frameworks (i.e., Acropora, Porites) to hurricane and storm damage and to diseases. Indirectly, it may have been caused by the effect of the prevalent regime in lagoonal areas of higher illumination (allowing greater algal growth after the die-off of Diadema), low turbulence and limited water flushing (causing higher susceptibility to bleaching and diseases, and lower rates of natural and artificial lesion regeneration), and by a higher incidence of lethal or chronic effects of anthropogenic activities.

The challenge for researchers is to place these observations into a longer-term context and produce computer models ('ice sheet forecasts') that reliably predict the fate of ice sheets over this century and beyond. Although remote from habitation, the polar ice sheets influence global sea level. Retreat by increased melting and iceberg calving produces higher sea levels and concerns exist that sea level may rise by metres displacing many millions of people, and their livelihoods, from their coastal homes. At this point in time, it is not possible to study the full life cycle of the present Antarctic or Greenland ice sheets as they are still evolving and undergoing large-scale changes. Instead, we will use an ice sheet that has now fully retreated; the ice sheet that covered most of Britain, Ireland and the North Sea during the last ice age. The last British-Irish ice sheet covered up to 1,000,000 km2 at its maximum size, around 25,000 yrs ago, and was relatively small by global standards. However, its character, setting and behaviour have striking parallels with both the modern West Antarctic and Greenland Ice Sheets.

Changes in orchard management could enable growers to meet eco-verification market demands for products with a low carbon footprint and potentially exploit the emerging business opportunity in carbon storage, while enhancing the delivery of ecosystem services that depend on soil carbon stocks. However, there is no standard methodology to verify any potential claims of carbon storage by perennial vine crops. We developed a robust methodology to quantify carbon storage in kiwifruit orchards. Soil carbon stocks (SCS) were determined in six depth increments to 1m deep in two adjacent kiwifruit blocks, which had been established 10 (young) and 25 (old) years earlier. We used a space-for-time analysis. Our key results were the young and old kiwifruit block stored about 139 and 145tC/ha to 1m depth. Between 80-90 percent of the SCS were stored in the top 0.5m, and 89-95 percent in the top 0.7m; there was no significant difference between the SCS in row and alley to a depth of 0.5m; a CV of 5-15 percent indicates that 4-10cores are needed for 80 percent confidence in the estimated SCS; we recommend separating each core into the depths 0-0.1, 0.1-0.3, 0.3-0.5, and 0.5-1m to allow the assessment of SCS dynamics; we detected a weak spatial pattern of the SCS only for the old kiwifruit block with a range of about 3m. A sampling bay along a vine row should have a maximum length of 3m. We then assessed SCS in more than sixty kiwifruit orchards throughout New Zealand. They stored on average 174.9 +/- 3tCha(-1) to 1m depth. On average, 51 percent of the SCS down to 1m depth were stored in the top 0.3m, which is the standard depth according to the Kyoto protocol. About 72 percent of the SCS to 1m depth were captured when increasing the sampling depth to 0.5m. These results underscore the necessity to analyze SCS in an orchard to at least 0.5m deep. Using the same methodology to 1m deep, we determined SCS in two wine grape vineyards on shallow, stony alluvial soils. We found a difference between vineyard and adjacent pasture SCS of nearly 16t/ha. As the vines are 25years old, this equates to carbon sequestration rates of 640kgha(-1)yr(-1). Our results of the space-for-time analysis also showed that all sequestration had occurred below 0.5m. Therefore, we decided to sample C to a greater depth. In a 30-year old kiwifruit orchard and an adjacent pasture, SCS was measured to 9m deep. In the kiwifruit orchard, we found a sequestration rate of 6.3tons of C per hectare per year greater than in the adjacent pasture that was the antecedent land use.",,,,,Thirteenth International Symposium on Soil and Plant Analysis (ISSPA)Thirteenth International Symposium on Soil and Plant Analysis (ISSPA),"APR 09-12, 2013APR 09-12, 2013","Soil & Plant Anal Council, Inc; Australasian Soil & Plant Anal Council Inc; AGMARDT; ARL; Balance; Hill Lab; DKSH; Elementar; IPNI; Agilent Technol; Agresearch; ALP; Bruker; CSBP; Massey Univ, Fertilizer & Lime Res Ctr; Lincoln Univ; MEP instruments; Perkin-Elmer; Perten; Plant & Food Res; Univ WaikatoSoil & Plant Anal Council, Inc; Australasian Soil & Plant Anal Council Inc; AGMARDT; ARL; Balance; Hill Lab; DKSH; Elementar; IPNI; Agilent Technol; Agresearch; ALP; Bruker; CSBP; Massey Univ, Fertilizer & Lime Res Ctr; Lincoln Univ; MEP instruments; Perkin-Elmer; Perten; Plant & Food Res; Univ Waikato","Queenstown, NEW ZEALANDQueenstown, NEW ZEALAND",8,0,0,0,5,0,8,,,0010-3624,1532-2416,,,,,,,,,,"PlusGroup Res, Tauranga, New ZealandPlant & Food Res, Hamilton, New ZealandProd Footprints & Biometr, Plant & Food Res, Palmerston North, New Zealand",PlusGroup Res,,,2015-02-27,WOS:000351900900010,,

Such unmanned platforms require on demand inspection,maintenance and repair work to be carried out along with scheduled works. In order to carryout such works, it is necessary for human engineers to be transferred to the platform inquestion. Such transfers are currently carried out through a variety of methods: helicoptertransfer, transfer gangways, stepping over the bow, or even through swing ropes. All of whichcarry with them a significant degree of risk and expense, both financially andenvironmentally.

Small Island States, such as Trinidad and Tobago, are highly vulnerable to climate change because of their small size and low elevation, as in the case of this study, which increases their sensitivity to climate change and limits their ability to adapt. In fact, the adaptive capacity of human systems is generally low in Small Island States, and vulnerability generally high. The Petroleum Company of Trinidad and Tobago (PETROTRIN) recently conducted a detailed vulnerability assessment survey and storm surge simulation through modelling for the west coast of Trinidad stretching from Vessigny River in the North to Cap-de-Ville in the South along the Gulf of Paria. This survey was undertaken so as to identify the impacts of climate driven, sea level rises and extreme storm surge events on Petrotrin's and Trinmar's infrastructure and operations. The methodology used to conduct this vulnerability assessment survey involved coupling A-OGCM (Atmosphere-Ocean General Circulation) model simulations of future sea level rises and TAOS (Total Arbiter of Storms) estimates of storm surges to a GIS-based inundation and erosion scheme so as to estimate land loss and infrastructure facilities at risk from inundation and erosion. The results of the study show that field installations in Petrotrin at Guapo, such as access roads, pipelines, storage tanks and even pump jacks and the offshore operations of Trinmar including offshore platforms, jetties and harbours and administrative buildings would be at severe risk of inundation and erosion deriving from sea level rises and storm surge events.",,,,,6th International Conference on Computer Simulation Risk Analysis and Hazard Mitigation6th International Conference on Computer Simulation Risk Analysis and Hazard Mitigation,20082008,,"Cephalonia, GREECECephalonia, GREECE",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,978-1-84564-104-7,,,,,,,,,"Univ Montreal, Dept Geog, Montreal, PQ H3C 3J7, CanadaPETROTRIN, Pointe A Pitre, Guadeloupe, France",PETROTRIN,,,2008-01-01,WOS:000256668100038,,

For each of these target fish, white muscle tissue was analyzed for total mercury (Hg) and results were evaluated relative to fish age, body size, and Hg content of preferred prey. Dietary and stable isotope analysis was also used to elucidate the effect of trophic processes on Hg concentrations in fish. The Hg content of muscle tissue was positively correlated with fish age and length for both species, although striped bass accumulated Hg faster than tautog. Accelerated Hg bioaccumulation in striped bass is consistent with its high trophic level (trophic level = 4.07) and Hg-enriched prey (forage fish and macro-crustaceans: mean Hg content = 0.03 mg Hg kg wet wt(-1)). In contrast, tautog maintain a lower trophic status (trophic level = 3.51) and consume prey with lower Hg levels (mussels and crabs; mean Hg content = 0.02 mg Hg kg wet wt(-1)). Despite differences in Hg bioaccumulation between target fish, the mean Hg concentration of tautog exceeded levels in striped bass (0.24 and 0.16 mg Hg kg wet wt(-1), respectively) due to a disparity in age-at-catch between sampled groups (mean age of tautog and bass = 11.3 and 4.3 yr, respectively). Taking into account legal minimum catch lengths further revealed that 75.0% of legal-size striped bass (>70.2 cm TL; n = 4) and 44.8% of tautog (>40.6 cm TL; n = 29) had Hg levels beyond the US EPA regulatory threshold of 0.3 mg Hg kg wet wt(-1). Moreover, Hg-length relationships suggest that each target fish meets this threshold near their minimum legal catch length. Our findings reiterate the Value of species ecology to improve predictions of fish Hg and permit better management of human contamination by this important dietary source. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Throw depth and throw-distance plots were used to understand the growth histories of individual faults. As a result, three families of concentric faults are identified: a) intra-seal faults within a salt-withdrawal basin, b) faults connecting the seal and the reservoir on the crest of an inverted anticline, c) raft-bounding faults propagating into reservoir units. They have moved obliquely and show normal throws, even though they formed during a period of regional compression. Faults in the salt-withdrawal basin and on the inverted anticline are highly segmented, increasing the chances of compartmentalisation or localised fluid flow through fault linkages. Slip tendency analysis was carried out on the distinct fault families to compare the likelihood of slip along a fault at different pore fluid pressures and within different lithologies. Our results show that sections of the faults are optimally oriented with regards to maximum horizontal stresses (sigma(Hmax).), increasing the slip tendency. The identified faults cut through a variety of lithologies, allowing different values of pore fluid pressures to build up before faults reactivate. Within the Vlieland Sandstones, pore fluid pressures of 30 MPa are not sufficient to reactivate pre-existing faults, whereas in the deeper Posidonia Shales faults might reactivate at pore fluid pressures of 25 MPa. Fluid flow features preferentially occur near fault segments close to failure. Heterogeneity in slip tendency along concentric faults, and high degrees of fault segmentation, present serious hazards when injecting CO2 into the subsurface. This study stresses the importance of high-quality 3D seismic data and the need to evaluate individual fault systems when investigating potential reservoirs for carbon capture and storage and enhanced oil recovery.

The turbulence profiles were derived from secondary current data using a 5-beam ADCP which was optimised for wave measurements. The tidal currents have peak flows of similar to 1 m/s during spring tide. The turbulence intensity is no less than 10% at peak flows and compares well with values at other tidal channels (at 5 m from seabed). The Reynolds stresses show symmetry at the neap tide but less so for the spring tide. Although the qualitative profiles of TKE are similar between the neap and spring tides, the values of TKE for flood flow are the largest throughout the deployment. The integral length scales are in good agreement with theory, and with estimates based on the mixing length concept. The measured turbulence parameters are sensitive to flow inhomogeneity, Doppler noise, and ADCP tilt. The findings demonstrate the practical benefits of exploiting secondary current data at a mixed low tidal energy site for estimating typical turbulence characteristics; such information can be used to define design standards and protocols for marine energy devices.

This paper describes a computer model developed to simulate the behaviour of oil and gas released from deepwater locations in the ocean. The model integrates the hydrodynamics and thermodynamics of the jet/plume with kinetics and thermodynamics of hydrate formation/decomposition.

The Offshore Installation Manager (OIM), is responsible for the safety of all persons onboard and within 500 m of an installation, and prevention of pollution to the environment from it.

These barriers are a consequence of current UK legislation and industry practices in the assessment of OIM competence. The research involved the qualitative analysis of key documentation, including legislation, using a critical hermeneutic approach to identify the potential barriers. Hermeneutics has historically been used to analyse texts within the domains of theology, business and law. The approach, however, also represents a powerful approach to the study of documents within the engineering domain and the offshore oil and gas industry.& para;& para;This paper addresses the specific question - who is accountable for OIM competence? It discusses two of the identified potential barriers which weaken ownership of both the appointment and competence assessment of OIMs. One, resulting from the Duty Holder (OSD Installation) regime that has evolved within the UK; and one resulting from the ever changing and overly complicated distribution of responsibilities across UK Government departments associated with health, safety and the environment. The paper consequently addresses those barriers associated with lack of ownership of duties both within the offshore oil and gas industry and UK Government.& para;& para;The research is important to Duty Holders within the offshore oil and gas industry, safety engineers and UK Government departments with respect to the effectiveness of competence assessment of appointed OIMs. It is also significant to risk engineers when considering the probable competence of an OIM in a given environment at a given point in time.

It is a companion report to the earlier one by Haggarty et al. (2003) on marine environmental quality in British Columbia's Central Coast (CC). Together, these two reports form the basis for a third summary report which encompasses the revised and presently described Pacific North Coast Integrated Management Area (PNCIMA; Johannessen et al. 2007). This NC report reviews contaminant sources, types, and risks for the northern mainland coast of BC and the Queen Charlotte Islands. This region encompasses the northern portion of the steep and rugged coastal fjordlands including the Skeena and Nass watersheds, as well as the less mountainous but similarly rugged coastline of the Queen Charlotte Islands. The marine area covers the continental shelf and slope waters of Dixon Entrance, most of Hecate Strait, and the waters off the west coast of the Queen Charlotte Islands, roughly a third of BC's coastal waters. This area is among the least populated in BC, with only similar to 80,000 residents (about 2% of BC's total). However, the area supports significant human activities such as mining and smelting operations, fishing activities,. and abundant marine traffic. In addition, it is subject to various global transport mechanisms that bring persistent pollutants into the area. Existing literature suggests that current risks to marine environmental quality include shipping traffic, which produces chronic oil releases among other wastes; metal contamination from existing and previous mining activities, particularly in the Alice Arm area; hydrocarbon contamination, particularly in the area around the Kitimat smelter; pulp mill effluents in Kitimat and Prince Rupert; potential contamination due to port related activities in Prince Rupert and Kitimat; and possible contamination issues related to past practices at military and coast guard sites. Emerging issues for the area include potential oil and gas exploration, a rapidly expanding cruise ship industry, and possible growth in the aquaculture industry.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,0706-6457,0706-6570,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2007-01-01,BCI:BCI200800036116,,

These assets, during their operational lifetime, are subjected to various degradation mechanisms such as corrosion, erosion, wear, creep and fatigue cracks. In order to improve economic viability and increase profitability, many operators are looking at extending the lifespan of their assets beyond the original design life, thereby making life extension (LE) an increasingly critical and highly-discussed topic in the offshore oil and gas industry. In order to manage asset aging and meet the LE requirements, offshore oil and gas operators have adopted various approaches such as following maintenance procedures as advised by the original equipment manufacturer (OEM), or using the experience and expertise of engineers and inspectors. However, performing these activities often provides very limited value addition to operators during the LE period of operation. This paper aims to propose a systematic framework to help operators meet LE requirements while optimizing their cost structure. This framework establishes an integration between three individual life assessment modules, namely: condition assessment, remaining useful life (RUL) prediction and LE decision-making. The benefits of the proposed framework are illustrated through a case study involving a three-phase separator system on a platform which was constructed in the mid-1970s in West Africa. The results of this study affirm the effectiveness of this framework in minimizing catastrophic failures during the LE phase of operations, whilst ensuring compliance to regulatory requirements.

Capelin (Mallotus villosus) is a small fish and a member of the smelt family, and is a key species in the marine food chain. Capelin are seasonally abundant in the Northern Atlantic and in coastal Arctic waters, e.g. in western Greenland and in the Barents Sea, where it undertakes aggregated spawning in the intertidal and subtidal zone.To study the possible effects of oil pollution on the physiology and development of early life stages in capelin, freshly fertilised capelin eggs were exposed to a water accommodated fraction of physically (WAF) and chemically (CEWAF) dispersed heavy fuel oil (IFO30) for 72 h. Subsequent mortality, hatching success, larvae malformations, growth and CYP1A/EROD activity was measured over a 4-week period.The nominal exposure concentrations of WAF and CEWAF were between 0.02 and 14.5 mg total hydrocarbon content (THC) L-1 and 0.5-304 mg THC L-1, respectively. Egg mortality correlated significantly with WAF exposure concentration. The proportions of hatched eggs decreased with increasing CEWAF exposure concentration. Further, the percentage of malformed larvae with craniofacial abnormalities, body axis defects, generally under developed larvae, reduced total body length (dwarfs), correlated significantly with exposure concentrations in both CEWAF and WAF treatments. The four types of the predominant malformations were distributed differently in two parallel experiments. At the biochemical level, we observed a significant relationship between CEWAF exposure concentration and CYP1A/EROD activity in newly hatched larvae and this effect persisted for 3 weeks after the 72 h exposure.We conclude that even short-term exposure to both heavy fuel oil WAF and CEWAF, at environmentally relevant THC concentrations following an oil spill, may induce adverse developmental effects on the vulnerable early life stages of capelin. The mechanisms responsible for the observed effects on mortality, growth and embryo development in capelin eggs and embryos following WAF and CEWAF exposure require further studies.",,,,,,,,,9,0,0,0,5,0,9,,,0141-1136,1879-0291,,,,,,,,,,"Aarhus Univ, Dept Biosci, Frederiksborgvej 399,Box 358, DK-4000 Roskilde, DenmarkAkvaplan Niva AS, Fram Ctr, POB 6606 Langnes, N-9296 Tromso, NorwayNorwegian Univ Sci & Technol NTNU, Dept Biol, Trondheim, NorwayUniv Oslo, Fac Math & Nat Sci, Dept Biosci, Postboks 1066 Blindern, N-0316 Oslo, Norway",,,,2019-06-26,WOS:000471359000007,31047709,

Several species of fish spawn in direct proximity to offshore production platforms and may be at risk of AP exposure. Therefore, a sensitive method to determine the potential for bioaccumulation of APs in fish eggs is needed.Methods Fish eggs were extracted using liquid-solid extraction followed by gel permeation chromatography cleanup. Analysis was performed by gas chromatography coupled to triple quadrupole mass spectrometry. Extraction and analytical conditions were optimized for analysis of phenol and 30 APs (C-1-C-9) with different degrees of branching in the alkyl chain. The method was verified and applied to analyze the body residue of APs in PW-exposed marine fish (Atlantic cod, Gadus morhua) eggs.Results A comprehensive and sensitive method for the determination of C-0-C-9 APs was developed.

In this study, we assessed the effect of wave exposure on sedimentary carbon and nitrogen accumulation using existing data from 53 Z. marina meadows at the Swedish west coast. We found that meadows with higher hydrodynamic exposure had larger absolute organic carbon and nitrogen stocks (at 0-25 cm depth). This can be explained by a hydrodynamically induced sediment compaction in more exposed sites, resulting in increased sediment density and higher accumulation (per unit volume) of sedimentary organic carbon and nitrogen. With higher sediment density, the erosion threshold is assumed to increase, and as climate change-induced storms are predicted to be more common, we suggest that wave exposed meadows can be more resilient toward storms and might therefore be even more important as carbon- and nutrient sinks in the future.",,,,,,,,,12,2,0,0,8,0,14,,,2045-2322,,,,,,,,,,,"Stockholm Univ, Dept Ecol Environm & Plant Sci, Seagrass Ecol & Physiol Res Grp, Stockholm, SwedenUniv Gothenburg, Dept Marine Sci, Gothenburg, SwedenUniv Gothenburg, Dept Biol & Environm Sci, Gothenburg, SwedenNorwegian Inst Water Res NIVA, Oslo, NorwayAquaBiota Water Res, Stockholm, SwedenSodertorn Univ, Sch Nat Sci Technol & Environm Studies, Stockholm, Sweden",AquaBiota Water Res,,,2020-08-12,WOS:000563536800016,32788660,

Certainly, due to the reduced available space and the weight constraints, combined cycles are not commonly considered as cogeneration systems on conventional offshore petroleum platforms. However, more stringent environmental policies for the natural gas and oil production activities have motivated the integration assessment of advanced technological solutions that aim to mitigate the environmental impact that conventional offshore platforms are responsible for. Accordingly, in this paper, the effect of the integration of a low emission, oxyfuel gas turbine cycle is analyzed and compared against an amines-based post-combustion system and a conventional offshore petroleum platform operation in terms of its exergy efficiency and reduced atmospheric CO2 emissions. Indeed, although the conventional configuration is the most efficient, the oxyfuel powered platform configuration presents close power cycle efficiency of 27.10% and the lowest specific CO2 emissions of 0.014 kg(co2)/t(oil), whereas the amines-based layout provides the best cogeneration efficiency (55.34%) of the advanced configurations. Moreover, an energy integration analysis is performed to identify the heat recovery potential, while the exergy method is used to evaluate and quantify the most critical components that lead to the largest irreversibilities along the primary separation, cogeneration and gas compression systems.

This unusual introduction was first brought to scientific attention in 1967 and, since that time, numerous studies have been made of the lagoon and its unique inhabitant. In 1870, an English barquentine, Spindrift, was sailing on its maiden voyage from Liverpool to the Antilles in the West Indies. Blown off its recommended course by a storm and disabled, it wrecked offshore from Faja de Santo Cristo on the night of 6 December 1870. The ship was mainly transporting textiles that were washed onto the shoreline of Faja de Santo Cristo but, in addition to other domestic items, it was possibly also carrying living ameijoas (Venerupis decussate) as fresh seafood for the crew. This study provides other evidence that V. decussata was not noticeably present in Faja de Santo Cristo in 1906 but that this was probably because of the distant chances of larvae colonizing the still-evolving lagoon from the parent population lost with the sinking of the Spindrift. Still-evolving because the genesis of the faja was not created until 9 July 1757 when a massive earthquake founded the Santo Cristo platform. Several decades later, however, in 1924, records indicate that the population of ameijoas within the lagoon had grown explosively. The possible manner in which the successful colonization of the lagoon by V. decussata took place is described and discussed, again calling upon historical, orally-recalled, memories. It is concluded that the current practice of raking to harvest the ameijoas is analogous to the practice of beach floor tillage undertaken to enhance the larval settlement of the Manila clam, Venerupis philippinarum, throughout Asia and, now, in its introduced range of Europe. It is finally argued that this method of harvesting be continued, on a sustainable scale, to ensure the continuing success of V. decussata in the Faja de Santo Cristo.",,,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Hong Kong, Sch Biol Sci, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China",,,,2015-09-03,ZOOREC:ZOOR15109061308,,

The Brazilian pre-salt basin which forecast high fuel gas production is taken as a case study. A model was developed, integrating the design of the gas turbine, heat recovery units, steam turbine and condenser. Genetic algorithms were applied in two optimization approaches, single-objective and multi-objective. Three parameters were evaluated: equipment purchase cost, thermal efficiency and total weight. The results of the multi-objective optimization indicated that dual-pressure arrangements, featuring 3 gas turbines, 1 heat recovery steam generator and 1 steam cycle, could be an attractive design solution for power hubs. This arrangement has a low cost and weight, while the thermal efficiency is maintained at a reasonably high level (around 53.2%). Moreover, results indicated that CO2 emissions may be reduced by 18.7%-27.2% at design point and 19% for the power hub lifetime, when compared with the conventional energy supply scenario.

Speed optimization strategies applied in tactical vessel planning significantly reduce fuel consumption and thus emissions. Nevertheless, the environmental performance of these strategies in rough weather conditions is difficult to estimate as the duration of supply vessel operations is weather dependent. In this paper we develop a simulation-optimization tool which estimates the average fuel consumption for weekly vessel schedules. The schedules are constructed by using speed optimized vessel voyages which are simulated under different weather conditions. Results of experiments on real instances show that rough weather conditions increase fuel consumption and costs. The application of speed optimization strategies reduces fuel consumption both in winter and summer, but the reduction may be at the expense of a fixed vessel cost increase in the winter season.",,,,,,,,,24,0,0,0,0,0,25,,,1361-9209,,,,,,,,,,,"Molde Univ Coll, POB 2110, N-6402 Molde, NorwayStatoil ASA, POB 7190, N-5254 Sandsli, Norway",,,,2017-12-11,WOS:000416495900002,,

This paper presents a description of the main pollutant sources in Tarragona Harbour (Spain), and a numerical analysis of several pollution episodes based on the Port Authority's actual environmental concerns. The results show that pollution generated inside the harbour tends to remain confined within the port, whereas it is very likely that oil spills from a nearby monobuoy may affect the neighbouring beaches. The present combination of numerical models proves itself a useful tool to assess the environmental risk associated to harbour activities and potential pollution spills. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

The survey consisted of acoustically mapping specific seep sites within the Coal Oil Point seep field, commonly known as Platform Holly, Seep Tent, La Goleta, Patch and Trilogy. The survey was conducted with three downward-looking broadband echosounders: an MSI Constant Beamwidth Transducer (CBW) (30-100 kHz), a Simrad ES200-7C split-beam echosounder (150-250 kHz) and a Simrad ES333 split-beam echosounder (290-490 kHz). The echosounders were interfaced with an EK80 Wideband Transceiver and were deployed on a tow sled on the port side of the R/V Connell. A Garmin WAAS-enabled GPS was attached to the tow sled and was integrated into the Simrad EK80 software to record the position of the echosounders. A Seabird 19plus V2 CTD was used to collect profiles of salinity and temperature in the water column after each survey. A 300 kHz RDI ADCP was used for measuring water current profiles. During the last day of survey, 14 September 2016, a low-frequency single-beam transducer (1-10 kHz) was used to map a small subset of the seep field. All surveys were performed at vessel speeds of 4-6 knots depending on the weather conditions of the survey day.On 31 August 2016, the instruments were mounted to the R/V Connell and were tested during an on-shore shake down.On 1 September 2016, the tow sled and instruments were tested at-sea using various configurations in order to determine the optimal configuration to minimize noise interference with the echosounders.On 2 September 2016, an EW 500 m by 500 m survey, with 10 m line spacing, was conducted at Patch. Gas seepage was visible throughout the survey, both in the acoustic data and near the surface of the water column. The sea surface was lightly oiled in some areas of the survey. The survey took four hours to complete and was followed with a CTD cast. Finally, a short (500 m) transect ADCP survey was conducted.On 6 September 2016, a NS 500 m by 500 m survey, with 10 m line spacing, was conducted near Platform Holly. Gas seepage was visible predominantly near the platform, both in the acoustic data and significantly by eye near the platform. The sea surface was heavily oiled, especially near the platform. The survey took a total of four hours to complete and was followed with a CTD cast near the center of the survey area. An initial attempt at calibrating the echosounders was performed south of Platform Holly, however it was decided to move east of Patch for the calibration to avoid seeps during the calibration procedure. The calibration was performed using a 38.1 mm and 25.0 mm Tungsten-Carbide calibration spheres. A 12.67 mm Tungsten-Carbide calibration sphere was also used to attempt to calibrate the echosounders, however it was too small and light to use in the calibration site.On 7 September 2016, an EW 500 m by 500 m survey, with 10 m line spacing, was conducted at Seep Tent. The sea surface was heavily oiled at the site. Gas bubbles were also observed at the sea surface in the site. The survey took four hours to complete and was followed by a second EW 500 m by 500 m survey, with 10 m line spacing, conducted at La Goleta. Oil and gas bubbles were observed at the sea surface throughout the survey area. The survey took approximate four hours and forty minutes to complete and was followed with a CTD cast near the La Goleta survey area.On 8 September 2016, an EW 1000 m (EW) by 600 m (NS) survey, with 20 m line spacing, was conducted at Trilogy, followed by 6 evenly spaced NS lines across the survey area. The sea surface was slightly oiled in some locations in the survey area and three distinct locations within the seep area had significant quantity of gas bubbles at the sea surface. The survey took four and a half hours to complete and was followed with a CTD cast in the survey area. Following the CTD cast, ADCP operations were performed around Platform Holly. A NS line was conducted, once going north and then repeated going south, to the west of Platform Holly. A similar NS line was performed in both directions very close to the platform on the east side of the platform. It appeared that the lines were too close to the platform and the pilings caused issues with the data. Another NS line, heading north then south, was completed farther east from the platform. Another survey was conducted near Platform Holly. Survey lines were conducted as circles around the platform, starting as close as possible to the platform and extending the circle diameter until no seepage activity was observed in the acoustic data.On 9 September 2016, a SE-NW 1300 m by 8500 m survey, with 412.5 m line spacing, was conducted. In addition, three groups of two lines, perpendicular to the broad survey lines, were conducted between seep sites. The broad survey encompassed the Platform Holly, Seep Tent, La Goleta and Patch seep sites. The survey took a total of five hours to complete and was followed with a CTD cast near the Patch survey site. A NS transect line was conducted with the ADCP near Patch after the CTD cast.On 12 September 2016, a SE-NW 600 m by 850 m survey, with 20 m line spacing, was conducted to the northwest of Seep Tent. The survey took approximately one hour to complete. A CTD cast and a NS ADCP survey were performed after the survey near Seep Tent. A transit line was conducted between the ADCP survey site and Platform Holly. Once the vessel reached Platform Holly, another ADCP survey was conducted near the platform. An acoustic survey was conducted, with random lines, near Platform Holly. The survey was conducted with the intent of locating oil surfacing near the gas seep.On 13 September 2016, a broad SE-NW survey with two lines centered between the previous broad survey lines was conducted. Two NS survey lines were conducted near Platform Holly. Two NS survey lines were conducted through the center and west part of La Goleta and then two additional NS lines were conducted near Patch. A CTD cast was performed after the survey, in the vicinity of the Patch seep site.On 14 September 2016, two broad SW-NE survey lines were conducted using the low-frequency (1-10 kHz) single-beam echosounder. One NS survey line was conducted to the west of Platform Holly and then acoustic data was collected while the vessel drifted around the west side of the platform. Additional NS survey lines were conducted at Seep Tents, La Goleta and Patch. Acoustic data while the vessel drifted was also collected at these survey sites. A CTD casts was performed at the end of the acoustic survey.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2020-03-03,DRCI:DATA2020024018055622,,

Their diet consists primarily of intertidal blue mussels, which can accumulate PAHs; accordingly, goldeneyes may be susceptible to exposure through contaminated prey. In 2014/15, we examined total PAH concentrations in mussels from undeveloped and developed coastal areas of BC At those same sites, we used EROD to measure hepatic CYP1A induction in goldeneyes. We found higher mussel PAH concentrations at developed coastal sites. Regionally, goldeneyes from southern BC, which has relatively higher coastal development, had higher EROD activity compared to birds from northern BC Our results suggest goldeneyes wintering in coastal BC were exposed to PAHs through diet, with higher exposure among birds wintering in coastal areas with greater anthropogenic influence. These results suggest the mussel-goldeneye system is suitable as a natural, multi-trophic-level indicator of contemporary hydrocarbon contamination, occurrence and exposure useful for establishing oil spill recovery endpoints.

However, the role of the dispersant Corexit in mediating oil-sedimentation is still controversial. Here we demonstrate that the formation of diatom MOS is enhanced by chemically undispersed oil, but inhibited by Corexit-dispersed oil. Nevertheless, the sedimentation rate of oil may at times be enhanced by Corexit application, because of an elevated oil content per aggregate when Corexit is used. A conceptual framework explains the seemingly contradictory effects of Corexit application on the sedimentation of oil and marine particles. The redistribution of oil has central ecological implications, and future decisions on mediating measures or damage assessment will have to take the formation of sinking, oil-laden, marine snow into account.",,,,,,,,,45,0,0,0,36,0,48,,,0025-326X,1879-3363,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Inst Marine Sci, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USATexas A&M Univ, Dept Marine Biol, Galveston, TX 77553 USATexas A&M Univ, Dept Oceanog, College Stn, TX 77843 USA",,,,2018-01-09,WOS:000418727000028,28807420,

During self-installation the spudcan often penetrates several tens of meters into seabed soils, where large variations often occur in the shear strength of the soils. Although the failure mechanisms and bearing capacity of spudcan foundations have been studied in homogeneous soil and layered uniform soil, the effect of the spatial variability in soil strength on the spudcan response is still unclear. This study presents a random finite element method (RFEM) for assessing the failure mechanisms and-the bearing capacity of a spudcan foundation embedded in spatially varied seabed soils. A comprehensive review of seabed soils discusses typical ranges of the mean, the coefficient of variation and the scale of fluctuation of the undrained shear strength. Random fields are generated and mapped into a non-linear finite element analysis to reveal the failure mechanisms of the spudcan in spatially varied soils. The influence-of the scale of fluctuation in different directions is investigated. The results indicate that ignoring the spatial variability of soil strength leads to an overestimation of the bearing capacity. It is unconservative for the foundation design to assume an isotropic random field model in the RFEM analysis.

However, few data are available to evaluate variation in carbon burial over decades to centuries, particularly in subtropical seagrass meadows. Here we assess historical trends in rates of vertical accretion and carbon burial in subtropical seagrass sediments in Moreton Bay, Australia. A total of 19 sediment cores varying in length from 22 to 205 cm were collected from six locations, including two locations where seagrass meadows occurred historically but were lost in recent decades. Cores were dated using Pb-210 and C-14. Geochronologies were modelled based on the successful Pb-210 dates for two of the locations combined with C-14 at five locations. Organic and inorganic carbon content, dry bulk density and stable carbon and nitrogen isotope composition (delta C-13(org), delta N-15) were measured throughout the cores. Sediments underlying seagrass meadows in Moreton Bay have organic carbon stored up to a depth of at least 2 m which dates to over 7000 yr BP. Across the entire time series, organic carbon burial rates averaged 19 g m(-2) yr(-1) and inorganic carbon burial rates averaged 27 g m(-2) y(-1). Overall mean rates of vertical accretion were estimated to be 0.2 cm y(-1). Rates of vertical accretion accelerated 10-fold following European colonisation which commenced in 1824, from 0.06 +/- 0.06 cm yr(-1) to 0.66 +/- 1.19 cm y(-1). Similarly, rates of organic carbon burial averaged 7.2 +/- 5.5 g m(-2) y(-1) but then increased 7-fold post-colonisation to 50.5 +/- 82.1 gm(-2) y(-1). Thus, in Moreton Bay, European settlement and associated land-use change has enhanced sediment accretion and carbon burial in seagrass sediments. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Contamination produced was very extensive (70% of Galician beaches were reached by the oil) but heterogeneous, alternating intensely affected zones with neighbour locations where the repercussion was minimal. The objective of this study was to monitor sea environment contamination caused by Prestige oil spill during an 11-month period (August 2003-June 2004, nine samplings) in two locations of Galician coast with different geographical properties (Lira and Ancoradoiro beaches), by means of chemical determination of total polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (TPAH) in seawater, and using as exposure biomarker TPAH content in mussel (Mytilus galloprovincialis) tissues, and as effect biomarker DNA damage in mussel gills, evaluated by the comet assay. In addition, recovery ability of the mussels was determined after a 7-day stay in the laboratory. TPAH contents in seawater were very high in the earliest samplings, but then they maintained below 200 ng L-1, similar to reference seawater. However, TPAH levels in mussel tissues were more variable: they increased again from January 2004, probably due to the adverse meteorological conditions that turned over the sea bottom and dispersed the oil accumulated in sediments. In most samplings, these levels decreased during the recovery stage. DNA damage in oil-exposed mussels was significantly higher than in reference mussels, both before and after the recovery phase, but they did not differ to one another. Comet tail length was slightly reduced during the recovery stage, indicative of a certain DNA repair in exposed mussels. This study showed up the importance of monitoring sea contamination events during an extended time, not only in evaluating the presence of the contaminants in the environment but also in determining their bioaccumulation and their effect on the exposed organisms.

Rampant rise in Greenhouse Gases (GHG) emissions drives the big wheel of climate change which affects human societies, animal habitats and woodlands by flash floods, glacial melts, acidic rains, droughts, famines, wildfires, epidemics, heat and cold waves. South Asia is one of the most severely affected regions on the planet due to its demographics. The per capita impact of climate change on the millions of Pakistanis is very high compared to their diminutive per capita share of global GHG emissions. Environmental issues of South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) countries include deforestation, air pollution, desertification, glacial melts, sea level rise, water contamination and loss of biodiversity. Pakistan is among the top ten countries worst hit by climate change, where native populations of lions, leopards, dolphins, tortoise and vultures face extinction threat. Acacia and rosewood tree forests in Sindh, Punjab and Pak-Afghan precincts have already dried by dieback disease during 1998-2005. Hundreds of people succumb to death annually by heat waves in South during summer and cold waves in North during winter. Climate change is a global phenomenon; nevertheless, higher GHG emissions first affect local and regional territories and later impact worldwide. Pakistan's CO2 emissions are greater than least developed SAARC countries but much lower than the nearby Himalayan slope countries. This paper reports impact of CO2 emissions on society, forests, crops and wildlife in Pakistan recounting adaptation and mitigation strategies in SAARC countries.

As part of the GLOBEC NEP study, the specific objectives of this project are: 1) to provide data on alongshore and temporal variability in the coastal ocean nearshore environment of the Pacific Northwest region on scales of hours to several years and 2) in conjunction with other GLOBEC investigators, to determine dominant factors controlling alongshore and temporal variability in ocean water properties and currents. To fulfill these objectives the PIs will maintain moored arrays to measure currents and water properties at two locations, one off southern Oregon (Coos Bay); the other off the central Washington coast (Grays Harbor). With the addition of these two arrays, the GLOBEC field study will include an alongshore time series array sufficient to define large scale alongshore water property gradients and responses to forcing mechanisms. These installations will continue an already two year long time series at each site. In addition, an earlier 5 year time series (the longest on the West Coast shelf north of Point Conception) is available at the Coos Bay site. Thus, by the end of this project, the Coos Bay site would include 11 record years, the Washington site, six years.

These factors have exacerbated conflicts among different user groups. As a result, coastal and marine cultural resource managers now face difficult problems of shipwreck resource allocation and management. However, because of the lack of information about ''nonmarket'' benefits associated with different management alternatives, it is likely that historic shipwreck resources are being allocated inefficiently among different user groups.

A method of providing a continuous power supply from a cluster of AWE systems whose individual operation produces a periodic power supply is outlined. This method employs direct drive, directly interconnected permanent magnet synchronous generators on a local bus. A full-scale power converter is located at the point of grid connection, providing compliant power output for the remote cluster. In the case of a marine environment deployment, the power electronics are located onshore where maintenance and repair can be readily performed without the delays and costs associated with offshore maintenance and repair. The direct interconnection of synchronous generators introduces the requirement for a control system to control the connection of offline machines to the energised bus.

The increase in produced water stresses the currently deployed deoiling technologies, resulting in more oil in the discharged water. Deploying membrane filtration to reduce the hydrocarbon concentration inherits additional complications related to fouling of the membranes: A process where the accumulation of material within and on the membrane surface adds additional flow resistance. This paper reviews and analyses the fouling detection, removal, prevention, dynamical and static modeling, with emphasis on how the membrane process can be manipulated from a process control perspective. The majority of the models rely on static descriptions or are limited to a narrow range of operating conditions which limits the usability of the models. This paper concludes that although the membrane filtration has been successfully applied and matured in many other industrial areas, challenges regarding cost-effective mitigation of fouling in the offshore deoiling applications, still exist. Fouling-based modeling combined with online parameter identification could potentially expand the operating range of the models and facilitate advanced control design to address transient performance and scheduling of fouling removal methods, resulting in cost-effective operation of membrane filtration systems.

Based on comprehensive analysis of seismic, well logging, core and thin section data, sequence architecture and depositional evolution of the carbonate platform and their controlling processes are documented. Fourteen lithofacies and five lithofacies associations of the Lower Carboniferous carbonate systems are identified according to thin section, core and logging data. The main depositional facies include platform margin reef-shoal, platform margin and open platform shoal, restricted platform shoal, intrashoal-tidal flat and lagoon-evaporate platform deposits. The Lower Carboniferous consists of four composite sequences (CS1-4) mainly bounded by regional unconformities, nine sequences confined by local unconformities and eighteen fourth-order sequences defined by instantaneous exposed discontinuities. Sequences are generally composed of the transgressive systems tracts (TST) and the highstand systems tracts (HST). TST consists mainly of medium-low energy intershoal or tidal flat deposits, while HST is characterized by evaporative lagoon, open platform or platform margin reef-shoal complexes. The research indicates that the carbonate platform experienced the evolution from ramp-non rimmed platform (CS1-2) to rimmed platform (CS3-4) in the study area. Large-scale transgressions occurred at the lower-middle parts of CS2 and CS3, resulting in the short-period submergence of the platform. The sedimentary architecture from the transgressive marlstone, wackestone in the bottom to gypsum in the top in CS4 and CS1 is suggested to be attributed to the interplay of climate and sea level changes. The sea level changes reflected by sequence architectures of the Lower Carboniferous in the study area appear to be comparable with Haq's global sea-level changes. The high-frequent fluctuation of sea-level changes (CS3-4) during the Icehouse in the Early Carboniferous may have an important influence on the development of the third to fourth order depositional cycles of the carbonate deposits.",,,,,,,,,5,1,0,0,0,0,6,,,0264-8172,1873-4073,,,,,,,,,,"China Univ Geosci, Sch Ocean Sci, Beijing 100083, Peoples R ChinaChina Univ Geosci, Sch Energy Resources, Beijing 100083, Peoples R ChinaGeojade Petr Corp, Beijing 100016, Peoples R China",Geojade Petr Corp,,,2019-12-12,WOS:000498747300034,,

Based on the principle that oil dispersants decrease surface tension, a linear correlation was established between the dispersant concentration and surface tension. Thus, the dispersant concentration can be determined by measuring surface tension. The method can accurately analyze Corexit EC9500A in the concentration range of 0.5-23.5 mg/L. Minor changes in solution salinity (<0.3%), pH (7.9-9.0), and dissolved organic matter (<2.0 mg/L as TOC) had negligible effects on the measurements. Moreover, effects of extracts from marine sediments were negligible, and thus, the method may be directly applied to seawater-sediment systems. The method accuracy was confirmed by comparing with direct TOC analysis. This simple, fast, economical method offers a convenient analytical tool for quantifying complex oil dispersants in water/seawater, which has been desired by the oil spill research community and industries.

Especially the number of tourists visiting the Arctic can reach far more than 1000 per vessel, resulting in growing headaches for the responsible safety and security authorities in the Arctic surrounding countries. Up to now no suitable Escape, Evacuation and Rescue (EER) concept is in place to cope with these challenges when it comes to hazardous situations.In this context IMPaC ([1]) developed a new and appropriate EER concept for the Arctic, exceeding the currently dominant small and isolated settlements along the coastlines in Denmark (Greenland), Norway, Russia, Canada and the US. One question seems to be central: Is there any requirement and benefit beyond the currently used small rescue station?Yes, we strongly believe that there is a growing demand for suitable infrastructure coming from various industries. Beyond rescue objectives there is a demand for people working and living in this area all year long, for a few days, weeks or months using these settlements for their specific needs. This led us to the idea of the provision of a common-use infrastructure for multiple industries. The commonly used infrastructure maximizes the use of the remote and very expensive infrastructure and minimizes the impact on the environment in this part of the world.Potential users of this infrastructure would be:Oil & Gas Industry, driven by the increased world energy demandMarine Transport & Tourism Industry, driven by declined arctic ice and new sea routes via the Arctic seaFishery IndustryScientific communityAny EER concept for the Arctic has to cope with several specific environmental and spatial challenges as addressed by the EU joint research project ACCESS ([2]), where IMPaC participates.

Coastal rock pools of barrier islands were sampled to determine how communities varied spatially between two horizontal zones, defined by wave disturbance and distance from shore, and from island-to-island. Pupal exuviae were collected monthly from pool surfaces to assess species composition, true community richness, and alpha and beta diversity. Cluster analyses were used to determine geographic community variation. A majority of species were rare, while three species dominated relative abundances. Zonal differences were significant, diversity was greater in near-shore pools overall, and few species occurred in both zones. Communities were more species-rich than expected based on prior studies in similar habitats. Community clusters were not strongly differentiated but suggested increased dispersal challenges at wider gaps between islands. Higher diversity near the shore and geographic clustering of communities are important to consider when planning for remediation activities following pollution events such as ship groundings or oil spills.

The flood pulse of the river is critical to providing autogenic feedbacks between flow patterns, sediment delivery, vegetation productivity, and organic/inorganic accretion that produce spatial patterns of land elevation, habitat diversity, and estuary dynamics. Coastal deltaic floodplains form in the proximal region of an active delta as bar-shaped islands with interdistributary bays shape hydrogeomorphic zones influenced by both geophysical and ecological processes. Hydrogeomorphic zones in coastal deltaic floodplains of the proximal sedimentation zone can also be defined by time since subaerial emergence accounts for variability in vegetation community composition and soil successional development. The reduction in sedimentation and increase in both above- and belowground biomass associated with formation of hydrogeomorphic zones results in significant increase in organic matter density in soils, with higher N:P ratios reflecting the biotic feedback of ecological succession on delta floodplain development. In both the proximal and distal sedimentation regions, episodic events, such as river floods and cold fronts, control seasonal water levels, marsh platform inundation, and increase in elevation capital. In coastal deltaic floodplains, an increase in vegetation height and density has a twofold effect: it favors trapping of sediment on the islands; whereas an increase in roughness deflects water flow and sediment into the channels thus bypassing the marsh surface. There is evidence that this is in contrast to more constant positive feedback of vegetation on sedimentation in distal estuarine marsh platforms. Delta estuaries go through a transformation from a near-riverine estuary in the winter-spring season to a near-marine lagoon in the summer-fall season. Geomorphological displacement of vegetation types occurs as platform elevation increases in the proximal sedimentation zone as delta landform emerges, with specific vegetation dominating the respective subtidal, intertidal and supratidal hydrogeomorphic zones. This does not occur in the distal sedimentation zone that lack sediment input as marsh platform elevation decreases. This is due to presence of salinity and H2S that limit the capacity of biotic feedbacks to contribute to marsh stability. The growth of a coastal deltaic floodplain in the proximal sedimentation region of Atchafalaya Coastal Basin along with stable estuarine marshes in distal sedimentation region demonstrate the value of longterm riverine influence by preventing loss of wetland platform elevation.",,,,,,,,,31,2,0,0,11,0,39,,,0272-7714,1096-0015,,,,,,,,,,"Louisiana State Univ, Dept Oceanog & Coastal Sci, Coll Coast & Environm, Baton Rouge, LA 70803 USALouisiana State Univ, Louisiana Sea Grant, Baton Rouge, LA 70803 USAJacobs, 700 Main St,Suite 400, Baton Rouge, LA 70801 USACoastal Protect & Restorat Author, Baton Rouge, LA USACom Resources Inc, Baton Rouge, LA USAFlorida Int Univ, Inst Water & Environm, Southeast Environm Res Ctr, Miami, FL 33199 USA",JacobsCoastal Protect & Restorat AuthorCom Resources Inc,,,2019-10-22,WOS:000489190500031,,

Additionally, the interaction between the casing string system and seabed soils below the mudline generates a force known as the foundation pressure. These two forces-particularly the mass force of the wellhead-lead to system instability. According to the Hamilton principle combined with functional analysis, the continuous virtual work done by the system mass force on the whole system during the deflection process is the major consideration because it increases the instability of the system. Therefore, a dynamic differential equation was established, followed by the finite-element discretisation of the casing system. Then, a dynamic equation was derived, and MATLAB was used to solve this equation. Furthermore, a dynamic performance simulation test of a shallow casing string was conducted by applying two types of seabed soils: two-layer soil and single-layer soil (homogeneous clay).

To examine this damping effect of sea ice on the astronomical tides in the Bohai Sea, where sea ice is common in winter, this study has developed a three-dimensional ice-ocean coupled model with and without sea ice to investigate potential changes in astronomical tides based on the Finite Volume Community Ocean Model (FVCOM). This newly developed model was first evaluated against field observations and remote sensing images, including water elevations and sea ice cover, and showed good agreement between the modelling results and the observed data. In using the air forcing data (2009-2010) and the default sea ice drag coefficient of 0.0075, the model results show that in the presence of sea ice, the major tidal constituent M-2 is reduced by 1 cm at the top of the three bays (from north to south: Liaodong Bay, Bohai Bay and Laizhou Bay) in the Bohai Sea, but the tidal phase is almost not affected. A sensitivity run shows that the amplitude of M-2 is decreased by 2 cm when increasing the drag coefficient from 0.005 to 0.01. Moreover, two extreme combinations of air temperatures and winds are simulated according to the standard deviation of wind speed and temperature over the past ten years, and the damping effects of sea ice on tides are almost negligible as well. Based on the water mass analysis, it is found that both the decreases of average volumetric flow rate for inflow and outflow due to ice through the three bays are relatively small compared to the average volumetric flow rate without ice. The convergence of the cross sectional area increases the tidal amplitude of M-2, which compensates the damping effect caused by sea ice.",,,,,,,,,9,5,0,0,2,0,13,,,0029-8018,,,,,,,,,,,"Tianjin Chengjian Univ, Tianjin Key Lab Soft Soil Characterist & Engn Env, Tianjin 300384, Peoples R ChinaUniv Houston, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Houston, TX 77204 USAFisheries & Oceans Canada, Bedford Inst Oceanog, Ocean & Ecosyst Sci Div, Dartmouth, NS B2Y 4A2, CanadaTianjin Univ, State Key Lab Hydraul Engn Simulat & Safety, Tianjin 300072, Peoples R ChinaNatl Marine Data & Informat Serv, Tianjin 300171, Peoples R ChinaLudong Univ, Inst Ports & Coasts Disaster Mitigat, Yantai 264025, Peoples R China",,,,2019-03-19,WOS:000460709700057,,

The sensitivity of sound to the void fraction of gas present in the seagrass meadow was established by the narrow marginal probability distributions that provided distinct estimates of the void fraction between the two sites.

This study bridges this gap and presents pioneering research in the application of fiber optic sensing for monitoring gas in riser. The proposed sensing paradigm was validated through well-scale experiments conducted at Petroleum Engineering Research & Technology Transfer lab (PERTT) facility at Louisiana State University (LSU), simulating an offshore marine riser environment with its larger than average annular space and mud circulation capability. The experimental setup instrumented with distributed fiber optic sensors and pressure/temperature gauges provides a physical model to study the dynamic gas migration in full-scale annular conditions. Current kick detection methods primarily utilize surface measurements and do not always reliably detect a gas influx. The proposed application of distributed fiber optic sensing overcomes this key limitation of conventional kick detection methods, by providing real-time distributed downhole data for accurate and reliable monitoring. The two-phase flow experiments conducted in this research provide critical insights for understanding the flow dynamics in offshore drilling riser conditions, and the results provide an indication of how quickly gas can migrate in a marine riser scenario, warranting further investigation for the sake of effective well control.",,,,,,,,,25,3,0,0,1,0,26,,,,1424-8220,,,,,,,,,,"Louisiana State Univ, Dept Petr Engn, Baton Rouge, LA 70803 USASchlumberger, Sugar Land, TX 77478 USASchlumberger Canada, Calgary, AB T2G 0P6, Canada",,,,2020-02-13,WOS:000510493100267,31906506,

The uncertainty of the storage capacity of geological reservoirs for sequestering carbon dioxide has been noted as an important issue in the deployment and cost of a CCS infrastructure. To analyse the relationships between these strategies and the uncertainty of the storage capacity of reservoirs, we propose a novel stochastic mixed-integer linear optimisation model. It minimises investment and construction costs and the costs of capture, transport, and storage of CO2 plus the cost of emitting CO2 to the atmosphere. The model considers technical and economic aspects to resolve both CO2 pricing and the design of a supply chain network for capturing, transporting, and sequestering CO2 in geological reservoirs. We present results for a sample case from the Brazilian cement industry using a CO2 tax as currently established in other countries. We verify that, while the CO2 tax increases, it also increases the complexity of the pipeline network of the supply chain and the amount of CO2 that is captured and stored. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

The theory of plate tectonics is the largest influence in expanding our vision of marine minerals and in developing our understanding of geologic controls of mineralization in space and time. Prior to the advent of plate tectonics, we viewed the ocean basins as passive sinks that served as containers for particulate and dissolved material eroded from land. This view adequately explained marine placer deposits (heavy minerals and gems), aggregates (sand and gravel), and precipitates (phosphorites and manganese nodules). Although numerous sites of placer mineral deposits are known on continental shelves worldwide, current activity pertains to diamond mining off southwestern Africa, tin mining off southeastern Asia, and intermittent gold mining off northwestern North America, which are all surpassed economically by worldwide recovery of marine sand and gravel, in turn dwarfed by offshore oil and gas. With the advent of plate tectonics, plate boundaries in ocean basins are recognized as active sources of mineralization in the form of hydrothermal massive sulfide deposits and proximal lower-temperature deposits hosted in oceanic crust (mafic at ocean ridges and felsic at volcanic island arcs), and of magmatic Ni-Cu sulfide, chromite and PGE deposits inferred to be present in the oceanic upper mantle-lower crust based on their occurrence in ophiolites. Some 300 sites of hydrothermal active and relict mineralization, most of them minor, are known at this early stage of seafloor exploration on ocean ridges, in fore-arc volcanoes, at back-arc spreading axes, and in arc rifts; deposits formed at spreading axes and transported off-axis by spreading are present in oceanic lithosphere but are virtually unknown. The TAG (Trans-Atlantic Geotraverse) hydrothermal field in the axial valley of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge (latitude 26 degrees N) is considered to exemplify a major Volcanogenic Massive Sulfide (VMS) deposit forming at a spreading axis. The most prospective of these occurrences lie within the 200 nautical mile (370 km)-wide Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) of the nations of the volcanic island arcs of the western Pacific where metal content of massive sulfides (Ag, Au, Ba, Cu, Pb, Sb, Zn) exceeds that at ocean ridges. Plate tectonics early provided a framework for mineralization on the scale of global plate boundaries and is providing guidance to gradually converge on sites of mineralization through regional scales of plate reorganization, with the potential to elucidate the occurrence of individual deposits (e.g., Eocene Carlin-type gold deposits). Investigation of the spectrum of marine minerals as active analogs of types of ancient mineral deposits is contributing to this convergence. Consideration of questions posed by Brian Skinner (1997) of what we do and do not know about ancient hydrothermal mineral deposits demonstrates the ongoing advances in understanding driven by investigation of marine minerals.

Such implications have prompted many governments globally to advocate for the adoption of renewable energy systems in order to reduce GHG emissions. While renewable energy technologies such as solar and biogases have been thoroughly researched and deployed, tidal current turbines (TCTs) that harness kinetic energy from the lateral movement of the tides are a comparatively emerging renewable energy technology, and thus has received relatively less attention with respect to their potential to supplement the renewable energy transition. This paper examines the physics behind tidal movements and cycles, and the technological operation of TCTs. Environmental impacts and economic barriers are analyzed. Best practices of MSP from world leading nations are examined, along with current deploy-andmonitor-consenting regimes of TCT test facilities. An optimal TCT design is suggested based on a synthesis of information from proceeding sections. Finally, an analysis of the implementation of TCTs in Canada, China, and Norway is presented, the results of which demonstrate that harnessing the accessible and sustainably extractable resource of each nation can result in an aggregate installed capacity of 9076 MW through the deployment of 7564 TCTs at a cost of $5,740,964,430, thereby creating 14,467 jobs.

Based on the 71-year (1945-2015) TC data in the Northwest Pacific (NWP) by the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) of US, a notable growth of the TC intensity is observed in the context of climate change. The fact implies that the traditional stationary model might be incapable of predicting parameters in the extreme events. Therefore, a non-stationary model is proposed in this study to estimate extreme wind speed in the South China Sea (SCS) and NWP. We find that the extreme wind speeds of different return periods exhibit an evident enhancement trend, for instance, the extreme wind speeds with different return periods by nonstationary model are 4.1%-4.4% higher than stationary ones in SCS. Also, the spatial distribution of extreme wind speed in NWP has been examined with the same methodology by dividing the west sea areas of the NWP 0 degrees-45 degrees N, 105 degrees E-130 degrees E into 45 subareas of 5 degrees x 5 degrees, where oil and gas resources are abundant. Similarly, remarkable spacial in-homogeneity in the extreme wind speed is seen in this area: the extreme wind speed with 50-year return period in the subarea (15 degrees N-20 degrees N, 115 degrees E-120 degrees E) of Zhongsha and Dongsha Islands is 73.8 m/s, while that in the subarea of Yellow Sea (30 degrees N-35 degrees N, 120 degrees E-125 degrees E) is only 47.1 m/s. As a result, the present study demonstrates that non-stationary and in-homogeneous effects should be taken into consideration in the estimation of extreme wind speed. (C) 2016 The Authors.

A considerable part of the released fuel oil reached the Galician coast, causing a heavy black tide and an ecological disaster. Although the black tide did not reach the NW coast of Portugal, it is possible that some of the fuel oil or its components also arrived to this area directly through the sea water and/or indirectly through the food chain. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate possible changes in two widely used biomarkers, the activity of the enzymes cholinesterases (ChE) and glutathione S-transferases (GST), of three molluscs (Mytilus galloprovincialis, Nucella lapillus and Monodonta lineata) from wild populations of the NW Portuguese coast in relation to the 'Prestige' oil spill. Molluscs were collected seasonally before (autumn 2002) and after (winter 2002/2003), spring and summer 2003) the oil spill at several sites along the Portuguese NW coast. Enzymatic activities determined before the accident were compared with those determined at different times after the oil spill taking into consideration abiotic factors. Information from different parameters was integrated by Redundancy Analysis and Principal Response Curves (PRC). Results show that GST and ChE activities were influenced by abiotic factors. Despite this influence, the results of PRC analysis also suggest that some of the fuel oil reached the NW Portuguese coast changing the patterns of ChE and GST activities of local populations of rocky shore species. Furthermore, the present study highlights the need of long-term monitoring with wild populations to assess both historical and punctual effects of pollution in the marine environment.

Jack-up rigs are founded on the seabed before start of operation to receive sufficient stability and to reduce wave induced influences. One possible foundation for jack-up rigs on the seabed is the so-called spudcan. A spudcan is a circular foundation attached to the legs of the jack-up rig to transfer the vertical loads into the ground. The use of spudcan-foundations is state-of-the-art in the oil- and gas industry. Nevertheless, the design of this type of foundation is still challenging. For example, the correct determination of the load-settlement-response with respect to different soil conditions is complex and the definition of the safe side is not always clear. Another problem related to the spudcan depositioning onto layered soil is the so-called punch-through-failure. This means that during installation onto dense sand overlying weak clay the spudcan may suddenly punch through the sand layer into the weaker layer. This can even lead to a total loss of the jack-up rig. In this contribution, different methods for spudcan design recommended in literature and international guidelines are summarized. Furthermore, open questions and results of ongoing research are discussed to give the reader an impression of the capabilities and the difficulties regarding spudcan foundations.",,,,,,,,,3,0,0,0,0,0,3,,,0932-8351,,,,,,,,,,,"Tech Univ Hamburg, Inst Geotech & Baubetrieb, D-21073 Hamburg, Germany",,,,2012-12-01,WOS:000312137300002,,

Biomass energy combined with Carbon Capture and Storage (BECCS) is the negative emission technology (NET) given most attention in a number of integrated assessment model studies and in the latest IPCC reports. However, less attention has been given to governance aspects of NETs. This study aims to identify pragmatic ways forward for BECCS, through synthesizing the literature relevant to accounting and rewarding BECCS, and its relation to the Paris Agreement. BECCS is divided into its two elements: biomass and CCS. Calculating net negative emissions requires accounting for sustainability and resource use related to biomass energy production, processing and use, and interactions with the global carbon cycle. Accounting for the CCS element of BECCS foremost relates to the carbon dioxide capture rate and safe underground storage. Rewarding BECCS as a NET depends on the efficiency of biomass production, transport and processing for energy use, global carbon cycle feedbacks, and safe storage of carbon dioxide, which together determine net carbon dioxide removal from the atmosphere. Sustainable biomass production is essential, especially with regard to trade-offs with competing land use. Negative emissions have an added value compared to avoided emissions, which should be reflected in the price of negative emission 'credits', but must be discounted due to global carbon cycle feedbacks. BECCS development will depend on linkages to carbon trading mechanisms and biomass trading. Key policy insights A standardized framework for sustainable biomass should be adopted. Countries should agree on a standardized framework for accounting and rewarding BECCS and other negative emission technologies. Early government support is indispensable to enable BECCS development, scale-up and business engagement. BECCS projects should be designed to maximize learning across various applications and across other NETs.

There is considerable concern regarding the efficiency of these tools considering how they are developed, implemented, integrated. The hypothesis is that frequently the attributes and criteria that define management do not stem from data that consider goods and ecosystem services and local practices. Instead, they are established based on few scientific knowledge, enabling decisions to be influenced by political-economic interests, ignoring enhanced attributes and criteria. The Araçá Bay (São Sebastião-SP) was chosen in order to test the hypothesis, because at the same time it assembles essential social-ecological attributes for goods and services maintenance, it is been strongly threatened by the expansion of port activities, beside oil and gas production. The Araçá Bay is included into the Marine Protected Area of Northern Coast (APAMLN) and where Project Biota Araçá-FAPESP has been producing detailed scientific data since 2012. This research aims to analyze the use of scientific and ethnoecological data during the historical and recent process of marine-coastal planning of two management policies in the Northern Coast of São Paulo (ZEEM/GERCO-LN e APAMLN), with comprehensive focus on Araçá Bay. As result, we expect to have a framework of indicators of social-ecological resilience in marine-coastal environments based on the ecosystem goods and services surveyed by the Project Biota Araçá-FAPESP and based on criteria and attributes of marine-coastal planning and management emerged in local knowledge, as well as those found in management policies and those reported by the international literature, thus, providing data and guidelines for Sustainable Local Development Plan of Araçá Bay (SLDP).

They found refuge in a makeshift camp, where they lived for about one year. During their stay, the men from Haarlem came into contact with indigenous people. Although initially marked by apprehension and reservation, these contacts improved after some time. This led to regular bartering, visits to each other's abodes, basic exchange of language and appreciation of each other's cultures. Upon returning to the Netherlands, the men reported favourably of their experiences. As a result, VOC management decided to establish a much-needed stopover for their ships. This station, known as the 'Tavern of the Seas', later developed into the city of Cape Town. The wrecking of Haarlem can thus be regarded as the catalyst that created one of the roots of current multiracial and multicultural South African society.",,,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,,,0025-3359,2049-680X,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Cape Town, Cape Town, South AfricaAIMURE, Cape Town, South AfricaUniv Pretoria, Dept Hist & Heritage Studies, Pretoria, South Africa",AIMURE,,,2018-02-01,WOS:000422918700003,,

Proposed platform consists of a deck, which is connected to six buoyant leg structures (BLSs) through the hinged joints while BLS units are connected to the seabed using taut-mooring tethers. The conceived structural form is a hybrid concept, which restrains transfer of both rotational and translational responses from the BLS units to the deck and vice versa. The main advantage is the improved functionality in terms of increase in the storage and regasification capacity of liquefied natural gas. Experimental investigations are carried out on a scaled model of BLSRP (1:150) under regular waves for two different wave approach angles. Free vibration tests are carried out on the scaled model to estimate the natural periods; results show that BLSRP resembles a tethered compliant structure like tension leg platform (TLP) except showing relatively higher stiffness in the yaw degree-of-freedom. Geometric design of BLS units ensures a good recentring capability of the deck in all the translational degrees-of-freedom. Lesser heave response of deck, in comparison to that of the BLS units ensures comfortable and safe operability.

In a holistic context these habitats are considered to be dynamic associations of macrohabitats and micro-habitats, interacting through time to affect the quantity (Q(1)), quality (Q(2)), and timing (T) of material and energy transfer within the system. Where data are available, this holistic approach (Q(1), Q(2), and T or Q(2)T) allows impacts to be evaluated in a multidimensional framework of time and space. Unfortunately, few data are available to evaluate the long-term implications of timing, the T factor. Recorded observations of most estuarine systems cover tens of years, periods not extensive enough to assess long-term changes to the environment or to distinguish man's impacts from those of nature. Sustained droughts, for example, can cause massive disruption in estuaries, altering habitats and species composition. When these changes occur over periods of 5-10 yr; the changes are difficult to identify and may be attributed to man's activities rather than nature's. Using the Hudson River estuary as an example, we have knowledge of historical impacts extending back to the 1700s, ranging from dredging to major droughts. For the Hudson River, recorded observations of rainfall and river flow extend back about 70 yr; however, tree rings provide a more extensive record since tree growth increments are directly dependent upon rainfall. The Hudson River drought record was extended back to 1694 using tree rings. Using the reconstructed record, the relationship between today's conditions-now and average location of the ocean-derived salt front-can be placed in a historical context. This historical perspective allo ccs us to place present-day human impacts into the context of long-term natural impacts and to discriminate among these effects.

Therefore, research on the influence of seawater on soft rock softening has great significance for the application of soft rock in marine engineering. To examine the softening mechanism of soft rock under seawater conditions, two kinds of soft rock softening experiments, as well as ion inhibition tests of soft rock softening, were performed under seawater and pure water conditions, and the results were compared. The variation in the soft rock composition, the deformation and failure characteristics of soft rock under the influence of sea water, and the variation in main cations in the softening process of soft rock are examined successively; the influences of different ions on soft rock softening are further analysed. Based on the analyses, the softening mechanism and control method of soft rock under sea water conditions are expounded. The study showed that soft rock softening was inhibited by seawater, which decreased the softening degree of soft rock. The main cations in seawater had an inhibitory effect on soft rock softening, and the order of inhibition was Ca2+ > Mg2+ > Na+. According to the inhibitory effect of ions on soft rock softening, we propose that seawater or calcium salt should be added to reduce the softening of soft rock in soft rock engineering and improve the mechanical strength of soft rock; in addition, soft rock can be considered a raw material in marine engineering. The experimental results have great significance for studies of the disintegration mechanism and inhibitory rules of soft rock under the influence of seawater and provide a theoretical basis for the application of soft rock in marine engineering, such as in artificial reef engineering and coastal dike engineering.",,,,,,,,,12,2,0,0,0,0,14,,,,2077-1312,,,,,,,,,,"Sun Yat Sen Univ, Sch Civil Engn, Zhuhai 519082, Peoples R ChinaSun Yat Sen Univ, Res Ctr Geotech Engn & Informat Technol, Guangzhou 510275, Guangdong, Peoples R ChinaGuangdong Engn Res Ctr Major Infrastruct Safety, Guangzhou 510275, Guangdong, Peoples R ChinaSun Yat Sen Univ, Sch Marine Sci, Zhuhai 519082, Peoples R China",Guangdong Engn Res Ctr Major Infrastruct Safety,,,2019-08-16,WOS:000478581900033,,

This marine heatwave and others have resulted in a heightened awareness of their potential impacts and prompted questions about if and when they may be predictable. Here, we use output from an ensemble of global climate forecast systems to document which aspects of the 2014-2016 CCS heatwave were predictable and how forecast skill, or lack thereof, relates to mechanisms driving the heatwaves evolution. We focus on four prominent SSTa changes within the 2014-2016 period: (i) the initial onset of anomalous warming in early 2014, (ii) a second rapid SSTa increase in late 2014, (iii) a sharp reduction and subsequent return of warm SSTa in mid-2015, and (iv) another anomalous warming event in early 2016. Models exhibited clear forecast skill for the first and last of these fluctuations, but not the two in the middle. Taken together with the state of knowledge on the dominant forcing mechanisms of this heatwave, our results suggest that CCS SSTa forecast skill derives from predictable evolution of pre-existing SSTa to the west (as in early 2014) and the south (as in early 2016), while the inability of models to forecast wind-driven SSTa in late 2014 and mid-2015 is consistent with the lack of a moderate or strong El Nino or La Nina event preceding those periods. The multi-model mean forecast consistently outperformed a damped persistence forecast, especially during the period of largest SSTa, and skillful CCS forecasts were generally associated with accurate representation of large-scale dynamics. Additionally, a large forecast ensemble (85 members) indicated elevated probabilities for observed SSTa extremes even when ensemble mean forecasts exhibited limited skill. Our results suggest that different types or aspects of marine heatwaves are more or less predictable depending on the forcing mechanisms at play, and events that are consistent with predictable ocean responses could inform ecosystem-based management of the ocean.

Breaking waves disperse oil from a surface slick into the water column as droplets of varying sizes. Oil droplets undergo further breakup and coalescence in the water column due to the turbulence. Available models simulate oil DSD based on empirical/equilibrium equations. However, the oil DSD evolution due to subsequent droplet breakup and coalescence in the water column can be best represented by a dynamic population model. This paper develops a phenomenological model to calculate the oil DSD in wave breaking conditions and ocean turbulence and is based on droplet breakup and coalescence. Its results are compared with data from laboratory experiments that include different oil types, different weathering times, and different breaking wave heights. The model comparisons showed a good agreement with experimental data. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Furthermore, the velocity only affected the horizontal offset, and the overall effect was not noticeable.

Cores were recovered with a manned submersible from fine-grained sediments containing dispersed gas hydrates at the threshold of stability. Estimated sulfate reduction rates are variable but generally are substantially higher in crude oil seeps (up to 50 times) and methane seeps (up to 600 times) relative to a non-seep reference sediment (0.0043 mu mol SO42- cm(-3) day(-1)). Sulfur and oxygen isotope fractionation factors are highest in the reference sediment (alpha(S) = 1.027; alpha(O) = 1.015) but substantially lower in the seep sediments (alpha(S) = 1.018 to 1.009; alpha(O) = 1.006 to 1.002) and are controlled primarily by kinetic factors related to sulfate reduction rates.

Areas of particular concern identified in the Interim Guidance Notes were two-phase jet fires, the effect of confinement on jet fires and their behaviour with water deluge. Since that time a considerable body of experimental research has been undertaken. Based on this recent data, this paper reassesses jet fire hazards in an offshore environment and provides updated guidance on the hazards they pose, including tabulated data and simple calculation techniques for predicting jet fire hazards.",,,,,,,,,72,5,0,0,5,0,76,,,0957-5820,,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Loughborough, Dept Chem Engn, Loughborough LE11 3TU, Leics, EnglandAdvantica Ltd, Loughborough, Leics, EnglandShell Global Solut, Chester, Cheshire, England",Advantica Ltd,,,2007-05-01,WOS:000246742300002,,

Particular attention is given to the changes in the nature of exposure and control of inhalation risks from substances hazardous to health in the UK sector, but other risks (e.g. dermatitis, noise and vibration) are also considered. The amount of published information on exposure to these hazards in the sector, or indeed on long-term health outcomes of working offshore, is limited. The approach taken to occupational health and hygiene in the sector has to be set in the context of the challenge of working in a remote and hostile environment where attention to safety and the need for emergency response to acute, rather than chronic, medical events are vital. However, changes in attitudes towards occupational health in the sector, legislation, the impact of environmental protection requirements and technology have all contributed to increasing the attention given to assessment and control of chemical and physical hazards. The health risks and benefits associated with the abandonment of installations, the application of new technologies, recovery of oil from ever deeper waters, lower staffing levels, environmental changes, the. ageing workforce and the recognition of exposure patterns needing further attention/control (sequential multiple exposures, smaller workforce, peak/short-term exposures, etc.) are other current and future occupational hygiene challenges.",,,,,5th International Conference of the International-Occupational-Hygiene-Association5th International Conference of the International-Occupational-Hygiene-Association,"JUN, 2002JUN, 2002",Int Occupat Hygiene AssocInt Occupat Hygiene Assoc,"BERGEN, NORWAYBERGEN, NORWAY",58,1,0,0,19,2,63,,,0003-4878,,,,,,,,,,,"Hlth & Safety Execut, Hazardous Ind Directorate, Offshore Div, Bootle L20 3DL, Merseyside, England",Hlth & Safety Execut,,,2003-04-01,WOS:000182119200004,12639833,

The framework consists of the evacuation protective layers and the evacuation preparedness plan. Human and organizational factors are discussed and analyzed at different stages, that is, the organization, personnel's competence, the evacuation procedures, and the emergency equipment. As a result, insufficient emergency drills and exercises, poor communications, impairment of personnel's physical ability due to unsafe conditions, and poor emergency preparedness planning were identified as human and organizational factors contributing to the unsuccessful evacuation operations of the Macondo well blowout",,,,,,,,,28,2,0,0,2,0,35,,,0925-7535,1879-1042,,,,,,,,,,"Mem Univ Newfoundland, Fac Engn & Appl Sci, St John, NF A1B 3X5, CanadaMem Univ Newfoundland, Sch Human Kinet & Recreat, St John, NF A1B 3X5, Canada",,,,2014-11-19,WOS:000343361400005,,

The microclimatic data indicated that the effect of OTCs was dependent on microtopography. During winter, two short-term snow-thaw episodes occurred, so that liquid water was available for the Nostoc communities. Because of the warming, the OTC hummock bases remained unfrozen three weeks longer in comparison to the CCSs and, in spring, the OTC hummock tops and bases exceeded 0 degrees C several days earlier than CCS ones. Mean summer temperature differences were 1.6 degrees C in OTC and CCS hummock tops, and 0.3 degrees C in the OTC and CCS hummock bases. The hummock tops were drier than their bases; however the VWC difference between the OTCs and CCSs was small. Due to the only minor differences in the microclimate of OTC and CCS hummock bases, where the Nostoc colonies were located, no differences in ecophysiological characteristics of Nostoc colonies expressed as photochemistry parameters and nitrogenase activities were detected after two years exposition.

The collected data was used to validate a hydro-morphodynamic model, allowing the selection of the installation area based on both operational and environmental constraints. Operational results related to the description of power generation capacity, energy capture area and proportion of energy flux are presented and discussed, including the failures occurring during the experimental setup. The data is now available to the scientific community and to TEC industry developers, enhancing the operational knowledge of TEC technology concerning efficiency, environmental effects, and interactions (i.e. device/environment). The results can be used by developers on the licensing process, on overcoming the commercial deployment barriers, on offering extra assurance and confidence to investors, who traditionally have seen environmental concerns as a barrier, and on providing the foundations whereupon similar deployment areas can be considered around the world for marine tidal energy extraction.

The traditional method for assessment of the wind resource for wind energy application is through analysis of wind speed and wind direction observed during one or more years at a meteorological mast equipped with well-calibrated anemometers at several levels. The cost of such measurements is very high and therefore they are only sparsely available. An alternative method is the application of satellite remote sensing. Comparison of wind resource statistics from satellite products is presented and discussed including the uncertainty on the wind resource. The diurnal wind variability is found to be negligible at some location but up to 0.5 m s(-1) at two sites. Synergetic use of observations from multiple satellites in different orbits provides wind observations at six times in the diurnal cycle and increases the number of observations. At Horns Rev M2, FINO1 and Greater Gabbard satellite and in situ collocated samples show differences in mean wind speed of -2%, -1% and 3%, respectively. At Egmond aan Zee the difference is 10%. It is most likely due to scatterometer data sampled further offshore than at the meteorological mast. Comparing energy density with all samples at Horns Rev M2 shows overestimation 7-19% and at FINO1 underestimation 2-5% but no clear conclusion can be drawn as the comparison data are not collocated. At eight new offshore wind farm areas in Denmark, the variability in mean energy density observed by SAR ranges from 347 W m(-2) in Sejerobugten to 514 W m(-2) at Horns Rev 3. The spatial variability in the near-shore areas is much higher than at areas located further offshore. (C) 2014 DTU Wind Energy.

However, submarine flows are more episodic and are typically more violent (with speeds of up to 20m/s) than river floods. Moreover, a single submarine flow is capable of transporting ten times the annual sediment load from all of the world's rivers combined. Submarine flows are important because they produce many of the world's most extensive and voluminous sedimentary deposits, both on the modern sea floor and in the ancient rock record, but also because they can break seafloor cables that now carry over 95% of global data traffic (that underpin our daily lives through the internet and financial markets). Ancient submarine flows created subsurface rock sequences that contain many of our largest oil and gas reserves. Submarine flows carve canyons, which are deeper than the Grand Canyon, through processes that are still poorly understood, and flows within canyons play a key role in supplying organic carbon and nutrients to benthic ecosystem (that include important diversity hotspots) in the deep sea.The most remarkable aspect of submarine density flows is how difficult they are to monitor directly, and how few observations we presently have of such flows in action. This paucity of direct observation provides a stark contrast to the information available for other major sediment transport processes. Changes in the frontal speed of submarine flows have been measured in just five locations, mainly through indirect evidence provided by the timing of sequential underwater cable breaks. Their vertical velocity profile has only ever been measured in three locations and never with sampling rates more frequent than one per hour. No flow has been monitored along its full path, which is of key importance because flows evolve considerably in character along that path.To produce a fundamental step-change in our understanding of submarine flows we need to directly monitor active flows along their entire flow path. Until this is achieved, our understanding of the flow character and its spatial evolution will remain limited. This project will provide by far the most detailed monitoring data yet collected for submarine flows: be the first that places constraints on both dilute and dense near-bed flow components, be the first data set that spans the full flow path, and be the first data set to link measurements of flow processes and the resulting deposit character in such an environment. We aim to conduct a large-scale collaborative program to document and understand sediment transport processes occurring within Monterey Canyon offshore California during an 18-month period in 2014-16, in collaboration with the Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute (MBARI) and US Geological Survey (USGS). Such international collaboration is essential for spreading the cost of this ambitious work. MBARI are providing the project with access to a series of innovative tools for monitoring flows that MBARI have designed, built and field tested over the last decade; a contribution worth over $10 Million. This includes aBenthic Instrument Nodes for their Monterey Ocean Observing System that will provide the first high frequency (every 2 to 30 seconds rather than hourly) measurements of 3D velocity, temperature, salinity and density profiles from such flows. MBARI also provide access to the research vessels and ROVs necessary for equipment deployment and servicing during this 18 month period, as MBARI is located at the head of the canyon. MBARI and USGS will place further monitoring equipment in the canyon as part of the project that is worth a further $1.5 Million. Moreover, the MBARI and USGS bear the risk for the loss of all of their equipment.

Rich var. distichurm Nyssa aquatica L) stand density on the Mississippi River delta using a multitemporal ordination of reflectance from Landsat Thematic Mapper imagery. Approximately 29, 50, and 21% of forest was classified as full canopy, intermediate, and open canopy, respectively. We estimate stand-level live-stem carbon stocks and annual accumulation rates of 96, 67, and 39 t-C ha(-1) and 1.9, 1.4 and 0.8 t-C ha(-1) yr(-1) for full-canopy, intermediate, and open-canopy forest, respectively. Regional live-stem carbon stocks are similar to 69 t-C ha(-1), and total carbon and annual increment for all forest analyzed are similar to 17 Mt-C and similar to 0.34 Mt-C yr-1. Much of the cypress-tupelo forest on the delta stores carbon at rates significantly below the potential of fully stocked stands, yet overall rates of accumulation are comparable to other forest types and coastal systems. Delta-wide, there is a well-defined coastward gradient of stand density, which has important implications for the future of deltaic forests and their ecosystem services. The similarities between forest density gradients and well-documented marsh loss patterns in the region suggest that the same processes driving coastal marsh loss-relative sea level rise exacerbated by human activity-are likely responsible for a second, more gradual interface of land loss at the marsh-forest boundary.

Outcome measures included speed and accuracy of response to situation awareness questions presented orally during three separate simulation freezes, and self-rating of performance.Results: Results indicate that the type of ERFB display significantly influenced the speed and accuracy of responses. Qualitative results indicate that situation awareness was increased when using the dynamic ERFB.Conclusions: It can be concluded that the dynamic ERFB offers an objective measure of performance and as a consequence, it is recommended that dynamic ERFBs be implemented into future offshore emergency response assessment training.Relevance to industry: Given the enormous amount of information available during an emergency, the dynamic ERFB offers an improved system for data logging, consolidation of information, and greater comprehension of relevant resource allocation factors.

J,,,,,,,,,Peter Talling,,First detailed synchronous sediment-concentration and velocity data for submarine turbidity currents,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Awarded Grant,May 08 2014,2014,"Submarine sediment density flows (turbidity currents) and rivers on land are volumetrically the most important processes for moving sediment across our planet. However, submarine flows are more episodic and are typically more violent (with speeds of up to 20m/s) than river floods. Moreover, a single submarine flow is capable of transporting ten times the annual sediment load from all of the world's rivers combined. Submarine flows are important because they produce many of the world's most extensive and voluminous sedimentary deposits, both on the modern sea floor and in the ancient rock record, but also because they can break seafloor cables that now carry over 95% of global data traffic (that underpin our daily lives through the internet and financial markets). Ancient submarine flows created subsurface rock sequences that contain many of our largest oil and gas reserves. Submarine flows carve canyons, which are deeper than the Grand Canyon, through processes that are still poorly understood, and flows within canyons play a key role in supplying organic carbon and nutrients to benthic ecosystem (that include important diversity hotspots) in the deep sea.The most remarkable aspect of submarine density flows is how difficult they are to monitor directly, and how few observations we presently have of such flows in action. This paucity of direct observation provides a stark contrast to the information available for other major sediment transport processes. Changes in the frontal speed of submarine flows have been measured in just five locations, mainly through indirect evidence provided by the timing of sequential underwater cable breaks. Their vertical velocity profile has only ever been measured in three locations and never with sampling rates more frequent than one per hour. No flow has been monitored along its full path, which is of key importance because flows evolve considerably in character along that path.To produce a fundamental step-change in our understanding of submarine flows we need to directly monitor active flows along their entire flow path. Until this is achieved, our understanding of the flow character and its spatial evolution will remain limited. This project will provide by far the most detailed monitoring data yet collected for submarine flows: be the first that places constraints on both dilute and dense near-bed flow components, be the first data set that spans the full flow path, and be the first data set to link measurements of flow processes and the resulting deposit character in such an environment. We aim to conduct a large-scale collaborative program to document and understand sediment transport processes occurring within Monterey Canyon offshore California during an 18-month period in 2014-16, in collaboration with the Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute (MBARI) and US Geological Survey (USGS). Such international collaboration is essential for spreading the cost of this ambitious work. MBARI are providing the project with access to a series of innovative tools for monitoring flows that MBARI have designed, built and field tested over the last decade; a contribution worth over $10 Million. This includes aBenthic Instrument Nodes for their Monterey Ocean Observing System that will provide the first high frequency (every 2 to 30 seconds rather than hourly) measurements of 3D velocity, temperature, salinity and density profiles from such flows. MBARI also provide access to the research vessels and ROVs necessary for equipment deployment and servicing during this 18 month period, as MBARI is located at the head of the canyon. MBARI and USGS will place further monitoring equipment in the canyon as part of the project that is worth a further $1.5 Million. Moreover, the MBARI and USGS bear the risk for the loss of all of their equipment.

Seawater samples collected in 32 sampling sites were analyzed with the concentration measurement of 7 benzene and its derivatives (BTEXs) and 17 polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). A single and joint ecological risk assessment of studied chemicals was performed by risk quotient method and toxicity equivalent method. Our present results demonstrated that the total concentration of BTEXs ranged from 65.1 ng.L-1 to 222.6 ng.I:1 in the seawater of the study area, among which toluene was the highest one. Further-more, their concentration in surface water was slightly lower than that in the bottom, and the average concentration of them near the oil and gas areas was lower than the surroundings, which was affected by land-based inputs. The total concentration of PAHs in the surface seawater ranged from 98.9 ng.L-1 to 356.0 ng.L-1, with an average value of 184.5 ng.L-1. Compared with other regions, PAH pollution was generally at a medium level with the lower number ring ones as major components. The risk quotient method indicated that the PAHs in this area might mainly come from petroleum and its processed products. The risk quotient (RQ) of benzo(a)pyrene in the waters was higher than 0.1, showing a low risk, and the concentrations of the other three compounds were at an acceptable level. The joint ecological risk of the four aromatic hydrocarbons was low with the existence of some differences in different regions, which had potential adverse effects on the ecosystem.

The burgeoning discipline of the Energy Humanities has recently turned its attentions towards Scottish literature as a valuable area of study when contemplating the relationships between energy and cultural production. Most recently, scholars have focused their analysis on the histories of North Sea oil and gas production and have worked to juxtapose the long histories of land clearance in the Highlands and islands alongside contemporary narratives of exile and exploitation experienced by Scotland's coastal oil communities. The forms of spatial injustice incurred through the recent histories of what Derek Gladwin terms 'Oil Clearance' (Gladwin 2017) or Graeme Macdonald identifies as 'petro-marginalisation' (Macdonald 2015), is often solely registered through terrestrial environments. This article urges the adoption of an oceanic perspective, one which registers how the extractive politics of modern petroculture in Scotland not only presents major challenges for terrestrial environments and communities, but holds specific ramifications for the ways in which we currently imagine and interact with oceanic space. Indeed, as Macdonald has noted, the North Sea is in many ways 'wholly regarded as a productive environment of marine capitalism synonymous with oil' (2015). What does it mean to read the ocean through oil? By adopting an oceanic perspective, this article considers the ways in which the exploitative dynamics of offshore petroculture in the 1970s coincides with an incredibly damaging and problematic cultural construction of the ocean. But as Scotland moves towards a new era of low-carbon energy production, how might this construction of the ocean change? The closing half of this article considers the ways in which the extractivist histories and spatial injustices of petroculture are resisted through contemporary poetic engagements with new marine-based energy technologies, namely, wave and tidal power. In examining a range of work from artists and poets such as Alec Finlay, Laura Watts, Lila Matsumoto and Hannah Imlach, this article further argues that the recent turn towards marine renewables not only signals a new future for a low-carbon Scotland, but that the advent of renewable technologies provides contemporary poets with new materials through which to imagine alternative models of community, power, and relation in an era of environmental change.",,,,,,,,,10,0,0,0,0,0,10,,,,2076-0787,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Edinburgh, Sch Literatures Languages & Cultures, Edinburgh EH8 9LH, Midlothian, Scotland",,,,2019-03-01,WOS:000682985500016,,

Fourteen vessels fished a total of 168 days in the North Sea in 1997. In the wreck fishery the total effort was 1052 nets with active pingers, 1056 nets with dummy pingers and 74 nets without pingers. Eight porpoises were caught, all in nets with dummy pingers. In the flat bottom/stony ground fishery the total effort was 5596 nets with active pingers, 5210 nets with dummy pingers and 2973 nets without pingers. Sixteen porpoises were caught, including 1 animal in a net with active pingers, 6 in nets with dummy pingers and 9 in nets without pingers. The difference in bycatch between nets with active pingers and nets with inactive or no pingers was highly significant (p < 0.007) for both the wreck fishery and the flat bottom/stony ground fishery. We conclude that the direct effects of the pinger signals on the porpoises caused the reduction in bycatch, which means that the results can be generalized to other situations where harbour porpoises are taken in gillnets. Generalized linear modelling demonstrated that cod cpue was not affected negatively by pingers. It was furthermore estimated that the stony ground fishery had significantly lower (p < 0.001) cpue values (a factor 0.47) compared to the wreck fishery. The results of this experiment led to the introduction of pingers in Danish gillnet fisheries in 2001 and were also part of the basis for EU Council Regulation 812/2004 introducing EU-wide use of pingers.

According to previous studies, there is a sheer industrial need of an effective management information system for decision-making to prevent life-threatening accidents at oil and gas production sites based on innovative hazard controlling strategies from different production origins. Similarly, that safety and health management information system will also enhance the decision-making skills of oil and gas production crew through effective accident prevention strategies. Design/methodology/approach In this study, 100 drilling crew are randomly selected for quantitative research phase. Similarly, 3 safety experts are purposively selected for qualitative research from each drilling domain from Saudi Arabia, Malaysia and Pakistan, whereas for the identification of hazard controlling measures, what-if analysis and thematic analysis approaches are adopted. Furthermore, the educational management information system (HAZ-PRO) for safety and health has been developed by using ADDIE Model based. Whereas, Visual Studio (2017) and MySQL software are used for the database and user interface development of the safety and health management information system for the safety and health of production crew. Findings This study proposes the research framework for the development and implementation of a new safety and health educational management information system (HAZ-PRO) based on identified effective hazard controls and mitigating measures in support of accident prevention and effective decision-making in hazardous events at Saudi Arabian and Pakistani onshore and offshore production domains. Whereas, this proposed safety and health management information system will assist and facilitate the safety professionals and production crew to prevent the injuries in hazardous work environments of onshore and offshore oil and gas industries according to international safety standards. Practical implications This safety and health management information system can be utilized by oil and gas industries (oil and gas production crew) in Saudi Arabia, Malaysia and Pakistan for accident prevention and suitable decision-making prior to the actual onshore and offshore operations. Also, the proposed system development framework will be useful as an effective source for the elimination of life-threatening drilling hazards associated with its activities in oil and gas industries. Similarly, the proposed framework can also be implemented in other oil and gas work-based accident prevention and effective decision-making designs.

In this paper, we investigate the sequestration of CO2 in aquifers with the co-injection of surfactants for foam generation. This is equivalent to the use of foam for conformance control in enhanced oil recovery applications. To study foam-assisted sequestration, we extend an in-house streamline-based simulator to model foam flow. We use two foam models that have been previously suggested in the literature. In both models foam hinders gas mobility through increasing its apparent viscosity. The modified simulator is validated by comparison to analytical solutions. We then investigate the performance of CO2 sequestration with the co-injection of surfactants. We look at CO2 sequestration in a North Sea aquifer. We study both simultaneous and alternating surfactant-gas injection at different fractional flows (i.e. water:gas ratios). For cases where a seal provides a reliable trapping mechanism, the simulation results suggest that the use of surfactants to generate foam significantly improves the storage efficiency at a marginal increase in water consumption. In this setting, CO2/surfactant simultaneous injection at a 0.5 CO2 fractional flow was found to be the optimum injection strategy for the case investigated. To the contrary, if the seal is unreliable or not present at the first place, CO2/brine simultaneous injection at a 0.85 CO2 fractional flow was found to be the optimum injection strategy. Although foam-assisted sequestration in this case further improves the storage efficiency, it does that at a significant increase in water consumption. This is since, although foam generation improves the sweep during the sequestration phase, it significantly hinders the sweep during the chase-brine injection phase. Based on that, having a design where the surfactant will degrade just before or during the chase-brine injection phase would provide the optimum sequestration strategy without reliance on the presence or integrity of the seal.

It enables a smaller foundation footprint and so is a potential cost-saving alternative to conventionally engineered 'fixed' seabed foundations. Dominant sources of loading on subsea infrastructure arise from connection misalignment or thermal and pressure-induced expansion, and these are reduced if the structure is permitted to displace while ensuring that additional loading is not induced by excessive settlements. A sound prediction of the resulting sliding response will provide a robust design basis for mobile subsea infrastructure. This paper presents a theoretical model based on critical state soil mechanics to predict the performance of a subsea installation that is founded on soft, normally consolidated or lightly overconsolidated soil, and subjected to intermittent horizontal sliding movements. The framework is validated against centrifuge test results and is shown to capture the essential elements of the soil-structure interaction, which include: (a) the changing soil strength from cycles of sliding and pore pressure generation; (b) the regain in strength due to dissipation of excess pore pressure (consolidation); and (c) the soil contraction and consequent settlement of the foundation caused by the consolidation process.",,,,,,,,,15,0,0,0,0,0,15,,,0016-8505,1751-7656,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Western Australia, Ctr Offshore Fdn Syst M053, ARC Ctr Geotech Sci & Engn, Perth, WA, Australia",,,,2017-07-03,WOS:000403477200005,,

This bank is a structural high controlled by major faults with predominant N-S, NNE-SSW, and NNW-SEE trends. It is characterized by moderate to low seismic activity. The faults have controlled the local depositional architecture, deforming, fracturing, relocating and distributing sediments since the Valangian (early Cretaceous). The Prestige sinking area corresponds to an asymmetric half-graben structure with a N-S trend, which conditions the present-day morphology. The faulted flank outcrops and its activity and erosion have favoured the occurrence of mass-movements (slumps, slump debris, mass-flows and turbidity currents), building valleys and depositional lobes. Near-surface sediments comprise mostly terrigenous and biogenous turbiditic muds and sands with a minor presence of hemipelagic muds, except on the fault scarp where pelagites predominate.

For the long stroke cylinders used in the direct acting riser tensioning application the piston rod surface is exposed to severe degradation; combining corrosion, wear and mechanical stress. Direct acting riser tensioning systems are often used during ultra-deepwater offshore drilling, when exploring for oil and gas. These direct acting riser tensioning systems usually consist of 6 long stroke hydraulic cylinders located at the splash zone level. These cylinders ensure constant tensioning of the drilling riser as the drilling vessel is operated in ultra deep waters up to 3000 meters compensating for heave due to sea waves and tide.The direct acting tensioning systems have been in operation since the late 1990's, but the system integrity and service life has so far not been acceptable. Operational experience shows that the thermal sprayed coatings applied on these piston rods have dramatically shorter life than predicted by qualification tests programs. The consequence of the failing rod surface is sudden coating damage such as pits and flaking which further damages the seals in the packing flange. As a result hydraulic oil leakages occurs, thus polluting the environment and in the worst case leads to loss of the tensioning in the riser causing subsequent drilling down time and eventual riser breakage and blow-out.This paper will provide a generic summary of operational experience, development and degradation issues of direct-acting riser tensioning cylinder piston rod surfaces. Several case histories are included to highlight piston rod failures and an evaluation of alternative concepts to improve service life of piston rods is given.",,,,,"28th International Conference on Ocean, Offshore and Arctic Engineering28th International Conference on Ocean, Offshore and Arctic Engineering","MAY 31-JUN 05, 2009MAY 31-JUN 05, 2009","ASME, Ocean, Offshore & Arctic Engn DivASME, Ocean, Offshore & Arctic Engn Div","Honolulu, HIHonolulu, HI",4,0,0,0,0,0,4,,,,,978-0-7918-4346-8,,,,,,,,,"Natl Oilwell Norway AS, N-4604 Kristiansand, Norway",Natl Oilwell Norway AS,,,2009-01-01,WOS:000283008400001,,

Based on an offshore classification society, offshore pipeline failure statistics have been collected for more than 30 years and it is depicted that the pipeline predominantly fails as a result of corrosion. For the continuous safe operation, it is necessary in any damage to prevent either progressive failure or sudden collapse. The main aim of the present study is to investigate the detection and monitor of offshore pipeline damage from offshore platform operated in south china sea. This problem is addressed with the risk based inspection ( RBI) method. This paper presents a method which incorporates into the research area concerning the reliability, maintenance and inspection of pipeline in offshore production system.

The lack of quantitative data is explained by the complexity of hard-to-access fluvial-lake systems, low water transparency, and the elusive behavior of manatees. Side-scan sonar is a promissory tool to detect and count manatees in fluvial systems. The Pantanos de Centla Biosphere Reserve (PCBR), in the coastal plain of Tabasco (Mexico), could play a key role in the regional conservation of manatees, but it is under constant pressure, especially from the oil and gas industry, and it is important to generate quantitative data for this area. The objective of this study was to quantify the relative abundance of manatees at 4 selected sites within PCBR and at 2 reference sites outside the reserve using side-scan sonar, as a basis for the long-term monitoring of the species and to determine the importance of the reserve for regional manatee conservation. We conducted 5 to 7 boat surveys on 10-km line transects along selected water courses and recorded 63 manatee sightings. Manatees occurred at all sampling sites and abundance increased upriver. The site with the highest mean abundance (5.17 +/- 1.9 manatees/10 km) was located at the southeastern end of PCBR. There was statistical difference among sites. The southeastern portion of Tabasco is a key region for manatee conservation and management in Mexico.

During ReDAPT, a 1 MW commercial prototype tidal turbine was deployed and operated at the Fall of Warness tidal test site within the European Marine Energy Centre (EMEC), Orkney, U.K. Mean flow speeds and Turbulence Intensity (TI) at multiple positions proximal to the machine are considered. Through the implemented wave identification techniques, the dataset can be filtered into conditions where the effects of waves are present or absent. Due to the volume of results, only flow conditions in the absence of waves are reported here. The analysis shows that TI and mean flows are found to vary considerably between flood and ebb tides whilst exhibiting sensitivity to the tidal phase and to the specification of spatial averaging and velocity binning. The principal measurement technique was acoustic Doppler profiling provided by seabed-mounted Diverging-beam Acoustic Doppler Profilers (D-ADP) together with remotely-operable Single-Beam Acoustic Doppler Profilers (SB-ADP) installed at mid-depth on the tidal turbine. This novel configuration allows inter-instrument comparisons, which were conducted. Turbulence intensity averaged over the rotor extents of the ReDAPT turbine for flood tides vary between 16.7% at flow speeds above 0.3 m/s and 11.7% when considering only flow speeds in the turbine operating speed range, which reduces to 10.9% (6.8% relative reduction) following the implementation of noise correction techniques. Equivalent values for ebb tides are 14.7%, 10.1% and 9.3% (7.9% relative reduction). For flood and ebb tides, TI values resulting from noise correction are reduced in absolute terms by 3% and 2% respectively across a wide velocity range and approximately 1% for turbine operating speeds. Through comparison with SB-ADP-derived mid-depth TI values, this correction is shown to be conservative since uncorrected SB-ADP results remain, in relative terms, between 10% and 21% below corrected D-ADP values depending on tidal direction and the range of velocities considered. Results derived from other regions of the water column, those important to floating turbine devices for example, are reported for comparison.",,,,,,,,,39,1,0,0,0,0,41,,,,1996-1073,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Edinburgh, Inst Energy Syst, Sch Engn, Edinburgh EH9 3DW, Midlothian, Scotland",,,,2018-03-14,WOS:000424397600176,,

Atmospheric inputs of dissociation products of strong acids (HNO3 and H2SO4) and bases (NH3) alter surface seawater alkalinity, pH, and inorganic carbon storage. We quantify the biogeochemical impacts by using atmosphere and ocean models. The direct acid/base flux to the ocean is predominately acidic (reducing total alkalinity) in the temperate Northern Hemisphere and alkaline in the tropics because of ammonia inputs. However, because most of the excess ammonia is nitrified to nitrate (NO3-) in the upper ocean, the effective net atmospheric input is acidic almost everywhere. The decrease in surface alkalinity drives a net air-sea efflux Of CO2, reducing surface dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC); the alkalinity and DIC changes mostly offset each other, and the decline in surface pH is small. Additional impacts arise from nitrogen fertilization, leading to elevated primary production and biological DIC drawdown that reverses in some places the sign of the surface pH and air-sea CO2 flux perturbations. On a global scale, the alterations in surface water chemistry from anthropogenic nitrogen and sulfur deposition are a few percent of the acidification and DIC increases due to the oceanic uptake of anthropogenic CO2. However, the impacts are more substantial in coastal waters, where the ecosystem responses to ocean acidification could have the most severe implications for mankind.",,,,,,,,,282,13,0,0,169,0,324,,,0027-8424,,,,,,,,,,,"Woods Hole Oceanog Inst, Marine Chem & Geochem Dept, Woods Hole, MA 02543 USANatl Ctr Atmosp Res, Div Climate & Global Dynamics, Boulder, CO 80303 USANatl Ctr Atmospher Res, Div Atmospher Chem, Boulder, CO 80303 USANOAA, Pacific Marine Environm Lab, Seattle, WA 98115 USAUniv Hawaii Manoa, Sch Ocean & Earth Sci & Technol, Dept Oceanog, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA",,,,2007-09-11,WOS:000249513000009,17804807,

The RIFs are categorized into human elements, the installation and hazards. A step by step evacuation sequence is illustrated. The escape and evacuation sequence from the Deepwater Horizon offshore drilling platform is reviewed based on testimonies from the survivors. Although no casualties were reported as a result of the EER operations from the Deepwater Horizon, the number of survivors offers a limited insight into the level of success of the EER operations.

The potential energy of tides - the principal focus of the study, is stored due to rise and fall of the sea level. Head difference created due to tidal variation between basin side and sea side of a barrage stores potential energy which is converted into fast-moving water that rotates turbine and generates electricity. Bangladesh with its long coastline has promising prospects of tidal energy resource development. The study focuses on tidal energy resource exploration and exploitation along several competent locations of the Bengal coastline.

The present criteria of the offshore structure standards for seismic assessment can be improved using Building prestandards. Recently some documents such as FEMA-356 and ATC-40 are developed for seismic assessment of buildings. However there is advice in API documents (API RP 2A) in order for seismic assessment of jacket platforms, but because of brief existing comments in this field, it is necessary to use more appropriate (pre)standards for seismic assessment of these structures.

To avoid a dangerous collision with a large floating ice, ice management and risk mitigation plans are required firstly. In case of smaller ice pieces (or bergy bits), if they collide with an offshore platform, the combined load of bergy bits and waves may be larger than the typical design wave loads. Hence, it is necessary to predict how these bergy bits may interact with a platform in a given sea state to estimate the combined load for developing a reliable design. In this paper, dynamic interaction between a moving bergy bit and a fixed offshore platform is simulated using CFD (Computation Fluid Dynamics) method. Trajectories and velocities of ice are simulated and compared to understand the hydrodynamic interaction by applying a series of different wave conditions such as wave period, height and relative incident peak location.

Two MiniFluos can be installed on a glider, each equipped with two optical channels (one PAH is measured per channel). This setup allows the measurement of up to 4 different fluorescent PAHs: Naphthalene, Phenanthrene, Fluorene and Pyrene. Laboratory tests on oil products (Maya crude oil and Diesel fuel) as well as on marine samples near industrial areas (urban harbor and offshore installations) revealed that the concentration of the four PAHs targeted accounted for 62-97% of the total PAH concentration found in samples (Sigma 16 PAHs determined by standard international protocols). Laboratory tests also revealed that for marine applications, the calibration on Water Accommodated Fraction (WAF) of crude oil is more appropriate than the one on pure standards (STD). This is because PAH fluorescence is constituted in large part of alkylated compounds that are not considered with STD calibration. Results from three glider deployments with increasing levels of complexity (a laboratory trial, a field mission in non-autonomous mode and a fully autonomous mission) are also presented. During field deployments, the MiniFluo-glider package was able to detect concentration gradients from offshore marine waters toward the head of a Mediterranean harbor ( < 80 ng L-1) as well as hydrocarbon patches at the surface waters of an oil and gas exploitation field in the North Sea (< 200 ng L-1, mainly Naphthalene). It is suggested that using only the WAF calibration, the concentration derived with the MiniFluo agrees within one order of magnitude with the concentration determined by Gas Chromatography coupled with Mass Spectrometry (overestimation by a factor 7 on average). These performances can be improved if the calibration is made with a WAF with PAH proportions similar to the one find in the environment. Finally, it is shown that the use of in situ calibration on water samples collected during the glider deployment, when possible, gives the best results.",,,,,,,,,18,0,0,0,8,0,18,,,,2296-7745,,,,,,,,,,"Fisheries & Oceans Canada, Northwest Atlantic Fisheries Ctr, St John, NF, CanadaUniv Toulon & Var, Aix Marseille Univ, CNRS, IRD,MIO UM 110, Marseille, FranceALSEAMAR, Rousset, France",ALSEAMAR,,,2019-04-10,WOS:000462726400001,,

Korean government also has tried to demonstrate CCS technology in the Korean Peninsula, but there is no current legislation to regulate CCS related issues. One can say that the ‘Marine Environment Management Act’ is the law to regulate CCS, but it is not enough because it only has a provision to allow emitting CO2 stream into the ocean even though it defines CO2 stream as a ‘waste’.In that regard it is necessary to prepare legislation to regulate CCS related issues before implementing CCS projects, and generally there are two ways; amending all the related legislations including the ‘Marine Environment Management Act’ or enacting one single legislation on CCS. This paper reviews climate change policy and CCS technology of US, EU and Japan, and compares them with our current situation to suggest which way is more appropriate to be applied to Korea. The conclusion reached in this paper is the latter one among those two ways, enacting one single legislation on CCS because amendment of related legislations cannot ensure systemicity and coherence of the legal system.There are three government departments, the Ministry of Trade, Industry & Energy, the Ministry of Oceans and Fisheries and the Ministry of Environment which are promoting a single bill regarding CCS. Each of them, however, is working on it respectively for its own purpose, so it became the cause of wasting time and budget. Therefore, it is necessary to organize a committee which can encompass all the three departments to make a single legislation.Besides the single bill on CCS, all of those CCS related legislations needs to be amended reflecting changes, so this paper also suggests ways to improve the ‘Environmental Impact Assessment System’, for example reflecting the characteristics of CCS in particular, which can be considered when the CCS related legislations will be amended.",,,,"지구온난화의 영향으로 인한 해양환경에 대한 미국, EU, 일본, 한국의 기후변화대응 정책을 살펴보았다. 그리고 이산화탄소의 감축수단으로 인정받고 있는 이산화탄소의 포집 및 저장 기술(CCS)에 대한 미국, EU, 일본, 한국의 현황에 대해 고찰해 보았다.지구온난화를 방지하기 위한 기후변화대응 정책은 다양하게 시도되고 있다. 그 중의 하나의 방법은 이산화탄소를 포집하여 저장하는 기술(CCS)로 온실가스 저감정책으로 주목받고 있다. 이러한 이산화탄소 포집 및 저장기술을 시행하기 위하여 우리나라의 현행 관련 법제를 살펴보면, 특히 한국은 포집한 이산화탄소의 해양 지중저장을 위한 현행법은 「해양환경관리법」에서 포집된 이산화탄소를 해저지질구조내 고립격리방법에 의하여 배출할 수 있는 폐기물로 분류한 것 외에는 CCS를 염두해 놓고 제정된 법률이 없기 때문에 CCS를 규율하기에 적당한 법률이 없다.그렇다면 우리나라에서 CCS 사업을 하기 위해서는 그나마 관련이 있는 「해양환경관리법」과 관련된 모든 법률을 개정하는 방법과 하나의 단일법을 제정하는 방법이 있는데 어떤 방법을 택하는 것이 좋은지에 대하여 미국, EU, 일본, 한국의 기후변화정책과 관련 기술의 현황을 살펴보았고, 특히 우리나라의 관련 법률들을 검토하고 결론을 도출하였다. 그 결과 단일법을 제정하지 않고, 관련된 법률을 개정하여 규율하기에는 법률의 체계성이나 일관성에 한계가 있으므로 단일법을 마련할 것을 제안하였다.현재 CCS와 관련하여 단일법안을 추진하는 부서는 산업통상자원부, 해양수산부, 환경부이다. 현재 3부처는 각기 다른 목적을 갖고 입법을 추진하고 있는데 이는 시간과 예산낭비를 초래하고 있어 3부처를 아우를 수 있도록 합의체를 만들어 통합법을 만들어야 한다.이와 같이 CCS 통합법을 제정한다고 하더라도 개별 법률들의 개정이 필요하다. 관련 법률의 개정시 특히 CCS의 특성을 반영할 수 있도록 환경영향평가제도의 개선사항에 대해 고찰하였다.",,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,1226-251X,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2015-06-25,KJD:ART001992705,,
J,,,,,,,,,Thomas Spencer,,A hierarchical approach to the examination of the relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem service flows across coastal margins.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Awarded Grant,Jun 17 2012,2012,"CBESS Summary:The health of the UK's coastlines is inextricably linked to our success as an island nation, and resonate through our economy, our recreation, and our culture. Most pressingly, of all the UK's many and varied landscapes, its coastal systems are the ones most immediately sensitive to climate change. As temperatures increase, sea levels will rise and the forces experienced where land and sea meet will become more destructive. Salt marshes, mudflats, beaches and rocky shores will all be affected but, of these areas, the most sensitive are the mudflats and salt marshes that are common features of coastal systems, and which comprise just over half of the UK's total estuarine area. Not only do these landscapes support a wide range of economically valuable animal and plant species, they also act as sites of carbon storage, nutrient recycling, and pollutant capture and destruction. Their preservation is, therefore, of the utmost importance, requiring active and informed management to save them for future generations. The Natural Environment Research Council's call to help understand the landscape-scale links between the functions that these systems provide (ecosystem service flows) and the organisms that help provide these services (biodiversity stocks) offers an important opportunity to move beyond most previous work in this field, which has been conducted at small or laboratory scales. While of foundational scientific importance, the implications of laboratory studies can be hard to translate into policy, and coastal managers require a clearer evidence base to understand how ecosystem service flows operate at much larger spatial scales, e.g. entire salt marshes or regions of intertidal flat and salt marshes. The programme we are proposing 'A hierarchical approach to the examination of the relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem service flows across coastal margins' (CBESS) will provide such a large scale understanding. Our consortium of UK experts ranges from microbial ecologists, through environmental economists, to mathematical modellers, including organisations like the BTO and the RSPB, who have immediate and vested interest in the sustainable use of coastal wetlands.Together, CBESS will create a study that spans the landscape scale, investigating how biodiversity stocks provide the following ecosystem services (cf. National Ecosystem Assessment).- 'Supporting' services: nutrient cycling, healthy habitat -'Provisioning services; goods obtained from the lanscape- 'Regulating' services: coastal protection, climate regulation (greenhouse gas exchange, carbon sequestration)- Cultural services: Recreation (walking, canoeing, angling, birding, hunting and beauty)CBESS will combine the detailed study of two regional landscapes with a broad-scale UK-wide study to allow both specific and general conclusions to be drawn. The Regional study will compare two areas of great local and national importance: Morecambe Bay on the west coast and the Greater Essex coastline on the east coast. We will carry out biological and physical surveys at more than 600 stations and use these results to clarify how biodiversity can provide these important ecosystem functions. This information will be shared with those interested in using and managing coastal systems and, after our analysis; we will propose practical methods and improved tools for the future analysis, management, and sustainability of the UK's coastal wetlands.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,NE/J015423/1,,,,,,,,University of Cambridge,,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:15366527,,

Present study was undertaken to explore the extent of impact of the predicted sea level rise for the region on total organic carbon (TOC) pools of the mangrove ecosystems in Negombo estuary located on the west coast of Sri Lanka. Extents of the coastal inundations under minimum (0.09 m) and maximum (0.88 m) sea level rise scenarios of IPCC for 2100 and an intermediate level of 0.48 m were determined with GIS tools. Estimated total capacity of organic carbon retention by these mangrove areas was 499.45 Mg C ha(-1) of which 84% (418.98 Mg C ha(-1)) sequestered in the mangrove soil and 16% (80.56 Mg C ha(-1)) in the vegetation. Total extent of land area potentially affected by inundation under lowest sea level rise scenario was 218.9 ha, while it was 476.2 ha under intermediate rise and 696.0 ha with the predicted maximum sea level rise. Estimated rate of loss of carbon sink function due to inundation by the sea level rise of 0.09 m is 6.30 Mg C ha(-1) y(-1) while the intermediate sea level rise indicated a loss of 9.92 Mg C ha(-1) y(-1) and under maximum sea level rise scenario, this loss further increases up to 11.32 Mg C ha(-1) y(-1). Adaptation of mangrove plants to withstand inundation and landward migration along with escalated photosynthetic rates, augmented by changing rainfall patterns and availability of nutrients may contribute to reduce the rate of loss of carbon sink function of these mangrove ecosystems. Predictions over change in carbon sequestration function of mangroves in Negombo estuary reveals that it is not only affected by oceanographic and hydrological alterations associated with sea level rise but also by anthropogenic processes, therefore the impacts are site specific in terms of distribution and magnitude.",,,,,,,,,29,3,0,0,19,1,30,,,0921-8181,1872-6364,,,,,,,,,,"Open Univ Sri Lanka, Dept Bot, Nugegoda, Sri LankaUniv Kelaniya, Dept Bot, Kelaniya, Sri Lanka",,,,2018-02-27,WOS:000424854000013,,

Here, we quantified the Holocene floodplain sediment and organic carbon storage for four medium-sized rivers in Belgium, located in the European loess and sand belts. The results indicate that floodplains store large amounts of mineral sediment and soil organic carbon with most of the storage at greater depths below the surface. The observed regional variability in floodplain storage shows to be controlled by catchment characteristics and anthropogenic impact. The river basins which have known long-term anthropogenic impact do not only store on average 4.4 times more sediment, but also 2.6 times more organic carbon. Even more, the historic human impact trajectory has a profound impact on the sensitivity of the organic carbon stock to external factors in current times.

Energy systems models have been essential in identifying the importance of CCS but they neglect to impose constraints on the availability and use of geologic CO2 storage reservoirs. In this work we analyse reservoir performance sensitivities to varying CO2 storage demand for three sets of injection scenarios designed to encompass the UK's future low carbon energy market. We use the ECLIPSE reservoir simulator and a model of part of the Southern North Sea Bunter Sandstone saline aquifer. From a first set of injection scenarios we find that varying amplitude and frequency of injection on a multi-year basis has little effect on reservoir pressure response and plume migration. Injectivity varies with site location due to variations in depth and regional permeability. In a second set of injection scenarios, we show that with envisioned UK storage demand levels for a large coal fired power plant, it makes no difference to reservoir response whether all injection sites are deployed upfront or gradually as demand increases. Meanwhile, there may be an advantage to deploying infrastructure in deep sites first in order to meet higher demand later. However, deep-site deployment will incur higher upfront cost than shallow-site deployment. In a third set of injection scenarios, we show that starting injection at a high rate with ramping down, a low rate with ramping up or at a constant rate makes little difference to the overall injectivity of the reservoir. Therefore, such variability is not essential to represent CO2 storage in energy systems models resolving plume and pressure evolution over decadal timescales.",,,,,,,,,15,0,0,0,0,0,15,,,1750-5836,1878-0148,,,,,,,,,,"Imperial Coll London, Grantham Inst Climate Change & Environm, London SW7 2AZ, EnglandImperial Coll London, Ctr Environm Policy, London SW7 1NA, EnglandImperial Coll London, Ctr Proc Syst Engn, London SW7 2AZ, EnglandImperial Coll London, Dept Earth Sci & Engn, London SW7 2AZ, England",,,,2018-01-01,WOS:000425112100007,,

The mean richness values of taxons presented a maximum in April and May of 2002 (8 and 9 taxa, respectively). The mean Brillouin index of diversity presented the largest values in the same months (H = 1,6 to 1,8). The percentage of empty space was superior to 20% along the whole period. The dominant taxa (Balanus spp, Clytia spp, Obelia spp and Ostrea sp) alternated their cover percentage in different months following irregular patterns without defined time of recruitment.",,,,,,,,,6,0,0,0,6,2,7,,,0749-0208,1551-5036,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Estadual Norte Fluminense, Lab Ciencias Ambientais, BR-28013600 Campos Dos Goytacazes, Brazil",,,,2006-12-01,WOS:000202961400107,,

J,,,,,,,,,"Edmunds, Peter",,RAPID- The implications of El Nino-related bleaching on coral recruitment in Moorea,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Awarded Grant,Jan 15 2016,2016,"This research explores the effects of the 2015-16 El-Niño on coral reefs in French Polynesia where the US National Science Foundation supports a Long-Term Ecological Research site. El Niño brings a diversity of unusual conditions to the Pacific Ocean, but for coral reefs the most important effect is caused by seawater warming during the summer. Bleaching, the process causing corals to lose color and die, is a dramatic example of the negative effects of El Niño on reef corals, but high temperature also has insidious effects through impaired reproduction and poor recruitment of baby corals. As a result, El Niño conditions are likely to be associated with a degraded ability of coral reefs to regrow following disturbances, potentially preventing a full recovery, or favoring substantial changes in the community that develops. This research builds on the unrivalled history of LTER investigations in Moorea to ask how coral recruitment is affected by El Niño, as measured by the number of baby corals arriving to the reef, the number of baby corals that grow, and the kinds of communities that develop as a result of these events. The study involves fieldwork conducted in Moorea by faculty and graduate students, during which settlement tiles will be installed and monitored for baby corals, baby corals will be evaluated for overall health, and natural and artificial reef surfaces will be quantified for community development. The results of this study will help to understand how marine ecosystems are responding to the spectrum of natural and human-related disturbances to which they exposed, including global climate change, and will improve the capacity to understand in what form coral reefs in US waters and throughout the world will survive the coming century. The project creates unique opportunities for graduate students to work in an international context, where they will conduct research promoting STEM careers, an appreciation of diverse tropical ecosystems, and the role of climate change in modifying ecosystem dynamics. The broader implications of this project will be strengthened by integrating the results into life science curricula at local high schools, in part by utilizing settlement tiles from Moorea in classroom exercises staffed by California State University Northridge graduate students. This project addresses the effects of the 2015-16 El-Niño on coral recruitment in Moorea, French Polynesia, where coral reefs have been studied since 2005 thought the Moorea Coral Reef LTER. Time-series research supported by this program provides a unique historical context against which the ecological effects of the upcoming El-Niño can be gauged. As coral bleaching negatively affects coral reproduction, and previous El Niño events have been associated with globally-depressed coral recruitment, it is reasonably to hypothesize that coral recruitment in Moorea will change in magnitude (i.e., declining density) and type (i.e., taxonomic composition) over the next year. These possibilities have important implications, because coral recruitment mediates community resilience to disturbances, and modulates the trajectories of future reef development. In this 12-month project, a program of mensurative and manipulative experiments will be conducted to addressed four hypotheses: (1) coral recruitment will be depressed following El Niño-related seawater warming, (2) warming will affect post-settlement success of corals, (3) for Pocillopora, the effects on coral recruitment will be modulated through density-dependent processes, and (4) the resulting recruitment perturbations will modify trajectories of coral community development. The results of this research will have general application in revealing the demographic processes determining the response of coral reef communities to recurrent pulse disturbances such as El Niño events.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,1619893,,,,,,,,"The University Corporation, Northridge","The University Corporation, Northridge",,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:13869613,,

The potential negative impacts have stimulated a great deal of opposition to the first offshore wind power proposals in the U.S. and have delayed the development of the first offshore wind farm in the U.S. Here we discuss the costs and benefits of offshore wind relative to onshore wind power and conventional electricity production. We review cost estimates for offshore wind power and compare these to estimates for onshore wind and conventional power.

In this study, a method has been applied for assessing the effectiveness of ice management operations in terms of ability to modem the presence of pack ice around an offshore structure. This was accomplished in a real-time marine simulator environment as the venue for a systematic investigation. In the simulator, volunteer participants from a range of seafaring experience levels were tasked with individually completing ice management tasks. Recorded from 36 individuals' simulations was the extent to which the ice in a defined area was impacted, measured in terms of tenths ice concentration. These responses were then compared to two independent variables: 1) experience level of the participant, categorized as either cadet or seafarer, and 2) ice severity, measured in ice concentration. The results showed a significant difference in ice management effectiveness between experience categories, where effectiveness was defined as the average drop in ice concentration during simulation. Results also showed that the human factor of experience and the environmental factor of ice concentration both had significant effects on average concentration drop. The research provides insight into the relative importance of vessel operator skills in contributing to effective ice management, as well as how this relative importance changes as ice conditions vary from mild to severe.

This site was discovered and characterized in the early nineteen nineties, but has remained untouched until investigators from Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute(MBARI), Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary (MBNMS), National Ocean and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), and Stanford University mounted a joint expedition to re-investigate the Macon. The USS Macon location falls within the boundaries of the Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary, which was formed in the late nineties. One of the objectives of the Sanctuary is to characterize significant cultural heritage sites. The Macon is considered to be one of the most unique and significant wrecks on the west coast. The purpose of this expedition was to survey, document, and investigate surrounding areas to provide information to assist in determining the future disposition of the wreck site, and to develop a long range preservation strategy. Additionally, new robotic and vessel technology developed and used by the Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute was utilized in conducting this exploration. This paper will describe the background, research tools, and results of the first systematic and detailed survey of the Macon using the Remotely Operated Vehicle (ROV) Tiburon, in conjunction with the Research Vessel Western Flyer.The Macon wreckage area is made up of two primary debris fields that measure about 60 x 50 meters each, separated by approximately 120 meters. From previous underwater surveys, it was determined that the forward bow and mid section of the airship were positively indentifed on the seabed, however no definitive evidence of the aft tail section was ever seen. The most northern debris field includes the confirmed identification of the mooring mast receptacle, cabinets and furniture from the meteorologist or officers' cabin, condensers, and duraluminum girder structure. The second southern field is dominated by the airplane hanger area which still contains the remains of four Curtiss Sparrowhawk F9C-2 biplanes, five German built 12-cylinder Mayback airship engines, an Allison out-drive propeller mechanism, fuel tanks, and the galley/mess area. These debris areas are located in less than 500 meters of water, approximately four miles off the California coast.Planning for this project started in August 2004, with the research missions scoped in two phases scheduled for 2005 and 2006. Phase one was a two day side-scan survey effort conducted from the NOAA vessel McArthur II in the summer of 2005, using a USGS provided 455/100 KHz tow fish. This survey represented the most comprehensive and extensive inspection of the surrounding area. A primary goal of this mission was to search outside of the previously surveyed area for evidence of additional wreckage or the missing tail section of the Macon, which had eluded researchers since the early 1990s. This new survey revealed new secondary seabed anomalies for later investigation with the ROV. The sidescan operations resulted in covering approximately 10km by 5km of the seabed.The primary archaeological survey was performed over a five day period in September, 2006 from the MBARI Research Vessel Western Flyer. Primary goals for this expedition included 100 % video documentation of the debris fields while utilizing improved GIS mapping capabilities to accurately fix artifact positions and spatial relationships. A secondary goal for this visual survey was to generate a high-resolution mosaic of both debris fields using HDTV images stored on tape. Advanced controls software developed by Stanford University for MBARI ROVs was employed for this phase of the operation. This controls program primarily uses vision-based feedback, along with other sensors, to computer control the ROV in predetermined paths, which were used to generate overlapping video survey fines to produce a complete mosaic. Aspects of this new vision-based ROV controls program is summarized in this report.ROV Tiburon's primary camera systems are based on an a high definition video camera and high-resolution still camera. ROV Tiburon utilizes a four lamp coordinated lighting system based on Deep Sea Power and Light Hydrargyrum medium-arc iodide (HMI) ballast lighting system. The ROV was configured for two modes of operations, viewing and survey. The survey mode is a standard configuration of forward looking video and lighting, while the mosaic arrangement employs the cameras and lighting in a fixed downward looking position.A significant component of the Macon Exploration project was to provide for a variety of outreach and educational applications. Aspects of these outreach efforts were achieved using advanced microwave technology, and teacher and educators at sea. This report will summarize the results of the development and use of a low cost MBARI high bandwidth, short-range ship to shore microwave system, and exploiting a live underwater feed to the World Wide Web.All mission goals were accomplished for this project. Over six ROV dives were completed with approximately 50 hours of deep water survey, which were recorded on high definition and Beta tape formats. Researchers completed detailed geo-referenced maps and an inventory of Macon artifacts. Aircraft Bureau numbers were established through identification of aircraft coloring. Complete coverage of both wreckage fields using navigation grade video tile mosaics has been produced. The final imaging portion of this project has required development of improved processing techniques due to the vast amount of data that still needs to be managed in order to complete high resolution finished products. Researchers have determined that there is a significant degradation in the airship aluminum girder structure since the site was last visited 15 years ago, in addition to other changes to the site. There is also evidence of sediment transport with an accumulation of several centimeters in some areas based upon comparisons with previous expeditions.",,,,,2007 OCEANS Conference2007 OCEANS Conference,"SEP 29-OCT 04, 2007SEP 29-OCT 04, 2007",MTS; IEEE; Canada; Oceanworks; ISE Grp Co; Sun Star Elect L P; KONGSBERG; IMAGENEX TECHNOL CORP; ONR; OPSIMTS; IEEE; Canada; Oceanworks; ISE Grp Co; Sun Star Elect L P; KONGSBERG; IMAGENEX TECHNOL CORP; ONR; OPSI,"Vancouver, CANADAVancouver, CANADA",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,0197-7385,,978-0-933957-37-4,,,,,,,,,"Monterey Bay Aquarium Res Inst, Moss Landing, CA 95039 USA",,,,2007-01-01,WOS:000256526300007,,

Sometime between 1839 and 1858, a hurricane isolated its lagoon from the ocean, and the lagoon became a brackish ecosystem. In spite of its geographic isolation, human activities have deeply altered this insular ecosystem since the 1890s. Among disruptions induced by humans were introductions of alien species. The present paper aims to synthesize the knowledge of the terrestrial and freshwater vertebrate communities collected between 1825, the year of the first documented human landing, and 2004. This synthesis helps to understand the evolution of the populations of these communities and allows an estimate of how many introduced species are present. This survey is restricted to species that reproduce locally. Though no fish was recorded as spawning in the lagoon, breeding of 20 vertebrates (3 reptiles, 12 birds and 5 mammals) is assumed or recorded from the terrestrial part of Clipperton. A single record from 1825 mentioned the presence of 3 autochthonous species, a marine turtle and two pinnipeds, but these have not been reported since then. The 10 other autochthonous species are a skink, Emoia cyanura, and 9 seabirds. Among these seabirds are Sula dactylatra and S. leucogaster, which currently constitute a gigantic mixed breeding colony. Seven species have invaded Clipperton. Fulica americana and Gallinula chloropus are freshwater birds that colonized the lagoon after its isolation. The former was first recorded in 1901, the latter in 1986. The first record of the seabird, Sula sula, was in 1958. This species now breeds on the island owing to the introduction of coconut palms during the 1890s. Humans introduced the remaining four species inadvertently. These are a gecko, Gehyra mutilata, which was probably transported from Mexico before 1958; a mouse, Mus musculus, which was recorded just once in 1958 and is now absent; an ungulate, Sus scrofa, which was introduced in 1897 and eradicated in 1958; and a rat, Rattus rattus, which was probably introduced in 1998 or 1999. Shipwrecks are the probable cause of the arrival of at least the latter two species. Impacts on ecosystem function caused by the introduction and eradication of S. scrofa are discussed. Potential or demonstrated impacts of R. rattus are also discussed. The prompt eradication of the rat appears to be the most important step that must be taken to prevent irreversible consequences to this unique ecosystem. Two strategies are proposed for this eradication.",,,,,,,,,4,0,0,0,7,0,9,,,0249-7395,,,,,,,,,,,"INRA, SCRIBE, Equipe Gest Populat Invas, IFR 140, F-35000 Rennes, France",,,,2006-01-01,WOS:000239079500003,,

There is worldwide concern over increasing concentrations of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere and its influence on global climate. Managing atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide requires understanding how ecosystems process carbon, and identifying systems that potentially store carbon for long periods of time. Carbon dynamics of the ocean are critical to atmospheric carbon remediation, but recent work has suggested that storage of carbon in freshwater systems is also important to the global carbon cycle. Understanding the controls of carbon storage in lake and wetland sediments represents a potential regulatory mechanism for increasing atmospheric carbon removal through management practices. This project will assess the role of shallow lakes and wetlands in the global carbon cycle and determine if they can be managed to store carbon in sediments more efficiently. Shallow lakes are dominated by either submerged aquatic plants or algae, and this study will test the hypothesis that shallow lakes dominated by submerged plants store more carbon in sediments than do lakes dominated by algae. It is hypothesized that submerged plants facilitate higher carbon storage because they are more resistant to decomposition relative to algae. These hypotheses will be tested using both modern day measurements and records from lake sediment cores to estimate carbon storage rates over scales of decades to centuries. Modern-day measurements will involve both comparative and experimental approaches, including observations on lakes that are manipulated to shift from algae to submerged-plant dominance. Many shallow lakes and wetlands are already heavily managed, but not necessarily for carbon removal.

Tourism, industrialization, extensive fishing, oil processing and shipping are extensive sources of pollution in the Red Sea. We analyzed the geochemical characteristics and microbial community of sediments along the Egyptian coast of the Red Sea. Our sites mainly included 1) four ports used for shipping aluminum, ilmenite and phosphate; 2) a site previously reported to have suffered extensive oil spills; and 3) a site impacted by tourism. Two major datasets for the sediment of ten Red Sea coastal sites were generated; i) a chemical dataset included measurements of carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen and sulfur, metals and selected semi-volatile oil; and ii) a 16S rRNA Pyrotags bacterial metagenomic dataset. Based on the taxonomic assignments of the 16S rRNA Pyrotags to major bacterial groups, we report 30 taxa constituting an Egyptian Red Sea Coastal Microbiome. Bacteria that degrade hydrocarbons were predominant in the majority of the sites, particularly in two ports where they reached up to 76% of the total identified genera. In contrast, sulfate-reducing and sulfate-oxidizing bacteria dominated two lakes at the expense of other hydrocarbon metabolizers. Despite the reported Egyptian Red Sea Coastal Microbiome, sites with similar anthropogenic pollutants showed unique microbial community abundances. This suggests that the abundance of a specific bacterial community is an evolutionary mechanism induced in response to selected anthropogenic pollutants. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Africa hosts about 19% of the world's mangroves, yet relatively few studies have examined the carbon stocks of African mangroves. The available studies report considerable differences among sites and amongst the different pools of carbon stocks. None considered the effects of seaward distance. We present details of AGC and SOC carbon stocks for Lindi in Tanzania, and focus on how these values differ with increasing seaward distance and, how our results compare to those reported elsewhere across Africa. Results AGC ranged between 11 and 55 Mg C ha(-1), but was not significantly affected by seaward distance. SOC for 0-1 m depth ranged from 154 to 484, with a mean of 302 Mg C ha(-1). SOC was significantly negatively correlated with seaward distance. Mangrove type (estuarine/oceanic), soil erosion, soil depth may explain these differences We note important methodological differences in previous studies on carbon stocks in mangroves in Africa. Conclusion This study indicates that seaward distance has an important effect on SOC stocks in the Lindi region of Tanzania. SOC should be fully incorporated into national climate change mitigation policies. Studies should report seaward distance and to describe the type of mangrove stand to make results easily comparable across sites and to assess the true value of Blue Carbon in Africa. We recommend focusing on trees > 10 cm diameter for AGC, and sampling soils to at least 1 m depth for SOC, which would provide a more complete assessment of the potentially considerable mangrove carbon store.",,,,,,,,,9,0,0,0,6,0,11,,,1750-0680,,,,,,,,,,,"Univ York, York Inst Trop Ecosyst, Dept Environm & Geog, York YO10 5NG, N Yorkshire, EnglandColorado State Univ, Dept Ecosyst Sci & Sustainabil, Campus Delivery 1476, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USAMkwawa Univ, Fac Humanities & Social Sci, Dept Geog & Econ, Coll Educ, Iringa, TanzaniaSokoine Univ Agr, Coll Forestry Wildlife & Tourism, Dept Ecosyst & Conservat, Morogoro, TanzaniaUNEP WCMC, 219 Huntington Rd, Cambridge, EnglandUniv Copenhagen, GLOBE Inst, CMEC, Copenhagen, DenmarkSokoine Univ Agr, Natl Carbon Monitoring Ctr, Morogoro, TanzaniaUniv Ghent, Dept Environm, CAVElab Computat & Appl Vegetat Ecol, Ghent, Belgium",Mkwawa Univ,,,2020-12-29,WOS:000596949100001,33284405,

In the DP system, the thrust allocator is used to distribute the desired generalized forces computed by the motion controller among the thrusters. However, to ensure safe operation of the vessel despite the thruster failure, the vessel is equipped with redundant thruster configuration and, therefore, is overactuated. For overactuated vessels, the choice of a particular solution for thrust allocation is found using some kind of optimization process. In this paper, the thrust allocator tries to minimize the power consumption and takes forbidden/spoil zones into account. The formulated thrust allocation problem becomes nonconvex due to thrust direction constraints on azimuth thrusters. The conventional methods get trapped in local minima and fail to find the optimum solution for the formulated nonconvex thrust allocation problem. In this paper, an improved harmony search (IHS) algorithm for solving the nonconvex thrust allocation problem is proposed. IHS is a variant of the harmony search (HS) algorithm. The HS algorithm is a music-based meta-heuristic optimization method, which is analogous with the music improvisation process where a musician continues to polish the pitches to obtain better harmony. Obtained numerical results show that the IHS algorithm has better convergence property when compared to the HS algorithm and the genetic algorithm (GA). Moreover, the power consumption for thrust allocation using the IHS algorithm is lower when compared with HS, GA, and Mincon (sequential quadratic programming) algorithms. The percentage savings in total power consumption for thruster allocation as compared to the Mincon algorithm for GA, HS, and IHS methods are 44.96%, 48.39%, and 51.58%, respectively.",,,,,,,,,21,4,0,0,0,0,26,,,0364-9059,1558-1691,,,,,,,,,,"Natl Univ Singapore, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, Singapore 117576, SingaporeMalaviya Natl Inst Technol, Dept Elect Engn, Jaipur 302017, Rajasthan, India",,,,2014-11-28,WOS:000343903200012,,

The most straightforward method to determine the extreme design response under a specified design sea state, is to carry out N time domain simulations, so as to capture the inherent randomness of this sea state and use the N maximum values to estimate the most probable maximum response for design. However, this requires typically 30-40 time-domain analyses of the same design sea state, which is computationally extensive. In this paper it is shown that the required number of time domain simulations can be reduced significantly by utilising the peaks of the mooring tension time series, obtained from time domain simulations, to derive a distribution for the maxima. Different variations of using these peaks are explored and a best practice for this technique is proposed. In order to establish a robust benchmark for evaluating and validating this best practice, extensive time domain simulations have been carried out for a large permanently connected, weathervaning vessel, with catenary mooring system, in a tropical cyclone environment. Both extreme and survival conditions are explored, by running 170 3-h simulations for each condition, thereby representing in detail the random nature of each sea state. It is shown that a reliable distribution for the maxima, (within +/- 4% from the benchmark) can be obtained in a manner which is simple and computationally efficient, based on just 4-7 time domain analyses. Thus by using more peaks from the time domain analyses, there is a significant gain in terms of accuracy and efficiency. The above best practice is used to calculate the most probable maximum mooring line response and the variability of this maximum (short term variability) within a 3-h sea state for environmental conditions with annual exceedance probabilities of 10(-2) and 10(-4). It is shown that the short term variability is not invariant but may be described in terms of a Gumbel distribution whose parameters depend on the magnitude of the response. These expressions provide a means of calculating the long term distribution of mooring line load, accounting for the short term variability, which can be used to address the reliability of a mooring system.",,,,,,,,,31,2,0,0,1,0,33,,,0951-8339,1873-4170,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Western Australia, Ctr Offshore Fdn Syst, 35 Stirling Hwy, Crawley 6009, Australia",,,,2018-09-28,WOS:000444927700021,,

The OIM is responsible for the safety and well-being of all persons onboard and within 500 m of the installation. Should an emergency situation arise, the OIM performs one of the most critical roles in emergency response - management of the response to the emergency to mitigate and make safe the installation to secure a place of safety for persons onboard or organise their safe evacuation. Such emergency response shall also include limiting the loss of hydrocarbons to the environment. The CRO monitors and interprets the output from an installation's Distributed Control System (DCS) and Fire and Gas Panel (FGP), responding to alarms and deviations from steady state. In many instances, an offshore CRO's actions in response to these deviations can determine whether or not the situation deteriorates into a disaster. Should an emergency occur, the CRO will act in accordance with an installation's emergency response procedures and OIM instructions.The persistence of incidents, a number leading to disasters, in the industry highlights the importance of both OIM and CRO competence in controlling emergencies. Both positions require an effective system to assess the competence of job holders. Research at the University of Aberdeen identified potential barriers that can prevent the effective competence assessment of an OIM in emergency response. An extension to this research analyses the two offshore industry standards for competence in emergency response: OPITO 7025 - OIM Controlling Emergencies and OPITO 9004 - Control Room Operator Emergency Response, and associated documentation, applying a critical hermeneutic approach, focusing on the assessment of underpinning knowledge and understanding within the roles. The key findings are that there currently exists no effective means to assess the underpinning technical knowledge and understanding of either OIMs or CROs in emergency response within the offshore industry. Knowledge and, in particular, understanding are poorly defined within the relevant OPITO standards. There exists no validation of evidence collated to support an individual's underpinning knowledge and understanding and no truly independent audit of collated evidence or the process of assessment.The research is important to Duty Holders (see also OSD Installation Operators under UK Offshore Safety Directive Regulations) and employers within the offshore oil and gas industry, organisations associated with the offshore industry, safety engineers and UK Government departments with regard to the effectiveness of competence assessment of appointed OIMs and CROs.

In 2019, SMRU Consulting were commissioned by Marine Scotland to update the recommended demographic parameters for modelling and to carry out a sensitivity analysis of the outputs to misspecification of population demographic parameters, to ensure that current model outputs were appropriate and that users understand the potential implications of uncertainty in baseline demographic parameters. The review of demographic parameters involved a desk-based literature review of information that has become available since the previous report was published on the trajectory, size and demographic parameters of the cetacean management units (MUs) and seal management areas (MAs) for the five species of marine mammals most relevant to Scottish waters (grey and harbour seals, harbour porpoise, bottlenose dolphins and minke whales). Several key species experts were consulted in the process of the review. The evaluation of the sensitivity of outputs to misspecification of demographic parameters focused on the ratio output metric of the counterfactual of population size (the median of the ratio of the impacted to un-impacted population size across all simulated matched replicate pairs). This was felt to be more appropriate than the ratio of the impacted to un-impacted growth rates due to the nature of the impact on marine mammals, with disturbance during discrete periods of construction activity rather than a continuous level of impact over an extended period. Two approaches were used in the sensitivity testing: The effect of changing the value of a single parameter independently of the others (this was done for all species except grey seal) and the effect of adjusting all the demographic parameters systematically to compare scenarios with the same population trajectory but different combinations of demographic parameters. Section Four summarises the results of the review of demographic parameters and presents updates where new information has been published since the last review (Harwood and King, 2017). New information has been published on all species to inform our understanding of population trajectories, but not all populations had updated demographic information available. One major difference from the previous review is that recommended values have now been provided for English harbour seal management areas where they were absent before. Section Five presents the results of the sensitivity analysis. The observed sensitivity to misspecification is complex. It depends both on the proportion of the population that experiences disturbance above the threshold that experts judged is required to affect vital rates, and the magnitude of the effect on the vital rate, as well as on the effect of the parameters on the starting stable age structure of the population. The analyses demonstrate substantial variation in sensitivity to parameter misspecification among species and demographic variables. The greatest sensitivity was to variation in the value of pup survival for harbour seals and, overall, changes in pup/calf survival had the greatest impact on the counterfactual of population size. This pattern results from the fact that pup/calf survival is the demographic variable that experts considered to be most sensitive to the effects of disturbance. As a result, most of the simulations predicted some effect of the operation being modelled on pup/calf survival, whereas effects of fertility were rare. In addition, the effect of the additional mortality associated with disturbance depends on the absolute value of the demographic rate that is affected. The widest range of pup survival values was used in the analysis of harbour seal population dynamics, which is why these simulations show the greatest effect. Sensitivity to misspecification in other demographic variables is largely a consequence of the effect of changing the value of a particular variable on the stable age structure used to initiate the iPCoD simulations - for example a population with a high adult survival rate will contain a larger proportion of adults and will therefore be more resilient and recover faster after disturbance. However, despite this complexity and variability, overall, the sensitivity to parameter misspecification is smaller than the variability among simulations, which results from the variability in expert's opinions on the degree to which vital rates are affected and the various forms of stochasticity (environmental and demographic) that contribute to the simulations. In addition, the sensitivity is only apparent at relatively high (and somewhat unrealistic) levels of impact, and therefore we conclude that the metric of counterfactual of population size is robust to misspecification in demographic rates. The final section of the report provides a table of recommended parameter values for modelling the impact of disturbance from offshore wind farm construction on UK marine mammal populations using iPCoD. Ultimately, it is the responsibility of the iPCoD user to justify the selection of demographic parameters, and new information may continue to become available from ongoing monitoring and modelling of these populations that may justify a different selection. We recommend that the choices for parameters are discussed and agreed with consultees before assessments are undertaken and we hope that the information presented in this report will guide these discussions. However, in the absence of estimates of demographic parameters, we highlight that, in general, adoption of a higher pup/calf survival rate and a lower adult survival and fertility rate will ensure the most precautionary predictive modelling outcomes.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,2043-7722,,,,,,,,,,,"Univ St Andrews, SMRU Consulting, St Andrews, Fife, KY16 8LB, United Kingdom",,,,2021-07-31,ZOOREC:ZOOR15708052450,,

Different types of inspection tasks (visual and acoustic inspection, gas measuring) have been programmed to and executed by the robot successfully without ever jeopardizing the safety of the platform or the platform personnel.The application of mobile robotics in offshore environments can reduce the level of manual human intervention required to operate a production facility thereby increasing the efficiency of the workforce, improving safety and working conditions, and improving the production economics. The successful evaluation of the first realization of a mobile inspection and manipulation robot has thus leveled the ground for future mobile robot installations in offshore environments.",,,,,IEEE RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and SystemsIEEE RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems,"OCT 10-15, 2009OCT 10-15, 2009","IEEE Robot & Automat Soc; Robot Soc Japan; Soc Instrument & Control Engn; IEEE Ind Elect Soc; Inst Control, Robot & Syst Korea; ABB; Barrett Technol, Inc; Willow Garage; ROBOTIS; Aldebaran RobotIEEE Robot & Automat Soc; Robot Soc Japan; Soc Instrument & Control Engn; IEEE Ind Elect Soc; Inst Control, Robot & Syst Korea; ABB; Barrett Technol, Inc; Willow Garage; ROBOTIS; Aldebaran Robot","St. Louis, MOSt. Louis, MO",33,0,0,0,1,0,34,,,,,978-1-4244-3803-7,,,,,,,,,"Fraunhofer IPA, D-70569 Stuttgart, Germany",Fraunhofer IPA,,,2009-01-01,WOS:000285372901227,,

An automatic detection algorithm was used to identify airgun sound patterns, and fin whale calling levels were summarized via long-term spectral analysis. Both airgun and fin whale sounds were recorded at all sites. Fin whale calling rates were higher at sites north of 32 degrees N, increased during the late summer and fall months at all sites, and peaked during the winter months, a time when airgun noise was often prevalent. Seismic survey vessels were acoustically located off the coasts of three major areas: Newfoundland, northeast Brazil, and Senegal and Mauritania in West Africa. In some cases, airgun sounds were recorded almost 4000 km from the survey vessel in areas that are likely occupied by fin whales, and at some locations airgun sounds were recorded more than 80% days/month for more than 12 consecutive months.

This part of the design needs to be based on best available measurement technologies and deployment methods, minimizing the investments.

In this work, a site assessment procedures for emplacement of TEC machines are shown, comparing sites with different hydrogeological characteristics using the same design approach. In order to define the best conditions for siting, three case studies have been carried out, two for sea and last for river installation. The strait of Messina (Italy), a marine channel with an amphidromic point for the tides, has its minimum depth at 72 m, between Ganzirri and Punta Pezzo, deepening to 1000 m to the North East and down to 2000 m to the South. The Cook Inlet (Alaska), a large subarctic estuary in South-central Alaska which extends about 250 km from Anchorage bay to the Pacific Ocean. Tidally dominated currents control the hydrographic regime, meanwhile water levels and currents are influenced by tides coming from the Gulf of Alaska, which are significantly amplified as approaching Anchorage bay. The Pearl River Estuary and its adjacent coastal waters (China) have a length of about 70 km, a width of about 15 km and an average depth of about 4.8 m, but it has a depth of more than 20 m in its eastern part.

Enhanced oil recovery (EOR) is employed to increase production, as a part of EOR the Water Flooding Technology (WFT) is employed. The quality requirements for WFT and the increasing environmental concerns for produced water discharge lead to increased interest in zero-pollutant discharge. Traditional Produced Water Treatment (PWT) technologies(such as hydrocyclones) are already struggling to their fundamental limit, therefore the membrane filtration technology turns to be a potential candidate for zero-pollutant discharge. Membrane filtration technology suffers from the notorious fouling problem, where many methods for fouling prevention and removal are explored, the general idea is to guarantee that a relatively high permeability can be kept during filtration. Another crucial issue using membrane filtration technology is its huge energy consumption, for which there is little research has been done so far to systematically investigate and optimize the filtration system's energy efficiency, some smart filtration technology could contribute to handle this issue.",,,,,MTS/IEEE Oceans ConferenceMTS/IEEE Oceans Conference,"SEP 19-23, 2016SEP 19-23, 2016",MTS; IEEEMTS; IEEE,"Monterey, CAMonterey, CA",5,0,0,0,0,0,5,,,,,978-1-5090-1537-5,,,,,,,,,"Aalborg Univ, Dept Energy Technol, Esbjerg Campus Niels Bohrs Vej 8, DK-6700 Esbjerg, Denmark",,,,2016-01-01,WOS:000399929002120,,

The Sleipner area in the Southern Viking Graben hosts the first and longest operating industrial scale CO2 storage project, where CO2 is injected in a saline aquifer of the Utsira Formation. Time-lapse seismic monitoring shows neither that CO2 has left the Utsira Formation nor indications for fracturing of the caprock by the CO2 injection activity, which is in agreement with previous numerical simulations. However, large chimney structures as close as 7 km from the injection point indicate that the caprock has been breached in the geological past, which may raise questions about the integrity of the caprock above the Sleipner CO2 storage site. Here, we present seismically constrained numerical fluid flow simulations that evaluate the influence of chimney structures on the long-term performance of the CO2 storage operation at Sleipner. The simulation could reproduce the spreading of the Sleipner CO2 plume, which is controlled by the anisotropic permeability field of the Utsira Formation and the regional dip of the formation top. We have performed long-term plume evolution simulations, which show that the injected CO2 will not reach the existing chimney structures assuming a realistic injection duration of 30 years. Our simulations indicate that an unrealistically long injection period between 92 and 140 years would be required for the CO2 to reach the existing chimney structures. In this case, a comparably low chimney permeability of 10 mD may be sufficient to facilitate CO2 migration from the storage formation to the seafloor, once the CO2 has reached a chimney structure. However, the simulations indicate that it is very unlikely that the CO2 may migrate along existing chimney structures at Sleipner. Our results highlight that the reconstruction of palaeo fluid flow systems and the identification of focused fluid conduits should be considered in the assessment of CO2 storage sites.

It planned to capture 1 Mtpa from the Peterhead CCGT power station on the north east coast of Scotland and store the CO2 offshore, reusing existing infrastructure from the depleted Goldeneye gas field. The project was very advanced when cancelled and had submitted the Storage Permit Application to the UK regulatory authorities who had sent it on to the European Commission for their review.The development of the permit was facilitated by a collaborative approach to working alongside the UK Regulator. An additional verification step was included in the form of an Independent External Review from the British Geological Survey (BUS) and Herriot Watt University (HWLI).The EU commission provided an opinion that the permit fulfilled the requirements of the CCS directive, as long as two changes were made to the Environmental Statement and the period over which financial security was calculated. This positive result indicated that the final application was aood, however, the project team feels that they could have been more effective in some areas of its development. Two areas of improvement were: the process of developing the financial security provision, which took longer than expected; and being more effective in working with multiple regulator teams in order to address the integrated containment assessment and monitoring plans required for CO2 storage under the UK regulations and the EU directive.All in all the process of developing a Storage Permit Application under the UK transposition of the EU directive was found to be moderately straight forward and the close collaboration with the regulator added significant value. If the project team were to start again knowing what they know now it would have been possible to focus the technical work earlier on the requirements of Storage Permit award conditions. It is hoped that by sharing the Goldeneye experience that other projects can soon follow suit. (C) 2017 The Authors.

Both the reduction in tidal flats and the artificially simplified coastal line have distorted the spatio-temporal tidal hydrodynamics; to quantify this, we analyzed and evaluated tidal asymmetry by phase differences of the principal semi-diurnal lunar constituent My and its first over-tide M-4. Moreover, we applied the ADCIRC model to quantitatively investigate near- and far-field impacts on tidal variations using the gamma parameter, tidal energy flux, and dissipation rate. Through this study, we found that the tidal regime around the Incheon harbor area in Gyeonggi Bay has changed from ebb- to flood-dominant due to multiple nearby reclamations, in particular to the construction of the Siwha dike. The Saemangeum dike caused near-field de-amplification of M-2 but far-field amplification in the Shandong area of China. In addition to allowing a traditional asymmetry approach using phase difference, analyses based on the gamma parameter and tidal energy variations could distinctly improve spatial understanding of anthropogenic impacts on coastal tidal hydrodynamics.

It was first described in the 1930s by Brazilian dermatologist Jorge Lobo and is known to cause cutaneous and subcutaneous localised and widespread infections in humans and dolphins. Soil and vegetation are believed to be the chief habitat of the fungus, however, increasing reports in marine mammals has shifted the attention to the aquatic environment. Infection in humans has also been associated with proximity to water, raising the hypothesis that L. loboi may be a hydrophilic microorganism that penetrates the skin by trauma. Although its occurrence was once thought to be restricted to New World tropical countries, its recent description in African patients has wrecked this belief.

To determine the impact of the DWH oil spill, Gulf menhaden (Brevoortia patronus), a commercially harvested and significant trophic grazing species, was sampled from two Louisiana coastal regions between the years 2011-2013. Tissue extraction and GC/MS analysis demonstrated measurable concentrations of PAH within menhaden. Analysis yielded total PAHs, carcinogenic equivalents (BaP-TEQ), and mutagenic equivalents (BaP-MEQ) which provided an initial toxic potential assessment of this GoM Fishery. Gulf menhaden contained less total PAH concentrations in 2012 and significantly less in 2013 as compared to 2011 (p < 0.05) ranging from 7 ug/g tissue dry weight to 3 ng/g tissue dry weight. Carcinogenic and mutagenic PAHs were also significantly reduced (p < 0.05) over the three year period. The reduction of total PAH concentrations and the reduction of BaP-TEQs and MEQs between 2011 and 2013 indicates a diminished input of new source PAHs along with a reduction of carcinogenic and mutagenic PAHs in menhaden populations. The use of Gulf menhaden was successful in determining the acute toxic potential of PAHs contaminating the GoM in the years directly following the DWH spill event. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

The study shows a clear benefit at early ages due to synergic effects combining one or two types of nanosilica and metakaolin in the same matrix design, contributing physically by refining the final porous structure and chemically by increasing the chloride binding ability of the cementitious matrix design. It is estimated that the designed service live is of the order of 3 and 4 times greater for the blends exposes to chlorides at early ages (4 and 7 days) than for the reference cement exposed at 28 days.

The complexities of current modeling present significant challenges for deep sea oil exploitation. The multiyear return period extreme current model is one of the key factors for the reliable design of marine structures. Recently, due to limitations of design specifications and guidelines, improved methods to predict extreme values for the South China Sea based on prototype monitoring are required. In contrast to the traditional extreme value analytical method, the newly developed Average Conditional Exceedance Rate (ACER) method is robust and shows good accuracy for estimations of ocean environmental loading. The method offers good reliability for short-term prototype monitoring data. This study performs multiyear return period extreme value prediction of the current profile based on prototype monitoring data collected in the Liuhua (LH11-1) oil field that was recorded by an in-situ monitoring system. The 1-year and 10-year return period current velocity design indexes were obtained using the ACER method. The present current velocity profiles of multi-year return periods were compared with two design current load indexes of two floating platforms in Liuhua area. The consistency with comparison to TLP platform design indexes shows that the ACER method provides the accuracy and flexibility of the results needed in the construction of current load models in the South China Sea.

The existing experience shows that the tools developed for the offshore oil and gas industry, with the inherent risk criteria can be a powerful tool for choosing the best overall SHE-based project.

However the abandonment of an offshore installation does have many significant SHE issues.

Treatment of oiled sea turtles was guided by expected physiological and pathological effects of crude oil exposure extrapolated from studies in other species and from a single loggerhead sea turtle (Caretta caretta) study. While invaluable starting points, inherent limitations to extrapolation, and small sample size of the experimental exposure study, reduce their utility for clinical guidance and for assessing oil spill impacts. Effects of dispersants were not included in the previous experimental exposure study, and cannot be effectively isolated in the analysis of field data from actual spills. A terminal study of pivotal temperature of sex determination using eggs salvaged from doomed loggerhead nests provided an opportunity for an ancillary exposure study to investigate the acute effects of crude oil, dispersant, and a crude oil/dispersant combination in sea turtle hatchlings. Eggs were incubated at 27.2-30.8 degrees C, and hatchlings were randomly assigned to control, oil, dispersant, and combined oil/dispersant exposures for 1 or 4 days. Contaminant exposures were started after a 3 day post-hatching period simulating nest emergence. Turtles were placed in individual glass bowls containing aged seawater and exposed to oil (Gulf Coast-Mixed Crude Oil Sweet, CAS #8002-05-9, 0.833 mL/L) and/or dispersant (Corexit 9500A, 0.083 mL/L), replicating concentrations encountered during oil spills and subsequent response. Statistically significant differences between treatments and non-exposed controls were detected for PCV, AST, uric acid, glucose, calcium, phosphorus, total protein, albumin, globulin, potassium, and sodium. The principal dyscrasias reflected acute osmolar, electrolyte and hydration challenges that were more numerous and greater in combined oil/dispersant exposures at 4 days. Clinicopathological findings were supported by a failure to gain weight (associated with normal hatchling hydration in seawater) in dispersant and combination exposed hatchlings. These findings can help guide clinical response for sea turtles exposed to crude oil and crude oil/dispersant combinations, and indicate potential impacts on wildlife to consider when deploying dispersants in an oil spill response.",,,,,,,,,10,0,0,0,8,0,10,,,2297-1769,,,,,,,,,,,"North Carolina State Univ, Coll Vet Med, Dept Clin Sci, Morehead City, NC 28557 USANorth Carolina State Univ, Coll Vet Med, Ctr Marine Sci & Technol, Morehead City, NC 28557 USANorth Carolina State Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Morehead City, NC USANorth Carolina State Univ, Ctr Marine Sci & Technol, Morehead City, NC USANorth Carolina Wildlife Resources Commiss, Beaufort, NC USADuke Univ, Marine Lab, Nicholas Sch Environm, Beaufort, NC 28516 USATexas Tech Univ, Inst Environm & Human Hlth, Lubbock, TX 79409 USATTU Hlth Sci Ctr, Lubbock, TX USANorth Carolina Aquariums, Ctr Marine Sci & Technol, Morehead City, NC USA",North Carolina Wildlife Resources CommissTTU Hlth Sci CtrNorth Carolina Aquariums,,,2019-10-15,WOS:000497497600002,31681804,

Psychosocial risk auditing is a proactive method for monitoring the status of psychosocial factors influencing the risk of stress and ill-health in the oil and gas industry. It is a systematic and independent assessment of the status of psychosocial factors and barriers, it reveals non-compliance with requirements and best practice within different relevant levels of the organization, and is suitable as a basis for the development of risk reduction measures. The method comprises performance standards that are linked to the company's internal organizational requirements related to the psychosocial work environment. A range of different methods and data are used to assess and grade compliance with these standards. The aim of the auditing is to provide transfer of experience between units and the development of best practice while supporting organizational learning in offshore (and onshore) environments.

A high-performance low-density cement slurry system must be used for cementing to ensure the safety of subsequent drilling and mining on-site and to reduce the cost of cement slurry for the efficient development of oil and gas fields. Based on these problems, according to the principle of particle gradation, a mixture with a high accumulation rate and low density composed of five types of mineral materials, i.e., artificial microbeads, floating beads, microsilicon, fly ash, and slag, has been developed through a large number of indoor experiments, and a set of low-cost and low-density cement slurry systems has been developed; these systems are suitable for the shallow loose formations of offshore oil fields. The cement slurry system meets the requirements of the cementing operation conducted under different temperatures and pressures. The density range is 1.4-1.7 g/cm(3), which can be adjusted. The cement slurry is stable and exhibits good fluidity. The thickening time meets the requirements of cementing construction. Moreover, the compressive strength of the cement paste is high, and the compressive strength of cement paste is greater than 12 MPa for 24 h and 14 MPa for 48 h of curing at 50 degrees C, which maximizes the economic benefits.

There are several energy sources (i.e. pressure, chemical substances, electrical and mechanical instrumentation, telecom equipment, navigation radar system, gravity, heat/cold, biological substances, etc), which need to be maintained and/or deactivated until the platform is decommissioned. This manuscript first maps the current state of the art in relation to the maintenance of OP&PSs before decommissioning. Then, the Maintenance Regime Minimum' (MRM) approach is proposed to perform comparative analysis in order to identify and select the optimal maintenance hours within the decommissioning strategy, based on cost (e.g. man hours required), safety, and environmental challenges.

The lower extracellular pH of B. lyrifera may indicate a higher metabolism than epifaunal urchins and this could explain the heightened sensitivity of this species to elevated CO2. Thus, the results of this present study do not support our original hypothesis. Instead we suggest an alternative hypothesis that as infaunal organisms are exposed naturally to high levels of CO2, they may already be closer to the limits of their physiological performance. Thus any further CO2 increase could compromise their function. As a result of this sensitivity, infaunal urchins may be more at risk from an accidental release of CO2 from geological sub-seabed storage sites, or from the deliberate injection of CO2 into deep water masses, than their epifaunal counterparts.

Accurate information on sea ice thickness and topography data is required for basic ice-covered ocean studies and, increasingly, for addressing important navigation-, offshore structure design/safety- and climate change-issues. Since the early 1990's, upward-looking sonar (ULS) instrumentation have been developed and applied to provide under-ice topography data with high horizontal and vertical spatial resolution. Such internal recording ULS instruments, or ice profilers, are typically operated from the seafloor on taut fine mooring systems.The ASL Model IPS4 Ice Profiler, which has been widely used in studies of the Arctic Ocean, as well as in numerous seasonal ice zones and in the Southern Ocean, is being upgraded to allow much expanded data storage capacity (from 69 Mbytes to 1-8 Gigabytes) and 16 bit AID resolution for ice ranges and other parameters. With typical ping rates of 0.5 or 1 Hz, the enhanced capability of the Ice Profiler provides very high resolution measurements of ice keel drafts and the under-ice topography of sea-ice keel features. The Ice Profiler is often used in conjunction with an Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler which provides direct measurements of ice velocity. The combination of high resolution ice draft time series with ice velocities allows for computation of quasi-spatial ice drafts as a function of horizontal distance.The results from the first deployment of an upgraded Ice Profiler, operated just off the Confederation Bridge in Northumberland Strait, from November 2006 to April 2007, are presented and compared with the results of previous sea ice studies at the same location. The much larger onboard data capacity allows for realization of multiple targets for each ping and, on a subsampled basis, offers data on acoustic backscatter returns over the complete water column. This additional information is being analyzed to examine the nature and cause of occasional false target returns. In past measurement campaigns, there have been episodic occurrences of deep targets detected which are not consistent with sea ice features that can be reasonably expected to occur in Northumberland Strait. These features are often associated with occurrences of the largest (spring) tidal currents, leading to the hypothesis that these anomalous targets may be associated with velocity shears in the water column resulting from strong tidal flows past the bridge support structures. Based on these analyses, improvements to the target detection algorithm are being developed and tested.",,,,,2007 OCEANS Conference2007 OCEANS Conference,"SEP 29-OCT 04, 2007SEP 29-OCT 04, 2007",MTS; IEEE; Canada; Oceanworks; ISE Grp Co; Sun Star Elect L P; KONGSBERG; IMAGENEX TECHNOL CORP; ONR; OPSIMTS; IEEE; Canada; Oceanworks; ISE Grp Co; Sun Star Elect L P; KONGSBERG; IMAGENEX TECHNOL CORP; ONR; OPSI,"Vancouver, CANADAVancouver, CANADA",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,0197-7385,,978-0-933957-37-4,,,,,,,,,"ASL Environm Sci Inc, 1986 Mills Rd, Sidney, BC V8L 5Y3, CanadaPubl Works & Govt Serv Canada, Gatineau, PQ K1A 0S5, Canada",ASL Environm Sci IncPubl Works & Govt Serv Canada,,,2007-01-01,WOS:000256526300079,,

Tidal energy has been harnessed in various ways over the last few centuries, for both mechanical and electrical power generation. Presently, tidal energy is quickly becoming a viable alternative to conventional fossil fuel electrical generation, especially in the upper latitudes such as Europe and areas of North America. These sites tend to be close to shore, in relatively shallow water, and benefit from at least one period of reduced flow, or slack tide, during which certain installation and maintenance activities may occur.Open ocean marine hydrokinetic (MHK) power generation, however, poses many more challenges, while retaining the issues that tidal systems must overcome. Ideal MHK sites, typically within western boundary currents such as the Gulf Stream, Kuroshio, and Agulhas Currents, are tens of kilometers offshore, in hundreds if not thousands of meters of water. The ocean currents are relentless, flowing continuously and without significant velocity changes over periods of weeks to months. The hydrodynamic drag on generators, cables, and support equipment can be tremendous. Once moored in the currents, access to the generators for inspection, maintenance, and replacement is extremely challenging, and in some cases nearly impossible.Ocean Current Energy LLC (OCE) has developed equipment and procedures to address and overcome some of these difficulties. OCE has designed a novel device which utilizes generator coins which may be installed and removed while in the high current, similar to an aerial refueling operation. The OCE approach to these challenges demonstrate the required out of the box tactics of ocean engineering problem solving, while leveraging off the experience gained from similarities in tidal power generation.",,,,,Conference on OCEANSConference on OCEANS,"SEP 18-21, 2017SEP 18-21, 2017",,"Anchorage, AKAnchorage, AK",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,0197-7385,,*****************,,,,,,,,,"Ocean Current Energy LLC, Aventura, FL 33180 USA",Ocean Current Energy LLC,,,2017-01-01,WOS:000455012000300,,

Preconditioning of the seafloor for failure results from high sedimentation rates coupled with slope over-steepening, under-consolidation and abundant biogenic gas production. Catastrophic failure of production platforms and pipelines due to seafloor displacement during infrequent large hurricanes such as Camille in 1969 and Ivan in 2004, point to cyclical loading of the seafloor by waves as a primary movement trigger. Due to data limitations, the role of smaller storms and background oceanographic processes in driving seafloor movement has remained largely unconstrained but these are thought to contribute to significant seafloor change. With the aid of new high-resolution multibeam mapping and seismic reflection profiling across sections of the MRDF, several moving features within the deforming delta-front environment are investigated and potential hazards to infrastructure installed and adjacent to the region are discussed. Via repeat mapping surveys of selected areas and records of changing shipwreck locations, we highlight significant seafloor displacement across annual to decadal timescales. For example, individual blocks mapped within mudflow gullies adjacent to Southwest Pass show downslope transport of more than 80 m in a single year, while the SS Virginia, a 153 m-long oil tanker sunk in 1942, has been relocated and found to have moved downslope more than 400 m in 14 years, without a major hurricane (>Category 2) passing through the region.",,,,,,,,,13,1,0,0,0,0,13,,,0305-8719,,*****************,,,,,,,,,"US Geol Survey, Woods Hole, MA 02543 USALouisiana State Univ, Dept Geol & Geophys, Baton Rouge, LA 70803 USABur Ocean Energy Management, New Orleans, LA USASan Diego State Univ, Dept Geol Sci, San Diego, CA 92182 USAUS Naval Res Lab, Stennis Space Ctr, MS USALouisiana State Univ, Dept Oceanog & Coastal Sci, Baton Rouge, LA 70803 USALouisiana State Univ, Inst Coastal Studies, Baton Rouge, LA 70803 USA",Bur Ocean Energy ManagementUS Naval Res Lab,,,2020-09-18,WOS:000566145300035,,

Such a function has been often carried out by breakwaters which dissipate part of the incident wave energy.Recently, the ongoing climate changes and their related issues have moved the attention toward new kinds of coastal structures which can protect the land and human activities and at the same time harvest part of the available wave energy. Such an energy source is alternative to non renewable ones like oil and gas, it is covered by the incentives of the renewable energy sector and it is subjected to an increasing interest of the international community.In such a framework, the present challenge of the coastal engineering is to design hybrid Wave Energy Coverters (WECs) which are: (i) effective in protecting the land, (ii) efficient in extracting wave energy, (iii) economically competitive with the conventional structures, (iv) structurally reliable.In comparison to other WECs, the Oscillating Water Column (OWC) breakwaters are considered among the most promising, therefore it is needed to investigate their design characteristics appropriately. Indeed, the durability of hybrid OWC breakwaters is strongly related to their response to wave action. In particular, the most critical point is the front lip, which is subjected to external wave impact and internal pressures within the chamber, at the same time.The complexity of wave-OWC interactions is studied here by means of a large scale physical model, which has been tested under regular wave conditions. The Power Take Off (PTO) characteristics are replaced here by a circular orifice, whose section has been varied. Such variations of the orifice section cause different types of response of the air inside the pneumatic chamber to external wave forcing.The response of the device under regular waves has been monitored by means of wave gauges and pressure sensors located both at the OWC and along the flume. First, the time evolution of the air pressure signal is analyzed. This is strongly affected by the air compressibility which is the key parameter in this analysis, since it controls the air-water interaction and it influences the whole OWC dynamics.The spectral analyses of the signals of pressure and free surface elevation provide insights on the relationship between water column oscillations and pressures inside and outside the chamber, in terms of both amplitudes and phase lags. It is found that the relation between inner and outer pressures is shown to be related to the resonance coefficient, which is a function of the lag between the flow across the OWC and the forcing outer pressure.",,,,,,,,,24,0,0,0,0,0,24,,,0378-3839,1872-7379,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Catania, Dept Civil Engn & Architecture, Via S Sofia 64, I-95123 Catania, CT, ItalyPort Syst Author Western Sicilian Sea, Via Piano Ucciardone 4, I-90139 Palermo, PA, ItalyUniv Campania Luigi Vanvitelli, Dept Engn, Via Roma 9, I-81031 Aversa, CE, ItalyCNR, INM, Inst Marine Engn, Via Vallerano 139, I-00128 Rome, Italy",Port Syst Author Western Sicilian Sea,,,2019-10-09,WOS:000487172700029,,

The main objective of this article is to undertake a financial evaluation of the clean energy producing vessel design concept. This is achieved by developing a financial model comprising cost and revenue modular elements that reflect the major technical components of the design concept: the floating production, storage and offloading unit; the electrical generation plant; cable transmission; carbon capture and electricity prices. The results for net present value and internal rate of return are derived for all combinations of either high- or low-revenue scenarios and for high- or low-cost scenarios. With a rather low internal rate of return of just 15.53%, the only scenario that yields a positive outcome is that of the high-revenue and low-cost combination.

This PIRE project leverages substantial existing investments in Africa by the Millennium Villages Project (MVP) to mount an international and interdisciplinary study of this great challenge. One of the goals of the MVP is to increase food security by providing local populations in 14 Millennium Villages (MVs) with agricultural interventions such as mineral fertilizers and high-yield seeds. This PIRE project builds upon the MVP's rigorous ongoing evaluation of responses to this agricultural intensification and adds a new dimension of analysis by examining the impacts of the agricultural intensification on land use decisions, human well-being, and ecosystem services at the local and landscape levels. This project focuses on two MVs, in Sauri, Kenya and Mbola, Tanzania. It also incorporates the wealth of data, including survey and field measurements and analyses of remotely sensed imagery, from all 14 MVs across Africa. There are three main experimental components of this project. First, the PIRE team will examine how agricultural intensification acts within communities using indicators such as land-use change, human well-being, ecosystem function, and biodiversity. Second, they will analyze the larger MVP dataset to examine how population density, degree of landscape modification, and climate influence responses to agricultural intensification. Third, for a subset of MVs and nearby non-MV control villages, the team will take measurements of ecosystem function and analyze the impacts of agricultural intensification over time. Faculty, graduate, and undergraduate students from the U.S. and African universities will study both the social and biological consequences of the MVP agricultural interventions. The interdisciplinary expertise of the PIRE team will enable the team to, for example, combine social survey data with satellite remote sensing data to test whether agriculture intensification within MVs actually saves land for nature by changing behaviors such that outside the villages there is reduced agricultural activity and reduced conversion of natural areas to agriculture. The project aims to create a multi-institutional, multinational, and interdisciplinary educational environment for students and faculty from three U.S. institutions and two African institutions. Cross-cultural mentoring and collaboration is a focus for participants at all levels, benefitting U.S. and African students and faculty. Approximately 50 U.S. undergraduate and Masters students will receive scientific training through core courses, field courses, workshops, and internships. U.S. Ph.D. students will be supported for MVP-focused research theses projects and receive language training in Swahili before spending substantial time in East Africa collaborating with African partners. Project faculty will develop a new interdisciplinary and international course on the Natural and Social Dynamics of Land-Use Change using data from Africa and engaging African faculty and students. The project will provide U.S. students with international and interdisciplinary research training in the context of sustaining food production and ecosystem services in developing countries. By examining the impact of MV interventions on people and the environment, the project will provide information that could guide future policies for enhancing human wellbeing, food security, and environmental conservation in one of the world's most impoverished regions. This PIRE project will draw upon the individual strengths of the U.S. and African universities and combine them with several existing African research networks to form research and education networks ideally positioned to conduct this interdisciplinary research. The U.S. institutions will also benefit because the project will give both senior and junior faculty invaluable international experience in designing and conducting a large multinational research project, in training students via international collaboration, and in managing the logistics of a complex project in Africa. The PIRE project will also improve access to international research experiences for U.S. students from groups underrepresented in science via collaborations with the Leadership Alliance (RI), Dillard University (LA), and the Ecological Society of America's Strategies for Ecology Education, Diversity and Sustainability (SEEDS) program. This PIRE is a partnership among Brown University (RI), The Earth Institute of Columbia University (NY), The Ecosystems Center of the Marine Biological Laboratory (MA) and foreign partners at the Moi University (Kenya) and Sokoine University (Tanzania).

This was accomplished in a full-mission marine simulator as the venue for a systematic investigation. In the simulator, volunteer participants from a range of seafaring experience levels were tasked with individually completing ice management tasks. Recorded from 36 individuals' simulations, we compared ice management effectiveness metrics against two independent variables: (i) experience level of the participant, categorized as either cadet or seafarer and (ii) ice severity, measured in ice concentration. The results showed a significant difference in ice management effectiveness between experience categories. We examined what the seafarers did that made them more effective and characterized their operational tactics. The research provides insight into the relative importance of vessel operator skills in contributing to effective ice management, as well as how this relative importance changes as ice conditions vary from mild to severe.

The PACs in wood frog tadpoles were similar to 2x higher on average when the animals were in direct contact with PAC-contaminated sediment than when they were separated from the sediment with a screen and exposed only to aqueous PACs. These results suggest that sediment exposure/ingestion contributes as much to PAC accumulation in tadpoles as exposure via aqueous pathways. Alkyl-substituted PAC concentrations in exposed tadpoles exceeded those of the unsubstituted (parent) PACs by about 10 x. Bioaccumulation factors ranged between 0.01 and 4.93, with parent PACs having higher bioaccumulation factors than alkylated PACs. Wood frog tadpoles efficiently eliminated and metabolized most parent and alkyl-substituted PACs, though some compounds (e.g., C4-naphthalenes) had higher bioaccumulation potential and may serve as effective markers of exposure.

The most efficient way to prevent the negative effects of wind power plants is to avoid building on presumably high-risk sites, which requires an understanding of the movement patterns and habitat use of vulnerable species. The White-tailed Eagle (Haliaeetus albicilla) is vulnerable to wind energy in terms of both collision mortality and displacement due to disturbance. We used satellite transmitters to study the movements of juvenile and sub-adult White-tailed Eagles. We developed a Resource Selection Function (RSF) to model their habitat use at the Finnish coast, which holds about 80% of all planned and constructed wind power plants in the country. In addition, we made a collision risk assessment by calculating how likely areas are to be visited by a flying White-tailed Eagle at both planned and existing wind-farm areas. Our resource selection model predicted 83% of the observations correctly. We found that sub-adult White-tailed Eagles preferred areas close to their natal sites, the coastline and archipelagos. They avoided the open sea, urban areas and other constructed areas such as cottages, industrial areas and agricultural fields. The White-tailed Eagles flew lower over the sea (median 20 m) than over land (median 80 m), and time spent flying at risk heights (50-200 meters) was greater over land (28%) than over the sea (19%). Due to preferences for different habitat types and varying flight heights, our estimates of relative collision risks differed up to 1,000-fold at the Finnish coast. This illustrates the power of our resource selection model, which can be used to model White-tailed Eagle flying behaviour and habitat use in any given area and provide useful information for landscape planning when searching for the safest areas for wind-energy development.",,,,,,,,,7,0,0,0,6,0,8,,,0030-5685,,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Oulu, Ecol & Genet Res Unit, POB 3000, Oulu 90014, FinlandUniv Turku, Dept Biol, Sect Ecol, FI-20014 Turku, FinlandNat Resources Inst Finland, LUKE, Itainen Pitkakatu 4, Turku 20520, Finland",,,,2019-02-01,WOS:000456258000001,,

Extensive outcrops of in situ branching Acropora corals, together with Porites microatolls, Tridacna, and other shallow marine biota, indicate that the present low-lying area of interconnecting lakes in the island interior formed as a reticulate lagoon. Radiocarbon dating indicates that these lagoonal reefs flourished between 4500 and 1500 radiocarbon years BP, and surveying confirms that sea level was 0.5-1.0 m above present at that time, with subaerial exposure resulting from Late Holocene emergence. Boreholes undertaken for a water resources survey of the island penetrated near-surface Pleistocene limestones on the northern, southern, and eastern sides of the island. These are highly weathered and fractured, and although aragonitic clasts are preserved, U-series dating indicates a Middle Pleistocene or older age. At one location flanking the Bay of Wrecks, an outcrop of limestone, with an erosional notch, 1-2 m above present sea level, yielded a U-series age of 130 ka, and is interpreted as Last Interglacial in age. In contrast to previous interpretations which have suggested that Christmas Island comprised an atoll superstructure that is entirely Holocene, or the layer-cake interpretation appropriate for many mid-ocean atolls, Christmas Island appears to have had a form similar to its present in the Middle Pleistocene or earlier. It has undergone karstification during lowstands. Interglacials, particularly the Last Interglacial and the Holocene, appear to have resulted in only a minor veneer of coral over older limestone surfaces.

As an archipelagic country that has a wide range of natural resources and high biodiversity, Indonesia has great potential to be adversely affected by climate change and also has great potential to contribute in its mitigation and adaptation to its negative impacts. The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) sets out several targets for reducing Green House Gas (GHG) emissions in the context of climate change mitigation. Blue carbon in Indonesia is stored in the marine environment and has great potential as an absorber or hoarder of carbon dioxide that can reduce GHG emissions. Indonesia's coastal and marine areas have the potential to absorb approximately 138 million tonnes of carbon equivalent per year or five times more than the potential absorption of tropical forest ecosystems in Indonesia. The carbon sequestration potential can reduce 25% of global carbon emissions. The amount of carbon storage shows that the ocean can play an important role in climate change mitigation.

J,,,,,,,,,Amanda Coles,,Maximising Efficiency of Resource Usage Under Uncertainty in AI Planning,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Awarded Grant,Nov 01 2011,2011,"In recent years planning technology has a enjoyed significant increase in real-world application, with industry and general science research benefiting from the great depth theoretical work done in this area over many decades. The core problem of deciding which activities to carry out and when occurs in a vast range of domains; the research area of planning is concerned with developing generic problem solving technology that automates the task of performing this core reasoning. Planning technology has been employed in a wide range of domains including controlling printing presses, power management for the UK National, train scheduling on the Hungarian Railway Network, scheduling aircraft landing in airports, and autonomous robotic control, both in space and in the oceans. Experience in these areas has given rise to two key observations. First, the existing theoretical work done in AI Planning has been extremely valuable, allowing planning technology to begin to solve real world problems. Planning is a fundamental component of intelligent autonomous behaviour and as such planning technology has real potential for application in many different areas, both now and in the future. The second is that whilst one can observe that planners can now begin to be applied to these problems, there is still a great need for improvement of the underlying technology, in terms of expressivity and performance, in order to be able to create greater autonomy by allowing reasoning about an uncertain world.At the heart of this lies deeply theoretical computer science research: a planner is a generic problem solving system, consisting of search algorithms and heuristics. Of particular interest is reasoning about time and resources, something key to many areas of computer science, from compilers and programming languages to web services and optimisation. In order to tackle application problems well, reasoning effectively about these is essential. Of specific interest here is uncertainty in time taken and resources consumed. This occurs in many application domains, and in each of these a similar approach is taken: conservatism about time and resource availability in order to guarantee success. This, however, comes at a cost. By way of example, when planning for autonomous Martian exploration, the models used by both the ESA and NASA are pessimistic, underestimating the amount of power the rover will receive from the sun, and overestimating the amount of energy and time each activity will take. The result is that the equipment is highly under-utilised, with fewer science targets being achieved than could have been with better on-board reasoning. Given the expense of placing rovers on Mars and the limited equipment lifespan, this is a great cost to mankind's exploration of space. A similar problem occurs when deploying renewable energy generation: wind farms are assumed to provide 10% of their maximum output, even thought the reality is almost always greater than this. This conservative assumption, there to ensure power is always provided, causes great environmental and economic cost, as extra production capacity must be available through other sources regardless of whether it is required.The major benefit of planning is in generating a generic problem solving technology. Developing several bespoke solvers would take many years, and incur great financial cost. By developing efficient planning systems, a single domain-independent problem-solving core is built, capable of solving many problems without the cost of developing a bespoke solver for each. The core of this research is addressing challenges in solving the general planning problem that will allow future application of planning, extending the range of problems to which this generic technology can be applied.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,EP/H029001/2,,,,,,,,King's College London,,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:15358576,,

Accordingly, we performed a meta-analysis to model a restoration trajectory of total macroinfauna density in constructed marshes (studied for similar to 30 y), and with a previously published restoration trajectory for amphipods, we compared these to recovery curves for total macroinfauna and amphipods from DWH impacted marshes (over 8.5 y). Total macroinfauna and amphipod densities in constructed marshes did not consistently reach equivalency with reference sites before 20 y, yet in heavily oiled marshes recovery occurred by 4.5 y post spill (although it is unlikely that macroinfaunal community composition fully recovered). These differences were probably due to initial conditions (e.g., higher initial levels of belowground organic matter in oiled marshes) that were more conducive to recovery as compared to constructed marshes. Furthermore, we found that amphipod trajectories were distinctly different in constructed and oiled marshes as densities at oiled sites exceeded that of reference sites by as much as 20x during much of the recovery period. Amphipods may have responded to the rapid increase and high biomass of benthic microalgae following the spill. These results indicate that biotic responses after an oil spill may be quantitatively different than those following restoration, even for heavily oiled marshes that were initially denuded of vegetation.

The fellowship supports a research and training plan for the Fellow that will increase the participation of groups underrepresented in biology. Salt marshes are coastal wetlands that provide several important ecosystem services, including storm surge protection, nutrient removal, and carbon sequestration. Their potential as an efficient carbon sink is largely mediated by microbes that use organic matter to fuel respiration, and as a result, control the balance between decomposition and long term storage of carbon. Despite their importance, very little is known about the microbes living within these marsh sediments, their distribution, and what forms of carbon different microbial groups can use. Further, increased nitrogen production and fertilizer runoff has drastically altered these coastal wetland systems in unknown ways, particularly with regard to the type and activity of microbes inhabiting them. This research will provide new information on microbial groups contributing to long term carbon storage, a valuable ecosystem service, as well as valuable insight into how salt marshes respond to environmental change. The fellow aims to broaden participation in science by organizing and implementing a virtual mentorship program developed specifically for community college students. Salt marshes are host to a remarkable, but poorly characterized, diversity of microbial taxa. This research aims to deeply sequence targeted groups of microbes capable of degrading complex organic matter using RNA Stable Isotope Probing (RNA-SIP), which allows for characterization of organisms that preferentially incorporate labeled substrate. When coupled with genomic sequencing, RNA-SIP provides a unique opportunity to 1) examine the structure and distribution of microbes along a depth gradient; 2) assess changes, if any, to these microbial groups under elevated nitrate conditions, which have been shown to stimulate decomposition of complex organic matter by providing an energetically favorable electron acceptor; and 3) investigate patterns in gene expression, particularly catabolic genes associated with carbon degradation, using metatranscriptomics. Overall, this research will offer insight into the microbial consortia responsible for controlling long term carbon storage in deep salt marsh sediments. In addition to this research, the fellow aims to broaden participation in science by organizing and implementing a virtual mentorship program developed specifically for community college students. Community colleges serve nearly half of the undergraduate population in the United States, however traditional STEM training programs tend to overlook these massive talent pools. This virtual community college STEM network therefore aims to increase engagement, and thus improve diversity, inclusivity, and retention of scientists from all backgrounds.

It is found that source rocks have controlled oil and gas distribution, and they are mainly formed in two systems: (1) river-lake systems and (2) river-gulf systems. Phytoplankton is an important source of kerogen, the blooming of which is strongly dependent on nutrients. Rivers are the major nutrient provider for basins. Rivers around lakes and an undercompensation (where the sedimentation rate is less than the rate of basin subsidence) environment provide favorable conditions for phytoplankton blooming in lakes. Gulfs are usually located at the estuary of big rivers, characterized by restricted current circulation and exchange with the open sea, which benefit maintaining the nutrient density, phytoplankton levels and organic matter preservation. The river-gulf system is the most favorable place for marine source rock development. Most of the world famous marine petroleum-rich provinces are developed from river-gulf systems in geological history, such as the Persian Gulf Basin, Siberian Basin, Caspian Basin, North Sea, Sirte Basin, Nigerian Basin, Kwanza Basin, Gulf of Mexico, Maracaibo Basin and the Eastern Venezuelan Basin.",,,,,,,,,8,6,0,0,0,0,11,,,1672-5107,,,,,,,,,,,"CNOOC Res Inst, Beijing 100027, Peoples R China",,,,2012-09-19,WOS:000307715000002,,
J,,,,,,,,,"Belas, M. Robert",,Genetic Analysis of the Roseobacter-Dinoflagellate Interaction,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Awarded Grant,Feb 01 2005,2005,"Members of the Roseobacter clade of the a-proteobacteria are among the most abundant and ecologically relevant marine bacterial groups. Roseobacter isolates and gene sequences derived from them have been retrieved from marine environments ranging from sea ice to open ocean mixed layer to tropical coral reefs, and in ecological niches ranging from free-living plankton to sponge symbiont to biofilm pioneer. Although Roseobacter are cosmopolitan in the marine environment, their numbers and activity significantly rise with increases in the population density of phytoplankton and dinoflagellates. However, little is known about the cellular factors and molecular mechanisms required for roseobacters to move towards and remain in the phycosphere surrounding phytoplankton and dinoflagellates. The long-term goal of this research is to understand the signals and molecular mechanisms used to initiate and maintain the interaction between the roseobacter and its eukaryotic host. Members of the Roseobacter clade are prevalent and often numerically dominant in laboratory cultures of dinoflagellates. They are found within the dinoflagellate's phycosphere or attached to its surface. Axenic cultures of dinoflagellates grow poorly compared to cultures with associated bacterial assemblages, and adding back either a single isolate (Silicibacter TM1040) or mixed bacterial assemblages restores normal growth. TM1040 actively metabolizes the dinoflagellate secondary metabolite dimethylsulfoniopropionate (DMSP), and is motile and chemotactically attracted to dinoflagellate homogenates, DMSP, amino acids, and other chemicals released by the dinoflagellate. The research will test the following hypothesis: Roseobacter clade bacteria establish the initial interaction with their eukaryotic partners through a response to dinoflagellate signals, e.g., DMSP, and chemotaxis-driven swimming. This behavior brings the bacteria into close physical association with their eukaryotic host, at which point other bacterial gene products are expressed in response to dinoflagellate-derived signals to maintain the interaction. Using TM1040 as a model, the specific objectives of this research are to (1) analyze flagellar arrangement, morphology, energetics, and chemotaxis of TM1040; (2) identify potential genes involved in the bacterial-dinoflagellate interaction through a comparative genomics analysis of Silicibacter TM1040, S. pomeroyi DSS-3, and Jannaschia sp. CCS-1; and, (3) use genetic techniques to identify and characterize the genes affecting the bacteria-dinoflagellate interactions, and analyze how each mutation affects the interaction between bacteria and dinoflagellates. The results of this research will be important to current research efforts in marine microbial ecology and will benefit society through a better understanding of the effect of Roseobacter/dinoflagellate interactions as they affect nutrient cycling, especially sulfur cycling, in the world's oceans, and may have implications to global climate control.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,446001,,,,,,,,University of Maryland Biotechnology Institute,University of Maryland Biotechnology Institute,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:13719835,,

The plant nutrients remaining after digestion are recycled to expand the algal forest and increase fish populations. A mass balance has been calculated from known data and applied to produce a life cycle assessment and economic analysis. This analysis shows the potential of Ocean Afforestation to produce 12 billion tons per year of biomethane while storing 19 billion tons of CO2 per year directly from biogas production, plus up to 34 billion tons per year from carbon capture of the biomethane combustion exhaust. These rates are based on macro-algae forests covering 9% of the world's ocean surface, which could produce sufficient biomethane to replace all of today's needs in fossil fuel energy, while removing 53 billion tons of CO2 per year from the atmosphere, restoring pre-industrial levels. This amount of biomass could also increase sustainable fish production to potentially provide 200 kg/yr/person for 10 billion people.

This paper proposes a new optimal method for platform navigation between adjacent wells, specifically, a platform of hang-off drilling riser navigation method. The mechanical properties of the suspended riser are analyzed using finite element simulations. Comparing the differences in stress and bending moments using static and dynamic analysis methods, the concept of hang-off drilling riser navigation between adjacent wells is first introduced, and then, a model is developed which takes into account the platform speed and the suspended length, speed, direction, and heading of the riser.

Such information is needed in real-time to support tactical applications for safe routing of ships in heavy sea ice concentrations and, more recently, a need for tactical support of offshore oil and gas activities in ice infested waters of the Arctic Ocean and in marginal ice areas such as the Sea of Okhotsk, the Caspian Sea, Baffin Bay, the Labrador Sea and East Greenland waters. Reliable upward looking sonar (ULS) instruments, including the ASL Ice Profiler for ice keel measurements and the Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler for Ice Velocity measurements have been widely used in these areas for many years. These instruments, which record data internally, are operated from subsurface moorings that are deployed and recovered by ship during times of minimal sea ice coverage.Providing real-time measurements from the upward looking sonar measurements operating under heavy ice cover pose new technological challenges. The use of surface buoys to relay data from subsurface instruments to shore facilities or satellites is not possible due to the ice cover itself. A more feasible approach is to transmit the data from each instrument using underwater cables on the sea floor and which link the instruments on the subsurface moorings to a bottom mounted or floating structure. For a floating structure, the use of high performance acoustic modems may be required.Previous experience with real-time ULS ice measurement systems is presented based on operational projects undertaken from 2002 to the present. The projects are based on experience in the St. Lawrence Seaway (since 2002), and more recent work at the Confederation Bridge in Canada (2005-2008), and the Caspian Sea (2008). The approaches taken to addressing the real-time measurement of the subsea ice keels are summarized for each application.More challenging requirements for real-time ULS ice measurement systems are being addressed in much deeper and more remote areas of the Arctic Ocean. In these areas of more prolonged and severe ice conditions, the deployment of the system is limited to late summer periods when ice coverage is reduced. The requirements for timely and accurate ice information demand high reliability in support of ship navigation and offshore oil and gas drilling applications. The real-time ULS ice measurement system must be capable of operating for two to three years without servicing. Multiple ULS measurement arrays will be needed over operational areas spanning distances of many kilometers. For these Arctic Ocean applications, cabled ocean observatory technology and advanced underwater acoustic modems become key enabling technologies.",,,,,Oceans 2009 ConferenceOceans 2009 Conference,"OCT 26-29, 2009OCT 26-29, 2009",Marine Technol Soc; IEEE Ocean Engn SocMarine Technol Soc; IEEE Ocean Engn Soc,"Biloxi, MSBiloxi, MS",1,0,0,0,0,0,1,,,0197-7385,,978-1-4244-4960-6,,,,,,,,,"ASL Environm Sci Inc, Victoria, BC V8L 4Y3, Canada",ASL Environm Sci Inc,,,2009-01-01,WOS:000280322601124,,

A toxicokinetic approach is proposed to evaluate sediment quality by linking chemical and ecotoxicological data along the time. Sediment samples were physicochemically characterized and the concentration of contaminants (Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons - PAHs - and metals) was measured. Fishes were exposed to contaminated sediments, and samples from different tissues were collected every 15 days throughout the 60 days that lasted the experiment. A biomarker of exposure (ethoxyresorufin O-deethylase activity - EROD activity) and a biomarker of effect (histopathology) were analyzed during the exposure period. Results show a relationship between the biomarkers and the concentrations in sediments of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons - PAHs. Besides, the toxicokinetic approach links biomarkers response providing information about the relationship between the detoxification process and the damages observed in the different tissues.

The in-situ survey was carried out from the austral summer till the onset of winter (january 2012, February 2010 and March 2009) in the Enderby Basin. Rapid decrease in pCO(2) was evident under the sea-ice cover in January, when both water column and sea-ice algal activity resulted in the removal of nutrients and dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) and increase in pH. The major highlight of this study is the shift in the dominant biogeochemical factors from summer to early winter. Nutrient limitation (low Si/N), sea-ice cover, low photosynthetically active radiation (PAR), deep mixed layer and high upwelling velocity contributed towards higher pCO(2) during March ( early winter). CO2 fluxes suggest that the Enderby Basin acts as a strong CO2 sink during January (-81 mmol m(-2) d(-1)), however it acts as a weak sink of CO2 with -2.4 and -1.7 mmol m(-2) d(-1) during February and March, respectively. The present work, concludes that sea ice plays a dual role towards climate change, by decreasing sea surface pCO(2) in summer and enhancing in early winter. Our observations emphasize the need to address seasonal sea-ice driven CO2 flux dynamics in assessing Antarctic contributions to the global oceanic CO2 budget.

We aimed to: (1) estimate change in areas environmentally suitable for mires under future climates; (2) evaluate the sensitivities of projected change to uncertainties in future climate and model structure; (3) evaluate the effect of global mitigation actions on distribution change; (4) identify potential climate refuges for future adaptation actions.MethodsWe developed and evaluated correlative bioclimatic models for an Australian mire ecosystem by: (1) selecting environmental predictors representing ecological processes that mediate ecosystem occurrence and dynamics; (2) using a high-performance modelling algorithm; (3) quantifying predictive performance by cross-validation; (4) cross-checking responses to predictor variables between different algorithms; (5) comparing the modelled responses with expected mechanistic responses; (6) evaluating extrapolation risks by quantifying the deviation between future and current environmental domains of the study area and by assessing the temporal constancy of correlations between variables; (7) using a geographically stratified cross-validation to verify spatial consistency of the model; and (8) quantifying the robustness of predictions of climate change impacts to uncertainty in both climate and ecological models.ResultsAll combinations of global circulation models and distribution model projected declines of at least 30% in both area and suitability of environments for the mire ecosystem and in projecting a contraction of range to the southwest. We identified a likely refuge in the south of the distribution and two less certain, emerging areas of suitable environment west and south of the current distribution.Main ConclusionsWe conclude that southern mire ecosystems are highly susceptible to climate change. Our approach will be useful for the prediction of climate impacts on other ecosystems for which there is enough knowledge to map distributions and develop plausible hypotheses about environmental factors that influence them.",,,,,,,,,32,1,0,0,30,0,37,,,1366-9516,1472-4642,,,,,,,,,,"Univ New S Wales, Ctr Ecosyst Sci, Sch Biol Earth & Environm Sci, Sydney, NSW 2052, AustraliaNSW Off Environm & Heritage, Hurstville, VA 22209 USAAustralian Natl Univ, Long Term Ecol Res Network, Terr Ecosyst Res Network, Canberra, ACT 2601, AustraliaUniv Melbourne, Ctr Excellence Biosecur Risk Anal, Sch Bot, Melbourne, Vic 3010, Australia",NSW Off Environm & Heritage,,,2014-06-11,WOS:000332445900007,,

Oil and particle aggregates are formed from the interaction between small oil droplets and suspended particulate matter (SPM). In general, SPM are fine particles which may be inorganic minerals or organic particles in the water column. OSAs provide vertical dispersion of oil along the water column depending on the acquired density (buoyancy), and may remain near the surface, water column, or bottom of water bodies. The present study examines the formation of these aggregates through the laboratory simulation of an oil spill in the waters of the Sao Paulo river estuary. The main objective was to investigate the dispersion of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), verifying which estuary characteristics most influenced the formation of OSAs and in addition to determine the regions of probable ecotoxicological impact due to the negative buoyancy of the formed aggregate. The results show that there was greater dispersion to the water column, mainly of lighter PAHs, ranging from 85,804.05 ng g(-1) (P11C) to 566,989.84 ng g(-1) (P17C). The percentage of dispersed PAH concentration per experimental unit ranged from 9.90% in unit P2 to 75.27% in unit P18. The formation of OSAs was influenced mainly by salinity and chlorophyll a. As the most vulnerable regions, the impacts are one mouth (P2 and P4), one central region (P7, P8, and P10), and one source (P18).",,,,,,,,,2,0,0,0,1,0,2,,,0167-6369,1573-2959,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Fed Bahia, Lepetro Pospetro Inst Geosciences, Rua Barao de Jeremoabo S-N, BR-40170290 Salvador, BA, BrazilUniv Fed Bahia, Polytech Sch, Dept Environm & Sanit Engn, Rua Prof Aristides Novis 2, BR-40210630 Salvador, BA, Brazil",,,,2020-02-20,WOS:000511864300001,31900672,

There is limited research on the effect of dispersed oil on cold water species and ecosystems. Therefore, spiked exposure tests were conducted with bay mussels (Mytilus trossulus) in seawater with non-dispersed oil, Corexit 9500 and oil dispersed with different concentrations of Corexit 9500. After three weeks of exposure, acute and chronic physiological impacts were determined. The majority of physiological responses occurred during the first seven days of exposure, with mussels exhibiting significant cytochrome P450 activity, superoxide dismutase activity and heat shock protein levels. Mussels exposed to non-dispersed oil also experienced immune suppression, reduced transcription and higher levels of mortality. After 21 days, mussels in all treatments exhibited evidence of genetic damage, tissue loss and a continued stress response.

How seasonality affects carbon storage capacity in seagrass meadows is largely unknown, and therefore, in this study, we aimed to assess variations in sedimentary total organic carbon (TOC) content over a 1-year cycle in seagrass meadows on the Swedish west coast. The TOC was measured in two Z. marina sites, one wave exposed and one sheltered, and at two depths (1.5 and 4 m) within each site, every second month from August 2015 to June 2016. We found a strong seasonal variation in carbon density, with a peak in early summer (June), and that the TOC was negatively correlated to the net community production of the meadows, presumably related to organic matter degradation. There was seasonal variation in TOC content at all sediment sections, indicating that the carbon content down to 30 cm is unstable on a seasonal scale and therefore likely not a long-term carbon sink. The yearly mean carbon stocks were substantially higher in the sheltered meadow (3,965 and 3,465 g m(-2)) compared to the exposed one (2,712 and 1,054 g m(-2)) with similar seasonal variation.

Many oil and gas installations are located from 10-100 km from shore. This fact alone creates a major challenge concerning design of reliable and cost efficient land based power supply systems. A large portion of the challenge lays in calculating the impact this new and dominating point loads have on the existing power systems. The onshore grids are not designed for handling large and sudden load increases in a single load point. These grids are also commonly complex and highly meshed which increase considerably the complexity concerning analysis of supply reliability. Furthermore, these extensions of the onshore grids are traditionally only evaluated from an electrical point of view, not from a total system regularity point of view. In Norway we have practical experience regarding this problem. A large part of the power system in the middle of Norway has shown a decrease in power system regularity. This decrease in regularity is a consequence of connecting a large offshore oil and gas installation to the onshore power system.

Responses to a dichotomous choice referendum question on a mail survey sent to a representative sample of WA households were used to estimate residents' Willingness to Pay (WTP) for tidal energy R&D. Public preferences for policies to support tidal energy R&D were also assessed. WA households are WTP between $29M and $127M annually for tidal energy R&D, indicating public preference for an increase in government spending on tidal energy R&D over current levels.

This paper examines the use of remote sensing and spatial ecosystem service modelling to examine nature's contribution to targets under SDG 6, also highlighting synergies with other key SDGs and trade-offs with agriculture.We use a wide range of remotely sensed and globally available datasets (for land cover, climate, soil, population, agriculture) alongside the existing and widely used spatial ecosystem services assessment tool, Co$tingNature. With these we identify priority areas for sustainable management to realise targets under SDG 6 (water) at the country scale for Madagascar and at the basin scale for the Volta basin, though the application developed can be applied to any country or major basin in the world. Within this SDG 6 priority areas footprint, we assess the synergies and trade-offs provided by this land for SDG 15 (biodiversity) and SDG 13 (climate action) as well as SDG 2 (zero hunger).Results highlight the co-benefits of sustainably managing nature's contribution to SDG 6, such as the protection of forest cover (for SDG target 15.2), carbon storage as a contribution to the Paris climate agreement and nationally determined contributions (SDG 13) and biodiversity (for SDG target 15.5) but also trade-offs with the zero hunger goal (for SDG 2). Such analyses allow for better understanding of land management requirements for realising multiple SDGs through protection and restoration of green infrastructure.

STSP is applied to a real case of planning regional ecosystem sustainable development in the City of Dongying, where ecosystem services valuation approaches are incorporated within the optimization process. Regional ecosystem can provide direct and indirect services and intangible benefits to local economy. Land trading mechanism is introduced for planning the regional ecosystem's sustainable development, where wetlands are buyers who would protect regional ecosystem components and self-organization and maintain its integrity. Results of regional ecosystem activities, land use patterns, and land trading schemes have been obtained. Results reveal that, although large-scale reclamation projects can bring benefits to the local economy development, they can also bring with negative effects to the coastal ecosystem; among all industry activities oil field is the major contributor with a large number of pollutant discharges into local ecosystem. Results also show that uncertainty has an important role in successfully launching such a land trading program and trading scheme can provide more effective manner to sustain the regional ecosystem.

Although southern and temperate biological systems have largely cleansed themselves of radioactive fallout deposited during the 1950s and 1960s, Arctic environments have not. Lichens accumulate radioactivity more than many other plants because of their large surface area and long life span; the presence and persistence of radioisotopes in the Arctic is of concern because of the lichen --> reindeer --> human ecosystem.

It takes hydrocarbon through subsea risers and transfers hydrocarbon liquids and gases through swivels to topside process facilities. Traditionally, in offshore projects, it has been a challenge to design, deliver, and install various key equipment, systems, and components on time due to many complicated and different rules and regulations, company’s unique specifications, various design codes and standards in which manufacturers and shipyards might not have sufficient experiences. This causes additional costs in procurement, engineering, manufacturing, installation, and commissioning, which may affect the overall project delivery schedule.

The study design was based on the systematic sample and transect grid used in 2008-2010, but on a coarser scale to cover a greater area in a shorter amount of time. To allow for data continuity, the 2008-2010 prospect-specific study areas remain at the finer transect scale. The overall purpose of the study is to provide to ConocoPhillips, Shell, and Statoil necessary baseline information about the marine environment in their respective lease areas that can be used in applications for permits, in a National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) compliance document, and in other documents to help manage these resources. The study will provide valuable information for the regulatory agencies to conduct realistic evaluations on the potential impacts of oil and gas activities and thus issue permits with reasonable stipulations and guidance. Importantly, it will also contribute to the overall knowledge of the northeastern Chukchi Sea marine ecosystem. This dataset is part of the Pacific Marine Arctic Regional Synthesis (PacMARS) Project.

The synergistic integration of algae production, which does not require arable land or freshwater, with BECCS (called ABECCS) can reduce CO2 emissions without competing with agriculture. This study presents a technoeconomic and life-cycle assessment for colocating a 121-ha algae facility with a 2,680-ha eucalyptus forest for BECCS. The eucalyptus biomass fuels combined heat and power (CHP) generation with subsequent amine-based carbon capture and storage (CCS). A portion of the captured CO2 is used for growing algae and the remainder is sequestered. Biomass combustion supplies CO2, heat, and electricity, thus increasing the range of sites suitable for algae cultivation. Economic, energetic, and environmental impacts are considered. The system yields as much protein as soybeans while generating 61.5TJ of electricity and sequestering 29,600t of CO2 per year. More energy is generated than consumed and the freshwater footprint is roughly equal to that for soybeans. Financial break-even is achieved for product value combinations that include 1) algal biomass sold for $1,400/t (fishmeal replacement) with a $68/t carbon credit and 2) algal biomass sold for $600/t (soymeal replacement) with a $278/t carbon credit. Sensitivity analysis shows significant reductions to the cost of carbon sequestration are possible. The ABECCS system represents a unique technology for negative emissions without reducing protein production or increasing water demand, and should therefore be included in the suite of technologies being considered to address global sustainability.Plain Language Summary We evaluated the sustainability of integrating algae production with bioenergy CCS (called ABECCS). Our motivation is to devise an affordable system that removes CO2 from the atmosphere without negatively impacting food security. The International Panel on Climate Change suggested that in addition to zero-emissions systems (such as solar power or crops), negative-emissions systems are needed to mitigate global warming. Bioenergy CCS (BECCS) is a promising negative-emissions approach in which biomass is combusted to generate electricity in conjunction with CCS. However, on a scale relevant to mitigating global warming, the arable land and freshwater requirements for BECCS could be unviable and cause competition with food production. In the ABECCS system, soy cropland is replaced by eucalyptus forests used for BECCS that provides marine algae with CO2, heat, and electricity. The integrated 2,800-ha facility produces as much high-quality protein as soy without increasing freshwater demand, and generates 61.5 TJ of electricity while sequestering 29,600t of CO2 per year. The system is economically viable when receiving $600/t of algae and $278/t of CO2 sequestered. With favorable economic conditions, ABECCS could contribute to the reduction of CO2 in the atmosphere in a sustainable way.",,,,,,,,,53,2,0,0,15,0,60,,,,2328-4277,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Hawaii, Coll Agr Forestry & Nat Resource Management, Hilo, HI 96720 USAB&D Engn & Consulting LLC, Lander, WY 74456 USACinglas Ltd, Chester, Cheshire, EnglandCornell Univ, Dept Biol & Environm Engn, Ithaca, NY USADuke Univ, Biol Dept, Beaufort, NC USADuke Univ, Marine Lab, Beaufort, NC 28516 USACornell Univ, Dept Earth & Atmospher Sci, Ithaca, NY USA",B&D Engn & Consulting LLCCinglas Ltd,,,2018-04-30,WOS:000430171600016,,

The wave-structure interaction system was identified using the NARX (Nonlinear Autoregressive with Exogenous Input) technique, and the network parameters were determined through supervised training using prepared datasets. The dataset used for network training was obtained by nonlinear finite element analysis of the slender marine structure under random ocean waves of white noise. The nonlinearities involved in the analysis were both large deformation of the structure under consideration and the quadratic term of the relative velocity between the water particle and structure in the Morison formula. The linear and quadratic frequency response functions of the given system were extracted using the multi-tone harmonic probing method and the time series of the response of the structure was predicted using the quadratic Volterra series. To check the applicability of the method, the response of a slender marine structure under a realistic ocean wave environment with a given significant wave height and modal period was predicted and compared with the nonlinear time domain simulation results. The predicted time series of the response of structure with quadratic Volterra series successfully captured the slowly varying response with reasonably good accuracy. This method can be used to predict the response of the slender offshore structure exposed to a Morison type load without relying on the computationally expensive time domain analysis, especially for screening purposes.

Such an intelligent system, which is condition driven is developed and described in this paper. Since relevant process data is unavailable in the literature, a dynamic model of an offshore oil and gas production platform was developed using gPROMS and data to reflect operating conditions under normal, fault conditions and maintenance activities were simulated. The different maintenance activities and normal conditions are explicitly considered as separate states of the process. The simulated data are then used to train principal component analysis monitoring models for each of these states.

J,"Carter, Caroline",,,,,,,,,,Understanding the potential for marine megafauna entanglement risk from marine renewable energy developments.,,,,,,,,Scottish Natural Heritage Commissioned Report,,,,791,,,,i,"ii, 1-87",,,,,,,,,,,Article,2014,2014,"Background The global marine renewable energy (MRE) industry (including offshore wind, wave and tidal energy) is developing rapidly, particularly in Scotland where the Scottish Government is driving growth of the industry as part of their sustainable development agenda. As increasing numbers of devices are set to be deployed, concerns have been raised over potential environmental impacts. One such potential impact of marine renewable energy development is the risk of whales, basking sharks and other large animals (marine megafauna) becoming entangled in mooring systems and associated power cables. Given the widespread occurrence of marine megafauna injury and mortality through entanglement and bycatch in fishing gear, the issue poses potentially serious conservation concerns. Main findings The present report set out to review existing information on entanglement risks to marine megafauna posed by moorings. Based on an extensive literature review, it was concluded that moorings such as those proposed for MRE devices will likely pose a relatively modest risk in terms of entanglement for most marine megafauna, particularly when compared to risk posed by fisheries. Nevertheless, some circumstances were identified where moorings associated with MRE devices could potentially pose a risk, particularly, 1) in cases involving large baleen whales and, 2) if derelict fishing gears become attached to the mooring, thereby posing an entanglement risk for a wide range of species (including fish and diving seabirds). In the absence of significant amounts of empirical data, a qualitative risk assessment approach was developed to assess relative risks to marine megafauna groups on the basis of biological and physical risk parameters. Biological risk factors included body size, animals' ability to detect moorings, animals' body flexibility and general feeding modes. Physical risk factors were defined as mooring tension characteristics, swept volume and curvature. Mooring behaviours were dynamically modelled for six different mooring types (catenary (three different compositions), catenary with accessory buoy, taut, taut with accessory buoy) using OrcaFlex(TM) software to assess the physical risk factors under different sea states. In order to inform the risk assessment, biological and physical risk factors were combined to populate a relative risk matrix for all modelled moorings. Results suggest that for most megafauna, MRE device moorings are unlikely to pose a major threat; however, it should be remembered that cetaceans (as European Protected Species) and basking sharks are afforded legal protection at the individual level in Scotland and therefore should be considered accordingly. Baleen whales were considered to be at greatest relative risk overall, largely due to their size and foraging habits. Some mooring designs presented a greater relative risk than others, with the greater relative risks generated by catenary moorings, particularly those containing nylon. Taut systems represented the lowest relative risk. Most moorings associated with MRE devices would likely be too strong for animals to easily break free if they became entangled. Entanglement risks among MRE arrays will likely vary substantially based on device spacing, mooring design and array layout. Currently MRE development proposals often vary in the degree of detail provided about the moorings' physical properties, complicating attempts by regulators to assess different mooring systems for entanglement risk. The qualitative risk assessment approach described in this report enables device developers and regulatory bodies to assess potential entanglement risks at an early stage of the development of a MRE proposal, allowing appropriate risk management and enabling mitigation strategies to be developed if necessary. Recommendations include the following: -When submitting a development proposal, developers should be encouraged to follow the relative risk assessment process outlined in this report, and to provide details of existing and planned routine inspection regimes involving moorings. -During the consent period of devices and arrays, a procedure needs to be put in place which would require developers to report to regulators any significant changes to mooring and MRE device behaviour over time if such changes would increase the risk of marine megafauna entanglement. -There is a need for the establishment of an official reporting mechanism by which developers can report the presence of marine megafauna entanglement in MRE device moorings to the regulator (e.g. Marine Scotland who will need to be aware for HRA and EPS purposes). -A formal accident investigation procedure needs to be put in place by the developer, in order that in the event of an entanglement the appropriate authorities are alerted to allow all relevant information to be recorded, and to trigger an assessment by the regulator into whether any emergency measures were required. -Details of moorings relevant to the risk of entanglement of marine megafauna should be included alongside Marine Licence applications and within Environmental Statements. -Further investigations are needed to clarify the distribution and abundance of derelict fishing gear in Scottish waters, and the extent to which gear becomes snagged in moorings or other vertical structures in the water column. -Further research may be required to assess the full range of entanglement mitigation options available to the MRE industry, to minimise any risks of entanglement events occurring. -Further research may be required to assess the effects of redistribution of fishing effort displaced from MRE development sites, to ensure that marine megafauna entanglement/bycatch risks are not merely displaced or exacerbated elsewhere as a result.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,1759-4014,,,,,,,,,,,"Scottish Nat Heritage, Redgorton, Perth, PH1 3EW, United Kingdom",,,,2014-01-01,ZOOREC:ZOOR15412081167,,

The migration and filling model presented in this paper suggests that the oil and gas represent two different migration phases and that gas migration and filling predate oil emplacement. Two different oil populations have been characterized and mapped in Troll field applying conventional geochemical techniques. We suggest that the two oil populations migrated into the structure through two different migration systems. Oil and gas were subsequently biodegraded within the reservoir. The two oil populations have been found in neighboring oil and gas discoveries, and an oil-oil correlation with these discoveries has been used to determine the location of field filling points and regional migration routes. When oil biodegradation terminated, fresh oil continued to migrate into the reservoir and mixed with the residue of the biodegraded oil.

For EPA regulations to be implemented there have to be a road map as to how this can be done without major impact on the cost or efficiency of power generation. The thermal plants in India have a thermal efficiency of about 35% and an emission ratio of 0.90 kg/kWh of CO2 emissions as published by Central Electricity Authority (CEA). The reduction of 33% intensity as promised by India at COP-21: Paris; would translate to a decrease of CO2 emissions to a level of 0.58 kg/kWh by 2030. This decrease is possible by a combination of abatement and recycling measures like augmentation of Low Carbon Technologies (LCT) such as Renewable and Clean Coal Technologies (CCT) and Carbon Capture & Sequestration (CCS) on our Fossil Fuel based thermal power plants. However, as regards post combustion CCS plants on coal fired units, the CO2 capture by an amine system of 30% CO2 capture would mean an energy penalty of about 25% including a minimum of 10% for compression and pumping to deep reserves like mineral rocks, gas hydrates and ocean. In any case, the energy penalty in Indian context, when CO2 sequestration is considered a far more appropriate option than CO2 storage the energy penalty still remains at level of 15%. This can be further reduced to a level of 4-5% if solar thermal device is used for production of steam for an amine solvent regeneration and stripping of CO2. The same can be demonstrated only after establishment of pilot plant of CO2 Capture and Sequestration plant integrated with Concentrated Solar Power (CSP) for carrying out system optimization studies, having variable fluid dynamic configuration.The paper covers description and test results of Post Combustion Carbon Capture & Sequestration Pilot Plant installed at the Rajiv Gandhi Proudyogiki Vishwavidyalya (RGPV), Bhopal in Central India, for CO2 capture and conversion into fuel molecules like H-2 and CH4 from associated Oil fired Boiler and a Biomass gasifier. A feasibility study of installation of CCS on a 500MW unit together with integration of solar concentrator for steam generation for reducing energy penalty in regeneration is also presented.

Therefore, the aim of this study was to assess the rate of biodegradation on four underwater cultural heritage sites in different marine environments by placing a series of wooden test panels in direct contact with the exposed structure on the sites. Upon recovery, test panels were photographed, X-rayed, and wood boring and sessile fouling species were identified and counted. The damage attributed to each species was recorded with CAD software. Results indicated a significant difference between sites, with HMS Invincible having the highest abundance of marine wood borers and the highest rate of surface area and volume degradation; whilst vestigial evidence of marine wood borers was found on the London, it would appear the environmental conditions had significantly impeded their survival.

Diversified human usage of all kinds of natural resources is getting more controversial. A deep revaluation of existing methods and management approaches is needed in accordance with the complexities of Russian social/economic and ecological factors in the Arctic. The modern challenge of transition towards sustainable development also needs to be reevaluated. The last decade has shown a real effort of all Arctic countries to expand cooperation in joint scientific multidisciplinary studies. The studies are aimed at elaboration of common views on Arctic development and protection of environment. Moreover, the Arctic shelf and coastal zone are getting a new arena of international investments for industrial projects and implementation due to recovery of huge deposits of oil and gas resources of sophisticated technologies.

J,,,,,,,,,Alastair Lewis,,Improved understanding of accidental releases from oil and gas industries offshore.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Awarded Grant,Jan 01 2015,2015,"A wide range of potential scenarios exist where an uncontrolled or accidental release of chemicals to the ocean and atmosphere may occur, arising from offshore oil and gas industrial activities. These encompass gas and liquid leaks during the drilling and extraction process, potentially including hydrocarbon evaporation to air from surface seawater pollution, and the loss of bulk or refined products during hydrocarbon transport via pipelines and shipping. Such releases have the potential to create major environmental impacts, result in suspension of activities with associated losses of industrial and government revenues and cause severe reputational damage to companies. Undoubtedly many small incidents pose little environmental threat but the paucity of background data makes it difficult to separate significant from insignificant events.Emissions to the atmosphere from routine operational activities are legislated via national and international agreements. However there is very limited scientific or technical capability to support environmental decision-making during one-off or uncontrolled releases to air. The BP Deepwater Horizon accident in 2010 showed a lack of capability within both industry and regulators to undertake a rapid assessment of the scale of emissions, and a complete absence of background atmospheric data against which the impacts of the event could be compared. Off-shore atmospheric releases are particularly difficult to respond to - only large and well equipped research aircraft with long range/duration can make the necessary low level boundary layer measurements in the field. Aircraft sampling platforms must be supported by a functional deployment plan with a tested experimental design, advanced laboratory capabilities for gas phase measurement and traceability, and appropriate dispersion modelling. This NERC innovation project aims to address directly a number of lessons-learned from the response to the Total Elgin event, and create a much-improved robust capability to support decision-making for future events, in the North sea and elsewhere. The project aims to translate environmental science and technology capabilities to support decision-making in the oil and gas sector in the event of accidental events.Key aims are as follows:1. Using a set of representative FAAM146 survey flights establish the background variability and spatial distributions of methane and non-methane hydrocarbons in regions of intensive existing oil and gas activity in the North Sea.2. Apply innovative atmospheric dispersion modelling tools, in combination with the new background data, to estimate a statistical distribution of the scale and extent of existing fugitive sources from current activities. 3. Develop and test a response plan for the detection and characterisation of evaporative emissions from liquid spills to the sea-surface, including bulk materials and refined products, through modification of an atmospheric science research instrument already certified for the FAAM aircraft.4. Working with the FAAM aircraft operators develop an operational plan and safety case for the fast deployment of the aircraft for detection and response to oil and gas events in the Arctic ocean.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,NE/M007146/1,,,,,,,,University of York,University of York,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:15413204,,

Quantitative Risk Analysis (QRA) is the systematic use of available information to identify hazards and probabilities, and to predict the possible consequences to individuals or populations, property or the environment. Traditionally both methods have been used separately; however both accident investigation and QRA describe hazards in a systematic way. The extensive research that is done related to that including human and organisational factors in QRA brings accident investigation and QRA closer together. Every year there are a large number of precursor incidents recorded with the potential to cause major accidents risks in the North Sea oil and gas industry, This article describes how accident investigation and QRA can be combined using available information from a precursor incident as input to QRA-methodology to identify hazards, probabilities, safety barriers and possible consequences. The combined method is shortened as QRA PII (Quantitative Risk Analysis Precursor Incident Investigation) and makes use of well known hazard analysis techniques to produce a more complete cause and risk picture in complex systems. This includes an extended understanding of human and organisational factors in accidents and prevention of these. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Thus, it is important to (further) explore and exploit the marine environment which covers no less than 71% of the earth's surface. The marine environment is very complex but can roughty be divided into two systems: natural (e.g. wild fishing) and human-made (e.g. artificial islands). In this study, characterization factors (CF) for natural and human-made marine systems were calculated in order to be able to assess the environmental impact of occupying marine surfaces, which was not possible so far in life cycle assessment. When accounting for natural resources while occupying one of these systems, it is important to consider the primary resources that are actually deprived from nature, which differs between the natural and human-made marine systems.In natural systems, the extracted biomass was accounted for through its exergy content, which is the maximum quantity of work that the system can execute in its environment. Reference flows for marine fish, seaweeds, crustaceans and mollusks were proposed and their correlated CF was calculated. For human-made systems, the deprived land resource is, in fact, the occupied area of the marine surface. Based on potential marine net primary production data (NPP), exergy based spatial and temporal CFs for ocean areal occupation were calculated. This approach was included in the Cumulative Exergy Extraction from the Natural Environment (CEENE) method which makes it the first life cycle impact assessment (LCIA) method capable of analyzing the environmental impact (and more specific the resource footprint) of marine areal occupation. Furthermore, the methodology was applied to two case studies: comparing resource consumption of on- and offshore oil production, and fish and soybean meal production for fish feed applications.

Both surveys are standardized to account for the unbalanced design of the sampling procedure. The first survey is effectively a census of the number of goliath grouper at five artificial reef sites in the Gulf of Mexico about 90 miles north of Key West, Florida. It is standardized by use of the canonical log-linear model. The second survey includes the observations of many different SCUBA divers at 32 sites scattered along the Atlantic coast of Florida from the Dry Tortugas to Jupiter. The canonical log-linear model is not appropriate for standardizing this data set because observations of 2-10 fish are recorded only as two or more. To accommodate this feature, we developed a standardization procedure based on a censored Poisson distribution. The most important factors in standardizing the two surveys were the year and location. Seasonal effects were also statistically significant but had little effect on the results because most of the dives in any given year were conducted during the warm season.

I intend to conduct research which will assist in the drive to create underwater vehicles that can manoeuvre and operate in daunting environments where current technologies do not yet have the capabilities of successfully venturing, allowing maintenance to be carried out in a broader spectrum of conditions. With operations in offshore deep sea oil and gas extraction particularly becoming more complex, the need for automated vehicles for maintenance and inspection is growing substantially. My aim will be to develop new or adapt current technologies that can manage and counteract the disturbances the vehicle will see in the unpredictable subsea environment, therefore reducing the limitations of operations that current Remotely Operated Vehicles (ROV's) and Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUV's) are subject to. The capabilities of modern ROV's and AUV's are very much dependent on weather conditions; this is the problem I intend to tackle with my research and make substantial progress in developing solutions to widen the conditions these vehicles are capable of tackling. Approaches to the challenge could involve possibly adapting current integrated circuit designs for custom use, which could speed up the processing of information and possibly advance the predictive ability of the system; this would allow the vehicle to counteract disturbances more effectively. A mechanical based approach would be to obstruct the movement of the vehicle through restraints, allowing maintenance/inspection to be conducted with minimal disturbances in reference to position. Another control-based approach may involve sensing disturbances before they occur, by being able to predict accurately how the vehicle would be affected; this would be more complex as the sea is a naturally chaotic environment but using a combination of advanced sensors and machine learning it then a much more possible solution. This research is critical if the industry is to transition to fully automated inspection and maintenance of offshore technologies, which implies the reduction of cost of maintenance in the long term thus also implying lower cost per watt of energy produced; the need to place humans in extremely dangerous positions would also be removed therefore improving the safety of such operations.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,2274493,,,,,,,,University of Edinburgh,,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:15313751,,

These sediments were deposited in an actively subsiding basin (Indus Basin), formed after the India-Asia collision, developed over forearc and related basins. The Indus Basin represents a narrow embayment occupied by a relict shallow sea with prominent tidal energy. It received sediments from the north (Ladakh Batholith and Karakoram block) as well as the south (Indian continental margin and Suture zone deposits). During its deposition, tectonic pulses in the north as well as the south contributed coarse sediments in the form of conglomerates. The deposition in the basin took place in a tidal flat and sand-shoal complexes under the influence of moderate tidal energy and weak wave energy. In the areas of point sources in the basin, alluvial fans built braid plains extending into the basin. The basin closed in the east due to collision of Indian and Myanmarese (Burmese) plates; however, in the west it was open, connected to a diminishing Neotethys Ocean. In Pakistan, marine influences are prominent. The Indus Basin received huge amounts of freshwater and detritus from landmasses in the north and the south. Most of the fossil records in the Indus Group are freshwater plants, land vertebrates, freshwater molluscs and ostracods from the conglomerate deposits of the braid plain. The age of the Indus Group sediments is estimated to be from 41 Ma to 20 Ma, though no precicise biostratigraphic and chronostratigraphic control is available. Inversion of basin resulted in upliftment of sediment over the Ladakh Batholith around 20 Ma. Deposition in the Indus Group is almost contemporary with the deposition of the Sirmur Group (particularly the Dagsai-Kasauli formations) of the Lesser Himalaya. It is postulated that deposition in both the areas was controlled by same geotectonic processes of the Himalaya.",,,,,,,,,13,0,0,0,5,0,16,,,0552-9360,,,,,,,,,,,"CSIR Cent Bldg Res Inst, Roorkee, Uttar Pradesh, IndiaKumaun Univ, Dept Geol, Naini Tal, IndiaWadia Inst Himalayan Geol, Dehra Dun 248001, Uttar Pradesh, IndiaUniv Jammu, Dept Geol, Jammu 180004, IndiaUniv Lucknow, Ctr Adv Study Geol, Lucknow 226007, Uttar Pradesh, IndiaOil & Nat Gas Corp, Keshava Deva Malviya Inst Petr Explorat, Dehra Dun, Uttar Pradesh, IndiaBirbal Sahni Inst Paleobot, Lucknow 226007, Uttar Pradesh, India",,,,2016-02-03,WOS:000368209400012,,

For ultra-deep waters offshore activities like the ones being developed at the Brazilian pre-salt basin, located 200 km away from the coast in waters with 2,000 m depth, mature alternatives as the power from shore pose a significant engineering challenge. One alternative that can avoid weight and space restrictions on the offshore environment is the power hub. A power hub consists of a more efficient central power plant to feed partially or in total a number of offshore platforms.

Such an assessment relies on data collected on the various items over the lifecycle of an engineering asset. Considering that offshore platforms have a design life of about 25 years and data management techniques and tools are constantly evolving, data captured about items to be decommissioned will be in varying forms. In addition, considering the many stakeholders involved with a facility over its lifecycle, information representation of the items will have variations. These challenges make data integration difficult. As a result, this research developed a data integration framework that makes use of Semantic Web technologies and ISO 15926 - a standard for process plant data integration - for rapid assessment of decommissioned items.

To place the results of the toxicity testing into the context of environmental risk, the spatial extent of potential biological effects was investigated using the CORMIX mixing zone model. The output of the modeling indicated that discharge of selected effluents did not result in concentrations, or duration of exposure, that would elicit toxic effects to organisms living in the surrounding environment.

This innovative approach has the advantage of linking physical oceanography with engineering problems. The results indicate that the theoretical annual tidal energy resources is about 2x10(8) kWh under the influence of tidal power station; Optimized power installation is confirmed according to power generation curve from numerical analysis; the developable resources is about 38.2% of theoretical tidal energy resources with the employment of one-way electricity generation.

However, these ecosystems are under an increasing array of threats, both in the UK and worldwide, especially from a wide range of new and emerging chemical stressors (e.g. novel antibiotics and pesticides). Freshwater biosciences and applied ecology are under-equipped for dealing with these new threats: the evidence base is lacking, there is often little or no mechanistic understanding, or predictive capacity for anticipating how these novel chemicals will operate in the real world. This is particularly true for the ecosystems of the future that are being reshaped and constructed by climate and other environmental changes. Our project will address all these shortcomings by taken a radically different approach from the classical biomonitoring and ecotoxicology tools that have dominated for many decades. We aim to unearth the general rules by which emerging chemical stressors operate through, and alter, networks of interacting species - from microbes at the base of the food web, through to apex predators in the fish community at the top. This will involve the development of indicators of both proximate pollution, as the chemical first enters the biological system (commonly as a new food source for microbes), and also of its indirect effects as its impact propagates through the food web. For instance, we will be able to answer questions such as: if a new insecticide wipes out the invertebrates in the middle of the food web, does this trigger blooms of nuisance algae as they are no longer kept in check? To achieve this, we will develop a new suite of methods at the ecosystem level that combine lab and field experiments to detect the causal mechanisms that we currently do not understand.

Unlike traditional marine living resources, genetic resources are not exploited for their properties as physical substances, but as sources of information. The current international regulatory regime governing access to marine genetic resources is the traditional rule of capture, which provides that ownership of natural resources coming from a common source of supply is recognized once it has been reduced to dominion and control. This contribution contends that the rule of capture coupled with exclusive access agreements and strong global intellectual property protections create a legal environment that is inequitable, economically and biologically inefficient, and ripe for international discord.

As for Hong Kong, one of the most densely populated cities, the shortage of indigenous fossil sources has inevitably resulted in excessive dependence on external energy sources. Nevertheless, in consideration of the reduction of fossil fuel reserves, as well as the impact on the environment of fossil fuel uses, the exploration of usable renewable energy sources becomes increasingly important for Hong Kong's long-term development. Based on 6-year wind observations from three meteorological stations at three islands in Hong Kong, this study provides a statistical assessment of the wind characteristics and wind energy potential at offshore locations surrounding Hong Kong. The Weibull distribution function was applied to estimate the Weibull parameters which can be used to facilitate the evaluation of offshore wind energy potential. The variation of the mean wind speed, the Weibull parameters and the wind power density were established under various timescales. Significant yearly, seasonal and monthly variations of the Weibull parameters were observed, while the diurnal variation was relatively small. The veracity of the Weibull distribution model to represent offshore wind data was examined, and it was shown that the Weibull model gave an adequate description of the frequencies of actual wind data. Finally, the total wind power capacities at the three potential offshore wind farm locations were derived, which indicated that the Southeastern waters are the most promising locations for offshore wind farm development in Hong Kong.

Here we evaluated seven common revegetation techniques by considering both deep soil moisture deficit and soil organic carbon (SOC) sequestration on the Loess Plateau of China, attempting to identify a suitable method for soil restoration of severely degraded ecosystems. The seven revegetation techniques considered were: two single-species shrub plantations (Caragana korshinskii and Hippophae rhamnoides), two single species tree plantations (Platycladus orientalis with terracing and Robinia pseudoacacia), and three mixed plantations (P. orientalis/H. rhamnoides with terracing, R. pseudoacacia/H. rhamnoides, R. pseudoacacia/P. orientalis). A 12-year-old abandoned cropland served as the control. The results showed that the single-species plantation of P. orientalis with terracing had the lowest soil moisture deficit in deep layers (200-800 cm) but also had the lowest SOC sequestration. In contrast, the mixed plantation of R. pseudoacacia/H. rhamnoides had the highest SOC sequestration but also had significant deep soil moisture deficit. In contrast, the mixed plantation of P. orientalis/H. rhamnoides with terracing showed near-zero deep soil moisture deficit and significant, positive SOC sequestration. Therefore, this mixed plantation was identified as representing a suitable revegetation technique for this region. The results here suggest that appropriate mixed tree/shrub plantations with appropriate land engineering measures could deliver effective soil restoration in such environments. Our results provide an insight into revegetation in areas with degraded land.",,,,,,,,,99,18,0,0,69,0,114,,,0016-7061,1872-6259,,,,,,,,,,"Northwest A&F Univ, Inst Soil & Water Conservat, Yangling, Shaanxi, Peoples R ChinaChinese Acad Sci & Minist Water Resources, Inst Soil & Water Conservat, Yangling, Shaanxi, Peoples R ChinaNatl Engn Res Ctr Water Saving Irrigat Yangling, Yangling, Shaanxi, Peoples R ChinaBur Agr Yanchuan Cty, Yanan, Shaanxi, Peoples R China",Natl Engn Res Ctr Water Saving Irrigat YanglingBur Agr Yanchuan Cty,,,2018-12-28,WOS:000426224800007,,

Traditionally, Subject Matter Engineers (SMEs) perform qualitative RBI and so the procedure is vulnerable to human biases and errors. Unreliability also causes due to the performer-to-performer output variation. Mechanization of the QRBI process improves the quality of the analysis by reducing the effects of human biases, enhancing the accuracy and speed of the calculations and increasing the repeatability.

However, a complete geomechanics study is limited with the number of experts, time consuming and not a straightforward task. Therefore, there is an urgent need of a quick geomechanics screening criterion to be used as a standard guideline to evaluate the high level geomechanical risks and suitable analysis can be recommended for the identified development fields. The aim of this paper is to propose a screening criterion for geomechanical risks study based on four key parameters, drilling, depletion, injection and storage and sand production. The screening approach is designed based on Risk Assessment Matrix (RAM) risk screening where the likelihood is based on a set of scores developed to specific questions. The consequence for each failure scenarios is assessed based on educated estimation of the impact towards people, asset, environment and reputation. Recommendations for geomechanical study are made based on the severity of each failure category on the RAM risk matrix. Fourteen development fields in offshore Peninsular Malaysia, offshore Sarawak and offshore Sabah are selected for the assessment. Based on results, fields in offshore Sarawak and Sabah have higher potential for geomechacnical issues mainly because of their geological settings and formation characteristics.

Integration and comparison of the results using all these methods is presented given some practical applications for indirect near-surface and seafloor interpretations. Ten different echo types were identified and grouped into four main classes: I) distinct; II) indistinct; III) irregular and IV) hyperbolic. Echo-character distribution enabled us to determine recent sedimentary processes in the area. Two major depositional systems can be found through the identification of these sedimentary processes: a) a slope depositional system (SDS) located in the eastern and central area, where mass-movement processes are dominant and b) a turbiditic Main Channel depositional system (TDS) located in the western area where channel-related processes are dominant. Both of these interact over the half-graben structure of the southwestern sector of the Galicia Bank, where the Prestige wreck is located. Within the SDS, erosive and depositional mass-movement processes characterised a complex depositional system. Erosive processes occur on the fault scarp, channels head, inter-lobe channels and distal part of the sedimentary lobes. Moreover, depositional processes take place on the top of the fault scarp, sedimentary wedges, sedimentary lobes, and on the west flank of the Main Channel. Both depositional systems interact, but the SDS should be more active during fault-scarp reactivation periods, through relief rejuvenation and new exposed deposits. Microearthquake activity would favour the available materials, being weathered, eroded and transported by mass-movements. In such a situation, the TDS acts as the main collector of eroded sediment derived from the fault scarp throughout the SDS being responsible for its evacuation into the Iberian Abyssal Plain. However, outside of fault reactivation periods, the SDS is less active (such as during the present situation). (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

(Ref: OMAE2017-61494 Development and Testing of a Friction-Based Post-Installable Sensor for Subsea Fiber Optic Monitoring Systems [1]). The prototype fiber-optic monitoring system collects a wide range of real-time data, which can be used to determine structural loading, fatigue, temperature, pressure, and flow assurance on operational platforms.The primary challenge of a post-installed instrumentation monitoring system is to ensure secure coupling between the sensors and the structure of interest for reliable measurements. Friction-based coupling devices have the potential to overcome installation challenges caused by marine growth and soil contamination on subsea structures, flowlines, or risers. This particular design solution is compatible with structures that are suspended in the water column and those that are resting on the seabed. In addition, the system can be installed by commercial divers in shallow depths or by remotely operated vehicles in deep-water applications.Operational limitations of the initial design concept were identified in the previous series of tests (2016-2017), and several innovative enhancements have been implemented which resulted in significant improvements in sensor system coupling and strain measurement correlation with traditional strain measuring devices. This paper provides a summary of the notable prototype design changes, full-scale test article buildup, and detailed performance data recorded during tension and compression loading that simulated representative offshore conditions. The test results were positive and demonstrated the effectiveness of the design enhancements. Compromises made during mounting of the sensing elements resulted in better performance in tension than compression. These effects are well understood and are fully discussed, and do not influence the viability of the design changes.This study is part of a continuing collaboration between the Houston-based NASA-Johnson Space Center and Astro Technology, Inc. within a study called Clear Gulf. The primary objective of the Clear Gulf study is to develop advanced instrumentation technologies that will improve operational safety and reduce the risk of hydrocarbon spillage.

This study reviews the literature on human dimensions of MHK energies to explore gaps and challenges to be tackled in future research. While peer-reviewed literature on the human dimensions of MHK energies is growing, it is dominated by studies in developed high income countries. Research on human dimensions of MHK energies has focused on public perceptions and social acceptability, public conflicts, stakeholder participation and community cost and benefits. Three methodologies dominated the analysis of data: qualitative approaches, descriptive and inference statistics and mapping tools. Empirical studies performed in sites where MHK energy projects are planned or ongoing were scarce. Given that a great deal of MHK energy projects are occurring globally in developed and developing countries, the research gaps we identified present a number of risks.

Although density and diversity were severely impacted by the spill initially, total meiofauna, nematodes, copepods, and annelids, excluding the polychaete Manayunkia aestuarina, recovered in about 3 years in near synchrony with Spartina alterniflora stem density. However other common taxa either recovered more slowly (i.e., juvenile bivalves and amphipods) or remained significantly lower in density at oiled compared to reference sites 6 years after the spill. Specifically, M. aestuarina, the tanaid Hargeria rapax, the kinorhynch Echinoderes coulli, ostracods, and juvenile gastropods did not recover at the heavily oiled sites, and M. aestuarina and E. coulli failed to recover at moderately oiled sites. Several factors possibly contributed to slow recovery even after the re-establishment of aboveground vegetation. The concentration of petroleum hydrocarbons (TPH) remained elevated at moderately and heavily oil sites, and the direct toxic effects of oil may have been long lasting for intolerant fauna; the densities of E. coulli and M. aestuarina across all samples were inversely correlated with TPH. In addition, several of the slowly recovering taxa also disperse slowly. Finally, live belowground biomass of roots and rhizomes (a key indicator of sediment quality) remained significantly reduced at heavily and moderately oiled sites, and belowground biomass and the densities of M. aestuarina and juvenile gastropods were positively correlated. We conclude that the factors controlling the rate and intensity of infaunal recovery from the DHOS differed among taxa and over time. The factors that were important later in the recovery process were not dissimilar to those affecting succession following marsh restoration by planting S. altemiflora, and the legacy of oiling from the spill did not greatly slow the recovery of infauna compared to that observed in restored wetlands. At current rates, full recovery of the infaunal community will require about a decade at moderately oiled and longer at heavily oiled sites. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

At the Last Glacial Maximum, Dogger Bank, in the southern North Sea, was covered by the Eurasian Ice Sheet. However, the maximum extent and behavior of the ice sheet in the North Sea basin is poorly constrained. We reveal ice-marginal dynamics and maximum ice extent at Dogger Bank through sedimentological and stratigraphic investigation of glacial and proglacial lake sediments. We use a large, integrated subsurface dataset of shallow seismic reflection and geotechnical data collected during windfarm site investigation. For the first time, an ice stream is identified at Dogger Bank, based on preserved subglacial bedforms, eskers and meltwater channels. During ice-sheet advance, a terminal thrust-block moraine complex formed, whose crest runs approximately north-northeast to south-southwest. Subsequent ice stream shutdown caused stagnation of ice, and rapid retreat of the ice-sheet margin. The moraine complex, and outwash head from an adjacent ice-sheet lobe to the west, dammed a large (approximately 750 km(2)) proglacial lake. Subsequent sedimentation infilled the lake with 30 m of glacial outwash sed iments. A lobate subaqueous fan formed at the ice-sheet margin, which thins toward the southeast with iceberg scours and ice-rafted debris at the base, and is onlapped by lake sediments calibrated to core as alternating clay and silt laminae, interpreted to be varves. The lake became isolated from the retreating ice-sheet margin, and ice-sheet retreat slowed. Sediment-laden meltwater was supplied to the ice-distal proglacial lake for c. 1500-2000 years. Subsequent ice-sheet retreat off Dogger Bank was more rapid due to the negative subglacial slope. The stepped retreat of rapid downwasting, slow retreat, and a final rapid phase off Dogger Bank occurred after the LGM at around 27 ka and before formation of a ribbon lake, dated previously to 23 ka and approximately 60 m lower in elevation, formed to the north of Dogger Bank.

The Southern Ocean is a vast and variable environment with a potentially large role in global carbon cycling. The JGOFS Southern Ocean Program seeks to advance the understanding of this region by investigating seasonal and spatial dynamics in two important subsystems -- the Ross Sea shelf and the Antarctic Polar Front Zone. This project will contribute to this effort by determining microbial community structure and by assessing rates of phytoplankton growth and microzooplankton grazing on four cruises covering the spring, summer, and autumn seasons in the open-ocean frontal zone. The overall goal of this research is to understand how physical processes (advection, mixing, and light), iron-limitation, and grazing interact to determine plankton community structure and production in the open oceans. Population abundances and biomasses of the plankton community will be assessed by analytical flow cytometry (bacteria and phytoplankton) and microscopy (nano- and microplankton) to determine their temporal and spatial patterns relative to physical features of the polar front. Growth rates of phytoplankton and bacteria, and microzooplankton herbivory and bacterivory will be measured with a suite of complementary methods including dilution, fluorescently labeled prey, size fractionation, and a Iysozme assay for bacterivory. Results of this project will contribute to the general understanding of phytoplankton control mechanisms and trophic interactions in high-nutrient, low-chlorophyll regions of the world's ocea ns. They will also help to identify how potential global change affects water-column stability and how physical forcing in the Southern Ocean may alter food web structure, carbon storage and export from the euphotic zone.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,9634053,,,,,,,,University of Hawaii,,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:13825977,,

The lowermost formation deposited in Eocene time was assigned as a source rock, for which a mixed kerogen of type II and III was input in the modeling of oil and gas generation in consideration of the sedimentary environment of fluvio-lacustrine condition. Initial TOC was 4% as an input, based on the analysis of the well data and sedimentary environment. The modeling results show that a considerable amount of hydrocarbons was generated and expelled from the source rocks at the western Joint Development Zone (JDZ) sub-block 4, where the hydrocarbons was migrated to the above reservoir rocks at 20 Ma. The oil and gas in the reservoir rocks of the JDZ sub-block 4 are accumulated into the prospects with closure structures that has already been formed at the nearby areas. Another generation of hydrocarbon occurs from the source rock at the eastern border area of JDZ sub-block 1 and 2, where the expulsion of the hydrocarbons occurs at 10 Ma from the source rock into the above reservoir rocks, in which the accumulation also is expected. The generation, migration and accumulation were retarded at the eastern area of the JDZ sub-block 1 and 2, compared with the area of the western JDZ sub-block 4. Based on the modeling results, it is estimated that gases migrated laterally and vertically in long distance whereas oil migrated laterally in shorter distance than gases. A substantial amount of hydrocarbon could have seeped out of the reservoir formations to the surface since the migration of oil and gas actively occurred in Miocene time before the formation of seals.

Comparison of pre- and post-construction tidal flow models indicates that in general tidal currents have increased considerably in front of the Daeho tidal flat, with tidal flow directions having changed from shore-normal to shore-parallel. The 12-h measurements of currents and suspended sediment concentrations at four anchored hydrographic stations show nearshore suspended sediments drifting southward throughout the year, bypassing the Daeho tidal flat. Cyclic seasonal variations occur prominently in the grain texture of the tidal-flat sediments and associated sedimentation rates. In summer, fine-grained sediments deposit at a rate of 2-6 mm/month, particularly in sheltered places. During the winter monsoon, erosional processes are,greatly enhanced by the interplay of tidal currents and waves (up to -30 mm/month). This sedimentary seasonality is reflected in the variations in the concentration of nearshore suspended matter. The concentration of suspended matter is much higher in winter (60-80 mg/l), because of vigorous resuspension activities, compared with the summer concentration (10-30 mg/l). The direct effect of seawall construction, coupled with strong natural seasonality, can be seen from the continuous monitoring of sedimentation rates on the tidal flat. The 2-year (1993-1995) measurements indicate that the entire Daeho tidal flat was eroded during that period at the abnormally high average rate of -10 cm/year. The causal blocking of bayward sediment and water movements by any artificial structure might lead to similar erosional conditions to many other bays facing the Yellow Sea, on the both Chinese and Korean coastlines subjected to energetic winter-wave attack.

The coastal peat swamp forests of Sarawak, Malaysian Borneo, are undergoing rapid conversion, predominantly into oil palm plantations. This wetland ecosystem is assumed to have experienced insignificant disturbance in the past, persisting under a single ecologically-stable regime. However, there is limited knowledge of the past disturbance regime, long-term functioning and fundamentally the resilience of this ecosystem to changing natural and anthropogenic perturbations through time.2. In this study, long-term ecological data sets from three degraded peatlands in Sarawak were collected to shed light on peat swamp forest dynamics. Fossil pollen and charcoal were counted in each sedimentary sequence to reconstruct vegetation and investigate responses to past environmental disturbance, both natural and anthropogenic.3. Results demonstrate that peat swamp forest taxa have dominated these vegetation profiles throughout the last c. 2000-year period despite the presence of various drivers of disturbance. Evidence for episodes of climatic variability, predominantly linked to ENSO events, and wildfires is present throughout. However, in the last c. 500 years, burning and indicators of human disturbance have elevated beyond past levels at these sites, concurrent with a reduction in peat swamp forest pollen.4. Two key insights have been gained through this palaeoecological analysis: (i) peat swamp forest vegetation has demonstrated resilience to disturbance caused by burning and climatic variability in Sarawak in the late Holocene, however (ii) coincident with increased fire combined with human impact c. 500 years ago, these communities started to decline.5. Synthesis. Sarawak's coastal peat swamps have demonstrated resilience to past natural disturbances, with forest vegetation persisting through episodes of fire and climatic variability. However, palaeoecological data presented here suggest that recent, anthropogenic disturbances are of a greater magnitude, causing the observed decline in the peat swamp forest communities in the last c. 500 years and challenging the ecosystem's persistence. This study greatly extends our knowledge of the ecological functioning of these understudied ecosystems, providing baseline information on the past vegetation and its response to disturbance. This understanding is central to developing management strategies that foster resilience in the remaining peat swamp forests and ensure continued provision of services, namely carbon storage, from this globally important ecosystem.",,,,,,,,,50,1,0,0,36,0,58,,,0022-0477,1365-2745,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Oxford, Dept Zool, Oxford Long Term Ecol Lab, Oxford OX1 3PS, EnglandUniv Oxford, Dept Zool, Oxford Martin Sch, Biodivers Inst, Oxford OX1 3PS, EnglandOpen Univ, Fac Social Sci, Dept Geog, Milton Keynes MK7 6AA, Bucks, EnglandUniv Bergen, Dept Biol, N-5020 Bergen, NorwayRoyal Bot Gardens, Richmond TW9 3AB, Surrey, England",,,,2015-01-01,WOS:000350547200003,26120202,

Their sustainable management is crucial. Owing to the complexity of savanna vegetation dynamics, climate change and land use impacts on savannas are highly uncertain. We used a dynamic vegetation model, the adaptive dynamic global vegetation model (aDGVM), to project how climate change and fire management might influence future vegetation in northern Australian savannas. Under future climate conditions, vegetation can store more carbon than under ambient conditions. Changes in rainfall seasonality influence future carbon storage but do not turn vegetation into a carbon source, suggesting that CO2 fertilization is the main driver of vegetation change. The application of prescribed fires with varying return intervals and burning season influences vegetation and fire impacts. Carbon sequestration is maximized with early dry season fires and long fire return intervals, while grass productivity is maximized with late dry season fires and intermediate fire return intervals. The study has implications for management policy across Australian savannas because it identifies how fire management strategies may influence grazing yield, carbon sequestration and greenhouse gas emissions.

The effect of this increased exchange on terrestrial carbon storage is less predictable, with important implications for potential feedbacks to the climate system. We quantified how increased mean annual temperature (MAT) affects ecosystem carbon storage in above-and belowground live biomass and detritus across a well-constrained 5.2 degrees C MAT gradient in tropical montane wet forests on the Island of Hawaii. This gradient does not systematically vary in biotic or abiotic factors other than MAT (i.e. dominant vegetation, substrate type and age, soil water balance, and disturbance history), allowing us to isolate the impact of MAT on ecosystem carbon storage. Live biomass carbon did not vary predictably as a function of MAT, while detrital carbon declined by similar to 14 Mg of carbon ha(-1) for each 1 degrees C rise in temperature - a trend driven entirely by coarse woody debris and litter. The largest detrital pool, soil organic carbon, was the most stable with MAT and averaged 48% of total ecosystem carbon across the MAT gradient. Total ecosystem carbon did not vary significantly with MAT, and the distribution of ecosystem carbon between live biomass and detritus remained relatively constant across the MAT gradient at similar to 44% and similar to 56%, respectively. These findings suggest that in the absence of alterations to precipitation or disturbance regimes, the size and distribution of carbon pools in tropical montane wet forests will be less sensitive to rising MAT than predicted by ecosystem models.

The definition includes also the territorial sea of 12 nautical miles. Coastal management is conducted by a national plan legally enforced, complemented by states and counties plans, and a coastal ecologic-economic zoning limited to small portions of the coastal zone. A resolution of the Environmental National Council defines as permanent preservation areas, of very restricted use, coastal ecosystems as mangroves, sand dunes, and reproduction sites of wild fauna. One could expect that the Brazilian coast should be more protected and properly managed than other countries where a national management plan is lacking (Argentina) or where the guidelines exist but are not yet legally enforced (South Africa). Notwithstanding. we note today in Brazil an intensification of conflicts opposing small-scale vs. industrial fishermen; shrimp farming vs. mangrove crab harvesting; resorts installation vs. native communities; oil and gas activities vs. NGOs: and conflicts on environmental permit between federal and state governmental agencies.

The Sharon coastal ridge consists of alternating layers of kurkar (local term for aeolian carbonate-cemented, quartz sandstone) and poorly consolidated palaeosol deposits. The ridge was formed during the Late Pleistocene (about 70,000 to 10,000 yr. BP). At about 7,500 yr. BP, sea level reached the western edge of the present coastal ridge, currently located about 8 m below the present sea level, and a coastal cliff developed. Since then the cliff has continuously been eroded and retreated eastward by natural processes, as well as by anthropogenic impact. This article is an interdisciplinary geo-archaeological study of the extent and rates of retreat of the coastal cliff over the last 7,500 years. The findings suggest that overall the cliff has retreated about 730 m in this period, at an average rate of 9.7 cm/yr. However, the study shows that a considerably higher rate of cliff retreat occurred between about 7,500 and 3,900 yr. BP (about 650 m in about 3,600 years, at about 18 cm/yr). Sea level reached its present level at about 4,000 yr. BP (Middle Bronze Age) and has not changed significantly since.

Increasing dispersant dosage linearly enhanced solubility for all PAHs. Conversely, the dispersant enhanced the sediment uptake of the PAHs, and induced significant desorption hysteresis. Such contrasting effects (adsolubilization vs. solubilization) of dispersant were found dependent of the dispersant concentration and PAH hydrophobicity. The dual-mode models adequately simulated the sorption kinetics and isotherms, and quantified dispersant-enhanced PAH uptake. Sorption of naphthalene and 1-methylnaphthalene by sediment positively correlated with uptake of the dispersant, while sorption of pyrene dropped sharply when the dispersant exceeded its critical micelle concentration (CMC). The deepwater conditions diminished the dispersant effects on solubilization, but enhanced uptake of the PAHs, albeit sorption of the dispersant was lowered. The information may aid in understanding roles of dispersants on distribution, fate and transport of petroleum PAHs in marine systems. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

The obtained WPS results are presented on an X65 Steel pipe grade, 273.1 mm OD and 25.4 mm WT.",,,,,"35th ASME International Conference on Ocean, Offshore and Arctic Engineering35th ASME International Conference on Ocean, Offshore and Arctic Engineering","JUN 19-24, 2016JUN 19-24, 2016","ASME, Ocean Offshore & Arctic Engn DivASME, Ocean Offshore & Arctic Engn Div","Busan, SOUTH KOREABusan, SOUTH KOREA",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,978-0-7918-4995-8,,,,,,,,,"TenarisTamsa R&D, Veracruz, Ver, MexicoTenarisDalmine, Dalmine, BG, Italy",TenarisTamsa R&DTenarisDalmine,,,2017-03-01,WOS:000393090700012,,

A two-dimensional analysis (dispersant concentration and duration of exposure) was conducted by pre-incubation of a salt marsh sediment under an open or closed condition. Denitrification activity was characterized by N2O production using an acetylene (C2H2) blockage technique, and organic matter (OM) mineralization by CO2 production. The results show that even trace amount of the dispersant could significantly inhibit the denitrification activity by 20% (p <0.05). However, the sediment was resilient to the oil/dispersant contamination, likely due to shift of its microbial communities, by recovering the denitrification activity within 46 days in the open incubation. Inhibitory effect of the oil/dispersant on denitrification persisted beyond 46 days in the closed incubation, and the recovery could take up to 137 days depending on the dispersant concentration. The dispersant continuously stimulated OM mineralization that lowered the sediment redox status. Mobilization of N in the sediment from the OM mineralization forms a positive feedback loop, leading to deterioration of the coastal ecosystem. The study concludes that minimum dispersant should be applied for oil spill remediation, and oil cleanup operations should avoid moving the oil/dispersant from surface into deeper layers of the sediment. Synergistic interactions between the crude oil and dispersant and their biodegradation products deserves future examinations. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

J,,,,,,,,,,,An improved installation technique for offshore wind: Replacing grouted foundation connections with a mechanical alternative,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Awarded Grant,Jan 01 2020,2020,"Cedeco Contractors Ltd are conducting a feasibility study for an improved installation technique for offshore wind. The company is proposing to replace grout with a mechanical alternative as a means of securing the jacket foundation of an offshore turbine to the seabed; if successful, this will represent a step change in foundation installation techniques.Over the past forty years grout has been the go-to method for securing offshore foundations; it's a proven technique within offshore oil and gas. However its application in offshore wind is presenting new challenges particularly in relation to the time taken and costs involved.In summer of 2018 a leading wind developer in partnership with the Offshore Renewable Energy Catapult (OREC) launched an innovation challenge looking for ways to reduce the cost of the grouting process. Cedeco's proposed approach won that challenge.But before developing a full scale prototype for testing, the company is continuing to develop its value proposition by conducting an initial feasibility study and examining market need.Together with the wind developer, a global engineering firm and research partner (OREC) Cedeco is going to develop, model and test its technology. It's aiming to achieve a level of pre-certification from the industry standards bodies (for example, DNV GL) before progressing to prototype development and testing. At the same time the company is planning to conduct market research within the wider community of offshore wind developers; testing its value proposition with these end users to ensure it fully meets their needs, and indeed, to ensure there is a wider end user need that needs satisfying.Fabricating, testing and certifying a prototype of this innovative technology will require a significant level of investment (£1-2m) over a sustained period of 2-3 years. The aim of this feasibility study is to provide evidence of the technology's prospects for success and to support future investment decisions regarding a subsequent and larger project of developing and testing a prototype.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,105716,,,,,,,,Cedeco Contractors Limited,Cedeco Contractors Limited,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:15411050,,

The results showed that the mass of OPAs and oil-particle aggregation rate are mainly related to the sediment concentration. Under the same mass concentration, more oil droplets can be trapped by smaller particles. Nevertheless, larger particles tend to interact more quickly with oil droplets. The effect of temperature on the formation of OPAs is substantially attributed to its influence on oil viscosity, and there is a threshold for oil viscosity which will bring about the maximum OPAs. Spilled oil with a high asphaltene can interact more effectively with the sediments.

A study of 13 short cores recovered with a manned submersible from these seepage-affected sediments reveals that microbial processes fueled by hydrocarbons cause extensive sulfur diagenesis. Sulfate reduction and sulfide release occurring in the pore fluids reach completion 10-25 cm below the sediment-water interface. Bacterial sulfate reduction (BSR) rates are highly variable between sites but maximum values (97 and 917 mumol SO4 cm(-3) year 1) in a bacterial mat and mussel bed, respectively, are unusually high for cold, deepwater habitats. delta(34)S and delta(18)O values of the residual sulfate range from 20.7 parts per thousand to 70.8 parts per thousand (CDT) (n = 45) and from 11.1 parts per thousand to 23.6 parts per thousand (SMOW) (n = 33) compared to the overlying Gulf of Mexico bottom water values of 20.3 parts per thousand and 9.7 parts per thousand, respectively. 6 34S values of H2S yield a mean of 12.4 +/- 5.4 parts per thousand (CDT) (n = 15). delta(34)S (SO4) data yield an integrated fractionation factor of alpha(S) = 1.015 under a closed system assumption but a substantial higher fractionation of alpha(S) = 1.023 under an open system assumption. Paired SO4-H2S inventory indicates that up to 28% of sulfide is removed from the system and supports the contention that seep sediments constitute an open system. The sulfur isotope fractionations reported here compare well with experimental data for cold-adapted sulfate-reducing bacteria but are substantially smaller than the geological fractionation of alpha(S) = 1.055 derived from coeval sulfate-sulfide in Phanerozoic sediments. Isotope enrichments in the SO4 are 2.4 times greater in delta(34)S than in delta(18)O and the relations documented with f(SO4) are indicative of mixing between two end-member sulfate sources; seawater sulfate cycled through microbial dissimilatory sulfate reduction at depth and secondary sulfate produced by oxidation of H2S at near-surface through bacterial disproportionation (BDS) processes. The evidence for superimposed metabolic reactions in the reducing and oxidative parts of the anaerobic sulfur cycle in seep sediments has important implications regarding the proposed use of pore-water sulfate profiles as proxies of upward methane fluxes resulting from dissociation of marine-based gas hydrates.

J,,,,,,,,,"Ryabchuk,Daria",,Geoenvironmental conditions of marine natural management in the Russian sector of the South-Eastern Baltic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Awarded Grant,Jan 01 1800,2014,"The modern features of ecological functions and environmental properties is a joint product of its natural evolution and technogenesis. That last factor - technogenesis - has caused the transformation of many ecosystems (mainly, in the negative direction) and the occurrence of complex system including the natural and technogenic systems. Determination of the natural background (or climate component of the environmental condition, whether it is the transformation of the bottom topography, precipitations, coasts, pollution of the water layer and the surface layer of the atmosphere) is the priority scientific problem, since only knowledge of natural background allows for determining the criteria which help to monitor the effect of the human impact. The project aims at solving a problem of ecological security of the Baltic Sea under conditions of real risks and threats connected with a growing level of anthropogenic impact on environment. The main environmental problem of the Baltic Sea is eutrophication, i.e. increase of the aquatic ecosystem trophicity due to excess income of the nutrient (biogenic) substances and biogeochemical imbalance. The Baltic Sea is surrounded by densely populated and economically developed countries, which makes a significant anthropogenic contribution to the enlargement of eutrophication. Amid growing the global hydrocarbon feedstock requirements, the problem of oil pollution of the marine environment is becoming increasingly important (Patin, 2001, 2009). The Baltic Sea is not exception. It is one of the most intensive traffic regions. Heavy Baltic traffic increases the anthropogenic environmental stress. Transportation of oil and other potentially dangerous goods is growing rapidly and consistently. Unfortunately, despite the strict legal prohibition, illegal dumping of oil-products in the Baltic Sea still continues. This oil-products are concentrated along the major shipping routes. Besides, shipwrecks occur sometimes in the seas, leading to oil spills. The urgency of the problem follows, in particular, from basic provisions of the Ecological Doctrine of the Russian Federation and the Sea Doctrine of the Russian Federation for the period till 2020. To solve the problems of rational use of marine resources and protection of coasts there is a need to improve management of use of natural sea and coastal resources based on proved and competitive models of development of not only a coastal zone, but also all water area of the Baltic Sea as a natural and technogenic system, monitoring of an ecological condition of the marine environment, and having the information on key parameters of its functioning. The ecological condition of the Baltic Sea for some reasons causes big alarm in the Baltic countries. In this regard the whole network of national laboratories and institutes carries out monitoring of various physical, chemical and biological parameters of the Baltic Sea. In many respects works on ecological safety of the Baltic Sea are co-ordinated by three intergovernmental organisations: The Helsinki Commission (HELCOM), the International Baltic Sea Fishery Commission (IBSFC) and the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES). The close attention from the national and international organisations which are responsible for environmental protection of the Baltic Sea, also causes necessity to create a complex system of information support of economic activity in the sea, meeting the requirements of these international organisations and including modern scientific technologies and the equipment. Now in the Kaliningrad region of the Russian Federation, unlike neighbouring states, necessary bases for introduction of modern approaches to integrated management of the marine environment has not created. The scientific novelty of the project objective resides in the problem that till present days the question of creation of land cadasters was put only for sea coasts. Active economic development of the Russian sector of the Southeast Baltic makes dissemination of ideology of coastal cadasters to the open sea demanded, and the serious background that the project performers have, combining with possibilities of the base organisation (the program development and the infrastructure of the Federal university) allows to solve the set objective. The specific objective of the project is to create a cadastre of the offshore zone of south-eastern part of the Baltic Sea. Cadastre is constantly updated, and specified (itemized) as required, classified data base of marine environment of the water area considered geographically, geologically, economically and sociologically. For the purposes of the project the new laboratory of Marine Natural Management will be created at IKBFU. The laboratory staff will include employees of the Department of Geography of the Ocean (IKBFU), as well as of the AB IO RAS, VSEGEI and Winogradsky Institute of Microbiology RAS. As a on-site stations the field station in the settlement Rybnoe (northern coast of Kaliningrad region; IKBFU property) and laboratory building №3 on the Vistula Spit (west coast of the Kaliningrad region; AB IO RAS property) will be used. In Marine expeditionary works AB IO RAS scientific fleet and small floating facilities will be used.

This increasing focus on capturing the energy from tidal currents has brought about the development of many designs for tidal current turbines. Several of these turbines are progressing rapidly from design to prototype and pre-commercial stages. As these systems near commercial development, it becomes increasingly important that their performance be validated through laboratory tests (e.g., towing tank tests) and sea tests.Several different turbine configurations have been tested recently. The test results show significant differences in turbine performance between laboratory tests, numerical simulations, and sea tests. Although the mean velocity of the current is highly predictable, evidence suggests a critical factor in these differences is the unsteady inflow. To understand the physics and the effect of the inflow on turbine performance and reliability, Verdant Power (Verdant) and the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) have engaged in a partnership to address the engineering challenges facing marine current turbines. As part of this effort, Verdant deployed Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler (ADCP) equipment to collect data from a kinetic hydropower system (KHPS) installation at the Roosevelt Island Tidal Energy (RITE) project in the East River in New York City. The ADCP collected data for a little more than one year, and this data is critical for properly defining the operating environment needed for marine systems.This paper summarizes the Verdant-NREL effort to study inflow data provided by the fixed, bottom-mounted ADCP instrumentation and how the data is processed using numerical tools. It briefly reviews previous marine turbine tests and inflow measurements, provides background information from the RITE project, and describes the test turbine design and instrumentation setup. This paper also provides an analysis of the measured time domain data and a detailed discussion of shear profiling, turbulence intensity, and time-dependent fluctuations of the inflow. The paper concludes with suggestions for future work.The analysis provided in this paper will benefit future turbine operation studies.

By providing multiple functions ASRs are often expected to contribute positively to the local economy, especially through tourism related to surfing and other water sports or beach uses. However, there is a lack of independent studies to support this expectation. This study investigates the claims that an ASR will enhance a coastal economy through tourism. Using Boscombe ASR, UK as a case study a preliminary evaluation of visitor expenditure is conducted. Using targeted face-to-face questionnaires we gathered data from 523 seafront visitors over a 32 month period. Results show that the ASR initially acted as a tourist attraction after which the novelty wore off. However, the positive impacts of the seafront regeneration scheme on the local economy are longer lasting. Contrary to the original claims that the Boscombe ASR would attract an affluent surf market, surfers and water users interviewed in this study are low spenders and rarely stayed overnight in Boscombe. Although it has been demonstrated that the expenditure of surfers is not as high as expected, more affluent non-surfer visitors have been attracted by the marketing associated with the new surfing resort. The results of this study have led to the following recommendations with respect to the establishment of artificial surf reefs: a period of stakeholder consultation with surf community and local community is required to determine whether an ASR is desirable; robust impact assessments of the reef must be carried out by independent parties before a marine licence is granted; expectations of the community must be managed through honest marketing and careful media coverage; planning must include a contingency for the cost of maintenance, repair and even removal if the structure fails to deliver; and further research is required to determine the full social and economic potential of artificial surf reefs.

Emphasis was on the 170 km long Kasegaluk Lagoon, which was known to be regularly used by both species during the open-water season. Belugas were seen on every survey during 3-14 July 1990 and 4-16 July 1991, with numbers ranging from 7 to 1212. Data from other years indicate that whales sometimes arrive as early as 22 June and leave the area by late July. The presence of nearshore gravel beds and warm, low-salinity water probably combine to make this region important as a place for belugas to molt. Spotted seals occur in the area from mid-July through early November. They haul out on particular spits and shoals near Utukok Pass, Akoliakatat Pass, and Avak Inlet. Numbers counted were variable but exceeded 1000 on many days in July, August, and September. Telemetry data suggest that the maximum count of about 2200 represents only a small portion of the total number of seals frequenting Kasegalulr Lagoon. Comparisons with data from previous years suggest that the numbers of belugas and spotted seals using the area have been relatively stable since the late 1970s. Activities associated with oil, gas, coal, and mineral resource development should be regulated to minimize their potential impacts on important beluga and spotted seal habitats.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,,0,0,0,,,0004-0843,,,,,,,,,,,"Alaska Dep.

In this study we examined the combined role of herbivores and climate warming as drivers of CO2 fluxes in two typical high-latitude habitats (mesic heath and wet meadow). We hypothesized that both herbivory and climate warming would reduce the C sink strength of Arctic tundra through their combined effects on plant biomass and gross ecosystem photosynthesis and on decomposition rates and the abiotic environment. To test this hypothesis we employed experimental warming (via International Tundra Experiment [ITEX] chambers) and grazing (via captive Barnacle Geese) in a three-year factorial field experiment. Ecosystem CO2 fluxes (net ecosystem exchange of CO2, ecosystem respiration, and gross ecosystem photosynthesis) were measured in all treatments at varying intensity over the three growing seasons to capture the impact of the treatments on a range of temporal scales (diurnal, seasonal, and interannual). Grazing and warming treatments had markedly different effects on CO2 fluxes in the two tundra habitats. Grazing caused a strong reduction in CO2 assimilation in the wet meadow, while warming reduced CO2 efflux from the mesic heath. Treatment effects on net ecosystem exchange largely derived from the modi. cation of gross ecosystem photosynthesis rather than ecosystem respiration. In this study we have demonstrated that on the habitat scale, grazing by geese is a strong driver of net ecosystem exchange of CO2, with the potential to reduce the CO2 sink strength of Arctic ecosystems. Our results highlight that the large reduction in plant biomass due to goose grazing in the Arctic noted in several studies can alter the C balance of wet tundra ecosystems. We conclude that herbivory will modulate direct climate warming responses of Arctic tundra with implications for the ecosystem C balance; however, the magnitude and direction of the response will be habitat-specific.",,,,,,,,,54,3,0,0,42,0,63,,,0012-9658,1939-9170,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Nottingham, Sch Biosci, Nottingham NG7 2RD, EnglandCtr Ecol & Hydrol, Banchory AB31 4BW, Aberdeen, ScotlandUniv Aberdeen, Sch Biol Sci, ACES, Aberdeen AB24 3UU, Scotland",,,,2008-08-01,WOS:000258236400005,18724721,

A review,,,,,,,,AGRONOMY FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT,,,,30,3,,,557,580,,,,10.1051/agro/2009051,,,,,,,Review,JUL-SEP 2010,2010,"The crisis in the world's fisheries is attributed to excessive fishing pressure, long-term mismanagement, increased population growth, development and improvement of fishing technologies, uncertainty in global fisheries catch data, economic incentives and subsidies, and increasing demand for fish meal. For the coastal fisheries of developing countries, the problem is aggravated by coastal habitat degradation, widespread poverty in coastal communities, inshore encroachment of commercial fishing vessels, use of illegal and destructive fishing methods, resource use conflicts, pollution from uplands, and weak institutional arrangements. In response to these problems and in the hope of reversing their negative effects, fisheries management strategies have emerged for tropical coastal fisheries during at least the past 30 years. In fisheries, it is crucial to determine the outcomes of management strategies, especially when public money has to be accounted for. However, efforts to assess their impacts or measure progress are usually directed towards a single disciplinary approach, which fails to consider the multidimensionality of tropical fisheries including concomitant multi-level and conflicting goals and objectives. This article explores the utility of a multi-criteria type of evaluation as a potential analytical approach in impact evaluation for tropical fisheries management. The general framework of a multi-criteria evaluation method is a two-dimensional matrix composed of different choice possibilities including the set of criteria and indicators that will serve as bases in assessing these choice possibilities. The literature presents various criteria and indicators in fisheries management evaluation, the kinds and number of which would depend on stated goals and objectives of fisheries and the availability of resources to acquire the information. The type of measurement, i.e., quantitative or qualitative, and the weighing of criteria and indicators are crucial in the evaluation process because they determine the multi-criteria aggregation approach to be used. Moreover, the participation of stakeholders and coastal resource users is crucial in complementing scientific information, in developing acceptable solutions, and in reducing conflicts and distrust in the evaluation and decision-making process. While many aggregation models in multi-criteria analysis in natural resource management exist, this article limits its review to only six models: the analytic hierarchy process, the weighted sum model, the ordination technique, concordance analysis, the regime method and Evamix; which are viewed to be applicable to the structure of decision-making in tropical fisheries management. This article also examines the performance of some of these models through a case study that determines the impacts of fisheries management strategies in San Miguel Bay, Philippines.The review reveals the following: (1) among the aggregation approaches, the analytic hierarchy process and ordination technique had the highest number of applications in fisheries while none was found for concordance analysis, the regime method or Evamix; (2) the application of hybrid models in multi-criteria analysis is increasing and found to be effective in many environmental decision problems including fisheries; (3) the application of multi-criteria decision models to fisheries management is relatively scarce during the last 10 years; only 26 papers were found in peer-reviewed journals; and (4) in the choice of model, its technical assumptions and limitations, its appropriatenes for a specific decision-making problem, and its ability to handle the situation correctly vis-a-vis contextual, technical and political concerns should be considered.",,,,,,,,,28,0,0,1,11,1,31,,,1774-0746,1773-0155,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Philippines Visayas, Coll Fisheries & Ocean Sci, Inst Fisheries Policy & Dev Studies, Iloilo 5023, Philippines",,,,2010-07-01,WOS:000281616000004,,

The heart of this so-called 'harmonised mandatory control system' is the 'chemical hazard assessment and risk management' (CHARM) model. This model enables the ranking of chemicals on the basis of their intrinsic properties, using a realistic worst-case scenario. To meet the prerequisites of the model (simple and transparent calculation rules), the CHARM model uses a fixed dilution factor, assuming equal and constant dispersion of chemicals around the platform. In reality, however, the chemical follows a three-dimensional dispersion pattern which will change over time. To be able to use the principles of the CHARM model in such a dynamic situation for risk management, a new model has been developed by TNO in cooperation with Dutch Oil (NAM). This model gives a probabilistic estimation of the ecological risk of produced water, based upon a realistic calculation of the fate of components of produced water after discharge from the platform. Spatial and temporal variation in the concentration of chemicals is summarised in frequency distributions. The ecological risk is calculated for aquatic life, benthic Life and the food chain. The model aims to support the selection of cost-effective mitigating measures for risk reduction. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.

Spar platforms under deep water conditions are found to be the most economical and efficient type of offshore platform. Several Spar platforms installed in the Gulf of Mexico and North Sea proves its suitability for deep water exploration. Accurate prediction of motions of a Spar hull is very important for the integrity and associated costs of the riser/mooring line. The most common approach for solving the dynamics of Spar platform is to employ a decoupled quasi-static method, which ignores all or part of the interaction effects between the platform, mooring lines and risers. Coupled analysis, which includes the mooring lines, risers and platform in a single model, is the only way to capture the damping from mooring lines and risers in a consistent manner. The present coupling is capable in matching the forces, displacement, velocities and acceleration for mooring line with Spar hull at the fairlead position and riser with Spar hull at the riser keel connection. It can handle possible significant nonlinearities. The output from such analyses will be platform motions as well as a detailed mooring line and riser responses. In actual field problems hydrodynamic and aerodynamic loads act simultaneously on Spar platform, mooring lines and risers. In finite element model, the entire structure acts as a continuum. This model can handle all nonlinearities, loading and boundary conditions. The selected configuration of Spar platform is analysed under wave force together with wind loading and its structural response behaviour in steady state is studied. An automatic Newmark-beta time incremental approach in ABAQUS/AQUA environment has been implemented to conduct the analysis in time domain. The wind force acting on the exposed part of the platform encompasses mean and fluctuating wind components. The frontal region includes the topside assembly and the spar hull portion above the sea level. High degree of nonlinearities makes the solutions convergence sensitive and it requires large number of iterations, at each time station. Spar responses in surge, heave and pitch along with top tension in moorings are computed. The coupled Spar experiences significant lateral shift along wave direction due to wind loading. Increase in standard deviation shows the participation of wind loading giving higher fluctuations. The CML tension increases for wind loading but the extent of the tension fluctuations under wind loading is not much due to high pretension of mooring line.",,,,,"33rd ASME International Conference on Ocean, Offshore and Arctic Engineering33rd ASME International Conference on Ocean, Offshore and Arctic Engineering","JUN 08-13, 2014JUN 08-13, 2014","ASME, Ocean, Offshore & Arct Engn DivASME, Ocean, Offshore & Arct Engn Div","San Francisco, CASan Francisco, CA",1,1,0,0,0,0,1,,,,,978-0-7918-4550-9,,,,,,,,,"Univ Malaya, Dept Civil Engn, Kuala Lumpur, MalaysiaIIT Delhi, Dept Appl Mech, Delhi, India",,,,2015-11-18,WOS:000363498500061,,
