Corpses were identified to species and kinds of injury, ages, and fat and muscle scores were determined. Nocturnal bird calls were recorded, identified to species and quantified. Local and large-scale weather parameters were also considered.Results A total of 767 birds of 34 species, mainly thrushes, European Starlings and other passerines, were found at 45 visits. Most carcasses were in good body condition and young birds were not more affected than adults. Three quarters of 563 examined individuals had collision induced injuries. Birds in poor body condition were less likely to be collision victims than those in good condition. Mass collision events at the illuminated offshore structure coincided with increasingly adverse weather conditions and an increasing call intensity of nocturnal birds.Conclusions Assuming an average of 150 dead birds per year at this single offshore structure and additionally assuming that a considerable proportion of the corpses were not found, we estimate that mortality at the 1000 + human structures in the North Sea could reach hundreds of thousands of birds. Since offshore industrialization will progress and collision numbers at offshore turbines will consequently increase considerably, we recommend reinforced measures to reduce bird strikes at offshore structures, especially in the light of substantial declines in some migrant species.",,,,,,,,,21,0,0,0,19,0,23,,,0006-3657,1944-6705,,,,,,,,,,"Inst Avian Res, Vogelwarte 21, Wilhelmshaven, GermanyAvitec Res, Sachsenring 11, D-27711 Osterholz Scharmbeck, Germany",Inst Avian ResAvitec Res,,,2016-04-06,WOS:000372039300009,,

The default model reproduced basic properties of observed beach litter loadings (zero net accumulation, negatively skewed loading distributions) and the observed spatial pattern along the Scottish east coast, with average loadings increasing in the coastal current direction. The VaWWL effect moved the along-coast flux of floating litter offshore as debeaching events occur during offshore winds.

Offshore winds have historically played a leading role in the tourist influx as they are associated with the occurrence of the endemic stinging medusa Olindias sambaquiensis. This species is closely related to warm summers but it could be favored by low temperatures in previous winters. Since summer 2013, a change in the wind pattern was locally perceived coincidently with the absence of the medusa in coastal waters. This work aimed at analyzing if wind pattern and sea surface temperature (SST) showed a measurable change along 2008-2015 and evaluating if this change can be associated to the observed variations in the occurrence pattern of O. sambaquiensis. Winds and SST data were analyzed in periods of high (2008-2012) and low (2013-2015) medusae occurrence, based on media and own observations. A significant change in the wind pattern in Monte Hermoso was detected. Wind speed decreased from 6.3 m s-1 in 2008 to 2.4 m s-1 in 2015 and calms and light winds increased by more than 44.2 and 7.5 %, respectively. This change implied an impediment of coastal upwelling, which is the physical process by which medusae reach the coast, and is associated with persistent (10 h or more) WNW to ENE winds blowing at = 3.3 m s-1. Accordingly, in summer 2008 (period of high medusae occurrence), 45 coastal upwelling-days were detected in contrast to only 8 days in summer 2015 (period of absence of medusae). Also, positive SST anomalies were found over the 8-yr period, suggesting an increasing trend of 0.4 [degree]C. Higher temperatures than normal during recent winters probably affect negatively the polyp reproduction. Our results demonstrate an environmental change in the ecosystem of Monte Hermoso and may explain, in part, the low occurrence of O. sambaquiensis in recent summers. The knowledge of the factors that regulate the occurrence of O. sambaquiensis is fundamental for developing a coastal management plan and/or for determining the first adaptation strategies.",,,,,,,,,6,0,0,0,4,0,6,,,0101-9759; 1982-3908,,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Nacl Sur, Inst Argentino Oceanog, Camino La Carrindanga,Km 7,Edificio E1,CC 804, Bahia Blanca, Buenos Aires, Argentina",,,,2018-07-24,ZOOREC:ZOOR15407038763,,

First, like much of the rest of coastal United States, they are experiencing more pronounced coastal hazards, including sea level rise, increased storm rain events, and surging oceanic waters, resulting in flooding. These factors are complicated by climate change. In addition, as the US moves toward clean energy, wind turbines are beginning to be placed in the ocean off their coasts. These two dynamics could result in new relationships between communities and their coasts. This workshop will explore the implications of the changing nature of the human relationship between coastal communities, coastal processes, and electricity infrastructure in the ocean. The workshop will be oriented toward future research and opportunities to adapt, advance preparedness, and absorb and bounce back after storm events. The workshop will be held in Annapolis, Maryland in Spring 2020, and bring together scientists, planners, citizen groups, and business interests. The transition of the US east coast is characterized by two dynamics: coastal hazards, including rising seas, storm surge and increased precipitation events leading to flooding and inundation, which often have more serious impacts in the most vulnerable coastal populations, and siting and installation of renewable energy infrastructure in the ocean. The workshop seeks a better understanding of these interrelated dynamics with a focus on resilience building efforts and consideration of the development of an offshore wind energy system. The workshop will draw on academia (e.g., social and physical scientists, disaster management specialists and Sea Grant engagement professionals); government (federal, tribal, and state and local planners); adaptation practitioners; coastal civil society; and industry/private sector (chamber of commerce, commercial fishers, offshore wind developers) and focus on the changing human relationship with the coast/sea in small coastal communities. The workshop will work to improve understanding of (a) the links between large-scale coastal changes from physical processes and industrialization of the ocean from offshore renewable energy, (b) how best to engage policymakers in viewing these two forces of change together to find common strategies, overcome institutional barriers, and innovative partnering opportunities with co-benefits, and (c) effective risk communication strategies that articulate tradeoffs and uncertainties related to rapid transitions and resilience building in coastal communities. The workshop will generate an interdisciplinary research roadmap that address emerging coastal community transitions and identifies best practices and risk communication strategies to enhance adaptive capacity and resilience.

The purpose of this study was to simulate oil spill conditions using a microcosm design to examine short-term (2 day) changes in phytoplankton community composition and total biomass following exposure to crude oil obtained from the Deepwater Horizon oil spill and a mixture of Texas crude oils. Microcosm experiments were performed in situ in North Inlet Estuary near Georgetown, SC. A control and six replicated experimental treatments of crude oil additions at final concentrations of 10, 50, or 100 mu l l(-1) of either Deepwater Horizon spill oil or the Texas crude mixture were incubated under in situ conditions. Photopigments were analyzed using high-performance liquid chromatography and community composition was determined using ChemTax. Total phytoplankton biomass (as chl a) declined with increasing crude oil concentrations. Prasinophytes, the most abundant microalga in both experiments, showed no response to oil exposure in one experiment and a significant negative response in the other. Diatoms euglenophytes and chlorophytes appeared relatively resistant to oil contamination at the exposure levels used in this study, maintaining or increasing their relative abundance with increasing oil concentrations. Chlorophytes and cyanobacteria increased in relative abundance while cryptophyte abundance decreased with increasing oil concentrations. The results of these experiments suggest that low levels of crude oil exposure may reduce total biomass and alter phytoplankton community composition with possible cascade effects at higher trophic levels in salt marsh estuaries.",,,,,,,,,48,11,0,0,46,0,70,,,1559-2723,1559-2731,,,,,,,,,,"Univ S Carolina, Marine Sci Program, Columbia, SC 29208 USAUniv S Carolina, Dept Biol Sci, Columbia, SC 29208 USA",,,,2012-05-01,WOS:000302481200013,,

The objective of this study was to evaluate and compare the aquatic toxicity of CuO nanoparticles (NPs) and microparticles (MPs) through acute and chronic toxicity tests with the freshwater microcrustacean Daphnia magna and an acute toxicity test with the bioluminescent marine bacteria Vibrio fischeri. Acute toxicity results for D. magna in tests with CuO NPs (EC50, 48 h = 22 mg L-1) were ten times higher than those for tests with CuOMPs (EC50, 48 h = 223.6 mg L-1). In both periods of exposure of V. fischeri, the CuO NPs (EC50, 15 m 248 +/- 56.39-equivalent to 12.40%; EC50, 30 m 257.6 +/- 30.8 mg L-1-equivalent to 12.88%) were more toxic than the CuO MPs (EC50, 15 m 2404.6 +/- 277.4 - equivalent to 60.10%; EC50, 30 m 1472.9 +/- 244.7 mg L-1 - equivalent to 36.82%). In chronic toxicity tests, both forms of CuO showed significant effects (p < 0.05) on the growth and reproduction parameters of the D. magna relative to the control. Additionally, morphological changes, such as lack of apical spine development and malformed carapaces in D. magna, were observed for organisms after the chronic test. The toxicity results demonstrate that CuO NPs have a higher level of toxicity than CuO MPs, emphasizing the need for comparative toxicological studies to correctly classify these two forms of CuO with identical CAS registration numbers.

The hydrates are found in mounds several meters in diameter and up to 2 m high, and are covered by sediment and mats of the filamentous sulfur-oxidizing bacteria Beggiatoa. The mounds are surrounded by vesicomyid clams (Calyptogena pacifica, C. kilmeri), which in turn are encircled by solemyid bivalves (Acharax sp.). The zonation pattern of 3 species (Calyptogena spp. and Acharax sp., which harbor chemoautotrophic bacteria in their gills, and the chemoautotrophic Beggiatoa), is also reflected in a change in the entire community structure. Beggiatoa, Calyptogena spp. and Acharax sp. are shown to be characteristic species for the different communities. The Beggiatoa community directly overlaying the gas hydrates consists of seep endemic species in high densities: gastropods (Provanna laevis, P. lomana, Pyropelta corymba, Hyalogyrina sp, nov.), bivalves (Nuculana sp, nov.) and polychaetes (Ampharetidae, Polynoidae, Dorvilleidae). Based on pooled samples, the rarefaction curves show a decrease in species diversity in the Beggiatoa and Calyptogena communities. The hydrogen sulfide gradients in the porewater of sediments below the different communities dominated by either Beggiatoa, Calyptogena spp. or Acharax sp. vary by 3 orders of magnitude.

The model was applied to a designated tidal energy test site on the East Coast of the United States, Cobscook Bay, ME. The quantifiable energy production capacity of the tidal stream devices with and without suspended canopies was considered. The effects of both types of structures on hydrodynamics and solute transport were analysed including flushing studies to quantify renewal timescales in the bay. Results demonstrate potential to optimise energy generation by combining turbine arrays with suspended aquaculture canopies. Combining MHK and aquaculture installations did not significantly impact the physical environment beyond the effects of the aquaculture canopies alone.

There is critical and urgent need for long-life unremitting fish monitoring technologies that can help with understanding fish behavior, selecting offshore wind farm sites, operating hydroelectric power plants, and assessing environmental impacts of marine hydrokinetic energy systems. The total market value of global telemetry including fish telemetry tags is estimated to reach $243 billion by 2020. Current fish telemetry tags are constrained by the limited lifetime of batteries, and periodic battery replacements are expensive and harmful to the fish. Another challenge is how to attach these tags to a fish with minimum impact on its normal life. Implanting a tag inside a fish body constitutes a complicated surgery process with the risk of impeding the fish life, and the mechanical clamping to the fin may negatively affect the fish motions. Therefore, this proposal aims at investigating a self-powered strategy and a bio- inspired attachment method for fish telemetry tags through energy harvesting from the surrounding fluid and fish maneuvering. The goals of this GOALI project are to design and validate a novel bio-inspired attachment with a minimal influence on fish life and mobility and a bio-inspired broadband energy harvester to achieve a self-powered fish telemetry tag. The proposed bio-inspired fish tag consists of a bio-inspired bi-stable energy harvester, a bio-inspired sucking disc, an acoustic transmitter, and an integrated circuit board that contains both the transmission circuit, sensors, and the energy-harvesting management circuit. Particularly, the principle behind the Venus flytrap will be fully understood to investigate the snap-through dynamics of the proposed bi-stable galloping piezoelectric harvester subjected to the combined excitations from fish maneuver and fluid flow. The remora-shark symbiotic relationship will be studied and used to guide the design of the bio-inspired sucking pad with stiff metal-based teeny spikes (in mimic the lamellar spinules) to attach the harvester on the fish. The specific work scope includes (1) a bio-inspired design of an attachment mechanism and a self-power sensing and communication system, (2) modeling of the fluid-structure-piezoelectric interaction, (3) the bio-inspired dynamics of the bi-stable piezoelectric energy harvester under complex excitations, and (4) experimental validation on robotic fish, live fish, and on-site demonstrations to investigate the performance and the influence of harvester on the fish life and mobility. The research is integrated with an educational and outreach plan, including course development, undergraduate research, K-12 students and teachers, and opportunities for minorities and women.

Half the sample received images and descriptions of the four previous features, accompanied by questions about fit in the landscape and sadness at loss. These items were combined to create a climax thinking scale. Regression analysis reveals neither place attachment nor time in the region to be predictors of climax thinking, while male gender and conservative politics increase climax thinking. Conservatism decreases support for wind energy among people who can't see turbines from home and is not significant for people who can. Climax thinking increases wind support among people who can see them from home but is not significant for people who can't.

Cells of strain TBF 19.5.1(T) were nonmotile rods with a sheath-like structure, or toga. The strain was Gram-negative and grew at 2080 degrees C (optimum 65 degrees C), pH 5.5-8.0 (optimum pH 6.8) and NaCl concentrations of 10-60 gl(-1) (optimum 25-30 gl(-1)). For a member of the order Thermotogales, the novel isolate is capable of unprecedented growth at low temperatures, with an optimal doubling time of 175 min (specific growth rate 0.24 h(-1)) and a final optical density of >1.4 when grown on pyruvate at 37 degrees C. Various carbohydrates, proteinaceous compounds and pyruvate served as growth substrates. Thiosulfate, but not elemental sulfur, enhanced growth of the isolate. Sulfate also enhanced growth, but sulfide was not produced. The strain grew in the presence of up to approximately 15% oxygen, but only if cysteine was included in the medium. Growth of the isolate was inhibited by acetate, lactate and propionate, while butanol and malate prevented growth. The major fermentation products formed on maltose were hydrogen, carbon dioxide and acetic acid, with traces of ethanol and propionic acid. The G + C content of the genomic DNA was 42.5 mol%. Phylogenetic analyses of the 16S and 23S rRNA gene sequences as well as 29 protein-coding ORFs placed the strain within the bacterial order Thermotogales. Based on the phylogenetic analyses and the possession of a variety of physiological characteristics not previously found in any species of this order, it is proposed that the strain represents a novel species of a new genus within the family Thermotogaceae, order Thermotogales. The name Kosmotoga olearia gen. nov., sp. nov. is proposed.

To study those effects, eggs and larvae of rainbow trout, Oncorhynchus mykiss, were subjected under experimental conditions to a static magnetic field (MF) of 10 m T and a 50 Hz electromagnetic field (EMF) of 1 m T for a period of 36 days (i.e., from eyed egg stage to approximately 26 days post hatching, dph). Neither MF nor EMF had significant effect on embryonic or larval mortality, hatching time, larval growth, or the time of larvae swim-up from the bottom. However, both MF and EMF enhanced the yolk-sac absorption rate. Although it was not related directly to magnetic field effect, it was also shown that larvae with absorbed yolk-sacs by the time of swim-up were less efficient in taking advantage of available food at first feeding (i.e., obtained smaller weight at age).

Our tests are carried out in drained or undrained loading which firstly allows for a characterization of the isotropic compressibility of the material and its matrix by simultaneous measurement of deformation and of the variation in the contained fluid mass.

Due to the distinct advantages of fully polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (Pol-SAR), it has been widely employed to improve oil spillage event observations. In this paper, with the aim of enhancing ocean oil spillage identification, an improved scheme was proposed, which was mainly based on an active contour model (ACM), with a special emphases on choosing an optimal initial box boundary for the ACM model, and a noise suppressing process. In this proposed scheme, the ACM initial box boundary was chosen to be the median level contour of the imagined mountain if regarding image grey values as elevations. Meanwhile, following Lee filter operator, a Gaussian smooth operator was hired to further weaken the speckle noise, thereby making the evolution of ACM more stable. Three sets of RADARSAT-2 fully Pol-SAR data were used to test of the proposed method. In addition, the current study achieved the first complete comparison of the identification abilities of the ten most common recently used fully Pol-SAR features for oil spills. The experimental results show: 1) The features of H; v; span; P; M-33; and rho possessed good distinguishable abilities for oil spillage detection in sea water. Specially, features span and v outperformed other Pol-SAR features with regard to the elaborate distinguishing identifications of small patches of oil spill objects from other small objects, such as oil platforms or ships; 2) An appropriate setting of the initial box boundary of the ACM was able to accelerate the global search, and eventually led to improvements in the accuracy of the oil spill identification, while simultaneously reducing the computational time; 3) The effective noise suppression was confirmed to be very necessary, guaranteeing stability of the ACM evolution. When compared with other traditional methods, the proposed improved scheme was found to be more effective in the overall identification accuracy (99.8%).",,,,,,,,,10,1,0,0,3,0,10,,,2169-3536,,,,,,,,,,,"China Univ Petr, Sch Geosci, Qingdao, Peoples R ChinaQingdao Natl Lab Marine Sci & Technol, Lab Marine Mineral Resources, Qingdao, Peoples R ChinaChina Univ Petr, Grad Sch, Qingdao, Peoples R ChinaState Ocean Adm, North China Sea Marine Forecasting Ctr, Qingdao, Peoples R ChinaPetroChina Res Inst Petr Explorat & Dev, Dept Well Logging & Remote Sensing Technol, Beijing, Peoples R ChinaNatl Lab Marine Sci & Technol, Qingdao, Peoples R ChinaState Ocean Adm, Inst Oceanog 1, Qingdao, Peoples R China",State Ocean AdmState Ocean Adm,,,2018-12-28,WOS:000452459300001,,

The sensitivity analysis of fatigue reliability of mooring line to the uncertainty of random variables in the fatigue limit state is conducted. In addition, the system reliability for mooring system is analyzed and the effect of the initial pretension and safety factor on system reliability is investigated. The results indicate that a case without the initial pretension on anchor lines is helpful to decrease the failure probability of mooring system and the safety factor of mooring lines in the current regulation is conservative for the system reliability against fatigue damage.

These high resolution mesoscale models aim at depicting the expected wind behavior (e.g., wind shear, wind turning, topographically induced flow accelerations) at a particular location or region. Over the years, numerous model sensitivity and intercomparison studies have investigated the strengths and weaknesses of the models' parameterizations (including, but not limited to, planetary boundary layer turbulence) in capturing realistic flows over land. In contrast, only a handful of modeling studies have focused on coastal and offshore flows (e.g., coastal fronts, internal boundary layers, land breeze - sea breeze circulations, low-level jets); thus, our understanding and predictive capability of these flows remain less than desirable. This impairment, in combination with the recent world-wide surge in offshore wind energy development, provides the rationale for this study.We are currently evaluating the performance of the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model, a new-generation mesoscale model, in simulating some of the aforementioned coastal and offshore flow phenomena.

Current flows were low and tidally driven, although prevailing weather conditions could significantly influence the hydrodynamics of the system at times. The cage sediment was highly impacted at the time of cage removal; exhibiting high sulphide levels and a community structure clearly indicative of polluted/ hypoxic conditions. The extent of impact diminished rapidly with both time and distance from the cages. The influence of the cages was not generally detectable at 35m and after 2 months transitional conditions were indicated at the cage stations. However, after 24 months, although the sulphide levels at the cage locations had returned to reference conditions, the benthic community structure still differed significantly from that of reference stations. Several species were identified as indicative of impacted, transitional and recovered conditions. Capitella capitata complex and Malacoceros tripartitus were clearly dominant under impacted conditions; Theora fragilis, Corbula gibba and Euphilomedes sp. (MoV 18) indicated the transitional community; whilst Amphiura elandiformis, Lysilla jennacubinae and Nucula pusilla characterised unimpacted conditions.

The first part of the proposed approach consists in reducing the dimensionality of sensor data made up of the many pixels of each frame of the input video streams. This enables finding a concise number of most relevant parameters to model the temporal dataset, yielding an efficient data-driven model of the evolution of the observed surface. The second part proposes stochastic modeling to better capture the patterns embedded in the data. One can then draw samples from the final model, which are expected to simulate the behavior of previously observed flow, in order to determine conditions that match new observations.

Porewater toxicity varied from low to moderate in the majority of the samples, and polychaetes dominated the benthos. The Grande Island sampling station (Station 1) presented more sandy sediments, differentiated macrobenthic assemblages and the highest metal concentrations in relation to other stations and guideline values, and it was the only station that indicated a possible bioavailability of metals.

The cue works indirectly by avoidance of colder water combined with an increase in swimming activity. Several well-known natural phenomena in silver eel behavior may be accounted for by this hypothesis. Silver eels react to fluctuating or changing temperature conditions by increasing their swimming activity. This is particularly typical when the temperature is lowered. This behavior explains why silver eels emigrate from their lacustrine habitat in connection with spring floods, why the eel halts in the estuaries when reaching marine areas, what causes the migratory routes chosen within the Baltic, why there are such considerable differences in speeds of migration as calculated from tag returns, why silver eels increase swimming speed late in the season, and why they swim both day and night, irrespective of the phase of the moon. The effect of onshore and offshore winds on eel catches may be accounted for by taking the temperature conditions into consideration, and the same factor explains why the swimming speed is reduced when the eels reach the Sound area. The hypothesis that silver eels are brought back to their spawning area by avoiding colder water explains how eels are able to locate the Sargasso Sea, and actually remain there.",,,,,,,,,2,0,0,0,0,0,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"ASKO LAB, BOX 58, S-150 13 TROSA, SWED, SWEDEN",,,,1977-01-01,BCI:BCI197865000234,,

The use of sorbents such as absorbent pads is one method which can remedy oil spills, because of their hydrophobicity and oleophilic nature. However, many of such absorbent pads are non-biodegradable and costly. Bird feathers are able to adsorb oil well due to their structure and are cheap organic materials. This research aims at studying the features of bird feathers which contribute to their oil adsorbing ability, so as to adapt these features to current absorbent pad models to determine an ideal structure that can increase efficiency of oil removal. In this research, pheasant and duck feathers were compared with four types of oil absorbent pads by determining which material absorbs the most oil relative to its initial mass. The materials were further observed using microscopes and a SEM machine. It was determined that pheasant feathers are better at oil adsorbing due to the size of their apparent contact angles, which affect the amount of oil which can enter the pores between the feather fibres (Cassie and Baxter in Trans Faraday Soc 40:546, [1]). It was also found that absorbent pads with larger fibre widths were able to adsorb and retain more oil, which may be due to a higher surface area or a lower contact angle of the oil on the surface of the pad.",,,,,"4th IRC Conference on Science, Engineering and Technology (IRC-SET)4th IRC Conference on Science, Engineering and Technology (IRC-SET)",20182018,Natl Univ Singapore; Nanyang Technol Univ; Singapore Univ Technol & Design; Singapore Management Univ; Singapore Inst TechnolNatl Univ Singapore; Nanyang Technol Univ; Singapore Univ Technol & Design; Singapore Management Univ; Singapore Inst Technol,"Agcy Sci Technol & Res, Singapore, SINGAPOREAgcy Sci Technol & Res, Singapore, SINGAPORE",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,978-981-32-9828-6; 978-981-32-9827-9,,,,,,,,,"Natl Jr Coll, Singapore, Singapore",Natl Jr Coll,,,2019-01-01,WOS:000634520100004,,

In the present study, we sampled copepods in an area of the North Sea with high density of oil production platforms discharging produced water. Environmental modelling was used to predict produced water and copepod trajectories prior to copepod sampling in situ. To maximise output from a minimal number of field samples, a novel and combined methodology was developed to allow exploitation of the same extract for several purposes; contaminant body burden, lipidomics, and metabolomics analysis. PAH body burdens were low compared to laboratory experiments where correlations between PAH body burden and acute toxicity, reproduction and molecular endpoints had been established. Still, station-specific PAH profiles strongly indicated copepod exposure to PW. NMR metabolomics, focusing on water-soluble metabolites, suggested no correlation between metabolites and stations. Interestingly, lipidomics analyses suggested site-specific fingerprints and profiles displayed for acyl-glycerols and wax esters. Potential effects of produced water exposure on lipid metabolism in copepods cannot be ruled out and deserves more attention.

J,,,,,,,,,"Hajj, Muhammad",,Collaborative Research: GOALI: Bio-inspired bistable energy harvesting for fish telemetry tags,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Awarded Grant,Sep 15 2019,2019,"Aquatic systems are highly interconnected, which allow fish to traverse long distances, to dive through a water column, and, for some species, to move between fresh and saltwater environments. There is critical and urgent need for long-life unremitting fish monitoring technologies that can help with understanding fish behavior, selecting offshore wind farm sites, operating hydroelectric power plants, and assessing environmental impacts of marine hydrokinetic energy systems. The total market value of global telemetry including fish telemetry tags is estimated to reach $243 billion by 2020. Current fish telemetry tags are constrained by the limited lifetime of batteries, and periodic battery replacements are expensive and harmful to the fish. Another challenge is how to attach these tags to a fish with minimum impact on its normal life. Implanting a tag inside a fish body constitutes a complicated surgery process with the risk of impeding the fish life, and the mechanical clamping to the fin may negatively affect the fish motions. Therefore, this proposal aims at investigating a self-powered strategy and a bio- inspired attachment method for fish telemetry tags through energy harvesting from the surrounding fluid and fish maneuvering. The goals of this GOALI project are to design and validate a novel bio-inspired attachment with a minimal influence on fish life and mobility and a bio-inspired broadband energy harvester to achieve a self-powered fish telemetry tag. The proposed bio-inspired fish tag consists of a bio-inspired bi-stable energy harvester, a bio-inspired sucking disc, an acoustic transmitter, and an integrated circuit board that contains both the transmission circuit, sensors, and the energy-harvesting management circuit. Particularly, the principle behind the Venus flytrap will be fully understood to investigate the snap-through dynamics of the proposed bi-stable galloping piezoelectric harvester subjected to the combined excitations from fish maneuver and fluid flow. The remora-shark symbiotic relationship will be studied and used to guide the design of the bio-inspired sucking pad with stiff metal-based teeny spikes (in mimic the lamellar spinules) to attach the harvester on the fish. The specific work scope includes (1) a bio-inspired design of an attachment mechanism and a self-power sensing and communication system, (2) modeling of the fluid-structure-piezoelectric interaction, (3) the bio-inspired dynamics of the bi-stable piezoelectric energy harvester under complex excitations, and (4) experimental validation on robotic fish, live fish, and on-site demonstrations to investigate the performance and the influence of harvester on the fish life and mobility. The research is integrated with an educational and outreach plan, including course development, undergraduate research, K-12 students and teachers, and opportunities for minorities and women. The active collaboration between the two universities and industry will guide fundamental research to solve a critical industry need and enable wide dissemination and accelerated implementation of developed knowledge with immediate industry impacts.

It focuses on the microbial and meiofaunal compartments that, being characterized by short generation time, life cycle, sensitivity to environmental disturbance, are expected to respond rapidly to environmental changes and to provide accurate indications on the oil spill impact. The results of these researches demonstrate that increased sedimentary oil contents have generally limited effects on microphytobenthic assemblages, but stimulates benthic bacterial response (in terms of biomass and activity). Benthic protozoa appear to be initially sensitive to oil contamination but are afterwards stimulated. Such increased organic levels (i.e, oil input) might change the structure and functioning of the benthic microbial loop, with important consequences on the higher trophic levels. Generally, oil toxicity induces only initially strong meiofaunal mortality (particularly on copepods, turbellarians and ostracods, but in certain cases also on nematodes) with consequences in terms of diversity, richness and k-dominance curves. Oil disturbance has generally only temporary effects, but changes in trophic structure of meiofaunal assemblages suggest an adaptation of these communities to changes in the benthic microbial loop structure. The use of different microbial and meiofaunal indicators of oil disturbance are discussed and proposed for future monitoring studies.",,,,,,,,,26,0,0,0,20,0,27,,,0957-4352,1741-5101,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Ancona, Fac Sci, I-60131 Ancona, Italy",,,,2000-01-01,WOS:000088280100022,,

Several structures of arsenolipids have been elucidated the last 5 years, demonstrating the chemical complexity of this trace element in the marine environment. Several commercial fish oils and marine oils, ranging in total arsenic concentrations from 1.6 to 12.5 mg kg(-1) oil, were analyzed for arsenolipids using reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography coupled with inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (HPLC-ICP-MS). The arsenolipids were quantified using three different arsenic-containing calibration standards; dimethy-larsinate (DMA), triphenylarsinoxide (Ph3AsO) and a synthesized arsenic-containing hydrocarbon (AsHC) (dimethylarsinoyl nonadecane; C21H43AsO). The observed variation in signal intensity for arsenic during the gradient elution profile in reversed-phase HPLC was compensated for by determining the time-resolved response factors for the arsenolipids. Isotopes of germanium (Ge-74) and indium (In-115) were suited as internal standards for arsenic, and were used for verification of the arsenic signal response factors during the gradient elution. Dimethylarsinate was the most suitable calibration standard for the quantification of arsenolipids, with recoveries between 91% and 104% compared to total arsenic measurements in the same extracts. A range of marine oils was investigated, including oils of several fish species, cod liver and seal, as well as three commercial fish oils.

Degradation was more severe in the vinyl-ester rods based on tensile strength and stiffness results. Deterioration of the fiber matrix interface and consequent fiber debonding was the main failure mechanism. The vinyl-ester rods presented higher water uptake than the epoxy rods in both distilled water and seawater, and lower mechanical strength after exposed in the latter.

Routine scientific surveys largely target bottom or near seabed fisheries and are therefore not wholly appropriate for sampling pelagic species; however, they do provide consistency of methodology and standardisation. Angling returns have a particular value, in that other species may be targeted and anglers can sample ground unavailable to conventional trawls, however, anglers tend only to report large or specimen fish and may report the place of catch as the place of landing. There is some angler reluctance to disclose detail of location of capture of certain species. In general, recreational/anecdotal material did not contradict the findings of scientific survey based evidence, illustrating that these types of data, when considered together, can provide a sound basis for management recommendations. Key findings were: [center dot] Angel shark appears now to be severely depleted and deserves special protection from impacts of fishing. [center dot] The local status of basking shark is known largely though sightings close to the shore of the Northern Irish coast, as these fish migrate to or from feeding and courtship grounds. There are no directed fisheries and accidental bycatch in fisheries is very uncommon. [center dot] The overall North-east Atlantic population of spurdog is depleted and, although angling catches appear to be increasing in Northern Irish waters; this reflects recent changes in recreational fishing patterns and intensity. [center dot] Tope regularly occur in small numbers in scientific trawl surveys and are targeted by anglers and caught as accidental bycatch in Irish Sea fisheries. A seasonal occurrence of tope with an autumn influx to the Irish Sea and the presence of large females and pups in local areas, including Strangford Lough, indicate important nursery areas. [center dot] Lesser spotted dogfish appear to be stable or increasing [center dot] Nursehound appear to be stable or increasing. [center dot] White skate are now rarely observed in Northern Ireland waters and are regarded as severely depleted and extirpated from most of the Celtic Sea ecoregion. [center dot] Common skate are now severely depleted in Northern Ireland waters. [center dot] The thornback ray and blonde ray are stable or increasing in numbers. [center dot] The cuckoo ray is widespread and abundant. This study highlighted the importance of a number of areas off the Northern Irish coast as nursery grounds for several ray species. Nursery hotspots included Belfast Lough, Carlingford Lough and off Dundrum Bay. Despite the status of some rays being stable or increasing in overall terms in the study area, their susceptibility to local depletions should be recognised. Other anthropogenic activities, such as wind farms, tidal turbines, cable laying and aggregate extraction were identified and it is concluded that all have potential to impact on elasmobranch species.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2009-01-01,ZOOREC:ZOOR14604028762,,

The development of offshore wind energy requires accurate information on wind speeds above the surface at least at the levels occupied by turbine blades. Few measured data are available at these heights, and the temporal and spatial behavior of near-surface winds is often unrepresentative of that at the required heights. As a consequence, numerical model data, another potential source of information, are essentially unverified at these levels of the atmosphere. In this paper, a motion-compensated, high-resolution Doppler lidar-based wind measurement system that is capable of providing needed information on offshore winds at several heights is described. The system has been evaluated and verified in several ways. A sampling of data from the 2004 New England Air Quality Study shows the kind of analyses and information available. Examples include time-height cross sections, time series, profiles, and distributions of quantities such as winds and shear. These analyses show that there is strong spatial and temporal variability associated with the wind field in the marine boundary layer. Winds near the coast show diurnal variations, and frequent occurrences of low-level jets are evident, especially during nocturnal periods. Persistent patterns of spatial variability in the flow field that are due to coastal irregularities should be of particular concern for wind-energy planning, because they affect the representativeness of fixed-location measurements and imply that some areas would be favored for wind-energy production whereas others would not.",,,,,,,,,85,3,0,0,2,1,92,,,1558-8424,1558-8432,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Colorado, Cooperat Inst Res Environm Sci, Boulder, CO 80305 USANOAA, Earth Syst Res Lab, Boulder, CO USA",,,,2012-03-05,WOS:000300070400010,,

In order to investigate reinvasion of the Saco mangrove creek (Inhaca Island, Mozambique) by crab megalopae, the timing and spatial distribution of settlement were related to major environmental forcing factors. Several sets of experiments were performed, with different specific objectives, using megalopal collectors. The total supply of brachyuran megalopae to the mangrove creek over a 2 mo period responded to 2 forcing factors, the first related to cycles of tidal amplitude and the second to offshore wind stress. The response of settlement on the collectors to the tidal amplitude cycle was reflected by clear maxima recorded on every spring tide. This contrasts with the results of previous studies analysing single species recruitment processes, which found a much more irregular pattern. This result was interpreted as a consequence of 2 factors: (1) the use of a cumulative number of total Brachyura, which increases the probability of detecting supply pulses, and (2) a larger tidal range at Inhaca than at the locations where most previous studies took place. The results of this experiment suggest interaction of the stochastic effect of offshore wind stress, which maximises transport to the coastal area, with the deterministic effect of the tide and spring-neap cycles, which operate at the nearshore level to carry megalopae to specific mangrove areas. Settlement was also studied by deploying collectors in 3 different strata of the mangroves, and the results showed a differential settlement distribution in favour of lower areas in the vicinity of the mangroves. This suggests subsequent juvenile migration to suitable areas following first moult. Different settlement stimuli were also tested in the field by enclosing in the collectors a mixture of mangrove crabs and mangrove vegetal material. The results were inconclusive, as no significant differences were found; this was attributed to the effects of interference of stimuli between adjacent collectors and of proximity to mangroves.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,,0,0,0,,,0171-8630,,,,,,,,,,,"Instituto do Mar, Laboratorio Maritimo da Guia, Faculdade de Ciencias, Universidade de Lisboa, Estrada do Guincho, 2750-642, Cascais, Portugal",,,,2001-05-31,BCI:BCI200100558524,,

Omega-3 fatty acids are important membrane lipids and have many recognized health benefits, the bioavailability of these fatty acids can therefore be important for achieving the beneficial healthy effects. As important membrane lipids, the incorporation and depletion kinetics of EPA and DHA in biological membranes have been found to be different, DHA was depleted slowly from both erythrocyte and plasma membranes due to the slow re-synthesis of DHA in the body. The bioavailability of omega-3 fatty acids has been reported to be affected by several factors; among the important factors were the digestion and absorption processes of omega-3 containing lipids in the gastrointestinal tract. Both lipid structures and food structures can affect the bioavailability of omega-3 fatty acids. Human studies have shown that the relative bioavailability of omega-3 fatty acids from fish oil (triglyceride formulation) was similar to that from fish, whereas lower relative bioavailability was observed from fatty acid ethyl ester (FAEE) formulation in comparison with other lipid formulations. In vitro studies provided a mechanistic understanding on the varied bioavailability caused by different lipid structures, the lower relative bioavailability of omega-3 fatty acids from FAEE formulation was closely related to the slower digestion rate of FAEE. Microencapsulated fish oil has often been used as a food additive because of its better chemical stability; studies showed that microencapsulation did not affect the bioavailability significantly. Even though food structures also affect the digestion and absorption of omega-3 containing lipids, several studies have shown that long-term intake of fish oil and food products enriched with fish oil is an efficient way to provide EPA and DHA.",,,,,,,,,5,0,0,0,3,0,5,,,1573-4013,2212-3881,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Copenhagen, Fac Hlth & Med Sci, DK-2100 Copenhagen, Denmark",,,,2016-07-06,WOS:000377914000003,,

Most commonly, the focus of CMSP is on the siting of alternative uses across ocean space. This article examines the broader economic and distributional effects of the potential siting of a renewable energy facility (wind power) in a southern New England offshore area that also is used intensively for commercial fishing. For a leading siting alternative, a counterfactual involving the complete displacement of commercial fishing would result in estimated direct output impacts to the regional economy of $5 million, leading to $11 million in direct, indirect, and induced impacts and a corresponding loss of about 150 jobs. Total economic welfare losses were estimated at $14 million, reflecting not only output reductions but also the effects of price increases in the relevant markets. The welfare losses would be progressively distributed, such that households in mid-to high-income categories would likely bear the most significant impacts. Adjusting these welfare losses for society's aversion to income inequality, inequality-adjusted impacts would be more pronounced in areas that are not necessarily located in close proximity to the coastline. Individual low-income households located in five non-coastal census tracts would bear estimated median impacts ( >= $140/year), which would be an order of magnitude larger than those borne by the next group of impacted households. When implementing CMSP, it is critically important to characterize not only the distribution of effects over the coastal ocean but also the distribution of impacts on coupled human communities onshore, including those communities that may not be considered strictly coastal.

After fasting for various time periods (2 to 24 h), four captive harbor porpoises, housed in water and air temperatures similar to those encountered by wild conspecifics, were fed a structured diet of meals larger than usual (each normal meal was 20% of the daily food mass requirement). A few times they were fed ad libitum, but this led to severe constipation, so this feeding method was abandoned for welfare and health reasons.

In addition, theoretical analysis was used to investigate the horizontal ultimate bearing capacity, and finite element analysis was also used in this paper to investigate the influence factors of the bearing capacity of cone-shaped foundation. Based on the theoretical analysis, the formula for horizontal ultimate bearing capacity was deduced. Test results show that, at the same loading eccentricity, cone-shaped foundation can provide higher H-M bearing capacity as well as lower lateral deflection compared to regular circular foundation for wind turbines. In addition, the deflection-hardening behavior of load-deflection curve for cone-shaped foundation is also observed. Numerical analysis results show that the H-M bearing capacity of the cone-shaped foundation increases with increasing aspect ratio and buried depth, however, and decreases with increasing loading eccentricity.

Collision between supply ships and the legs and bracing members of offshore oil rigs, impact of heavy dropped objects on these members, mishandling during the launching and installation of marine structures, explosions and collision of moving ice sheets with offshore structures are examples of such accidents. Prior to an accident, tubular structural members will be carrying their normal operational loads. It is very important that this service load (pre-loading) is considered when the effect of impact damage is going to be estimated.This paper describes the experimental studies in which axially pre-loaded tubes were examined under lateral dynamic impact loads. The tubes were impacted by a dropped object with a velocity of about 7 m/s at their mid-span. The experimental investigation was aimed at gaining an insight and understanding of the dynamic failure and behaviour of the impacted tubes and to provide bench-marking data on the response of axially loaded steel tubes subjected to lateral impact.The main advantage of the current investigation, compared with those carried out previously and reported in the literature, is that both pre-loading and dynamic effects are included in the study. From the results of the experimental work, it can be concluded that pre-loading had a marked effect on the lateral collapse capacity of the cylinders.

However, ITQs are not the perfect management tool and one of the lesser known consequences of ITQ-managed fisheries where ITQs consist of a harvest right is the implicit relationship between ITQ property rights and rights of access to the fishing grounds. This implicit spatial right to the grounds can provide obstacles in the way of allocating water-space within fishing grounds for alternative uses such as marine-protected areas, large-scale aquaculture, and wind farms.

Copper is a constituent of the feed and is an active ingredient of anti-foulants. The salmon farm was placed in fallow after 15 years of production. Sampling was pursued over 27 months. Elevated copper concentrations in the sediments indicated the farm site as a source. Bubble flotation due to gas-emitting sediments from eutrophication is a likely process for accumulating copper in the sea surface microlayer at enriched concentrations. Elevated and enriched concentrations in the sea surface microlayer over distance from the farm site led, as a result of wind-drift, to an enlarged farm footprint. The levels of copper in both sediments and sea surface microlayer exceeded guidelines for protection of marine life. Over the 27 months period, copper levels persisted in the sediments and decreased gradually in the sea surface microlayer. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

A comparative study between three methods for estimating the equivalent neutral winds (ENW) for buoys is carried out. OSCAT winds were closest to ENW estimated by the Liu-Katsaros-Businger (LKB) method. The spatial and temporal windows for comparison were 0.5 degrees and +/- 60 minutes, respectively. The monsoon months (June-September) of 2011 were selected for study. The root mean square deviation for wind speed is less than 2.5 m s(-1) and wind direction is less than 20 degrees, and a small positive bias is observed in the OSCAT wind values. From the analysis, the OSCAT wind values are consistent with in situ-observed values.

The prospect of large, unclaimed ocean spaces has encouraged people to consider developing sea-going settlements. A number of attempts have been made on former oil platforms or cruise ships. But these structures are not designed for permanent living at sea and fall short of meeting dwellers' expectations. Efforts to build large, spacious floating living facilities have struggled to balance cost-effectiveness and structural integrity.This paper describes an innovative, cost-efficient solution to maximize space on offshore structures. To control the cost, the submerged volume of the floater is minimized. To maximize comfort, the available living surface area is also maximized, while the motions of the platform are limited. The proposed solution is based on the principles of tensegrity, which are commonly used on bridges. Cable stays are tensioned at the top of towers to support the weight of both light and cantilevered top-sides. The floater is column-stabilized with four submerged columns.A feasibility study was performed for the design of a Clubstead based off the coast of California. The platform is dynamically positioned and can house up to 270 people. Due to its primary function, as a floating living facility, the architectural design and the engineering studies are intertwined. Iterations are necessary to determine the global characteristics of the ClubStead. The buildings and living spaces are arranged by an architect, within specific offshore-related constraints. The resulting payload is calculated and thus used in the design basis to perform the engineering analysis. The feasibility study focuses on survivability and passenger comfort to assess the novel design. The survivability analysis is based on structural strength and motion predictions in a 100-year storm. Passenger comfort is evaluated in operational conditions.",,,,,"29th ASME International Conference on Ocean, Offshore and Arctic Engineering29th ASME International Conference on Ocean, Offshore and Arctic Engineering","JUN 06-11, 2010JUN 06-11, 2010","ASME, Ocean, Offshore, & Arctic Engn DivASME, Ocean, Offshore, & Arctic Engn Div","Shanghai, PEOPLES R CHINAShanghai, PEOPLES R CHINA",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,978-0-7918-4909-5,,,,,,,,,"Marine Innovat & Technol, Berkeley, CA USA",Marine Innovat & Technol,,,2010-01-01,WOS:000290548800021,,

The Caspian Sea also receives substantial amounts of runoff from agricultural and municipal sources, containing nutrients that have caused eutrophication and subsequent hypoxia in the deep, cold waters. The effect of decreasing oxygen saturation and cold temperatures on oil hydrocarbon biodegradation by a microbial community is not well characterized. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of oxic and anoxic conditions on oil hydrocarbon biodegradation at cold temperatures by microbial communities derived from the Caspian Sea. Water samples were collected from the Caspian Sea for study in experimental microcosms. Major taxonomic orders observed in the ambient water samples included Flavobacteriales, Actinomycetales, and Oceanospirillales. Microcosms were inoculated with microbial communities from the deepest waters and amended with oil hydrocarbons for 17 days. Hydrocarbon degradation and shifts in microbial community structure were measured. Surprisingly, oil hydrocarbon biodegradation under anoxic conditions exceeded that under oxic conditions; this was particularly evident in the degradation of aromatic hydrocarbons. Important microbial taxa associated with the anoxic microcosms included known oil degraders such as Oceanospirillaceae. This study provides knowledge about the ambient community structure of the Caspian Sea, which serves as an important reference point for future studies. Furthermore, this may be the first report in which anaerobic biodegradation of oil hydrocarbons exceeds aerobic biodegradation.

We evaluated their mutagenicity using the Salmonella reverse mutation assay (TA97, TA98, TA100, and TA102 strains), their genotoxicity using the DNA breakage analysis and micronucleus assay, and scavenging activity using the 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl-free radical assay. Cytotoxicity and mutagenicity were not observed for any of the extracts. Genotoxicity was observed for the dichloromethane, ethyl acetate, and methanol extracts at high concentrations, but no DNA damage was observed in the micronucleus assay.

Engagement of community members in recovery efforts is important for mitigating adverse effects of disasters and accelerating the rebuilding process for impacted communities; however, few studies have explored factors that determine participation in oil spill cleanups.Methods: We analyzed data from the Gulf States Population Survey (GSPS) to study the determinants of participating in the Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill cleanup. The GSPS was a random-digit dialing survey conducted on 38,361 adults in counties and parishes in Alabama, Florida, Louisiana, and Mississippi impacted by the oil spill. Using survey estimation to account for the complex survey design, we estimated the probability of cleanup participation and used logistic regression to examine the association between sociodemographic factors and cleanup participation.Results: Approximately 4.7% of residents in affected Gulf communities participated in the cleanup. Most participants were young, men, non-Hispanic white, and employed. Living in an affected coastal county was associated with higher odds of participation (unadjusted odds ratio [OR]: 1.69; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.28-2.24), as was having excellent or very good physical health (OR: 2.05; 95% CI: 1.11-3.81). Older persons were less likely to participate in the cleanup (OR for 65+ age group vs. 18-24 age group: 0.14; 95% CI: 0.05-0.36).Conclusions: Understanding the demographics of cleanup participants may help inform civilian recruitment for future oil spill responses.",,,,,,,,,6,0,0,0,2,0,6,,,0013-9351,1096-0953,,,,,,,,,,"Emory Univ, Dept Epidemiol, Rollins Sch Publ Hlth, 1518 Clifton Rd NE,GCR 467, Atlanta, GA 30322 USAEmory Univ, Dept Environm Hlth, Rollins Sch Publ Hlth, Atlanta, GA 30322 USACtr Dis Control & Prevent, Ctr Preparedness & Response, Atlanta, GA USA",,,,2019-02-27,WOS:000458710800054,30640081,

The details of the methods and techniques can be found in a series of earlier papers published in the Russian language in 1987-2016. The proposed system-morphological approach includes: 1) partitioning of the Earth surface, i.e. precise identification of linear, point, and areal elements of topography considered as a two-dimensional surface without any geological substance; 2) further identification of larger formations: geomorphological systems and regions; 3) analysis of structural relations and symmetry of topography; and 4) various dynamic (litho- and glaciodynamic, tectonic, etc.) interpretations of the observed morphology. This method can be used to study the morphology of the surface topography as well as less accessible interfaces such as submarine and subglacial ones.

Conventional ecosystem model parameterization, which assumes macrozooplankton as the target grazers, leads to upwelling-induced phytoplankton blooms that exhaust available nutrient supply and whose zonal scale increases with wind duration. Offshore zooplankton maxima result from upwelled water with greater total nitrogen concentrations than initial ambient surface water. Substantial vertical mixing in the surface boundary layer sets the vertical scale of the productivity. Phytoplankton sinking contributes to a nearshore accumulation of total nitrogen, and enhances the magnitude and duration of the phytoplankton bloom. The system responds differently when the zooplankton are parameterized to represent microzooplankton. The phytoplankton and zooplankton maxima have more limited zonal extent, are more independent of the duration of wind forcing, and near-surface nutrient levels remain high over most of the domain. When winds are relaxed, the diminished offshore transport reveals the underlying biological oscillations in the microzooplankton-parameterized ecosystem, and reduced vertical mixing decouples surface from subsurface dynamics. In contrast, the macrozooplankton system relaxes to a steady state supporting limited phytoplankton and large zooplankton levels in the upwelling region.",,,,,,,,,48,0,2,0,18,1,58,,,0142-7873,,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Connecticut, Dept Marine Sci, Groton, CT 06340 USAOregon State Univ, COAS, Corvallis, OR 97331 USAUniv Calif Berkeley, Dept Integrat Biol, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA",,,,2000-09-01,WOS:000089173500001,,

Treatment of oiled sea turtles was guided by expected physiological and pathological effects of crude oil exposure extrapolated from studies in other species and from a single loggerhead sea turtle (Caretta caretta) study. While invaluable starting points, inherent limitations to extrapolation, and small sample size of the experimental exposure study, reduce their utility for clinical guidance and for assessing oil spill impacts. Effects of dispersants were not included in the previous experimental exposure study, and cannot be effectively isolated in the analysis of field data from actual spills. A terminal study of pivotal temperature of sex determination using eggs salvaged from doomed loggerhead nests provided an opportunity for an ancillary exposure study to investigate the acute effects of crude oil, dispersant, and a crude oil/dispersant combination in sea turtle hatchlings. Eggs were incubated at 27.2-30.8 degrees C, and hatchlings were randomly assigned to control, oil, dispersant, and combined oil/dispersant exposures for 1 or 4 days. Contaminant exposures were started after a 3 day post-hatching period simulating nest emergence. Turtles were placed in individual glass bowls containing aged seawater and exposed to oil (Gulf Coast-Mixed Crude Oil Sweet, CAS #8002-05-9, 0.833 mL/L) and/or dispersant (Corexit 9500A, 0.083 mL/L), replicating concentrations encountered during oil spills and subsequent response. Statistically significant differences between treatments and non-exposed controls were detected for PCV, AST, uric acid, glucose, calcium, phosphorus, total protein, albumin, globulin, potassium, and sodium. The principal dyscrasias reflected acute osmolar, electrolyte and hydration challenges that were more numerous and greater in combined oil/dispersant exposures at 4 days. Clinicopathological findings were supported by a failure to gain weight (associated with normal hatchling hydration in seawater) in dispersant and combination exposed hatchlings. These findings can help guide clinical response for sea turtles exposed to crude oil and crude oil/dispersant combinations, and indicate potential impacts on wildlife to consider when deploying dispersants in an oil spill response.",,,,,,,,,10,0,0,0,8,0,10,,,2297-1769,,,,,,,,,,,"North Carolina State Univ, Coll Vet Med, Dept Clin Sci, Morehead City, NC 28557 USANorth Carolina State Univ, Coll Vet Med, Ctr Marine Sci & Technol, Morehead City, NC 28557 USANorth Carolina State Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Morehead City, NC USANorth Carolina State Univ, Ctr Marine Sci & Technol, Morehead City, NC USANorth Carolina Wildlife Resources Commiss, Beaufort, NC USADuke Univ, Marine Lab, Nicholas Sch Environm, Beaufort, NC 28516 USATexas Tech Univ, Inst Environm & Human Hlth, Lubbock, TX 79409 USATTU Hlth Sci Ctr, Lubbock, TX USANorth Carolina Aquariums, Ctr Marine Sci & Technol, Morehead City, NC USA",North Carolina Wildlife Resources CommissTTU Hlth Sci CtrNorth Carolina Aquariums,,,2019-10-15,WOS:000497497600002,31681804,

The performance of this model is compared with that of a reduced model that accounts for only two categories, the latter type of sea-ice model being most widely used in global climate models. Two idealized scenarios are considered: polynya formation along a coastline under offshore winds and a low-pressure system passing over an ice field. Furthermore, the two models are compared under more real-world forcing conditions as they exist in the Weddell Sea. In simplified situations, both models produce identical results. Upon introduction of more realistic ambient conditions, however, the multicategory model produces larger open water fractions than the two-level model. Concomitantly, and consistently with earlier findings, the multicategory model produces thicker ice. This is a result of the larger horizontal gradients of ice motion which, in turn, are due to the weaker ice strength that arises from a higher abundance of thinner ice. This leads to more open water as well as increased dynamical growth of ice. The open water fraction is of relevance in global ocean circulation models, where the amount of open water influences the deep- and bottom-water formation rates such as in conjunction with Antarctic coastal polynyas.",,,,,,,,,47,1,4,0,1,0,51,,,2169-9275,2169-9291,,,,,,,,,,"Finnish Inst Marine Res, FIN-00931 Helsinki, FinlandUniv Helsinki, Div Geophys, Helsinki, FinlandTexas A&M Univ, Dept Oceanog, College Stn, TX 77843 USA",Finnish Inst Marine Res,,,2005-09-17,WOS:000232111200001,,

The primary motivation for this project is the recognition that the UK energy industry must focus on the transition from oil and gas to carbon-free production.In this project, we propose to develop a digital North Sea Emissions Atlas to support the decarbonisation of the UK energy sector and contribute to the emergence of the connected UK Digital North Sea. The focus of our innovation is the prototype of the Emissions Atlas, a flexible emissions monitoring database feeding a geospatial portal, created for a major UK North Sea net-zero emissions energy hub.The Emissions Atlas will enable the cost-effective monitoring of greenhouse gas emissions associated with:\* oil and gas production for domestic needs during the energy transition;\* decommissioning/abandonment of oil and gas infrastructure;\* production of natural gas (mainly methane) for blue hydrogen fuel generation;\* carbon capture and storage in the subsurface, in synergy or not with blue hydrogen production.The Emissions Atlas will be based on open data from academia and industry. Within the project, we will research and develop innovative techniques to support the scalable data management of the complex data types required for monitoring greenhouse gas emissions, compile an extensive database, and develop modelling methods to obtain flux estimates from the data using physics-based models.The deliverables of the Emissions Atlas prototype include a demonstrator product to serve as basis for the short-term development of a fully commercial product. We anticipate the Emissions Atlas will help establish IGI in the carbon-free energy market by increasing the range of specialist consultancy and software products it provides. This project will thus contribute to placing IGI in a strong position to support the energy transition in the UK, and ultimately globally. This project is expected to have a positive climate impact for the UK by helping it reach the 2050 net-zero emissions target. The prototype will, on the medium-term, be extended to have the capacity to support the future UK decarbonisation industry. IGI will promote Equality, Diversity and Inclusion, involving women in more than half of the project roles, including management and R&D.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,85969,,,,,,,,Integrated Geochemical Interpretation Limited,Integrated Geochemical Interpretation Limited,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:15385179,,

Fish species and abundance can be examined in a variety of methods such as a fish finder using an acoustic wave and fishing gears such as a gill net. However, the fish finder cannot specify the species of fish that is sometimes estimated from the experience of fishermen or scientific researchers. Some amounts of fish must be removed from the target sea area in case of using the fishing gear, while the species of fish can be specified. In the present study, an underwater optical video camera is combined with the fish finder using an acoustic wave to specify the species of fish. A circular fish-eye digital video camera is inserted into a waterproof container. A part of the container is made of glass in a dome shape for the circular fish-eye lens. The container is attached to polyethylene ropes and is towed by a fishing vessel. First, the hydrodynamic characteristics of the container was examined by a towing test with the three kinds of towing speed in a water tank. Then the container was towed in the real sea, which is the demonstration site of offshore wind and wave energy developments off Kamaishi of Iwate Prefecture. The depth of the video camera with the container was not constant since the moving speed of the fishing vessel was slow and fluctuating. The image of video camera could be captured successfully together with that of the acoustic video camera, while fish could not be found in both the optical and acoustic measurements in the present investigation.

Two sites presented differences in community structure, characterized by high densities of nematodes, gastrotrichs and turbellarians, and low densities of copepods. Chrysene and triphenylene were only found at these two disturbed sites and could be responsible for differences of meiobenthos community structure. However, differences in community structure of sites could be linked with sedimentary parameters, and discrimination between the effect of PAHs and sedimentary parameters was impossible due to the lack of baseline studies on meiobenthos and PAHs contents in this area.

Therefore, it is crucial to understand how oil influences the microbial communities in sediments that play key roles in ecosystem functioning. Ecosystems such as sediments are characterized by intensive bioturbation due to burrowing macrofauna that may modify the microbial metabolisms. It is thus essential to consider the bioturbation when determining the impact of oil on microbial communities. In this study, an experimental laboratory device maintaining pristine collected mudflat sediments in microcosms closer to true environmental conditions - with tidal cycles and natural seawater - was used to simulate an oil spill under bioturbation conditions. Different conditions were applied to the microcosms including an addition of: standardized oil (Blend Arabian Light crude oil, 25.6 mg.g1 wet sediment), the common burrowing organism Hediste (Nereis) diversicolor and both the oil and H. diversicolor. The addition of H. diversicolor and its associated bioturbation did not affect the removal of petroleum hydrocarbons. After 270 days, 60% of hydrocarbons had been removed in all microcosms irrespective of the H. diversicolor addition. However, 16S-rRNA gene and 16S-cDNA T-RFLP and RT-PCR-amplicon libraries analysis showed an effect of the condition on the bacterial community structure, composition, and dynamics, supported by PerMANOVA analysis. The 16S-cDNA libraries from microcosms where H. diversicolor was added (oiled and un-oiled) showed a marked dominance of sequences related to Gammaproteobacteria. However, in the oiled-library sequences associated to Deltaproteobacteria and Bacteroidetes were also highly represented. The 16S-cDNA libraries from oiled-microcosms (with and without H. diversicolor addition) revealed two distinct microbial communities characterized by different phylotypes associated to known hydrocarbonoclastic bacteria and dominated by Gammaproteobacteria and Deltaproteobacteria. In the oiled-microcosms, the addition of H. diversicolor reduced the phylotype-richness, sequences associated to Actinobacteria, Firmicutes and Plantomycetes were not detected. These observations highlight the influence of the bioturbation on the bacterial community structure without affecting the biodegradation capacities.",,,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2016-05-18,DRCI:DATA2016081008682673,,

This work assesses summer fog events contribution to nitrogen deposition and availability for forest ecosystems. Rain and fog samples were collected at Mt Areskutan, Sweden, during CAEsAR (Cloud and Aerosol Characterization Experiment), in 2014. NH4+ + NO3- represent (31 +/- 25) % of total rain ion amount, and (31 +/- 42) % in fog. Based on ion concentrations and the nitrate stable isotope signatures delta(N-15) and delta(O-18), it was possible to detect the plume generated by the Vastmanland forest fire; NOx emissions from oil rigs and Kola Peninsula; and the plume of Bardarbunga volcano, Iceland. Scavenging of ions by fog was more efficient than by rain. Rain NH4+ and NO3- deposition was (26 +/- 36) mu mol m(-2) d(-1) and (23 +/- 27) mu mol m(-2) d(-1), respectively. Fog NH4+ and NO3- contributed (77 +/- 80) % to total wet deposition of these species. Upscaling rain deposition fluxes to 1 year gave an inorganic nitrogen deposition of (18 +/- 16) mmol m(-2) a(-1) ((252 +/- 224) mg m(-2) a(-1) N equivalents), whereas fog deposition was estimated as (59 +/- 47) mmol m(-2) a(-1) ((826 +/- 658) mg m(-2) a(-1) N equivalents). Annual fog deposition was four times higher than previously reported for the area which only considered rain deposition. However, great uncertainty on the calculation of fog deposition need to be bear in mind. These findings suggest that fog should be considered in deposition estimates of inorganic nitrogen and major ions. If fog deposition is not accounted for, ion wet deposition may be greatly underestimated.

At coastal convergence zones, raptors may aggregate along coastlines because of convective or wind conditions. However, the effect of wind and thermal convection on migrating raptors may vary depending on local landscapes and weather, and on the flight strategies of different raptors. From 20 August to 14 October 2008 and 2009, we studied the effect of cloud development and crosswinds on the flight paths of raptors migrating through the eastern Black Sea convergence zone, where coastal lowlands at the foothills of the Pontic Mountains form a geographical bottleneck 5-km-wide near Batumi, the capital of the Independent Republic of Ajaria in southwestern Georgia. To identify key correlates of local aggregation, we examined diurnal variation in migration intensity and coastal aggregation of 11 species of raptors categorized based on size and flight strategies. As reported at other convergence zones, migration intensity of large obligate-soaring species peaked during the core period of thermal activity at mid-day. When clouds developed over interior mountains and limited thermal convection, these large obligate-soaring species aggregated near the coast. However, medium-sized soaring migrants that occasionally use flapping flight did not aggregate at the coast when clouds over the mountains weakened thermal convection. Numbers of alternate soaring-flapping harriers (Circus spp.) peaked during early morning, with these raptors depending more on flapping flight during a time of day with poor thermal convection. Small sparrowhawks (Accipiter spp.) aggregated at the coast during periods when winds blew offshore, suggesting aggregation caused by wind drift. Thus, weather conditions, including cloud cover and wind speed and direction, can influence the daily rhythm and flight paths of migrating raptors and, therefore, should be accounted for before inferring population trends from migration counts.",,,,,,,,,22,0,0,0,23,0,25,,,0273-8570,1557-9263,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Amsterdam, Inst Biodivers & Ecosystem Dynam, NL-94248 GE Amsterdam, NetherlandsBatumi Raptor Count, Sakhalvasho, Kobuleti Distri, GeorgiaHawk Mt Sanctuary, Acopian Ctr Conservat Learning, Orwigsburg, PA 17961 USAUniv Oxford, Dept Zool, Edward Grey Inst Field Ornithol, Oxford OX1 3PS, England",Batumi Raptor CountHawk Mt Sanctuary,,,2014-04-02,WOS:000331876400005,,

For a specific test site, the issue remains of how to obtain a limited set of environmental conditions for these test cases, sometimes known as bins, which can accurately recreate the conditions. When considering a floating offshore wind turbine, it is necessary to obtain a timeseries of not only the wave conditions, but also the wind conditions (and perhaps current, if possible). Thus, it is common to have greater than 5 dimensions in the time series (e.g., significant wave height, wave period, wave direction, wind speed, wind direction, etc). The creation of bins in two dimensions is quite easily solved by creating an arbitrary grid and taking the mean of all the observations which fall in a specific cell. In higher dimensions, an N-dimensional cell is not easily visualized and so the resulting set of bins cannot easily be graphically represented. In this paper, an efficient, iterative algorithm is developed to convert N-dimensional metocean data into a set of discrete bins of arbitrary size. The algorithm works by setting a tolerance level on the number of observations that must be included in a cell in order to create a bin. If the population threshold is not met, the observations remain unbinned and another iteration is required. Generally, the population threshold can be a function of iteration number so that all observations will be binned. The algorithm can properly take into account extreme data by setting a tolerance level on the N-dimensional distance by which an observation can be included in a certain bin. A quality measure, q, is created to measure the level of representation of the original data by a set of bins, independent of the number of bins. Depending on the tolerance levels, the algorithm can be completed in seconds on a normal laptop for the available data set of 20 years with a 3-hour sampling rate. The observations and bins from a case study are shown as an example of how the bins can be created and visualized.",,,,,"36th ASME International Conference on Ocean, Offshore and Arctic Engineering36th ASME International Conference on Ocean, Offshore and Arctic Engineering","JUN 25-30, 2017JUN 25-30, 2017","ASME, Ocean Offshore & Arctic Engn DivASME, Ocean Offshore & Arctic Engn Div","Trondheim, NORWAYTrondheim, NORWAY",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,978-0-7918-5778-6,,,,,,,,,"Principle Power Inc, Emeryville, CA 94608 USA",Principle Power Inc,,,2017-12-22,WOS:000417228200057,,

Less well understood is the response of porpoises to sounds emitted from oil and gas (O&G) platforms during routine operations. The responses are not easily predictable as platforms can act simultaneously and to varying degree as a source of disturbance through noise and attraction through an artificial reef effect with increased prey abundance and diversity. To investigate the presence and feeding behaviour of harbour porpoises around platforms, autonomous acoustic loggers were placed for up to 2 years, at 21 stations 0-25.6 km from the largest platform in the Danish North Sea. Harbour porpoises were detected at all distances year round in two distinct seasonal activity patterns. During July-January, porpoises were attracted to the platform as indicated by high foraging activity within 800 m of the platform. Echolocation activity levels were up to two-fold higher than that observed at 3.2-9.6 km from the platform. Similar high echolocation activity was observed 200 m from neighbouring offshore installations located within 15 km, during May-July, regardless of their size. This study shows that porpoises may be attracted to offshore O&G platforms despite confirmed elevated underwater noise, and are likely exploiting higher prey abundance in the vicinity of such structures. This is possibly due to increased prey availability created by the combined effect of the artificial reef formed by the underwater structure and the local protected area around all platforms where fishery is banned. Hard substrate and untouched seabed are rare and valuable habitats to many organisms in heavily trawled waters like the North Sea and the ecological importance of these structures should be considered in the development of decommissioning strategies. Study site and experimental design Acoustic monitoring was carried out from July 2013 to July 2015, to record noise levels and harbour porpoise echolocation activity around DanF, located 200 km west of Denmark (Fig. 1). The study area is characterised by sandy sediments and relatively flat bathymetry ranging between 40 and 46 m (Fig. 2, Delefosse et al. 2017). Around all Danish O&G installations, a 500-m fishing exclusion zone is enforced, which corresponds to an area of approximately 1.9 km2 around DanF. To investigate spatial variation in porpoise echolocation activity, 18 acoustic monitoring stations were deployed around DanF at various distances and with replicates along two transects for most distances to avoid data loss (2x0 m, 2x0.2 m, 2x0.4 km, 2x0.8 km, 2x1.6 km, 2x3.2 km, 2x6.4 km, 9.6 km, 12.8 km and 2x25.6 km; Fig. 2). Station locations were chosen to avoid overlap with other O&G installations and minimize variation of environmental factors (e.g. depth). The station located at 12.8 km was placed at Regnar, an inactive subsurface wellhead with dimensions 7.5 m x 6.5 m x 4.5 m that may act as an artificial reef, but does not emit any sound. One station was placed at 25.6 km from DanF as a control stations for the central North Sea (no reef effect and no noise from platforms are present. Note that only six months recording is available, Table S1). At all stations, harbour porpoise presence was monitored using C-PODs (Chelonia Ltd, Penzance, UK); these are calibrated acoustic click detectors (Clausen et al. 2018). Furthermore, five stations (0, 0.2, 0.8, Regnar and 25.6 km away from DanF) were equipped with calibrated broadband loggers (SM2M+ or SM3M+, Wildlife Acoustics, Boston, USA) to record noise emitted from the platform and other sources in the area. All equipment was deployed 2-3 m above the seafloor with the hydrophone pointing upwards to cover the entire acoustic water column. The potential effect on echolocation and noise recordings of instruments being placed near the bottom was considered insignificant (see Supplementary material). To verify findings from DanF and Regnar, C-PODs data deployed at 200 m from three other platforms (HalfdanB, Skjold and Kraka), were available from a different project during May-June 2014 (Fig. 2). Together with DanF and Regnar, the three platforms represent a relatively wide range of sizes, industrial activity, light and sound level typical of O&G installations in the shallow (<100 m) central North Sea (seabed footprint 93-6996 m2, in the following order from small to large: Regnar only subsea, Kraka small and unmanned, Skjold, HalfdanB and DanF large platforms with light and manned, Delefosse et al., 2017). Data analysis - porpoise detections C-POD data were processed with CPOD.exe v2.043. Following Clausen et al. (2018), the click train filter was set to include click trains with a minimum of five clicks and a mean instantaneous frequency between 100 and 160 kHz, avoid transient erroneous clicks from unknown sources to be included. Data were exported as Porpoise Positive Minutes (PPM, i.e. a minute where at least one click train is detected). In addition, all occurrences of click trains with inter-click-intervals (ICI) shorter than 15 ms were extracted. Whilst such short ICIs have been shown to mediate social communication in porpoises (Sorensen et al. 2018), they are more frequently characteristic of echolocation buzzes (74% vs. 26%; Sorensen et al. 2018), which are used during prey pursuits (Verfuss et al. 2009; Wisniewska et al. 2016). We therefore assume that the majority of such click trains are a measure of foraging effort, and they are presented here as Buzzing positive minutes (BPM). Only full recording days (1440 minutes) were considered in spatial and temporal analyses. The instruments were set to stop recording when it reached a maximum value of 4095 clicks per minute to avoid memory overload. Due to this truncation, minutes with more than 4095 clicks were excluded from the analysis, as they were considered saturated and incomplete. Each minute within 24 hours was assigned to either day or night using civil twilight (http://aa.usno. navy.mil). To reduce any potential influence of an unbalanced data design, only C-PODs with data from a minimum of three days within a month were included in the analyses. We initially explored spatial (distance to platforms) and temporal (diel to month-to-month scale) patterns in porpoise echolocation activity using generalized additive mixed models (GAMM, see Supplementary material). Based on these preliminary results, we found two distinct porpoise activity periods and therefore grouped data from February-June and July-January. We then calculated the % PPM for day and night (D/N) conditions at all stations for the two identified periods separately. Percentage of PPM was logit-transformed to fulfil the assumption of normality of residuals (Warton and Hui 2011) and analysed using linear mixed effects models (one model for each period) with the interaction between distance to platform and D/N conditions classed as fixed effects. For all mixed models (here and below), C-POD ID, transect ID, and year were fitted as nested random effects. Temporal dependence among observations was modelled using an autocorrelation structure of order 1 (corCAR1), because this structure provided the best model compared to other correlation structures based on lowest AIC (Pinheiro and Bates 2000). Moreover, for all mixed effects models constructed, any significant differences in the response variable between and within fixed effects groups were estimated using the Bonferroni-corrected Tukey honest significant difference test. We computed the percentage ratio of BPM to PPM (i.e. percentage of time with echolocation clicks that was dedicated to buzzing) for D/N at all stations for the two identified periods separately. To simplify interpretation of the results, stations were grouped as follows: ≤ 800 m from DanF (the platform), 6.4 km from the platform (control), Regnar (12.8 km from platform) and 25.6 km from the platform (control), for this analysis the other distances were excluded to make a simple comparison between platforms vs. control stations. These station groups were, a posteriori, identified as representing reef/platform noise, no reef/ low platform noise, reef/no background noise and no reef/no background noise, respectively. Percentage of BPM/PPM was logit transformed to fulfil the assumption of normality of residuals and analysed using linear mixed effects models (one model for each period) with an interaction between distance and D/N conditions as fixed effects. For inter-platform comparison, we calculated the %PPM for each day of May, June and July 2014 using data recorded at 200m from the five platforms and at a control area (6.4 km from DanF). Percentage of PPM was logit transformed to fulfil the assumption of normality of residuals and analysed using linear mixed effects models with the interaction between month and platform (+control) as a fixed effect. Data analysis - noise The broadband acoustic data were analysed using custom-written routines in Matlab R2015a (Mathworks, Inc., Natick, MA, USA). For ease of processing, the 46-minute-long SM2M+ or SM3M+ sound files were subdivided into sections of 10-second duration that were subsequently averaged over 5 minutes. Prior to averaging, the routines excluded logger artefacts and porpoise clicks from further analysis (Clausen et al, 2018). Up to 10 10-second-long sections per 46-minute file were removed this way. The mammalian auditory system is typically modelled as a filter bank approximated by one-third octave bands (Richardson et al., 1995). Hence, we calculated the received third-octave rms sound pressure levels (TOLs, dB re 1 Pa rms), using a third-octave filter bank implemented in Matlab according to the ANSI standard S1.6-1984 (Christophe Couvreur, Faculte Polytechnique de Mons, Belgium). Occasionally, very brief noise events exceeded the clip level of the broadband recording device, but given the temporal resolution of the data, this should not have affected the average TOL values. Our analysis focused on bands with the highest noise levels (centred at 315 Hz, 5.0 and 31.5 kHz), and on a subset of bands highlighted in the EUs Marine Strategy Framework Directive (centred at 63, 125 and 2,000 Hz). For each frequency band, we tested for differences in ambient noise levels (mean TOL over 5 minutes) as a function of distance to the platform, taking into account both D/N conditions and the two porpoise activity periods identified with the GAMMs. To do so, we fitted linear mixed effects models with the 3-way interaction between distance to platform, D/N condition and porpoise activity period as a fixed effect.

Four potential regions of wind energy with altitudes up to 3,000 m were selected and a three-bladed, 2 m diameter small HAWT was designed for those regions. Starting time was combined with output power in an objective function to improve the performance of the turbine at low wind speeds. The goals of the objective function, the output power and the starting performance, were addressed by geometry optimization of the blade which was carried out by the genetic algorithm. The modified Blade-Element Momentum (BEM) theory was applied to calculate the output power and starting time. Results show that the performance of an optimal blade which was optimized for operating at sea level degrades for other regions. That degradation is more important for the starting performance in comparison with the reduction of the power coefficient. To improve the performance of the blade in the considered regions, two redesign procedures were carried out. First, the geometry of the blade was optimized respect to the air density of the regions which led to increase of the power coefficient and the starting time. Much more power was achieved using the second approach in which the tip speed ratio was added to the geometry of the blade as an additional design variable.

To ensure the safety of the WTIV during preloading, the bearing capacities should be evaluated based on the soil data at each borehole. Eight boreholes (OW-1 to -8) have been drilled in the Southwest Sea of South Korea. The bearing capacities of a spudcan designed to be used in this district are calculated using both a conventional analysis and finite element analysis with the soil properties of OW-1 to -8. A finite element analysis is carried out for OW-1, -3, and -4 to gain an in-depth understanding of the soil behavior during the penetration. OW-1, -3, and -4 are representative boreholes for a strong layer overlying a soft layer, a general soft layer, and a soft layer overlying a strong layer, respectively. The resultant bearing capacity curves versus the depth of the numerical analysis are compared with the conventional method. The results show that the conventional analysis is conservative.

Estuaries of the GOM are dynamic environments, with constant fluctuations in salinity and dissolved oxygen, including large hypoxic zones during summer months. Spawning fish in northern GOM estuaries following the DWH incident were at significant risk of oil exposure, and adverse environmental conditions at the time of exposure, such as hypoxia and low salinity, could have exacerbated developmental effects in the offspring. The present study investigated the effects of F-0 parental oil exposure in different environmental scenarios on development of F-1 sheepshead minnow (SHM) offspring. Adult SHM were exposed to the high-energy water accommodated fraction (HEWAF) of crude oil in three environmental scenarios: normoxic (NORM), hypoxic (HYP), and hypoxic with low salinity (HYP-LS). Parental HEWAF exposure in the NORM scenario resulted in developmental effects in F-1 offspring, including altered heart rate, decreased length at hatch, and impaired prey capture. Co-exposure of F-0 SHM to HEWAF and adverse environmental conditions altered HEWAF effects on F-1 heart rate, hatch rate, prey capture, and survival. Time to hatch was not significantly impacted by parental HEWAF in any environmental scenario. The present study demonstrates that parental exposure to HEWAF results in developmental changes in F-1 embryos, and co-exposure to adverse environmental conditions altered the effects for several developmental endpoints. These data suggest that SHM exposed to oil in estuaries experiencing hypoxia or low salinity may produce offspring with worsened outcomes. These developmental effects, in addition to previously reported reproductive effects in adult fish, could lead to long-term population level impacts for SHM.",,,,,,,,,7,0,0,0,5,0,7,,,0141-1136,1879-0291,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Connecticut, Dept Pathobiol & Vet Sci, Storrs, CT USAUniv Connecticut, Ctr Environm Sci & Engn, Storrs, CT USALeiden Univ, Leiden Univ Coll, Inst Environm Sci, The Hague, NetherlandsUniv Southern Mississippi, Dept Coastal Sci, Ocean Springs, MS USAPurdue Univ, Dept Forestry & Nat Resources, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USAConnecticut Sea Grant Coll Program, Groton, CT USA",Connecticut Sea Grant Coll Program,,,2019-12-12,WOS:000500180400010,31394415,

Captured moths were analyzed for pollen with scanning electron microscopy. H. zea moths captured in January 1989 in the Lower Rio Grande Valley of Texas when citrus was not blooming were not contaminated with Citrus spp. pollen. Sixty percent of those captured on 17 March 1989 during the citrus blooming period were contaminated with Citrus sp. pollen. None of the moths sampled in that area between 21 March and 2 April 1990 were contaminated with Citrus spp. after a major freeze in December 1989.

To increase the density of the power production in the farm, the deployment of wave energy converters (WECs) in the spaces between FWTs could be considered. However, the cost of energy from WECs is still very large. Therefore, the deployments of the WECs will reduce the economic value of the total project. In the present paper, a combined concept involving a combination of Spar-type FWTs and an axi-symmetric two-body WECs is considered. Compared with segregated deployments of FWTs and WECs, this combined concept would imply reduced capital costs of the total project because it will reduce the number of power cables, mooring line and the structural mass of the WECs. However, the effect of the addition of a Torus (donut-shape heaving buoy) on the FWTs motions as well as the power production should first be investigated. In the present study, coupled (wave- and wind-induced response-mooring) analysis is performed using SIMO/TDHMILL3D in the time domain to study the motion behaviour of the combined concept and to estimate the power production from both FWT and WEC under operational conditions. Mooring tension in the combined concept is also compared with the mooring tension in the Spar-type FWT alone. Hydrodynamic loads are determined using Hydrol). The validated simplified method called TDHMILL is implemented to calculate the aerodynamic forces as a function of the relative wind velocity. The analysis is performed for several operational conditions according to metocean data taken in the Statfjord field in the North Sea. Finally, the behaviour of the combined concept under operational conditions is assessed, and it is shown to result in a positive synergy between wind and wave energy generation in terms of both capital investment and power production.

These data would be used to assess possible qualification of sites as Special Protection Areas (SPAs), inform casework (particularly in relation to offshore wind farm developments) and develop cost-effective monitoring methods to assist with Biodiversity Action Plan targets and a national seaduck monitoring strategy. An aerial survey technique was introduced in 2001/02, following a method recently developed in Denmark, incorporating the use of a Global Positioning System (which enables the locations of birds to be recorded with a high degree of accuracy), and using 'distance' sampling (whereby not all birds are detected but, using the distance from the plane of observed birds, the true number of birds present can be calculated). Aerial survey was undertaken in 2002/03 (in August, November, December, January, February and May). Liverpool Bay was surveyed in all months (although parts of the southeastern corner were not covered in some) and Cardigan Bay in all months except January and May. Surveys covered nearshore and shallow waters and extended, in most areas, to around 25 km from shore. Carmarthen Bay was only surveyed in August. Counted totals of Common Scoter were markedly higher than in 2001/02, exceeding 12,000 birds in Liverpool Bay in three of the four winter months, and exceeding 24,000 in February 2003; numbers over Shell Flat alone were 14,000 in the same month, the highest recorded aerial survey total of Common Scoter at a single UK site to date. Counted numbers in Cardigan Bay varied between 2000 and 4000. Estimates of the true number present (calculated using 'distance analysis' as part of a separate exercise) suggest that at least 25,000 birds were present in Liverpool Bay during winter months in 2002/03, and over 79,000 in February 2003. Numbers in Liverpool Bay as a whole, and perhaps within some of its constituent sites, therefore exceeded the 1% international threshold (16,000) and, following similar numbers in the previous two winters, the site qualifies for designation as a marine Special Protection Area (SPA). No estimates were made of true numbers in Cardigan Bay. Sites favoured by Common Scoter in Liverpool and Cardigan Bays closely matched those identified in 2001/02. There was an apparent shift of birds to deeper waters as winter progressed, presumed to be in response to food depletion. A survey in August 2002 recorded over 6000 birds, a time of year when wildfowl moult their wing feathers and are flightless for a period of 4-6 weeks; circumstantial evidence supports the suggestion that a proportion was likely to have been flightless. Very few birds remained by mid May, suggesting (based on observations in spring 2002) that the main departure from Liverpool Bay occurs in late April or early May. Numbers of divers - which were not all identified to species, but most of which are likely to have been Redthroated Divers - were widely distributed throughout Liverpool and Cardigan Bays. Birds were present between November and February, and their distribution extended further offshore than scoters. Counted numbers were relatively small, but exceeded the 1% national threshold in Liverpool Bay in three months. Estimates using 'distance analysis' suggest that between 250 and 1200 birds were present during winter months in 2002/03. Similar numbers were recorded in 2001/02 and, following UK Government guidelines that sites supporting this number of species listed on Annex 1 of the EC Birds Directive qualify as an SPA, Liverpool Bay also qualifies for designation as a marine SPA based on numbers of divers. Large numbers of gulls and auks were recorded in many months during survey in 2002/03: gulls were thinly but widely distributed throughout the survey area, while the distribution of auks varied between months, presumed to be in response to changes in the distribution of their prey. Further aerial survey is recommended using the same technique to improve understanding of changes in numbers and distribution during the winter, late summer and spring periods, and to assess variation between years. Surveys should be undertaken of the whole of Liverpool bay - from Anglesey to Morecambe Bay - to cover all areas important for the key species as synchronously as possible.

The dominant feature of the Mertz Glacier Tongue (MGT), located at approximately 145 degrees E, was a highly productive winter coastal polynya system, until its calving in February 2010 dramatically changed the regional icescape.'' This study examines the annual mean, seasonal, and interannual variabilities of sea ice production; basal melting of the MGT; ice shelves, large icebergs, and fast ice; Dense Shelf Water (DSW) export; and bottom water properties on the continental slope and rise, and assesses the impacts of the calving event. The interannual variability of the winter coastal polynya regime is dominated by the regional offshore winds and air temperature, which are linked to activity of the Amundsen Sea low pressure system. This is the main driver of the interannual variability of DSW exported from the AGVL region. The calving event led to a decrease in sea ice production that resulted in a decrease in the density of DSW export. Subsequently, there is extensive freshening downstream over the continental shelf and slope regions. In addition, it is found that the calving event causes a significant decrease in the mean melt rate of the MGT, resulting from a decrease in ocean heat flux into the cavity due to ocean circulation changes.",,,,,,,,,25,0,0,0,6,0,26,,,0894-8755,1520-0442,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Tasmania, Antarctic Climate & Ecosyst Cooperat Res Ctr, Private Bag 80, Hobart, Tas 7001, AustraliaUniv Tokyo, Atmosphere & Ocean Res Inst, Kashiwa, Chiba, JapanHokkaido Univ, Inst Low Temp Sci, Sapporo, Hokkaido, JapanTokyo Univ Marine Sci & Technol, Tokyo, JapanUniv Tasmania, Inst Marine & Antarct Studies, Hobart, Tas, AustraliaAustralian Antarctic Div, Kingston, Tas, AustraliaNatl Inst Polar Res, Tachikawa, Tokyo, JapanGrad Univ Adv Studies SOKENDAI, Tachikawa, Tokyo, Japan",,,,2018-12-28,WOS:000391855700011,,

The supporting evidence is (1) the association of occurrences of blackpoll warblers at Bermuda with westerly winds, (2) the low average weight of all mainland samples of blackpoll warblers, (3) the average weight of the birds at Bermuda, which is higher than those from mainland populations, (4) the similarity in migratory behavior of blackpoll warblers and other sp. of passerines in coastal areas, and (5) the similarity in the relative abundance of warbler sp. in coastal populations and at Bermuda. That the radar data on southward movements of small passerines are of blackpoll warblers departing on a trans-Atlantic flight is doubtful, because the radar data do not correlate well with the migration of the warbler. || ABSTRACT AUTHORS: Author",,,,,,,,,16,0,0,0,1,0,16,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Univ.

The results demonstrate clearly different periods with a succession of different bacterial populations. Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs) that could be related to Chloroflexus, Burkholderia, Desulfovibrio and Cytophaga genera were found among the populations well adapted to crude oil exposure. To further evaluate the metabolic ability to degrade hydrocarbons of such oil contaminated microbial communities, we studied the diversity of the genes encoding enzymes known to be involved in hydrocarbon compounds degradation: the naphthalene and the phenanthrene dioxygenases. This analyses indicated that although diverse Polyciclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAH) dioxygenases encoding genes were detected after a three months period of contamination, they were mainly represented by only three different types. Thus, taxonomic (16S rRNA encoding gene) and functional (dioxygenases encoding gene) diversity analysis indicated that microbial communities of microbial mats may adapt to oil pollution.

Therefore, it is common practice to attempt to deter the mammals out of potential danger zones beforehand. Seal scarers are commonly used as a deterrent for harbour porpoises in spite of a lack of clear evidence in support of their effectiveness. We investigated the responses of harbour porpoises to a Lofitech seal scarer by conducting visual observations in conjunction with sound measurements. Porpoise sighting rates within 1 km of the seal scarer significantly decreased to only 1% during seal scarer activity. During 22 trials, when the seal scarer was deployed between 300 m and 3.3 km distance, all observed porpoises always avoided the seal scarer within 1.9 km (translating to sound levels of = 122 dB re 1 mu Pa-rms), avoided the seal scarer half the time within 2.1 to 2.4 km 9119 to 121 dB re 1 mu Pa-rms) and never avoided the seal scarer at distances beyond 2.6 km (<= 118 dB re 1 mu Pa-rms). The closest observed approach distance of a porpoise to the activated seal scarer was 798 m 9132 dB re 1 mu Pa-rms). Thus, the deployment of a Lofitech seal scarer during offshore pile driving activities can greatly reduce the risk of acoustic traumata to harbour porpoises. However, danger zones and thus the necessary deterrence zones have to be calculated specifically for each project based on measurements of sound transmission in the area.",,,,,,,,,34,0,0,0,27,0,35,,,0171-8630,1616-1599,,,,,,,,,,"BioConsult SH, D-25813 Husum, GermanyITAP GmbH, D-26129 Oldenburg, Germany",BioConsult SHITAP GmbH,,,2013-03-13,WOS:000314935000022,,

Body mass index and waist-to-thigh ratio were the strongest predictors for serum ferritin when controlling for age (P < 0.001). In multiple regression analysis, when anthropometric measurements were excluded, fibrinogen, high density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol and diastolic blood pressure were significant predictors for serum ferritin levels when controlling for age (P < 0.001). There was a significant difference in triglyceride concentration between those with low stores of iron and those with high stores (P = 0.006). There were consistently higher levels of total cholesterol, triglycerides, fibrinogen, diastolic and systolic blood pressure, except for HDL where it was reversed, in the highest quartile of serum ferritin levels compared to the lowest.

We recorded 200 min of underwater noise during the construction of seven anchor pipes. Underwater noise was recorded simultaneously at three positions with a water depth of 9 m with increasing distance to the construction site to assess the disturbance potential to the marine fauna. The recorded vibration embedment noise was a continuous sound with durations of 2-55 s, with most energy below 1 kHz and peak frequencies around 900 Hz. Background noise level at a distance of approximately 1 km increased around 13 dB at frequencies between 800 and 1000 Hz. We estimated the sound propagation by a non-linear logarithmic regression by means of the intercept, slope and attenuation factor, which allowed us to evaluate the received sound levels that reach an animal in certain distances from the construction site. The estimated sound exposure level (SEL) of the source was 148.2 dB re 1 mu Pa(2)s and the median SEL ranged from 120 to 99 dB re 1 mu Pa(2)s at distances between 394 and 2288 m, respectively. Behavioural thresholds for indigenous species of marine mammals in the Wadden Sea as well as representative fish species were used to determine effect radii of vibration embedment noise. Our study showed that the detected anchor pipe vibration embedment noise might exert a behavioural reaction on a local scale. Marine mammals could be affected by the construction operations up to a distance of 375 m and fish up to a distance of 766 m. These zones of responsiveness for vibration embedment operations are relatively small, compared to pile driving, which is regularly used during construction operations.

No significant variation in the microbial community and oil biodegradation was observed during the wet season experiments due to high background nitrogen levels eliminating the effect of biostimulation. Larger variations were observed in the dry season experiments and were correlated to enhanced alkanes removal in the biostimulated microcosms, where Alphaproteobacteria dominated the total microbial community by the end of biodegradation (54%).

Quantitative PCR directed toward specific functional genes revealed that oiled marshes were greatly diminished in the population sizes of diazotrophs, denitrifiers, nitrate-reducers to ammonia, methanogens, sulfate-reducers and anaerobic aromatic degraders, and harbored elevated numbers of alkane-degraders. Illumina 16S rRNA gene sequencing indicated that oiling greatly changed the structure of the microbial communities, including significant decreases in diversity. Oil-driven changes were also demonstrated in the structure of two functional populations, denitrifying and sulfate reducing prokaryotes, using nirS and dsrB as biomarkers, respectively. Collectively, the results from I6S rRNA and functional genes indicated that oiling not only markedly altered the microbial community structures, but also the sizes and structures of populations involved in (or regulating) a number of important nutrient biogeochemical cycles in the saltmarshes. Alterations such as these are associated with potential deterioration of ecological services, and further studies are necessary to assess the trajectory of recovery of microbial-mediated ecosystem functions over time in oiled saltmarsh sediment.

Hence, efforts are required to detect the potential variability in growth and metabolic accumulation between Ulva strains and ultimately select the best performing strains under given environmental conditions. Here, the growth, physiological, and metabolic characteristics of 49 laminar Ulva spp. strains were investigated using a custom-made high-throughput phenotyping platform, enzymatic assays, and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. We found large natural variation for a wide range of growth and metabolic characteristics, with growth rates varying from 0.09 to 0.37 mg.mg(-1).d(-1) among strains. Ulva spp. possess a unique diurnal growth pattern and primary metabolism compared with land plants, with higher growth rates during the night than during the light period. Starch and sucrose only contributed on average 35% of the carbon required to sustain Ulva's night growth. Nitrates accumulated during the night in Ulva tissues, and nitrate accumulation and consumption was positively correlated with growth. In addition, we identified six amino acids as possible biomarkers for high growth in Ulva. The large variability in growth and metabolite accumulation recorded among morphologically similar Ulva strains justifies future efforts in strain selection for increasing biomass, metabolite yields, and nutrient removal in the growing aquaculture industry.",,,,,,,,,31,1,0,0,28,0,32,,,0032-0889,1532-2548,,,,,,,,,,"Natl Univ Ireland Galway, Plant Syst Biol Lab, Ryan Inst, Plant & AgriBiosci Res Ctr,Sch Nat Sci, Galway H91 TK33, IrelandNatl Univ Ireland Galway, Genet & Biotechnol Lab, Ryan Inst, Plant & AgriBiosci Res Ctr,Sch Nat Sci, Galway H91 TK33, IrelandMax Planck Inst Mol Plant Physiol, D-14476 Potsdam, GermanyCtr Plant Syst Biol & Biotechnol, Plovdiv 4000, Bulgaria",Natl Univ Ireland GalwayNatl Univ Ireland GalwayCtr Plant Syst Biol & Biotechnol,,,2019-05-17,WOS:000466860800017,30755474,

Building on earlier research (Jay et al., 2012; Kannen, 2014), the analysis adopts a political ecology perspective, and uses a stakeholder analysis and interviews to identify main actors in the MSP process and their interests in and perceptions of the North Sea, its management and the MSP process. The results confirm earlier research that MSP was used strategically to facilitate offshore wind energy development at the expense of other uses. MSP resolved some matters of spatial competition but not all, and solved few underlying conflicts, since these involve deep-seated tensions among diverse actor perceptions of the North Sea and its management. The research finds the German North Sea EEZ remains a politicized environment, in which MSP is a post-political approach to planning. The research highlights inter-agency tensions and politics as further signs that MSP as post-political planning has not eliminated politics in sea management.",,,,,,,,,34,0,0,0,9,0,34,,,0143-6228,1873-7730,,,,,,,,,,"Ludwig Maximilians Univ Munchen, Dept Geog, Luisenstr 37, D-80333 Munich, Germany",,,,2019-12-13,WOS:000500199700006,,

The distribution of the UK fleet of large ( > 15 m length). fishing vessels was analysed and clear gear-specific temporal and spatial differences in activity were found. Mobile demersal gears had the highest intensity and widest distribution of activity in the study area, and so might be expected to have the most widespread ecosystem-level impacts. The potential effects of two proposed fisheries closures; a planned wave energy testing facility (Wave Hub) and a candidate offshore Marine Protected Area (Haig Fras) are described. Maps indicate that mobile demersal gear fleets would be little affected if they were excluded from these proposed closures, but if the static gear fleets were excluded this would likely result in displacement of certain vessels, increasing fishing pressure on other rocky grounds and other fishers. Predictions concerning the effects of fisheries displacement can be improved through the use of high-resolution gear-specific activity data. This study shows that VMS can provide an invaluable source of such data, provided that gear information is made available to fisheries managers and scientists. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

When these metropolises are located in semiarid regions, this challenge takes on enormous proportions, and in many situations, there are no sustainable solutions, especially in times of global climate change. One hypothesis to try to mitigate this problem in coastal cities is the underwater adduction of rivers. The objective of this paper was to make the abstraction of drinking water in the mouths of great rivers near semi-arid regions. This water would be led by a pipeline below the water level and would follow the route of the seacoast, where the energy to move the water would be supplied by an axial hydraulic pump embedded in the pipeline by water-cooled electric motors driven by the energy generated from offshore wind turbines. Estimates have been made for the four metropolises in semi-arid regions: Fortaleza-Brazil, Dalian-China, Tel Aviv-Israel, and Gaza-Palestine, where it was possible to calculate economic viability through the Present Worth Value, the internal rate of return, and payback. The results indicated that Fortaleza had economic viability under restrictions. Dalian proved the ideal result. Tel Aviv and Gaza both had great economic viability, but only if Egypt agreed to supply water from the Nile.

Lately, there has been an increased interest among the industry also to compensate for the movement of a secondary vessel, which indicates that a more detailed investigation of the Vessel-to-Vessel Motion Compensation (VVMC) problem is required. The primary motivation for such compensation technique is influenced by the demand for load transfer between ships during harsh weather conditions, service on floating wind turbines and fish farms, and the transportation of personnel and equipment safely between two floating vessels, for instance. In this paper, the capability of the Leica AT960 laser tracker to measure the relative position and orientation between the two moving Stewart platforms simulating the vessels movement at sea is investigated.

Prior to their migration, eels develop a silver coloration being referred to as silver eels. Due to the dramatic European eel recruitment decline, it is crucial to quantify silver eel escapement to evaluate the success of measures taken under Eel Management Plans (Regulation EC (1100/2007)). Thus, the percentage of silver eels escaping from the River Mondego (Portugal) was estimated during two consecutive spawning seasons (2014-2016) and their migratory behaviour was studied. Thirty-six male silver eels were tagged with acoustic transmitters and their downstream migration was tracked using automatic receivers deployed at four locations along the river course, from the first impassable obstacle up to the river mouth (67 km). Among the tagged eels, 15 (42%) escaped to the sea. In both years, individuals displayed faster migration speed in the downstream reaches of the river. BRT (Boosted Regression Trees) models were used to explain downstream migration and escapement of silver eels. The analyses revealed that the downstream migration is triggered by several environmental variables with water conductivity as the most influential predictor. Escapement of eels from the estuary occurred a few hours after their arrival and was primarily explained by the offshore wind intensity, which promotes a current in the coast that may favour their transport to the open sea. These findings contribute to a better understanding of silver eel migration in southern latitudes and highlight and reinforce the need to monitor spawner escapement.",,,,,,,,,9,0,0,0,7,0,9,,,0906-6691,1600-0633,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Lisbon, Fac Ciencias, MARE Ctr Ciencias Mar & Ambiente, P-1749016 Lisbon, PortugalUniv Lisbon, Fac Ciencias, Dept Biol Anim, Lisbon, PortugalUniv Evora, MARE Ctr Ciencias Mar & Ambiente, Evora, PortugalUniv Evora, Dept Biol, Escola Ciencias & Tecnol, Evora, Portugal",,,,2020-04-15,WOS:000523693600001,,

If the observer views the horizon and closes their eyes, however, the stimulus size and contrast ratio are epileptogenic for solar elevation angles down to approximately 5 degrees.Discussion:Large turbines rotate at a rate below that at which the flicker is likely to present a risk, although there is a risk from smaller turbines that interrupt sunlight more than three times per second.

In this paper, we assess the potential risks related to the application of CCS technology and the acidification of aquatic ecosystems through CO2 enrichment. We use the multiple lines of evidence approach (LOEs) to characterize the effects of the acidification with contamination in aquatic sediments. We highlight and discuss the effects of acidification on the LOEs including contamination and mobility of contaminants in sediments, toxicity, macrobenthic community structure, in situ effects, and bioaccumulation biomagnification processes. We further assess the results of acidification on the toxicity of organic contaminants such as antibiotics or illicit drugs like the freebase form of cocaine (crack). The main goal of using the LOE approach is to distinguish between adverse effects that are associated with contaminants and those related to acidification by enrichment of CO2 as a result of CCS technology. Previous assessments were not designed or conducted to incorporate an integrative point of view, nor did they employ a weight of evidence approach (WOE) in risk characterization and management of CCS operations and other situations related to acidification by enrichment of CO2 in the aquatic ecosystem. Based on the findings of this review, the WOE can identify the effects of the acidification on the different LOEs used for sediment quality: contaminant mobility, the adverse effects in organism under laboratory and field conditions, and the bioaccumulation-biomagnification of contaminants. The main strength in using the WOE is the ability of this method to discriminate between LOE responses associated with contamination by different organic and inorganic substances from those related to CO2 acidification itself. The WOE will significantly improve the risk assessment in areas affected by potential leakages of CO2 during CCS operations.",,,,,,,,,6,0,0,0,2,0,6,,,1208-6053,1181-8700,,,,,,,,,,"Santa Cecilia Univ UNISANTA, Dept Ecotoxicol, Santos, SP, BrazilUniv Cadiz, UNESCO UNITWIN WiCop, Fac Marine & Environm Sci, Cadiz, SpainFed Univ Sao Paulo UNIFESP, Dept Marine Sci, Santos, SP, BrazilUniv Atacama, CIC, UDA, Copiapo, Chile",,,,2019-09-12,WOS:000483087100006,,

Together, these results show that soil PAHs are mainly of pyrolytic origin, e.g. exogenous (airborne) contributions of fossil fuel combustion products and (old) vegetation fires, with a small contribution of uncombusted fossil fuels. This approach using molecular and isotope information represents a promising way to study the fate of ancient, reworked, fossil organic matter in modern media such as soils, sediments, plants, air and food.

While the higher penetration of renewable energy is currently the backbone of Green Econotny efforts, an emerging body of literature demonstrates that the renewable energy sector can affect ecosysteins and biodiversity. The current review synthesizes the existing knowledge at the interface of renewable energy and biodiversity accross the five drivers of ecosystem change and biodiversity loss of the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment (MA) framework (i.e. habitat loss/change, pollution, overexploitation, climate change and introduction of invasive species). It identifies the main impact mechanisms for different renewable energy pathways, including solar, wind, hydro, ocean, geothermal and bioenergy. Our review demonstrates that while all reviewed renewable energy pathways are associated (directly or indirectly) with each of the five MA drivers of ecosystem change and biodiversity loss, the actual impact mechanisms depend significantly between the different pathways, specific technologies and the environmental contexts within which they operate. With this review we do not question the fundamental logic of renewable energy expansion as it has been shown to have high environmental and socio-economic benefits. However, we want to make the point that some negative impacts on biodiversity do exist, and need to be considered when developing renewable energy policies. We put these findings into perspective by illustrating the major knowledge/practices gaps and policy implications at the interface of renewable energy, biodiversity conservation and the Green Economy.",,,,,,,,,221,3,1,2,70,0,238,,,1364-0321,1879-0690,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Tokyo, Integrated Res Syst Sustainabil Sci IR3S, Tokyo, JapanUnited Nations Univ, Inst Adv Study Sustainabil IAS, Tokyo, JapanUniv Tokyo, GPSS GLI, Kashiwa, Chiba, Japan",,,,2017-04-01,WOS:000396184900016,,

These highly dynamic environments are controlled principally by wave energy, tides and grain size, generating complex morphodynamic patterns that translate into strong area variation. Estimates of beach area and its variability are prime inputs for coastal management, a challenge that requires data representing a wide spatiotemporal scale. In this paper, a Landsat-based semi-automated methodology was developed to reconstruct the area of 21 sandy beaches of the Montevideo (Uruguay) coast from 1984 to 2016. This long-term information was also used to discern erosion-accretion cycles by means of wavelet analysis, and to explore the role of climatic forcing on these cycles through linear mixed models. A random forest classification algorithm was applied to Landsat images in order to estimate beach area. Long-term trends described a 27-year cycle with well-delimited quasi-decadal erosion and accretion phases related to climatic configurations. The beach area was negatively affected by an increase in sea level and climatic conditions of the previous year, being positively correlated with sea surface temperature anomalies and offshore winds (which favored accretion) and negatively correlated with onshore winds and intense El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) events (favoring erosion). Our findings, together with the predicted increase in the occurrence and intensity of storms and extreme ENSO events, constitute a worrying scenario, as erosion in this populated coastal zone could have negative social, economic and ecological repercussions. The methodology developed here was useful to detect long-term changes in beach area and is entirely based on open-access information. Therefore, it is potentially applicable at any location on the planet. This approach is also useful to counteract the scarcity of long-term information that has precluded robust assessments of climate change effects on coastal zones.",,,,,,,,,23,0,0,0,19,1,26,,,0272-7714,1096-0015,,,,,,,,,,"UNDECIMAR, Fac Ciencias, Igua 4225, Montevideo 11400, UruguayDirecc Nacl Recursos Acuat, Constituyente 1497, Montevideo 11200, Uruguay",Direcc Nacl Recursos Acuat,,,2019-03-07,WOS:000459519700020,,

Breaking waves play an important role by developing a well-defined mixing layer in the upper part of the water column. A three-dimensional (3-D) Lagrangian random walk oil spill model was used here to study the influence of sea surface waves on the vertical turbulence movement of oil particles. Three vertical diffusion schemes were utilized in the model to compare their impact on oil dispersion and transportation. The first scheme calculated the vertical eddy viscosity semi-empirically. In the second scheme, the vertical diffusion coefficient was obtained directly from an Eulerian hydrodynamic model (Princeton Ocean Model, POM2k) while considering wave-caused turbulence. The third scheme was formulated by solving the Langevin equation. The trajectories, percentages of oil particles intruding into water, and the vertical distribution structures of oil particles were analyzed for a series of numerical experiments with different wind magnitudes. The results showed that the different vertical diffusion schemes could generate different horizontal trajectories and spatial distributions of oil spills on the sea surface. The vertical diffusion schemes caused different water-intruding and resurfacing oil particle behaviors, leading to different horizontal transport of oil particles at the surface and subsurface of the ocean. The vertical diffusion schemes were also applied to a realistic oil spill simulation, and these results were compared to satellite observations. All three schemes yielded acceptable results, and those of the third scheme most closely simulated the observed data.",,,,,,,,,13,8,0,0,5,0,17,,,0256-1530,1861-9533,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing 100049, Peoples R ChinaNatl Marine Environm Forecasting Ctr, Key Lab Res Marine Hazards Forecasting, Beijing 100081, Peoples R ChinaChinese Acad Sci, Inst Atmospher Phys, Beijing 100029, Peoples R China",,,,2013-11-08,WOS:000325810700006,,

They employed their well established and flexible technique of whole air sampling followed by high sensitivity gas chromatographic analysis including straight-chain saturated hydrocarbons from C-1 (methane) to C-12 (dodecane) and aromatic hydrocarbons such as benzene, toluene, as well as and higher molecular weight species, with special attention to the presence of toxic contributors. Where possible, atmospheric chemical species associated with dispersal agents such as Corexit were determined as well. A variety of platforms of opportunity were identified. These were the 65 ft vessel R/V Eugenie from the deck of which 96 whole air samples were collected between May 20 and May 23. The initial results were so informative that 48 sampling canisters were sent to the R/V Pelican and 96 to the NOAA ship Thomas Jefferson. In addition 120 samples were collected from a Twin Otter aircraft. This RAPID study is one of three that makes up the bulk of a coordinated response to examine trace gas emissions from the oil leak. The second used methane data (AGS-1048798, RAPID: Spatially Enhanced Broadband Array Spectrograph System (SEBASS) Survey Over the Gulf Oil Spill) collected from the same Twin Otter aircraft to map methane plumes and the third RAPID (AGS-1042894, RAPID: Fossil-Fuel Extraction Industry Methane Emission Ground Reference Measurements during the AVIRIS Response to the Gulf Oil Spill) used the remote sensing platform AVIRIS on the NASA ER-2 aircraft to measure methane remotely and on a larger spatial scale.

This paper outline the historical and the recent trend on development and management of artificial reefs (ARs) program in Malaysia which was carried out by four main departments ie. the Department of Fisheries Malaysia (DoFM), Fisheries Development Authority Board of Malaysia (FDAM), Marine Park Department (MPD) and the Malaysian Maritime Enforcement Agency (MMEA). A study to understand the developmental changes in ARs technology especially in the design, construction, installation, material used, where these changes were caused by past management policy on ARs development was done. Data and information that was gathered from past published and unpublished papers/technical reports/annual reports mostly written by officers and researchers were reviewed to support the study. Initial monitoring on the fish catches using the latest design of the artificial reefs on few locations was also done. Study shows that continuous research and development as well as management experiences by Malaysia for more than 35 years has resulted in major modifications in ARs technology especially in the design, construction, installation, pre and post-deployment monitoring, as well as material used. It was found that, the four agencies have different in their policy objectives and guidelines in ARs management concerning the material used, deployment and assessment. It seemed that the concept and purpose of establishing ARs from the beginning was also not clearly defined by these agencies and has cause unsustainable way in managing the ARs.

During austral summer, strong northward alongshore winds aid the offshore movement of early-stage model larvae from midshelf hatching sites into open ocean; during austral winter, eastward flows that feed the enhanced Leeuwin Current facilitate onshore movement of late-stage larvae towards nearshore habitats. Stokes drift induced by swells from the Southern Ocean is critical to retain larvae off the west coast. Diurnal migration and temperature-dependent growth are also important. Model larvae hatched in late spring - early summer grow faster because of longer exposure to warm summer temperature, which allows them to be transported towards the coast by the strong onshore flows in winter and reduces their natural mortality. Preliminary source sink relationship indicates that the population was well mixed off the coast, with higher likelihood of settlement success from hatching sites in the north, mostly due to higher surface temperature.

In oiled birds, the distance travelled during the first 0.4 s after takeoff was reduced by 29%, and takeoff angle was decreased by 10 degrees compared to unoiled birds. Three-axis accelerometry indicated that oiled sandpipers produced less mechanical power output per wingbeat during the initial phase of flight. Slower and lower takeoff would make oiled birds more likely to be targeted and captured by predators, reducing survival and facilitating the exposure of predators to oil.

Red snapper were tagged with depth transmitters and movements were tracked (n = 7; VR2W Positioning System, Vemco Ltd., Nova Scotia) on an artificial reef site 28 km south of Dauphin Island, Alabama in the northern Gulf of Mexico for two years. More than 3.5 million accurate positions (similar to 1 m) were obtained and used to assess red snapper depth patterns over monthly and hourly time periods. In addition, three-dimensional (3-D) patterns of red snapper volume use (m(3)) were estimated based on depth and location (latitude, longitude) from >700,000 3-D positions. Red snapper depth preferences and volume use varied over time periods. Red snapper tended to stay at deeper depths during the colder months (<3 m from seafloor), and move up in the water column more frequently in the late spring and summer months (F-23,F-127 = 45.5, P<0.0001). Similarly, volume use patterns varied significantly by month (core, F-23,F-127 =13.14, P < 0.0001; home range, F-23,F-127 = 27.6, P <0.0001) with the smallest movements in February and largest in August (2013) or October (2014) depending on year. Diel home range volume showed that red snapper made fewer movements during night (1900-0400 h) compared to day (0600-1700 h; F-23,F-3585 = 13.2, P<0.0001). The present habitat use patterns were surprising, because for the most part red snapper were previously considered a benthic oriented reef species. However, in the present study depth and volume shape patterns showed use of the entire water column during the spring and summer. These higher water column use patterns were likely related to spawning patterns and prey availability over both diel and monthly time periods, but further studies are needed to help confirm such correlations.

In 2019, SMRU Consulting were commissioned by Marine Scotland to update the recommended demographic parameters for modelling and to carry out a sensitivity analysis of the outputs to misspecification of population demographic parameters, to ensure that current model outputs were appropriate and that users understand the potential implications of uncertainty in baseline demographic parameters. The review of demographic parameters involved a desk-based literature review of information that has become available since the previous report was published on the trajectory, size and demographic parameters of the cetacean management units (MUs) and seal management areas (MAs) for the five species of marine mammals most relevant to Scottish waters (grey and harbour seals, harbour porpoise, bottlenose dolphins and minke whales). Several key species experts were consulted in the process of the review. The evaluation of the sensitivity of outputs to misspecification of demographic parameters focused on the ratio output metric of the counterfactual of population size (the median of the ratio of the impacted to un-impacted population size across all simulated matched replicate pairs). This was felt to be more appropriate than the ratio of the impacted to un-impacted growth rates due to the nature of the impact on marine mammals, with disturbance during discrete periods of construction activity rather than a continuous level of impact over an extended period. Two approaches were used in the sensitivity testing: The effect of changing the value of a single parameter independently of the others (this was done for all species except grey seal) and the effect of adjusting all the demographic parameters systematically to compare scenarios with the same population trajectory but different combinations of demographic parameters. Section Four summarises the results of the review of demographic parameters and presents updates where new information has been published since the last review (Harwood and King, 2017). New information has been published on all species to inform our understanding of population trajectories, but not all populations had updated demographic information available. One major difference from the previous review is that recommended values have now been provided for English harbour seal management areas where they were absent before. Section Five presents the results of the sensitivity analysis. The observed sensitivity to misspecification is complex. It depends both on the proportion of the population that experiences disturbance above the threshold that experts judged is required to affect vital rates, and the magnitude of the effect on the vital rate, as well as on the effect of the parameters on the starting stable age structure of the population. The analyses demonstrate substantial variation in sensitivity to parameter misspecification among species and demographic variables. The greatest sensitivity was to variation in the value of pup survival for harbour seals and, overall, changes in pup/calf survival had the greatest impact on the counterfactual of population size. This pattern results from the fact that pup/calf survival is the demographic variable that experts considered to be most sensitive to the effects of disturbance. As a result, most of the simulations predicted some effect of the operation being modelled on pup/calf survival, whereas effects of fertility were rare. In addition, the effect of the additional mortality associated with disturbance depends on the absolute value of the demographic rate that is affected. The widest range of pup survival values was used in the analysis of harbour seal population dynamics, which is why these simulations show the greatest effect. Sensitivity to misspecification in other demographic variables is largely a consequence of the effect of changing the value of a particular variable on the stable age structure used to initiate the iPCoD simulations - for example a population with a high adult survival rate will contain a larger proportion of adults and will therefore be more resilient and recover faster after disturbance. However, despite this complexity and variability, overall, the sensitivity to parameter misspecification is smaller than the variability among simulations, which results from the variability in expert's opinions on the degree to which vital rates are affected and the various forms of stochasticity (environmental and demographic) that contribute to the simulations. In addition, the sensitivity is only apparent at relatively high (and somewhat unrealistic) levels of impact, and therefore we conclude that the metric of counterfactual of population size is robust to misspecification in demographic rates. The final section of the report provides a table of recommended parameter values for modelling the impact of disturbance from offshore wind farm construction on UK marine mammal populations using iPCoD. Ultimately, it is the responsibility of the iPCoD user to justify the selection of demographic parameters, and new information may continue to become available from ongoing monitoring and modelling of these populations that may justify a different selection. We recommend that the choices for parameters are discussed and agreed with consultees before assessments are undertaken and we hope that the information presented in this report will guide these discussions. However, in the absence of estimates of demographic parameters, we highlight that, in general, adoption of a higher pup/calf survival rate and a lower adult survival and fertility rate will ensure the most precautionary predictive modelling outcomes.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,2043-7722,,,,,,,,,,,"Univ St Andrews, SMRU Consulting, St Andrews, Fife, KY16 8LB, United Kingdom",,,,2021-07-31,ZOOREC:ZOOR15708052450,,

MACMod is a 2D unsteady model dedicated to the atmospheric transport of marine aerosols in the Marine Atmospheric Boundary Layer (MABL). The model predictions were compared to aerosol size distributions measured during experimental campaigns conducted in the French coastal Mediterranean area, for various experimental conditions. The results show a good agreement between the model calculations and the experimental data. In addition, the influence of the main parameters governing the transport of sea-salts in the MABL in case of offshore winds is investigated using model calculations. In particular, our work allows quantification of decrease or increase in concentrations dependent on the thermal stability conditions (compared to neutral case). It is also found that the thermal stability has an increased effect for low wind speeds. The concentration at 10 m height of submicron and supermicron aerosols show an opposite behavior with regard to the stability conditions, i.e., concentration of the former is increased for stable conditions, whereas it is decreased for the latter. When the wind speed exceeds 15 ms(-1) the thermal stability effect is lowered. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

S. history. As part of the Natural Resource Damage Assessment process, we applied an innovative modeling approach to obtain upper estimates for occupancy and for number of manatees in areas potentially affected by the oil spill. Our data consisted of aerial survey counts in waters of the Florida Panhandle, Alabama and Mississippi. Our method, which uses a Bayesian approach, allows for the propagation of uncertainty associated with estimates from empirical data and from the published literature. We illustrate that it is possible to derive estimates of occupancy rate and upper estimates of the number of manatees present at the time of sampling, even when no manatees were observed in our sampled plots during surveys. We estimated that fewer than 2.4% of potentially affected manatee habitat in our Florida study area may have been occupied by manatees. The upper estimate for the number of manatees present in potentially impacted areas (within our study area) was estimated with our model to be 74 (95%CI 46 to 107). This upper estimate for the number of manatees was conditioned on the upper 95%CI value of the occupancy rate. In other words, based on our estimates, it is highly probable that there were 107 or fewer manatees in our study area during the time of our surveys. Because our analyses apply to habitats considered likely manatee habitats, our inference is restricted to these sites and to the time frame of our surveys. Given that manatees may be hard to see during aerial surveys, it was important to account for imperfect detection. The approach that we described can be useful for determining the best allocation of resources for monitoring and conservation.",,,,,,,,,8,0,0,0,8,0,8,,,1932-6203,,,,,,,,,,,"Fish & Wildlife Res Inst, Florida Fish & Wildlife Conservat Commiss, St Petersburg, FL 33701 USAUS Geol Survey, Patuxent Wildlife Res Ctr, Laurel, MD USAColorado State Univ, Dept Fish Wildlife & Conservat Biol, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USAVanderbilt Univ, Dept Biostat, Nashville, TN 37235 USAUniv Toulouse 3, Lab Stat & Probabilites, F-31062 Toulouse, FranceN Carolina State Univ, Dept Forestry & Environm Resources, Raleigh, NC 27695 USADauphin Isl Sea Lab, Dauphin Isl, AL USAUniv S Alabama, Mobile, AL 36688 USASea Shore Alliance, Sarasota, FL USA",Sea Shore Alliance,,,2014-05-15,WOS:000333677000025,24670971,

Mortality rates for Red Snapper Lutjanus campechanus (n = 87) were estimated by telemetry from December 2005 to June 2009 in the northeastern Gulf of Mexico. At five separate sites an array of five receivers was deployed with one receiver at the center (reef) and four receivers placed 1,100m (or 420m) north, south, east, and west of center. These arrays enabled the direct estimation of fishing mortality, natural mortality, and emigration of acoustically tagged Red Snapper. Out of the 70 fish that remained after the 6-d recovery period, 19 were caught, 10 died naturally, and 27 emigrated from the 2-km-radius study sites. The Kaplan-Meier staggered-entry method was used to estimate survival from different mortality events, and survival was converted to instantaneous mortality rates. For all years combined, total mortality (95% confidence interval) was 0.39 (0.19-0.64), fishing mortality (F) was 0.27 (0.11-0.54), and natural mortality (M) was 0.11 (0.06-0.20). Each year estimated annual M increased, M = 0 in 2006, M = 0.19 (0.07-0.48) in 2007, and M = 0.21 (0.09-0.44) in 2008, while annual F rates decreased, F = 0.61 (0.16-1.67) in 2006, F = 0.22 (0.09-0.51) in 2007, and F = 0.14 (0.05-0.35) in 2008. Thus, in more recent years (2007-2008) M estimates were higher, while F estimates were lower than past estimates used in stock assessments (M = 0.1; F = 0.35). These decreasing rates of F over 2006-2008 suggests that in recent years restrictive management efforts have succeeded in reducing fishing mortality, and although M has increased it may have leveled off near M = 0.2 such that populations will continue to increase.

Since 1968, this pencil-beam radar was-according to its (military) capacities of surveillance and tracking-applied for two different tasks: (I) To record the intensity of migration at various heights (either based on densities recorded by conical scanning, or frequencies of passage recorded with fixed beams at various elevation angles); densities (birds km(-3)) and frequencies (birds km(-1) h(-1)) are averages per height intervals of 200 m and do not refer to the position of single targets; they are suited to show average height distributions. (II) Tracking individual birds or flocks provides information on the exact position and flight behaviour of single targets over time. Part I: 16 (among 22) study sites with data from 1991 onwards are chosen to visualize and explain the vertical distribution of nocturnal bird migration according to regionally shaped environmental conditions in the Western Palaearctic and in the trade-wind zone. Average distributions at sites devoid of important orographic or persistent meteorological distortions usually show 20-30% of nocturnal migration in the lowest 200-m interval, 50% below 700 m above ground level (agl), and the 90% quantile reaching heights between 1400 and 2100 m agl. The remaining 10% of migrants are usually scattered up to about 4000 m above sea level (asl). The lower parts of migration are forced upwards when crossing mountain ridges and often remain high after such crossings; at subsequent observation points, migration is often high above ground. Particularly high altitudes prevail where wind conditions are improving with altitude, as e.g. during spring migration in the trade-wind zone. Part II deals with the seasonal and diurnal variation in the spatial distribution of particular bird targets. Birds were on average higher up at night compared to daytime and avoided flights close to the ground in hot desert areas. Highest flights were recorded during diurnal migration above desert areas. The highest 0.3% of the tracked birds were found between 3500 m and 4900 m asl at most sites, but at 5000-6870 m in spring migration of the Mediterranean and the trade-wind zone. The most extreme tracks were at altitudes between 4500 and 6600 m asl above the European mainland, and between 6000 and nearly 9000 m above the Balearic Islands and in the trade-wind zones. A concluding discussion deals with the reasons for generally low flight levels and the particular conditions and requirements of high-altitude migration. Flight conditions in the lower atmosphere deteriorate with altitude. Cost of climbing may impose additional restrictions (specifically for large non-passerines). Decreasing oxygen density imposes limits to high-altitude flight, and compensatory ventilation may induce increased water loss, if no physiological countermeasures are available. High flights are compulsory when crossing high mountain ranges and favoured when wind support increases with altitude. This is particularly true when long non-stop flights lay ahead, when turbulences and/or high temperatures at lower levels can be avoided, and possibly when time for homeward flights in spring can be minimized.",,,,,,,,,35,0,0,0,35,0,41,,,0021-8375,1439-0361,,,,,,,,,,"Swiss Ornithol Inst Schweizer Vogelwarte, Seerose 1, CH-6204 Sempach, Switzerland",,,,2018-04-01,WOS:000428955900001,,

Three observers use dictaphones to make continuous recordings of all animals sighted within three predefined bands on both sides of a twin-engined high-winged aeroplane. The aeroplane moves forward along parallel line transects at an altitude of 250 feet (78 m) and a speed of 100 knots (180 km/h). The distance between transects is 2 to 5 km. A GPS-datalogger collects information regarding time and position every 5 seconds along the flight track. A GIS Program will then assign every observation with a geographical position, which will be linked to the time of sighting. The distribution pattern of animals are presented by point maps. The application of this method to the west of the island of Sylt showed a large scaled distribution of important species like di- vers and harbour porpoises. Even within the 2.500 km2 wide study area there was no constant local concentration of these species and no gradient pattern appeared. Aerial surveys have following advantages: 1)A picture of the actual distribution of animals within a very large area can be obtained. This makes it possible to gain a value for parts of the covered area by comparing the distribution of animals. 2) It is possible to obtain values for parts of the covered area for special species without analysing uncertain density values. 3)The method has no influence on the distribution of animals (eg. certain species are prone to following ships) 4) Sea and weather conditions must be good and constant for the method to be used. This makes the data easy to compare between flights. 5) This method is very quick and flexible. Even a short time with good conditions can be used and areas far away from the coast can be reached very quickly.Following disadvantages of this method exist: 1)An exact determination of species is not possible for all species so that some species must be grouped together (eg. Redthroated and Blackthroated Diver; Guillemot and Razorbill) 2) There is only a limited data pool available for comparison. 3)The method can only be used under excellent weather conditions and there are only a few days in winter with such conditions. 4) Density values are hard to analyse and a calibration of this method with the ship surveys has as yet not been carried out. Aerial surveys have become a very important instrument for valueing marine areas with regards to planned offshore wind parks. Only this kind of survey makes it possible to get a small scaled distribution pattern of animals over a large area within a short time period.",,,,,,,,,9,0,0,0,12,0,13,,,0722-2947,,,,,,,,,,,"Bioconsult SH, Alte Landstr. 2, 25875 Hockensbuell, Germany",,,,2002-09-01,ZOOREC:ZOOR13800068886,,

However, to date, its interface behavior remains poorly understood. Thus, in this study, we used the Born-Oppenheimer molecular dynamics (BOMD) simulation method to explore the reaction mechanisms between Criegee intermediates (CIs) and methylsulfonic acid (MSA) at the air-water interface, then compared the observed behaviors with those in the gas phase. The addition of Criegee intermediates to MSA is nearly a barrierless reaction and follows a loop-structure mechanism in the gas phase. The high rate constants indicate that the Criegee intermediates and MSA reactions are the main acid removal channels. At the water's surface, the interaction of Criegee intermediates with MSA includes three main channels: 1) direct addition reaction, 2) H2O-mediated hydroperoxide formation, and 3) MSA-mediated Criegee hydration. These reaction channels follow a loop-structure or a stepwise mechanism and proceed at the picosecond time-scale. The results of this work broaden our understanding of Criegee atmospheric behaviors in polluted urban and marine areas, which in turn will aid in developing more effective pollution control measures.

The relevance of the research of methane seeps is due to their important role as a source of methane - greenhouse and environment-forming gas - for water column and atmosphere. The article presents a comparative analysis of the data from our biogeochemical 10-year studies of shallow gas seeps of the Crimean Peninsula and data on deep-sea gas seeps of the Black Sea. During 10-year period, apart from carrying out hydroacoustic research, the following parameters were determined: bubble gas component composition, methane carbon isotopic composition, microbial community structure of bacterial mats, covering gas bubble emission sites, and gas fluxes from separate seeps. During longterm monitoring, 14 separate gas bubble emission sites were detected and described in Crimean coastal areas; they were located from Cape Tarkhankut in the west of the peninsula to the Dvuyakornaya Bay in the southeast. Crimean coastal seeps were mostly of biogenic origin, with a seasonal nature of gas bubble emission. Laspi Bay seeps were classified as emissions of deep gas of thermocatalytic genesis. A significant variation was recorded in values of isotopic composition of methane carbon delta C-13-CH4 of bubble gas in coastal shallow areas (-94...-34 parts per thousand), which indicates different conditions for bubble gas generation and maturation in seabed sediments. Similar to deep-sea seeps, coastal gas bubble emissions were accompanied by bacterial mats of diverse structure, with different dominating species. As shown, formation of stable bacterial biomass, usually consisting of sulfide- and sulfur-oxidizing bacteria, requires a fluid flux of reduced dissolved gases, while pointwise bubble gas discharge does not provide sufficient concentration gradients and can mechanically disrupt community structure. Various methods were used to estimate the size spectra of bubbles, as well as fluxes from separate seeps. Gas flux values varied from 1.8 L-day(-1) (the Martynova Bay) to 40 L-day(-1) (the Laspi Bay). The environmentforming effects, related to gas bubble emission in coastal areas, are discussed: effect of seeps on oxygen conditions in seabed sediments and in water column above gas emission sites, vertical water mixing due to gas lift effect, and fluid discharge at gas emission sites.",,,,,,,,,4,0,1,0,1,0,5,,,2499-9768,2499-9776,,,,,,,,,,"RAS, AO Kovalevsky Inst Biol Southern Seas, Sevastopol, Russia",,,,2021-02-04,BCI:BCI202100191860,,

However, the presence of local magnetic field anomalies caused by geological formations such as volcanic rock and temporal fluctuations from solar storms could complicate its use in some high-latitude areas of the North Pacific Ocean. We assessed the potential value of adding geomagnetic data to a depth-based state-space model for geolocation of demersal fishes in Glacier Bay National Park, USA, a high-latitude magnetic anomaly area. We developed a high-resolution (100 m) magnetic field map of the study area and assessed in situ tag resolution by deploying 5 geomagnetic archival tags on a stationary mooring for 8 months. We compared performance of 4 theoretical geomagnetic tag measurement resolutions (low=1000 nT, medium=500 nT, high=+/- 300 nT, and very high=+/- 150 nT), 2 map resolutions (coarse- or fine-scale), and 5 methods of geomagnetic variance specification by estimating locations of simulated random walk trajectories under the different treatment scenarios using a hidden Markov model.Results Geomagnetic data improved model performance for both fine-scale and coarse-scale magnetic maps when tag resolutions were medium to very high and geomagnetic variance specification was based on error between measured and mapped values instead of study area attributes such as slope or roughness. Overall, the best model performance was observed for the highest tag resolution, the fine-scale map, and variance based on anomaly magnitudes. However, the coarse-scale map with a constant variance of 165 nT resulted in improvements over depth alone for all tag resolutions. In situ testing of mooring data suggests that the precision of the geomagnetic archival tags was comparable to the low and medium tag measurement resolutions tested in simulations, but variation in performance was high among tags.ConclusionsOur results suggest that inclusion of geomagnetic data could improve geolocation of demersal fishes in the North Pacific Ocean, but improvements to geomagnetic tags and additional information on magnetic field values measured at the seafloor compared to the sea surface are needed to ensure its utility.",,,,,,,,,4,0,0,0,4,0,4,,,,2050-3385,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Alaska Fairbanks, Coll Fisheries & Ocean Sci, 17101 Point Lena Loop Rd, Juneau, AK 99801 USAKingfisher Marine Res LLC, 1102 Wee Burn Dr, Juneau, AK 99801 USAInt Pacific Halibut Commiss, 2320 Commodore Way, Seattle, WA 98199 USANOAA, Natl Marine Fisheries Serv, Alaska Sci Ctr, 7600 Sand Point Way Northeast, Seattle, WA 98115 USAUniv Alaska Fairbanks, Coll Fisheries & Ocean Sci, POB 757220, Fairbanks, AK 99775 USA",Kingfisher Marine Res LLCInt Pacific Halibut Commiss,,,2020-06-02,WOS:000696387700001,,

Lungs and swim bladders have different ontogenetic origins and can be used either for buoyancy or as an accessory respiratory organ. Therefore, the presence of air-filled bladders or lungs in different groups of fishes is an example of convergent evolution. We propose that air breathing could not occur without the presence of a surfactant system and suggest that this system may have originated in epithelial cells lining the pharynx. Here we present new data on the surfactant system in swim bladders of three teleost fish ( the air-breathing pirarucu Arapaima gigas and tarpon Megalops cyprinoides and the non-air-breathing New Zealand snapper Pagrus auratus). We determined the presence of surfactant using biochemical, biophysical, and morphological analyses and determined homology using immunohistochemical analysis of the surfactant proteins (SPs). We relate the presence and structure of the surfactant system to those previously described in the swim bladders of another teleost, the goldfish, and those of the air-breathing organs of the other members of the Osteichthyes, the more primitive air-breathing Actinopterygii and the Sarcopterygii. Snapper and tarpon swim bladders are lined with squamous and cuboidal epithelial cells, respectively, containing membrane-bound lamellar bodies. Phosphatidylcholine dominates the phospholipid (PL) profile of lavage material from all fish analyzed to date. The presence of the characteristic surfactant lipids in pirarucu and tarpon, lamellar bodies in tarpon and snapper, SP-B in tarpon and pirarucu lavage, and SPs ( A, B, and D) in swim bladder tissue of the tarpon provide strong evidence that the surfactant system of teleosts is homologous with that of other fish and of tetrapods. This study is the first demonstration of the presence of SP-D in the air-breathing organs of nonmammalian species and SP-B in actinopterygian fishes. The extremely high cholesterol/disaturated PL and cholesterol/PL ratios of surfactant extracted from tarpon and pirarucu bladders and the poor surface activity of tarpon surfactant are characteristics of the surfactant system in other fishes. Despite the paraphyletic phylogeny of the Osteichthyes, their surfactant is uniform in composition and may represent the vertebrate protosurfactant.",,,,,6th International Congress of Comparative Physiology and Biochemistry6th International Congress of Comparative Physiology and Biochemistry,"FEB 02-07, 2003FEB 02-07, 2003",,"MT BULLER, AUSTRALIAMT BULLER, AUSTRALIA",58,0,0,0,50,0,68,,,1522-2152,1537-5293,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Adelaide, Sch Earth & Environm Sci, Adelaide, SA 5005, AustraliaUniv British Columbia, Dept Zool, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z4, CanadaInst Nacl de Pesquisas da Amazonia, BR-69083 Manaus, Amazonas, BrazilUniv Calgary, Dept Physiol & Biophys, Calgary, AB T2N 4N1, CanadaUniv Queensland, Dept Anat & Dev Biol, Sch Biomed Sci, St Lucia, Qld 4072, AustraliaUniv Auckland, Dept Zool, Auckland, New Zealand",,,,2004-09-01,WOS:000225504400004,15547792,

In this paper, we propose an algorithm for detecting cold upwelling signal based on daily merged sea surface temperature (SST) data with a multi-scale segmentation method. The upwelling area and intensity variation reflect a complete process of upwelling off eastern Hainan Island. Analyses on SST images in recent decade demonstrate that the upwelling did not exist daily during summer; instead, it occurred with a mean time interval of 6 days. Colder signature of upwelling events appeared for approximately 98 days on average in every summer from June to September. The mean values of cold area and intensity are 7698 km(2) and 1.0 degrees C, respectively, which are highly correlated. The frequency of upwelling occurrence is inversely proportional to the offshore distance, and the northeast is a high-frequent area.

The mechanism arises from the joint effects of organism behavior and the wind-driven response of a surface-trapped plume of fresh water originating from riverine sources. During upwelling-favorable winds, the plume thins vertically and extends offshore; downwelling winds thicken the plume and confine it to the nearshore region. In the western Gulf of Maine, the offshore extent of the river plume during upwelling conditions is sufficient to entrain upward-swimming A. fundyense cells germinated from offshore cyst beds.

Fish congregate around drilling platforms, which attracts fishing vessels that may illegally breach the 500 m safety perimeter. The objective of this study was to identify the fleets that frequent the safety zone of a platform and their behavior and to determine if there was a seasonal relationship in this interaction, during two exploration campaigns, in different periods, carried out on the Ocean Star platform in the Espirito Santo Basin. The results indicated a high incidence of artisanal fishing vessels inside the prohibited area, and of uncooperative behavior on the part of the boat crews. The statistical method of Factorial Correspondence Analysis distinguished vessels that were using pelagic longlines to fish for dolphinfish, registered in the state of Espirito Santo and longer than 11 m, which operated during the summer campaign. Vessels fishing for scombrids, which were less than 11 m long and registered outside Espirito Santo, were prominent in the autumn-winter campaign. In conclusion, the data showed that the fleets involved in each exploratory campaign were different, but to determine the real reason why the boats insist on frequenting the area close to the platform further study is necessary.

Two sets of RADARSAT-2 fully polarimetric SAR data are applied to test the validity of the developed method. The experimental results show that: (1) the convergence ability of optimized WNN can be enhanced, improving overall classification accuracy of ocean oil spill, in comparison to the classification results based on a common un-optimized WNN classifier; and (2) the joint use of the multiple fully Pol-SAR features as the inputs of the classifier can achieve better classification result than that only with single fully Pol-SAR feature. The developed method can improve classification accuracy by 4.96% and 7.75%, compared with the classification results with un-optimized WNN and only with one single fully polarimetric SAR feature.

Coastal ecosystems may be significant sources of greenhouse gases, including nitrous oxide (N2O) and methane (CH4) that have 300 and 25 times the global warming potential per molecule of carbon dioxide (CO2). Marine invertebrates, in particular, may produce GHGs in coastal ecosystems either directly or indirectly, through biogenic alteration of sediments, which expands the oxicanoxic interfaces in which microbes thrive. Anthropogenic nitrogen (N) loading and warming of coastal oceans may both enhance GHG production significantly. To test the hypothesis that numerically dominant coastal invertebrates, including a tube-building amphipod (Ampelisca abdita) and bivalves (Mytilus edulis, Mercenaria mercenaria, Geukensia demissa), can emit significant quantities of CO2, N2O , CH4, manipulative experiments will be performed. Potential emissions from each species, and subpopulations (along an existing nitrogen gradient in Narragansett Bay, RI), will be assayed under standardized conditions. To test how emissions from coastal invertebrates vary in response to anthropogenic fertilization and warming of the ocean, nitrogen and temperature will then be manipulated in mesocosm experiments. Fluxes and dissolved GHG concentrations will be compared across treatments. The abundance of two key potential mediators of GHG fluxes, ammonia-oxidizing and methane-oxidizing microbes, will also be characterized. These examinations will reveal functional consequences of ocean warming and fertilization, including the potential of coastal organisms to enhance global climatic feedbacks. The broader impacts involve broadening participation of under-represented groups in STEM. The principal investigator is committed to advancing science among all members of our diverse society. A graduate student will be recruited from a national diversity outreach program. Undergraduate researchers, via Summer Undergraduate Research Fellowships, will be mentored, and their contributions will be featured in new workshops that will be developed for high school students and teachers, and the National Society for the Advancement of Chicanos and Native Americans in Science. This project is supported under the NSF Ocean Sciences Research Initiation Grant (OCE-RIG) program, with goals to support novel research by early career scientists and increase the diversity of the U.S. ocean sciences workforce and research community.

These processes include the biotransformation and mineralization of numerous petroleum constituents. Thus, microbial communities in the Gulf of Mexico are thought to be responsible for the intrinsic bioremediation of crude oil released by the Deepwater Horizon (DM) oil spill. While hydrocarbon contamination is known to enrich for aerobic, oil-degrading bacteria in deep-seawater habitats, relatively little is known about the response of communities in deep-sea sediments, where low oxygen levels may hinder such a response. Here, we examined the hypothesis that increased hydrocarbon exposure results in an altered sediment microbial community structure that reflects the prospects for oil biodegradation under the prevailing conditions. We explore this hypothesis using metagenomic analysis and metabolite profiling of deep-sea sediment samples following the DWH oil spill. The presence of aerobic microbial communities and associated functional genes was consistent among all samples, whereas, a greater number of Deltaproteobacteria and anaerobic functional genes were found in sediments closest to the DWH blowout site. Metabolite profiling also revealed a greater number of putative metabolites in sediments surrounding the blowout zone relative to a background site located 127 km away. The mass spectral analysis of the putative metabolites revealed that alkylsuccinates remained below detection levels, but a homologous series of benzylsuccinates (with carbon chain lengths from 5 to 10) could be detected. Our findings suggest that increased exposure to hydrocarbons enriches for Deltaproteobacteria, which are known to be capable of anaerobic hydrocarbon metabolism.

The mound is located in the Green Canyon (GC) Block 185, adjacent to Jolliet Field in GC 184. Jolliet Field contains oil and gas that filled fault traps caused by salt deformation during late Pleistocene-Holocene time. In contrast to reservoir oil in Jolliet Field, which shows bacterial oxidation effects, the C-1-C-5 reservoir gas is unaltered by bacterial oxidation. Disassociated gas is assumed to have recently entered from the subsurface hydrocarbon system. Vertical migration of gas along faults is ongoing, manifested on the sea floor by gas vents, gas hydrate, complex chemosynthetic communities, and by a large gas plume that extends from the vents to the sea surface. The isotopic properties of C-1-C-5 hydrocarbons from reservoirs, gas vents, and gas hydrate correlate closely. Although outcropping gas hydrate is transiently stable because of variations in seawater temperature, the bulk of buried gas hydrate at GC 185 is stable and perhaps increasing in volume because of the copious gas flux, The massive accumulation of gas hydrate at the GC 185 site is attributed to the gas that has recently entered the vents, largely from Jolliet Field, and to the synchronous activation of fault conduits allowing gas migration to the sea floor. Synchronous late gas charge and faulting could also explain the wide distribution of gas hydrate across the upper Gulf slope. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Fleece-like microstructure attracted especially mussel larvae, however, most settled individuals lost attachment on this type of microstructure with increasing size during the time of experiment. Substrates with thick filaments and long and fixed appendices were less attractive to larvae but provided a better foothold for juvenile mussels as shown by the results of the dislodgement trials. In addition these appendices of substrates could interweave with the mussels, building up a resistant mussel/substrate conglomerate. Our results show that a mussel byssus apparatus can withstand harsh conditions, if suitable substrates are deployed. Depending on cultivation aims (seed or market sized mussels) and cultivation method (one or two step cultivation), different collector types for larval attraction, good foothold and interweaving abilities or collectors combining these properties should be developed and applied. The study suggests that substrates need to be very precisely tailored according to the major environmental conditions. Furthermore, the results imply that a one size fits all substrate may not be the most culture-effective approach, but, in the contrary, substrates need to be changed and modified according to the size of the mussel as they go through their different life cycle stages.

Linear as well as nonlinear stochastic wave loads are modeled in AQWA and subsequently fed into the finite-element model to assess the responses. The results indicate that the nonlinear wave loads could remarkably increase the dynamic responses of the internal base forces of bridge foundations as well as displacements of superstructures. The sum-frequency second-order components in nonlinear loads, though not large in magnitude, might overlap with the first few eigenfrequencies of the bridge and thus excite these modes and increase the responses.",,,,,,,,,50,4,0,0,0,0,52,,,0141-0296,1873-7323,,,,,,,,,,"Southwest Jiaotong Univ, Dept Bridge Engn, Chengdu 610031, Sichuan, Peoples R China",,,,2019-09-09,WOS:000482518700006,,
J,,,,,,,,,Maurizio Collu,,Investigation of the novel challenges of an integrated offshore multi-purpose platform,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Awarded Grant,Jul 31 2018,2018,"The Made in China 2025 report, highlights ocean renewable energy technologies as one of the 10 areas of opportunity for UK and Chinese companies. The Outline of the National Marine Economic Development Plan specifically targets the development of novel ocean farming methods, more productive but also more socially and environmentally compatible. In the EU, the Blue Growth program aims at sustainable growth in the marine and maritime sectors, already representing 5.4 million jobs and generating a gross added value of 500 billion euros a year. Offshore structures are very costly. The main idea of a Multi-Purpose Platform (MPP), integrating (for example) renewable energy devices and aquaculture facilities, is to find the synergies to share manufacturing, installation, operation and maintenance, and decommissioning costs.This has the potential to, save money, reduce the overall impact, and maximize the socio-economic benefits.MPP development poses cross-disciplinary challenges, since they simultaneously aim to achieve several potentially conflicting objectives: to be techno-economically feasible, environmentally considered, socially beneficial, and compatible with maritime legislations. In the EU, previous research focused on farms of multi-megawatt MPP (ocean renewable devices + aquaculture systems), with very few/no attempts to investigate lower rated power systems suitable for island/coastal communities. In China, previous projects aimed at island communities focused on renewable energy, but they did not integrate any aquaculture elements.Therefore, for island communities, novel fundamental questions arise, especially in terms of techno-economic feasibility and assessment and maximization of socio-environmental benefits at a completely different scale, but still requiring a whole-system, cross-disciplinary approach.The proposed solution is to investigate which are the specific challenges arising from the integration of these different offshore technologies, and with a multi-disciplinary approach to tackle them, making sure that all the dimensions (technological, economic, social, environmental, legal) are taken into account.The renewable energy technologies (Which wind turbine? Which wave device? What kind of solar panel?) and aquaculture systems most suitable for the needs of an island community will be identified, and the cross-disciplinary questions will be defined, e.g. What is the impact of the noise generated by the renewable energy devices on the (closely co-located) aquaculture species growth rate?.Answering these questions, the novel contribution will consist in developing approaches to assess the feasibility of an MPP system, focusing on: global MPP dynamic response to metocean conditions, overall integrated control and power management strategies, environmental impact, socio-economic risks and benefits.The potential of these methodologies will be then show-cased through two case-studies, one focusing on an island community in China, and one in the UK.This consortium brings together internationally recognised experts from three Chinese and three British universities and institutes, for a total of 20 investigators, in the fields of solar and offshore wind and wave energy, control systems for renewable energy devices, environmental and socio-economic impact of renewables and aquaculture systems, aquaculture and integrated multi-trophic aquaculture development, and ecosystem modelling.

The integrated history of the summer plankton blooms is preserved in the form of distinct plankton fossil assemblages and sediment facies, forming a continuous geologic record of wind-driven upwelling and thus changes in the SW monsoon winds. Sediments have been recovered from two regions in the NW Arabian Sea, one located along the Oman continental margin, and another located approximately 400 km offshore. Over the late Quaternary, these two sites record time series of upwelling that are substantially different. To understand the source of the differences, we examined the relationship between wind stress and upwelling at these sites using historical observations and model-simulated wind fields. In the coastal region, upwelling is directly related to the Ekman transport offshore, and is thus linearly proportional to the alongshore wind stress. Farther offshore, open-ocean upwelling is driven by the positive curl in the wind stress. In historical records, we found little correlation between stronger winds and increased open-ocean upwelling. In the region offshore where the sediment cores were recovered, the year with the strongest winds was accompanied by weaker wind stress curl and diminished upwelling (indicated by warmer sea surface temperatures and decreased phytoplankton pigment content) because the region of maximum wind stress curl moved NW that year. In atmospheric general circulation model experiments using a range of summer insolation forcing, we found large changes in the wind stress curl occur over some areas of the NW Arabian Sea; however the offshore core locations lies outside of the region where changes in the SW monsoon drive large changes in open-ocean upwelling. In contrast to the coastal sites where upwelling is directly related to the wind stress, the offshore sites appear to be located in a region where the wind stress curl does not change much over a large range of summer insolation. There is some evidence from both the interannual and model fields that this location is affected mom by movements in the position of the low-level jet than by changes in the over-all strength of the SW monsoon. Although more data are required to define these patterns, these results indicate that the time series of open-ocean upwelling observed in the geologic record from offshore sites may differ substantially from the coastal time series.",,,,,,,,,31,0,0,0,6,0,31,,,2169-9275,2169-9291,,,,,,,,,,"UNIV S CAROLINA, DEPT GEOL SCI, COLUMBIA, SC 29208 USABROWN UNIV, DEPT GEOL SCI, PROVIDENCE, RI 02912 USA",,,,1992-10-15,WOS:A1992JT99600002,,

Here, we test the influence of near shore winds, tidal currents and position of release (low, mid or high tidal zone) on the dispersal of drifting fucoid algae were tested. Drift sets (tagged Hormosira banksii, Durvillaea antarctica, Cystophora torulosa and GPS drifters) were tracked over single tidal cycles. Wind direction had the greatest effect on movement of drift sets, but interacted with tidal direction. Overall, offshore winds and outgoing tides were most favourable for LDD, but their effect differed between species. Approximately 90% of H. banksii, D. antarctica and GPS-tracked drifters were beach-cast after one tidal cycle during onshore winds, while 19% were beach-cast during offshore winds. In contrast, 50-75% of C. torulosa were beach-cast after one tide, regardless of wind direction. Displacement of drifters was affected by tidal zone of release, but interacted with wind and tidal direction. Drifting velocities varied between drifter types, with surface drifters travelling further and faster than the benthic-drifting species. Analysis of 20 years of wind data found seasonal differences in the percentage of hourly winds, with greater periods of south-westerly and north-westerly winds, and fewer onshore north-easterly winds, during autumn and winter periods. Conditions for successful offshore dispersal from the major algal dominated peninsulas of southern New Zealand are, therefore, more likely to occur if detachment of algae occurs during outgoing tides in autumn and winter.

Wind energy production has become an interesting option for alpine regions. In addition to grid reliability, public acceptance is an important factor that currently limits wind energy's market penetration.An interdisciplinary research team explored, through socio-economic and technical approaches, the current and future acceptance of wind energy production in the Swiss energy region of Goms, an alpine valley at 1300 m above sea level. The focus of this paper is on research questions comprising future societal challenges for the local population. For this purpose, the focus-group discussion has proven to be a valuable participatory method. Concerning future development of wind energy in the Alps, regional value creation (including workplaces) and the placement of systems where man-made infrastructure is already present were the main visions mentioned by workshop participants.So far, wind energy as implemented in the valley of Goms has not been perceived as a topic of conflict by the local community. Crucial components towards local acceptance of wind turbines are questions of aesthetics, technical performance and economic feasibility. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

The software is developed in the frequency domain, as a preprocessor of computing the wave excitation force, the added mass, and the wave radiation damping, for the input to a time-domain solver via the Fourier cosine and sine transforms. In addition, it can also predict the motion responses of a marine structure with sufficient accuracy, with or without the presence of a mooring system. Unlike other frequency-domain software, such as WAMITA (R) and HydrostarA (R), the present software currently employs the least squares method in association with a partially extended boundary integral equation method to remove the so-called irregular frequencies. Calculation of the free-surface Green's function employs a combination of fast-convergent series expansions in different parametric sub-regions. The solution of the resultant linear algebraic system employs the lower-upper (LU) decomposition method. Symmetry properties can be exploited, and the open multi-processing (OpenMP) parallelization technique can be applied to reduce the computation burden. The accuracy and the efficiency of the developed software are finally confirmed by numerical validations on three benchmark cases of a floating ellipsoid, a truncated circular cylinder and the OC4 DeepCwind semisubmersible floating wind turbine.

Fluctuations on these time scales are of particular relevance to the effective management of the power supply from large wind farms. The Hilbert-Huang transform (HHT) is shown to be an effective tool for analysing long time series of wind speed observations, as it describes the time-evolving spectral information in the time series. By binning and averaging the time-evolving spectrum, the average spectral behaviour of the wind speed under a certain class of conditions can be found. Here, the HHT is applied to create conditional spectra which demonstrate patterns in the occurrence of severe wind variability. It is shown that wind fluctuations over the North Sea are more severe for westerly flow than for easterly flow, and that severe fluctuations are often observed in the vicinity of precipitation. The most severe wind fluctuations occur in the autumn and winter seasons, and are slightly more common when the pressure tendency is rising. Further, it is found that the wind is more variable for atmospherically unstable conditions than for stable conditions.

In order to investigate reinvasion of the Saco mangrove creek (Inhaca Island, Mozambique) by crab megalopae, the timing and spatial distribution of settlement were related to major environmental forcing factors. Several sets of experiments were performed, with different specific objectives, using megalopal collectors. The total supply of brachyuran megalopae to the mangrove creek over a 2 mo period responded to 2 forcing factors, the first related to cycles of tidal amplitude and the second to offshore wind stress. The response of settlement on the collectors to the tidal amplitude cycle was reflected by clear maxima recorded on every spring tide. This contrasts with the results of previous studies analysing single species recruitment processes, which found a much more irregular pattern. This result was interpreted as a consequence of 2 factors: (1) the use of a cumulative number of total Brachyura, which increases the probability of detecting supply pulses, and (2) a larger tidal range at Inhaca than at the locations where most previous studies took place. The results of this experiment suggest interaction of the stochastic effect of offshore wind stress, which maximises transport to the coastal area, with the deterministic effect of the tide and spring-neap cycles, which operate at the nearshore level to carry megalopae to specific mangrove areas. Settlement was also studied by deploying collectors in 3 different strata of the mangroves, and the results showed a differential settlement distribution in favour of lower areas in the vicinity of the mangroves. This suggests subsequent juvenile migration to suitable areas following first moult.

Passive acoustic monitoring (PAM) is used worldwide to study potential impacts of marine industrial activities on cetaceans, but understanding of animals' site use at small spatiotemporal scales (< 1 km, < 1 day) remains limited. Small-scale variability in vocalising harbour porpoise (Phocoena phocoena) distribution within two Scottish marine renewable energy development (MRED) sites was investigated by deploying dense arrays of C-POD passive acoustic detectors at a wave energy test site (the European Marine Energy Centre [Billia Croo, Orkney]) and by a minor tidal-stream site (Scarba [Inner Hebrides]). Respective arrays consisted of 7 and 11 moorings containing two C-PODs each and were deployed for up to 55 days. Minimum inter mooring distances varied between similar to 300-600 m. All C-POD data were analysed at a temporal resolution of whole minutes, with each minute classified as 1 or 0 on the basis of presence/absence of porpoise click trains (Porpoise-Positive Minutes/PPMs). Porpoise detection rates were analysed using Generalised Additive Models (GAMs) with Generalised Estimation Equations (GEES).Although there were many porpoise detections (wave test site: N=3,432; tidal-stream site: N=17,366), daily detection rates varied significantly within both arrays. Within the wave site array (< 1 km diameter), average daily detection rates varied from 43 to 14.8 PPMs/day. Within the tidal stream array (< 2 km diameter), average daily detection rates varied from 10.3 to 49.7 PPMs/day. GAM-GEE model results for individual moorings within both arrays indicated linkages between porpoise presence and small-scale heterogeneity among different environmental covariates (e.g., tidal phase, time of day). Porpoise detection rates varied considerably but with coherent patterns between moorings only several hundred metres apart and within hours. These patterns presumably have ecological relevance.These results indicate that, in energetically active and heterogeneous areas, porpoises can display significant spatiotemporal variability in site use at scales of hundreds of metres and hours. Such variability will not be identified when using solitary moored PAM detectors (a common practice for site-based cetacean monitoring), but may be highly relevant for site-based impact assessments of MRED and other coastal developments. PAM arrays encompassing several detectors spread across a site therefore appear to be a more appropriate tool to study site-specific cetacean use of spatiotemporally heterogeneous habitat and assess the potential impacts of coastal and nearshore developments at small scales.

We used hydrocarbon profiles, stable isotopes, and high-density DNA microarray analysis to characterize microbial communities in produced water from four Alaskan North Slope hydrocarbon reservoirs. Produced fluids from Schrader Bluff (24-27 degrees C), Kuparuk (47-70 degrees C), Sag River (80 degrees C), and lvishak (80-83 degrees C) reservoirs were collected, with paired soured/non-soured wells sampled from Kuparuk and lvishak. Chemical and stable isotope data suggested Schrader Bluff had substantial biogenic methane, whereas methane was mostly thermogenic in deeper reservoirs. Acetoclastic methanogens (Methanosaeta) were most prominent in Schrader Bluff samples, and the combined delta D and delta C-13 values of methane also indicated acetoclastic methanogenesis could be a primary route for biogenic methane. Conversely, hydrogenotrophic methanogens (e.g., Methanobacteriaceae) and sulfide-producing Archaeoglobus and Thermococcus were more prominent in Kuparuk samples. Sulfide-producing microbes were detected in all reservoirs, uncoupled from souring status (e.g., the non-soured Kuparuk samples had higher relative abundances of many sulfate-reducers compared to the soured sample, suggesting sulfate-reducers may be living fermentatively/syntrophically when sulfate is limited). Sulfate abundance via long-term seawater injection resulted in greater relative abundances of Desulfonauticus, Desulfomicrobium, and Desulfuromonas in the soured lvishak well compared to the non-soured well. In the non-soured lvishak sample, several taxa affiliated with Thermoanaerobacter and Halomonas predominated. Archaea were not detected in the deepest reservoirs. Functional group taxa differed in relative abundance among reservoirs, likely reflecting differing thermal and/or geochemical influences.",,,,,,,,,30,0,0,0,26,0,30,,,1664-302X,,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Calif Berkeley, Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Div Earth Sci, Berkeley, CA 94720 USAEnergy Biosci Inst, Berkeley, CA USAUniv Illinois, Dept Geol, Urbana, IL 61801 USABP Explorat Co Ltd, Prod Chem, Anchorage, AK USAUniv Pacific, Ecol Engn Res Program, Stockton, CA 95211 USAUniv Tennessee, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Knoxville, TN USA",Energy Biosci Inst,,,2014-10-01,WOS:000341515900001,25147549,

Dominant AOA archetypes correlated with different geochemical factors, suggesting that different AOA are constrained by distinct parameters. Diversity was lowest after the hurricanes, showing weak resistance to physical disturbances. However, diversity was highest during the oil spill and coincided with a community shift, suggesting a new alternative stable state sustained for at least 1 year. The new AOA community was not significantly different from that at the spill site 1 year after the spill.

A continuous and strong BSR has been observed on seismic profiles from 300 to 500ms two-way-travel-time below the seafloor of this ridge. Sedimentary strata of the Formosa Ridge are generally flat lying which suggests that this ridge was formed by submarine erosion processes of down-slope canyon development. In addition, some sediment waves and mass wasting features are present on the ridge. Beneath the cold seep site, a vertical blanking zone, or seismic chimney, is clearly observed on seismic profiles, and it is interpreted to be a fluid conduit. A thick low velocity zone beneath BSR suggests the presence of a gas reservoir there. This gas reservoir is shallower than the surrounding canyon floors along the ridge; therefore as warm methane-rich fluids inside the ridge migrate upward, sulfate carried by cold sea water can flow into the fluid system from both flanks of the ridge. This process may drive a fluid circulation system and the active cold seep site which emits both hydrogen sulfide and methane to feed the chemosynthetic communities.",,,,,,,,,14,3,0,0,4,0,16,,,0025-3235,1573-0581,,,,,,,,,,"Acad Sinica, Inst Earth Sci, Taipei, TaiwanNatl Taiwan Univ, Inst Oceanog, Taipei, TaiwanNatl Inst Adv Ind Sci & Technol, Geol Survey Japan, Tsukuba, Ibaraki, JapanCPC Corp, Kaohsiung, TaiwanJAMSTEC, Kochi Inst Core Sample Res, Kochi, JapanJapan Agcy Marine Earth Sci & Technol, Yokohama, Kanagawa, JapanMinist Econ Affairs, Cent Geol Survey, Taipei, Taiwan",Minist Econ Affairs,,,2018-11-30,WOS:000450512900005,,

A detailed phylogenetic analysis of oil-degrading microcosms showed that known hydrocarbonoclastic organisms like Thalassolituus and Cycloclasticus, as well as proposed oil degraders like Roseobacter, were present at both 4 degrees C and 20 degrees C, demonstrating the thermo-versatility of such organisms. Clones related to Oleispira antarctica (98% 16S rRNA similarity), a psychrophilic alkane degrader, were dominant in the 4 degrees C oil-degrading community, whereas other clones constituting a different clade and showing 94% similarity 16S rRNA with O. antarctica were found in situ. These findings demonstrate the potential for intrinsic bioremediation throughout the course of the year in temperate estuarine waters, and highlight the importance of both versatile psychrotolerant and specialized psychrophilic hydrocarbon-degrading microbes in effecting this process at low temperatures.",,,,,,,,,167,11,0,0,149,1,202,,,1462-2912,,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Essex, Dept Biol Sci, Colchester CO4 3SQ, Essex, EnglandUniv Sheffield, Dept Anim & Plant Sci, Sheffield S10 2TN, S Yorkshire, EnglandHelmholtz Ctr Infect Res, Div Microbiol, D-38124 Braunschweig, Germany",,,,2007-01-01,WOS:000243294900025,17227422,

Korean government also have started a 10-year R&D project on CO₂ storage in sea-bed geological structure including gas field and deep saline aquifer since 2005. Various relevant researches are carried out to cover the initial survey of suitable geological structure storage site, monitoring of the stored CO₂behavior, basic design of CO₂transport and storage process and the risk assessment and management related to CO₂leakage from engineered and geological processes. Leakage of CO₂to the marine environment can change the chemistry of seawater including the pH and carbonate composition and also influence adversely on the diverse living organisms in ecosystems. Recently, IMO (International Maritime Organization) have developed the risk assessment and management framework for the CO₂sequestration in sub-seabed geological structures (CS-SSGS) and considered the sequestration as a waste management option to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions. This framework for CS-SSGS aims to provide generic guidance to the Contracting Parties to the London Convention and Protocol, in order to characterize the risks to the marine environment from CS-SSGS on a site-specific basis and also to collect the necessary information to develop a management strategy to address uncertainties and any residual risks. The environmental risk assessment (ERA) plan for CO2 storage work should include site selection and characterization, exposure assessment with probable leak scenario, risk assessment from direct and in-direct impact to the living organisms and risk management strategy. Domestic trial of the CO₂capture and sequestration in to the marine geologic formation also should be accomplished through risk management with specified ERA approaches based on the IMO framework. The risk assessment procedure for CO₂marine storage should contain the following components; 1) prediction of leakage probabilities with the reliable leakage scenarios from both engineered and geological part, 2) understanding on physio-chemical fate of CO₂in marine environment especially for the candidate sites, 3) exposure assessment methods due to CO₂leakage to various receptors in marine environments, 4) database production on the toxic effect of CO₂to the ecologically and economically important species, and finally 5) development of surveillance procedures on the environmental changes with adequate monitoring techniques.",,,,"이산화탄소를 포함하는 온실가스의 증가로 인한 기후변화 영향을 저감하기 위해 최근 이산화탄소의 포집 및 저장(CCS)과 관련된 많은 연구들이 이루어지고 있다. 포집된 이산화탄소의 저장은 저장용량이 큰 육상/해상의 유․가스전, 대수층, 석탄층과 같은 지질구조를 이용한다. 이산화탄소의 포집 및 저장과정에서 예상되는 가장 중요한 문제는 이산화탄소의 환경 중 유출에 의해 발생할 수 있다. 사업과정 또는 이후의 이산화탄소의 유출은 잠재적으로 환경 변화 및 서식 생물에 심각한 위해를 미칠 수 있는 것으로 우려된다. 저장된 이산화탄소의 유출에 의한 환경 위해를 최소화하고 과학적으로 관리하기 위해서는 환경위해성평가 결과를 바탕으로 위해도 저감 및 관리가 이루어져야 할 것이다. 위해성평가는 기본적으로 효율적인 위해도 관리를 위한 정책 결정 도구로 활용되며, 예상되는 위해요인과 인간 및 생태계에 미치는 영향과의 관계에 대한 신뢰성 있는 자료를 바탕으로 노출평가와 영향평가를 수행한 후 위해도를 산정하는 과정이다. 최근 국제해사기구(IMO)는 해저 지중저장 사업을 위한 위해성평가 체계에 대한 일반 지침서를 제시하였고, 모든 해저 지중저장 사업의 수행 주체는 이 지침서를 기본으로 사업 수행 전 과정에 대한 위해성평가관리 체계를 마련하도록 요구하고 있다. 이 지침서는 이산화탄소의 해저 지중저장에 대한 환경위해성평가는 저장 지역에 대한 특성파악, 유출시나리오에 기반한 노출평가, 누출된 이산화탄소에 의한 생물에 대한 직접적인 영향 및 환경 변화에 의한 간접적인 영향이 고려된 영향평가 등을 포함한다. 국내에서 시도되는 이산화탄소의 포집 및 해저 지중저장사업 또한 IMO의 지침서를 기반으로 하되 사업과 환경 특성에 적합한 위해성평가관리 시스템을 구축할 필요가 있다. 국내의 이산화탄소 해양 지중저장사업에 대한 위해성평가관리 체계 마련을 위해서는, 후보지역의 환경 특성에 대한 연구를 바탕으로 해양환경에서 이산화탄소의 물리화학적 거동에 대한 이해, 육상 및 해양환경의 배경 조건 및 특성 파악, 포집 후 수송, 지중저장 지질구조에 적합한 개연성 있는 유출시나리오에 기반을 둔 노출평가와 국내 생물종을 이용한 생태영향평가 자료의 생산과 DB화, 그리고 유출 감시 및 환경 모니터링 기법 개발 등이 반드시 이루어져야 한다.",,,,,3,0,0,0,0,0,3,,,2288-0089,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2009-01-01,KJD:ART001391876,,

The Outline of the National Marine Economic Development Plan specifically targets the development of novel ocean farming methods, more productive but also more socially and environmentally compatible. In the EU, the Blue Growth program aims at sustainable growth in the marine and maritime sectors, already representing 5.4 million jobs and generating a gross added value of 500 billion euros a year. Offshore structures are very costly. The main idea of a Multi-Purpose Platform (MPP), integrating (for example) renewable energy devices and aquaculture facilities, is to find the synergies to share manufacturing, installation, operation and maintenance, and decommissioning costs.This has the potential to, save money, reduce the overall impact, and maximize the socio-economic benefits.MPP development poses cross-disciplinary challenges, since they simultaneously aim to achieve several potentially conflicting objectives: to be techno-economically feasible, environmentally considered, socially beneficial, and compatible with maritime legislations. In the EU, previous research focused on farms of multi-megawatt MPP (ocean renewable devices + aquaculture systems), with very few/no attempts to investigate lower rated power systems suitable for island/coastal communities. In China, previous projects aimed at island communities focused on renewable energy, but they did not integrate any aquaculture elements.Therefore, for island communities, novel fundamental questions arise, especially in terms of techno-economic feasibility and assessment and maximization of socio-environmental benefits at a completely different scale, but still requiring a whole-system, cross-disciplinary approach.The proposed solution is to investigate which are the specific challenges arising from the integration of these different offshore technologies, and with a multi-disciplinary approach to tackle them, making sure that all the dimensions (technological, economic, social, environmental, legal) are taken into account.The renewable energy technologies (Which wind turbine? Which wave device? What kind of solar panel?) and aquaculture systems most suitable for the needs of an island community will be identified, and the cross-disciplinary questions will be defined, e.g. What is the impact of the noise generated by the renewable energy devices on the (closely co-located) aquaculture species growth rate?.Answering these questions, the novel contribution will consist in developing approaches to assess the feasibility of an MPP system, focusing on: global MPP dynamic response to metocean conditions, overall integrated control and power management strategies, environmental impact, socio-economic risks and benefits.The potential of these methodologies will be then show-cased through two case-studies, one focusing on an island community in China, and one in the UK.This consortium brings together internationally recognised experts from three Chinese and three British universities and institutes, for a total of 20 investigators, in the fields of solar and offshore wind and wave energy, control systems for renewable energy devices, environmental and socio-economic impact of renewables and aquaculture systems, aquaculture and integrated multi-trophic aquaculture development, and ecosystem modelling.

Offshore windfarms require construction procedures that minimize impacts on protected marine mammals. Uncertainty over the efficacy of existing guidelines for mitigating near-field injury when pile-driving recently resulted in the development of alternative measures, which integrated the routine deployment of acoustic deterrent devices (ADD) into engineering installation procedures without prior monitoring by marine mammal observers. 2. We conducted research around the installation of jacket foundations at the UK's first deep-water offshore windfarm to address data gaps identified by regulators when consenting this new approach. Specifically, we aimed to (a) measure the relationship between noise levels and hammer energy to inform assessments of near-field injury zones and (b) assess the efficacy of ADDs to disperse harbour porpoises from these zones. 3. Distance from piling vessel had the biggest influence on received noise levels but, unexpectedly, received levels at any given distance were highest at low hammer energies. Modelling highlighted that this was because noise from pin pile installations was dominated by the strong negative relationship with pile penetration depth with only a weak positive relationship with hammer energy. 4. Acoustic detections of porpoises along a gradient of ADD exposure decreased in the 3-h following a 15-min ADD playback, with a 50% probability of response within 21.7 km. The minimum time to the first porpoise detection after playbacks was > 2 h for sites within 1 km of the playback. 5. Our data suggest that the current regulatory focus on maximum hammer energies needs review, and future assessments of noise exposure should also consider foundation type. Despite higher piling noise levels than predicted, responses to ADD playback suggest mitigation was sufficiently conservative. Conversely, strong responses of porpoises to ADDs resulted in far-field disturbance beyond that required to mitigate injury. We recommend that risks to marine mammals can be further minimized by (1) optimizing ADD source signals and/or deployment schedules to minimize broad-scale disturbance; (2) minimizing initial hammer energies when received noise levels were highest; (3) extending the initial phase of soft start with minimum hammer energies and low blow rates.",,,,,,,,,7,0,0,0,3,0,7,,,,2688-8319,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Aberdeen, Sch Biol Sci, Lighthouse Field Stn, Cromarty IV11 8YL, Ross, ScotlandCtr Environm Fisheries & Aquaculture Sci, Lowestoft, Suffolk, England",,,,2020-12-01,WOS:000798015600013,,

Snails were placed in chambers containing either unoiled or oiled laid over vegetation to represent a heavily impacted marsh habitat, with unoiled vertical structure at one end. In the first movement assay, snail movement to standing unoiled vegetation was significantly lower in oiled chambers (oil thickness approximate to 1 cm) compared to unoiled chambers, as the majority(similar to 75%) of snails in oiled habitats never reached standing unoiled vegetation after 72 h. In a second movement assay, there was no snail movement standing unoiled structure in chambers with oil thicknesses of 0.1 and 0.5 cm, while 73% of snails moved in unoiled chambers after 4h. A toxicity assay was then conducted by exposing snails to oil coated Spartina stems in chambers for periods up to 72 h, and mortality was monitored for 7 days post exposure. Snail survival decreased with increasing exposure time, and significant mortality (similar to 35%) was observed following an oil exposure of less than 24 h.

In addition, wave energy converters (WECs) are being evaluated for more extensive use in coastal and deeper waters, most of which also require anchoring to the seabed. Since these systems must be moored, heavy anchors and typically heavy chain are used to secure the mooring and measurement/WEC buoy to the seabed. Disadvantages of present mooring technology include 1) damage to the seabed and benthic communities in vicinity of the mooring, as chain sweeps over the sea bottom; 2) an unnecessarily large watch circle at the water's surface; 3) slightly increased likelihood of marine mammal entanglement; 4) mooring damage from nearby fishing activity; and 5) likelihood of mooring failure due to self -entanglement within the mooring itself. This study presents an alternative mooring using mechanically compliant, elastomeric hoses to connect the buoyed system to the bottom anchor. Modeling the two mooring types with a typical buoy used in wind resource assessments shows a significant decrease in anchor drag area and surface watch circle with the use of the elastomeric hose versus the traditional chain and polyethylene line mooring. The hose also is equipped with copper conductors and/or fiber-optic conductors, providing power and data transmission between the bottom and the surface. For WEC solutions, the elastomeric hose provides similar benefits as for FLS and environmental monitoring systems, with the added advantage of being able to transmit power to the seafloor for distribution. For one WEC application, we have developed an elastomeric solution containing not only larger copper conductors to enable power transmission but also fiber-optic conductors to permit data transfer from a garage mounted on the bottom (servicing an autonomous underwater vehicle [AUV] or unmanned underwater vehicle [UUV], for instance) to the surface buoy for onward transmission to shore.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,0025-3324,1948-1209,,,,,,,,,,"EOM Offshore LLC, 20 Jonathan Bourne Dr, Pocasset, MA 02559 USAOcean Tech Serv LLC, Pocasset, MA USAEOLOS Solut, Barcelona, Spain",EOM Offshore LLCOcean Tech Serv LLCEOLOS Solut,,,2021-02-03,WOS:000607452200007,,

Among the reasons given is inadequate information on the wind resource potential at the selected site. This stresses the need for a thorough resource evaluation before a wind project is actually implemented. This chapter carries out a wind resource assessment of two sites in Viti Levu using 10-min interval data over a 2 year period obtained from the Fiji Meteorological Services.Considering the mean wind speed, Rakiraki seems to be a more viable option for commissioning a wind farm over Yaqara with a higher wind speed of 6.19 m/s. However, this information is not enough for determining the best site. Thus, the capacity factor (CF) values for two different turbine models were computed by deriving the best probability distribution function (PDF) equation. Out of the three PDFs (Weibull, Gamma and Lognormal) that were tested, the best fit to the observed data was provided by the Weibull distribution. Other criteria, including power output, annual energy production (AEP), cost saved (FJD), cost of electricity (COE) produced and payback period were all evaluated as part of a techno-economic assessment to select the better site out of the two.The results attained revealed that the Vestas V27 model for Rakiraki had the higher CF of 0.304. As for the output power and energy, the Vergnet 275 model for Rakiraki produced the higher values of 73.41 kW and 610,896.38 kWh, respectively. In general, the COE (FJD/kWh) and the payback period for Rakiraki were lower than those for Yaqara. However, for Rakiraki the Vergnet 275 model witnessed a slightly higher COE and payback period over the Vestas V27 model. Moreover, it is clear that Rakiraki is the more viable site for commissioning a wind farm over Yaqara (with AEP estimate of 22,603.17 MWh for the 37 Vergnet turbines). Also, while Vergnet would be more suited for Rakiraki in terms of AEP, cost saved and emission savings of 15,374.5 tCO(2) (when replaced with IDO) and 15,272.4 tCO(2) (when replaced with HFO), it also needs to be considered that the COE and payback period of the same model would be slightly higher over Vestas.This research would be of fundamental importance to policy makers as an aid to formulating a well-planned policy relating to wind energy, thus enabling the usage of a broader range of RE resources.",,,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,,,1574-0919,,978-3-030-30211-5; 978-3-030-30210-8,,,,,,,,,"Univ Fiji, Sch Sci & Technol, Dept Sci, Lautoka, Fiji",Univ Fiji,,,2021-08-01,WOS:000674776900009,,

The rocks can be divided into three types, including clastic rock, clastic rock-limestone and limestone- siliceous rock, and four fundamental ecological types and four fossil assemblages are recognized in the Wujiaping Stage. Based on a petrological and palaeoecological study, six single factors were selected, namely, thickness (m), content (%) of marine rocks, content (%) of shallow water carbonate rocks, content (%) of biograins with limemud, content (%) of thin-bedded siliceous rocks and content (%) of deep water sedimentary rocks. Six single factors maps of the Wujiaping Stage and one lithofacies palaeogeography map of the Wujiaping Age were composed. Palaeogeographic units from west to east include an eroded area, an alluvial plain, a clastic rock platform, a carbonate rock platform where biocrowds developed, a slope and a basin. In addition, a clastic rock platform exists in the southeast of the study area. Hydrocarbon source rock and reservoir conditions were preliminarily analyzed based on lithofacies palaeogeography. Sedimentary environments have obvious controls over the development of the resource rocks. With regard to the abundance of organic matter, the hydrocarbon potential of the coastal swamp environment is the best, followed by the basin environment and the carbonate rock platform.

GeoChip also provided useful information about the dynamics of functional genes involved in important geochemical processes in oil-contaminated sites, such as carbon (C), nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P) and sulfur (S) cycling. The relationship between the abundance of microbial functional genes and oil contamination and other environmental variables was also examined by GeoChip.

Conflicts are associated with impacts of existing and planned projects on wildlife, and associated difficulties of prediction where impacts are subject to considerable uncertainty. Many post-construction studies have demonstrated adverse effects on individuals of various bird and bat species. These effects may come in the form of collision-induced mortality or behavioral or physiological changes reducing the fitness of individuals exposed to wind energy facilities. Upscaling these individual effects to population impacts provides information on the true value of interest from a conservation point of view. This paper identifies methodological issues associated when moving from individual effects to population impacts in the context of wind energy. Distinct methodological approaches to predict population impacts are described using published case studies. The various choices of study design and metrics available to detect significant changes at the population level are further assessed based on these. Ways to derive impact thresholds relevant for decision-making are discussed in detail. Robust monitoring schemes and sophisticated modelling techniques may inevitably be unable to describe the whole complexity of wind and wildlife interactions and the natural variability of animal populations. Still, they will provide an improved understanding of the response of wildlife to wind energy and better-informed policies to support risk-based decision-making. Policies that support the use of adaptive management will promote assessments at the population level.

The mean received behavioral response threshold SPL of a harbor porpoise responding to the sounds and an acoustic dose behavioral response relationship were established. Two behavioral parameters were recorded during test and control sessions: (1) the harbor porpoise's respiration rate and (2) its distance from the transducer. Compared to in the control periods, the harbor porpoise's respiration rate increased significantly in test sessions at mean received SPLs of 104 dB re 1 mu Pa and above. The harbor porpoise's distance from the transducer was significantly greater during test sessions than during control sessions when mean received SPLs in test sessions were 86 dB re 1 mu Pa and above, indicating that it responded to the APD-01 primarily by swimming away from it. Because of the high frequency of the APD-01 sounds, harbor porpoises can determine the location of the sound source relatively easily. To calculate the effective deterring range of the APD-01 for harbor porpoises at sea, information on the behavioral threshold SPL for distance (established in the present study), the source level, and modeled information on the local propagation conditions and ambient noise need to be combined. The distance at which the APD-01 sounds are effective as deterrents is sufficient for their use to prevent PTS in wild harbor porpoises due to sound from the first strike of offshore pile driving.",,,,,45th Annual Symposium of the European-Association-for-Aquatic-Mammals (EAAM)45th Annual Symposium of the European-Association-for-Aquatic-Mammals (EAAM),"MAR 08-11, 2017MAR 08-11, 2017",,"Genova, ITALYGenova, ITALY",6,0,0,0,6,0,6,,,0167-5427,,,,,,,,,,,"Sea Mammal Res Co SEAMARCO, Julianalaan 46, NL-3843 CC Harderwijk, Netherlands",Sea Mammal Res Co SEAMARCO,,,2017-11-19,WOS:000412134900002,,

Until now, remote sensing platforms for oil spills, despite substantial records of past use, have been used as little more than spotter aircraft that supplemented reports from an observer with a camera and sketchpad, With the integration of image processing technology, multiple sensors and aircraft avionics, spill surveillance, usually limited to descriptions about the general size and approximate location of a patch of oil, can now provide quantitative information about the physical aspects of an entire spill and an understanding of its behavior over time, within the environment surrounding the spill. The ability to detect and measure changes relating to the characteristics of a spill itself, as well as the surrounding environment, marks the beginning for new commercial opportunities and applications of remote sensing technology-oil spill detection being just one example.

Variation in interclick intervals (ICIs) can be used to distinguish different acoustic behaviours. So far, studies on ICI variation are mostly descriptive and the behavioural context in which certain click train patterns are emitted is poorly understood.In this study, the behaviour of free-ranging porpoises was quantified by using typical ICI patterns known from the literature. These were recorded using two T-PODs deployed at a wind farm site (Nysted, Denmark) between 14 June and 12 July 2005 and during the entanglement of a porpoise calf in a gillnet (Clayoquot Sound Canada). It was possible to distinguish between feeding, approach behaviour and communication and known ICI patterns associated with these behaviours were used to categorise acoustic data.During feeding typical click trains start with long ICIs (30-70ms) and end with ICIs down to about 2ms. In a transition phase ICIs rapidly decrease. Click trains attribtued to feeding were found in the wind farm data at a rate of 6.3d (1) (n=174) with a patchy distribution. We found 20 to 74s long click train sequences with ICIs gradually decreasing from a median of 72ms (range 34 to 143ms) down to 5ms at a rate of 1.6day (1) (n=45). This was interpreted as approach behaviour, in which the animal was acoustically 'locked on' to a reflective structure. Communication signals are built up of click trains with very short ICIs (<7.7ms). during the entanglement of a porpoise calf, three different call types were determined at a rate of 8.9min(-1) (n=89). One call with variable duration (100 to 890ms) and relatively stable ICIs as low as 3.6ms resembled 'distress calls' described by Amundin (1991b). Another call type with durations from 780 to 830ms and ICIs ranging from 3.0 to 10 ms and thus different with respect to ICI curve progression was found only three times. These had a U-shaped ICI curve, similar to an 'alarm' or 'fright' call described by Busnel and Dziedzic (1966). A third and previously unreporeted call is characterised by a long call duration (up to 1.270ms) and sometimes oscillating ICIs with an initial decrease from about 9ms to around 7ms and an increase towards the end.The data presented suggest that the T-POD is a promising tool for behavioural studies. It is possible to recognise certain acoustic behavioural categories described in the literature, but it is important to look at the temporal context with other vocalisations in T-POD data, such as ICIs of preceding click trains.",,,,,,,,,23,0,0,0,19,0,23,,,1561-0713,,,,,,,,,,,"Kuhlandweg 12, D-24326 Nehmten, Germany",,,,2008-09-01,BCI:BCI200900330867,,

However, temperature showed a limited influence on active community structure, and fertilization induced changes in the presence of crude oil only. Simpson's index decreased for total bacterial communities at all temperatures in the presence of crude oil and diesel, whereas a lower reduction was observed for active bacterial populations. In the presence of fertilizer, the diversity of the whole community approached control values after seven incubation weeks; this was not observed for the active bacterial community.

As a model, we investigated marine molluscs (Mytilus galloprovincialis) grown in the Adriatic Sea. We characterized histological sections from two organs (gonads and digestive glands) of molluscs collected during several surveys at different growth time and distance from gas extraction platforms. We evaluated the effects of nano-pollutants mostly on the local tissue structure by combining AFM microscopy with scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Furthermore, the AFM images allowed evidencing the presence of nano- or micro-sized structures that exhibit different nanomechanical properties compared to the rest of the tissue.

The soil resistance is modelled utilising the American Petroleum Institutebased cyclic p-y, t-z, and Q-z springs. A dynamic analysis is conducted in the time domain utilising the finite element method and considering stochastic ice loads. The influences of undrained soil strength and water depth on the dynamic behaviours of the bridge are systematically investigated.

These coastal polynyas are hotspots of sea ice production and the primary source regions of the bottom water in the global ocean. They also host high levels of biological activities and are the feeding grounds of Emperor penguins and marine mammals. The polynyas are a key component of the Antarctic coastal system and crucial for the survival of penguins and many other species. These features also differ dramatically from each other in timing of formation, duration, phytoplankton growth season, and overall biological productivity. Yet, the underlying reasons for differences among them are largely unknown. This project studies the fundamental biophysical processes at a variety of polynyas, examines the connection between the physical environment and the phytoplankton and penguin ecology, and investigates the mechanisms behind polynya variability. The results of this interdisciplinary study will provide a context for interpretation of field measurements in Antarctic coastal polynyas, set a baseline for future polynya studies, and examine how polynya ecosystems may respond to local and large-scale environmental changes. The project will include educational and outreach activities that convey scientific messages to a broad audience. It aims to increase public awareness of the interconnection between large-scale environmental change and Antarctic coastal systems.<br/><br/>The main objectives of this study are to form a comprehensive understanding of the temporal and spatial variability of Antarctic coastal polynyas and the physical controls of polynya ecosystems. The project takes an interdisciplinary approach and seeks to establish a modeling system centered on the Regional Ocean Modeling System. This system links the ice and ocean conditions to the plankton ecology and penguin population. Applications of the modeling system in representative polynyas, in conjunction with analysis of existing observations, will determine the biophysical influences of individual forcing factors. In particular, this study will test a set of hypothesized effects of winds, offshore water intrusion, ice-shelf melting, sea-ice formation, glacier tongues, and ocean stratification on the timing of polynya phytoplankton bloom and the overall polynya biological productivity. The project will also examine how changing polynya state affects penguin breeding success, adult survival, and population growth.

These plates are typically under compressive axial forces. Hence, one of the main mechanisms for failure and collapse of such structures is buckling of plates. Thus, for safe and secure design, buckling strength of plates should be evaluated. Finite element analysis techniques are perfect tools for this purpose because of the accuracy and flexibility for performing simulations with different variables. In this study, the strength of aluminum plates has been studied using finite element analysis software and it was tried to study the influence of variables such as initial imperfections, plate thickness and aspect ratio on plate strength. It was found that increase in the imperfection magnitude leads to a decrease in the strength of the plate. This is mostly noticed in thin plates because of the plate's stiffness reduction. Although the plate's aspect ratio has a slight effect on strength, it has a considerable impact on the failure mechanism. In order to study a combination of plates and stiffeners buckling behavior, part of a high-aspect-ratio twin hull vessel hull structure is assessed under bending moment. It is observed that longitudinal stiffeners at the bottom of the hull in linear analysis undergo the maximum stress, while in non-linear analysis, the maximum stress is spread along with the structure of the deck and bottom, and neutral axis tolerates the minimum stress.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,1475-0902,2041-3084,,,,,,,,,,"Sharif Univ Technol, Dept Mech Engn, Azadi Ave, Tehran, Iran",,,,2019-09-16,WOS:000483861200001,,

Mean sea level and salinity are highest in summer and vary with seasonal water temperature and rainfall, whereas sea level variability and turbidity are highest in winter on account of storm effects.

The impact of these chemical changes depends on the considered organisms. In particular, it depends on the ability of the organism to control the pH of its inner fluids. Among echinoderms, this ability seems to differ significantly according to species or taxa. In the present paper, we investigated the buffer capacity of the coelomic fluid in different echinoderm taxa as well as factors modifying this capacity. Euechinoidea (sea urchins except Cidaroidea) present a very high buffer capacity of the coelomic fluid (from 0.8 to 1.8 mmol/kg SW above that of seawater), while Cidaroidea (other sea urchins), starfish and holothurians have a significantly lower one (from -0.1 to 0.4 mmol/kg SW compared to seawater). We hypothesize that this is linked to the more efficient gas exchange structures present in the three last taxa, whereas Euechinoidea evolved specific buffer systems to compensate lower gas exchange abilities. The constituents of the buffer capacity and the factors influencing it were investigated in the sea urchin Paracentrotus lividus and the starfish Asterias rubens. Buffer capacity is primarily due to the bicarbonate buffer system of seawater (representing about 63% for sea urchins and 92% for starfish). It is also partly due to coelomocytes present in the coelomic fluid (around 8% for both) and, in P. lividus only, a compound of an apparent size larger than 3 kDa is involved (about 15%). Feeding increased the buffer capacity in P. lividus (to a difference with seawater of about 2.3 mmol/kg SW compared to unfed ones who showed a difference of about 0.5 mmol/kg SW) but not in A. rubens (difference with seawater of about 0.2 for both conditions). In P. lividus, decreased seawater pH induced an increase of the buffer capacity of individuals maintained at pH 7.7 to about twice that of the control individuals and, for those at pH 7.4, about three times. This allowed a partial compensation of the coelomic fluid pH for individuals maintained at pH 7.7 but not for those at pH 7.4.

To study the interannual variability of suspended particulate matter (SPM) dynamics and their coupling with the variability in surface river water distribution on the Laptev Sea shelf, detailed oceanographic, optical (turbidity and Ocean Color satellite data), and hydrochemical (nutrients, SPM, stable oxygen isotopes) process studies were carried out continuously during the summers of 2007 and 2008. Thus, for the first time SPM and nutrient variations on the Laptev Sea shelf under different atmospheric forcing and the implications for the turbidity and transparency of the water column can be presented.The data indicate a clear link between different surface distributions of riverine waters and the SPM transport dynamics within the entire water column. The summer of 2007 was dominated by shoreward winds and an eastward transport of riverine surface waters. The surface SPM concentration on the southeastern inner shelf was elevated, which led to decreased transmissivity and increased light absorption. Surface SPM concentrations in the central and northern Laptev Sea were comparatively low. However, the SPM transport and concentration within the bottom nepheloid layer increased considerably on the entire eastern shelf. The summer of 2008 was dominated by offshore winds and northward transport of the river plume. The surface SPM transport was enhanced and extended onto the mid-shelf, whereas the bottom SPM transport and concentration was diminished. This study suggests that the SPM concentration and transport, in both the surface and bottom nepheloid layers, are associated with the distribution of riverine surface waters which are linked to the atmospheric circulation patterns over the Laptev Sea and the adjacent Arctic Ocean during the open water season.

This problem has recently surfaced as an important issue.Especially, Japan suffers from frequent and heavy lightning strikes, an example being the notorious winter lightning found in coastal areas of the Sea of Japan. Thus, it becomes more important to understand the grounding impedance characteristics of wind power generation from the viewpoint of lightning protection. As a report form IEC, TR61400-24, recommends a ring earth electrode, it seems not to be fully discussed and remains unresolved on transient behavior at a lightning strike.Therefore this report,, using a Finite Difference Time Domain (FDTD) Method, perform a electromagnetic transient analysis on a basement and ring earth electrode of a wind power generation in order to confirm the effect of the ring earth electrode. As the result of the analysis, it becomes clear that the ring earth electrode gives the lower steady impedance with less inductive voltage rise. Thus, it is confirmed that the ring earth electrode has certainly superiority for lightning protection.",,,,,41st International Universities Power Engineering Conference41st International Universities Power Engineering Conference,"SEP 06-08, 2006-2008SEP 06-08, 2006-2008",IEEEIEEE,"Newcastle upon Tyne, ENGLANDNewcastle upon Tyne, ENGLAND",4,2,0,0,0,0,6,,,,,978-1-86135-342-9,,,,,,,,,"Kansai Univ, Dept Elect Engn & Comp Sci, Yamate Cho 3-3-35, Osaka 5648680, JapanChubu Elect Power Co Inc, London, England",Chubu Elect Power Co Inc,,,2006-01-01,WOS:000256054900027,,

However, due to the lack of suitable measurements there is still a need for further validation for offshore sites. New data from ongoing measurements in the Danish Baltic Sea region are available now. The wind resources estimated from these measurements are compared to WAsP-predictions. They are found to agree well. The only deviation found is for two sites with comparable distance to the coast but with a different distribution of land. Here the measurements show slightly different wind resources, which are not predicted by WAsP. Wind speed ratios of several pairs of stations are modelled with WAsP for 12 directional sectors and compared with the measurements. Deviations in the directional wind speed predictions were found to correspond with the length of the sea fetch: For smaller sea fetches WAsP seems to slightly overpredict the wind speed, while for long fetches of more than 30 km an underprediction is found.

It is therefore critical to accurately quantify polynya dynamics to understand their spatial and temporal variability, particularly in the context of recent dramatic Arctic sea ice declines. In this study, the so-called erosion algorithm (a greyscale morphology image-processing technique) is applied to satellite-derived sea ice concentrations in the northern Bering Sea to investigate polynya dynamics throughout this region. Greyscale morphology allows for the estimation of sea ice extent with a defined error tolerance through the removal of regions with low sea ice concentrations in the marginal ice zone. Furthermore, since polynyas are the primary source of water within the sea ice pack, the presence of water here can therefore be utilized to define the areal extent of polynyas. We utilized AMSR-E (Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer-EOS) sea ice concentrations during January-April from 2003 to 2008 in the northern Bering Sea to extract daily time series of water area within polynyas by a water integration method after data are preprocessed using greyscale morphology techniques. These results compare well with those calculated by more traditional methods utilizing sea ice concentration thresholds and show the great utility of greyscale morphology techniques as a preprocessing method (which eliminates artificial determination of polynya areal extents and enables automation of the overall image-processing routine). In addition, based on the results of our algorithms we investigated the potential driving forces (e. g. offshore wind velocity) of polynya development in the northern Bering Sea as well as calculate the spatial and interannual variability of heat fluxes across these water surfaces owing to polynya formation.",,,,,,,,,3,5,0,0,0,0,8,,,0143-1161,1366-5901,,,,,,,,,,"Ocean Univ China, Coll Phys & Environm Oceanog, Qingdao 266100, Shandong, Peoples R ChinaClark Univ, Grad Sch Geog, Worcester, MA 01610 USA",,,,2012-05-02,WOS:000302162200012,,

For more than 10 years, Vestas has prepared LCAs of wind power. However, since 2010, a step change in comprehensiveness has been employed, for example, conducting the LCA to individually assess all components within a wind turbine (being composed of around 25,000 parts).Three LCAs have been conducted with the 2-MW GridStreamer(TM) turbines in accordance with ISO 14040/44 and critically reviewed by an expert. The goal was to evaluate potential environmental impacts and other non-impact indicators per kilowatt hour of electricity generated for a 'typical' 50-MW onshore wind plant.The LCAs assessed all life cycle stages and were built using GaBi DfX software. A significant quantity of primary data were gathered, for example, covering over 100 Vestas' sites for manufacturing, sales and servicing, as well as establishing turbine use-phase performance (i.e. electricity generation, servicing, etc.) based on over 20,000 monitored wind turbines around the world, covering around 20 % of the current worldwide installed capacity.The baseline results show that per kilowatt hour of electricity generated by the 2-MW GridStreamer (TM) turbines have the following baseline performance: ADP elements 0.44 to 0.58 mg Sb-e, ADP fossil 0.10 to 0.13 MJ; acidification potential 37 to 45 mg SO2-e, eutrophication potential 3.7 to 4.5 mg PO4-e, freshwater aquatic ecotoxicity 100 to 130 mg DCB-e, global warming potential 7 to 10 g CO2-e, human toxicity potential 1,150 to 1,400 mg DCB-e, marine aquatic ecotoxicity potential 1,100 to 1,300 g DCB-e, photochemical oxidant creation 4 to 5 mg ethene, terrestrial ecotoxicity potential 19 to 24 mg DCB-e, return-on energy 8 to 11 months and recyclability 81 to 85 % of turbine mass.Being equipped with extensive facts and comprehensive LCA models provides Vestas the basis to further integrate environmental considerations into product marketing, design and research, procurement and to deliver transparent information to stakeholders.Overall, the article presents a case study of the LCA approach used to assess the potential impacts of 2-MW GridStreamer (TM) turbines based upon comprehensive product knowledge and represents a state-of-the-art approach to LCA modelling of wind power.

Here, we report how the presence of amino acids in water induces changes in its structure and thus interrupts the formation of methane and natural gas hydrates. The perturbation of the structure of water by amino acids and the resulting selective inhibition of hydrate cage formation were observed directly. A strong correlation was found between the inhibition efficiencies of amino acids and their physicochemical properties, which demonstrates the importance of their direct interactions with water and the resulting dissolution environment. The inhibition of methane and natural gas hydrate formation by amino acids has the potential to be highly beneficial in practical applications such as hydrate exploitation, oil/gas transportation, and flow assurance.

This exploration is hampered by the lack of high band width communications. Radio waves do not propagate in sea water, and acoustic communication systems operate at relatively low bandwidth. Recent developments in blue/green semiconductor light sources suggest an alternative technology path to high bandwidth underwater optical communications. Intellectual Merit: The technical challenge of this proposal is to understand how the propagation of light underwater impacts optical communication system design and to develop methodologies to compute accurate communication link budgets for different ocean water conditions. To accomplish this, underwater optical communication systems will be built and tested in different water conditions. Understanding the role of absorption and scattering on the attenuation and dispersion of the signal is especially important to quantify. The scattering of light underwater also places special requirements on the dynamic range of the receiver, as well as the collection optics and pointing requirements. In addition to underwater optical communication links, short range optical wireless links integrated with solid state lighting systems and autonomous robotic vehicles will be considered. Broader Impact: High bandwidth underwater communications would be enabling for many scientific disciplines that investigate the ocean environment. Presently there is a proliferation of research that relies on autonomous underwater vehicles for data collection, and increasing numbers of people and robots work underwater, performing surveys, examining cables and pipelines, or working on oil rigs. Working underwater is dangerous and difficult and is consistently hampered by poor communications. The proposal also has a strong outreach component that involves numerous undergraduates in the underwater robotics club, and senior design program.

To date, five species of Culicoides are recorded in Reunion Island in which the first two are proven vector species: Culicoides bolitinos, C. imicola, C. enderleini, C. grahamii and C. kibatiensis. Meteorological and environmental factors can severely constrain Culicoides populations and activities and thereby affect dispersion and intensity of transmission of Culicoides-borne viruses. The aim of this study was to describe and predict the temporal dynamics of all Culicoides species present in Reunion Island. Methods Between 2016 and 2018, 55 biweekly Culicoides catches using Onderstepoort Veterinary Institute traps were set up in 11 sites. A hurdle model (i.e. a presence/absence model combined with an abundance model) was developed for each species in order to determine meteorological and environmental drivers of presence and abundance of Culicoides. Results Abundance displayed very strong heterogeneity between sites. Average Culicoides catch per site per night ranged from 4 to 45,875 individuals. Culicoides imicola was dominant at low altitude and C. kibatiensis at high altitude. A marked seasonality was observed for the three other species with annual variations. Twelve groups of variables were tested. It was found that presence and/or abundance of all five Culicoides species were driven by common parameters: rain, temperature, vegetation index, forested environment and host density. Other parameters such as wind speed and farm building opening size governed abundance level of some species. In addition, Culicoides populations were also affected by meteorological parameters and/or vegetation index with different lags of time, suggesting an impact on immature stages. Taking into account all the parameters for the final hurdle model, the error rate by Normalized Root mean Square Error ranged from 4.4 to 8.5%. Conclusions To our knowledge, this is the first study to model Culicoides population dynamics in Reunion Island. In the absence of vaccination and vector control strategies, determining periods of high abundance of Culicoides is a crucial first step towards identifying periods at high risk of transmission for the two economically important viruses they transmit.",,,,,,,,,8,0,0,0,7,0,10,,,1756-3305,,,,,,,,,,,"GDS Reunion, 1 Rue Pere Hauck, F-97418 La Plaine Cafres, La Reunion, FranceUniv Reunion Isl, 15 Ave Rene Cassin, F-97715 St Clotilde, La Reunion, FranceCIRAD, UMR ASTRE, F-97490 St Clotilde, La Reunion, FranceCIRAD, UMR ASTRE, Antananarivo 101, MadagascarUniv Montpellier, ASTRE, CIRAD, INRA, Montpellier, FranceInst Pasteur Mada gascar, Epidemiol & Clin Res Unit, Antananarivo, MadagascarFOFIFA DRZVP, Antananarivo, MadagascarCIRAD, UMR PBVMT, F-97410 St Pierre, La Reunion, FranceCIRAD, UMR TETIS, F-97490 St Clotilde, La Reunion, FranceUniv Montpellier, TETIS, Montpellier, FranceCIRAD, UMR ASTRE, F-34398 Montpellier, France",GDS ReunionInst Pasteur Mada gascarFOFIFA DRZVP,,,2019-12-19,WOS:000500981400002,31775850,

Plankton community structure did not undergo any changes. Only a few species were more abundant during spring 2003 than in previous years. No significant changes were detected in the planktonic community during productive periods, such as the spring bloom and the summer blooms related to intrusions of East North Atlantic Central Waters. The lack of evidence of the effects of the spill on planktonic communities is discussed in terms of the characteristics of the fuel, the high dynamics of the water masses, the biological mechanisms through which the fuel from the surface waters is transferred to the sea floor and, particularly, the influence of the natural variability by means of large and meso-scale hydrographic processes in the area under study. At the present time it is not possible to determine any minor effects the spill may have had on the plankton owing to the great variability of the planktonic cycles and the short-term impact of the oil from the Prestige on the pelagic system.

The field is divided into several provinces based on the distribution of gas and oil, and the gas and oil have been suggested to be cogenetic. The migration and filling model presented in this paper suggests that the oil and gas represent two different migration phases and that gas migration and filling predate oil emplacement. Two different oil populations have been characterized and mapped in Troll field applying conventional geochemical techniques. We suggest that the two oil populations migrated into the structure through two different migration systems. Oil and gas were subsequently biodegraded within the reservoir. The two oil populations have been found in neighboring oil and gas discoveries, and an oil-oil correlation with these discoveries has been used to determine the location of field filling points and regional migration routes. When oil biodegradation terminated, fresh oil continued to migrate into the reservoir and mixed with the residue of the biodegraded oil. The field was tilted downward to the west in the Neogene, and oil and gas remigrated within the field with a possible spillage of gas. Tilting resulted in a dominantly upward movement of the oil phase whereas gas migrated laterally.

This paper presents the results analyses of particular hypothetical oil spill scenario in Khark offshore oilfield which is one of the oldest discovered oil fields in Persian Gulf. Simulation of oil spill was carried out using MIKE21 model. After completion of simulation, it is safe to say that wind will play a vital role in advection and spreading of the oil slick in the sea. Tidal currents in the Persian Gulf have a Reciprocating motion which causes oil slick does not go far away. So, currents have negligible effect on advection and spreading of oil. The vast majority of spilled oil was evaporated in the first few days following a spill. The oil will pollute the marine environment by dispersing it in the water column and sedimentation on the sea floor.

Behavioral disturbance may occur up to 1 km around the device for harbor porpoises only. This is of little concern for a single turbine.

It does this by asserting that our presumptions about marine resources and the way in which they should be used are changing. Some emerging presumptions may not only preclude the use of existing technologies in some cases (e.g. dumping at sea), but may also act as drivers to the development of new technologies, such as offshore wave and wind power generation devices. A variety of maritime industries exploiting both living and non-living resources are examined individually. Attention is paid to marine conservation and the technologies that are important to providing generally for the protection of the marine environment. The authors conclude that major drivers will be ones for cleaner seas, for the development of renewable marine energy sources, and for the innovative management of the consequences of sea-level rise. With regard to the exploitation of living resources the finite limits to fisheries are stressed, and the present importance of industrial fishmeal supplies for salmon farming are highlighted. One of the greatest potential technological advances is predicted to be in marine habitat mapping. Given the changes in presumptions about our use of the seas, one over-riding conclusion is that the sustainable development of marine resources, and the conservation of priority habitats and species (for both the local seas and global oceans), must involve sustainable mechanisms for conflict resolution and decision-making.

A Bird Avoidance Model (BAM) is being developed in the Netherlands to reduce the risk of bird-aircraft collisions. In order to develop a temporally and spatially dynamic model of bird densities, data are needed on the flight-altitude distribution of birds and how this is influenced by weather. This study focuses on the dynamics of flight altitudes of several species of birds during local flights over land in relation to meteorological conditions.We measured flight altitudes of several species in the southeastern Netherlands using tracking radar during spring and summer 2000. Representatives of different flight strategy groups included four species: a soaring species (buzzard Buteo buteo), an obligatory aerial forager (swift Apus apus), a flapping and gliding species (black-headed gull Larus ridibundus), and a flapping species (starling Sturnus vulgaris).Maximum flight altitudes varied among species, during the day and among days. Weather significantly influenced the flight altitudes of all species studied. Factors such as temperature, relative humidity, atmospheric instability, cloud cover, and sea level pressure were related to flight altitudes. Different combinations of factors explained 40%-70% of the variance in maximum flight altitudes. Weather affected flight strategy groups differently. Compared to flapping species, buzzards and swifts showed stronger variations in maximum daily altitude and flew higher under conditions reflecting stronger thermal convection. The dynamic vertical distributions of birds are important for risk assessment and mitigation measures in flight safety as well as wind turbine studies.",,,,,,,,,54,0,0,0,45,0,59,,,0003-0007,1520-0477,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Amsterdam, Inst Biodivers & Ecosyst Dynam, NL-1018 WV Amsterdam, NetherlandsRoyal Netherlands AF, Sectie Nat Tech & Ecol Beheer, The Hague, Netherlands",Royal Netherlands AF,,,2006-01-01,WOS:000235140400015,,

However, the choice for a chemical or biological dispersant is still a controversial subject. Chemical surfactants that persist long in the environment may pose problems of toxicity themselves; therefore, biosurfactants are considered to constitute an environmentally friendly and effective alternative. Nevertheless, the putative effects of such agents on the microbiomes of oil contaminated and uncontaminated marine environments have not been sufficiently evaluated. Here, we studied the effects of the surfactant Ultrasperse II (R) and the surfactin (biosurfactant) produced by Bacillus sp. H2O-1 on the bacterial communities of marine water. Specifically, we used quantitative PCR and genetic fingerprint analyses to study the abundance and structure of the bacterial communities in marine water collected from two regions with contrasting climatic conditions. The addition of either chemical surfactant or biosurfactant influenced the structure and abundance of total and oil-degrading bacterial communities of oil-contaminated and uncontaminated marine waters. Remarkably, the bacterial communities responded similarly to the addition of oil and/or either the surfactant or the biosurfactant in both set of microcosms. After 30 days of incubation, the addition of surfactin enhanced the oil-degrading bacteria more than the chemical surfactant. However, no increase of hydrocarbon biodegradation values was observed, irrespective of the dispersant used. These data contribute to an increased understanding of the impact of novel dispersants on marine bacteriomes before commercial release into the environment. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Evidence of this early intrigue dates back to 130,000 BCE, but the advent of remotely operated vehicles (ROVs) in the 1950s introduced technology that has had significant impact on ocean exploration. Today, ROVs play a critical role in both military (e. g. retrieving torpedoes and mines) and salvage operations (e.g. locating historic shipwrecks such as the RMS Titanic), and are crucial for oil and gas (O& G) exploration and operations. Industrial ROVs collect millions of observations of our oceans each year, fueling scientific discoveries. Herein, we assembled a group of international ROV experts fromboth academia and industry to reflect on these discoveries and, more importantly, to identify key questions relating to our oceans that can be supported using industry ROVs. From a long list, we narrowed down to the 10 most important questions in ocean science that we feel can be supported (whole or in part) by increasing access to industry ROVs, and collaborationswith the companies that use them. The questions covered opportunity (e. g. what is the resource value of the oceans?) to the impacts of global change (e. g. which marine ecosystems are most sensitive to anthropogenic impact?). Looking ahead, we provide recommendations for how data collected by ROVs can be maximised by higher levels of collaboration between academia and industry, resulting in winwin outcomes. What is clear from this work is that the potential of industrial ROV technology in unravelling the mysteries of our oceans is only just beginning to be realised. This is particularly important as the oceans are subject to increasing impacts from global change and industrial exploitation. The coming decadeswill represent an important time for scientists to partner with industry that use ROVs in order to make the most of these ` eyes in the sea'. (C) 2018 Published by Elsevier B.

Finally, we have the transport of fouling from one biogeographical region to another. The rapidly rising world energy requirement, with platforms being built in different shipyards of the world, creates an artificial situation of a sessile benthic organism (biofouling) being transported from one ocean to another. These unintentional introductions of non-native aquatic organisms have resulted in the establishment of many species beyond their native ranges (Gollasch, 2002).Also, with the oil and gas industry going deeper, we have a completely new situation, which consists in artificial structures being placed in the deep blue. Normally, we would expect not much biofouling in the middle of the ocean, on the continental slope (deep sea); however, recent results have been showing that there is great growth of marine fouling attaching to the platforms and risers in the deep sea.In this chapter, we will discuss this new situation of offshore and deep-sea biofouling and its implications on operational and environmental aspects for the oil and gas industry.",,,,,,,,,21,0,0,0,6,0,21,,,,,978-1-84569-386-2,,,,,,,,,,,,,2009-01-01,WOS:000276378700006,,

The method is not time consuming to cover wide-range combinations of the incident angle and the period. Using this method, the hydroelastic behavior of the structure in oblique irregular waves is investigated. It is found that the high stress region is very sensitive for the variation of the wave direction and the period. The variance of the stress is dramatically reduced, if we take the effect of the wave short-crestedness into account. The estimation of the long term stochastic property and the fatigue damage assessment has been also performed. It is found that the wave short-crestedness plays an important roll to lower the fatigue damage.",,,,,Oceans 2007 Europe International ConferenceOceans 2007 Europe International Conference,"JUN 18-21, 2007JUN 18-21, 2007",,"Aberdeen, SCOTLANDAberdeen, SCOTLAND",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,978-1-4244-0634-0,,,,,,,,,"Osaka Univ, Dept Noval Architecture & Ocean Engn, Suita, Osaka, Japan",,,,2007-01-01,WOS:000253702200009,,

The development and implementation of ocean zoning, especially Marine Protected Area (MPA) networks, is expanding rapidly around the world. At a global scale, ocean zoning and MPAs are being pursued in many processes through a variety of governmental, inter-governmental (e.g. UN agencies, regional bodies), with significant input from non-governmental organizations (NGOs).Ocean industries, e.g. oil and gas, shipping, fisheries, aquaculture, etc. are the principle user group affected by ocean zoning. Important new ocean uses are under development as well, e.g. offshore wind, ocean energy, carbon sequestration. The creation of ocean zones, such as MPA networks, will have major effects on industry access to marine space and resources, with significant implications for exploration, development, production and transport.It is essential that the industry constructively engage with marine spatial management efforts and stakeholders to ensure that the process is well informed and balanced. This will increase the potential for industry to respect the management regulations of ocean areas often far removed from the reach of governments. Unfortunately, industry is often not present at key ocean zoning developments, especially at the international level, and is not engaged in a constructive, coordinated manner that brings together the range of industries operating in the marine environment.Barriers to industry involvement in marine spatial management include: 1) Lack of understanding of the movement and momentum behind ocean zoning efforts; 2) Limited engagement in the multi-stakeholder processes where zoning is moving most rapidly, e.g. Convention on Biological Diversity, because industry is engaged in sectoral processes; 3) Lack of means for engaging the broader ocean business community on marine management and sustainability issues, particularly at a global level.This paper will outline the need, opportunity and progress in creating proactive, constructive industry leadership and collaboration on ocean zoning, including: 1) Developing an understanding of marine spatial management issues, stakeholders and process; 2) Actively engaging in key international multi-stakeholder processes that are pursuing MPAs and other zoning efforts; 3) Building constructive relationships among ocean industries and other ocean zoning stakeholders; 4) Creating practical experience by constructively engaging in ocean zoning developments in a specific regions.",,,,,"28th International Conference on Ocean, Offshore and Arctic Engineering (OAME)28th International Conference on Ocean, Offshore and Arctic Engineering (OAME)","MAY 31-JUN 05, 2009MAY 31-JUN 05, 2009","ASME, Ocean, Offshore & Arctic Engn DivASME, Ocean, Offshore & Arctic Engn Div","Honolulu, HIHonolulu, HI",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,978-0-7918-4344-4,,,,,,,,,"World Ocean Council, Honolulu, HI 96815 USA",World Ocean Council,,,2009-01-01,WOS:000286404300142,,

Status of wind energy development in the countries of Greece, Albania, Montenegro, Bosnia-Herzegovina, and Croatia and regions of moderate and high wind potential at their west coasts were reviewed. The feasibility of the application of specific wind turbine generators with lower cut-in, cut-out, and rated speeds in moderate wind fields was investigated. The wind speed and direction as well as the availability, the duration, and the diurnal variation of several coastal sites in Western Greece were assessed, and the results were statistically analyzed as time-series or with the Weibull probability distribution function. The mean wind power densities were less than 200 W m(-2) at 10 m, suggesting the limiting suitability of the sites for the usual wind energy applications. However, further technical-economical analysis revealed that the recent technological turbine improvements with lower cut-in and rated speeds make wind power viable even at moderate wind fields. Environmental indicators like energy payback period and avoided greenhouse emissions were determined to be significant for the utilization of wind energy resources in these coastal areas.

This SAC extends from the inner firths to Helmsdale on the north coast and Lossiemouth on the south coast, and includes areas that are regularly used by the population of bottlenose dolphins occurring along the east coast of Scotland. As a result of this designation, Scottish Natural Heritage (SNH) has a responsibility to report on the condition of bottlenose dolphins within the Moray Firth SAC every six years. Since 1989, this population of bottlenose dolphins has been the focus of an intensive research programme, carried out by the University of Aberdeen in collaboration with the Sea Mammal Research Unit at the University of St Andrews. In 2004, SNH entered into a Memorandum of Agreement with the University of Aberdeen to support these photoidentification studies and use the data to report on the condition of the site. This report presents the results from the fifth round of SNH funded surveys, together with the results of similar surveys that were carried out with support from Beatrice Offshore Wind Ltd. (BOWL), Moray Offshore Renewables Ltd. (MORL), Marine Scotland, The Crown Estate and Highlands and Islands Enterprise. Data are incorporated into a revised assessment of the condition of this bottlenose dolphin population for this full site condition monitoring report. Main findings Mark-recapture analysis of photographs collected during photo-identification surveys indicated that the estimated number of individual dolphins using the SAC during the summer of 2016 was 103 (95% confidence interval: 93-115). Despite inter-annual variability, the number of dolphins using the SAC between 2001 and 2016 appears to be stable. A Bayesian capture-recapture assessment of the total abundance of the east coast bottlenose dolphin population indicates that this population is increasing. During the period 2001-2015, >50% of the population used the SAC in most years. Passive acoustic monitoring from 2011 to 2016 highlighted that there was inter-annual and seasonal variation in the amount of time and number of days dolphins spent at three long-term monitoring sites within the SAC. Results suggest this variation is site specific. Although, there was a summer peak in occurrence at all sites, dolphins were frequently present during most winter months. The quality of data available for completing the Site Attribute Table is high for attributes 1.1.1, 1.1.2 and 1.1.3. The following conclusions were reached Despite inter-annual variability, the number of dolphins using the SAC has remained stable. Additional data suggest that the population of dolphins on the east coast of Scotland is increasing, and the SAC is used by >50% of the population annually. The proportion of the east coast of Scotland bottlenose dolphin population that use the SAC has declined, most probably due to an overall increase in population size. Dolphins' occurrence at long-term monitoring sites shows site-specific inter-annual and seasonal variation. This pattern of use was broadly similar to those reported in previous site condition monitoring reports. Passive acoustic monitoring continues to suggest that dolphins may use certain areas of the SAC outside the summer months more than previously thought. The east coast of Scotland bottlenose dolphin population remains small and potentially vulnerable. Nevertheless, as a result of these data, we recommend that no change is made to the condition status (Favourable (recovered)).",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,1759-4014,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2019-03-28,ZOOREC:ZOOR15504019325,,

There has been recent progress applying this framework to the delivery of ecosystem services in land use planning. However, despite growing national and international interest in marine spatial planning, there is a lack of parallel frameworks in the marine realm. This paper reviews an ecosystem service tradeoff analysis framework and provides a more comprehensive synthesis for how it can be applied to marine spatial planning and marine ecosystem-based management. A tradeoff analysis approach can reveal inferior management options, demonstrate the benefits of comprehensive planning for multiple, interacting services over managing single services, and identify 'compatible' services that provide win-win management options.

Moreover, the rubber layer installed between the wall of CHFRF and the surrounding ground increases foundation flexibility and releases the larger overturning moment induced by wind. The rubber layer is made of alternately laminated rubber and steel. The objectives of this research are to study the lateral bearing behaviors of the CHFRF under monotonic and cyclic lateral loading in sand by model tests and FEM simulations. The results reveal that the CHFRF rotates during loading; and, in the ultimate state, the rotation center is located at a depth of approximately 0.6-0.65 times the foundation height and is 0.15-0.18 times the diameter of the foundation away from its centerline as well. The lateral bearing capacity of the CHFRF improves with the increase of embedded depth and vertical load applied to the foundation. Moreover, compared to the CHFRF without the rubber layer, the rubber layer can reduce the earth pressure along the wall of CHFRF by 22% and decrease the deformed range of the soil surrounding the foundation, revealing that it can reduce the loads transferred to the surrounding soil for extending the service life of the foundation. However, the thickness and stiffness of the rubber layer are important factors influencing the lateral bearing capacity and the energy dissipation of the foundation.

Slow injection of a 1-mu mol L(-1) DMS plume into the feeding current resulted in a characteristic behavioral pattern (tail-flapping), a redirection of flow equivalent to 30% of the average current velocity, and changes in the location of flow-induced vortices. In free-swimming individuals, this likely results in somersault-type movements that are associated with search behavior in copepods. In comparison to seawater controls, DMS injections significantly increased the average number of tail-flaps per copepod during the first 2 s after exposure to DMS gradients. Our results demonstrate that copepods can detect and react to plumes of DMS and suggest that this biogenic trace gas can influence the structure and function of pelagic foodwebs.",,,,,,,,,87,3,0,0,72,0,95,,,0024-3590,,,,,,,,,,,"Univ E Anglia, Sch Environm Sci, Norwich NR4 7TJ, Norfolk, EnglandUniv Groningen, Lab Plant Physiol, NL-9750 AA Haren, NetherlandsUniv Groningen, Dept Marine Biol, NL-9750 AA Haren, Netherlands",,,,2006-07-01,WOS:000239262200035,,

In this study we apply a numerical model to simulate hydrodynamics and waves in the Albemarle-Pamlico Estuarine System, a large and shallow back-barrier basin in eastern North Carolina, over a one-month study period (September 2008) with observations from several storm wind events of differing time scales and directions. Model performance is evaluated for a spatially varying wind field from the North American Regional Reanalysis (NARR) dataset in comparison to spatially uniform forcing from wind observations at offshore, coastal and land based sites across the region. A spatially uniform wind field from offshore winds observations results in statistically better hydrodynamic simulations of water levels (R = 0.88) in the estuaries than NARR (R = 0.48) after comparison with measurements and indicates the importance of strong marine winds over most of the estuary surface area. The influence of a prominent bathymetric feature on hydrodynamics in Pamlico Sound is also investigated by numerically removing a 30 km long and 2-3 m deep shoal from the model grid and replacing it with an idealized depth of 6 m. The removal of the shoal increases water level setup by 14% at the estuarine shoreline, decreases current magnitudes by up to 40% in the shoal region and increases significant wave heights locally by up to 25% in the sound, indicating the importance of this relict geomorphic feature as a major control on the hydrodynamic response of the system during wind events. The results suggest that increasing the water depth over the shoal can lead to higher storm surges and wave heights with the possibility of increased inundation and erosion of the back-barrier and mainland coastal regions. The complex bathymetry and marine wind influence are critical input conditions for modeling large and shallow lagoonal estuaries like the Albemarle-Pamlico Estuarine System. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

We calculate winds at turbine hub height for the sea breeze compared with synoptic winds and, for each type of site, we compare the seasonal and daily phase match to electrical load. To improve large-scale ocean power resource calculations, we derive an iterative algorithm to determine the surface roughness coefficient (z(0)). Our method calculates z(0) for specific times and locations over the ocean, rather than the prior practice of using a generic z(0) that is constant across time and space. Due to lower surface roughness of the ocean, wind speeds are notably higher at hub height, so that in the MAB we find that a representative open shelf site has three times the power content of a nearby land site. Regarding phase match to daily electric load, we find the sea breeze adjacent to the coast is a very good match to this region's electric power load profile. However, the open shelf wind speeds are so much higher (10.9 m s(-1) versus 5.7 m s(-1) for the comparison period) that the near-coast phase advantage is obviated. We also find more consistent wind power production offshore, with single sites producing at least some power 88 to 92% of the time.

This project uses a relatively simple method? comparison of the rank-order abundance of molluscan living and time-averaged death assemblages ?to establish an ecological baseline of oyster reef health. This approach has the advantage of providing a census of oyster reef communities in areas where conventional live-collected samples resulting from long-term monitoring efforts are sparse or unavailable. Such baseline information will allow us to move beyond the recognition of the immediate ecological changes resulting from the oil spill, by providing a unique perspective on the composition of pre-impact oyster reefs. This kind of information is not available from ?snapshot? baselines, such as those collected by many governmental and non-governmental agencies in response to the oil spill. This information provides much needed context for setting restoration goals. It also highlights the key role that geohistorical data have to play in conservation efforts. The results of this study provide critical baseline data needed to assess the impacts of the Deepwater Horizon oil spill on the ecology and structure of oyster reefs in the Gulf region. This study also serves as a foundation for future policy amendments and ensures our post oil spill conservation efforts more fully align with an ecosystem-based management approach that integrates and implements increased knowledge to improve management and policy decisions. While many existing conservation and management processes include aspects of a baseline assessment, most contingency efforts focus solely on a limited range of remedial management efforts. Missing from this picture is a more proactive process for more comprehensive recognition of human effects on marine ecosystems. For future ecosystem remediation efforts to be effective, a more holistic approach that incorporates and explicitly evaluates the historical diversity and abundance of our marine ecosystems will be required. This project provides a valuable example of such an approach. Results from this project will be widely disseminated both to the academic community and general public. In particular, two outreach projects will make the results accessible to broad audiences both locally and nationally. These projects build on recent outreach initiatives of the Paleontological Research Institution (PRI), which were a response to public requests for information on the ecological effects of the Deepwater Horizon oil spill. The first of these initiatives is a small temporary exhibit in PRI?s Museum of the Earth. The exhibit is based on specimens of modern marine invertebrates, especially corals and mollusks, from PRI?s extensive research collections. The second is a website (www.museumoftheearth.org/undersiege) explaining the diversity of marine invertebrates in the Gulf and Keys and why these species may be especially vulnerable to crude oil. These two vehicles will be used to present the results of this oyster reef project.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,1064259,,,,,,,,Paleontological Research Institute,Paleontological Research Institute,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:13757686,,

During the stratified season of a shelf sea, the coastal front is usually considered as a single front, i.e., the tidal mixing front. However, using high resolution (similar to 1 km) Multi-scale Ultra-high Resolution (MUR) analysis sea surface temperature (SST) data, this study observes persistent double fronts along the Yellow Sea coast in summertime. The double fronts comprise the well-known offshore tidal mixing front and a nearshore front, and the nearshore front has not been previously reported. The climatological (2002-2017) monthly mean result shows that the double fronts with two SST gradient peaks exceeding similar to 2 degrees C/100 km and opposite SST gradient directions basically remain unchanged from June to August, whereas the frontal spacing decreases in September. Analyses based on a two-layer concept model suggest that a topographic slope along with tidal mixing could induce the pattern of double fronts. The frontogenesis of nearshore thermal front could be associated with the different responses of the water column of different water depths to insolation. The offshore movement of the nearshore front in September could be related to the fast cooling of nearshore water and intensified offshore wind, and the topographic slope is important for determining the pattern of double fronts (loose or tight). This study shows a new pattern of coastal fronts in the stratified season, and indicates the significance of high resolution satellite data. The discovery of the double front pattern implies the influence of coastal fronts during the stratified season on marine ecology and environment in a shelf sea might be underestimated.",,,,,,,,,20,1,0,0,8,0,21,,,0278-4343,1873-6955,,,,,,,,,,"East China Normal Univ, State Key Lab Estuarine & Coastal Res, 500 Dongchuan Rd, Shanghai 200241, Peoples R ChinaOcean Univ China, Key Lab Marine Environm & Ecol, Minist Educ, Qingdao, Peoples R ChinaNorth Carolina State Univ, Dept Marine Earth & Atmospher Sci, Raleigh, NC USA",,,,2019-03-01,WOS:000461402200007,,

Subsequently, there has been a hike in fuel prices. Unfortunately, the planet is left to bear the brunt in form of pollution. These factors have put forward a pressing demand of research for eco-friendly and renewable resources. In this domain, tidal energy offers a promising future. Tides are produced due to the interactive orbital mechanics of solar & planetary systems. Security, diversity of supply, intermittence and predictability are few of the compelling factors in pursuit of tidal power. Tidal energy comprises of both kinetic and potential energy. The tidal stream technologies include a horizontal axis turbine and a vertical axis turbine. This study is focused on horizontal axis turbines. The horizontal axis marine turbine operates on same principles as wind turbines. The energy transformation process is quite simple. The turbine rotor is driven by the tidal current. The motion of the rotor converts mechanical energy into rotational energy. Gear box transmits shaft's rotational energy to generator which converts this energy into electricity. Shroud/ ducts/ diffuser are used to improve the efficiency of the horizontal axis marine turbine. Shroud/ ducts/ diffuser deploy diffuser and hydrofoil principles to accelerate water streamline. Power generated is proportional to cube to steam velocity. This paper aims at presenting a comprehensive review of the horizontal axis marine turbines.

This study provides new insights using daily 4-9 km resolution satellite and ocean reanalysis datasets in the period 2009-2015. A key purpose of this work is to highlight the value of these finely detailed products in coastal research. The most intense case of 23-24 January 2011 revealed a cold plume <10 degrees C extending offshore into a filament. SE winds accelerated cyclonically around Cape Town, and the enhanced wind vorticity lifted <10 degrees C water over the shelf. Yet a statistical analysis found that sea surface temperature and equatorward winds are correlated at <-0.10. A significant outcome could only be achieved in summer (December February) due to opposing thermal and kinematic influences. The intense upwelling of 23-24 January 2011 was supported by the approach of a midlatitude upper anticyclone and coupled shelf wave. Regression analysis over 2009-2015 showed that a warmer tropical SE Atlantic contributes to a trough over Namibia that spawns coastal lows. They advance southward toward Cape Town at 6-12 day intervals, pulsing the upwelling and turning the equatorward winds offshore and cyclonic. The strong pressure gradient, shallow marine layer, and steep mountains induce a Venturi effect and low level wind jet over the shelf edge. Leeward of Cape Town, a wind shadow and poleward currents contribute to phytoplankton blooms that support a rich ecosystem. In summary, the multiple factors of intense coastal upwelling at Cape Town include: (1) cyclonic wind shear over the shelf due to shallow equatorward flow obstructed by coastal mountains, (2) passing atmospheric coastal low and oceanic shelf wave from the large scale weather, and (3) passing oceanic anticyclonic eddy offshore shed by the Agulhas Current.",,,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,,,0749-0208,1551-5036,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Zululand, ZA-3886 Kwa Dlangezwa, South AfricaUniv Puerto Rico, Dept Phys, Mayaguez, PR 00681 USA",,,,2017-04-11,WOS:000397355700009,,

Particularly locations where oil based muds (OBM) had been used and discharged received attention. A general outcome of these studies was that 6 to 8 years after OBM cutting discharges elevated oil concentrations and associated biological effects still occurred within a few hundred meters from well sites. Although contamination levels generally seemed to have decreased compared to the situation shortly after drilling, it was argued that oil had not completely disappeared at any of the locations investigated, although there were clear signs of ecological recovery. Nevertheless it remained unclear to what extent recovery would continue at the longer term. Therefore the parties involved in the convenant between the Dutch government (represented by the Ministry of Transport and Public Works) and the oil companies (represented by NOGEPA) decided to continue monitoring sediment conditions at the long term. In spring 2005 a renewed monitoring exercise was carried out including sediment sampling near four well sites in the Dutch sector, where OBM cuttings had been discharged 18 to 21 years ago. The locations were situated in the southern erosion area (1 location), the northern sedimentation area (2 locations) and the transition zone in between (1 location) respectively. At each location a compendious survey was carried out, during which sediments were sampled at 5 stations between 25 and 1000 m from the discharge site. At three locations a production platform was present, the fourth location has been abandoned immediately after an exploration drilling had been finished. This location could possibly give an indication of the impact of beamtrawl fishing, which is not allowed within 500 m from platforms, on the longterm distribution of discharged material. At all locations chemical analyses were performed to assess oil concentrations in the sediment. These analyses were carried out and reported by TNO. For the platform locations a complete fauna analysis was carried out to detect possible effects on the macrobenthic community. For the abandoned well site only the numbers of sea urchins Echinocardium cordatum (an OBM sensitive species) in the samples were counted. In this report the results of the biological analyses are presented, whereas the results of the chemical analyses are shortly summarized. The results and conclusions of this study may be summarized as follows: 1. Platform L13-fe, erosion area: Slight contamination levels occurred up to at least 100 m, but to less than 250 m from the platform. Oil seems to have disappeared for the greater part after 18 years. 2. Platform L13-fe, erosion area: A clear effect on the benthic community could only be observed at the station nearest to the platform (40 m). Here the fauna was substantially impoverished. 3. Platform L13-fe, erosion area: The sea urchin Echinocardium cordatum seemed to be affected in its abundance up to 250 m from the platform. 4. Platform K12-a, transition zone: The sediment conditions seem to have considerably improved compared to the first 7 years after the discharges but slightly elevated oil concentrations occurred up to at least 100 m from the platform. Patchiness in the distribution of discharged material may have camouflaged the presence of local higher contamination levels. 5. Platform K12-a, transition zone: At 35 m from the platform the benthic fauna was clearly affected. The fauna composition at this station was different and substantially poorer than at stations further away from the platform. 6. Platform K12-a, transition zone: At 100 m the benthic community seemed to be only slightly affected. 7. Platform L4-a, sedimentation area: At stations 250 m and further away from the platform contamination seems to have decreased to values below background level. 8. Platform L4-a, sedimentation area: At 100 m oil concentrations in the superficial sediment layers (0 - 10 cm) had decreased to values just beyond background level. However in the deeper sediment layers no decrease was observed. 9. Platform L4-a, sedimentation area: At 100 m the fauna seemed to be not or hardly affected, in spite of the presence of oil in the sediment. 10. Platform L4-a, sedimentation area: At 45 m from the platform the sediment was severely contaminated. The oil concentration (32 g per kg dry sediment) was higher than ever measured near L4-a. The chromatogram of the sediment sample was different from those usually found near old OBM locations and indicated that the oil was not or hardly weathered. This has led to the idea that the oil could be rather 'fresh'. However, no recent source of contamination is known. It is argued that most probably anaerobic conditions have inhibited bacterial degradation and weathering of the OBM base oil, that was discharged here 19 years ago. 11. Platform L4-a, sedimentation area: At 45 m from the platform the benthic fauna was severely impoverished. Most species that were common or even abundant further away from the platform were absent or occurred in very low densities. 12. Location G13-1, sedimentation area, abandoned well site: A measurable effect of beamtrawl fishing on the distribution of discharged material could not be demonstrated. As a consequence of the very patchy distribution of the discharged material, a much more extensive sampling program would be necessary to detect such an effect. 13. After 20 years, oil contaminated surface sediments (top 10 cm) generally occur up to somewhere between 100 m and 250 m from platforms. The concentrations measured are slightly beyond background level, but give an underestimation of the contamination present, since oil usually accumulates in the deeper sediment layers. 14. Measurable effects on the macrobenthic community are generally limited to an area within 100 m from platforms after 20 years. 15. At the species level effects may occur in an area within 100 m to maximally 250 m from well sites.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,0923-3210,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2006-01-01,ZOOREC:ZOOR14306042663,,

Its coastline, which is characterized by the presence of ice-rich sediment (Ice Complex) and the vicinity of the Lena River Delta, retreated at a mean rate of 0.59 m/yr between 1951 and 2006. Total erosion ranged from 434 m of erosion to 92 m of accretion during these 56 years and exhibited large variability (sigma = 45.4). Ninety-seven percent of the rates observed were less than 2 m/yr and 81.6% were less than 1 m/yr. No significant trend in erosion could be recorded despite the study of five temporal subperiods within 1951-2006. Erosion modes and rates actually appear to be strongly dependant on the nature of the backshore material, erosion being stronger along low-lying coastal stretches affected by past or current thermokarst activity. The juxtaposition of wind records monitored at the town of Tiksi and erosion records yielded no significant relationship despite strong record amplitude for both data sets.

It explores the failure of the Bill to include marine protection of over 3,000,000 km 2 of the waters associated with overseas territories and Crown dependencies. It explains the necessity for close liaison with the European Commission and with the devolved administrations in Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales, where responsibility for marine governance is not clear cut. It expresses some disappointment in the failure of the Bill to cover questions of ownership of marine resources in particular the right to fish, which remains held under ancient and flawed common law rules. The paper then investigates the content of the Bill, looking at the role and functions of the Marine Management Organisation including licensing of fishing vessels, wind farm consenting/creation of safety zones, consents under the Wildlife and Countryside Act, research, advice, assistance, training, and prosecutions. The Bill also establishes a framework for marine planning with potential for the creation of marine plans and marine policy statements covering the waters of England and Wales to the edge of the UK Exclusive Economic Zone. Such plans and statements will have persuasive effects on the organisations involved in marine management, but will not be completely binding. The Bill creates powers to licence numerous activities and if necessary delegate licensing function to the bodies such as the Marine Management Organisation. It also established new powers for the creation of Marine Conservation Zones. The paper explores the narrow purposes for which these Marine Conservation Zones and created, and contrasts these unfavourably with the draft Scottish Marine Bill, which permits Marine Conservation Zones for such purposes as community interest. The paper also acknowledges that no target has been set for the creation of Marine Conservation Zones, and raises some concerns over whether Marine Conservation Zones contain severe enough penalties, particularly in respect of commercial fishing where there is a specific exemption for fisheries damage. The paper explores the function of the new Inshore Fisheries Authorities which will replace existing Sea Fisheries Committees, but raises concerns that the new organisations will still remain vulnerable to conflicts of interests because of their membership.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,2182-9446,,,,,,,,,,,"Univ West England, Sch Built & Nat Environm, Coldharbour Lane,Frenchay Campus, Bristol BS16 1QY, Avon, EnglandUniv Bristol, Law Sch, Bristol BS8 1RJ, Avon, England",,,,2009-08-01,WOS:000447447400003,,

The oil companies expected effects of their activities to be found to a 1 km radius round platforms. In the late 1980s data started appearing that suggested that effects were over much larger areas. These findings were disputed but subsequent studies showed that a more realistic figure of the area affected was a 3 km radius giving roughly 10 times the area predicted by the companies. The Norwegian authorities reacted by imposing restrictions on discharges of oil-based drilling cuttings and since 1993 oil-based drilling mud or cuttings have not been intentionally discharged to sea on the Norwegian shelf. In 1996 Norway changed its offshore monitoring from field based monitoring of sediments to a regional monitoring of both sediments and the water column, The change makes it possible to obtain a better overview of the environmental conditions, at the same time it also reduces costs for the operators.

An underwater sound model was developed to simulate sound propagation from marine and hydrokinetic energy (MHK) devices or offshore wind (OSW) energy platforms. Finite difference methods were developed to solve the 3-D Helmholtz equation for sound propagation in the coastal environment. A 3-D sparse matrix solver with complex coefficients was formed for solving the resulting acoustic pressure field. The complex shifted Laplacian preconditioner (CSLP) method was applied to solve the matrix system iteratively with Message Passing Interface (MPI) parallelization using a high-performance cluster. The sound model was then coupled with the Finite Volume Community Ocean Model (FVCOM) for simulating sound propagation generated by human activities, such as construction of OSW turbines or tidal stream turbine operations, in a range-dependent setting. As a proof of concept, the validation of the solver is tested with an ideal case against two other methods, and its application is then presented for two coastal wedge problems.

The research data was collected from both fishmeal and oil manufacturers (12) by using questionnaires and stakeholders of the industry via SWOT analysis. Research results showed that fishmeal and oil manufacturers produced 174 kg of fishmeal and 117 kg of fish oil by processing one ton of anchovy while that of sprat was 140kg and 40kg, respectively. Research results also showed that the strength of the fishmeal and oil sector were the short marketing channel and high profitability while the weaknesses were insufficient fish stock and difficulties in finding fish as a raw material. The most important opportunities and threats were the increasing demand for aquaculture and the lack of data about the stocks of anchovy and sprat, respectively. The four main problem areas in the sector are the difficulties in providing fish, the absence of an effective decision support system developed by using macro and micro level data, infrastructure problems and legislation issues. Contributions to the solution of the problems in this industry include the sustainable use of the fish stock in the Black Sea and increasing the amount of captured fish by focusing on international seas. In addition, designing an information system in the sector, the establishing of laboratories and the necessary facilities for compliance with the standards of food production, the implementation of filter systems for the odor problem, solving the electrical problems, and effective implementation of the legal regulations with the minimum height and catch quota, and the promotion of the qualifications of the managers may enhance the competitive power of the sector.",,,,,,,,,7,0,0,0,5,0,7,,,1303-2712,2149-181X,,,,,,,,,,"Ondokuz Mayis Univ, Dept Agr Econ, Samsun 55139, Turkey",,,,2016-03-02,WOS:000369639600007,,

Therefore, it is of great importance to evaluate the different impacts of such industries, in order to enable reasonable and sustainable decisions on environmental issues (e.g., nature conservation). Bottom trawling has a significant impact on benthic habitats worldwide. Fishing gear penetrates the seabed and the resulting furrows temporarily remain in the sediment known as trawl marks (TM), which can be recognized in the acoustic signal of side-scan sonars (SSS) and multibeam echo sounders (MBES). However, extensive mapping and precise descriptions of TM from commercial fisheries at far offshore fishing grounds in the German EEZ are not available. To get an insight into the spatial patterns and characteristics of TM, approximately 4800 km(2) of high-resolution (1 m) SSS data from three different study sites in the German EEZ were analyzed for changes in TM density as well as for the geometry of individual TM. TM were manually digitalized and their density per square kilometer was calculated. In general, TM density was highest in August and October. Moreover, different gear types could be identified from investigating individual TM in SSS data. Beam trawl marks were observed to have widths of up to 22 m whereas otter board marks showed widths up to 6 m. The persistence of TM was estimated to 2-7 days minimum for all three sites based on the SSS data from 2015-2019. A maximum persistence could be defined at one site (Dogger Bank) and it was five months for the investigation period 2016-2017. Besides the main factors driving TM degradation (wave-base impact, sediment-type), different methods for TM detection (SSS, MBES, under-water video) are discussed.

Recently, the later one, catenary mooring-line, is increasingly used in deeper water due to its lower cost and easier installment. As the floating platform are developed toward deeper water depth, the length of the mooring-line become larger and consequently the dynamic behaviors such as the structural inertia and hydrodynamic inertia/damping of the mooring-line become more obvious.In this paper, the dynamic behaviors of the mooring-line are considered, and compared with the traditional quasi-static method where only the static restoring force is involved, so as to comprehensively examine the non-linearly restoring performance of catenary mooring-lines. Firstly, the nonlinear dynamic model of the mooring system is developed based on our 3d dynamic catenary equations along with the modified finite element simulations. Compared with the static restoring force, essentially depending on structural gravity and overall shape based on static catenary theory, the dynamic restoring force is analyzed based on our 3d curved flexible beam approach where the structural curvature changes with its spatial position and time in terms of vector equations. In our modified finite element simulations, the rotation degree of freedom between neighboring beam elements is released and bending stiffness of individual element is set to be zero, and the statically original shape and top tension according to the traditional static catenary theory are used as the initial conditions. Moreover, the hydrodynamic force is loaded as depending on structural motion.Based on our numerical simulations, the influences of the amplitude and frequency of the catenary's top-end motion, along with the structural parameters (including the mass density and initial tension ratio), on mooring line's temporal spatial evolution of displacement and dynamic tension are studied. Also, the slack-taut phenomenon caused by structural /hydrodynamic inertia and damping are presented Our results show: 1) Generally, the displacement distribution along the mooring-line is characterized as a stable stand wave. The additional part of restoring tension due to the dynamic effects is up to 20% of the quasi-static method, and the tension amplitude difference (between the maximum tension and minimum tension) is around three times of the quasi-static value. Particularly, as the mooring-line becomes slack, the response is characterized as travelling wave, the maximum tension amplitude is up to 9 times of the static method. 2) As the amplitude/frequency of the catenary 's top-end motion increases, the value of catenary displacement firstly drops and then rises. The displacement distribution along catenary length changes with the motion of top end. Interestingly, the maximum displacements occur at the middle point of the catenary for case of surge while the maximum displacement moves up along the catenary as the top end motion gets larger for case of heave. 3) The magnification factor of top tension drops with increase of mooring-line mass density but rises with the increase of the initial tension ratio. It is also noted the velocity amplitude at higher frequency in the velocity spectrum may increase as the top end motion increases.",,,,,"36th ASME International Conference on Ocean, Offshore and Arctic Engineering36th ASME International Conference on Ocean, Offshore and Arctic Engineering","JUN 25-30, 2017JUN 25-30, 2017","ASME, Ocean Offshore & Arctic Engn DivASME, Ocean Offshore & Arctic Engn Div","Trondheim, NORWAYTrondheim, NORWAY",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,978-0-7918-5773-1,,,,,,,,,"AVIC Composite Corp LTD, Natl Key Lab Adv Composites, Beijing 100095, Peoples R ChinaChinese Acad Sci, Inst Mech, Key Lab Mech Fluid Solid Coupling Syst, Beijing 100190, Peoples R ChinaBeijing Univ Aeronaut & Astronaut, Sino French Engn Sch, Beijing 100191, Peoples R ChinaUniv Chinese Acad Sci, Sch Engn Sci, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China",,,,2017-12-27,WOS:000417225200021,,

The structure of the vinyl-containing epoxy resin prepolymers was characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and H-1 nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Morphology observations revealed that uniform sea-island phase separation structure was present in modified silicone rubbers. The compatibility between silicone rubber and epoxy resin was enhanced, thanks to the good dispersion of vinyl-containing epoxy prepolymers in silicone rubber matrix. The adhesion and tensile properties of modified silicone rubbers were greatly enhanced when compared with those of unmodified counterparts. The thermal degradation behavior of cured silicone rubbers was studied using thermogravimetric analysis and thermogravimetric/infrared spectrometry analysis.

A total of 27 eggs and I I larvae of R. laevis were captured respectively. Fish eggs were mainly distributed in the area 15 degrees 28.4'-16 degrees 17.3'S, 172 degrees 43.8'-173 degrees 29.0'E where the temperature and salinity were 25.72-26.22 degrees C and 35.10-35.32, respectively.

Abundance of fish eggs and larvae was 1-14 ind./100 m(3) and 1-3 ind./100 m(3), respectively. The distribution areas of fish eggs and larvae were located in the oceanic front. The R. laevis eggs were spherical in shape, 1.40-1.60 mm (1.50 +/- 0.054 mm, n=27) in diameter, and they contained 20 to 30 yellowish oil droplets of 0.06-0.16 mm (0.10 +/- 0.064 mm, n=27) in diameter. The eggs were buoyant, with a transparent, unsculptured egg chorion, and an unsegmented yolk. As the embryonic development processes reached to tail-bud stage, many melanophores had distributed on the dorsal surfaces of head, trunk and yolk sac. 20 pairs clearly distinguishable myotomes and the dermal sac were clearly seen. Before hatching, the dermal sac encased the entire embryo, except tail and pectoral fins. The dermal sac was densely covered with minute vesicles whose function was unknown. Newly hatched larvae possessed a dermal sac, which enclosed the head and trunk. The dermal sac was entirely collapsed at snout to anus length(SAL, the distance from the tip of the snout through the pectoral base to a vertical from the anus) 1.20 mm (1.80 mm TL and 1.68 mm BT). The body spines begun to decrease in size at SAL 3.20 mm (4.00 mm BT). Concurrently, the caudal fin fold degenerated and disappeared completely, the notochord atrophy was nearly complete, and the spines on the ventral midline became connected by extensions small spines, which develop into a ventral keel.

These include, among others, the development of wind farms located in the sea and increased numbers of underwater cables. The objective of this study was to determine whether a magnetic field (MF) of 10 mT or a 50 Hz electromagnetic field (EMF) of 1 mT affected the developmental instability of the inner ear organ, which is responsible in fish for hearing and balance, in rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) reared in a laboratory for 37 days (13 days in egg stage and 24 days in larval stage). This was done by analyzing the fluctuating asymmetry (FA) of otolith size. The MF and EMF values applied in this study are those recorded in the vicinities of underwater alternating current (AC) and direct current (DC) cables, respectively. The influence of MF on otolith FA was found to be statistically significant, with the highest significance occurring in the group of youngest larvae of 5 dph (compared to larvae 15 and 23 dph). Otolith FA was also higher in larvae exposed to the EMF compared to control conditions, but the differences were not statistically significant. Thus, we can conclude that underwater constructions and cables which emit a MF of 10 mT or higher can affect living organisms that are within a distance of a few meters, especially those (as in the case of trout) in settled life stages.

However, the non-availability of these renewable energy resources all the time throughout the year has led to research in the area of hybrid renewable energy systems. Since hybrid power systems are mostly used in remote areas where grid-connection may be unavailable; these systems must be self-sufficient in frequency and voltage control. In this paper, other power elements are introduced to provide reliable service to the system load and simulated the wind turbine generator with DL showing graphs for frequency, voltage and active and reactive power for the elements of the system. These elements are called balancing mechanisms, as they balance the system's power output to match the load consumption. Fuel Cells, batteries, dump loads (DL), and fossil fuel based generation have been used as balancing mechanisms. Hybrid power system is simulated and the performance analysis is done in a user friendly MATLAB/Simulink environment.

This approach benefits from the simplicity of a 1D network within the estuarine and irrigation systems, while maintaining the interaction with the spatial tidal dynamics of the 2DH coastal domain. First, the role of the irrigation system on tidal dynamics is quantified; then, tidal propagation, freshwater budget, and the effect of offshore subtidal water level on discharge division are investigated. The results show that the complex irrigation system, in a friction-like manner, reduces the tidal amplitude up to 25%. The channels aggregate to 1% of the total water volume in the delta, while accommodating up to 10% of the tidal prism. Tidal amplitude reduces upstream, while subtidal water level is highly sensitive to upstream discharge, spring-neap cycles, and wind-generated offshore surge. Although cumulative discharge division within the estuarine network is consistent, temporal discharge division can be significantly sensitive to offshore wind-surge.

The investigation aimed at evaluating average wind speed for the most promising sites. Moreover, the possible amount of captured energy for each site is determined. Average and r.m.s. values of power are calculated in order to determine the power form factor. These parameters at any site are essential for choosing the appropriate wind turbine. The assessment reveals that these remote sites offer sufficient wind energy for economic utilization and represent a good example for utilizing wind energy to supply a part of the energy requirements to those communities. The design of a wind chart is presented in detail.

However, little is known about right whale occurrence along the mid-Atlantic US migratory corridor. A better understanding of right whale occurrence in this region is needed prior to offshore wind energy development activities, which may increase mortality risks and chronic impacts on the population. We conducted an 11 mo passive acoustic survey along coastal North Carolina and Georgia near several wind energy areas to document the acoustic occurrence of right whales in the southern region of the mid-Atlantic US coast. Right whales were acoustically detected across all seasons, with peak seasonal presence occurring during autumn in the Georgia site and during winter in the North Carolina site. A secondary peak in presence also occurred during June and July in the Georgia site, when right whales were not expected to be in the area.

In Chesapeake Bay and North Carolina, blue crabs have suffered from unexplained population crashes in recent years, purportedly due to increase fishing pressure and habitat degradation. Despite the importance of this species and the propensity for their stocks to crash, a realistic and predictive population model is still lacking for blue crabs. This RAPID project will use a metapopulation approach to understand and predict the population dynamics of blue crabs. Blue crabs spend their initial, larval, life-stages in the ocean then recruit to estuaries for their juvenile and adult stages. In the metapopulation model to be used, local dynamics in a patch (estuary) will be described and parameterized using fisheries data, remotely-sensed habitat quality estimates, and results from field experiments estimating cannibalism rates. The PIs will estimate connectivity (dispersal of larvae between estuaries) of the population with a particle tracking approach using a fine-scale, spatially-explicit ocean circulation model. When the Deepwater Horizon oil rig exploded on April 20, 2010, and began discharging several million gallons of oil into the Gulf, blue crabs were just beginning their spawning season. In this RAPID, the PIs propose to investigate the impacts of the oil and chemical dispersants on the larval stages, and ultimately on population dynamics, of blue crabs by sampling planktonic larvae at three ocean locations that vary in distance from the oil source. Results will estimate both lethal and sub-lethal effects of oil and dispersants on larvae. They will incorporate the extent and concentration of oil and dispersants into the particle-tracking model and use it to predict the effects of the oil spill on dispersal and recruitment for the entire Gulf of Mexico. To validate model results, the PIs will sample recruitment to estuaries over a wide stretch of the coastline, including areas unaffected, lightly affected and heavily affected by the spill. They will incorporate results into the metapopulation model to explore the long-term effects of the spill on the Gulf of Mexico blue crab population and its fishery. Broader Impacts: The PIs intend that results from this RAPID project will be used to inform fisheries policy so as to prevent collapses of blue crab fishery in the Gulf, especially in light of the recent oil spill. Dispersal information is lacking from current blue crab fishery assessments and may prove especially important now in helping to decide how to not exacerbate the effects of the oil spill. Their sampling will also be useful to document and consider the effects of oil and of dispersants on other commercially and ecologically important species with planktonic larvae, such as menhaden and shrimp. This project will provide interdisciplinary research experiences for several undergraduate and graduate students including field projects as well as computational experience.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,1042792,,,,,,,,Tulane University,,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:13917280,,

Characterizing the acoustic properties of T-PODs enables the interpretation of data obtained with different devices. Here, the detection thresholds of different T-POD versions for harbor porpoise clicks were determined. While thresholds among devices were quite variable in the first T-POD generations, they became more standardized in newer versions. Furthermore, the influence of user-controlled settings on the threshold was investigated. From version 3 on, the detection threshold was found to be easily adjustable with version-dependent setting options minimum intensity and sensitivity, enabling the presetting of standard thresholds. In version 4, the setting click bandwidth had a strong influence on the detection threshold, while selectivity in version 3 and noise adaptation = ON or OFF in version 4 hardly influenced thresholds obtained in the tank tests. Nevertheless, the latter setting may influence thresholds in a complex acoustic environment like the sea.

Better understanding human-wildlife interactions and their links with management can help improve the design of wildlife protection zones. One important example is the problem of wildlife collisions with vehicles or human-built structures (e.g. power lines, wind farms). In fact, collisions between marine wildlife and watercraft are among the major threats faced by several endangered species of marine mammals. Natural resource managers are therefore interested in finding cost-effective solutions to mitigate these threats. 2. We combined abundance estimators with encounter rate theory to estimate relative lethal collision risk of the Florida manatee (Trichechus manatus latirostris) from watercraft. We first modeled seasonal abundance of watercraft and manatees using a Bayesian analysis of aerial survey count data. We then modeled relative lethal collision risk in space and across seasons. Finally, we applied decision analysis and Linear Integer Programming to determine the optimal design of speed zones in terms of relative risk to manatees and costs to waterway users. We used a Pareto efficient frontier approach to evaluate the performance of alternative zones, which included additional practical considerations (e.g. spatial aggregation of speed zones) in relation to the optimal zone configurations. 3. Under the various relationships for probability of death given strike speed that we considered, the current speed zones reduced the relative lethal collision risk by an average of 51.5% to 70% compared to the scenario in which all speed regulations were removed (i.e. the no-protection scenario). We identified optimal zones and near-optimal zones with additional management considerations that improved upon the current zones in terms of cost or relative risk. 4. Policy Implications: Our analytical framework combines encounter rate theory and decision analysis to quantify the effectiveness of speed zones protecting manatees while accounting for uncertainty. Our approach can be used to optimize the design of protection zones intended to reduce conflicts between human waterborne activity and marine mammals. This framework could be extended to address many other problems of human-wildlife interactions, such as the optimal placement of wind farms to minimize collisions with wildlife or the optimal allocation of ranger effort to mitigate poaching threats.

The influence of the way in which OM interacts with minerals on pore structure during the formation of oil-prone shales are scarcely understood. A good knowledge for complex organic-mineral interactions is critical for understanding the pore structure in immaturity oil-prone shales. Based on a detailed study of mineralogical, petrographic, and geochemical properties from lacustrine shales of the non-marine Songliao Basin (NE, China), we identified six types of OM occurrences, including bioclastic OM, mineral surface-bound OM, clay interlayer-sorbed OM, detritus pore-fill OM, mineral and clay surface-hosted OMs. They are grouped into bioclastic OM (22.7%), mineral associated OM (75.3%), and free OM (2.2%), representing positive correlations with whole-rock total organic carbon (TOC) contents, and in which the mineral associated OM dominates. Their influences on the pore structure by the interaction between OM and minerals are outlined in immaturity oil-prone shales. These processes include chemical adsorption of soluble OM in micropores, physical adsorption of particulate OM in mesopores, and mechanical stacking of bioclastic OM in macropores during sedimentation and diagenesis. The thermal maturity, diagenesis, dissolution, and compaction affect the growth of secondary pores and fissures, while the types of OM-minerals and their relative abundance influence the development of primary pores and their structure. Thus, we propose a significant role of OM occurrences in modifying the pore structure by the physical and chemical interaction between OM and minerals during the formation of oil-prone shales. These results are suggested to improve the understanding of OM occurrences in primary pores of immaturity shales and contribute to the interpretation of the efficient burial of organic carbon (OC).

In the present paper, we tested two strains of the ubiquitous Alcanivorax genus, namely A. jadensis KS_339 and A. dieselolei KS_293, which is known to rapidly grow after oil spills. Strains were subjected to atmospheric and mild pressure (0.1, 5 and 10 MPa, corresponding to a depth of 0, 500 and 1000 m, respectively) providing n-dodecane as sole carbon source.

The discovery of the first active mud volcano (Carmen; cruise TTR-17) in 2008, along with several pockmarks at the central part of the basin, motivates more careful geological and geochemical analysis of previous data and comparison to new observations.Gas bubbling from the crater of Carmen MV was observed and recorded using an underwater TV-system and a large TV-grab sample. The gas mainly consisted of methane with less than 1% wetness. However, all sets of homologues up to pentane were detected in the mud breccia of Carmen MV. Both molecular and stable carbon isotopic compositions, and their distribution along the core length, suggest a deep thermogenic source of hydrocarbons (HCs). Composition of the pore water from Carmen MV also points to a deep source of mud volcanic water. The isotopic results indicate that the source of mud volcanic water is the dehydration of clay minerals in the thermal zone of the smectite-to-illite transformation. Our observations allow us to infer the presence of structure II gas hydrates in mud breccia on the top of Carmen MV.High HC gas saturation in sediments in some pockmarks accompanied with live chemosynthetic fauna directly indicates the strong seepage activity of these structures.

Authigenic carbonates consist of aragonite and calcite, and are characterized by a light carbon isotopic signature, up to -37.2 parts per thousand PDB, which points to their methane-derived origin.

The first level (Tier #1) screening determines the potential energy resource to be exploited and then identifies areas that are prohibited from siting because there is a direct, irreconcilable conflict, as determined by a stakeholder process and vetted by regulators. Areas that remain after these exclusions are implemented are candidates for facility siting. The next step involves considering technical (engineering and economic) attributes of the proposed energy development that further restricts the area under consideration. Finally, Tier #2 screening (not addressed here) evaluates other use conflicts such as recreational and commercial fishing areas, marine mammal feeding and breeding grounds and transit paths, bird migratory paths, feeding, and nesting areas, and similar issues that must be considered in facility siting.To facilitate the application of technology constraints on siting, two methods are proposed, a Technology Development Index (TDI) and a Principal Components - Cluster Analysis (PCCA). The TDI method, developed by the authors and presented in this paper, is the ratio of the Technical Challenge Index (ICI) to the Power Production Potential (PPP) of the energy extraction device. TCI is a measure of how difficult it is to site the device at a given location plus a measure of the distance to the closest electrical grid connection point. The PPP is an estimate of the annual power production of one of the devices. The site with the lowest TDI represents the optimum location. In practice, the study area is gridded and the TDI (TCI and PPP) is calculated for each grid. The method explicitly accounts for the spatial variability of all input data. Simulations can be performed either deterministically or stochastically, using a Monte Carlo method, so that uncertainties in the underlying input data are reflected in the estimated values of the TDI. The later approach allows detailed assessment of the sensitivity of the estimates to the input data and formulations of the ICI and PPP. The results are presented in the form of contours of TDI. The method can be applied to any offshore renewable energy type or extraction system once the technical attributes are specified.The PCCA approach uses several spatially varying variables that describe the key attributes of the siting decision (e.g., water depth, power production potential, distance to shore, and seabed conditions). The principal components are first determined from the gridded data and then clusters are identified. Finally, the clusters are mapped to the study area. The attributes and spatial distribution of clusters provide insight into the optimum locations for development.The two methods were employed in identifying potential areas for siting of a wind farm in coastal waters of Rhode Island, assuming lattice jacket support structures for the wind turbines. Both methods give consistent results and show locations where the ratio of technical challenge to power production is minimized.",,,,,,,,,18,0,0,0,3,0,24,,,0025-3324,1948-1209,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Rhode Isl, Environm Data Ctr, Kingston, RI 02881 USA",,,,2010-01-01,WOS:000276062400003,,

The aim of this study was to make a systematic review of all studies which examine effects of shift and night work in the offshore petroleum industry, to synthesize the knowledge of how shift work offshore may affect the workers. Searches for studies concerning effects on health, sleep, adaptation, safety, working conditions, family- and social life and turnover were conducted via the databases Web of Knowledge, PsycINFO and PubMed. Search was also conducted through inspection of reference lists of relevant literature. We identified studies describing effects of shift work in terms of sleep, adaptation and re-adaptation of circadian rhythms, health outcomes, safety and accidents, family and social life, and work perceptions. Twenty-nine studies were included. In conclusion, the longitudinal studies were generally consistent in showing that adaptation to night work was complete within one to two weeks of work, while re-adaptation to a daytime schedule was slower. Shift workers reported more sleep problems than day workers. The data regarding mental and physical health, family and social life, and accidents yielded inconsistent results, and were insufficient as a base for drawing general conclusions.

Crack initiation fatigue tests in the regime of 10(6) to 10(10) cycles were carried out on smooth specimens under three different environment conditions: (i) without any corrosion (virgin state) in air, (ii) in air after pre-corrosion, and (iii) in-situ corrosion-fatigue under artificial sea water flow. A drastic effect of sea water corrosion was found: the median fatigue strength beyond 10(8) cycles is divided by 5 compared to virgin state specimens. The crack initiation sites were corrosion pits caused by pre-corrosion or created during corrosion-fatigue under sea water flow. Furthermore some sub-surface and internal crack initiations were observed on specimens without any corrosion (virgin state). Crack propagation curves were obtained in mode I in air and under sea water flow. Calculation of the stress intensity factor at the tip of cracks emanating from hemispherical surface pits combined with the Paris-Hertzberg-Mc Clintock crack growth rate model showed that fatigue crack initiation period represents most of the fatigue life in the VHCF regime. Additional original experiments have shown physical evidences that the fatigue strength in the gigacycle regime under sea water flow is mainly governed by the corrosion process with a strong coupling between cyclic loading and corrosion.

Need for energy has led the people to move into the ocean since they contain abundant natural resources. Offshore platforms play a major role in exploring and exploiting these resources. Jacket platform being a fixed offshore jacket platform is used in water depths 300 to 400 m. The study of behavior of these offshore structures is vital part in the design since they are subjected to dynamic loading of waves, wind, earthquake, ice etc. These structures in hostile environment are subjected to heavy loads. There is need for controlling the response of these structures. This can be achieved by providing external dampers.There are various dampers available to control the response of structures. Tuned liquid dampers (TLD)s and Tuned Liquid Column Damper (TLCD)s use liquid inside to tune its frequency to natural frequency of structure. Tuned Liquid Column Gas Damper (TLCGD) is latest version of dampers. It has a unique flexibility of tuning frequency compared to all other dampers.In the present study, jacket platform is modeled as Multi degree of freedom (MDOF) system. At later stage, for simplistic analysis, MDOF system is reduced to SDOF system using static condensation. Performance of TLCGD for both the systems is compared. Airy's wave theory is used for wave force excitation. Equations of motions for Jacket platform models attached with TLCGD are developed and solved using Newmarks 13 method in MATLAB. TLCGD is found to be very flexible in tuning the frequency and maximum reductions in response, 21.3% and 23.14% are observed at 0.3 MPa for MDOF and SDOF systems respectively. Work done shows that the results for MDOF and SDOF are comparable and hence, jacket as SDOF can be used for analysis for reducing the complexities.",,,,,"36th ASME International Conference on Ocean, Offshore and Arctic Engineering36th ASME International Conference on Ocean, Offshore and Arctic Engineering","JUN 25-30, 2017JUN 25-30, 2017","ASME, Ocean Offshore & Arctic Engn DivASME, Ocean Offshore & Arctic Engn Div","Trondheim, NORWAYTrondheim, NORWAY",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,978-0-7918-5763-2,,,,,,,,,"Vignans Fdn Sci Technol & Res Univ, Dept Civil Engn, Guntur 522213, AP, IndiaNIT Calicut, Dept Civil Engn, Calicut 673601, Kerala, India",,,,2017-12-27,WOS:000417224400067,,

The translated gliding robotic fish technology has the following unique features: low cost, compact size, high maneuverability, long operational duration, and adaptability to versatile applications. It provides exemplary advantages in performance, cost-effectiveness, and portability when compared to the leading competing technologies in this market place, including propeller-driven autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) and ocean gliders. The project accomplishes its goals by (1) developing a modularized payload architecture to facilitate convenient customization and cost-effective maintenance of the product, (2) developing a solar and wave-energy harvesting system to enable continuous, long-duration field operation, and (3) demonstrating a prototype of a gliding robotic fish incorporating these advances. The partnership engages the environmental monitoring industry and potential users of the technology to provide guidance in prototype development and market analysis as they pertain to the potential to translate the gliding robotic fish technology along a path that may result in a competitive commercial reality. The potential economic impact is expected to be over $200M for the next 15 years, which will contribute to the U.S. competitiveness in the autonomous underwater sensing market.

Additionally, we respond to live and dead strandings of cetacean and pinniped species for which there are no density or tagging data in the area, but where we have regular documentation of occurrence in the stranding record. Compiling these data into a single spatial analysis allows us to better: 1) understand human and wildlife use of areas, 2) plan for development, and 3) predict potential conflicts. Our tagging and sighting projects can be used to understand species habitat use. For the tagging data, we included a maximum of one location data point per day from five satellite-tagged loggerhead sea turtles (Caretta caretta) from July-October in 2011. From this analysis, we calculated that 71% (64 out of 118) of the data points were within 30 nm of one or more mid-Atlantic Wind Energy Areas (MAWEAs). During 2011, a total of 14,576 km of aerial survey transits resulted in 1,572 sea turtle sightings, with 1,122 animals (71%) located within 30 nm of the Virginia WEA. In addition, 49% (227 out of 648) of bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus) group sightings, representing 57% (1471 out of 2588) individual animals, were within 30nm of MAWEAs. Using photo identification techniques, we documented a minimum of 57 humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae) and 5 fin whales (Balaenoptera physalus) in near-shore Virginia ocean waters from December 2011 through February 2012. One major challenge to applying this biological monitoring data in marine spatial planning efforts is the lack of spatial density data for marine mammals and sea turtles, particularly on a regional and seasonal scale. In the U. S. mid-Atlantic region, relatively few survey efforts have occurred, and those that were conducted have been of such broad scale that few, if any, of the less common species were sighted. These results have led to calculated densities of zero or near zero for some species in a region where anecdotally we know that they regularly occur. When these densities are applied to management documents, inaccurate conclusions may be made regarding environmental impact assessments. For example, the 2012 Draft Programmatic Environmental Impact Statement (DPEIS) for the Atlantic OCS Proposed Geological and Geophysical Activities Mid-Atlantic and South Atlantic Planning Areas used marine mammal density calculations to model marine mammal takes from seismic surveys and assign an environmental impact measure to the action. Densities were reported for all marine mammal species with habitat ranges in the area. The DPEIS identifies Zone 20 extending across the continental shelf from Cape Lookout to the Delaware Bay, including Virginia waters. Many of the species have zero or near zero reported densities, but have regular presence in Virginia stranding and sighting records (Table 1). Humpback whales and bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) are of particular interest, because both our sighting reports and our stranding data are inconsistent with these densities. A similar problem has occurred in analyses of vertical line and whale co-occurrence that was conducted for the NOAA Fisheries Atlantic Large Whale Take Reduction Team. Lack of formal survey data from the mid-Atlantic region resulted in a model with large areas of zero density, despite extensive anecdotal stranding and sighting records.We propose that a method for determining minimum density should be developed and utilized for species with verified anecdotal records, such as stranding data. Then we can better model animal presence, and potential impacts from human activities, for species with inadequate data from formal surveys. The monitoring of anthropogenic activity in marine habitats is also important to predict the cumulative impact of development to populations and species. During our 2008-2009 ship characterization study, we utilized AIS technology to record 323 vessels (18,473km of transits) traveling through the Virginia WEA, representing 30% of all AIS recorded large vessel traffic. Ship traffic rerouting as a result of wind energy development could increase the risk of interactions between wildlife and human activity by potentially displacing whales and ships into smaller, higher-density areas. Commercial fishing and Federal vessel activity are currently unrepresented in AIS datasets, and should be monitored and considered in spatial planning efforts in order to have a complete picture of how offshore development projects will affect all vessel activity. Marine spatial planning is an important tool to mitigate potential conflicts associated with ocean use issues, and both biological monitoring data and human use information are essential for the process to be successful. This analysis indicates that non-traditional sources of data, in addition to data from traditional density surveys, are being used to monitor endangered and protected species and should be included in the spatial planning process to inform management decisions.",,,,,MTS/IEEE Oceans ConferenceMTS/IEEE Oceans Conference,"OCT 14-19, 2012OCT 14-19, 2012",IEEE; Marine Technol Soc; IEEE Ocean Engn SocIEEE; Marine Technol Soc; IEEE Ocean Engn Soc,"Virginia Beach, VAVirginia Beach, VA",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,978-1-4673-0829-8; 978-1-4673-0830-4,,,,,,,,,"Virginia Aquarium & Marine Sci Ctr Fdn, Res & Conservat Sect, Virginia Beach, VA 23451 USARiverhead Fdn Marine Res & Preservat, New York, NY USA",Virginia Aquarium & Marine Sci Ctr FdnRiverhead Fdn Marine Res & Preservat,,,2013-05-05,WOS:000315350300176,,

The bacterial community composition was assessed using PCR amplification, cloning, sequencing, and phylogenetic analysis of 16S rDNA using directly extracted sediment DNA. Most of the clones sequenced fell into six major lineages of the domain Bacteria: gamma-, delta-, epsilon-Proteobocteria, Acidobacteria/Holophago. Bacteroidetes, and Planctomycetes. Although there were no significant differences in the bacterial community Structures among the sediment samples except for Sagami Bay, a minor change in the composition of 16S rDNA operational taxonomy units (OTUs) between sites was recognized. 16S rDNA sequences related to the gamma-Proteobacteria were recovered with relatively higher frequencies from unpolluted sediments than from Polluted sediments. In contrast, the most abundant clone sequences from polluted sediment samples were grouped with delta-Proteobacteria. Our data suggests organic enrichment of sediment may influence the composition of bacterial communities; and the delta-Proteobacteria were found and selected for within polluted fish farm sediments.

Maritime spatial planning is a complex task with similarities to but also significant differences from onshore spatial planning. The sea is a multidimensional environmental, economic and social territory, so the methods and methodologies used for classical land-use planning can vary. The management of the coastal zone, which is the link between the land and the sea, is critical. The adoption of European Union Directive 2014/89 has led to the creation of a new national legal framework for the preparation of maritime spatial plans in European Union member states, including Greece. However, the complexity of the interactions between anthropogenic pressures and the marine ecosystem makes it essential to quantitatively assess the impact of the land uses included in proposed local spatial plans. Thus, the cumulative impact score index (Ic) was used to assess the pressures on the coastal environment caused by the land uses proposed in the local spatial plan for the Mastichochoria area of the island of Chios in Greece. Based on the results of the case study, the authors argue that quantitative analytical tools are required for comprehensive and effective planning, especially within the ecosystem approach framework. The results indicate that an integrated approach between onshore and offshore institutional spatial planning is required, and that a new, more effective spatial governance model is needed in Greece.",,,,,,,,,10,0,0,0,1,0,10,,,2365-6433,2365-7448,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Thessaly, Dept Planning & Reg Dev, Ped Areos 1, Volos 38334, GreeceUniv West Attica, Dept Surveying & Geoinformat Engn, Athens, Greece",,,,2020-05-15,WOS:000530500800003,,

This paper presents a new framework for design strategy based on performance measures for cyclic horizontally loaded monopile foundations located in saturated and dry dense sand, by considering pile deformations and pore pressure accumulation effects. A three-dimensional finite element model was developed to investigate the behavior of large-diameter piles. The model accounts for nonlinear dynamic interactions in offshore platforms under harsh combined moment and horizontal environmental loads, with emphasis on the cyclic mobility of the surrounding cohesionless subsoil and associated shear. The maximum moment applied in the cyclic analyses is varied from 18% to 47% of the ultimate resistance. The considered data reflect behavior at the expected load amplitudes and cycle numbers during the service life of operation. For low numbers of load cycles (< 1000 cycles), there were no differences between the power law and logarithmic approaches in terms of describing the accumulated deformations; however, for high numbers of cycles (< 10,000 cycles), the logarithmic law was less suited to describe the accumulation response. Magnitude of cyclic loads was found to cause a linear increase in the accumulated rotation. The results from short-term and long-term dynamic response of monopiles indicate that few load cycles with higher load levels are the main concerns in accumulation of pile rotation rather than thousands of load cycles with low amplitudes.",,,,,,,,,37,1,0,0,0,0,38,,,0267-7261,1879-341X,,,,,,,,,,"Aalborg Univ, Dept Civil Engn, Thomas Manns Vej 23, DK-9220 Aalborg O, Aalborg, DenmarkVirginia Tech, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USABabol Univ Technol, Dept Civil Engn, Babol Sar, IranNewcastle Univ, Sch Civil Engn & Geosci, Newcastle Upon Tyne NE1 7RU, Tyne & Wear, England",,,,2017-07-18,WOS:000404707600034,,

We describe modelling techniques for predicting golden eagle ranging behaviour within a Geographic Information System (GIS). The model, called PAT (Predicting Aquila Territory), used data on ranging behaviour and geospatial factors from two areas of western Scotland. A range centre was estimated from the weighted mean nest site location in the past ten years. Range boundaries were estimated from Thiessen polygons, in the presence of neighbouring ranges, and a maximum ranging distance generated from parameters responsive to local range density, in the absence of neighbouring ranges. The model assumed that eagles did not use the sea or freshwater bodies, and avoided areas of human activity and closed canopy forests. The model also assumed that golden eagles preferred areas close to ridges (and other convex terrain features) and close to the centre of the range. The model output, at 50 x 50 m resolution, was three-dimensional with geographical location as x and y co-ordinates and use as a percentage of total home range use as the z co-ordinate. Comparison of the model's predictions against range use observations suggested that it provided a good fit to observed range use.

Reduction of iron oxides is one of the more energetically favorable forms of anaerobic respiration, with a higher energy yield than both sulfate reduction and methanogenesis. As such, this process has significant implications for soil carbon balances, especially in the saturated, carbon-rich soils of the northern latitudes. However, the dynamics of these microbial processes within the context of the greater soil microbiome remain largely unstudied. Previously, we have demonstrated the capability of potentiostatically poised electrodes to mimic the redox potential of iron(III)- and humic acid-compounds and obtain a measure of metal-reducing respiration. Here, we extend this work by utilizing poised electrodes to provide an inexaustable electron acceptor for iron- and humic acid-reducing microbes, and by measuring the effects on both microbial community structure and greenhouse gas emissions. The application of both nonpoised and poised graphite electrodes in peat soils stimulated methane emissions by 15%-43% compared to soils without electrodes. Poised electrodes resulted in higher (13%-24%) methane emissions than the nonpoised electrodes. The stimulation of methane emissions for both nonpoised and poised electrodes correlated with the enrichment of proteobacteria, verrucomicrobia, and bacteroidetes. Here, we demonstrate a tool for precisely manipulating localized redox conditions in situ (via poised electrodes) and for connecting microbial community dynamics with larger ecosystem processes.

Data were gathered during a 1-day study on 3 March 2003 with the use of 15 vertical sand traps, 13 erosion pins, and eight sets of anemometers placed 0.3, 0.6, and 0.9 in above the ground surface.

The highest rate of trapping was 2.4 kg m(-1) h(-1) at a < 10-m-wide unvegetated area in the dune.Houses shelter the dune from offshore winds and might contribute to dune stability. Increases in wind speed in the offshore direction cause greater rates of transport on the seaward side of the dune where vegetation has not had time to become established. Dune vegetation, remnant sand fences, wrack lines, and the sheltered area in the lee of the seaward dune ridge can trap sediment moving offshore during relatively low wind speeds. Sediment deposited at these obstacles could contribute to deflation of the backshore, which is the primary source of sediment moved to the intertidal foreshore.

Fish were housed in isolation, paired with another fish or exposed to only the electrocommunication signals of another fish for 7 days. After 3 days of exposure to these stimulus conditions, fish were injected with bromodeoxyuridine (Brdu) to mark newborn cells. We sacrificed the fish 4 days after BrdU injection and used immunohistochemistry to measure cell addition (BrdU+), the fraction of added cells that differentiated into neurons (BrdU+/NeuroTrace +) and the density of radial glia fibers (vimentio+) in the periventricular zone of the diencephalon. Fish that were exposed only to the electrocommunication signals of another fish and no other social stimuli had equivalent levels of cell addition and radial glial fiber density to fish that were housed with full social interaction and higher levels than fish housed ill isolation. About 60% of the added cells differentiated into neurons; this fraction did not differ among treatment groups. Artificial sine wave electrical stimuli that mimicked elect rocommunication signals were ineffective in increasing cell addition and glia fiber formation above those found in isolated fish. Thus, stimuli through a single modality are sufficient for inducing this brain plasticity, but the waveform or dynamic features of communication signals are crucial for the effect.

In this paper, specific attention is paid to renewable energy technologies (RETs) for electricity and heat generation and reviews current understanding and estimates of life cycle GHG emissions from a range of renewable electricity and heat generation technologies. Comprehensive literature reviews for each RET were carried out. The 79 studies reviewed involved the life cycle assessment (LCA) of renewable electricity and heat generation based on onshore and offshore winds, hydropower, marine technologies (wave power and tidal energy), geothermal, photovoltaic (PV), solar thermal, biomass, waste, and heat pumps. The study demonstrates the variability of existing LCA studies (results) in tracking GHG emissions for electricity and heat generation from RETs. This review has shown that the lowest GHG emissions were associated with offshore wind technologies (mean life cycle GHG emissions could be 5.3-13 g CO2 eq/kWh). Results compared with GHG estimates by fossil fuel heat and electricity indicated that life cycle GHG emissions are comparatively higher in conventional sources as compared to renewable sources with the exception of nuclear-based power electricity generation. In this present study, considering renewable energy sources, waste treatment and dedicated biomass technologies (DBTs) were found to potentially have high GHG emissions based on the feedstock, selected boundary and the inputs required for their production. The study identifies additional impacts associated with renewable electricity and heat technologies, points out the effectiveness of life cycle analysis (LCA) as a tool for assessing environmental impacts of renewable energy sources and concludes with opportunities for improvement in the future.

Airflows are altered and modulated by motion over and around natural and human-engineered structures, and both vortical flow structures and turbulence are introduced to the aerial environment by technologies such as aircraft and wind farms. Diverse aspects of the biology of flight may be better understood with reference to an aeroecological approach, particularly the mechanics and energetics of flight, the sensing of aerial flows, and the motor control of flight. Moreover, not only does the abiotic world influence the aerospheric conditions in which animals fly, but flying animals also, in turn, change the flow environment in their immediate vicinity, which can include the air through which other animals fly, particularly when animals fly in groups.

This is particularly the case when testing for the effects of barotrauma, where the incision for an internal tag would inadvertently vent the fish, precluding an unvented or control treatment. The rise of barotrauma experimentation has increased the need for methods facilitating this design. Here, we develop and test a novel technique to externally attach acoustic tags, without causing the release of gasses from the fish's body cavity. In addition, this method does not require anesthetics, thereby allowing researchers to eliminate artifacts associated with sedation when trying to more accurately replicate real-world fishery conditions. We used accelerometer/depth tags to provide information on how long an externally tagged fish would retain its tag in situ. Changes in acceleration or changes in depth were used as a proxy to determine whether the fish was alive or dead or had shed its tag. Results showed that 80% of the fish (n = 20) detected retained their tags for at least 48 h. Seventy-five percent of the fish tagged retained their tags for at least 23 d. After 23 d, tags were shed periodically until day 49. Thirty-three percent of fish tagged retained their tags until day 57, when the experiment was ended. The ability of these modified tags to stay attached for at least 23 d suggests that the technique would be successful for maintaining a balanced experimental design for measuring postrelease mortality or changes in behavior in deepwater fishes while eliminating artifacts typically associated with internal tag implantation.",,,,,,,,,11,0,0,0,10,0,13,,,0002-8487,1548-8659,,,,,,,,,,"Texas A&M Univ Corpus Christi, Harte Res Inst Gulf Mexico Studies, Corpus Christi, TX 78412 USATexas Tech Univ, Dept Biol, Lubbock, TX 79409 USAUniv Western Sydney, Sch Sci & Hlth, Penrith, NSW 2751, Australia",,,,2015-08-26,WOS:000358854700017,,

Using micro-Raman spectroscopy, it is possible to characterise features of ice at a spatial resolution of a few to tens of micrometers, the scale of relevance to trapped microorganisms, by providing information concerning the presence and amount of molecular species present in the trapped liquids. We have applied this technique to determine the spatial distribution of sulphate, phosphate and carbonate anions in sea-ice veins using ice obtained from the vicinity of the Palmer Station, Antarctica. The observed sulphate concentrations were approximately 20-30% higher than nominal surface seawater concentrations, consistent with the concentration of brine in vein and inclusion liquids during the ice formation process. This concentration was lower than that in veins present in laboratory-prepared ice. Carbonate and dibasic phosphate anions were also observed in the sea ice. This speciation is consistent with an alkaline environment in the sea-ice aqueous system. The mean dibasic phosphate concentration found throughout the sample was 648 mM, while, for carbonate, it was 485 mM. However, these anions showed extremely high spatial variability. The high phosphate and carbonate enhancements observed relative to sulphate point to the influence of processes other than brine formation controlling the chemistry of these anions in sea ice.",,,,,,,,,3,0,0,0,1,0,3,,,0032-2474,1475-3057,,,,,,,,,,"Univ S Alabama, Dept Chem, Mobile, AL 36688 USA",,,,2015-05-13,WOS:000353023200008,,

This upwelling domain extends along the coasts of Washington, Oregon, and California. Many living marine resources develop in this region, which includes five National Marine Sanctuaries. Variability in ocean climate in this region directly and indirectly influences both harvested and protected marine populations, including numerous species of marine fishes, invertebrates, marine mammals, and seabirds. The California Current System is also important to drawdown of atmospheric carbon dioxide and carbon sequestration, due to the high primary productivity of the coastal ocean and processes that transfer carbon and other elements into deep ocean waters. Of sources of climate variability, El Niño is considered the largest climate signal on earth. It markedly influences many ocean populations, as well as modifying weather patterns across the United States. The current El Niño of 2015-16 has been characterized as a strong event by the U.S. Climate Prediction Center, and may become one of the strongest El Niños in recent history. In addition, this El Niño follows a sustained, unusual warming in the Northeast Pacific Ocean that began in 2014, and then intensified along the west coast of North America in 2015. The combination of these two ocean perturbations is expected to alter marine ecosystems in many ways. The purpose of the proposed research is to quantify the effects of El Niño on key processes acting on planktonic organisms at the base of the ocean food web, because responses of these organisms are fundamental to understanding and forecasting the effects of El Niño on higher order consumers in the food web. The Broader Impacts of this research include the provision of new quantitative understanding that will be incorporated into future forecast models of the effects of El Niño off the U.S. west coast. This improved understanding will aid in the management of key living marine resources. The research will involve numerous graduate students in at-sea science and aid in the training of the next generation of ocean scientists. The investigators will develop public programs and outreach efforts in collaboration with the Birch Aquarium at Scripps, including an Explore-It: Plankton! public program that will increase public awareness and understanding of El Niño effects on coastal pelagic communities. They will also develop a Science Exploration Adventure (SEA) Days program that will focus on the CCE El Niño response cruise, in order to connect visitors directly to the process of ocean research and careers in the ocean sciences. A RAPID response proposal is necessary because this El Niño will be of limited duration and there is insufficient time to submit a proposal through the regular process. A 20-day research cruise will be conducted in the southern sector of the California Current Ecosystem, a region with an extensive series of baseline measurements against which the effects of El Niño can be compared. We will quantify the effects of El Niño on key rate processes that control the structure of the pelagic food web and control rates of elemental cycling. The processes measured will include primary and secondary production, grazing, dissolved iron effects on phytoplankton growth, carbon and nitrogen recycling, and elemental export in both particulate and dissolved forms. The measurement approach entails a Lagrangian (water parcel-tracking) study of a series of discrete water parcels that represent different subregions: the nearshore coastal upwelling region, the offshore wind-stress curl upwelling domain, the low salinity core flow of the California Current proper, and more stratified ocean conditions offshore. Measurements will be done by in situ incubations at multiple light depths, by simulated in situ incubations aboard ship, and by vertically stratified sampling in each discrete water parcel. These measurements will facilitate the development of quantitative forecast models that can be used to project ocean responses to future El Niños and perhaps other warming phenomena.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,1614359,,,,,,,,University of California-San Diego Scripps Inst of Oceanography,,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:13920028,,

Two new analogues of seawater-responsive silanes, (N-methoxyacylethyl)-3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane (MAPS) and bis(N-methoxyacylethyl)-3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane (BMAPS) were synthesized by aza-Michael addition with cost-efficient agents, and grafted onto SiO2 nanoparticles by silanization to achieve modified-SiO2 (M-SiO2 and BM-SiO2). The modified-SiO2 was embedded into PDMS to construct biomimetic heteroarchitecture coatings that could transform from superhydrophobicity in air to underwater superoleophobicity. The coatings could self-regenerate underwater superoleophobicity after mechanical abrasion. The hierarchical structure and oil tolerance can be maintained after field-exposure trials or five months of immersion in artificial seawater. The synergy of the hydrated barrier layers and the intrinsic nature of the zwitterions that gave rise to the AF capability of the PDMS/modified-SiO2 coatings was demonstrated by laboratory assays and marine field trials.

Global-scale environmental degradation and its links with non-renewable fossil fuels have led to an increasing interest in generating electricity from renewable energy resources. Much of this interest centres on offshore renewable energy developments (ORED). The large scale of proposed ORED will add to the existing human pressures on coastal ecosystems, therefore any ecological costs and benefits must be determined.2. The current pressures on coastal ecology set the context within which the potential impacts (both positive and negative) of offshore renewable energy generation are discussed.3. The number of published peer-review articles relating to renewable energy has increased dramatically since 1991. Significantly, only a small proportion of these articles relate to environmental impacts and none considers coastal ecology.4. Actual or potential environmental impact can occur during construction, operation and/or decommissioning of ORED.5. Construction and decommissioning are likely to cause significant physical disturbance to the local environment. There are both short- and long-term implications for the local biological communities. The significance of any effects is likely to depend on the natural disturbance regime and the stability and resilience of the communities.6. During day-to-day operation, underwater noise, emission of electromagnetic fields and collision or avoidance with the energy structures represent further potential impacts on coastal species, particularly large predators. The wider ecological implications of any direct and indirect effects are discussed.7. Synthesis and applications. This review demonstrates that ORED will have direct and, potentially, indirect consequences for coastal ecology, with these effects occurring at different scales. Ecologists should be involved throughout all the phases of an ORED to ensure that appropriate assessments of the interaction of single and multiple developments with the coastal environment are undertaken.",,,,,,,,,270,2,0,0,139,0,295,,,0021-8901,1365-2664,,,,,,,,,,"Cranfield Univ, Inst Water & Environm, Silsoe MK45 4DT, Beds, England",,,,2005-08-01,WOS:000230602100001,,

Both selected oils are examples of those currently used for commercial purposes. Casablanca crude oil is aliphatic with a low viscosity; Maya represents a sulphur-rich heavy crude oil that is predominantly aromatic. In the unpolluted microcosms, Microcoleus chthonoplastes-, Phormidium- and Oscillatoria-like were the dominant filamentous cyanobacterial morphotypes, whilst Synechoccocus-, Synechocystis- and Gloeocapsa-like were the most abundant unicellular cyanobacteria. After oil contamination, no significant changes of chlorophyll a and protein concentrations were observed, though cyanobacterial diversity shifts were monitored. Among filamentous cyanobacteria, M. chthonoplastes-like morphotype was the most resistant for both oils, unlike the other cyanobacteria, which tolerated Casablanca but not Maya. Unicellular cyanobacteria seemed to be resistant to pollution with both essayed oils, with the exception of the morphotype resembling Gloeocapsa, which was sensitive to both oils. The crude-oil addition also had a significant effect on certain components of the heterotrophic microbial community. Casablanca oil induced an increase in anaerobic heterotrophic bacteria, whereas the opposite effect was observed in those heterotrophs when polluted with Maya oil. The overall results, microbiological and crude-oil transformation analysis, indicate that the indigenous community has a considerable potential to degrade oil components by means of the metabolic cooperation of phototrophic and heterotrophic populations.

With increasing concern over the potential effects of ocean energy utilization on marine environment and organisms, several previous experimental studies have been conducted focusing on fish behavior and their collision risk with hydrokinetic turbines for power generation. This study is aimed at exploring the behavior of marine animals around marine current turbines (MCTs) in the sea environment by conducting a laboratory experiment based on similarity laws for the turbine tip speed and maximum marine animal swimming speed. Three rotation frequencies (0, 5 and 20 rpm) with two releasing areas (upstream and downstream areas) were considered in our experiment. Results showed that fish survival rate was 100 % after 48 h, and only one fish came into contact with the turbine hub and was inactive in front of it when the MCT was in a stationary state during our preliminary test of swimming endurance. Although both the initial releasing area of fish and the rotation speed of MCT have significant effects on fish passage count rate (PCR) via a turbine, there is no interaction between these two factors. PCR was generally higher when fish were put into the tank in the downstream area, irrespective of the turbine rotation. And the returning behavior in the downstream area was more frequently found compared with that in the upstream area, which indicates that the location of MCTs should be considered at the downstream of a channel in practice to reduce the potential risk of fish injury. The ratio of fish passing from the outer side (+/- 3) of the turbine was larger, and a clear U-shaped distribution could be observed. The entering behavior almost disappeared (less than 1.3 %) when MCT rotated with a frequency of 20 rpm. It indicates the design of the rotation frequency of MCT should be more than 20 rpm. However, higher tip speeds and darkness conditions are not considered in our experiment. Based on the laws of similarity proposed in this study, it becomes possible to compare the experimental results with real sea results, to allow explanation and discussion of fish behavior around MCTs, through the parameters of flow velocity, turbine tip speed, and maximum fish swimming speed.",,,,,,,,,14,0,0,0,4,0,15,,,0948-4280,1437-8213,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Tokyo, Inst Ind Sci, Meguro Ku, 4-6-1 Komaba, Tokyo 1538505, JapanUniv Tokyo, Grad Sch Engn, Meguro Ku, 4-6-1 Komaba, Tokyo 1538505, Japan",,,,2017-06-06,WOS:000401788400002,,

These include deep-diving robotic submarines, gliders and surface vehicles that can take sensors to measure large areas in remote parts of the ocean. As the capability of marine and aerial autonomous systems increases more potential applications are becoming apparent, including the possibility to improve monitoring of industrial activities at sea. There is particular interest in how autonomous systems can be used to improve the quality and efficiency of routine monitoring of the environment and infrastructure relating to the oil and gas industry. There are also questions about how these systems can be used to monitor, and help in the response to oil spills. This project aims to investigate how autonomous surveillance systems (aerial and marine) can fit into emergency oil spill response and routine monitoring of the environment and infrastructure in the oil and gas industry.A researcher from the National Oceanography Centre (NOC) will work as an intern at Oil Spill Response Limited, an industry funded cooperative that responds to oil spills globally. The intern will carry out a wide ranging review of the scope of autonomous systems used commercially and in research to identify systems and sensors that may be applied in response to oil spills or routine monitoring. The work will then consider the design of surveys using multiple platforms such as autonomous marine and aerial vehicles to identify the requirements from deployment to data management. This will draw on lessons learned from NOC's experience with MAS. The conclusions from these studies will be used to investigate how autonomous systems could be incorporated into routine operations in an industrial setting which will them be presented to and discussed with members of the oil and gas industry and research community.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,NE/P013228/1,,,,,,,,National Oceanography Centre,National Oceanography Centre,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:15351989,,

The ecosystem services framework embraces this vision of nature through monetary valuation of the environment to correct market failures and government distortions that hinder efficient allocation of public goods, including goods and services provided by biodiversity and ecosystems. The popularity of this approach is reflected in different countries legislation; for instance, US, EU and UK have introduced economic criteria for comparing costs and benefits of environmental policies in protecting ecosystem services.From an operational perspective, the ecosystem services framework requires ecologists to estimate how the supply of services is affected by changes in the functionality and/or the extent of ecosystems; and economists to identify how changes in the supply affect the flow of direct and indirect benefits to people. However, this approach may be simplistic when faced with the complexity of social-ecological systems. We investigated this for three different marine services: assimilative capacity of waste, coastal defense and renewable energy. We find that economic valuation could provide efficient and fair allocations in the case of assimilative capacity, but leads to social clashes between outputs generated by cost benefit analysis and citizens' expectation in the case of coastal defense. In the case of renewable energy, controversies can be generated by regulatory mechanisms that are not necessarily aligned with the interests of industry or important social groups. We conclude that there is a need to integrate perspectives arising from utilitarian allocation of resources with those involving legislation and communal values in order to reconcile conflicting interests and better sustain marine social-ecological systems.

Understanding how these changes potentially cascade across marine and freshwater ecosystems requires knowing how mobile euryhaline species link these seemingly-disparate systems. As upper trophic level predators, bull sharks (Carcharhinus leucas) play a crucial role in marine and freshwater ecosystem health. Telemetry studies in Mobile Bay, Alabama suggest that bull sharks extensively use the northern portions of the bay, an estuarine-freshwater interface known as the Mobile-Tensaw Delta. To assess whether bull sharks use freshwater habitats in this region, environmental DNA surveys were conducted during the dry summer and wet winter seasons in 2018. In each season, 5 x1 L water samples were collected at each of 21 sites: five sites in Mobile Bay, six sites in the Mobile-Tensaw Delta, and ten sites throughout the Mobile-Tombigbee and Tensaw-Alabama Rivers. Water samples were vacuum-filtered, DNA extractions were performed on the particulate, and DNA extracts were analyzed with Droplet Digital Polymerase Chain Reaction using species-specific primers and an internal probe to amplify a 237-base pair fragment of the mitochondrial NADH dehydrogenase subunit 2 gene in bull sharks. One water sample collected during the summer in the Alabama River met the criteria for a positive detection, thereby confirming the presence of bull shark DNA. While preliminary, this finding suggests that bull sharks use less urbanized, riverine habitats up to 120 km upriver during Alabamas dry summer season. Water samples were collected at a series of estuarine, deltaic, and freshwater sites in Alabama once in the wet winter season (February 19-20, 2018) and once in the dry summer season (August 21-22, 2018). In total, five estuarine sites were sampled from Dauphin Island to the northern extent of Mobile Bay, six sites were sampled within the MTD, and ten freshwater sites were sampled in two river systems: the Mobile-Tombigbee and the Tensaw-Alabama. In each river system, sites spanned ~190 km north of the mouth to just south of the Coffeeville Lock and Dam and Claiborne Lock and Dam in the Tombigbee and Alabama Rivers, respectively (Fig. 1A). All sampling sites were spaced 15-25 km apart (Fig. 1A). At each site, 5  1 L water samples and environmental data, including temperature (C°), salinity (psu), dissolved oxygen (mg/L), and depth (m), were collected approximately 0.5 m below the surface of the water. While bull sharks are known to use the entire water column, previous studies have identified surface water sampling as the most suitable method for eDNA collection in headwaters (Katano et al. 2017). In Mobile Bay, water samples were collected in proximity to structures (e.g., oil rig, lighthouse), and at all riverine sites, samples were collected across the width of the river. All eDNA field and laboratory protocols and controls followed Schweiss et al. (2020), and new gloves were used at each sampling site. Water samples were collected in the field using sterile, 1 L high-density polyethylene Nalgene bottles and stored on ice in clean marine coolers, or frozen, until water filtration (see Schweiss et al., 2020). In addition to the filtration, DNA extraction, and PCR negative controls described in Schweiss et al. (2020), negative collection controls were also included. The negative collection controls consisted of autoclaved deionized water, which was taken onto the boat and placed in a clean marine cooler on ice with field samples to test for field contamination (e.g., Jerde et al., 2011). All negative control samples (collection, filtration, DNA extraction, and PCR) were processed and analyzed in replicates of five, according to the protocols of Schweiss et al. (2020), and were defined as negative if they did not meet any of the criteria for positive detections. Water samples were vacuum-filtered in a laboratory using 47-mm-diameter, 0.8-mum nylon filters (Cole Parmer, Illinois, USA) and preserved in 95% ethanol at room temperature (see Schweiss et al., 2020). Total eDNA was extracted from of each filter following the Goldberg et al. (2016) QIAGEN DNeasy Blood & Tissue Kit protocol incorporating the QIAshredder spin columns. A species-specific bull shark Droplet Digital PCR (ddPCR) assay was used to target a 237-base pair fragment of the mitochondrial NADH dehydrogenase subunit 2 (mtDNA ND2) gene using the reaction mixtures and ddPCR cycling conditions described in Schweiss et al. (2020). Five replicates (5% of the total eDNA extract) were run for each sample on the Bio-Rad QX200 AutoDG Droplet Digital PCR System (Droplet Generator instrument no. 773BR1456, Droplet Reader instrument no. 771BR2544) platform.

Cartridge filtration systems, particularly those involving spool wound elements are common in many areas of solid liquid separation. These include the chemical and pharmaceutical industries, domestic and industrial water processing, automotive and electroplating industries and also on offshore oil production platforms. However, the performance of these cartridges in actual service has been found to be less than ideal. The effect of organically loaded feedstreams on the performance of spool wound cartridge filters was determined using standard filter test methodology according to ISO 4572 (1981). The system was adapted allowing filter testing with aqueous fluids and dosing of the test fluid with concentrations of proteinaceous materials and lipids. The effect of different concentrations of protein and lipid on filter performance was interpreted in terms of filter life, particle retention efficiency and dirt holding capacity.

In order to examine the early structural response of a complex bacterial community to oil pollution, a kinetic study of the crude oil impact on bacterial communities inhabiting sediments from the contaminated Etang-de-Berre lagoon was performed. The sediments were maintained in slurries in presence or absence of crude oil and the kinetic study was carried out 14 days. During this period, 54% of crude oil was biodegraded showing the importance of the early degradation step. The metabolically active community (16S rRNA transcript analysis) was immediately impacted by the oil input, observed as an apparent decrease of species richness in the first hour of incubation. Nevertheless, this shift was quickly reversed, highlighting a fast, adaptative and efficient response of the metabolically active bacterial population. The high proportion of sequences related to hydrocarbonoclastic strains or petroleum-associated clones in active oiled community was consistent with significant increasing numbers of cultivable hydrocarbonoclastic bacteria at the end of the experiment.

In spite of having been used as a propulsion system throughout times, nowadays it can be a source of danger in extreme situations. High wind speeds can also represent an economic driver, since, on the one hand, wind energy can be harvested from off-shore wind farms, but on the other hand fishing activity or, for example, off-shore fish farms are affected. The predominant winds in the North Atlantic (the Westerlies) have a basin-wide scale, and are highest during winter.During summer, when the large scale forcing is weaker, mesoscale and local wind features prevail. That is the case of coastal jets. During summer the Iberian Peninsula is under the effect of the semi-permanent Azores High and of a thermal low pressure system in-land. This synoptic pattern drives a seasonal northerly wind along the west coast of the Iberian Peninsula. This regional wind is an example of a coastal jet.An insight on the climatology of the Iberian Peninsula coastal jet (IPCJ) is presented, based on a regional reanalysis produced with the WRF mesoscale model for the period 1989-2007. It is shown that although the IPCJ are more frequent in the south area of the west coast of Iberia, in the north area coastal jets are stronger (with higher wind speeds). The dynamic structure of the IPCJ is studied through the analysis of a strong summer IPCJ event along west coasts of Galicia and north of Portugal (at 3 km horizontal resolution).

The near real-time (within 24 h) capability of the Argos satellite system can aid dynamic ocean management of human activities by informing when animals enter wind farms, shipping lanes, and other intensive use zones. This capability also facilitates the use of ocean observations from animal-borne sensors in operational ocean forecasting models. Such near real-time data provision requires rapid, reliable quality control to deal with error-prone Argos locations. Methods We formulate a continuous-time state-space model to filter the three types of Argos location data (Least-Squares, Kalman filter, and Kalman smoother), accounting for irregular timing of observations. Our model is deliberately simple to ensure speed and reliability for automated, near real-time quality control of Argos location data. We validate the model by fitting to Argos locations collected from 61 individuals across 7 marine vertebrates and compare model-estimated locations to contemporaneous GPS locations. We then test assumptions that Argos Kalman filter/smoother error ellipses are unbiased, and that Argos Kalman smoother location accuracy cannot be improved by subsequent state-space modelling. Results Estimation accuracy varied among species with Root Mean Squared Errors usually <5 km and these decreased with increasing data sampling rate and precision of Argos locations. Including a model parameter to inflate Argos error ellipse sizes in the north - south direction resulted in more accurate location estimates. Finally, in some cases the model appreciably improved the accuracy of the Argos Kalman smoother locations, which should not be possible if the smoother is using all available information. Conclusions Our model provides quality-controlled locations from Argos Least-Squares or Kalman filter data with accuracy similar to or marginally better than Argos Kalman smoother data that are only available via fee-based reprocessing. Simplicity and ease of use make the model suitable both for automated quality control of near real-time Argos data and for manual use by researchers working with historical Argos data.",,,,,,,,,52,1,0,0,41,0,59,,,2051-3933,,,,,,,,,,,"Macquarie Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Sydney, NSW, AustraliaCSIRO Oceans & Atmosphere, Hobart, Tas, AustraliaUniv Calif Santa Cruz, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USAUniv Exeter, Environm & Sustainabil Inst, Penryn, EnglandUniv St Andrews, Scottish Oceans Inst, Sea Mammal Res Unit, St Andrews, Fife, ScotlandCNRS, Chize, FranceGovt Western Australia, Dept Biodivers Conservat & Attract, Kensington, NSW, AustraliaUniv Tasmania, Inst Marine & Antarctic Studies, Hobart, Tas, AustraliaSydney Inst Marine Sci, Mosman, Australia",Govt Western Australia,,,2020-08-06,WOS:000552302200001,32695402,

The paedomorphic (neotenous) smooth newts in Aremark, Ostfold (Norway). - Fauna 64(2-4): 50-59 In May 2010, two paedomorphic (neotenous) smooth newts Triturus (Lissotriton) vulgaris were captured in a little lake in Aremark, Ostfold in southeastern Norway. One of them was a one year old and 49 mm long larva; the other one was a female of about 80 mm total length. The larva was kept in an aquarium for two years, without metamorphosing, and in May 2012 released in the lake from where it was captured. At the time of release it measured 104 mm and showed clearly female secondary sex characteristics, except that the grey-spotted belly had no orange colouringNew investigations of the lake were made in May/ June and in September 2012, when a high number of paedomorphs was found, consisting of adult and subadult newts of both sexes and many larvae. Adult paedomorphs lack reddish or orange colour on their bellies. However, also normal and normally coloured, metamorphic newts exist at the place; which morph is in majority is not known.The locality, here called, Salamandertjern, is about 15 000 m(2) large and situated ca. 220 m above sea level. The surroundings are mostly rocky hills with spruce or pine forest, which in part has been logged. The aquatic vegetation is sparse. In 2010, the Ca2+ concentration of the water was 4.5 mg/L, and the pH was 67. About 20 years earlier, in 1989, the lake had a Ca2+ concentration of only 1.3 mg/L and a pH as low as 4.6 At that time newts were not found, and the lake had barely amphibians at all. The reason for the rise in Ca2+ and pH is the liming of the lake, which started about 2001-2002 and continued (so far) till 2010. The hydrographical history of the lake thus indicates that the newt population there is probably younger than year 2001, and the paedomorphy still younger.Facultative paedomorphic newts are very rare in Scandinavia, and only one known record up till now (before the present records) has been made in Norway. Paedomorphy has a genetic component and appears now and then in normal newt populations. Under special environmental conditions, paedomorphic individuals can then be selected before normal, metamorphic individuals. Factors that have been associated with paedomorphy in newts are: Low concentration of iodine- or high concentration of calcium etc. in the water, permanent aquatic sites with abundance of prey surrounded by an unfavourable terrestrial habitat, short activity season on land, steep banks surrounding the lake, and - most important: no, or only few, effective predators in the water.The most important threat to the very special and vulnerable smooth newt population in Salamandertjern is the (illegal) release of fish. Secondly, also a drop in pH as a result of terminated liming practice may be serious. In addition, there is a possibility that the area will be developed by building a wind power plant, i.e. a high number of wind turbines, and also of new roads with increased traffic.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,,,0014-8881,,,,,,,,,,,"NTNU Vitenskapsmuseet, NO-7491 Trondheim, Norway",,,,2011-01-01,BCI:BCI201300253801,,

The numerical Marine Aerosol Concentration Model (MACMod) supported the analysis by confirming that the concentration gradients are more pronounced under stable conditions and that aerosol plumes are then more confined to the surface. The model also confirmed the experimental observations made during two boat runs along the offshore wind vector that surf-generated aerosols are efficiently advected out to sea over several tens of kilometers.

We used radiotracer (C-14 and S-35) techniques to determine rates of AOM and SR over depth in sediment cores. Abundant mats of white and orange Beggiatoa spp. were common in areas of active seepage and these sediments were enriched in hydrogen sulfide and methane. In cores collected from areas without Beggiatoa or hydrate, concentrations of redox metabolites showed little variation over depth and these sites were inferred to be areas of low seepage. Integrated AOM rates were low in Beggiatoa-free cores (<0.05 mmol m(-2) day(-1)) and averaged 2.8 +/- 4.6 mmol m(-2) day(-1) in seep cores that contained Beggiatoa or gas hydrate. Integrated SR rates were also low in Beggiatoa-free cores (<1 mmol m(-2) day(-1)) and averaged 54 +/- 94 mmol m(-2) day(-1) in cores with Beggiatoa or hydrate. Rates of SR generally exceeded rates of AOM and the two processes were loosely coupled, suggesting that the majority of SR at Gulf of Mexico hydrocarbon seep sites is likely fueled by the oxidation of other organic matter, possibly other hydrocarbons and oil, rather than by AOM.

In moderately oiledmarshes, surface soil total petroleum hydrocarbon concentrations were similar to 70 mg g(-1) nine months after the spill. Though initial impacts of moderate oiling were evident, Spartina alterniflora and Juncus roemerianus aboveground biomass and total live belowground biomass were equivalent to reference marshes within 24-30 months post spill. In contrast, heavily oiled marsh plants did not fully recover from oiling with surface soil total petroleum hydrocarbon concentrations that exceeded 500 mg g(-1) nine months after oiling. Initially, heavy oiling resulted in near complete plant mortality, and subsequent recovery of live aboveground biomass was only 50% of reference marshes 42 months after the spill. Heavy oiling also changed the vegetation structure of shoreline marshes from a mixed Spartina-Juncus community to predominantly Spartina; live Spartina aboveground biomass recovered within 2-3 years, however, Juncus showed no recovery. In addition, live belowground biomass (0-12 cm) in heavily oiled marshes was reduced by 76% three and a half years after the spill. Detrimental effects of heavy oiling on marsh plants also corresponded with significantly lower soil shear strength, lower sedimentation rates, and higher vertical soil-surface erosion rates, thus potentially affecting shoreline salt marsh stability.

Over a 10-km coastal zone, Bowen ratios (beta) decrease exponentially inland, 2.7 fold during onshore winds and 1.8 fold during offshore winds. This decrease is due both to boundary layer adjustments to a new surface under onshore winds and to horizontal and vertical convergence and divergence in the atmosphere under all wind conditions. Horizontal convergence and divergence is most evident near the coast. The former is most common during periods of low wind speed and the latter during stronger winds. The strongest mesoscale advective impacts on the turbulent fluxes occur within 10 km of the coast.

A program was initiated in 1999 to design and assemble a station which will monitor physical and chemical parameters of the sea water and sea-floor sediments on a more-or-less continuous basis over an extended period of time. It is planned that an operational station will be installed in at least a thousand meters of water by 2004.The heart of the station will be a net of vertical arrays of sensors. Each array will occupy the lower portion of the water column and a hole bored into the sea floor. Sensors will include hydrophones to record compression waves, thermistors to measure temperature within the water and the sediment, and optic fibers connected to an optical spectrometer to identify and quantify hydrocarbon gases. The lowermost sensor of each array will be a three-component accelerometer pushed into the sediments at the bottom of the hole to record compression and shear waves.Peripheral sensors will include a sea-floor positioning system and an acoustic doppler current profiler. Also, if sufficient electrical power is available, several video systems with pan and tilt capability will be installed. The video images would be posted on a web site in near-to-real time and made available for educational and public outreach purposes.Retrieving the huge volume of data that the station will produce is not a trivial problem. The most likely scenario is that, at first, the data will be recorded on the sea floor and periodically downloaded by an underwater vehicle. Eventually, the station will be connected via optic fiber to a surface structure, such as an oil platform, and the data transmitted in near-to-real time to a shore facility at the Stennis Space Center.The station will initiate collection of a data base for assessing and modeling stability of the sea floor and factors associated with the formation and dissociation of gas hydrates. This data base will also be available for planning hydrate exploration and, eventually, for analyzing the impact of producing hydrates from the ocean floor. It will be possible to expand the capabilities of the station to include biological monitoring.

However, the service performance of metal materials and structures is gradually degenerating with the increase of service life due to the rapid growth of corrosion damages. Thus, the coupled effects for corrosion damage in reliability analysis should be considered urgently. Then, the purpose of this paper is to develop the corrosion damage physical model and the corresponding reliability analysis methods, which consider the coupled effect of corrosion damage. Design/methodology/approach A failure physical model, considering the coupled effect of pitting growth, crack and crack propagation, is presented in this paper. Sequentially, the corrosion reliability with respect to pitting physical damage can be investigated. The presented pitting damage physical model is formulated as time-variant performance limit state functions, which include the crack transition, crack growth and fracture failure mechanics. The first-passage failure criterion is used to construct the corrosion reliability framework, involving in the pitting damage model with the increase of service life. Findings Results demonstrate that the multiplicative dimensional reduction (MDR) method behaves much better than FORM no matter in accuracy or efficiency. The proposed corrosion reliability method is applicable for dealing with the damage failure model of the structural pitting corrosion. Originality/value The MDR method is used to calculate the corrosion reliability index of a given structure with fewer function calls. Finally, an aeronautical metal material is used to demonstrate the efficiency and precision of the proposed corrosion reliability method when the failure physical model considering the coupled effects of mechanical stresses and corrosion environment is adopted.",,,,,,,,,7,0,0,0,0,0,7,,,0003-5599,1758-4221,,,,,,,,,,"Xi An Jiao Tong Univ, State Key Lab Strength & Vibrat Mech Struct, Xian, Shaanxi, Peoples R ChinaXi An Jiao Tong Univ, Xian, Shaanxi, Peoples R China",,,,2019-09-06,WOS:000482450700001,,

Fossiliferous strata abruptly overlie part of a stepped-back margin of the Sturgeon Lake carbonate platform (Leduc Formation), southeast of the Peace River Arch. Fossils are flattened organic fragments, some representing nearly complete specimens; the largest algal fragment is about 3 cm in length and 1 mm in width. Tentative comparisons are made with some Paleozoic algae; however, some of the Sturgeon Lake flora may be new species or genera. Preliminary examination of selected cores from the Ireton Formation and organic-rich Duvernay Formation in central Alberta indicates a widespread distribution of algal-derived organic matter within Upper Devonian basinal strata.The geological relevance of non-calcified algae to Devonian carbonate platforms and basins is postulated in three cases. 1) Their presence in slope sediments may indicate that algal lawns flourished in muddy, upper slope environments. Fossils accumulated either in situ, buried by sediments derived from farther upslope, or were ripped up and quickly buried within downslope resedimented deposits. 2) All, or some, algal fragments may have been swept from the adjacent carbonate platform during storms. Prolific shallow water algal growth may have occurred simultaneously with local or regional oceanic crises, when shallow water carbonate production either decreased or was shut down. The present position of fossil algae, therefore, would mark a bedding surface that is stratigraphically equivalent to an intraplatform disconformity. 3) Regardless of the original environment, a sufficient accumulation of non-calcified algae in slope strata represents a viable petroleum source proximal to carbonate platforms.",,,,,,,,,3,0,0,0,2,0,3,,,0007-4802,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1990-12-01,WOS:A1990ET24900004,,

Pipistrellus nathusii occurred at all sites (north to 61 degrees N in Finland), while the other species were scarcer, particularly at the northernmost sites. The status of the recorded individuals is unknown. However, the activity most likely was of migrating individuals or individuals on migration stopover, because very few observations were made during the maternity period. Spring activity occurred predominantly in May, with the median observation date of P. nathusii 20 days earlier in the south (Germany) than in the north (Finland). Autumn migration was observed throughout August and September and activity that may or may not indicate migration was also observed in October and November. The median date of such activity in autumn usually occurred in September and without any significant difference in timing in relation to latitude. Migratory bats in the Baltic area apparently move on a broad front in most cases. The estimated speed of migration for P. nathusii in spring was 55 km/day.

Its high organic content potentially fuels a myriad of renewable products of industrial interest. However, the biotechnological exploitation of molasses is mainly hampered by the high concentration of salts, an issue that is nowadays tackled through dilution. In the present study, the performance of microbial communities derived from marine sediment was compared to that of communities from a terrestrial environment (anaerobic digester sludge). The aim was to test whether adaptation to salinity represented an advantage for fermenting molasses into renewable chemicals such as volatile fatty acids (VFAs) although high sugar concentrations are uncommon to marine sediment, contrary to anaerobic digesters.Results: Terrestrial and marine microbial communities were enriched in consecutive batches at different initial pH values (pH(i); either 6 or 7) and molasses dilutions (equivalent to organic loading rates (OLRs) of 1 or 5 g(COD) L-1 d(-1)) to determine the best VFA production conditions. Marine communities were supplied with NaCl to maintain their native salinity. Due to molasses inherent salinity, terrestrial communities experienced conditions comparable to brackish or saline waters (20-47 mS cm(-1)), while marine conditions resembled brine waters (> 47 mS cm(-1)). Enrichments at optimal conditions of OLR 5 g(COD) L-1 d(-1) and pHi 7 were transferred into packed-bed biofilm reactors operated continuously. The reactors were first operated at 5 g(COD) L-1 d(-1), which was later increased to OLR 10 gCOD L-1 d(-1). Terrestrial and marine reactors had different gas production and community structures but identical, remarkably high VFA bioconversion yields (above 85%) which were obtained with conductivities up to 90 mS cm(-1). COD-to-VFA conversion rates were comparable to the highest reported in literature while processing other organic leftovers at much lower salinities.Conclusions: Although salinity represents a major driver for microbial community structure, proper acclimation yielded highly efficient systems treating molasses, irrespective of the inoculum origin. Selection of equivalent pathways in communities derived from different environments suggests that culture conditions select for specific functionalities rather than microbial representatives. Mass balances, microbial community composition, and biochemical analysis indicate that biomass turnover rather than methanogenesis represents the main limitation to further increasing VFA production with molasses. This information is relevant to moving towards molasses fermentation to industrial application.",,,,,,,,,14,0,0,0,4,0,14,,,,1754-6834,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Ghent, CMET, Coupure Links 653, B-9000 Ghent, BelgiumUniv Bath, CSCT, Bath BA2 7AY, Avon, EnglandAarhus Univ, Ctr Geomicrobiol, Ny Munkegade 116, DK-8000 Aarhus C, Denmark",,,,2017-03-22,WOS:000393843300001,28163780,

In particular, this study focuses on the investigation of the roll response of FLNG hull in free-decay motions, white noise waves and also in irregular waves. Model tests of the FLNG system in 60%H filling condition excited by both white noise waves and irregular waves combined with steady wind and current have been carried out. Response Amplitude Operators (RAOs) and time histories of the responses are obtained for sway, roll and yaw motions. Obvious Low Frequency (LF) components of the roll motions are observed, which may be out of expectation. To facilitate the physical understanding of this phenomenon, we filter the roll motions at the period of 30 s into two parts: the Wave Frequency (WF) motions and the Low Frequency (LF) motions respectively. The results indicate that the LF motions are closely related to the sway and yaw motions. Possible reasons for the presence of the LF motions of roll have been discussed in detail, through the comparison with the sway and yaw motions. As for the numerical part, the simulation of the modeled case is conducted with the help of the software SESAMA (R). A good agreement between experiments and calculations is reported within the scope of trends.

These movements are not extensive enough to be considered a seasonal inshore-offshore migration. The gradual move to deeper water in autumn appears to be mainly in response to increased turbulence due to storm conditions at this time and the return to shallower water in spring results mainly from increased activity due to increasing temperatures and random movement to shallower, warmer water where they tend to remain. Nocturnal activity was low at dusk but the peak level appeared to be reached within 2-3 h after darkness. There was very little activity during the hour before dawn but it was not clear from the observations if activity continued at a high level throughout most of the period of darkness and dropped very quickly or if it tapered off gradually to the very low pre-dawn level. Territorial behavior varies seasonally with lobsters being virtually nontransient or resident during the winter because of inactivity and much more transient during the summer.

Expanded graphite (EG) has been considered as an excellent platform to remove contaminated oil from aqueous solution through a facile adsorption route. As an innovative approach, the decoration of magnetic components, namely, MnFe2O4, into graphite layers was taken into account for facilitating phase separation under magnetic field which resulted into an easy collection of the used adsorbents in a large scale. The expanded graphite/manganese ferrite composites were prepared from Vietnamese graphite flakes via a two-stage process. Characterization was performed using Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM), Fourier-Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR), X-Ray Powder Diffraction (XRD), Vibrating Sample Magnetometer (VSM), Energy-Dispersive X-ray (EDS), and nitrogen adsorption/desorption analysis. The adsorption behavior of EG-MnFe2O4 for widespread used heavy oils, including diesel oil and crude oil, was investigated under the effects of adsorption conditions, i.e., contact time, loaded oil dosage, and salinity of mixing oil and water. The obtained results showed successful incorporation of MnFe2O4 into graphite sheets and no considerable change on the worm-like structure of EG. The results also showed that incorporated manganese ferrites enhanced the magnetism EG up to 16 emu/g, which made the recovery of used adsorbent conveniently. The EG-MnFe2O4 adsorbents exhibited the strong adsorption ability toward diesel oil (32.20 +/- 0.46 g DO/g EG) and crude oil (33.07 +/- 0.33 g CO/g EG).

In so doing, it challenges the strict interpretation of the precautionary principle which has been crystallised by the EU judiciary under the regime of Article 6(3) of the Habitats Directive and suggests embracing adaptive management as a better methodology to enhance the outcomes of the appropriate assessment in the face of uncertain impacts on Natura 2000 sites and their qualifying features. The aim of this study is solution-based: it seeks to improve the implementation of the assessment procedure of the Habitats Directive before it truly becomes an 'obstacle course' for offshore renewable energy developers.",,,,,,,,,10,0,0,0,2,0,10,,,0301-4215,1873-6777,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Coll Cork, Environm Res Inst, MaREI Ctr, Ctr Marine & Renewable Energy Ireland, Beaufort Bldg,Haulbowline Rd, Ringaskiddy, Cork, IrelandUniv Coll Cork, Sch Law, Coll Rd, Ringaskiddy, Cork, Ireland",,,,2019-06-04,WOS:000468012900045,,

Nearshore Louisiana exemplifies the strong influence of the Mississippi and Atchafalaya rivers. Coastal salinities, temperatures, turbidities, and nutrients are directly affected, and the zone annually experiences the second largest eutrophication-induced marine hypoxic event. During the summers of 2013-14 we assessed the extent of river influence across the nearshore region of the Louisiana Continental Shelf by sampling water quality in water depths of 3.7-18 m. Single-variable spatial analyses and multivariate factor analysis suggested that the nearshore zone comprises three functionally-distinct hydrographic regions. Differences in bathymetry and freshwater input associated with delta morphology explained significant differences in mixing and stratification patterns among East, Central, and West regions of nearshore Louisiana. Additionally, intraregional differences occurred between waters overlying sandy shoals and those overlying the surrounding muddy sediments and with wind. Mean interregional surface-to-bottom density differences were 0.9, 3.2, and 9.2 kg m(-3), (West, Central, and East, respectively) and intraregional density differences were 2.1 over sand and 4.3 kg m(-3) over mud. The mean vertical extent of hypoxia (DO < 50% saturation) over sand was 0.6 m lower than over mud. Mean DO saturation was 33.1% and 21.4% greater over sand than over mud in the Central and West regions, respectively, but did not differ in the East. Mean DO saturation was up to 57.6% higher with southeasterly rather than northwesterly winds.

It presents an economically attractive possible solution for the continuously increasing energy demand of Lebanon. However, the stochastic behavior of wind speed leads to significant disharmony between wind energy production and electricity demand. Hence, the prospect of creating a combined wind-hydro energy station is found to be a vital issue. This paper is an attempt to analyze the design of a pumping station and the performance of a hybrid wind-hydro power plant, in two dams in Lebanon (Quaraoun and Chabrouh), in order to choose the most suitable dam to store the energy surplus produced by wind power at night. An evaluation of the amount of water that could be pumped in both dams and the energy that could be produced from the stored electricity surplus are carried out in this paper, in order to select the most suitable dam to implement the hydro pumped storage power plant and store the electricity surplus. It is shown that the energy that could be produced in the dam of Chabrouh varies between 17 MWh and 698 MWh, while in the dam of Quaraoun is between 17 MWh and 768 MWh. An analysis of the cost of the energy produced by wind turbines per kWh and the produced water per m(3) are carried out in this paper as well. Copyright (C) 2016, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC.

Long inaccessible and invisible offshore, advances in technology have today propelled the sunken past into the consciousness of commercial archaeology. Arguably among no other form of heritage assets are archaeology and environment so complexly embedded. Lessons from the recent past have increasingly compelled developers to incorporate surveys of maritime seascapes into environmental impact assessments (coastal construction, sealane deepening, aggregate dredging, wind farms, and oil and gas pipeline and fiber-optic cable laying). Qualitative decisions about what to protect in situ, avoid, or excavate requires an objective understanding of significance assessment in relation to risk. The high profile of the United Nations Organization for Education, Science and Culture (UNESCO) Convention on the Protection of the Underwater Cultural Heritage exerts increasing pressures on governments worldwide to seek sustainable development. Demersal bottom fishing, World War II shipwreck hull oil leakage, and global warming are newly emerged risks that require expanded heritage recognition.

Results showed that two sea breezes developed, one from Table Bay late in the morning, and the other from False Bay later in the afternoon. The coastal low strengthened and deflected the sea breeze from Table Bay towards the south and south-east of the study area, while the offshore large-scale circulation hindered the development of the sea breeze in the opposite direction over False Bay and delayed its movement towards land.

However, although MRE developments could offer remote island communities significant economic benefits, limited research exists on community attitudes towards MRE or, crucially, the main factors shaping responses. Research in the Shetlands, Orkneys and Scillies (UK) revealed generally positive attitudes towards MRE but also that attitudes were strongly shaped by place-related values, not just the direct socioeconomic and environmental credentials of proposed locations. Developments that complemented established place values were more likely to gain acceptance whereas conflicts with these values was often a major reason for concerns about MRE. The results are used to argue for greater attention to place-related values in decision-making and community engagement on MRE developments.

The method can handle a very large number of constant hydrodynamic panels in a reasonable CPU time. The scheme uses a consistent way of the data passing in which the energy is conserved between the generalized modal damping and the radiation waves if the hydrodynamic analysis is accurate enough. In addition, the scheme satisfies the generalized Haskind-Newman relation between the modal diffraction force and the Kochin function. These properties are important to ensure the numerical accuracy. The numerical convergence and the accuracy of the method are demonstrated in various ways including the comparison with experimental data.

In this work, a hybrid analytical computational fluid dynamic model based on Blade Element Momentum theory is implemented: since the turbine blades are not present in the grid, the flow is slowed down by means of bottom frictions applied to the seabed corresponding to forces equal and opposite to those that the blades would experience during their rotation. This simplified approach allowed reproducing the turbine behavior for both mechanical power generation and the turbine effect on the surrounding flow field.

The effects of the vaporization temperature, thermal pretreatment, internal gas flow and use of nitric acid as matrix modifier on the composition of the vapor phase were investigated using tube, platform and filter furnaces. Moreover, solutions of the main components of sea water (chlorides and sulfates of sodium, magnesium and calcium) were vaporized to clarify the contribution of each salt to the overall absorption. The addition of nitric acid to sea water led to partial suppression of the intense NaCl bands and to the appearance of oxygen containing species. Total suppression of chlorides could not be attained even with high concentration of nitric acid (more than 8% m/m). Molecular bands attributed to NaCl, NaOx, MgCl, CaCl, SOx and NO species were observed at different stages of the vaporization process. In the filter furnace, the bands of the oxygen containing molecules were less intense due to the reaction with carbon. An intense spectral continuum, attributed to light scattering, was decreased with the filter furnace relative to that observed for the tube and platform furnaces with the gas stop mode of operation.

The areal coverage of the Breid Bay polynya is significantly related to the strength of katabatic winds, which maintain their strength over the coastal sea due to land topography favoring for their confluence, thereby being capable of removing newly formed ice. Land fast ice in the eastern part of the bay also plays an additional role in the formation mechanism. It is also found that the areal coverage of coastal polynyas in this region fluctuate coherently. Moreover, these fluctuations correspond to the synoptic index, which measures the strength of the offshore wind, with their peaks closely associated with the areal peaks. These facts strongly suggest the influence of synoptic scale weather on the formation and maintenance of polynyas in this region.",,,,,,,,,12,0,0,0,3,0,14,,,0916-8370,,,,,,,,,,,"Toshiba Co., Shimoishigami 1385, Ohtawara, Tochigi 224, Japan",,,,1996-01-01,BCI:BCI199699084916,,

North America has significant in-stream energy resources, and hydrokinetic electric power technologies to harness those resources have the potential to make a significant contribution to U.S. electricity needs by adding as much as 120 TWh/year from rivers alone to the present hydroelectric power generation capacity. Additionally, tidal and ocean current resources in the U.S. respectively contain 438 TWh/year and 163 TWh/year of extractable power. Among their attractive features, in-stream hydrokinetic operations do not contribute to greenhouse gas emissions or other air pollution and have less visual impact than wind turbines. Since these systems do no utilize dams the way traditional hydropower systems typically do, their impact on the environment will differ, and a small but growing number of studies support conclusions regarding those impacts. Potential environmental impacts include altered water quality, altered sediment deposition, altered habitats, direct impact on biota, and navigability of waterways.

Scleractinian corals are an important functional component of tropical reefs and the abundance, diversity and resilience of coral communities can be used as an indicator of ecosystem health. In this paper, we report the effects of petroleum products, including mater accommodated fractions (WAF) of crude oil, PFW and dispersant (Corexit 9527), on fertilization and larval metamorphosis of the widespread scleractinian coral, Acropora millepora (Ehrenberg, 1834) in laboratory-based assays. At 20% v/v PFW fertilization was inhibited by 25%. This concentration was equivalent 0.0721 mg l(-1) total hydrocarbon (THC). In contrast, larval metamorphosis was more sensitive to this effluent, with 98% metamorphosis inhibited at the same concentration. Crude oil WAF did not inhibit fertilization of gametes until dispersant was introduced. Dispersed oil was slightly more toxic to fertilization than dispersant alone, suggesting toxicity to that event may be additive. The minimum concentration of dispersed oil which inhibited fertilization was 0.0325 mg l(-1) THC. Larval metamorphosis was more sensitive than fertilization to crude oil. Although crude oil and dispersant inhibited larval metamorphosis individually, this toxicity was magnified when larvae were exposed to combinations of both. Crude oil inhibited metamorphosis at 0.0824 mg l(-1) THC and at 0.0325 mg l(-1) THC when dispersed in 10% v/v (dispersant/oil). Management of petroleum-related risks to spawning corals should consider not only the occurrence of the annual coral spawning event, but also the subsequent 1-3-week period during which most larval metamorphosis and recruitment occur.

Potential applications include the study of cold water coral reef communities, ecosystems from underwater canyons, pipeline and harbor monitoring, or the inspection of wind turbine foundations. The project introduced and advanced a novel concept of an underwater robotic system composed of a number of mobile robot modules (nodes), carrying complementary sensors for perception of the environment. Instead of being physically coupled, the modules are connected via communication links that allow a flow of essential information among them. Without rigid links, the so-called MORPH Supra-Vehicle can reconfigure itself and adapt according to the environment and mission goals, responding, for example, to the shape of the terrain, including vertical walls. The flexibility allows for more optimal positioning of each sensor, increased number of simultaneous viewpoints, and generally high-resolution data collection.MORPH is aimed at providing a proof-of-concept demonstration of such capabilities, an effort that includes technological developments in many of the subfields of underwater technology.

S. Department of Interior (DOI), Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) to generate a Best Management Practices (BMPs) document on sub-seabed geologic sequestration of carbon dioxide (CO2) below the U. S. outer continental shelf. The team consists of scientists, engineers, lawyers, and business managers from academia, private industry, and State of Texas government from the following institutions: (1) Gulf Coast Carbon Center at the Bureau of Economic Geology (BEG), (2) Det Norske Veritas (USA) Inc (DNV), (3) Wood Group Mustang and sister company Wood Group Kenny (Wood Group), (4) Texas General Land Office (GLO), (5) Harte Research Institute for Gulf of Mexico Studies at Texas A&M University-Corpus Christi (HRI), and (6) The University of Houston Law Center. Individual team members have expertise in carbon sequestration monitoring, CO2-pipeline design and construction, and domestic and international offshore environmental policy. The BMPs will be reviewed by external experts after it is generated and before being submitted to BOEM. The purpose of the BMPs will be to provide technical guidance to BOEM and BSEE (U. S. DOI Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement) to establish regulatory guidelines for offshore components of future U. S. Carbon Capture and Storage, which is sometimes referred to as sequestration, (CCS) industry.Sub-seabed geologic sequestration (GS) is the process whereby CO2 captured from large volume industrial sources (e. g., power plants, oil refineries) will be (1) compressed to supercritical state and transported via pipeline to offshore injection wells, and (2) injected into geologic strata deep (thousands of feet) below the seafloor. Objectives of the CO2 injection will be for pure sequestration (i.e., long-term storage of CO2 in subseafloor saline reservoirs) or sequestration combined with enhanced oil recovery (EOR). Sub-seabed geologic sequestration is very different from ocean dumping (i.e. dissolution of CO2 into circulating seawater) or injection of CO2 into deep water, shallow sub-seabed sediments. Some researchers proposed in the past that shallow subseafloor depths (< 1,000 ft) were sufficient for permanent CO2 storage in deep marine environments (> 11,000 ft water depth) (e. g., House et al., 2006). However, the shallow sedimentary subseafloor environment could become unstable and allow release of CO2 into ocean water, the end result of which would be ocean dumping. One mechanism of seafloor instability could be the release of gas from hydrates owing to pressure and temperature perturbations that may be introduced by shallow drilling and CO2 injection. Furthermore, the logistics of transporting CO2 hundreds of miles offshore to areas with sufficient water depths for storage in shallow subsea sediments would probably not be economically feasible. We want to emphasize that subseabed GS of CO2 is not ocean dumping.One of the biggest concerns for onshore GS is the potential to impact shallow drinking water resources. Injecting CO2 deep below the seafloor will avoid this potential consequence. But there are sensitive marine environments of concern in offshore settings, protection of which is critical. Environmental monitoring of marine ecosystems (nearshore, along CO2 pipeline corridors, and outer continental shelf) and subseafloor geological strata in which CO2 will be injected will be a large component of the BMPs. Topics being included in the BMPs, a draft of which will be submitted to BOEM in June of 2013, are: (1) site selection and characterization, (2) risk analysis, (3) project planning and execution, (4) environmental monitoring, (5) mitigation, (6) inspection and auditing, (7) reporting requirements, (8) emergency response and contingency planning, (9) decommissioning and site closure, and (10) legal issues. Where possible, we are using existing regulatory, policy, and technical guidance documents as a starting point for the BMPs. We think the most likely location for initiation of U. S. offshore geologic sequestration of CO2 will be in the western or central sectors of the Gulf of Mexico where extensive offshore oil and gas infrastructure already exists. Academic members of our project team are actively working on criteria for site selection [1]. However, private industry is also assessing the feasibility of offshore geologic sequestration below the Atlantic seafloor [2].",,,,,MTS/IEEE Oceans ConferenceMTS/IEEE Oceans Conference,"OCT 14-19, 2012OCT 14-19, 2012",IEEE; Marine Technol Soc (MTS); IEEE OES (IEEE/OES)IEEE; Marine Technol Soc (MTS); IEEE OES (IEEE/OES),"Virginia Beach, VAVirginia Beach, VA",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,978-1-4673-0829-8,,,,,,,,,"Univ Texas Austin, Bur Econ Geol, Jackson Sch Geosci, Austin, TX 78712 USA",,,,2013-05-05,WOS:000315350300189,,
B,"Klein, David R.","Simon, Carolyn; Arris, Lelani; Heal, Bill",,,,,,,,,Management and conservation of wildlife in a changing Arctic environment.,,,,,,,,Arctic Climate Impact Assessment.,,,,,,,,597,648,,,,,,,,,,,Book chapter,2005,2005,"Climate changes in the Arctic in the past have had major influences on the ebb and flow in availability of wildlife to indigenous peoples and thus have influenced their distribution and the development of their cultures.Trade in animal parts, especially skins and ivory of marine mammals, and trapping and sale of fur-bearing animals go far back in time. Responsibility for management and conservation of wildlife in the Arctic falls heavily on the residents of the Arctic, but also on the global community that shares in the use of arctic resources. A sense of global stewardship toward the Arctic is critical for the future of arctic wildlife and its peoples. This chapter, drawing on Chapters 7 to 9, emphasizes that throughout most of the Arctic, natural ecosystems are still functionally intact and that threats to wildlife typical for elsewhere in the world - extensive habitat loss through agriculture, industry, and urbanization - are absent or localized. There is increasing evidence that contaminants from the industrialized world to the south are entering arctic food chains, threatening the health and reproduction of some marine mammals and birds and the humans who include them in their diets. Protection of critical wildlife habitats in the Arctic is becoming recognized by those living inside as well as outside the Arctic as essential for both the conservation of arctic wildlife and its sustainable harvest by residents of the Arctic. Management of wildlife and its conservation, as practiced in most of the Arctic, is conceptually different to that at lower latitudes where management efforts often focus on manipulation of habitats to benefit wildlife. The history of over-exploitation of marine mammals and birds for oil and skins to serve interests outside the Arctic is now being balanced by international efforts toward conservation of the flora and fauna of the Arctic, focusing on maintaining the Arctic's biodiversity and valuing its ecosystem components and relationships. Case studies from Russia and Canada focusing on harvest strategies and management of caribou (wild reindeer) highlight the complex nature of this species. One reports the development of a co-management system, involving shared responsibility between users of the wildlife and the government entities with legal authority over wildlife, giving local residents a greater role in wildlife management. Throughout much of the Arctic, harvesting of wildlifefor food and furs through hunting and trapping has been the most conspicuous influence that residents of the Arctic have had on arctic wildlife in recent decades. It was the overexploitation of wildlife during the period of arctic exploration and whaling, largely in the 18th and 19th centuries, that led to the extinction of the Steller sea cow in the Bering Sea and the great auk in the North Atlantic, and drastic stock reductionsand local extirpation of several other terrestrial and marine mammals and birds. In regions of the Eurasian Arctic, the adoption of reindeer herding by indigenous hunting cultures led to the extirpation or marked reduction of wild reindeer (caribou) and drastic reductions of wolves, lynx, wolverines, and other potential predators of reindeer. Heavy grazing pressure by semi-domestic reindeer along with encroachmentof timber harvest, agriculture, hydroelectric development, and oil and gas exploration have altered plant community structure in parts of the Fennoscandian and Russian Arctic. Large-scale extraction of nonrenewable resources accelerated in the Arctic during the latter half of the 20th century with impacts on some wildlife species and their habitats, especially in Alaska from oil production, in Canada from miningfor diamonds and other minerals, and in Russia primarily from extraction of nickel, apatite, phosphates, oil, and natural gas. Among the factors that influence arctic wildlife, harvest of wildlife through hunting and trapping is potentially the most manageable, at least at the local level. Indigenous peoples throughout much of the North are asserting their views and rights in management of wildlife, in part through gains inpolitical autonomy over their homelands. Arctic residents are now starting to influence when, where, and how industrial activity may take place in the Arctic. Part of this process has been the consolidation of the efforts of indigenous peoples across national boundaries to achieve a greater voice in management of wildlife and other resources through international groups such as the Inuit Circumpolar Conference andthe Indigenous Peoples Secretariat of the Arctic Council. The stage appears to be set for indigenous peoples of the Arctic to become major participants in the management and conservation of arctic wildlife. The legal institutions, however, encompassing treaty and land rights and other governmental agreements vary regionally and nationally throughout the Arctic, posing differing opportunities and constraints on howstructures for wildlife management and conservation can be developed. This chapter provides examples from throughout the Arctic which show that conservation of wildlife requires sound management and protection of wildlife habitats at the local, regional, and national levels if theproductivity of those wildlife populations upon which arctic peoples depend is to be sustained.Wildlife populations and their movements in both the marine and also stress the need for development of regional land and water use plans as a basis for protection of critical wildlife habitats in relation to existing and proposed human activities on the lands and waters of the Arctic. terrestrial environments transcend local, regional, and national boundaries, thus successful management and conservation of arctic wildlife requires international agreements and treaties. The chapter concludes that responsibility for maintaining the biodiversity that characterizes the Arctic, the quality of its natural environment,and the productivity of its wildlife populations must be exercised through global stewardship. Guidelines are provided for effective management and associated conservation of wildlife in a changing Arctic with emphasis on the complexity and limitations of managing wildlife in marine systems. The guidelines also stress the need for development of regional land and water use plans as a basis for protection of criticalwildlife habitats in relation to existing and proposed human activities on the lands and waters of the Arctic.",,,,,,,,,14,0,0,0,9,0,14,,,,,0-521-86509-3,,,,,,,,,"University of Alaska Fairbanks, USA",,,,2005-01-01,ZOOREC:ZOOR14208050617,,

In the present work, various sandwich structures have been manufactured using glass-fibre-reinforced polymer (GFRP) skins with three layers of poly(vinyl chloride) foam to form the core, with the densities of the foam layers ranging from 60 to 100kg/m(3). This study has investigated the effects on the quasi-static flexural and high-velocity impact properties of the sandwich structures of: (a) the density of the polymeric-foam core used and (b) grading the density of the foam core through its thickness. The digital image correlation technique has been employed to quantitatively measure the values of the deformation, strain and onset of damage. Under quasi-static three-point and four-point bend flexural loading, the use of a low-density layer in a graded-density configuration reduced the likelihood of failure of the sandwich structure by a sudden force drop, when compared with the core configuration using a uniform (i.e. homogenous) density layer. The high-velocity impact tests were performed on the sandwich structures using a gas-gun facility with a compliant, high-density polyethylene projectile. From these impact experiments, the graded-density foam core with the relatively low-density layer located immediately behind the front (i.e. impacted) GFRP skin was found to absorb more impact energy and possess an increased penetration resistance than a homogeneous core structure.",,,,,,,,,21,0,0,0,0,0,22,,,0022-2461,1573-4803,,,,,,,,,,"Imperial Coll London, Dept Mech Engn, South Kensington Campus, London SW7 2AZ, EnglandUniv Surrey, Dept Mech Engn Sci, Guildford GU2 7XH, Surrey, England",,,,2018-12-01,WOS:000445912300018,,

The goal is to develop a numerical tool that allows the study of the survivability of floating moored devices under highly energetic sea states, obtaining the optimum mooring layout to increase lifetime. The moorings are modelled by coupling DualSPHysics with MoorDyn, a lumped-mass mooring dynamics model. MoorDyn represents mooring line behaviour subject to axial elasticity, hydrodynamic forces in quiescent water, and vertical contact forces with the seabed. Calculated mooring tensions at the fairlead are added as external forces in order to compute the resulting response and motions of the floating structures in DualSPHysics. The coupled model has been validated against data from scale model tests generated during the experimental campaigns for the European MaRINET2 EsflOWC project.

At each stage of work with fuels (extraction, transportation, processing, storage, use, disposal), exists a substantial risk of their leakage, leading to an environmental pollution, destroying the existing ecosystems, and threatening biogeocenoses. Such leaks also lead to big losses for the economy. A lot of facilities involved in the oil production, refining or storage, is located in the oceanic waters. In case of emergency, accidents of anthropogenic nature at these facilities (breaking of pipes at the bottom of seas, collapse of tankers with petroleum products, accidents on oil platforms in the ocean, etc.), the problem of a fast, safe and cost-effective removal of contaminants from water surface becomes especially important. The aim of the project is to create nonwoven materials for the oil-water separation to simplify, accelerate and reduce the cost of eliminating the consequences of oil products leaked onto water surface. Electrospinning method, i.e. drawing fibers from a solution or polymer melt under high electric field, can be used for a production of such materials. Nonwoven materials produced by solution electrospinning are currently used in the aerosol filtration, but limited solubility of many commodity polymers (such as polyolefins) hinders their processing by solution technics. For the production of fibrous materials based on polyolefins, solvent-free melt electrospinning method can be used. One of the main requirements for materials for the oil-water separation is their oleophilicity and hydrophobicity, which, on the one hand, allows oil passing for their sorption, and on the other hand, do not pass water through the filter. Moreover, the material should have a high sorption capacity and the ability to subsequently desorb, allowing its regeneration for multiple usages. Finally, the material should be not toxic, easy to produce and cheap. All these requirements are met by non-woven microfibrous materials obtained by melt electrospinning of polymers (polyolefins, polyamides and their blends). These materials are characterized by high porosity (more than 90%), which will allow to sorb a large amount of oil in interfiber space, as well as by a high chemical resistance to most organic media. Nevertheless, despite the prospects of using non-woven polymeric fibrous materials obtained by melt electrospinning to purify water from oil, systematic studies on this subject have been limited in the literature to only a few publications, and most of the work is related to the use of materials obtained by solution electrospinning.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,18-73-00328,,,,,,,,National Research Centre Kurchatov Institute,National Research Centre Kurchatov Institute,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:15289007,,

Gap winds influence the entire shelf width ( > 200 km) northeast of Kodiak Island and extend an additional similar to 150 km off-shelf. Due to strong gradients in the along-shelf direction, they can result in vertical velocities in the ocean of over 20 m d(-1) due to Ekman pumping. The wind events also disrupt flow of the Alaska.

For example, in the German parts of the North and Baltic Sea approximately 1.6 million metric tons of toxic conventional explosives (TNT and others) and more than 5000 metric tons of chemical weapons are present. Such unexploded ordnance (UXO) constitutes a direct risk of detonation with increased human access (fisheries, water sports, cable constructions, wind farms and pipelines). Moreover, after more than 70 years of resting on the seabed, the metal shells of these munitions items corrode, such that chemicals leak out and distribute in the marine environment. Explosive chemicals such as TNT and its derivatives are known for their toxicity and carcinogenicity. In order not to endanger today's shipping traffic or the installation of pipelines and offshore plants by uncontrolled explosions, controlled blast-in-place (BiP) operations of these dangerous relics is a common practice worldwide. However, blast-in-place methods of in situ munitions disposal often result in incomplete (low-order) detonation, leaving substantial quantities of the explosive material in the environment. In the present free field investigation, we placed mussels (Mytilusspp.) as a biomonitoring system in an area of the Baltic Sea where BiP operations took place and where, by visual inspections by scientific divers, smaller and larger pieces of munitions-related materials were scattered on the seafloor. After recovery, the mussels were transferred to our laboratory and analyzed for TNT and its derivatives via gas chromatography and mass spectroscopy. Our data unequivocally demonstrate that low-order BiP operations of dumped munitions in the sea lead to multiple increases in the concentration of TNT and its metabolites in the mussels when compared to similar studies at corroding but still encased mines. For this reason, we explicitly criticize BiP operations because of the resulting environmental hazards, which can ultimately even endanger human seafood consumers.",,,,,,,,,24,0,0,0,14,0,24,,,0340-5761,1432-0738,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Med Sch Schleswig Holstein, Inst Toxicol & Pharmacol Nat Scientists, Campus Kiel,Brunswiker Str 10, D-24105 Kiel, Germany",,,,2020-07-01,WOS:000541090500006,32303806,

More specifically, tidal energy resources are unique in that they have the potential to produce relatively smoother power profiles over time through aggregation. In order to generate smooth power profiles from tidal resources, sufficient complexity within the timing of tides is necessary within electrical proximity. This study evaluates the concept of aggregating diverse tides for the purpose of reducing periods of no and low energy production and creating smoother power profiles in regions around Alaska and Washington by calculating cross-correlations of tidal current velocity time series.

All such developments interact with the seabed to some degree and so a key need exists for suitable methodology to monitor the impacts of large-scale Marine Renewable Energy Installations (MREIs). Many of these will be situated on mixed or rocky substrata, where conventional methods to characterise the habitat are unsuitable. Traditional destructive sampling is also inappropriate in conservation terms, particularly as safety zones around (MREIs) could function as Marine Protected Areas, with positive benefits for biodiversity. Here we describe a technique developed to effectively monitor the impact of MREIs and report the results of its field testing, enabling large areas to be surveyed accurately and cost-effectively. The methodology is based on a high-definition video camera, plus LED lights and laser scale markers, mounted on a flying array that maintains itself above the seabed grounded by a length of chain, thus causing minimal damage. Samples are taken by slow-speed tows of the gear behind a boat (200 m transects). The HD video and randomly selected frame grabs are analysed to quantify species distribution. The equipment was tested over two years in Lyme Bay, UK (25 m depth), then subsequently successfully deployed in demanding conditions at the deep (>50 m) high-energy Wave Hub site off Cornwall, UK, and a potential tidal stream energy site in Guernsey, Channel Islands (1.5 ms(-1) current), the first time remote samples from such a habitat have been achieved. The next stage in the monitoring development process is described, involving the use of Remote Operated Vehicles to survey the seabed post-deployment of MREI devices.

This challenge is highlighted by the worldwide expansion of marine renewable energy developments (MREDs) in areas already subject to multiple activities and climate change. Cumulative effects assessments in theory provide decision makers with adequate information about how the environment will respond to the incremental effects of licensed activities and are a legal requirement in many nations. In practise, however, such assessments are beset by uncertainties resulting in substantial delays during the licensing process that reduce MRED investor confidence and limit progress towards meeting climate change targets. In light of these targets and ambitions to manage the marine environment sustainably, reducing the uncertainty surrounding MRED effects and cumulative effects assessment are timely and vital. This review investigates the origins and evolution of cumulative effects assessment to identify why the multitude of approaches and pertinent research have emerged, and discusses key considerations and challenges relevant to assessing the cumulative effects of MREDs and other activities on ecosystems. The review recommends a shift away from the current reliance on disparate environmental impact assessments and limited strategic environmental assessments, and a move towards establishing a common system of coordinated data and research relative to ecologically meaningful areas, focussed on the needs of decision makers tasked with protecting and conserving marine ecosystems and services.

None of these groups were abundant in surface oil slick samples, and Colwellia was much more abundant in oil- degrading enrichment cultures incubated at 4 degrees C than at room temperature, suggesting that the colder temperatures at plume depth favored the development of these communities. These groups decreased in abundance after the well was capped in July, but the addition of hydrocarbons in laboratory incubations of deep waters from the Gulf of Mexico stimulated Colwellia's growth. Colwellia was the primary organism that incorporated C-13 from ethane and propane in stable isotope probing experiments, and given its abundance in environmental samples at the time that ethane and propane oxidation rates were high, it is likely that Colwellia was active in ethane and propane oxidation in situ. Colwellia also incorporated C-13 benzene, and Colwellia's abundance in crude oil enrichments without natural gas suggests that it has the ability to consume a wide range of hydrocarbon compounds or their degradation products. However, the fact that ethane and propane alone were capable of stimulating the growth of Colwellia, and to a lesser extent, Oceanospirillales, suggests that high natural gas content of this spill may have provided an advantage to these organisms.",,,,,,,,,271,0,0,0,226,0,300,,,0027-8424,1091-6490,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Dept Earth Sci, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USAUniv Calif Santa Barbara, Inst Marine Sci, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA",,,,2012-12-11,WOS:000312605600038,21969552,

The study will focus on two biological groups of interest for biofouling research: (i) the sun coral (Tubastraea spp.), which is a non-hermatypic exotic coral genus found in large abundances on oil platforms and other structures in south- and northeast Brazil; and (ii), barnacles, which are common and persistent fouling organisms on boats and marine platforms. Field trials will be conducted to assess the influence of varying ultrasound levels on fouling organisms, by using test plates as substrates. The operating frequency, sound pressure, average power applied and modeled distance from the ultrasound source to the test surface will be investigated. These evaluations will be conducted by mapping the acoustic field to evaluate the impact on substrate colonization, which will be assessed by image analysis tools. In field experiments, ultrasonic waves will be produced by customized battery powered ultrasound equipments. In addition, laboratory experiments will evaluate the effect of ultrasound, including acoustic cavitation, on larval settlement and survival. The acoustic pressure distribution within the experimental tank will be measured by a calibrated hydrophone. The acoustic pressure in the control volume will be monitored by using customized hydrophones that will be developed and fabricated. With preliminary experiments carried out at the IOUSP laboratory in Ubatuba, it was possible to set a basic experimental setup, with a control volume of approximately 50 mL. In the larval settlement and survival experiments, periodic images will be acquired with a digital camera. To evaluate the influence of ultrasonic irradiation on larvae settlement, high-frequency images will be obtained with two cameras orthogonally positioned to each other to provide tridimensional coordinates of larval swimming trajectories in the presence and absence of ultrasound. The larvae will be collected from spawning adult populations kept in the laboratory for the duration of the experiments. (AU)",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,14/23981-0,,,,,,,,"Escola Politécnica (EP).

We expected that if aerial insects actively resist overwater drift, then (1) radar-observed clear-air echoes should accumulate along the coastline when winds blow offshore, but they should be advected inland rapidly when winds blow onshore; and (2) accumulations of aerial plankton should be greatest along stretches of coastline most nearly perpendicular to the ambient wind flow. We tested these predictions by comparing the distribution of clear-air radar reflectivity at different sites and under different regimes of wind during the Convection and Precipitation/Electrification (CaPE) Experiment, which was conducted on the east coast of Florida in the summer of 1991. Elevated levels of clear-air reflectivity were evident along the coast on mornings when winds were from the west, but not on mornings with easterly winds. On days with westerly winds, this coastal enhancement occurred only in the morning, prior to the onset of the sea breeze. Following sea breeze development, coastal concentrations of clear-air echoes were advected westward and they dispersed rapidly; levels of clear-air reflectivity became depressed overall throughout the study area in the afternoon compared to the morning. Clear-air reflectivity was higher along a north-facing coastline compared to a south-facing coastline when winds had a northward component, with a mirror-image reversal of this pattern on days with southward winds. In contrast, clear-air echoes were uniformly nearly absent from the airspace over the adjacent ocean at all times of the day on all days. These findings support the hypothesis that the organisms comprising the aerial plankton respond behaviourally to coastlines to avoid being blown out to sea. Persistent concentrations of aerial plankton along coastlines may have important consequences for insect population dynamics and local ecosystem structure in coastal regions.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,0143-1161,,,,,,,,,,,"Center for Coastal, Energy, and Environmental Reources, Louisiana State University, E313 Howe-Russell Geoscience Complex, Baton Rouge, LA, 70803, USA",,,,2001-07-20,BCI:BCI200100410727,,

Cultures were exposed to Macondo surrogate oil using the water accommodated fraction (WAF), and dispersed oil using a chemically enhanced WAF (CEWAF) and diluted CEWAF, to replicate conditions following the Deepwater Horizon spill in the Gulf of Mexico. A range of responses were observed, that could broadly class the algae as either robust or sensitive to oil and/or dispersant exposure. Robust algae were identified as Synechococcus elongatus, Dunaliella tertiolecta, two pennate diatoms Phaeodactylum tricornutum and Navicula sp., and Skeletonema grethae CCMP775, and were largely unaffected by any of the treatments (no changes to growth rate or time spent in lag phase relative to controls). The rest of the phytoplankton, all centric diatoms, exhibited at least some combination of reduced growth rates or increased lag time in response to oil and/or dispersant exposure. Photophysiology did not have a strong treatment effect, with significant inhibition of photosynthetic efficiency (F-v/F-m) only observed in the CEWAF, if at all.

The direct contribution of observed sea ice variability to precipitation has not yet been investigated. The sensitivity of Antarctic precipitation to a range of sea ice concentrations is investigated using the Community Climate Model version 3 (CCM3) general circulation model. Sea ice concentrations derived from passive-microwave satellite imagery from 1979 to 1991 are used as surface boundary conditions for climate simulations in a model that resolves both ice-covered and ice-free fractions of each grid cell. Simulations are performed with climatological average ice concentrations, maximum and minimum concentrations, and an ensemble of simulations with interannually varying concentrations from 1979 to 1991. The minimum-ice run produces greater precipitation and onshore winds along the Antarctic coastal topography, except for the western Antarctic, where offshore winds reduce precipitation. The interannually varying model runs exhibit a seasonal response consistent with this picture, as greater precipitation is associated with reduced ice concentrations. The satellite-derived ice concentrations used here ( and the model simulations) exhibit significant differences between the periods of coverage from the two satellite instruments with different spatial resolutions and other characteristics. The results suggest that variability in sea ice concentrations does contribute to variability in Antarctic precipitation; however, the modeled precipitation has a greater response to the instrument-related differences than to the estimated ice variability.",,,,,,,,,15,0,0,0,1,0,17,,,0894-8755,1520-0442,,,,,,,,,,"USA, Cold Reg Res & Engn Lab, Hanover, NH 03755 USA",,,,2004-08-01,WOS:000223374000012,,

The mooring locations are under the influence of the incoming Atlantic Surface Water (ASW), at the northern and productive edge of the Western Alboran Gyre (WAG), and of the wind-induced upwelling offshore the Spanish coast. Additionally, a total of five core tops located in the same area were studied. The results are compared to information based on SeaWIFS images of chlorophyll-a concentration, SST, meteorological data on wind direction and intensity, and fluvial discharges from the main rivers of the Alboran Basin.The temporal oceanographic evolution of the Alboran Sea during the studied period was divided into five episodes: E1 (July 1997), E2 (August-October 1997), E3 (November to mid-December, 1997), E4 (December March 1998) and E5 (April-May 1998). The episodes represent different oceanographic conditions in the Alboran Sea during the studied period. Detailed analyses of the recorded pattern of bulk components, calcareous nannoplankton, planktonic foraminifera, diatoms and phytoliths reflect seasonal changes in the main hydrographic regimes in the western Alboran Sea. All biogenic bulk components, as well as the annual evolution of the floral and faunal assemblages follow a tri-modal pattern, with maximum fluxes recorded during E1, E3 and E5, representing periods of higher productivity and wind-induced upwelling. During these periods, species such as the Small Gephyrocapsa Group, Gephyrocapsa muellerae and Calcidiscus leptoporus, the foraminifer Globigerina bulloides and the diatom Chaetoceros resting spores (RS) were dominant. Gephirocapsa oceanica and Globorotalia inflata were coupled to the evolution of the Atlantic Surface Water (ASW) or related to surface water stability (E2 and E4). The diatom Leptocylindrus danicus responded to upwelling relaxation, and water stratification (E1, E2 and E4) and benthic diatoms were related to eddy intensity at bottom. Phytolith fluxes were directly related to wind intensities and the prevailing westerly winds (E3 and E5). The distribution of microfossils in surface sediments differs from the biogenic assemblages recorded in the sediment traps. In this sense, during 1997-1998 the strongest El Nino Event in the last century took place, which could have forced an unusual seasonality in the Alboran Sea, reflecting an exceptional micropaleontological signal not observed in the surface sediments.

In the last 20 years, there have been increasing concerns regarding the environmental impact of large increases in the amounts of PW released into the North Sea. We have previously shown that low levels of APs can induce disruption of the endocrine and reproductive systems of Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua). The aims of this follow-up study were to: (i) identify the lowest observable effect concentration of APs; (ii) study the effects of exposure to real PW, obtained from a North Sea oil-production platform; and (iii) study the biological mechanism of endocrine disruption in female cod. Fish were fed with feed paste containing several concentrations of four different APs (4-tert-butylphenol, 4-n-pentylphenol, 4-n-hexylphenol and 4-n-heptylphenol) or real PW for 20 weeks throughout the normal period of vitellogenesis in Atlantic cod from October to January. Male and female cod, exposed to AP and PW, were compared to unexposed fish and to fish fed paste containing 17 beta-oestradiol (E-2). Approximately 60% of the females and 96% of the males in the unexposed groups were mature at the end of the experiment. Our results show that exposure to APs and E-2 have different effects depending on the developmental stage of the fish. We observed that juvenile females are advanced into puberty and maturation, while gonad development was delayed in both maturing females and males. The AP-exposed groups contained increased numbers of mature females, and significant differences between the untreated group and the AP-treated groups were seen down to a dose of 4 mu g AP/kg body weight. In the high-dose AP and the E-2 exposed groups, all females matured and no juveniles were seen. These results suggest that AP-exposure can affect the timing of the onset of puberty in fish even at extremely low concentrations. Importantly, similar effects were not seen in the fish that were exposed to real PW. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

For this purpose, mature Wistar rats were fed 20% (w/w) lard or fish oil diets for 22 days, when the plasma membranes of the epididymal and perirenal adipocytes were prepared. Detailed analysis of the membrane lipids by chromatographic methods showed that dietary fat exerted a major effect on the lipid class and molecular species composition of the phospholipids. hs a result of fish oil feeding, significant increases in the 20:5(n - 3), 22:5(n - 3) and 22:6(n - 3) were detected in all glycerophospholipid classes, while the 18:1(n - 9) and 18:2(a - 6) and to a lesser extent 20:3(n - 6) decreased. Incorporation of n - 3 fatty acids increased the phosphatidylcholine/sphingomyelin ratio without changing the total phospholipid or free cholesterol content of the membrane. Fish oil feeding also caused a marked increase in the proportion of 24:1 in sphingomyelins, which occurred mainly at the expense of 18:0 and 24:0. New n - 3 fatty acid-containing species appeared in the choline and ethanolamine glycerophospholipids. when compared to membrane lipids from lard-fed rats. Membranes from fish oil fed rats also had moderately higher levels of ether lipids. Few differences were seen between the membranes of the epididymal and perirenal adipocytes. It is concluded that dietary fish oils modify the lipid structure of rat adipocyte plasma membranes by increasing the ratio of phosphatidylcholine to sphingomyelin and by increasing the proportion of molecular species with polyunsaturated fatty acids, which would be anticipated to increase the fluidity of the lipid bilayer of adipocyte plasma membranes.",,,,,,,,,16,0,0,0,8,0,20,,,0005-2736,,,,,,,,,,,"UNIV TORONTO,DEPT MED,TORONTO,ON,CANADAUNIV TORONTO,BANTING & BEST DEPT MED RES,TORONTO,ON,CANADA",,,,1997-01-31,WOS:A1997WH04800008,9042347,

A study using numerical wave modelling software has been undertaken to determine the modification to the wave field and thus the subsequent effects on sediment transport processes and shoreline evolution on the Mayo coast with the aim of optimising the arrangement of the marine energy park with respect to LCoE and environmental impacts. This methodology is a significant advancement in studies of the optimisation of wave farm arrangements. The methodology firstly consists of a capital expenditure model for pricing the farm infrastructure, secondly, a hydrodynamic analysis of the offshore wave conditions incident on the farm of devices is performed and the wave height incident on each device is passed as an input to the energy yield model, which is coupled with an operations and maintenance model. A financial calculator, which employs discounted cash-flow techniques, is employed to calculate the LCoE.

Our proprietary technology is based on functionalised graphene which capitalises on the tremendous mechanical strength inherent to graphene (and thus its ability to withstand harsh environments) to extract ionic charge from the sea. Devices such as those which will be developed here can be exploited in many applications, such as being attached to any sea vessel (buoys, boats, oil platforms, etc.) to charge battery packs or directly energise low power electronic devices. We are in a strong position to exploit major commercial outcomes of this feasibility study, due to links already made within Cambridge and in the broader UK community.Paragraf's 9 month £99,918 feasibility study will develop a new way of generating electricity from seawater by developing and exploiting the principal properties of graphene. It responds to the challenge to explore the potential of bringing a completely transformative marine renewable technology to market.No other companies or research groups are attempting to produce functionalized graphene with an electrical charge. Paragraf will significantly improve on current state of the art by using its proprietary technique to functionalize graphene with extra carriers without impacting on its electrical conductivity, to enable accelerated desorption and absorption of electrons from the ionic fluid, thus improving on previous experiments and offering the potential of real-world applications for this technology. By using its proprietary functionalised graphene, Paragraf will be able to generate much-increased voltages from ordinary saltwater, unlike previous experiments, enabling the company to do something that was impossible before and offering the potential of real world applications for this technology.Project outputs will be applicable in multiple global export markets for marine Internet of Things, and also have potential in other markets that ionic fluids are present, for example chemical manufacturing processes or effluent disposal. The project will also improve business growth for the marine renewables supply chain, as well as for UK nanotechnology materials and device production manufacturers.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,104502,,,,,,,,Paragraf Ltd,,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:15323631,,

In surface waters, Ba, Fe, Cu, Ni, Mn, and Co were relatively well correlated with salinity during all cruises, suggesting mixing with river water was the main influence on metal distributions in these waters. However, in deep oil/gas plumes (1000-1400 m depth), modestly elevated concentrations of Co and Ba were observed in late May, compared with postblowout conditions. Analysis of the oil itself along with leaching experiments confirm the oil as the source of the Co, whereas increased Ba was likely due to drilling mud used in the top kill attempt. Deep plume dissolved Mn largely reflected natural benthic input, though some samples showed slight elevation probably associated with the top kill. Dissolved Fe concentrations were low and also appeared largely topographically controlled and reflective of benthic input. Estimates suggest that microbial Fe demand may have affected the Fe distribution but probably not to the extent of Fe becoming a growth-limiting factor.

Offshore windfarms require construction procedures that minimise impacts on protected marine mammals. Uncertainty over the efficacy of existing guidelines for mitigating near-field injury when pile-driving recently resulted in the development of alternative measures, which integrated the routine deployment of acoustic deterrent devices (ADD) into engineering installation procedures without prior monitoring by Marine Mammal Observers. 2. We conducted research around the installation of jacket foundations at the UKs first deep-water offshore windfarm to address data gaps identified by regulators when consenting this new approach. Specifically, we aimed to a) measure the relationship between noise levels and hammer energy to inform assessments of near-field injury zones, b) assess the efficacy of ADDs to disperse harbour porpoises from these zones. 3. Distance from source had the biggest influence on received noise levels but, unexpectedly, received levels at any given distance were highest at low hammer energies. Modelling highlighted that this was because noise from pin pile installations was dominated by the strong negative relationship with pile penetration depth with only a weak positive relationship with hammer energy. 4. Acoustic detections of porpoises along a gradient of ADD exposure decreased in the 3-hours following a 15-minute ADD playback, with a 50% probability of response within 21.7 km. The minimum time to the first porpoise detection after playbacks was > 2 hours for sites within 1 km of the playback. 5. Our data suggest that the current regulatory focus on maximum hammer energies needs review, and future assessments of noise exposure should also consider foundation type. Despite higher piling noise levels than predicted, responses to ADD playback suggest mitigation was sufficiently conservative. Conversely, strong responses of porpoises to ADDs resulted in far-field disturbance beyond that required to mitigate injury. We recommend that risks to marine mammals can be further minimised by: 1) optimising ADD source signals and/or deployment schedules to minimise broad-scale disturbance; 2) minimising initial hammer energies when received noise levels were highest; 3) extending the initial phase of soft start with minimum hammer energies and low blow rates.Minhyuk Seo Piling noise andAcoustic Deterrent device signals weremeasured using calibrated broadband noise recorders (Soundtrap ST300HF,Ocean Instruments) moored2 mabove the seabed.

To quantify the distance at which pile driving sounds can be detected by harbor seals, unmasked hearing thresholds were obtained for series of five pile driving sounds recorded at 100 and 800 m from a pile driving location. The played back spectra resembled the spectra of sounds recorded under certain conditions 10-50 km from an offshore pile driving site. The lower the received level, the later within the series of sounds the harbor seals responded. The mean 50% detection threshold sound exposure levels for any sound in the series were: 40 (seal 01, 100 m), 39 (seal 01, 800 m), 43 (seal 02, 100 m), and 43 (seal 02, 800 m) dB re 1 mu Pa(2)s (add 9 dB for sound pressure level, dB re 1 mu Pa). The mean 50% detection thresholds based on detection of only the first sound of the series were ca. 5 dB higher. Detection at sea depends on the actual propagation conditions and on the degree of masking of the sounds by ambient noise, but the present study suggests that pile driving sounds are audible to harbor seals up to hundreds of kilometers from pile driving sites.

In every experiment, two biofilm-reactors were operated: one was treated with continuous nitrate flow (N reactor), and the other was a control reactor without nitrate (C reactor). A Polymerase Chain Reaction-Denaturing Gradient Gel Electrophoresis approach using the 16S rRNA gene was performed to compare the bacterial groups involved in biofilm formation in the N and C reactors. DGGE profiles showed remarkable changes in community structure only in experiments E2 and E3. Five bands extracted from the gel that represented the predominant bacterial groups were identified as , , sp., and sp. A reduction in the sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB) most probable number counts was observed only during the longer nitrate treatment (E3). Carbon steel coupons used for biofilm formation had a slightly higher weight loss in N reactors in all experiments.

The objective of this study is to determine the toxicity of Alaskan oil, as well as chemically dispersed oil. Oil experiments were performed using the water accommodated fraction of Alaskan oil (WAF) and the chemically enhanced water accommodated fraction of Alaskan oil (CEWAF). The Alaskan WAF is not cytotoxic to sperm whale skin cells though it did induce chromosome damage; S9-mediated metabolism did not affect the cytotoxicity of WAF but did increase the levels of chromosome damage. Alaskan CEWAF is more cytotoxic and genotoxic than the WAF; S9 mediated metabolism increased both cytotoxicity and genotoxicity of CEWAF. Analysis of the PAH content of Alaskan WAF and CEWAF revealed a forty-fold increase in the total levels of PAHs in CEWAF compared to WAF.

Also, we describe the fine structure of the opercular epithelium. The gill lamellar epithelium is thickened by the presence of large mitochondria-rich (MR) cells. These MR cells are further characterized by an extensive tubular system that is continuous with the basolateral plasma membrane and by a deep apical crypt often lined with microvilli. There are very few specialized MR accessory cells, which are associated with NaCl excretion in marine teleosts. Instead, MR cells are commonly isolated from each other laterally by flattened cells rich in intermediate filaments. These filament-rich (FR) cells are interconnected by desmosomes and have unusual canaliculi. These branchial FR cells are unique to P. schlosseri and may have a structural role. Electron-dense pavement cells rich in vesicles and large vacuous mitochondria compose the superficial layer of the epithelium. The unusual morphology of P. schlosseri's gill lamellae may be related to the animal's ability to effectively eliminate ammonia during air exposure. The inner opercular lining and parts of the leading edge of the filament have intraepithelial capillaries, which provide a more suitable gas exchange surface than the thickened lamellae with its restricted interlamellar water spaces. The arrangement of respiratory and ion exchange epithelia is opposite to that found in all other fish in which the lamellae typically function in gas exchange and the gill filament in ion regulation.",,,,,,,,,45,1,0,0,31,0,49,,,0302-766X,1432-0878,,,,,,,,,,"Univ British Columbia, Dept Zool, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z4, CanadaUniv British Columbia, Dept Anat, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z3, CanadaNatl Univ Singapore, Dept Sci Biol, Singapore 117548, SingaporeCity Univ Hong Kong, Dept Biol & Chem, Hong Kong, SAR, Peoples R China",,,,1999-11-01,WOS:000083493100016,10571123,

Furthermore, the first floating offshore wind farm is being built off the coast of Scotland. In order to realise the potential of MRE to achieve the targets set by the Government and keep the UK's leading position; the sector needs to address some relevant technical, environmental and interdisciplinary challenges. A coordinated response from different actors at national and regional level is required in order to successfully face these challenges. In an attempt to provide this coordination and with an initial focus on the South west of the UK, the Partnership for Research In Marine Renewable Energy (PRIMaRE) was established, bringing together research expertise and access to facilities for MRE developments.PRIMaRE comprises the Universities of Plymouth, Exeter, Southampton, Bristol and Bath, along with the Marine Biological Association and Plymouth Marine Laboratory. Completing the line-up of PRIMaRE is the South West Marine Energy Park and the Wave Hub facilities, acting as conduits between the research community and industry. More recently, PRIMaRE has extended its borders both nationally and internationally by including the Universities of Uppsala, Cardiff and Cranfield as associated partners of PRIMaRE. The core partner institutions have signed up to a partnership agreement to work together on research across the spectrum of MRE and to establish a 'network of excellence' centred in the South of the UK. PRIMaRE has established the annual conference (now in its third year) to showcase the research and provide a forum for discussion with MRE industry and academia, and have organised industry oriented workshops to identify research priorities in order to align research efforts with the requirements of the MRE sector.With the support of the EPSRC Network Grant, PRIMaRE aims to expand the partnership to a new level, making active and effective contributions to the challenges of the MRE sector. The Network brings together academic effort on MRE challenges, but also given the nascent state of the industry, aims to work closely with supply chain and industry partners, by providing training and a forum for sharing and exchange of ideas and through access to academic expertise and facilities. Unlike the academic focus of doctoral training schemes, the proposed network aspires to a broad sector approach, in which training and research collaborations are promoted both for conventional research and academic staff (i.e., post-docs, researchers, academics, PhD students) and for industry staff (developers, supply chain, test centres, regional government agencies). The proposed network has four main pillars of focus: (i) the annual PRIMaRE conference, expanded to become a key National and International event for the sector; (ii) the Key Challenge Workshops, an industry oriented dynamic and proactive forum to ensure alignment of PRIMaRE research priorities, and to focus on key emerging challenges requiring special attention; (iii) travel grants, which are crucial to ensure knowledge transfer and to promote the required mobility between academia and industry needed to develop new research collaborations nationally and internationally; and (iv) the PRIMaRE summer school, a continuing professional development (CPD) high level programme, providing the mechanism for exchange of knowledge between the research, academia, the novel MRE industry and wider sector.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,EP/P026109/1,,,,,,,,University of Plymouth,,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:15350814,,

During the in situ tests, we consistently found higher sediment strength (expressed in deceleration as well as in estimated quasi-static bearing capacity) in the carbonate sand (carbonate: 68-210 g; quartz: 25-85 g), which also showed a greater compressibility. Values were additionally affected by seafloor inclination (e.g., along a subaqueous dune or a channel), or layering in areas of sediment mobilization (by tides, shorebreak or currents). The study shows that the differences in in situ measured penetration profiles between carbonate sands and quartz sands are supported by the laboratory results and provide crucial information on mobile layers overlying sands of various physical properties.",,,,,,,,,37,2,0,0,1,0,39,,,0960-3182,1573-1529,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Bremen, MARUM, Leobener Str, D-28359 Bremen, GermanyUniv Hawaii, Hawaii Inst Geophys & Planetol, 1680 East W Rd, Honolulu, HI 96822 USAUniv Copenhagen, Dept Geog & Geol, Copenhagen, DenmarkBundesamt Seeschifffahrt & Hydrographie, Bernhard Nocht Str 78, D-20359 Hamburg, GermanyCtr Brest, IFREMER, F-29280 Plouzane, France",Bundesamt Seeschifffahrt & Hydrographie,,,2012-02-01,WOS:000210998900001,,

There are several possible risks posed to seabirds from marine renewable energy installations (MREIs) and many knowledge gaps still exist around the extent to which seabird habitats can overlap with MREIs. In this study, underlying seasonal and interannual variation in seabird distributions was investigated using kernel density estimation (KDE) to identify areas of core habitat use. This allowed the potential interactions between seabirds and a wave energy converter (WEC) to be assessed. The distributions of four seabird species were compared between seasons, years, and in the presence and absence of WECs. Although substantial interannual variation existed in baseline years prior to WEC deployment, the KDEs for all four species analysed were closer to the mooring points in the presence of a WEC in at least one season. The KDEs for all four species also increased in area in at least one season in the presence of a WEC. The KDEs of the northern fulmar and great skua overlapped the mooring points during spring in the presence of a device. The density of observations close to the mooring points increased for great skua, northern gannet, and northern fulmar during summer in the presence of a device. These results suggest that none of the four species analysed have shown avoidance or an extreme change in distribution as a result of the presence of a WEC. The continued monitoring of seabirds during WEC deployments is necessary to provide further data on how distributions may change in response to the presence of WECs. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

However, by the time that the first census estimated a population of 4100 individuals in 1939/40, the species had already lost most of its habitat. A state-run conservation program in the former German Democratic Republic, gradually implemented after 1973, focused on two key aspects that are still valid today: 1. The rescue of clutches threatened by agricultural activities and the raising and release of the young bustards. The release of 949 such individuals (from 1973 to 2014) has prevented the species' extinction in Germany, even though habitat conditions have continued to deteriorate. 2. The establishment of protected areas with management guidelines for optimizing Great Bustard habitats. Around 1979, there were still about 1,000 individuals in 40 breeding communities spread over an area of 400,000 ha. By 1979, 25 sanctuaries had been established, including breeding centres, putting an area of 76,376 ha under legal protection. As main causes for the population decline, research has identified a high incidence of clutch and chick losses due to agricultural activities and losses of chicks through starvation due to a low arthropod density (because of large-scale monocultures and intensive use of biocides). The conservation guidelines have aimed to increase plant and animal species diversity through the establishment of permanent grasslands and restricting application of fertilizers as well as by leaving strips of fallow land on arable fields. Guidelines for timing farming activities so as to adapt to the life cycle of the Great Bustard have decreased losses of clutches and chicks. However, economic constraints and the programme's limited personnel and financial resources have led to conservation efforts being concentrated on the three localities, Havellandisches Luch, Belziger Landschaftswiesen and Fiener Bruch. In 1996/97, 56 individuals were still to be found there. Within these three areas, 20,000 ha are currently defined as a Special Protected Area (EU-SPA), and 10,114 ha are protected as nature reserve. These make up respectively 42% and 21 % of the key habitat. In spring 2015, the population was estimated at 197 individuals. Since 1991 the conservation programme has been financed mainly by the Environment Ministries of Brandenburg and Saxony-Anhalt, supported by the Great Bustard Association and its sponsors. Still attention is focused on the generation of a species-rich ground vegetation, as a precondition for a high arthropod density, and on long intervals between farming activities. Organic farming within the protected areas has a positive effect on ecological conditions, but, unfortunately, is poorly funded by the government compared to growing maize. Parcels of fallow land with naturally developing vegetation and sown flower strips are used to provide both a good food supply and refuges from disturbance. Long-term monitoring of the efficiency of the land management demonstrates that the conservation of the Great Bustard supports a complex increase of plant and animal biodiversity. Support programmes of the European Union compensate farmers for loss of income. Since 1990 clutch and chick losses have risen dramatically owing to a massive population growth of Red Fox, Raccoon Dog, and Raccoon. The reduction of predator density has been a precondition for the survival of the Great Bustard for the last 20 years. This is achieved in close cooperation with local hunters. Other predators are corvids, which cause a high number of clutch losses in spring, and the resident sea eagles, which prey on both immature and adult birds. A current focus of the conservation project is the analysis of home range use with the help of individual-specific markings, including radio transmitters. A solid data base is crucial in conflicts over the continuing degradation of the Great Bustard's habitat (e.g. due to road construction, wind farms, and the increase of maize cultivation).",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,0941-0627,,,,,,,,,,,"Dorfstr 14, Nennhausen, D-14715, Germany",,,,2016-03-03,ZOOREC:ZOOR15203020062,,

This study used the climatic outputs of an atmosphere-ocean general circulation model to force a circumpolar ocean model that resolves ice shelf cavity circulation to investigate the response of Antarctic ice shelf melting to different climatic conditions (i.e., to a doubling of CO2 and to the Last Glacial Maximum conditions). Sensitivity experiments were also conducted to investigate the roles of both surface atmospheric change and changes of oceanic lateral boundary conditions. It was found that the rate of change of basal melt due to climate warming is much greater (by an order of magnitude) than that due to cooling. This is mainly because the intrusion of warm water onto the continental shelves, linked to sea ice production and climate change, is crucial in determining the basal melt rate of many ice shelves. Sensitivity experiments showed that changes of atmospheric heat flux and ocean temperature are both important for warm and cold climates. The offshore wind change, together with atmospheric heat flux change, strongly affected the production of both sea ice and high-density water, preventing warmer water approaching the ice shelves under a colder climate. These results reflect the importance of both water mass formation in the Antarctic shelf seas and subsurface ocean temperature in understanding the long-term response to climate change of the melting of Antarctic ice shelves.",,,,,,,,,17,0,0,0,3,0,18,,,0894-8755,1520-0442,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Tokyo, Atmosphere & Ocean Res Inst, Kashiwa, Chiba, JapanJapan Agcy Marine Earth Sci & Technol, Yokohama, Kanagawa, JapanUniv Tasmania, Antarctic Climate & Ecosyst Cooperat Res Ctr, Hobart, Tas, Australia",,,,2017-05-01,WOS:000399680600001,,

In shallow waters, ebullition is often a dominant emission pathway of methane. Current knowledge on the processes controlling gas bubble formation and persistence in aquatic sediments is limited. An important prerequisite for accurate quantification of the structure and methane bubbles in sediment samples is to preserve the ambient in situ conditions during the withdrawal process and further analysis. A novel freeze corer has been developed that facilitates sampling of gas-bearing soft sediments for X-ray computer tomography. The sampler allows freezing sediment inside a double-walled corer with a mixture of dry ice and ethanol. This corer has moderate costs and offers important advantages for gassy sediment sampling. Its simplicity and robustness allow to perform sampling from a small boat and the ability to characterize in situ sediment features. The applicability of this freeze coring technique for gas bubble quantification was validated during laboratory experiments aimed to investigate the effects of freezing on sediment gas content, bubble size distribution, and their geometry by comparing computer tomography scans of unfrozen vs. frozen cores. The performance of the corer was further evaluated during field conditions in Lake Kinneret (the Sea of Galilee, Israel). The results demonstrate the suitability of the freeze-coring method for in situ preservation of gas-bearing sediments.

In the winter months, nearshore sea surface temperature is influenced by both offshore sea surface temperatures and air temperature, both of which reflect solar input. During the summer months, the ocean is stratified. Consequently, winds influence nearshore sea surface temperatures by inducing upwelling and downwelling phenomena, resulting in decreases and increases in nearshore SSTs respectively. The spring and fall seasons exhibit trends from both the summer and the winter, but these trends are weaker.

Simultaneous exposure to high temperature and high pCO(2) reduced shell strength, decreased outer shell density and increased total lipid content. Despite identical diets, scallops exposed to high pCO(2) had higher content of saturated fatty acids, and lower content of polyunsaturated fatty acids suggesting reorganization of fatty acid chains to sustain basic metabolic functions under high pCO(2). Metagenomic sequencing of prokaryotes in scallop tissue revealed treatment differences in community composition between treatments and in the presence of genes associated with microbial cell regulation, signaling, and pigmentation.

In Japanese, ao means blue and shio means tide. The color of the sea surface changes to milky-blue and lots of shells and fish are killed when the Aoshio water covers them. This phenomenon has appeared only in a particular eutrophic coastal area of Tokyo Bay in Japan in summer time. The Aoshio phenomenon has been explained as follows: The origin is believed to be an anoxic bottom water mass in the offshore area, which develops in summer time and contains much H2S. This water mass arises in the coastal area when an offshore-ward wind blows several days in a row. When the anoxic water mass meets oxygen under the sea, the dissolved H2S turns into colloidal sulfur particles.

Since the performance of the GEV parameter estimation methods is dependent on both the method and the available sample size, the exploration of these issues is analytically performed. Firstly, a simulation study is implemented based on the Maximum Likelihood (ML), the L-moments (LMOM), the Elemental Percentile and the Maximum Product of Spacings methods for different sample sizes. It is concluded that the ML should not be taken for granted since LMOM method performs better in many respects. Afterwards, both methods are applied for the estimation of the GEV parameters of wind speed annual maxima series. LMOM method provided the best fits for the overwhelming majority of cases considered.

Deep-water coral communities are hotspots of diversity and biomass in the deep sea. Most deep-sea coral species are long-lived and slow-growing, and are thus expected to recover slowly after disturbance. A better understanding of the recovery potential of these organisms is necessary to make appropriate management decisions. 2. We used data from high resolution monitoring of individual coral colonies that were impacted by the Deepwater Horizon oil spill (April 2010) to parameterise and validate an annual, impact-dependent, state-structured matrix model to estimate the time to recovery for each coral colony. We projected the dynamics of three branch states: visibly healthy, unhealthy and hydroid-colonized. Although we implicitly included branch loss in the model, we focused on the short-term return of extant, damaged, branches to a visibly healthy state and did not consider the far longer-term re-growth of lost branches. 3. Our model estimates that, depending on the initial level of impact, corals impacted by the spill will take up to three decades to recover to a state where all remaining branches appear healthy, though the majority of corals are projected to reach that state within a decade. By that time, some of these colonies will have lost a significant number of branches, leading to approximately 10% reduction in total biomass at all impacted sites. 4. Overall, our model overestimates recovery, but branch loss estimates were reliable. Thus, the available growth rate data suggest that hundreds of years may be necessary for impacted communities to grow back to their initial biomass. 5. Policy implications. Our study quantifies the very slow recovery rate of deep-sea corals and demonstrates the imperative of prioritizing a precautionary approach for these deep-sea ecosystems over restoration after the fact. As anthropogenic pressure on the deep sea is likely to increase, we suggest the establishment of coral-monitoring sites implemented as part of Marine Protected Areas to limit and detect impact to deep-sea corals. Furthermore, estimates from our model may be used to plan short- and longer-term monitoring programmes after impact and to provide a timeline for policy.09-Feb-2018 R script for the modelModel_script.RTransition values for healthy branches (2011-2015)All values were estimated from digitized images of individual coral colonies.

The focus is on projects harvesting energy from winds, waves and currents. Environmental concerns induced by MRE projects are reported based on a classification scheme identifying stressors, receptors, effects and impacts. Although the potential effects of stressors on most receptors are identified, there are large knowledge gaps regarding the corresponding (positive and negative) impacts. In that context, the development of offshore MRE requires the implementation of fit-for-purpose monitoring activities aimed at environmental protection and knowledge development. Taking European legislation as an example, it is suggested to adopt standardized monitoring protocols for the enhanced usage and utility of environmental indicators. Towards this objective, the use of the FoR approach is advocated since it provides guidance for the definition and use of coherent set of environmental state indicators. After a description of this framework, various examples of applications are provided considering a virtual MRE project located in European waters. Finally, some conclusions and recommendations are provided for the successful implementation of the FoR approach and for future studies. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Underwater anthropogenic sound levels in the ocean are increasing, and the evidence for impacts of sound on marine life is overwhelming. Currently, regulatory bodies require emitted sound from marine renewable energy projects to be assessed in order to infer potential impacts on marine life. Geometric spreading models are sometimes used to assess likely ecological impacts of anthropogenic sound by estimating the propagation of underwater sound without in situ verification.2. This study investigated the propagation of anthropogenic sound in shallow waters (25-45 m deep) from a single monopole (a single loudspeaker) and twin monopole (two loudspeakers) sound sources replaying tidal turbine sound to approximate anthropogenic sound sources in this environment.3. Greater sound levels at 100-800, 801-2000 and 2001-20000Hz were observed at all observation distances from the sound source for the twin monopole compared to the single monopole. These results suggest that the sound from multiple anthropogenic sound sources installed in one location is likely to be cumulative in the environment where their sound fields overlap.4. Sound intensities observed in both the single monopole and twin monopole experiments for 01-20 kHz were higher than estimates derived from standard geometric spreading models for underwater sound by 3-41 dB across all measured distances from the source. The greatest difference from the theoretical spherical spreading model (41 dB) occurred at the site most distant from the twin monopole sound source, that is, 5 km.5. Synthesis and applications. The results show that geometric models used by some regulatory bodies may be underestimating the spatial extent to which the anthropogenic underwater sound may be propagating and creating potential ecological impacts. Based on field measurements, we have presented an alternative model which should assist regulatory agencies to better estimate and manage ecological impacts from anthropogenic underwater sound.",,,,,,,,,19,0,0,0,14,0,22,,,0021-8901,1365-2664,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Auckland, Inst Marine Sci, Auckland 1, New Zealand",,,,2014-02-12,WOS:000329846500004,,

This AT is caused by a layer of sub-surface gas, which prohibits the identification of geological structures below that gas layer. Sound speeds were measured directly in these sediments using the Acoustic Lance (AL) in both mid- and late-September 1999. In situ sound speeds obtained in mid-September varied between 1400 and 1550 m/s, and thus did not confirm the presence of gas within the top 3.5 m of the seafloor. However, signal waveforms suggested that a gassy layer might have been just below the depth penetrated by the Lance. In late-September, on the other hand, two sites showed an abrupt decrease in signal amplitudes and in sound speed (less than 800 m/s) at depths as shallow as 2 m below seafloor, indicating the presence of free gas bubbles. Piston-cored sediments were retrieved at the same sites in February 1999. X-radiographs of some of the cores revealed numerous microcracks caused by the expansion of gas bubbles during core retrieval. In contrast to in situ acoustic data, ultrasonic sound speeds acquired in the laboratory in May 1999 on those cores did not differentiate convincingly between gas-bearing and gas-free sediments.

Microbial mats flourish adjacent to the sabkha evaporites in tidal flats and pools of the Al Kharrar lagoon. Desiccation and decay of some microbial mats in tidal flat areas have led to precipitation of gypsum and halite there. The evaporite minerals have been precipitated through displacive, inclusive, and replacive growth within mud, sand, gravelly sand, and bioclastic sediment of the sabkha. Gypsum occurs as lenticular and tabular crystals whereas anhydrite occurs as nodular (individual, mosaic, and enterolithic) and pseudomorphs of lenticular gypsum crystals that grew displacively and replacively near the surface of the sabkha. Halite exists as a diagenetic cement within the sabkha sediment, or as primary rafts and skeletal crystals in desiccated tidal pools with salinity over 220aEuro degrees. Microbial mats are growing on the surface of the upper tidal flat areas and in pools at a salinity range of 80-110aEuro degrees, and they lead to biostabilization of the sediment. They have induced a range of sedimentary surface structures (MISS) including gas domes, reticulate patterns, tufts, pinnacles, wrinkles, and microbial shrinkage cracks. The occurrence, abundance, and association of evaporite minerals and MISS are controlled by local environmental factors such topography of the sabkha, emergence or submergence of tidal areas, surface area of the evaporite basin, contribution of meteoric water from floods from the adjoining Red Sea Mountains, and water salinity. These factors promote the growth of the microbial mats in the winter months, and deposition of evaporite minerals during summer months. Field and petrographic data indicate that the main recharge to the sabkha area is from tidal flow and water seepage from the Al-Kharrar lagoon. The results of this study indicate that within a small sabkha area of Al-Kharrar (3 x 17 km), a large variation in evaporite mineral types and morphologies grade into and are associated with MISS due to local environmental parameters. The interpretation of this association of evaporite minerals and MISS provides useful data for understanding the mechanisms responsible for precipitation of evaporite minerals and formation of MISS.",,,,,,,,,15,2,0,0,5,0,17,,,0172-9179,1612-4820,,,,,,,,,,"King Abdulaziz Univ, Fac Earth Sci, Dept Petr Geol & Sedimentol, Jeddah, Saudi ArabiaCairo Univ, Fac Sci, Dept Geol, Giza, Egypt",,,,2018-10-01,WOS:000438500500002,,

This event coincided with the spawning season of the Eastern oyster, Crassostrea virginica. Although oil bound to sediments constitutes an important source of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) exposure to benthic organisms, toxicity of sediment-associated DWH oil has not been investigated in any bivalve species. Here, we evaluated the sublethal effects of acute exposure of gametes, embryos and veliger larvae of the Eastern oyster to different concentrations of unfiltered elutriates of sediment contaminated with DWH oil. Our results suggest that gametes, embryos and veliger larvae are harmed by exposure to unfiltered elutriates of contaminated sediment. Effective concentrations for fertilization inhibition were 40.6 mu g tPAH50 L-1 and 173.2 mu g tPAH50 L-1 for EC20(1h) and EC50(1h) values, respectively. Embryo exposure resulted in dose-dependent abnormalities (EC20 and EC50 values were 77.7 mu g tPAH50 L-1 and 151 mu g tPAH50 L-1, respectively) and reduction in shell growth (EC20(24h) value of 1180 mu g tPAH50 L-1). Development and growth of veliger larvae were less sensitive to sediment-associated PAHs compared to embryos. Fertilization success and abnormality of larvae exposed as embryos were the most sensitive endpoints for assessing the toxicity of oil-contaminated sediment. Bulk of measured polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons were sediment-bound and caused toxic effects at lower tPAH50 concentrations than high energy water accommodated fractions (HEWAF) preparations from the same DWH oil. This study suggests risk assessments would benefit from further study of suspended contaminated sediment. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

However, their inherent fluctuations may have a negative impact on the power quality of a local electrical network. Grid operators assess this impact through the use of dynamic models of the generation units, which are inserted into the overall power system model. Providing these models is a compulsory step for any power generator to procure a grid connection above a specified power capacity. Significant issues were encountered in the wind energy industry regarding the dynamic modelling of devices, among which were model numerical instability, poor dynamic model quality and model incompatibility. Considering the large diversity of device types in the emerging ocean energy industry, these problems are considered as a major barrier to the larger scale grid-integration of marine energy converters. Dynamic models must clearly demonstrate the compliance of the actual power generation device and array of devices to the grid code requirements for grid-connection to be allowed. A further barrier to grid connection of ocean energy devices is that existing grid codes - mainly written in the context of wind energy - may be irrelevant or inadequate for ocean energy devices. This paper presents an overview of these issues, and details a radically different approach to the dynamic modelling of ocean energy devices that will assist in overcoming the issues previously encountered in the development of wind turbine models. It also highlights the gaps and inadequacy regarding grid code requirements for ocean energy devices, and provides some recommendations for a new ocean energy grid code.",,,,,"30th International Conference on Ocean, Offshore and Arctic Engineering30th International Conference on Ocean, Offshore and Arctic Engineering","JUN 19-24, 2011JUN 19-24, 2011","ASME, Ocean Offshore & Arctic Engn DivASME, Ocean Offshore & Arctic Engn Div","Rotterdam, NETHERLANDSRotterdam, NETHERLANDS",2,0,0,0,0,0,2,,,,,978-0-7918-4437-3,,,,,,,,,"Natl Univ Ireland Univ Coll Cork, Hydraul & Maritime Res Ctr, Cork, IrelandNatl Univ Ireland Univ Coll Cork, Dept Elect Engn, Cork, Ireland",,,,2011-01-01,WOS:000314736400086,,

Fouling constitutes the primary and most persistent source of failure. In addition to compromising turbine efficiency and reliability, fouling reduces sensor data quality - masking faults that will ultimately lead to failure. Unmitigated fouling triggers a form of biological succession known as flocculation that may eventually attract threatened species of tortoises and cetaceans to this rotating machinery.

One of the major spawning grounds of the brown sole in the Sea of Japan is located in the shelf region near the Sado Strait. The success or failure of the transport from the spawning ground to coastal nurseries during the pelagic life period could determine the year-class strength of the brown sole population. By applying an analytical transport model, it was revealed that there is a retention mechanism which prevents the eggs and larvae from drifting away from the nursery on the shelf by northeastward coastal current. Numerical simulation using a 3D Euler-Lagrangian model further revealed that upward movement of the eggs and larvae at the earlier phase of the transport process is indispensable for avoiding the wind-induced offshore drift at the spawning depth and for facilitating the entrainment of the eggs and larvae in the coastal eddies neighboring on the nursery under an average westerly wind (4 ms-1) during the spawning period. It is also evident from the simulation that strong westerly winds over a critical speed (ex. 5 ms-1) could reduce the larval retention on the shelf region, suggesting that year to year variation in the westerly could affect brown sole recruitment. A preliminary analysis on the wind time series, in fact, suggests that recent decline in the brown sole catch could be explained in part by the recruitment failure due to the increase in the frequency of a wind blow.",,,,,,,,,1,0,0,,0,0,1,,,0049-402X,,,,,,,,,,,"Ocean Research Institute, University of Tokyo, 1-15-1 Minamidai, Nakano, Tokyo, 164-8639, Japan",,,,1999-04-01,BCI:BCI200100051457,,

This paper investigates the sensitivity of upwelling processes, and of sea surface temperature (SST), in this region to resolution of the climate model and to the offshore wind structure. The Community Climate System Model (version 4) is used here, together with the Regional Ocean Modeling System. The main result is that a realistic wind stress curl at the eastern boundary, and a high-resolution ocean model, are required to well simulate the Benguela upwelling system. When the wind stress curl is too broad (as with a 1 degrees atmosphere model or coarser), a Sverdrup balance prevails at the eastern boundary, implying southward ocean transport extending as far as 30 degrees S and warm advection. Higher atmosphere resolution, up to 0.5 degrees, does bring the atmospheric jet closer to the coast, but there can be too strong a wind stress curl. The most realistic representation of the upwelling system is found by adjusting the 0.5 degrees atmosphere model wind structure near the coast toward observations, while using an eddy-resolving ocean model. A similar adjustment applied to a 1 degrees ocean model did not show such improvement. Finally, the remote equatorial Atlantic response to restoring SST in a broad region offshore of Benguela is substantial; however, there is not a large response to correcting SST in the narrow coastal upwelling zone alone.",,,,,,,,,101,0,0,0,13,0,106,,,0894-8755,1520-0442,,,,,,,,,,"Natl Ctr Atmospher Res, Climate & Global Dynam Div, Boulder, CO 80305 USARutgers State Univ, Dept Environm Sci, New Brunswick, NJ 08903 USAUniv Alaska Fairbanks, Inst Marine Sci, Fairbanks, AK USA",,,,2015-12-25,WOS:000365860500021,,

Additionally, evaluation of hydrocarbon degradation potential was assessed from fortnight laboratory experiments, With and without crude oil amendment. Silt + Clay and organic matter (OM) content influenced the retention of hydrocarbons around plant roots by increasing their levels. Those parameters tended to correlate positively with total microbial abundance but negatively with hydrocarbon degrading microorganisms, a fact that could be related to lower hydrocarbon bioavailability. Rhizosediment laboratory experiments without crude oil amendment showed a significant (p < 0.05) negative correlation between hydrocarbon degradation rates and OM and Silt + Clay content, confirming the strong influence of rhizosediment characteristics on hydrocarbons bioavailability.

A case study in Michoacan, Mexico",,,,,,,,JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION,,,,266,,,,,,121984,,,10.1016/j.jclepro.2020.121984,,,,,,,Article,SEP 1 2020,2020,"In many parts of the world, renewable energy is being considered as an alternative to supply electricity to communities in developing regions. However, even though various technologies are becoming available, there are several socio-environmental constraints that impinge on the viability of ocean energy conversion projects in isolated communities. By assessing environmental restrictions and socioeconomic attributes where electric power may be produced from the ocean can be useful in prioritizing the locations (especially those isolated) where this alternative is more viable. This paper examines socio-economic and environmental factors that may affect the introduction of ocean energy harvesting in areas currently without electricity. Our findings reveal that: a) in the coastal area of the state of Michoacan, southwest Mexico (at < 20 km from the coast and <100 m.a.s.l.), 153 human settlements with over 4,000 inhabitants lack electric power; 16 of these settlements are indigenous; b) economic activities are mostly fisheries and ecotourism; yet, marginalizaion is very high in the area; c) there are four protected areas with nesting sites for several marine turtle species (greater black, hawksbill, leatherback, and green); the Deep Pacific Sea natural protected area harbors great biodiversity; and d) electric power may be produced from ocean energy, especially waves, currents and thermal gradients. The infrastructure for grid connection and technical and logistical support is limited, and the topography near the coast is complex. However, our results indicate that the coastal region of Michoacan, has promising sources of ocean energy, especially for isolated settlements with limited, or no, electricity supply. The results show that waves and thermal gradients are viable options for energy generation in the area studied. Considering socioeconomic conditions and environmental restrictions, our observations suggest that, in particular, ocean energy projects might be successfully implemented in two locations on the coast of Michoacan, Future on-site studies into the environmental impact, the percepction and acceptance of society towards the new technologies and economic costs are necessary before implementing these new technologies.

Oil saturation on migration pathways remains relatively low, so typically fewer oil inclusions get trapped compared with samples from an oil column. Geochemical analysis of the much smaller amounts of inclusion oil present in samples from interpreted oil migration pathways has been attempted for two samples from the Charnpagny-1 and Delamere-1 wells in the Vulcan Sub-Basin, northern offshore Australia. A combination of petrographic analysis, bulk geochemical inclusion analysis and log evaluation confirmed that both samples were from oil migration pathways. Despite the small number of oil inclusions, reliable geochemical data were acquired from both samples that were significantly above the levels detected for the system and outside-rinse blanks. The FI oil trapped on the interpreted oil migration pathway in Champagny-1 was generated from clay-rich marine source rock with little terrigenous organic matter input. It was generated at peak oil window maturity and correlates best with oils derived from the Late Jurassic Lower Vulcan Formation. In contrast, the Delamere-1 FI oil contains evidence of greater input of terrigenous organic matter and was generated at early oil window maturity. This FI oil also contains a signature of a biodegraded component, which could have been generated either from the Middle Jurassic Plover Formation, or from an older source rock. These data indicate that it is feasible to geochemically map migration pathways across prospects or basins, and to analyse palaeo-oil compositions in oil zones where the few inclusions get trapped. This also suggests that the few oil inclusions that sometimes occur in Proterozoic or Archaean rocks may be analysable in the future, which would provide relatively pristine and robust data on the composition and diversity of Earth's early biosphere.

During another El Nino/Southern Oscillation transition period in 2006-2007 when the El Nino state retreated and the La Nina returned, a similar pattern in spawning habitat quality was seen. The coupling between the atmospheric forcing, the physical ocean states and the properties of the sardine egg spawning are investigated using dynamically consistent data-assimilation fits of the available physical oceanographic observations during these months. Fits were executed using the Regional Ocean Modeling System four-dimensional variational assimilation platform along with adjoint model runs using a passive tracer to deduce source waters for the areas of interest. Analysis using the data-assimilation model runs reveals that unusually strong equatorward wind-forcing drives offshore transport during the La Nina conditions, which extends the spawning habitat for sardine further offshore. A statistical model of sardine spawning habitat shows better habitat quality during the El Nino conditions, which is associated with higher egg densities and corresponded to higher daily egg production. Concentration of eggs is also increased by convergence of water. The results of the source waters analysis using the adjoint data assimilation model support the idea that offshore transport extends the spawning habitat, and show that higher levels of nutrient are brought into the spawning habitat with high concentration of sardine eggs.",,,,,,,,,35,1,0,0,16,1,40,,,2169-9275,2169-9291,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Dept Ocean Sci, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USAUniv Calif San Diego, Scripps Inst Oceanog, La Jolla, CA 92093 USANOAA, SW Fisheries Sci Ctr, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA",,,,2012-04-04,WOS:000301477200002,,

In Egypt there are many regions containing such expansive soils especially at the desert lands. The remote areas are used now for establishing many projects such as (wind farms, solar plants, irrigation projects and nuclear power plants). The use of a mixture of lime-treated swelling soil mixed with potable water to overcome the swelling potential of these soils is available in many countries especially in U.S.A. For the projects located adjacent to the coasts of Sea, the sea water is available instead of potable water. This paper presents an experimental and field case study on the lime-treated soil but mixed with sea water instead of potable water. The effect of using sea water instead of potable water on the swelling behavior, engineering properties, and the consolidation parameters were studied. On the other hand, this research deals with the behavior of the lime-treated soil in swelling state as well as in consolidation state. Tests results showed that there are significant reductions in the swelling potential, engineering properties, and the consolidation parameters in case of using sea water instead of potable water as mixing water. The environmental and economic impact gained from such process was put into consideration. (C) 2017 Faculty of Engineering, Alexandria University. Production and hosting by Elsevier B.V.

Hence, special attention should be given to evaluate the effect of cyclic load on the behavior of soil and structure. In this study, utilizing Cyclic Direct Simple Shear apparatus (CDSS), the long-term cyclic behavior of marine silty sand is investigated. Failure contours are proposed using the test results.

One of the major spawning grounds of the brown sole in the Sea of Japan is located in the shelf region near the Sado Strait. The success or failure of the transport from the spawning ground to coastal nurseries during the pelagic life period could determine the year-class strength of the brown sole population. By applying an analytical transport model, it was revealed that there is a retention mechanism which prevents the eggs and larvae from drifting away from the nursery on the shelf by northeastward coastal current. Numerical simulation using a 3D Euler-Lagrangian model further revealed that upward movement of the eggs and larvae at the earlier phase of the transport process is indispensable for avoiding the wind-induced offshore drift at the spawning depth and for facilitating the entrainment of the eggs and larvae in the coastal eddies neighboring on the nursery under an average westerly wind (4 ms-1) during the spawning period. It is also evident from the simulation that strong westerly winds over a critical speed (ex. 5 ms-1) could reduce the larval retention on the shelf region, suggesting that year to year variation in the westerly could affect brown sole recruitment. A preliminary analysis on the wind time series, in fact, suggests that recent decline in the brown sole catch could be explained in part by the recruitment failure due to the increase in the frequency of a wind blow.",,,,,,,,,4,0,0,0,1,0,4,,,0049-402X,,,,,,,,,,,"Ocean Research Institute, University of Tokyo, 1-15-1 Minamidai, Nakano, Tokyo, 164-8639, Japan",,,,1999-04-01,ZOOREC:ZOOR13700011696,,

Seismic signatures indicative of disseminated hydrates and free gas Include the bottom simulating reflector (BSR), gas chimney, and mud diapir associated with enhanced seismic reflections, acoustic blanking, masking, and chaotic appearance have been observed. The acoustic travel-time responses, density, and compensated neutron three porosity log analysis, high-precision grid tomography inversion analysis, and constrained sparse spike inversion confirm the presence of free gas below the gas-hydrate-bearing zone (GHBZ). Free-gas-bearing zones have significantly different p-wave impedances and low-velocity anomalies than the overlying GHBZ and surrounding strata. These anomalous zones are controlled by the structural attitude of the reservoir strata, which are characterized as inter-bedded stratigraphic units. Variations in the type and geological characteristics of the hydrocarbon migration pathways were observed between sites W18 and W19 on the western ridge and sites W11 and W17 on the eastern ridge in the GMGS study area. The efficiency of gas migration in the western ridge may be higher than that in the eastern ridge, resulting in variations in hydrate gas types, thickness of the GHBZ, and gas migration flux and accumulation. Except for site W11, hydrates were recovered below the structure I inferred BSR at sites W17, W18, and W19. The gas-hydrate stability zone calculations reveal that the structure I hydrate stability zone differs from the BSR depth and is generally shallower than the base of the logging anomaly, indicating the coexistence of structure I and II hydrates. The BSR is not indicative of the BGHSZ; it is rather regarded as a transitional indicator of structure I and II gas hydrates in the GHPTR. The appearance of free gas and hydrates below the structure I inferred BSR indicates that the Shenhu area is characterized by a complex hydrate formation and accumulation system resulting from the supply of biogenic and thermogenic gases. Despite fine-grained host sediments predominating the GHPTR, the coupling of favorable conditions including efficient hydrocarbon generation, sufficient gas supply, multiple pathways for gas migration, and relatively high reservoir porosity have led to the development of highly saturated gas-hydrate accumulations within relatively thick sedimentary sections, which demonstrates a significant resource potential.",,,,,,,,,94,15,0,0,3,0,104,,,0264-8172,1873-4073,,,,,,,,,,"Minist Nat Resources, Guangzhou Marine Geol Survey, MNR Key Lab Marine Mineral Resources, Guangzhou 510075, Peoples R ChinaSun Yat Sen Univ, Sch Marine Sci, Zhuhai 519000, Peoples R ChinaSouthern Marine Sci & Engn Guangdong Lab, Guangzhou 511458, Peoples R China",,,,2020-04-01,WOS:000514747800007,,

Since the last thorough review of the effects of anthropogenic noise on cetaceans in 1995, a substantial number of research reports has been published and our ability to document response(s), or the lack thereof, has improved. While rigorous measurement of responses remains important, there is an increased need to interpret observed actions in the context of population-level consequences and acceptable exposure levels. There has been little change in the sources of noise, with the notable addition of noise from wind farms and novel acoustic deterrent and harassment devices (ADDs/AHDs). Overall, the noise sources of primary concern are ships, seismic exploration, sonars of all types and some AHDs.2. Responses to noise fall into three main categories: behavioural, acoustic and physiological. We reviewed reports of the first two exhaustively, reviewing all peer-reviewed literature since 1995 with exceptions only for emerging subjects. Furthermore, we fully review only those studies for which received sound characteristics (amplitude and frequency) are reported, because interpreting what elicits responses or lack of responses is impossible without this exposure information. Behavioural responses include changes in surfacing, diving and heading patterns. Acoustic responses include changes in type or timing of vocalizations relative to the noise source. For physiological responses we address the issues of auditory threshold shifts and 'stress', albeit in a more limited capacity; a thorough review of physiological consequences is beyond the scope of this paper.3. Overall, we found significant progress in the documentation of responses of cetaceans to various noise sources. However, we are concerned about the lack of investigation into the potential effects of prevalent noise sources such as commercial sonars, depth finders and fisheries acoustics gear. Furthermore, we were surprised at the number of experiments that failed to report any information about the sound exposure experienced by their experimental subjects. Conducting experiments with cetaceans is challenging and opportunities are limited, so use of the latter should be maximized and include rigorous measurements and or modelling of exposure.",,,,,,,,,417,5,0,0,334,1,486,,,0305-1838,1365-2907,,,,,,,,,,"Florida State Univ, Dept Oceanog, Tallahassee, FL 32306 USADuke Univ, Marine Lab, Nicholas Sch Environm & Earth Sci, Beaufort, NC 28516 USAUniv Hawaii, Joint Inst Marine & Atmospher Res, Honolulu, HI 96822 USAWoods Hole Oceanog Inst, Dept Biol, Woods Hole, MA 02543 USA",,,,2007-04-01,WOS:000247227900001,,

Multi-disciplinary studies (2004 to 2015) were commissioned specifically to document the benthic habitat, and have resulted in the designation of this site as a Marine Protected Area (MPA) under the European Commission's Habitats Directive as an example of Submarine structures formed by leaking gases. However, this paper is focussed on the geoscience aspects of the site: the mineralogy and isotopic composition of the MDAC, its formation and age. It considers the implications of these findings with respect to the timing of the deglaciation of the area since the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM), and the environmental implications of the seepage of methane from the site over a period of at least 17,000 years. Carbon isotope ratios (delta C-13 - 34 to - 54 parts per thousand) confirm that the carbonate minerals (high-Mg calcite and aragonite) result from the anaerobic oxidation of methane. Widespread shallow gas within post-glacial sediments is sourced from underlying coal-bearing Carboniferous strata. Geophysical (side-scan sonar and multi-beam echo sounder) and visual surveys show that the MDAC occurs as isolated lumps, continuous pavements, and cliffs < 6 m tall, which post-date the post-glacial sediments, but are in places covered by a veneer of coarse mobile surficial sediments. U-Th dates (17,000 +/- 5500 to 4000 +/- 200 BP) suggest continual MDAC formation since the last glacial maximum, and constrain the postglacial sea level rise in this part of the Irish Sea; the site must have been submarine before MDAC formation started, whether or not methane was escaping. Visual and acoustic evidence of gas seepage is limited, but methane concentrations in the water are high (< 21.4 nmol l(-1)) and suggest present-day export to the atmosphere. It is also implied that significant methane release to the atmosphere occurred immediately after the retreat of the ice that covered the site during the LGM until 21.9 to 20.7 ka BP.",,,,,,,,,15,0,0,0,4,0,15,,,0276-0460,1432-1157,,,,,,,,,,"Alan Judd Partnership, High Mickley, Northd, EnglandJoint Nat Conservat Comm, Peterborough, EnglandCtr Environm Fisheries & Aquaculture Sci, Lowestoft, Suffolk, EnglandSouth Atlantic Environm Res Inst SAERI, Stanley, Falkland IslandNorges Geol Underskelse, Trondheim, NorwayBritish Geol Survey, Nottingham, England",Alan Judd PartnershipJoint Nat Conservat CommSouth Atlantic Environm Res Inst SAERINorges Geol Underskelse,,,2020-09-24,WOS:000551544300003,,

However, their stochastic and uncertain behavior negatively influences the power system stability. In this paper, a hybrid system composed of PMSG-based wind farm, marine-current farm, and PV has been used to supply the network's load. These resources have been connected to a nine-bus power system through a line commutated HVDC link. A new control method has been proposed to enhance the damping characteristics of power system. This method is based on Generalized Predictive Control (GPC) for design of inverter current regulator (ICR) of HVDC link. In this regard, the BAT search algorithm has been employed for obtaining the best solution for the GPC's objective function. In order to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed GPC-BAT method, the simulations using eigenvalue analysis and root-loci technique are presented. For further investigating the efficiency of conducted approach, a PID controller has been designed for controlling the ICR of HVDC link, and the results have been compared with those of GPC-BAT method. The comparisons have been made through a three-phase short circuit fault on the multi-machine power system in MATLAB software.

The X-ray structure of this salt was redetermined with improved resolution and corrected for librational motion: monoclinic, space group P21/c (No. 14), Z = 8, a = 14.986(2) A, b = 13.396(2) A, c = 16.351(2) A, beta = 108.12(1)°. The gas phase structures of E82+ and neutral E8 (E = S, Se) were examined by ab initio methods (B3PW91, MPW1PW91) leading to DeltafH⊖[S82+, g] = 2151 kJ/mol and DeltafH⊖[Se82+, g] = 2071 kJ/mol. The observed solid state structures of S82+ and Se82+ with the unusually long transannular bonds of 2.82.9 A were reproduced computationally for the first time, and the E82+ dications were shown to be unstable toward all stoichiometrically possible dissociation products En+ and/or E42+ [n = 27, exothermic by 21207 kJ/mol (E = S), 6151 kJ/mol (E = Se)]. Lattice potential energies of the hexafluoroarsenate salts of the latter cations were estimated showing that S8(AsF6)2 [Se8(AsF6)2] is lattice stabilized in the solid state relative to the corresponding AsF6- salts of the stoichiometrically possible dissociation products by at least 116 [204] kJ/mol. The fluoride ion affinity of AsF5(g) was calculated to be 430.5 5.5 kJ/mol [average B3PW91 and MPW1PW91 with the 6-311+G(3df) basis set]. The experimental and calculated FT-Raman spectra of E8(AsF6)2 are in good agreement and show the presence of a cross ring vibration with an experimental (calculated, scaled) stretching frequency of 282 (292) cm-1 for S82+ and 130 (133) cm-1 for Se82+. An atoms in molecules analysis (AIM) of E82+ (E = S, Se) gave eight bond critical points between ring atoms and a ninth transannular (E3E7) bond critical point, as well as three ring and one cage critical points. The cage bonding was supported by a natural bond orbital (NBO) analysis which showed, in addition to the E8 sigma-bonded framework, weak pi bonding around the ring as well as numerous other weak interactions, the strongest of which is the weak transannular E3E7 [2.86 A (S82+), 2.91 A (Se82+)] bond. The positive charge is delocalized over all atoms, decreasing the Coulombic repulsion between positively charged atoms relative to that in the less stable S8-like exoexo E82+ isomer. The overall geometry was accounted for by the WadeMingos rules, further supporting the case for cage bonding. The bonding in Te82+ is similar, but with a stronger transannular E3E7 (E = Te) bonding. The bonding in E82+ (E = S, Se, Te) can also be understood in terms of a sigma-bonded E8 framework with additional bonding and charge delocalization occurring by a combination of transannular npi*npi* (n = 3, 4, 5), and np2 nsigma* bonding. The classically bonded S82+ (Se82+) dication containing a short transannular S+S+ (Se+Se+) bond of 2.20 (2.57) A is 29 (6) kJ/mol higher in energy than the observed structure in which the positive charge is delocalized over all eight chalcogen atoms.

A full coupled modeling system (Semi-implicit Eulerian-Lagrangian Finite-Element model coupled with Wind Wave Model II, SELFE-WWM-II) for simulating the interaction of tide, surge and waves based on an unstructured grid is applied to simulate the storm tide and wind waves for the northeastern coast of Taiwan. The coupled model was driven by the astronomical tide and consisted of main eight tidal constituents and the meteorological forcings (air pressure and wind stress) of typhoons. SELFE computes the depth-averaged current and water surface elevation passed to WWM-II, while WWM-II passes the radiation stress to SELFE by solving the wave action equation. Hindcasts of wind waves and storm tides for five typhoon events were developed to validate the coupled model. The detailed comparisons generally show good agreement between the simulations and measurements. The contributions of surge induced by wave and meteorological forcings to the storm tide were investigated for Typhoon Soudelor (2015) at three tide gauge stations. The results reveal that the surge contributed by wave radiation stress was 0.55 m at Suao Port due to the giant offshore wind wave (exceeding 16.0 m) caused by Typhoon Soudelor (2015) and the steep sea-bottom slope. The air pressure resulted in a 0.6 m surge at Hualien Port because of an inverted barometer effect. The wind stress effect was only slightly significant at Keelung Port, contributing 0.22 m to the storm tide. We conclude that wind waves should not be neglected when modeling typhoon-induced storm tides, especially in regions with steep sea-bottom slopes. In addition, accurate tidal and meteorological forces are also required for storm tide modeling.",,,,,,,,,25,0,0,0,4,0,25,,,2073-4441,,,,,,,,,,,"Natl Sci & Technol Ctr Disaster Reduct, New Taipei 23143, TaiwanNatl Cheng Kung Univ, Dept Hydraul & Ocean Engn, Tainan 70101, Taiwan",,,,2017-07-01,WOS:000406681700100,,

With thousands of artificial structures present in the North Sea, we test the hypothesis that these structures are connected by water currents and act as an interconnected reef. Population genetic structure of the Blue mussel, Mytilus edulis was expected to follow a pattern predicted by particle tracking models (PTM). Correlation between population genetic differentiation, based on microsatellite markers, and particle exchange was tested. Specimens of M. edulis were found at each location, although the PTM indicated that locations >85 km offshore were isolated from coastal sub-populations. Fixation coefficient FST correlated with the number of arrivals in the PTM. However, the number of effective migrants per generation as inferred from coalescent simulations did not show a strong correlation with the arriving particles. Isolation by distance analysis showed no increase in isolation with increasing distance and we did not find clear structure among the populations. The marine stepping-stone effect is obviously important for the distribution of M. edulis in the North Sea and it may influence ecologically comparable species in a similar way. In the absence of artificial shallow hard substrates, M. edulis would be unlikely to survive in offshore North Sea waters. Although we found an indication that FST was lower between connected locations, isolation by distance analysis showed no increase in isolation with increasing distance. Finally, we did not find clear structure among the populations. Mytilus edulis population genetics Samples were collected at 27 locations (henceforth named sub-populations) between April 2014 and January 2016: from coastal sub-populations during low tide, by commercial and scientific divers from oil and gas platforms and wind farm foundations and during inspection, repair and maintenance work on buoys and offshore installations from structures lifted out of the water (Table 1, Figure 1). Sampling depth varied between 0 and 27 meters. Two likely outgroup sub-populations corresponding to peripheral populations of the species M. edulis (Denmark) and M. galloprovincialis (Portugal) were included; from a harbour in Lisbon, Portugal and from mussel longlines in the Limfjorden in Denmark. Geographic distances between sub-populations (excluding outgroups) varied from 17 km (Scheveningen and Q13-A) to 1,105 km (Blyth and Sylt) with an average of 348 km. Between 50 and approximately 100 individuals were sampled randomly at every location and stored at -20°C or in 70% ethanol to be transported to the laboratory. Then, all samples were cleaned of marine growth and placed at -80°C for long-term storage. Molecular methods From each sample, between 24 and 67 specimens were selected randomly and genomic DNA was isolated from the adductor muscles by using the 96 well genomic DNA extraction kit according to the manufacturers protocol (FAVORGEN Biotech Corp). DNA concentration was measured on a Nanodrop and diluted to 10 ng/mul. Two multiplex sets of four markers were used (set1: Med367, Med379, Med722 and Med733; set2: Med737, Med740, Med747 and Me15/16). Markers were used individually in the PCR, pooled per set and analysed on an ABI3730 DNA Analyser. Seven markers were microsatellite loci as described in Lallias et al. (2009) and the Me15/16 locus targeted a part of the adhesive protein gene which partially discriminates between M. edulis, M. galloprovincialis and M. trossulus (Inoue, Waite, Matsuoka, Odo, & Harayama, 1995). Marker information, PCR conditions and multiplex conditions are indicated in Table 2. The GeneScan 500 LIZ marker was used as internal marker. Allele calling was performed in Genemapper v3.7 (Applied Biosystems 2004). Connectivity calculated by particle tracking models The transport of mussel larvae between sampled sub-populations in the North Sea was modelled using two Delft3D software modules: FLOW and PART (Deltares, 2016b, 2016a). The PART module was able to simulate mid-field water quality and particle tracking, based on a hydrodynamic forcing output from the other Delft3D module, FLOW. Hydrodynamical model The hydrodynamical model applied was Delft3D-FLOW, which solves the unsteady shallow-water equations in three dimensions. The model incorporates a large number of processes, such as wind shear, wave forces, tidal forces, density-driven flows, stratification, atmospheric pressure changes, air temperature and the exposure and inundation of intertidal flats. The large number of processes included in this module means that Delft3D-FLOW can be applied to a wide range of environments (e.g. river, estuarine, coastal and marine areas; Lesser et al. 2004). Flow equations were solved on a curvilinear grid consisting of 8,710 computational elements (Roelvink, Jeuken, van Holland, Aarninkhof, & Stam, 2001). The vertical resolution of the model was ten water layers using a sigma-coordinated approach (i.e., proportional to water depth; Stelling and van Kester 1994). Hydrodynamic transport was computed using detailed bathymetry and open boundary forcing based on tidal constituents. The model was forced using meteorological data from the High Resolution Limited Area Model (KNMI, 2015), which comprised two horizontal wind velocity components (at 10 m above mean sea level) and other atmospheric variables such as air pressure and temperature, archived every 6 h. The freshwater discharges from 18 rivers were included in the model; seven of these discharges varied temporally (daily averages) and 11 were constant (based on long-term averages). This model is described in detail in Erftemeijer et al. (2009). Two grid lay-outs covering the southern North Sea (including the Wadden Sea) were used in this study: a moderately fine grid (ZUNOGROF) and a domain decomposition model grid (ZUNO-DD) with a much higher grid resolution in the Dutch coastal zone and the Wadden Sea. The subdomains of the ZUNO DD model are displayed in Figure 2 using different colours and are used to increase spatial resolution for hydrodynamic results in these areas. In coastal and inshore (estuarine, lagoonal) systems, the spatial variability in hydrodynamic forcing is much higher. To enable the simulation of these processes, the areas near the Dutch coast and in the Wadden Sea have been given a much higher horizontal grid density, so with smaller grid cells per surface unit. This provides for a much better simulation of the hydrodynamic processes in such areas. These spatial differences in resolution in the Dutch coastal waters and the Wadden Sea have been given a different colouring in Figure 2. Particle transport model Particle tracking models (PTM) are often used in environmental modelling (e.g., North et al. 2008; Broekhuizen et al. 2011; Postma et al. 2013). Here, the Delft3D-PART module was used to calculate larval transport across the southern North Sea. Delft3D-PART is a random walk particle tracking model, based on the principle that movement of dissolved substances in water can be described by a limited but potentially large number of discrete particles that are subject to advection due to currents and by horizontal and vertical dispersion. The movement of the particles in the model consists of two steps: advection, which is driven by the FLOW results, and dispersion, which is a stochastic random walk process. In addition, the horizontal and vertical movement of the particles can be adjusted to account for swimming preferences or changes in buoyancy. Particle tracking allows water quality processes to be described in a detailed spatial pattern, resolving sub-grid concentration distributions. Delft3D-PART is shown to be locally mass conservative (Postma et al., 2013). Modelling set up DELFT3D-FLOW calculated the hydrodynamic conditions for the southern North Sea for two consecutive years, 2004 and 2005. Meteorological conditions are important to determine the geographic destination of particles such as larvae, superimposed on the regular transport conditions in the southern North Sea. At the time of analysis, there were no hydrodynamic modelling results available for the years of sampling, 2014 to 2016. Instead, two model runs from 2004 and 2005 were used. Although there is large variation in climatic forcing between years, we chose these two years because of the overall comparable (southern) North Sea wind patterns during the months we used for PTM, i.e. March to June. The comparability especially regards wind directions and wind force. We could only roughly assess this comparability from meteorological data available to us (Royal Dutch Meteorological Institute); we did not do a detailed analysis. We assume that through this approach the differences between the hydrodynamic circulation patterns in the (southern) North Sea between these two periods is less than when random years would have been used. For the DELFT3D-PART model, each sampling location acted as an origin point of larvae and the density of the larvae throughout the consecutive months at the other locations (destinations) was calculated. Larval release was started at day 59 (1 March) of each year, from the top layer in the model. Both the timing and the period of particle release was based on the general reproductive timing and pelagic larval stage period of M. edulis. Mussels start spawning early spring, based on temperature of the water. Variation of spawning timing may result of the variation in temperature increase between years; in the southern North Sea this usually starts in March, and peaks in April/May or even later (De Vooys, 1999). Time from spawning of mussel larvae to settlement is around three months (Widdows, 1991). It was further assumed that the larvae are largely passive and that they are transported only by advection and general dispersion. They were also considered neutrally buoyant. Each origin released 1,489 particles per half hour, for 14 days (1,000,001 particles in total), after which no further release of particles occurred. The program calculated the horizontal transport and vertical dispersion to lower layers with time steps of 30 minutes for 70 days. Although mortality of M. edulis larvae is expected to be very high (Barker Jorgensen, 1981), this study did not include this aspect in the DELFT3D-PART model. The purpose of the study was to assess the maximum success of larvae settling at a specific destination, which was assumed to be proportional to the total number of larvae arriving at a specific destination throughout the 70 days. The total number of arriving particles from each source-destination combination was calculated and combined in a particle matrix. Data analysis Hybrid removal A mix of alleles of Mytilus galloprovincialis and M. trossulus were observed in our data at the partially species diagnostic locus Me15/16, and therefore we estimated the hybrid index h for each individual using a maximum likelihood approach that estimates the proportion of alleles inherited from one of two hybridizing species (Buerkle, 2005; Buerkle & Lexer, 2008). This approach was applied as implemented in the R package Introgress (Gompert & Alex Buerkle, 2010). The samples from Lisbon (M. galloprovincialis) and Limfjorden (M. edulis) were used as parental reference samples and locus Med379 was not taken into account due to high levels of missing data for several samples. All individuals identified as non-pure M. edulis (h < 1.0) were omitted from subsequent analyses, as this aspect would have affected the non-neutral influences on connectivity inferences. Isolation with migration analysis Effective gene flow between sampling locations was estimated for all possible pairs, using the coalescent approach implemented in the software 'Isolation with Migration' (IMa2p) (Hey & Nielsen, 2004; Sethuraman & Hey, 2016). The IMa2p model consists of subpopulations that are simulated backwards in time towards merging sometime in the past. Parameters for time since population divergence t, population sizes q and bidirectional migration rates m are estimated by a Metropolis-coupled Markov Chain Monte Carlo process. In order to not overfit the data we only ran simulations for pairs of samples. Coalescent simulation runs consisted of ten Markov Chain Monte Carlo chains with geometric heating (setting parameters ha = 0.99, hb = 0.75) and ten million steps after an initial burn-in period of five million steps. Parameters estimated and parameter ranges examined (in coalescent units) were three population sizes q (ancestral and two populations ensuing from population subdivision, range examined 0-100), two migration rates after population subdivision (both directions, range examined 0-1) and time since population subdivision t (range examined 0-10). Convergence of estimated parameter distributions was ensured by: checking effective sample size (ESS) values, autocorrelation values and chain swapping, examining trend line plots for absence of trends, and by comparing parameter estimates generated from the genealogies produced during the first and second half of runs. A mutation rate for the seven microsatellite loci of 0.001564 per generation was assumed, following the methodology by Luttikhuizen et al. (2018). Migration rates among sampled locations were visualised by chord diagrams using the R package Circlize version 0.4.3 (Gu, Gu, Eils, Schlesner, & Brors, 2014). The fit of the pairwise isolation-with-migration models to the data and the underlying processes was assessed by comparing the distribution of estimated migration rates with that of the pairwise FST values directly estimated from the microsatellite data. Pairwise FST values were converted to 2Nem values following the infinite island model approximation by Wright (Wright, 1943) in which FST = (1 + 4Nem)-1. Correspondence between 2Nem values stemming from FST estimation and from isolation-with-migration simulations was compared using Pearson rank correlation. Correlation was performed with the average between the two (bidirectional) migration rates stemming from isolation-with-migration simulations.

Alkylphenols, including 4-tert-butylphenol (C-4), 4n-pentylphenol (C-5), 4n-hexylphenol (C-6), and 4n-heptylphenol (C-7) up to 237 ppb concentrations, have been detected in produced water from oil platforms. Previous studies have shown that alkylphenols induce vitellogenesis in fish. Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) of both sexes were force-fed with various doses ranging between 0.02 and 80 ppm of a mixture of alkylphenols (C-4:C-5:C-6:C-7 ratio 1: 1: 1: 1) or 5 ppm 17beta-estradiol. We investigated effects on hepatic CYP1A and CYP3A protein expression in protein blots, using antibodies against scup (Stenotomus chrysops) CYP1A1 and rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) CYP3A. There was asexually dimorphic expression of CYP1A and CYP3A protein levels, with females expressing higher levels than males. Treatment of male Atlantic cod with 17beta-estradiol resulted in increased CYP1A and CYP3A protein levels. Exposure to alkylphenols resulted in a dose-dependent increase of CYP1A and CYP3A protein expression in males, but not in females. However, this increase of CYP1A protein levels was not reflected on the CYP1A-mediated ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase (EROD) activity, implying that alkylphenols inhibited the CYP1A enzyme activity in vivo. In vitro inhibition studies with pooled liver microsomes from Atlantic cod confirmed that the alkylphenols mixture efficiently inhibited the CYP1A activity (IC50 = 10 muM), although the inhibitory effect of each individual alkylphenol varied. The IC50 values for each individual alkylphenol on the CYP1A activity were, in a descending order of magnitude: [C-7 > C-6 > C-5 much greater than C-4], ranging from 12 to 300 muM with decreased length of the 4-alkyl chain. The effect of alkylphenols on the CYP3A activity in vitro in liver microsomes also was investigated, using the fluorescent 7-benzyloxy-4-[trifluoromethyl]-coumarin (BFC) as a diagnostic CYP3A substrate. The alkylphenol mixture inhibited CYP3A activity with IC50 value at 100 muM. The IC50 values for each individual alkylphenol on CYP3A activity were, in a descending order of magnitude: [C-5 > C-6 > C-7 > C-4] ranging between 60 and 250 muM. Taken together, our results show that the alkylphenol mixture and 17beta-estradiol resulted in elevated hepatic CYP1A and CYP3A expression in male Atlantic cod. The alkylphenol mixture strongly inhibited CYP1A activities, whereas it weakly inhibited CYP3A activity in Atlantic cod liver microsomes in vitro. In addition, 17beta-estradiol was a weak inhibitor of CYP3A activity (IC50 = 75 muM) and did not notably inhibit the CYP1A activity in vitro. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V.

In most cases, this tool works well. However, it is usually difficult to identify the source if the oil spill accident occurs during offshore petroleum exploration due to the highly similar physiochemical characteristics of suspected oils from the same drilling platform. In this report, a case study from the waters of the South China Sea is presented, and multidimensional scaling analysis (MDS) is introduced to demonstrate how oil fingerprints can be combined with mathematical methods to identify the source of spilled oil from highly similar suspected sources. The results suggest that the MDS calculation based on oil fingerprints and subsequently integrated with specific biomarkers in spilled oils is the most effective method with a great potential for determining the source in terms of highly similar suspected oils.

Using a combination of published and unpublished data, we compared the population structure of the salt marsh snail, Littoraria irrorata, between the South Atlantic Bight and the Gulf Coast of the United States to infer geographic differences in recruitment and to test the hypothesis that the Deepwater Horizon oil spill led to widespread recruitment failure of L. irrorata in Louisiana in 2010. Size-frequency distributions in both ecoregions were bimodal, with troughs in the distributions consistent with a transition from sub-adults to adults at similar to 13 mm in shell length as reported in the literature; however, adult snails reached larger sizes in the Gulf Coast. The ratio of sub-adults to adults was 1.5-2 times greater in the South Atlantic Bight than the Gulf Coast, consistent with higher recruitment rates in the South Atlantic Bight. Higher recruitment rates in the South Atlantic Bight could contribute to higher snail densities and reduced adult growth in this region. The ratio of sub-adults to adults in Louisiana was lower in 2011 than in previous years, and began to recover in 2012-2014, consistent with widespread recruitment failure in 2010, when large expanses of spilled oil were present in coastal waters. Our results reveal an important difference in the ecology of a key salt marsh invertebrate between the two ecoregions, and also suggest that the Deepwater Horizon oil spill may have caused widespread recruitment failure in this species and perhaps others with similar planktonic larval stages.",,,,,,,,,9,0,0,0,8,0,10,,,2150-8925,,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Houston, Dept Biol & Biochem, Houston, TX 77204 USARPI, Tallahassee, FL 32303 USANewFields, Atlanta, GA 30309 USAUniv Georgia, Dept Marine Sci, Athens, GA 30602 USANo Bones Coastal Biol Consultants LLC, 1114 Hyatt Ave, Murrells Inlet, SC 29576 USAAtkins, Jacksonville, FL 32256 USAFlorida Atlantic Univ, Harbor Branch, Oceanog Inst, Dept Biol Sci, 5600 US 1 N, Ft Pierce, FL 34946 USANortheastern Univ, Marine & Environm Sci, Nahant, MA 01908 USACoastal Carolina Univ, Dept Biol, POB 261954, Conway, SC 29528 USATampa Bay Water, Clearwater, FL 33761 USAUniv Florida, Dept Environm Engn Sci, Howard T Odum Ctr Wetlands, Gainesville, FL 32611 USAUniv S Alabama, Dept Marine Sci, Mobile, AL 36688 USANOAA, Emergency Response Div, Seattle, WA 98115 USAUS Geol Survey, Wetland & Aquat Res Ctr, Lafayette, LA 70506 USACoastal Carolina Univ, Dept Marine Sci, POB 261954, Conway, SC 29528 USA",RPINewFieldsNo Bones Coastal Biol Consultants LLCAtkinsTampa Bay Water,,,2017-01-11,WOS:000390136700018,,

However, knowledge about investment behavior, experience with working with these investors, and ways to engage investors in the Blue Growth sectors is lacking. This paper examines this knowledge gap. It characterizes investors and identifies investor behavior, investors' motives, and conditions and criteria relevant for investors to invest in Blue Growth sectors. The presented results are derived from a literature study on investors and investment behavior, an electronic survey and in-depth interviews. Stereotypical images of private equity bankers or wealthy individuals do not do justice to the diversity of investors involved in the Blue Growth sectors. These sectors are still in development and various risks reduce the willingness to invest. Risk mitigation should be seen as a shared responsibility of entrepreneurs, investors and governments. Government support must go further than financial support for research and development or technological demonstration projects. Proven technologies get stuck in the Valley of Death as investors alone are not willing to take the risk associated with upscaling of promising technologies. Tied in a reciprocal relationship, governments need to attract private investors-their capital, knowledge, and networks-to further grow of the Blue Growth sectors while investors need stable, predictable, and effective government support schemes to mitigate their financial risks.",,,,,,,,,15,0,0,0,2,0,16,,,,2296-7745,,,,,,,,,,"Wageningen Econ Res, The Hague, NetherlandsWageningen Environm Res, Wageningen, NetherlandsBusiness Models Inc, Amsterdam, NetherlandsUniv Coll Cork, MaREI Environm Res Inst, Cork, Ireland",Business Models Inc,,,2017-01-01,WOS:000457690200017,,

In order to understand the contribution of kelp metabolism to local biogeochemistry, we must first quantify the natural variability and the relative contributions of physical and biological drivers to biogeochemical changes in space and time. We deployed an extensive instrument array in Monterey Bay, CA, inside and outside of a kelp forest to assess the degree to which giant kelp (Macrocystis pyrifera) locally ameliorates present-day acidic conditions which we expect to be exacerbated by OA. Temperature, pH, and O-2 variability occurred at semidiurnal, diurnal (tidal and diel), and longer upwelling event periods. Mean conditions were driven by offshore wind forcing and the delivery of upwelled water via nearshore internal bores. While near-surface pH and O-2 were similar inside and outside the kelp forest, surface pH was elevated inside the kelp compared to outside, suggesting that the kelp canopy locally increased surface pH. We observed the greatest acidification stress deeper in the water column where pCO(2) reached levels as high as 1,300 mu atm and aragonite undersaturation (omega(Ar) < 1) occurred on several occasions. At this site, kelp canopy modification of seawater properties, and thus any ameliorating effect against acidification, is greatest in a narrow band of surface water. The spatial disconnect between stress exposure at depth and reduction of acidification stress at the surface warrants further assessment of utilizing kelp forests as provisioners of local OA mitigation.",,,,,,,,,20,0,0,0,11,0,30,,,2169-9275,2169-9291,,,,,,,,,,"Stanford Univ, Dept Earth Syst Sci, Stanford, CA 94305 USACalif State Univ Northridge, Dept Biol, Northridge, CA 91330 USAMonterey Bay Aquarium Res Inst, Moss Landing, CA USAStanford Univ, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Stanford, CA 94305 USA",,,,2020-12-22,WOS:000595724300028,,

Sloshing can produce big problems so is essential to apply the prevention measures. For example in water ballast tanks, the sloshing motion of sea water inside of ballast tanks will bring large fluid pressures and impact loads, which might destroy the structure of tanks. It is known that ships with larger tanks, less internal structure, and more free surface area, the number of failures attributed to sloshing liquids have increased. Nowadays it is recognized that the ballast tanks which may be partly filled are the crucial group of tanks onboard. The problem of an assessment of liquid sloshing effect is more important than ever because of the obligatory ballast water management requirement. Our paper is an original fluid structure interaction analysis during sloshing phenomenon. We are using ANSYS CFX to simulate the behavior of two fluids, (seawater and air from the ballast tank), requires itself the multiphase flow model. Due to the movement of the ballast/cargo tanks is complex involving pitching and rolling of ship, it is clear that the simulation is done with the ANSYS CFX transient module.

Although diatoms are regularly used as indicators in rivers and in lakes, less is known about the benthic diatom communities in wetland systems, especially in Italy. The main aim of the project was to provide a contribution to the knowledge oil distribution, composition and structure of benthic diatom communities in wetland systems in Italy. In 2005, we investigated the benthic diatom communities and their relationships to water variables of nine ponds and wetlands along the Tyrrhenian coast near Rome. Furthermore, a first application of seven European diatom-based indices on this type of water body was undertaken. A total of 225 species and varieties belonging to 54 genera were identified. The Canonical Correspondence Analysis indicated that certain species were closely associated with each wetland type and their distribution mainly depended on nutrient and chloride contents: pollution tolerant species (i.e. Litticola goeppertiana, Mayamaea atomus, Navicula subminuscula) in the wetlands connected to river mouths, halophilous species and also marine littoral species (i. e. Nitzschia elegantula, Amphora coffaeformis, Achnanthes brevipes var. intermedia, Epithemia adnata var. porcellus) in the coastal brackish ponds and wetlands, and less eutrophic species (i. e. Achnanthidium minuttissimum, A. biasolettianum) in the lowland freshwater wetland. In general, the indices classified most of the studied water bodies as bad, poor and moderate status; few sites were classified into a good class, even for at least in one sampling occasion. Eutrophication and Pollution Index (EPI-D), Trophic Diatorn Index (TDI), Taxa Pollution Tolerant (%PT), Pollution Sensitivity Index (IPS) and Generic Diatom Index (IDG) were significantly correlated to nutrient contents in the studied wetlands.

Shell intended to 'dump' the buoy in the deep North Atlantic. The aftermath of the occupation and associated publicity was a change of policy about the disposal of the Spar by Shell, Europe's largest multinational company. The article considers alternative explanations for policy change - most importantly the influential propositions by Baumgartner and Tones (1993). The general importance of their work means that the opportunity is taken to set out their themes at some length, but the particular case suggests that their notion of change stemming from a redefinition of the problem may only imperfectly fit sudden policy changes of the Brent Spar type. The article argues that their 'venue shopping' concept better illuminates the case - but the significant venue change was geographical - i.e. from Britain to Germany rather than institutional - i.e. from a policy community to an issue network. The case study superficially accords with an influential body of literature in the 1980s and 1990s that sees outcomes as changing through the mobilization of a wider range of participants in issue networks, but it is argued that there is no automatic link between an expanded roster of participants and outcomes if the decisive decisionmaking power is retained in the original closed system. The case study suggests there can be an illusion of an issue network when the dominance of a policy monopoly is publicly challenged - but where decision-making power is retained among original participants.",,,,,,,,,12,0,0,0,0,0,15,,,0033-3298,,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Aberdeen, Dept Polit & Int Relat, Aberdeen AB9 1FX, Scotland",,,,1998-12-01,WOS:000077805900006,,

Abiotic and biotic site characteristics were investigated by water analysis for each sampling cycle. Further, data of contaminant loads of the softbody and pollutant concentration of the water column, suspended particles and sediments from both sites were analysed. Results show that positive offshore effects due to dilution of contamination were not evident for all parameters analysed. Condition indices were high, and parasites were not present in offshore mussels. In contrast, the integrative health parameter LMS and growth performance were slightly, but not significantly, better in the nearshore cultivated mussels. These findings correspond with the higher contaminant concentrations in the softbodies of mussels and the water column from the offshore testing site. Both sites showed low LMS values and high accumulations of lipofuscin and neutral lipids, indicating that environmental conditions in the German Bight are generating stress for blue mussels even in the offshore areas.

Three profiles of high-resolution sub-bottom profiler reveal the existence of five gas seeps (G96, GS1, GS2, GS3 and GS4) and one pockmark (PM) in the study area. Gas seeps and pockmark PM are shown in lines A and C, while no gas venting feature is observed along line B. This is the first time that a gas-hydrate related pockmark structure has been imaged off SW Taiwan. The relatively high backscatter intensity in our sidescan sonar images indicates the existence of authigenic carbonates or chemosynthetic communities on the seafloor. More than 2,000 seafloor photos obtained by a deep-towed camera (TowCam) system confirm the relatively high backscatter intensity of sidescan sonar images related to bacteria mats and authigenic carbonates formation at gas seep G96 and pockmark PM areas. Water column gas flares are observed in sidescan sonar images along lines A and C. Likewise, EK500 echo sounder images display the gas plumes above gas seep G96, pockmark PM and gas seep GS1; the gas plumes heights reach about 150, 100 and 20 m from seafloor, respectively. Based on multichannel seismic reflection (MCS) profiles, an anticline structure trending NNE-SSW is found beneath gas seep G96, pockmark PM and gas seep GS2. It implies that the gas venting features are related to the anticline structure. A thermal fluid may migrate from the anticline structure to the ridge crest, then rises up to the seafloor along faults or fissures. The seafloor characteristics indicate that the gas seep G96 area may be in a transitional stage from the first to second stage of a gas seep self-sealing process, while the pockmark PM area is from the second to final stage. In the pockmark PM area, gas venting is observed at eastern flank but not at the bottom while authigenic carbonates are present underneath the pockmark. It implies that the fluid migration pathways could have been clogged by carbonates at the bottom and the current pathway has shifted to the eastern flank of the pockmark during the gas seep self-sealing process.",,,,,,,,,55,7,0,0,6,0,59,,,0025-3235,1573-0581,,,,,,,,,,"Minist Econ Affairs, Cent Geol Survey, Taipei 23568, TaiwanNatl Cent Univ, Inst Geophys, Chungli 32001, Taiwan",Minist Econ Affairs,,,2010-03-01,WOS:000283306400011,,

However, the link between oil spills and HABs is still unknown. Here, we present experimental evidence that demonstrates a connection between oil spills and HABs. We determined the effects of oil, dispersant-treated oil, and dispersant alone on the structure of natural plankton assemblages in the Northern Gulf of Mexico. In coastal waters, large tintinnids and oligotrich ciliates, major grazers of phytoplankton, were negatively affected by the exposure to oil and dispersant, whereas bloom-forming dinoflagellates (Prorocentrum texanum, P. triestinum, and Scrippsiella trochoidea) notably increased their concentration. The removal of key grazers due to oil and dispersant disrupts the predator prey controls (top-down controls) that normally function in plankton food webs. This disruption of grazing pressure opens a loophole that allows certain dinoflagellates with higher tolerance to oil and dispersants than their grazers to grow and form blooms when there are no growth limiting factors (e.g., nutrients). Therefore, oil spills and dispersants can act as disrupters of predator prey controls in plankton food webs and as indirect inducers of potentially harmful dinoflagellate blooms.",,,,,,,,,36,1,0,0,20,0,37,,,0013-936X,1520-5851,,,,,,,,,,"Tech Univ Denmark, Ctr Ocean Life, DK-2800 Lyngby, DenmarkUniv Texas Austin, Inst Marine Sci, Port Aransas, TX 78373 USA",,,,2018-05-31,WOS:000432417400023,29659258,

In combination with source data, the two oil groups may be extrapolated into two end-member oils: petroleum populations A and B. The oil population A with abundant 4-methylsteranes, derived from the deeper Wenchang source rocks, migrated and accumulated earlier. The oil population B with absent 4methylsteranes was expelled from the Enping source rocks and is associated with a relatively later phase of migration and accumulation. The two distinctive oil populations migrated updip through the marine blanket-like sandstone carriers within the Zhuhai Formation to accumulate in a series of traps along the main migration pathways at different times. Most of the accumulations are mixtures of the two end-member oils. The variations of 4-methylsterane concentrations in the accumulations can be related to the contributions from the two sources: the oils, which migrated furthest, contain greater contributions from the Wenchang source rocks, whereas those with shorter migration paths have greater contributions from the Enping sources. The later migrated oils closer to the depression areas are highly mature and the former oils in the Liuhua oil fields are of relatively low maturity, which may indicate the main migration direction along the Hui-Liu Structure Ridge (HLSR). Oils with abnormally high maturity in the middle of the HLSR may suggest oil-filling points, from which branch conduits connected the source kitchens to the main migration pathway. Oils with abnormally low maturities may reveal minor contributions from some small sags in the Dongsha Massif in a latest phase. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

Our results show that periods of enhanced bottom currents associated with diurnal shelf waves, internal semidiurnal tides, and also wind-generated near-inertial motions can modulate methane seepage. Flow dependent destruction of gas hydrates within the hydrate stability field is possible from enhanced bottom currents when hydrates are not covered by either seafloor biota or sediments. The calculated seepage varied between 40-400 mu mol CH4 m(-2) s(-1). This is 1-3 orders of magnitude higher than dissolution rates of buried hydrates through permeable sediments and well within the experimentally derived range for exposed gas hydrates under different hydrodynamic boundary conditions. We conclude that submarine canyons which display high hydrodynamic activity can become key areas of enhanced seepage as a result of emerging weather patterns due to climate change.

(NSI), Renewable Energy Group has developed a project management plan to develop Power from the Sea Technologies in well defined phases. Using a multi-phase process, NSI will first provide renewable power solutions to military bases and then to residential communities, state and local businesses. The NSI Renewable Energy Group has focused their project management expertise in three types of renewable energy: Off-Shore Wind Turbines (OSWTs); Current/Tide Energy Converters (C/TECs); and Wave Energy Converters (WECs). Solar energy is an area of planned expansion for the group. This paper includes an outline of the NSI Renewable Energy Group project management approach for WEC projects, a discussion of various wave energy technologies, including their states of development and commercialization potential, non-grid connected applications for WECs are discussed including distributed generation, powering desalination plants, hydrogen generation, and beach erosion abatement.The NSI Wave Renewable Energy Group consists of experts in weather and wave modeling, environmental permitting, WEC performance modeling for project specific siting plans, and economic modeling, to determine an accurate forecast of the project cost of energy and internal rate of return. NSI uses the Distributed Integrated Ocean Prediction System (DIOPS) to estimate the wave energy in the customer's area of interest, to determine the ocean wave energy resource potential available for a particular customer. DIOPS allows for deep-water waves to be propagated across ocean basins, using the WAve Model (WAM), over the shelf, using a variety of nearshore wave models including, Delft Hydraulics Simulating Waves Nearshore (SWAN), the Steady-state WAVE model (STWAVE), and the REFraction/DIFfraction model (REF/DIF). DIOPS can also propagate the resultant wave spectra into the surf zone, via the Navy Standard Surf Model (NSSM). Using an extensive database of WEC developers, NSI is able to determine the optimum performing and economically efficient WECs, which can be employed in the customer's operating area. At the same time, NSI has personnel experienced in obtaining the necessary environmental permits for installing the best performing WEC, that conforms to the environmental sensitivities of the area. By using existing commercial technologies, and applying them to the customer's need, NSI is able to develop green energy solutions, which meet both the customer's power requirements and monetary budgets.",,,,,MTS/IEEE Oceans 2002 ConferenceMTS/IEEE Oceans 2002 Conference,"OCT 29-31, 2002OCT 29-31, 2002",Marine Technol Soc; IEEE; OESMarine Technol Soc; IEEE; OES,"BILOXI, MSBILOXI, MS",5,0,0,0,0,0,5,,,,,0-7803-7534-3,,,,,,,,,"Neptune Sci Inc, Renewable Energy Grp, Barnett Ctr, San Diego, CA 92110 USA",Neptune Sci Inc,,,2002-01-01,WOS:000182293200253,,

This paper studied the chemical and electrical characteristics of a new AC 500kV XLPE submarine cable insulation with different thermal aging condition. Results show that the aging rate is greatly accelerated after the occurrence of white opaque patches. In the thermal aging process, the carbonyl peak at 1710 cm-1 gradually increased. A new peak appeared at 1170 cm-1, which was the stretching vibration peak of -C=O-. The carbonyl index increases continuously. XRD results show that the height of the diffraction peak significantly decreases and only one diffraction peak remains after 160 days aging. As the aging time increases, the a relaxation peaks of the XLPE samples have a tendency to shift to lower temperature.

Then joint return periods of different ocean environmental parameters are determined from the view of service term and danger risk. Based on a bivariate equivalent maximum entropy distribution, joint design parameters are estimated for the concomitant wave height and wind speed at a site in the Bohai Sea. The calculated results show that even if the return period of each environmental factor, such as wave height or wind speed, is small, their combinations can lead to larger joint return periods.

Seedlings representing 25 populations of Pseudotsuga menziesii and 26 populations of Pinus ponderosa were grown in a common garden in Moscow, ID, USA. The seeds were collected across the natural distribution of each species, at altitudes ranging from 170 to 2774 m above sea level, latitudes from 33 degrees N to 53 degrees N, and longitudes from 105 degrees W to 124 degrees W. Lipid-free seeds from mother trees and leaf tissue from the 2-year-old progeny were analysed. The design enabled us not only to measure genetically determined variation in carbon isotope discrimination (Delta) and gas exchange characteristics but also to compare performance in the common garden and in situ.2. In the common garden, significant population variation in Delta, gas exchange and specific leaf area was detected among seedlings of Pseudotsuga menziesii. Coastal, low-altitude genotypes had significantly lower Delta than interior, high-altitude genotypes. In Pinus ponderosa, populations varied only in specific leaf area. These broadly distributed sympatric species differ in genetic structure with respect to gas-exchange characteristics.3. In the common garden, high Delta of both species was associated with high stomatal conductance relative to photosynthetic rate. Specific leaf area, although strongly correlated with Delta, varied in the wrong direction to explain variation in Delta.4. In situ Delta was correlated with both altitude and vapour pressure deficit (VPD) in Pseudotsuga menziesii (r(2)=0.42, P=0.002 and r(2)=0.25, P<0.02 for altitude and VPD, respectively), but not in Pinus ponderosa (r(2)=0.004, P>0.77 and r(2)=0.06, P>0.21 for altitude and VPD, respectively).5. Foliage Delta from the progeny grown in the common garden was significantly correlated, in both species, with Delta of the in situ maternal photosynthate in the seeds; however, the correlation was negative in Pseudotsuga menziesii and positive in Pinus ponderosa. The negative correlation indicates a strong acclimatory response, perhaps to VPD, in Pseudotsuga menziesii.6. Altitudinal decreases in intercellular CO2 partial pressures inferred from isotopic data were insufficient to compensate for increased VPD. Photosynthetic water-use efficiency (net photosynthesis/transpiration) was estimated to decrease by two- to fourfold from sea level to 2800 m altitude within the distribution limits of these species.",,,,,,,,,89,7,0,0,56,0,105,,,0269-8463,,,,,,,,,,,"UNIV IDAHO,DEPT FOREST RESOURCES,MOSCOW,ID 83843",,,,1995-06-01,WOS:A1995RF96900007,,

Multivariate clustering based on the shape of the local climatological seasonal cycle divides the study area into four groups: two with spring-summer maxima representing the northern and southern coastal upwelling zones, one with a summer minimum offshore in mid-latitudes and a fourth with very weak seasonality in between. Multivariate clustering on the seasonal cycles from all 13 years produces the same four seasonal cycle types and provides a view of the interannual variability in seasonal biogeography. Over the study period these seasonal cycles generally appear in similar locations as the climatological clusters. However, considerable interannual variability in the geography of the seasonal cycles is evident across the CCS, the most spatially extensive of which are associated with the 1997-1999 El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) signal and the 2005 delayed spring transition off the Oregon and northern and central California coasts. We quantify linear trends over the study period in the seasonal timing of the two seasonal cycles that represent the biologically productive coastal upwelling zones using four different metrics of phenology. In the northern upwelling region, the date of the spring maximum is delaying (1.34 days yr(-1)) and the central tendency of the summer elevated chlorophyll period is advancing (0.63 days yr(-1)). In the southern coastal upwelling region, both the initiation and cessation of the spring maximum are delaying (1.78 days yr(-1) and 2.44 days yr(-1), respectively) and the peak is increasing in duration over the study period. Connections between observed interannual shifts in phytoplankton seasonality and physical forcing, expressed as either basin-scale climate signals or local forcing, show phytoplankton seasonality in the CCS to be influenced by changes in the seasonality of the wind mixing power offshore, coastal upwelling in the near-shore regions and basin-scale signals such as ENSO across the study area.

This could potentially lead to opposition and spatial conflict. The successful development of the MRE sector will heavily depend on the acceptance of projects by fishing communities. Effective stakeholder engagement is crucial to enhancing acceptance among fishermen. The consultation process is one of the key ways in which to engage fishermen and enable them to participate in decision-making. There is agreement among experts in the field that despite its importance, the consultation process is not effective and it is often carried out from the top down with little opportunity for real participation. A mixed methods research approach was used to examine the experiences of fishermen on their level of involvement in consultations and decision-making on marine renewable energy projects. In total, 104 surveys and 14 in-depth interviews were carried out with fishermen operating from ports at three case study sites around the island of Ireland where MRE projects were being developed. Just over half (56%) of those surveyed felt that they had been involved in consultations, while only 22% felt that they had been involved in decisions made on the projects. The use of participatory mapping tools in the selection of sites for MRE development provides an opportunity for fishermen to influence decisions. Designing and implementing marine spatial plans could also help to provide clarity and transparency over how trade-offs in the use of sea space are dealt with. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

The programme has been based on the development of a laboratory technique for the preparation of reconstituted soil samples containing a uniform distribution of gas bubbles. The structure of these samples is similar to that observed in sediment recovered from the sea bed, and consists of large gas-filled cavities surrounded by a matrix of saturated soil. It is found that surface tension effects limit the difference between gas pressure and pore water pressure, and that the overall void size is effectively a function of the strength of the matrix, so that changes in void volume may be modelled by cavity expansion and contraction in an ideal plastic medium, leading to limits on the difference between gas pressure and mean total stress. A new parameter, operative stress, is shown to influence both the consolidation and the strength of these gassy soils. Thus, during consolidation, the gas volume is controlled by the total stress and the water volume by the operative stress; the undrained shear strength may be increased or decreased by the presence of the gas, depending on the specific values of total stress and operative stress. The operative stress for a gassy soil may therefore be seen as being analogous in its definition (total stress minus pore water pressure) to the effective stress for a saturated soil, but different from the effective stress in that it does not, on its own, control the strains and strength.

Influenced by both land and sea, salt marshes are unique ecosystems and their productivity and respiration responses to precipitation change differ from those observed in terrestrial ecosystems. How salt marsh greenhouse gas fluxes and sediment microbial communities will respond to climate-induced precipitation changes is largely unknown. We conducted 1-year precipitation manipulation experiments in the Spartina patens (high marsh) zone of two salt marshes and quantified ecosystem functions at both and microbial community structure at one. Precipitation treatments (doubled rainfall, extreme drought, and seasonal intensification) had a significant, although transient, impact on porewater salinity following storms at both sites, but most site conditions (nutrient concentrations, sediment moisture, and temperature) were unaffected. Extreme drought led to a subtle change in microbial community structure, but most ecosystem functions (primary productivity, litter decomposition, and greenhouse gas fluxes) were not affected by precipitation changes. The absence of ecosystem function change indicates functional redundancy (under extreme drought) and resistance (under doubled precipitation and seasonal intensification) exist in the microbial community. Our findings demonstrate that salt marsh ecosystems can maintain function (including ecosystem services like carbon sequestration) under even the most extreme precipitation change scenarios, due to resistance, resilience, and functional redundancy in the underlying microbial community.Plain Language Summary Precipitation change, especially the intensification of precipitation events (e.g., longer droughts and stronger storms) is an important aspect of human-caused global climate change. Salt marshes are important hotspots for carbon sequestration, so if precipitation changes alter the microbial processes that drive carbon burial and greenhouse gas emissions in salt marshes, there could be an important feedback to the climate system. How salt marsh greenhouse gas fluxes and sediment microbial communities will respond to precipitation changes is largely unknown, so we conducted 1-year precipitation experiments in two salt marshes. We found that precipitation treatments (doubled rainfall, extreme drought, and seasonal intensification) had a significant impact on porewater salinity following storms, and one of the precipitation treatments (extreme drought) led to a subtle change in microbial community structure. However, ecosystem functions including greenhouse gas fluxes were not affected by any precipitation changes, regardless of changes to the microbial community. Our findings demonstrate that salt marsh ecosystems can maintain their functions (including valuable ecosystem services like carbon sequestration) under even the most extreme precipitation change scenarios, due to the stability of the underlying microbial community.",,,,,,,,,15,0,0,0,14,0,16,,,2169-8953,2169-8961,,,,,,,,,,"Boston Univ, Dept Earth & Environm, Boston, MA 02215 USAHarvard Univ, Dept Organism & Evolutionary Biol, Cambridge, MA 02138 USABoston Univ, Dept Biol, 5 Cummington St, Boston, MA 02215 USA",,,,2019-08-13,WOS:000477719600003,,

Since then there have been major changes in many seabird populations throughout Scotland (Foster & Marrs 2012). A number of development locations have been identified for the generation of renewable energy from offshore wind, tidal and wave energy at sites along the east coast of Scotland and across the Pentland Firth and Orkney Waters. It is important to have up to date information on the current status of the north Caithness seabird populations. Main findings Seabird counts undertaken in 2015 and 2016 within the SPA revealed: - Northern fulmar - 13,405 AOS in 2015/16, 7% lower than 1999 and part of a slow decline since 1986. - European shag - 170 AON, 66% higher than 1999. - Black-legged kittiwake - 5,568 AON, a decline of 55% since1999 and 64% since 1986. - Herring gull - 232 AOT, 33% higher than in 1999. - Great black-backed gull - 68 AOT, an increase of 81% since 1999. - Common guillemot - 38,863 birds, a decline of 53% since 1999, but still 93% higher than the numbers present in 1986. - Razorbill - 3,503 birds, an increase of 39% since1999 and a continuation of a long term 112% increase since 1986. - Atlantic puffin - 3,053 birds counted, 55% lower than the 1999 count, but just 13% lower than the numbers present in 1986. - The long-term trend for the four key SPA species shows that generally they have fared better at the North Caithness Cliffs SPA when compared with the overall Scottish trend. Although the long-term decline in black-legged kittiwake is similar to the Scottish trend, the decline in northern fulmar is far less and for common guillemot and razorbill the overall increase is greater. - Changes in methodology between the 1999/2000 and 2015/2016 surveys may have had some effects on these results, but these were thought to be minor.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,1759-4014,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2019-03-28,ZOOREC:ZOOR15504019331,,

The sediments studied are composed of biochemical carbonate-evaporite mineral suites, such as calcite, dolomite, aragonite and gypsum, as well as elastic minerals, such as quartz, feldspar and serpentine. These sediments were also strongly influenced by microbial activities as reflected by the presence of cyanobacterial mats, boring, gas bubble structures, pustular and other macro and micro textures. A combination of marine, fluvial, aeolian, and groundwater processes shaped the geomorphology of the area and led to the formation of such mineral suites, as well as their microbial contents. Data collected from Mars indicate that its surface regolith contains sandstone composed of siliciclastic basaltic debris, as well as carbonate (e.g. magnesite) and evaporite (e.g. jarosite and relics of gypsum) mineral assemblages. Additional data suggest the presence of geomorphic features, characteristic of an arid climate, such as sand dunes and desert varnish. The hydrological model for the Late Noachian-Hesperian period of the plant proposed the existence of a surficial layer containing endolithic and stromatolitic cyanobacterial lamina. The combination of the coastal sabkha of Abu Dhabi with its carbonate-evaporite mineral suites, the neighbouring sand dune fields of the Empty Quarter Desert and the basaltic sediments resulted from weathering the ophiolitic Northern Oman Mountains to form a candidate terrestrial geologic province that may explain the mineral association of Mars and its potential biosignatures. The lithological features and the mineral association of the sabkha can be recognized by the present day detection equipment used on Mars, and even if their biosignatures are degraded, their existence may be inferred from these features.",,,,,,,,,6,0,0,0,2,0,6,,,1473-5504,1475-3006,,,,,,,,,,"Qatar Univ, Ctr Environm Studies, Doha, QatarUniv Texas Permian Basin, Environm Sci Program, Odessa, TX 79762 USAUniv Bradford, Sch Life Sci, Bradford BD7 1DO, W Yorkshire, EnglandUnited Arab Emirates Univ, Dept Geol, Al Ain, U Arab Emirates",,,,2010-07-01,WOS:000278918700002,,

These activities may lead to increased REE concentrations in sediments the primary habitat of European eels. In the present work, REE bioaccumulation was evaluated by determining the concentrations in yellow and silver eel muscles sampled at three different locations in the Loire estuary and at two periods (2011/2012 and 2018/2019). The aims of this study were the understanding of the spatio-temporal influences (sampling site and sampling period) and intraspecific variations (age, sex, sexual maturation, length, weight, and parasitism) on the whole REE bioaccumulation. The mean value of the sum of REE concentrations (Sigma REES) was 2.91, 6.48 and 12.60 mu g/kg of muscle from respectively yellow eels, female silver eels and male silver eels fished in 2018/2019. The results showed that silver males accumulated more REEs than silver females and silver eels accumulate more REEs than yellow ones. Regarding the determination of spatio-temporal variations, an increase of REE concentrations for silver eel muscles between the two periods was observed, certainly related to the increase of REE uses. Finally, a trend of higher contamination of eels sampled in the downstream of Nantes was noticed for yellow eels. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

First, as animals evolved from heterothermic ectotherms to homeothermic endoderms with their corresponding increase in the ability to sustain high oxygen consumptions, the blood-gas barrier had to become successively thinner, and also provide an increasingly large area for diffusive gas exchange. Second, the barrier had to find a way to maintain its mechanical integrity in the face of extreme thinness, and this was assisted by the increasing separation of the pulmonary from the systemic circulation. A remarkable feature throughout the evolution of air-breathing vertebrates has been the tight conservation of the tripartite structure of the blood-gas barrier with its three layers: capillary endothelium, extracellular matrix, and alveolar epithelium. The strength of the barrier can be ascribed to the very thin layer of type IV collagen in the extracellular matrix. In the phylogenic progression from amphibia and reptiles to mammals and birds, the blood-gas barrier became successively thinner. Also, the area increased greatly reflecting the greater oxygen demands of the organism. The gradual separation of the pulmonary from the systemic circulation continued from amphibia through reptiles to mammals and birds. Only in the last two classes are the circulations completely separate with the result that the pulmonary capillary pressures can be maintained low enough to avoid stress failure of the blood-gas barrier. Remarkably, the barrier is generally much thinner in birds than mammals, and it is also much more uniform in thickness. These advantages for gas exchange can be explained by the support of avian pulmonary capillaries by the surrounding air capillaries. This arrangement was made possible by the adoption of the flow-through system of ventilation in birds as opposed to the reciprocating pattern in mammals. (C) 2011 American Physiological Society.

Such observations are particularly critical for the developing offshore wind energy community. An autonomous surface vehicle was deployed within the Massachusetts Wind Energy Area, located south of Martha's Vineyard, Massachusetts, for one month, collecting wind observations that were used to test models of wind-wave spreading and HF radar energy loss, thereby empirically relating radar-measured power to surface winds. HF radar-based extractions of the remote wind speed had accuracies of 1.4 m s(-1) for winds less than 7 m s(-1), within the optimal range of the radar frequency used. Accuracies degraded at higher winds due to low signal-to-noise ratios in the returned power and poor resolution of the model.

The integration of petrographic analysis of carbonate rocks, stable isotope measurements and seismic interpretation provided new insights into the diagenetic history of the Upper Burman Limestone reservoir. The high (28%) average porosity of the reservoir is dominantly related to strong development of microporosity, moldic and vuggy porosity. Mud-supported, coral-rich sediments record significant early marine dissolution of aragonite and early lithification of matrix that has led to the development of dense layers. Stable isotope and petrographic data from the top of the reservoir suggest that the long-term depositional hiatus (middle to late Miocene) was related to platform drowning and non-deposition in a deep marine setting. Moderate dolomitization has affected the top and flanks of the platform during the depositional hiatus. Microporosity development and sparry calcite cementation mainly occurred in marine to marine shallow burial environments. A major decrease in porosity, averaging 10%, below the gas-water contact suggests a major phase of porosity evolution during and/or after the hydrocarbon emplacement which is mainly related to 1) increased moldic and vuggy porosity development within the gas zone, 2) microporosity preservation in loosely-packed, subrounded micrites within the gas zone, and 3) microporosity reduction by calcite precipitation within the water zone leading to the development of densely-packed, euhedral micrites.",,,,,,,,,16,2,0,0,1,0,16,,,0264-8172,1873-4073,,,,,,,,,,"Aix Marseille Univ, CNRS, IRD, CEREGE,UM 34, 3 Pl Victor Hugo,Case 67, F-13331 Marseille 03, FranceCSTJF, TOTAL, Ave Larribau, F-64018 Pau, France",,,,2019-10-25,WOS:000490044500040,,

The broadband hearing threshold sound pressure levels (SPLs) of two harbor seals for signals from two AMDs were similar (63-69 dB re 1 mu Pa, rms). Effects of the AMDs on the seals' behavior were quantified at three SPLs: one which just did not cause behavioral changes, one which caused one of the seals to haul out occasionally, and one which caused one of the seals to haul out more than 10% of the time. The corresponding mean received SPLs were, respectively, Ace Aquatec: 109, 124, and 134 dB re 1 mu Pa, rms; Lofitech: 128, 133, and 138 dB re 1 mu Pa, rms.

J,,,,,,,,,Jacqueline Tweddle,,A bottom up approach to marine management: Marine phytoplankton as regulators of ecosystem functions and services,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Awarded Grant,Oct 31 2016,2016,"Microscopic marine algae (phytoplankton) are crucially important to climate cycle and marine ecosystem functions, and support a range of ecosystem services (ES). Vital ES carried out by phytoplankton include oxygen production, uptake of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere into the ocean, and sustaining marine food-webs. Phytoplankton have spatially and temporally distinct distributions, with some locations consistently supporting greater primary production, with subsequent impacts on the distributions of supported ecosystem functions and ES including populations of seabirds, marine mammals and commercial fisheries. However, phytoplankton are given little consideration within marine management, with little use made of research into phytoplankton, and their relationships with other ecosystem functions and ES. This is a major knowledge gap and limits the effectiveness of marine management. This fellowship will address this evidence gap to provide a robust evidence-based framework to aid marine management. I will work closely with Marine Management Organisation (MMO) and bodies with similar functions in Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales to ensure this evidence base is considered in marine planning and licencing processes. For example, my recent work shows wind farms can cause an up to 30% decrease in annual primary production, but that this can be mitigated through smaller turbine bases or siting turbines out of phytoplankton hotspots.The goal of this fellowship is to facilitate the MMO in achieving sustainable development through ecosystems-based management as supported by robust scientific evidence. Key objectives include analysing and evaluating information (much of it funded by NERC) on the spatial and temporal relationships between phytoplankton and supported ecosystem functions and ES and establishing how this information can be best used to improve the sustainable management of our oceans, contributing to filling MMO evidence gaps. Deliverables include reports for the MMO based on analysis of published results and, primarily, visiting key researchers and research groups, and participating in conferences and working groups - thus actively incorporating the leading edge of research, whilst encouraging researchers to engage with marine managers. Training will be delivered to MMO staff on using the ES concept in marine management and stakeholder engagement, furthering its use by the MMO.I have experience in oceanographic research and marine management, and will use both sets of expertise in this fellowship - using science expertise to collate and synthesise high-quality research, and management expertise to facilitate targeted and strategic communications with the MMO in order to apply cutting-edge science to MMO objectives. This, in combination with extensive time spend at the MMO offices, will ensure that the needs of the MMO are well understood and prioritised, and that scientific evidence is useful and presented accessibly.There is a lack of engagement between researchers in the fellowship topics and marine managers - researchers are unclear how to engage with marine management (e.g. who to contact and how to present information), and management organisations are often unaware of current research. A key objective of this fellowship is therefore to encourage engagement between researchers and the MMO. Deliverables include a workshop to establish best practice for knowledge exchange between scientists and marine managers. I will develop an outreach activity for the MMO, educating researchers on why and how to use their research to support marine management. To facilitate future engagement, beyond the fellowship, I will use my extensive network to generate an Experts in Support of Marine Management (ESMM) database product for the MMO, simplifying locating experts in a topic. This fellowship will build a lasting, productive relationship between the MMO and the biological oceanography community in the UK, and beyond.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,NE/P005756/1,,,,,,,,University of Aberdeen,,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:15395448,,

As a complementary part of the preceding work, this study focuses on the standardization of surface wind speeds with marine exposures. The effect of wind strength on the roughness of the sea surface is further taken into account, with emphasis on the difference between deep-ocean and shallow-water cases. As an application example, wind measurements at a buoy site near the coastal line (water depth is 14 m) are adjusted to their potential values, which are then compared with those at a nearby station. The good agreement between the two sets of results demonstrates the accuracy and effectiveness of the standardization method. It is also found that the behavior of roughness length scale over shallow water may differ noticeably from that over deep ocean, especially under strong wind conditions, and an inappropriate usage of marine roughness predictors may result in significant estimation errors.",,,,,,,,,7,0,0,0,0,0,7,,,1558-8424,1558-8432,,,,,,,,,,"City Univ Hong Kong, Dept Architecture & Civil Engn, Tat Chee Ave, Kowloon 999077, Hong Kong, Peoples R ChinaHong Kong Observ, Kowloon, Hong Kong, Peoples R China",Hong Kong Observ,,,2016-06-08,WOS:000376237100002,,

We tested the hypothesis that the interface of the coastal current and inshore waters can act as an ecological barrier to across-shelf transport of larvae but can be overcome by wind-or tidally-induced transport. Our study region in the Gulf of Maine encompasses a coastal current that diverges from the coast as it moves downshelf. The region inshore of this current is home to several species that exhibit limited recruitment in spite of extensive upshelf larval sources. Analysis of surface water temperatures and wind velocities revealed episodic decreases in temperature along the coast correlated with alongshelf (but not upwelling) winds, indicating wind-forced onshore movement of the cold coastal current. Such wind-driven onshore migrations are more common along the northern portion of the study region where the coastal current is near the coast, tidal currents are strong, and wind directions are more conducive to onshore migration, but rarer further south where the interface between inshore waters and the coastal current is further offshore and suitable wind events are less common. The distribution of bivalve larvae was consistent with the physical measurements. There was little across-shelf variation in larval abundance where the current abuts the coast, indicating strong across-shelf exchange of larvae, but strong across-shelf variation in larval density where the stratified inshore waters separate the current from the coast, indicating weak across-shelf transport of larvae.

Gas hydrates also constitute an attractive source of energy as they are estimated to contain very large reserves of methane. This paper presents a constitutive model to simulate the mechanical behaviour of methane hydrate-bearing soils based on the concept of an hierarchical single-surface (Hiss) framework. The core of the proposed model includes the Hiss critical-state framework, subloading concepts and hydrate enhancement factors.

Factors that influence oil spill consequences are myriad and range from the biophysical to the social. We provide a summary literature review and overview framework to help communities systematically consider the factors and linkages that would influence consequences of a potential oil spill. The focus is on spills from oil tanker accidents. Drawing primarily on empirical studies of previous oil spill disasters, we focused on several main domains of interest: the oil spill itself, disaster management, the physical marine environment, marine biology, human health, economy, and policy. Key variables that influence the severity of consequences are identified, and significant interactions between variables are delineated. The framework can be used to clarify the complexity of oil spill impacts, identify lessons that may be transferable from other oil spill disasters, develop scenarios for planning, and inform risk analysis and policy debates in localities that are seeking to understand and reduce their vulnerability to potential spill disasters. As a case study, the framework is used to consider potential oil spills and consequences in Vancouver, Canada. Major increases in oil tanker traffic are anticipated in this region, creating urgent new demands for risk information, disaster management planning, and policy responses. The case study identifies particular conditions that distinguish the Vancouver context from other historic events; in particular, proximity to a densely populated urban area, the type of oil being transported, financial compensation schemes, and local economic structure. Drawing lessons from other oil spill disasters is important but should be undertaken with recognition of these key differences.

As an attempt to refine he chronostratigraphy of the Pleistocene depositional systems, electron spin resonance (ESR) ages were obtained in 42 disarticulated shells of the marine bivalve Amiantis purpurata preserved in deposits in the southern CPRS, consisting of 35 specimens from five boreholes made during the construction of wind farms, plus another 7 shells from an irrigation channel. The shells were obtained from depths between 5.5 and 14 m, in two chronostratigraphically distinct depositional units (Barrier-Lagoon Systems II and III). Although the ages in each group of samples vary widely, the youngest age from the Barrier II (similar to 247 ka) is consistent with the timing of the transgression of the marine isotope stage (MIS) 7 inferred from other luminescence and ESR ages of sediments and shells. The ages obtained in shells from the Lagoon III deposits located landward of the Barrier III indicate deposition by the sea-level highstand of the substage MIS 5e, despite being older than the estimated age of similar to 120 ka of the latter. The younger shells from the seaward side of the Barrier III dated as of similar to 100 ka indicate deposits formed by the low-amplitude MIS 5c highstand, in agreement with luminescence ages of similar to 109, 104 and 101 ka obtained in outcrops on the shoreline. One shell dated as similar to 87 ka could indicate another highstand during MIS 5a. The presence of shells much older than the depositional systems indicate that marine deposits older than MIS 7 existed in the CPRS but were totally eroded by subsequent transgressions, and that shells can be preserved for periods of about 100-200 kyrs under certain conditions. Moreover, the ages younger than the highstand of MIS 5e on the seaward side of the Barrier III indicate that one (and possibly two) smaller amplitude highstands previously unrecognized in the CPRS left geological and fossil records in the study area.",,,,,,,,,11,0,0,0,3,1,11,,,0895-9811,1873-0647,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Fed Rio Grande do Sul, Inst Geociencias, Ave Bento Goncalves 9500, BR-91540000 Porto Alegre, RS, BrazilMuseu Coronel Tancredo Fernandes Mello, Rua Barao Rio Branco 467, BR-96230000 Santa Vitoria Do Palmar, RS, BrazilUniv Sagrado Coracao, PRPPG, Rua Irma Arminda 10-50,Campus Univ, BR-17011160 Bauru, SP, BrazilUniv Oeste Paulista, UNOESTE, PGMADRE, Rodovia Raposo Tavares,Km 572, BR-19067175 Presidente Prudente, SP, BrazilUniv Sao Paulo, Fac Ciencias Farmaceut Ribeirao Preto, USP, FCFRP, Ave Cafe S-N, Ribeirao Preto, SP, BrazilUniv Sao Paulo, Fac Filosofia Ciencias & Letras Ribeirao Preto, FFCLRP, USP, Ave Bandeirantes 3900, Ribeirao Preto, SP, Brazil",Museu Coronel Tancredo Fernandes Mello,,,2020-06-25,WOS:000539370500014,,

This Computational and Data-Enabled Science and Engineering (CDS&E) award would be used to develop a unified, data-driven framework and tools to advance the analysis and prediction of oceanic freak waves. The results of the research would provide key information for risk-based design of civil engineering and marine systems such as offshore platforms, wind turbines, and ships. The framework and tools would also benefit fundamental research on other complex systems that generate large amounts of data that must be processed-- ranging from manufacturing processes to disaster planning and response. The researchers' work on identifying signatures of rare events within big data sets could advance fundamental research in a variety of areas from medical diagnostics to airport security and the development of advanced materials. Collaborations with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and the US Navy will help to ensure that the work will be used to enhance weather forecasting and safety on the seas. The new framework is to be incorporated into a software package, which is used by NOAA, and is to be made available to researchers, students, and the public. Students will participate in the research and the results will be integrated into course materials and outreach activities for students in the University of Maryland, the US Naval Academy, and Women in Engineering. The researchers will also provide art-in-science displays on extreme wave phenomena for K-12 students. This research will be used to integrate statistical learning, signal processing, and Koopman operator theory to develop software tools and processes that can be configured to identify energy localizations across a variety of domains--including ocean waves-- to provide a prediction capability. As rare events, there are few measurements of rogue waves but there is a wealth of information on storms, other atmospheric events and wave behavior. An interdisciplinary team will integrate existing NOAA databases, General-Purpose Graphics Processing Units (GPGPU) computing, and the application of machine learning. The investigators will advance our understanding of how to use parallel processing of large-scale computations done by combining the processing power of GPUs and Central Processing Units (CPUs). This enhanced understanding will advance fundamental research in dynamical systems by enabling more effective use of a suite of simulation and signal processing tools, such as wavelets, Fast Fourier Transforms, and Monte Carlo simulations.

These showed that a structure only 0.3-mu m thick separated the capillary blood from the alveolar gas, immediately suggesting that the barrier might be vulnerable to mechanical failure if the capillary pressure increased. However, it was 38 years before stress failure was recognized. Initially it was implicated in the pathogenesis of High Altitude Pulmonary Edema, but it was soon clear that stress failure of pulmonary capillaries is common. The vulnerability of the blood-gas barrier is a key factor in the evolution of the pulmonary circulation. As evolution progressed from the ancestors of fishes to amphibians, reptiles, and finally birds and mammals, two factors challenged the integrity of the barrier. One was the requirement for the barrier to become increasingly thin because of the greater oxygen consumption. The other was the high pulmonary capillary pressures that were inevitable before there was complete separation of the pulmonary and systemic circulations.",,,,,,,,,21,0,0,0,14,1,25,,,0363-6119,,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Med, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA",,,,2013-03-06,WOS:000314643400001,23193116,

Determining the spatial distribution of gas hydrates at MVs is crucial to evaluate their sensitivity to known episodic changes in volcanic activity. We determined the hydrocarbon inventory and spatial distribution of hydrates at an individual MV structure. The Hakon Mosby Mud Volcano (HMMV), located at 1,250 m water depth on the Barents Sea slope, was investigated by combined pressure core sampling, heat flow measurements, and pore water chemical analysis. Quantitative pressure core degassing revealed gas-sediment ratios between 3.1 and 25.7, corresponding to hydrate concentrations of up to 21.3% of the pore volume. Hydrocarbon compositions and physicochemical conditions imply that gas hydrates incipiently crystallize as structure I hydrate, with a dissociation temperature of around 13.8°C at this water depth. Based on numerous in situ measurements of the geothermal gradient in the seabed, pore water sulfate profiles and microbathymetric data, we show that the thickness of the GHSZ increases from less than 1 m at the warm center to around 47 m in the outer parts of the HMMV. We estimate the total mass of hydrate-bound methane stored at the HMMV to be about 102.5 kt, of which 2.8 kt are located within the morphological Unit I around the center and thus are likely to be dissociated in the course of a large eruption.

The water masses of this brackish water body are usually strongly stratified, resulting in a layered system. The drifters were designed to follow the uppermost layer of the sea with a thickness of about 2 m. The drifter speed was 2.9-6.3% of the wind speed in 2011 when the drifters were more strongly impacted by the wind, and 1.9-2.9% in 2013 after the drifters had been modified to reduce the wind impact. The trajectories of drifters varied, in many instances the drift was almost aligned with the direction towards which the wind was blowing. In some cases the motion of drifters was systematically to the left of the wind vector apparently owing to boundary effects in the gulf. While on most occasions the drift was mostly along the gulf, on several occurrences rapid across-gulf transport was observed on time scales of 6-12 days. These observations suggest that the motions in the upper layer of the Gulf of Finland (and in similar environments) are intermittently driven by two drivers: the wind impact (including the accompanying Ekman drift) under moderate and strong winds and by underlying synoptic- and basin-scale circulation patterns in weak wind conditions.

The pathways of upward migration of gas can be reconstructed by considering the distribution of gas seeps with respect to the near-surface geomorphostructure and the regional stratigraphic architecture of the Marmara Basin. Gas seeps appear to be more favourably localized within a 1-2 km swath around active faults where sediment permeability is probably enhanced by deformation. In the fault zones, fault intersections between sets of transtensive and transpressive subsidiary faults, or between subsidiary faults and main faults, are the preferred gas pathways. These subsidiary structures localize methane seeps, observed as elongated black patches with bacterial mats, gas bubble emission sites, and chemoherms associated with buried mud volcanoes. Gas seeps are, however, rare along active faults segments crossing basin depocenters but focus along basin edges and along topographic highs. Considering the role of sedimentary layers as gas migration pathways can explain this characteristic of the distribution of gas seeps. Fault zones that cross updip gas migration pathways will vent comparatively more gas than fault zones on the downdip side. Moreover, gas accumulation and resulting overpressuring along the western fault segment crossing the Western High may be associated with aseismic fault creep and intense gas emissions at the seafloor. In contrast, the poorly focused seepage along the fault segment crossing the Central High may be linked to the locked state of this fault segment.",,,,,,,,,10,0,0,0,2,0,10,,,0967-0645,1879-0100,,,,,,,,,,"Columbia Univ, Lamont Doherty Earth Observ, Palisades, NY 10964 USAAix Marseille Univ, CNRS, IRD, INRA,Coll France,CEREGE, Aix En Provence, FranceIFREMER, Marine Geosci Unit, Plouzane, FranceATGEO, Aix En Provence, FranceIstanbul Tech Univ, Maden Fak, Jeol Bolumu, TR-34469 Istanbul, TurkeyDokuz Eylul Univ, Izmir, Turkey",ATGEO,,,2018-12-28,WOS:000449444700003,,

Test results showed that the soil pressure acting on the caisson's inner skirt was larger than the outer soil pressure during jacking installation; whilst the tip resistance was greater than skirt friction. Penetration resistance was well predicted with the jacked pile theory and cone resistance. Overturning failure of the foundation occurred under the lateral loading. Ultimate lateral loads displayed a descending trend with increasing loading position height, whereas the corresponding moments exhibited an increasing trend.

To improve gas recovery from existing and new fields at greater depths, the produced gas will be compressed, processed and transported via subsea templates and underwater networks (pipelines, flexible risers, etc.). Besides the huge consequences for the subsea installation itself (reliability, maintenance, etc.), it also has consequences for underwater wildlife through the underwater source vibrations leading to sound radiation. Regulations aimed at managing the impact of underwater sound on marine life have been put in place by different nations [e.g. 1,2]. Many offshore operations require an assessment of the potential impact of underwater noise on the environment, which requires knowledge of the sound transmitted by the subsea components.Until now very little is known about the underwater source mechanisms, the acoustic strength of these underwater networks, the coupling of the emitted source sound to the surrounding medium and the impact of the sound on the underwater wildlife. The dynamic behavior of networks for compressing and transporting gas, and the translation into emitted noise into air are rather well understood. However, due to the presence of the water the dynamic behavior from such subsea installation is very different than in air. To predict the dynamic behavior, the presence of the water cannot be neglected and has to be taken into account.This paper presents a simplified model for a subsea high speed turbo-compressor coupled to the KrakenC normal mode propagation model. With this combined model the noise at remote locations can be predicted and compared with the ambient noise and other anthropogenic noise sources such as for instance shipping, dredging and wind farm operation noise.",,,,,"33rd ASME International Conference on Ocean, Offshore and Arctic Engineering33rd ASME International Conference on Ocean, Offshore and Arctic Engineering","JUN 08-13, 2014JUN 08-13, 2014","ASME, Ocean, Offshore & Arct Engn DivASME, Ocean, Offshore & Arct Engn Div","San Francisco, CASan Francisco, CA",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,978-0-7918-4549-3,,,,,,,,,"TNO, Delft, NetherlandsTNO, The Hague, Netherlands",,,,2015-11-11,WOS:000363498400008,,

The 50% detection threshold sound exposure levels (SELs) for the first sound of the series (no masking) were 72 (100m) and 74 (800m) dB re 1 mu Pa(2)s. Multiple sounds in succession (series) caused a similar to 5 dB decrease in hearing threshold; the mean 50% detection threshold SELs for any sound in the series were 68 (100m) and 69 (800m) dB re 1 mu Pa(2)s.

Mild steel find its role in almost every product created from metal due to its low cost and easy availability. The polymeric materials are having multiple adsorption sites for bonding with metal surface and provides higher inhibition efficiency than the corresponding monomers. In the present work, the corrosion inhibition of mild steel in 3.5% NaCl by polyvinyl alcohol/TiO2 composites were studied. The composite samples were characterized by using XRD, FTIR and SEM.

The lengthy environmental compliance process, estimated to incur a 7-10 year permitting timeline [1], has been identified as a significant impediment to offshore energy development in U.S. waters. During operation, seabirds can collide and be displaced by turbines. During episodic pre-operation phases, cetaceans are most heavily impacted acoustically by pile driving (and similarly seismic air gun surveys for oil and gas exploration). The varying nature of impacts in space and time leads us to conclude that sites should be selected in space to minimize long-term operational impacts on seabirds, and timing of surveying and construction activities to be conducted in times of the year when sensitive migratory marine mammals are least present. We developed a novel spatiotemporal decision support framework that interactively visualizes tradeoffs between OWED industry profits and wildlife sensitivities, in both space and time. The framework highlights sites on a map that are the most profitable and least sensitive to seabirds. Within the U.S. Mid-Atlantic study area, the New York Call Areas are particularly well optimized for minimal impact on seabirds with maximal profits to OWED. For a given site, pre-operational activities (e.g. pile driving and seismic air gun surveying) are advised by cetacean sensitivity across months of the year that minimize impacts on migratory cetaceans, particularly those of highest conservation concern such as the North Atlantic right whale ( Eubalaena Glacialis ). For instance, within optimal sites for the New York Call Area the least impacting months are May and June. Other taxa are certainly affected by OWED and should be incorporated into this framework, but data on their distributions and/or sensitivities is currently less well known. Built with open-source software made publicly available, the authors hope this framework will be extended even more comprehensively into the future as our knowledge on species distributions and OWED sensitivities expands for streamlining environmental compliance.

The dispersion behavior of blowout gas with wind is predicted and the hazardous area generated on an offshore platform is assessed. Also, the effect of well productivity on the blowout gas dispersion is examined. Subsequently, the deflagration scenario due to ignition of flammable gas is simulated to predict the deflagration loads including overpressure, high temperature and heat radiation. Eventually, the impact of blowout gas deflagration on offshore platform and personnel is assessed. The hazardous area generated by blowout gas dispersion is mainly distributed on the drill floor. The increase of well productivity can cause an increase of the hazardous area. The minimum radius to ensure the safety under deflagration overpressure is 30.63 m.

It is shown that small off-grid communities can be supplied with stable year-round power by means of a small fleet of remotely controlled ships which operate in high-wind ocean areas. A preliminary cost analysis indicates that this energy ship concept is economically competitive with land-based wind hydrogen systems.

Concerns include animal collision with turbine blades, disruption of migratory and foraging behaviour, attraction of animals to prey aggregating around turbines, or conversely displacement of animals from preferred habitat.This study used concurrent ecological and physical measurements to show the predictability of fish school characteristics (presence, school area and height above seabed) in a high energy tidal site across spring/neap, ebb/flood and daily cycles, and how this changed around a turbine structure.The rate of schools and school area per hour increased by 1.74 and 1.75 times respectively around a turbine structure compared to observations under similar conditions without a turbine structure. The largest schools occurred at peak flow speeds and the vertical distribution of schools over the diel cycle was altered around the turbine structure.While predictable attraction or aggregation of prey may increase prey availability and predator foraging efficiency, attraction of predators has the potential to increase animal collision risk. Predictable changes from the installation of turbine structures can be used to estimate cumulative effects on predators at a population level.

During the last century, however, human activities were not always rational and sustainable. In this context, the energy and metal resources are characterised with a due consideration on the uneven distribution and dynamic increase of the Earth's human population, both resulting from interplay of natural and socioeconomic factors at a global scale. These two groups of resources are fundamental constituents for production of material and development of civilisations. Against the backdrop of the identified conflict areas between Man and Nature, a contention is put forth that sustained development in the 21st century depends on access to the resources of the world oceans.Oceanic resources are characterized against the background of the world's supply and demand of mineral resource. When analysing the varying rate at which the demand for resources has been increasing over the last fifty years, attention is being paid in numerous countries to the changes in spatial structure of resource exploitation, depletion of rich deposits, and a restricted access to resources as experienced. The most pronounced changes in the world-wide use of resources, including the fossil fuels and metal ores, have been taken place in the second half of the 20th century. The predicted increase in demand for raw materials as well as the limitations in access determine the changes in spatial structure of resource exploitation and trigger actions aimed at securing the access within the system of global integration. The existing, important restrictions in access to ocean resources are emphasized; those restrictions are related to expansion, on the part of numerous coastal states, of the outer border of the continental shelf up to 350 nautical miles off shore.Changes in the global structure of fossil fuel utilisation serve as a backdrop for discussing changes in the spatial structure of exploitation of oil, gas, and their primary global geological resources. The increasing importance of offshore deposits in the oil and gas exploitation is underlined. The primary importance of the Atlantic and Arctic seas in terms of their share of rich oil/gas-bearing basins is demonstrated. The promise offered by the oceanic gas hydrate deposits is emphasized as well.The potential for satisfying mankind's demand for metals in the 21st century has been evaluated, based on the so-called global metallogenic potential of the Earth, calculated for a certain period as a sum of the resources mined during historical time as well as the reliable and prognostic resources. The most recent data show that, until 1995, mankind had used up 20 - 70% of the metal deposits. The metal resources of Pb, Sri, Sb, Ag, An, Zn, Cu and Ni have been used most extensively, where as the lowest rate of use have been reported for the Fe, Mn, Cr, Co, and bauxite. It has been predicted that the demand for Zn will increase by the factor of 3.81; 3.42, 2.19, 1.86, 1.72, 1.45, 1.32, 1.14, and 1.15 are the increase factors of the demand for the Co, Ni, Cu, Sb, Sn, Pb, Mn, and An, respectively. In the 21st century, the oceanic deep sea polymetallic resources will be increasingly important in suppressing deficiency of such metals as Mn, Ni, Cu, Co, Mo, Pt, Ag, Bi, An, and REE.",,,,,4th ISOPE Ocean Mining Symposium4th ISOPE Ocean Mining Symposium,"SEP 23-27, 2001SEP 23-27, 2001",Int Soc Offshore & Polar Engineers; Interoceanmetal Joint OrgInt Soc Offshore & Polar Engineers; Interoceanmetal Joint Org,"Szezecin, POLANDSzezecin, POLAND",10,0,0,0,0,0,10,,,,,1-880653-56-7,,,,,,,,,"Tech Univ Szczecin, Interoceanmet Joint Org, PL-71065 Szczecin, Poland",,,,2001-01-01,WOS:000189499100001,,

Another hypothesis was that [O-3] declines from the coast towards inland.

The island experienced 10 % higher [O-3] compared to the coast. This difference was larger with offshore (15 %) than onshore wind (9 %). The concentration difference between island and coast was larger during night, but prevailed during day and could not be explained by differences in [NO2] between the sites.

The Florida Coastal Everglades Long Term Ecological Research (FCE-LTER) program in south Florida includes open water, seagrass and mangrove habitats that could receive oil. Mangrove forests and seagrass beds, and the faunal communities they support, are exceedingly sensitive to damage from oil spills. Oil is directly toxic to marine plants, and mangroves are sensitive to smothering and death when oil slicks wash ashore. The food webs of these coastal communities are highly sensitive to toxic compounds in oil, and impacted seagrass animal communities can be altered for many years after a spill. Given the susceptibility of the ecosystems of the FCE to oil spills, significant oil reaching this well-studied system could drastically alter the distribution of the marine communities, the structure of the food web, and the cycling of organic matter for years or decades after the spill. In this project, the investigators will measure hydrocarbon concentrations and food web structure at sites that may be directly impacted by the oil spill before the oil reaches them, and assess how these factors change following the arrival of oil. The researchers will test the hypotheses that 1) oil pollution shortens food chain length in coastal ecosystems, and 2) food web structure will be differentially affected in seagrass beds, where the primary producers are less sensitive to hydrocarbon pollution, compared to mangrove forests where the primary producers are killed by oil. The ecological disaster playing out in the Gulf of Mexico as a result of the Deepwater Horizon BP oil spill is underscoring the importance that a sustainable costal ecosystem has in supporting the social and economic integrity of the human population in the region. This work will improve future oil spill clean-up efforts by defining the effects of oil-derived compounds on the structure and function of the food webs that support the important economic and cultural infrastructure of the region. Further, the FCE is located within the boundaries of Everglades National Park, an important natural resource; this work will document the extent of impact on the greater Everglades ecosystem by the oil spill.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,1048458,,,,,,,,Florida International University,,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:13938020,,

Four high-resolution vertical profiles for gases (N2O and CH4) and nutrients (NO3- and PO43-) were measured using a Pumped Profiling System (PPS), connected with a liquid degassing membrane coupled with Cavity Ring-Down Spectroscopy (CRDS) and a nutrient auto-analyzer, respectively. The membrane-CRDS system maintains a linear response over a wide range of gas concentrations, detecting N2O and CH4 levels as low as 0.0774 +/- 0.0004 and 0.1011 +/- 0.001 ppm, respectively. Continuous profiles for gases and nutrients were similar to those reported throughout the ESP, with pronounced N2O and CH(4 )peaks at the upper oxycline and at the base of the euphotic zone and pycnocline, respectively, in the coastal zone; but almost constant depth profiles in the subtropical gyre.

A classification into three main groups is proposed on the basis of the morphology and nature of deposits: (1) mud volcanoes, (2) methane-derived authigenic carbonates (MDAC) mounds, and (3) crater-like pockmarks. Mud volcanoes are, topographically, cone-shaped sea-floor edifices, built up from catastrophic mud and fluid degassing, intercalated with periods of inactivity. So far more than 25 mud volcanoes have been discovered in the Gulf of Cadiz, named in memory of deceased colleagues (e.g., Ginsburg and Baraza), or researchers' birth places (e.g. Faro, Cibeles, Almazan, San Petersburgh, Yuma, Rabat, Bonjardim, Coruna, Gades). These structures range from 800 to 2500 m in diameter and tower 150-300 m above the seabed. The volcanoes consistently feature a well-defined outer ring or circular terrace and an inter dome. All mud volcanoes are built up of episodes of mud-breccia flows, intercalated with deep-current deposits, with evident indications of gas saturation: degassing structures, a strong H2S smell, and chemosynthetic fauna (such as Pogonophora sp. tube worms and Calyptogena sp.). Commonly observed carbonate crusts and slabs overlying some mud volcanoes are thought to have been formed by slow, diffuse venting during periods of inactivity or slower rates of fluid venting following the ejection of mud. A fermentation process, the result of microbial-mediated oxidation of hydrocarbon-enriched fluids, seems to play an important role in the growth of large deep-water carbonate mounds and chimneys during periods of low methane-seep fluid pressure. More than 400 crater-like pockmarks, a common sea-floor feature in the TASYO field, have been observed. Their seabed diameter ranges from 500 to 3000 m, with steep slopes ranging from 12 degrees to 35 degrees. According to their internal structure, pockmarks can be grouped into: (1) pockmarks with low central mounds and (2) crater-like pockmarks, apparently collapse structures lacking central mounds, with a flat to slightly undulating sea bottom surrounded by steep slopes (up to 25 degrees).

The results show high spatial variation of Chl-a concentrations in the SCS and revealed an anomalous event in 1998. High Chl-a concentrations in the southwestern SCS in the summer season ( June to August) may be related with strong Ekman Pumping and strong wind stress, whereas a jet-shape high Chl-a region offshore in western SCS was associated with coastal upwelling driven by offshore Ekman transport and Vietnamese offshore current. Chl-a concentrations in 1998 summer in the SCS were the lowest among the 7 years and were particularly low in the western SCS. At the same season, the jet-shape Chl-a region offshore of southeast Vietnam almost disappeared, and southwesterly monsoon winds and offshore current were relatively weaker in 1998.

An offshore triangular phytoplankton bloom (chlorophyll a (Chl a) > 0.5 mg m(-3)) was observed near Dongsha Archipelago along Nuri's track, prolongating southeastward to 18 degrees N 1 week after the typhoon's passage; a stronger nearshore phytoplankton increase (Chl a > 1.5 mg m(-3)) with high total suspended sediment appeared southwest of the PRE from the coast toward the South China Sea. After the typhoon's passage, sea surface cooling (similar to 3 degrees C), strong wind (> 20 m s(-1)), and heavy rainfall (> 100 mm d(-1)) were also observed in the region, especially offshore. In addition, the freshwater discharge from the PRE during the typhoon passage increased fivefold in comparison with the August climatology in the nearshore bloom region. The nearshore bloom was probably due to the increased discharge from the PRE and favorable current, as well as mixing, upwelling, and near-inertial resonance driven by strong typhoon wind. The offshore bloom may be triggered by upwelling and entrainment induced by strong typhoon wind and the topography of islands and islets.

A transect of sediment surface pollen samples retrieved from the Namaqualand mudbelt from just south of the Orange River mouth (29 degrees S) to St Helena Bay (33 degrees S) indicates distinctive pollen spectra reflecting vegetation communities on the adjacent continent. Pollen concentration increases southwards, partly in relation to greater pollen productivity due to higher biomass and density of fynbos vegetation and of sedimentary processes and low pollen concentrations consequent to dilution with silt and clay from the Orange River. The distribution of specific pollen taxa suggests that the Orange River is a major contributor of pollen to the northern mudbelt declining southwards, while the pollen distribution in the central mudbelt is largely attributable to seasonal inputs of pollen from offshore berg winds and local ephemeral Namaqualand rivers. The typical fynbos elements dominate in the southern mudbelt indicating a pollen source mainly in the fynbos vegetation types. These conclusions support a companion analysis of fossil pollen records of two marine sediment cores from the northern and southern mudbelt respectively. This study demonstrates that pollen records from marine sediment cores in the Namaqualand mudbelt have the potential to be a tool to reconstruct palaeovegetation on the adjacent continent. However, to better reconstruct the palaeoclimate of South Africa and fully understand the relations between terrestrial and marine deposits, more marine surface sediments along the western coast of South Africa as well as more terrestrial surface sediments need to be studied.

Most mariculture organisms are produced in coastal areas, where space is scarce and user conflicts exist. For extensive cultures farming off the coast at offshore sites could be a solution to eliminate these problems and facilitate further expansion of environmentally sustainable aquaculture. The aim of this study was to examine the biological adequacy of two candidate species for ostreiculture, the Pacific oyster Crassostrea gigas and the European flat oyster Ostrea edulis. Growth rates, condition and mortality in offshore environments were investigated by transferring oyster spat of both species to 4 different sites in 2004 and 2007. Samples were taken every six to eight weeks from April to October and length, width, height and dry mass were measured as well as the Condition Index (CI = dry mass meat-100/ft mass shell) was calculated. Results show that both oyster species grow successfully in a high-energy environment. Mean growth rates are similar to those measured in individuals from coastal habitats (wild banks and cultures) and the CI shows seasonal variation in both species. The survival rate for both species was > 99% in 2007. However, in the previous trial in 2004 a high mortality rate was observed for O. edulis at one single site at the end of the experiment. Differences were observed in the increase of shell length and dry mass between sites and size classes. Taking these results into account site-selection criteria for different offshore locations are presented. We conclude that offshore cultivation of oysters will be successful if site-selection criteria are examined carefully when choosing a location for offshore aquaculture. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

The model simulations are run on two high-resolution unstructured grids, one for the pre-breach configuration, one including the new inlet, with tidal-only forcing, and summer and winter forcing conditions. Despite its small cross-sectional size, the breach has a relatively large net inflow that leads to a strengthening of the along-bay through-flow in Great South Bay (GSB); the tidally driven volume transport in central GSB quadrupled. The seasonal forcing scenarios show that the southwesterly sea breeze in summer slowsdown the tidally driven flow, while the forcing conditions in winter are highly variable, and the circulation is dependent on wind direction and offshore sea level. Changes in flushing and exposure time associated with the modified transport patterns are evaluated using a Eulerian passive tracer technique.

Acoustic properties, like detection thresholds of these instruments, are essential for interpretation of results, but have nevertheless received little attention. A methodology for calibrating tonal click detectors in small tanks consisting of the determination of the horizontal directivity pattern and detection thresholds including a transfer function is presented. Two approaches were tested to determine detection thresholds by (a) determining the 50% detection threshold and (b) fitting a linear regression model to the recorded relative amplitudes. The tests were carried out on C-PODs (Cetacean PODs, tonal click detectors), the most commonly used instrument for SAM in Europe. Directivity and threshold were tested between 60 and 150 kHz. Directivity showed a maximum variation of 8.5 dB in the horizontal plane. Sensitivity is highest between 80 and 130 kHz and linear (+/-3 dB) in this frequency range for most of the instruments tested.

Ash contains chemical elements and materials that can encourage the growth of microscopic organisms in the surface ocean. The Thomas Fire has burned over 240,000 acres in southern California since Dec 4, 2017. The winds have carried a plume of smoke, ash and soot more than 1000 km over the Santa Barbara Channel. The intellectual merit of this RAPID project focuses on the impact of fire ash supply to coastal ocean ecosystems, by studying the 2017 Thomas Fire. This is achieved through a combination of experiments and environmental measurements, including an oceanographic expedition to the affected area aboard the R/V Sally Ride. The broader impacts of this award include the shipboard training of more than twelve graduate students as well as providing insight as to effects of the Thomas Fire on the coastal ocean. Massive wildfires can couple terrestrial ecosystems to coastal ocean ecosystems through depositional and runoff processes. The Thomas Fire, which began on Dec 4, 2017, has burned over 240,000 acres and the persistent offshore winds created a plume of smoke, ash and soot that extended over 1000 km off shore. This unfortunate circumstance provides an opportunity to investigate the impact of ash deposition on the coastal ocean. This research entails a series of incubation experiments and measurements designed to assess the impact of fire ash deposition on the biogeochemistry of the coastal ocean. Specifically, the research tests the hypothesis that the deposition of wildfire-derived particulate matter to the coastal ocean impacts the planktonic communities of the upper water column, providing nutrients that facilitate blooms of phytoplankton, leaching dissolved organic carbon to surface waters that feeds heterotrophic bacterial populations, and serving as a source of sinking particulate matter that feeds heterotrophic bacterial populations deeper in the water column. These hypotheses are tested through a series of experiments at sea and in the home laboratories, and through shipboard measurements and analysis of samples collected from impacted waters.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,1821916,,,,,,,,University of California-Santa Barbara,,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:14027743,,

For this, data from QuikSCAT (swath data from L2B 25 km and L2B 12.5 km slice composites, together with gridded L3) and CCMP were compared with measurements taken from five buoys located along the Iberian Peninsula coast.The results presented in this work show that QuikSCAT products have their strength in representing the temporal variability of the wind speed (higher correlation coefficients and lower RMSE and STDE) and the mean state of the wind direction (lower biases). Although no major differences were detected among QuikSCAT products, the high-resolution database (12.5 km) was the one with the best overall scores. However, CCMP is able to bring significant improvements in terms of wind direction temporal variability and wind speed mean state. CCMP also showed its capability to partially mitigate some of QuikSCAT's known problems, mainly those related to QuikSCAT systematic tendency to overestimate the wind speed and land masking effects. In addition, CCMP consists in a gridded dataset with a higher temporal sampling and complete data availability when compared to QuikSCAT, allowing this database to be clearly the one with a better ability to characterize the wind regimes measured by the buoys in terms of wind speed frequency distributions.These features can render CCMP an interesting ocean wind database for offshore wind energy assessment studies, where wind speed mean state accuracy plays the key role, and also for meteorological, oceanic and climate modelling applications where gridded wind data with good temporal sampling and data availability is vital to force numerical simulation models.

In all, 17 species are dealt with. Fourteen of these are truly Nearctic with normal distributions ranging from western Greenland to Florida, and there were no less than 32 records (involving some 36 individuals) in this category. The other 3 species are Holarctic and 50-odd records involving about 110 individuals are included because some of the observations clearly refer to birds from Greenland or arctic Canada. The most frequent pressure-pattern which gave rise to Atlantic crossings by American waders (particularly Pectoral and White-rumped Sandpipers), and also Grey Phalaropes and Sabine s Gulls, showed a cyclonic NW wind over Labrador and Davis Strait, occasionally extending to west Greenland, backing westerly in mid-Atlantic on the periphery of vigorous depressions in neighborhood of Denmark Strait. A few depressions reaching the North Atlantic storm-track came down from the Hudson's Bay region of Arctic Canada, sweeping across St. Lawrence waterway and Newfoundland to pursue a NE course. Offshore westerly winds and poor visibility at the fronts, causing drift, are associated with these depressions. Other depressions, sometimes at hurricane intensity in their early stages, take a similar path into the Atlantic after traveling NE along the eastern coast of the U. S. from as far south as Florida. In such cases, birds are often displaced northwards to reach New England and Nova Scotia as vagrants, and there is a risk of drift out to sea. Appearance of 2 Passerines (Northern Water thrush and Baltimore Oriole) in SW England followed this pattern, also the occurrence in the Isles of Scilly of an American Purple Gallinule. A down-wind directed flight is strongly indicated in the sometimes very local grouping of arrivals, the fall being confined to that part of the country which is exposed to the westerly airstream. || ABSTRACT AUTHORS: D.

Long-term measured data of solar radiation, wind energy, ocean waves and rainfall have been used for this project. The assessment criteria for this project were to estimate the availability of renewables that could be harnessed. Despite the large potential for the development of renewables in Brunei Darussalam their exploitation remains insignificant. This study utilized renewable energy supply (RES) assessment software, HOMER (National Renewable Energy Laboratory, US) to compute the utilization of solar thermal energy for domestic and industrial water heating. The modelling results demonstrated that solar thermal energy can adequately and reliably meet the power demand for water heating in domestic as well as industrial applications and it can reduce by substantial amount of the non-renewable of energy consumption used for such applications. Monthly-mean-yearly-averaged amount of global, diffused and direct solar radiation are 18.90, 9.20 and 9.69 MJ m(-2), respectively. The theoretical possible annual potential of wave, tidal and offshore wind power is 0.66 GW, 335 kW and 372 MW, respectively.

Surface soil samples and river sediment samples near the oilfield were collected and analyzed for the total petroleum hydrocarbons (TPHs), n-alkanes, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), bacterial biodiversity, and environmental factors. Petroleum fingerprinting analysis and redundancy analysis (RDA) were then conducted to evaluate the petroleum contamination and the bacterial community structure. The results of these studies showed that the petroleum contamination in the study area was high in TPHs, present at the levels in the ranges 1678-6748, 1189-2237, and 1089-1728 mg/kg in the wastelands, sediments, and farmlands, respectively. Chemical fingerprint indicators (e.g., carbon preference index near 1 and pristane/phytane < 10) indicate that petroleum pollution in the wasteland near the oil wells migrated to the farmlands and rivers, and deep biodegradation occurred in these places. The microbial diversity analysis identified many genus, including Stenotrophomonas, Arenimonas, Sphingomonas, Aquabacterium, Acinetobacter, Comamonas and Pseudomonas, containing many known petroleum degrading species.

It has direct applications such as wind farm prospective location or long-term power generation prediction in wind-based energy facilities. The problem's objective is to select the best set of N measuring points (i.e. N representative points), in such a way that a wind power error reconstruction measure is minimized, considering a monthly average wind power field. In order to solve this problem, we use a novel meta-heuristic algorithm, the Coral Reefs Optimization with Substrate Layer, which is an evolutionary-type method able to combine different search procedures within a single population. The CRO-SL is hybridized with the Analogue Method as wind power reconstruction method, to identify the most representative points for the wind field. The proposed approach has been tested in the reconstruction of monthly average wind power fields in Europe, from reanalysis data (ERA-Interim reanalysis). The method exhibits strong performance as evidenced from the experiments carried out. The solutions obtained show that the more significant measuring points are mainly located over the Atlantic ocean, which is consistent with the wind speed climatology of the Northern hemisphere mid-latitudes. We have also analyzed the set of least representative points to reconstruct the wind power field (less informative points for whole reconstruction of the field), obtaining points mainly located at the North of Scandinavia (which may be associated with the circumpolar circulation), and some points in the Eastern Mediterranean, which seem to be related to the Etesian winds. Reconstructions at seasonal scales show similar results, which provides confidence on the robustness of the proposed method.

According to this scheme, the species and quantitative structure of the phytoplankton community depend on the intensity of mixing of the water column (in this case, the convective mixing). The strengthening of convective mixing results from the advection of the deep waters from the open sea regions due to winter offshore winds; this strengthening results in the blooming of small centric diatoms (coldwater species of genera Chaetoceros and Thalassiosira nordenskioeldii Cleve). Under the ice cover, this blooming occurs at a temperature from -1.4 to -1.5 degrees C, while without ice cover the blooming temperature is -1.7 degrees C. In the absence of advection of the deep waters and the resulting decrease of the intensity of convective mixing (homothermal conditions with a temperature of -1.9 degrees C), no winter blooming of phytoplankton was observed either in open water or under ice cover.

Given that compensation is a desired policy at a given site, this study suggests an interdisciplinary scaling method (Resource Equivalency Analysis) that relies on a nonmonetary bird-year metric to quantify and value the impact on human welfare from ecosystem service loss. The lost value associated with white-tailed eagle (Haliaeetus albicilla) turbine collisions at the Smola windpower plant (debit) in central Norway is compensated through white-tailed eagle electrocution-prevention measures at nearby power lines (credit), scaled using the same bird-year metric. We found that 172 actual and projected white-tailed eagle turbine collisions (2005-2027) led to a debit of 3,454 discounted bird-years, which captures lost life expectancy discounted to present value. Field searches indicated that annual white-tailed eagle electrocution mortality per electric distribution pole (or pylon) at Smola ranges from 0.002 to 0.014 (2009-2011). We suggest that retrofitting between 348 and 2,209 pylons at a present-value cost of US$1.2-7.9 million (2011 at 3%) will provide equivalent value and thus compensate the public for their welfare losses. Improved electrocution probability models will improve cost-effectiveness of retrofitting as a compensatory measure. Although Resource Equivalency Analysis may provide an approach for scaling a biodiversity offset, it cannot address the inevitable environmental trade-offs required in assessing the social profitability of choosing to compensate at a particular site.

This has been documented in three regions that share a common feature, namely a wide and shallow continental shelf. This upwelling feature plays a key role in the ecology of the Canary Current System. It creates an innerfront which provides retention for biological material, e.g. fish eggs and larvae, in the highly productive nearshore environment.An analytical model has been developed based on a two dimensional extension of Ekman's Solution. The linear and steady response of a homogeneous Ocean forced by an upwelling-favorable wind provides a mechanism for the upwelling separation from the coast. The merging of the Surface and bottom Ekman layers induces a very weak cross-shore circulation and a kinematic barrier for the Ekman transport divergence. In the case of an alongshore wind, the barrier is located near the isobath h approximate to 0.4D, where D is the thickness of Ekman layers. This yields 1111 upwelling cell which is essentially concentrated in the region 0.5D < h < 1.25D, with upwelling occurring preferentially near the isobath h approximate to 0.6D. It turns out that the cross-shore width of upwelling scales with D/S, the ratio of Ekman depth to bottom topographic slope. The application of this solution to real bathymetric profiles rationalizes, not only the offshore upwelling observations in Northwest Africa, but also the influence of topography oil file cross-shelf structure of a wind-driven coastal upwelling. The model also quantifies the effect of the cross-shore wind component showing how it drives the nearshore pressure gradient adjustment and how it affects the upwelling. A linear numerical experiment reproduces the theoretical steady solution, thereby allowing investigation of the transient regime. Relaxation of the hypothesis in the numerical model validates the linear assumption of the theory and then allows investigation of the sensitivity to friction parameterizations and the influence of stratification. The latter leads to an oscillation of the upwelling cell with seaward migration driven by outcropping and homogeneization of the water column. and, coastal incursion driven by a boundary layers splitting process caused by shoreward advection of the isopycnal dome and stratification of the inner shelf.",,,,,,,,,79,0,0,0,15,0,85,,,0022-2402,1543-9542,,,,,,,,,,"Univ New S Wales, Sydney, NSW, AustraliaInst Rech Dev, Noumea, New CaledoniaLab Phys Oceans, Brest, FranceInst Rech Dev, Brest, France",,,,2008-09-01,WOS:000264120700002,,

Samples of both mats showed efficient degradation of crude oil in the light, followed by development of an intense bloom of Phormidium spp. and Oscillatoria spp. Isolated cyanobacterial strains, however, did not degrade crude oil in axenic cultures. Strains of sulfate-reducing bacteria and aerobic heterotrophs were capable of degrading model compounds of aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbons. Results indicate that degradation of oil was done primarily by aerobic heterotrophic bacteria. The oxygenic photosynthesis of oil-insensitive cyanobacteria supplied the molecular oxygen for the efficient aerobic metabolism of organisms, such as Marinobacter sp. The diurnal shifts in environmental conditions at the mat surface, from highly oxic conditions in the light to anaerobic sulfide-rich habitat in the dark, may allow the combined aerobic and anaerobic degradation of crude oil at the mat surface. Hence, coastal cyanobacterial mats may be used for the degradation of coastline oil spills. Oxygen microelectrodes detected a significant inhibition of photosynthetic activity subsequent to oil addition. This prevailed for a few hours and then rapidly recovered. In addition, shifts in bacterial community structure following exposure to oil were determined by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis of PCR-amplified fractions of 16S rRNA from eubacteria, cyanobacteria and sulfate-reducing bacteria. Since the mats used for the present study were obtained from oil-contaminated environments, they were believed to be preequilibrated for petroleum remediation.

J,"Carter, Caroline",,,,,,,,,,Understanding the potential for marine megafauna entanglement risk from marine renewable energy developments.,,,,,,,,Scottish Natural Heritage Commissioned Report,,,,791,,,,i,"ii, 1-87",,,,,,,,,,,Article,2014,2014,"Background The global marine renewable energy (MRE) industry (including offshore wind, wave and tidal energy) is developing rapidly, particularly in Scotland where the Scottish Government is driving growth of the industry as part of their sustainable development agenda. As increasing numbers of devices are set to be deployed, concerns have been raised over potential environmental impacts. One such potential impact of marine renewable energy development is the risk of whales, basking sharks and other large animals (marine megafauna) becoming entangled in mooring systems and associated power cables. Given the widespread occurrence of marine megafauna injury and mortality through entanglement and bycatch in fishing gear, the issue poses potentially serious conservation concerns. Main findings The present report set out to review existing information on entanglement risks to marine megafauna posed by moorings. Based on an extensive literature review, it was concluded that moorings such as those proposed for MRE devices will likely pose a relatively modest risk in terms of entanglement for most marine megafauna, particularly when compared to risk posed by fisheries. Nevertheless, some circumstances were identified where moorings associated with MRE devices could potentially pose a risk, particularly, 1) in cases involving large baleen whales and, 2) if derelict fishing gears become attached to the mooring, thereby posing an entanglement risk for a wide range of species (including fish and diving seabirds). In the absence of significant amounts of empirical data, a qualitative risk assessment approach was developed to assess relative risks to marine megafauna groups on the basis of biological and physical risk parameters. Biological risk factors included body size, animals' ability to detect moorings, animals' body flexibility and general feeding modes. Physical risk factors were defined as mooring tension characteristics, swept volume and curvature. Mooring behaviours were dynamically modelled for six different mooring types (catenary (three different compositions), catenary with accessory buoy, taut, taut with accessory buoy) using OrcaFlex(TM) software to assess the physical risk factors under different sea states. In order to inform the risk assessment, biological and physical risk factors were combined to populate a relative risk matrix for all modelled moorings. Results suggest that for most megafauna, MRE device moorings are unlikely to pose a major threat; however, it should be remembered that cetaceans (as European Protected Species) and basking sharks are afforded legal protection at the individual level in Scotland and therefore should be considered accordingly. Baleen whales were considered to be at greatest relative risk overall, largely due to their size and foraging habits. Some mooring designs presented a greater relative risk than others, with the greater relative risks generated by catenary moorings, particularly those containing nylon. Taut systems represented the lowest relative risk. Most moorings associated with MRE devices would likely be too strong for animals to easily break free if they became entangled. Entanglement risks among MRE arrays will likely vary substantially based on device spacing, mooring design and array layout. Currently MRE development proposals often vary in the degree of detail provided about the moorings' physical properties, complicating attempts by regulators to assess different mooring systems for entanglement risk. The qualitative risk assessment approach described in this report enables device developers and regulatory bodies to assess potential entanglement risks at an early stage of the development of a MRE proposal, allowing appropriate risk management and enabling mitigation strategies to be developed if necessary. Recommendations include the following: -When submitting a development proposal, developers should be encouraged to follow the relative risk assessment process outlined in this report, and to provide details of existing and planned routine inspection regimes involving moorings. -During the consent period of devices and arrays, a procedure needs to be put in place which would require developers to report to regulators any significant changes to mooring and MRE device behaviour over time if such changes would increase the risk of marine megafauna entanglement. -There is a need for the establishment of an official reporting mechanism by which developers can report the presence of marine megafauna entanglement in MRE device moorings to the regulator (e.g. Marine Scotland who will need to be aware for HRA and EPS purposes). -A formal accident investigation procedure needs to be put in place by the developer, in order that in the event of an entanglement the appropriate authorities are alerted to allow all relevant information to be recorded, and to trigger an assessment by the regulator into whether any emergency measures were required. -Details of moorings relevant to the risk of entanglement of marine megafauna should be included alongside Marine Licence applications and within Environmental Statements. -Further investigations are needed to clarify the distribution and abundance of derelict fishing gear in Scottish waters, and the extent to which gear becomes snagged in moorings or other vertical structures in the water column. -Further research may be required to assess the full range of entanglement mitigation options available to the MRE industry, to minimise any risks of entanglement events occurring. -Further research may be required to assess the effects of redistribution of fishing effort displaced from MRE development sites, to ensure that marine megafauna entanglement/bycatch risks are not merely displaced or exacerbated elsewhere as a result.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,1759-4014,,,,,,,,,,,"Scottish Nat Heritage, Redgorton, Perth, PH1 3EW, United Kingdom",,,,2014-01-01,ZOOREC:ZOOR15412081167,,

To estimate the distance at which two AMDs designed as 'seal scarers' (Ace Aquatec and Lofitech) are detected by harbor porpoises, the 50% hearing detection thresholds for playbacks of recordings of the AMD sounds were assessed. Both became audible at a received broadband sound pressure level (SPL) of 55 dB re 1 mu Pa. The effect of the AMDs on porpoise behavior was quantified at three SPLs determined during a pre-test: one which just did not cause a behavioral change, one which caused a small change in surfacing and swimming pattern, and one which caused the harbor porpoise to swim away from the transducers. The corresponding mean received SPLs in the pool were respectively: Ace Aquatec: 77, 117, and 139 dB re 1 mu Pa; and: Lofitech: 91, 121, and 151 dB re 1 mu Pa. As the mean received SPL increased, greater displacement occurred, and higher numbers of surfacings and increased swimming speed occurred in test periods than in associated baseline periods.

This experiment was designed to estimate the suitability of an original cellular biomarker to early quantify the biological risk associated to hydrocarbons pollutants in seawater. Oocytes and hepatopancreas cells, isolated from oyster (Crassostrea gigas), were tested for their capacity to regulate their volume following a hypo-osmotic challenge. Cell volumes were estimated from cell images recorded at regular time intervals during a 90 min-period. When exposed to diluted seawater (osmolalities from 895 to 712 mosm kg(-1)), both cell types first swell and then undergo a shrinkage known as Regulatory Volume Decrease (RVD). This process is inversely proportional to the magnitude of the osmotic shock and is best fitted using a first-order exponential decay model. The Recovered Volume Factor (RVF) calculated from this model appears to be an accurate tool to compare cells responses. As shown by an about 50% decrease in RVF, the RVD process was significantly inhibited in cells sampled from oysters previously exposed to a low concentration of diesel oil (8.4 mg L-1 during 24 h). This toxic effect was interpreted as a decreased permeability of the cell membranes resulting from an alteration of their lipidic structure by diesel oil compounds. In contrast, the previous contact of oysters with diesel did not induce any rise in the gills glutathione S-transferase specific activity. Therefore, this work demonstrates that the study of the RVD process of cells selected from sentinel animal species could be an alternative bioassay for the monitoring of hydrocarbons and probably, of various chemicals in the environment liable to alter the cellular regulations. Especially, given the high sensitivity of this biomarker compared with a proven one, it could become a relevant and accurate tool to estimate the biological hazards of micropollutants in the water.

Despite being one of the oldest renewable energy sources exploited by man, the technology is still in its pre-commercialisation stage and so lags behind other renewable sources such as wind and geothermal energy in terms of development and energy produced. One of the emerging energy extraction technologies in the tidal energy field is the Horizontal Axis Hydrokinetic Turbine (HAHT) which harness tidal stream energy the same way Horizontal Axis Wind Turbine (HAWT) extract energy from the wind. While HAHT has been the topic of many researches over the past decade, design of hydrofoils plays a vital role in increasing the structural strength of the blade and maximizing the output of the marine current turbines. In this context, a numerical investigation is conducted in this research in which new hydrofoil for marine current turbines underwater conditions was designed and evaluated. The turbine blade is designed using XFLR5 code and QBlade which is a Blade-Element Momentum solver with a blade design feature. Then, the hydrodynamic performance of hydrofoil was tested using Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) consisting of lift and drag coefficients, and velocities distribution. The results showed that the new design of the hydrofoil of marine current turbine blade maintained a C-Power value of 50% more from normal range at the TSR 5 to 9 and 51% more at TSR = 6,5 in the performance curve.

This paper describes a preliminary study about the energy production management of a simulated wave energy converter (WEC) farm based on point absorbers that could be installed in the vicinity of the SEM-REV site, i.e. the French multi-technology open sea test site. The proposed approach is based on the temporal analysis of the electrothermal behavior of the export cable of the SEM-REV. The models developed under Matlab-Simulink (R), are generic and can be easily extended to other WEC types and more sophisticated models and control strategies, as well as to other energy sources (e.g. offshore wind).

The overview of scientific literature sources summarizing the results of marine expeditions as well as the analysis of publications of world scientific community dealing with the studies of gas hydrates has made it possible to determine that gas hydrate deposits are associated to the zones of jointing of continental plates and oceanic troughs. In their turn, those zones, due to different genesis, are made up of the corresponding various products of sedimentary rock accumulations.

Firstly, the Longmaxi and Niutitang marine shales were found to be in an over-matured stage and dry gas window. Pore structures and connectivity were characterized by field emission - scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM). The SEM images showed that the micro-fracture, interparticle pores, and organic pores had better connectivity than intraparticle pores. Results from contact angles indicated that the Longmaxi and Niutitang shales tended to have higher affinities for oil rather than for water. The connectivity of pores, distribution of fluids (water and gas) and fluid flow behaviors in the over-matured shale were analyzed using spontaneous imbibition (SI) and tracer diffusion tests. It was found the tracer fluids flow in the way of network flow inside of shale matrix. The connected pore network may be the main path for fluid migration in shale. Additionally, a gravimetric isothermal adsorption experiment was applied to assess methane adsorption capacity in shale. Shale samples with higher total organic carbon (TOC) contents had higher methane adsorption capacities. Organic matter (including kerogen and bitumen), had much greater adsorption capabilities than inorganic minerals (quartz, clay, and others). Finally, the fluid distribution patterns in over-matured marine shale were studied. Shale gas was originally generated in organic matter and then migrated out through connected pores, under differential pressure, between internal and external organic matter hydrocarbon generation areas. These hydrocarbons replaced the water in the pores. Therefore, shale gas may adsorb in organic pores and is freely stored in connected inorganic pores, with bound water, whereas isolated pores are saturated with water. Two different adsorption patterns on mineral surfaces (organic matters and inorganic minerals) were established to explain the different shale gas adsorption behaviors in organic pores and connected pores, with bound water.",,,,,,,,,20,3,0,0,1,0,22,,,0264-8172,1873-4073,,,,,,,,,,"Chengdu Univ Technol, State Key Lab Oil & Gas Reservoir Geol & Exploita, Chengdu 610059, Sichuan, Peoples R ChinaUniv Texas Arlington, Dept Earth & Environm Sci, 500 Yates St, Arlington, TX 76019 USAChina Geol Survey, China Oil & Gas Survey Ctr, Beijing 100029, Peoples R China",,,,2019-10-25,WOS:000490044500014,,

Local observations from the communities of Gambell, Shaktoolik, Shishmaref, and Wales were synthesized to develop a taxonomy of slush-ice berm types and a conceptual process model that describes how they form and decay. Results indicated two types of slush-ice berm formation processes: in situ (forming in place) and advective (pushed in by storm winds). Several formation mechanisms were noted for the crystals that compose in situ berms. Cold air temperatures cool the surface of the water, and winds that translate surface cooling through a greater depth aid crystal formation. Snow landing in the water cools via melting of the snow and by contributing crystals directly to the water. A negative surge can expose the wet beach to cold air, allowing crystals to form on the beach, which are then picked up by waves. Slush crystals for advective berm events form offshore.

One or more SAR scenes are then selected to represent each wind class and the classes are weighted according to their frequency of occurrence. The wind class methodology was originally developed for mesoscale modeling of wind resources. Its performance in connection with sampling of SAR scenes is tested against two sets of random SA R samples and meteorological observations at three sites in the North Sea during 2005-08. Predictions of the mean wind speed and the Weibull scale parameter are within 5% from the mast observations whereas the deviation on power density and the Weibull shape parameter is up to 7%. These results are promising and may be improved further through a better population of the wind classes.

This study investigates the pore architecture of a sandstone sample from Collyhurst Sandstone Formation, northern England, a tight gas reservoir. X-ray Computed Tomography (XCT) was employed to quantify the pore system (pore size, shape, geometry, and connectivity). Three types of pores were identified: inter-grain pores which are at the boundary of detrital grains and/or authigenic minerals, intra-grains pores which are pores within the detrital mineral grains, and intra-cement pores which are pores within the cement phase (authigenic minerals). The first pore type is primary in origin, whereas the latter two are secondary pores. A centerline tree and a pore network model (PNM) algorithm were applied for pore network analysis and a porosity value was estimated. The image-based porosity value was validated with laboratory experimental measurement 3D image estimates 3.1% volume porosity, while 4.6% was recorded from the laboratory experiment.

Where in the past it has been found at public consultation stage that this can lead to discord, the DEP has sought to harmonise the process by adopting a more integrated approach to link stakeholder interest to a more informed understanding of estuary systems and how they are likely to change in the futureIn 2015, the DEP published an estuary plan that was both endorsed by the Environment Agency and adopted by the local planning authority. Now however, due to a change in local government there is a need to review and revise this document to align with a new Local Plan. It is coincidental that many of the actions proposed in the existing management plan have come to pass, including extensive improvement to the capability of the flood defences and an enhanced appreciation of the value of saltmarsh.In the interim so much has changed: climate change continues to drive sea level rise, putting pressure upon intertidal habitat, sustainability of flood defences and causing saline intrusion into the groundwater. Pressure for housing will cause an increase in visitor numbers and footfall, increasing levels of disturbance around the estuary, as will the agreement over the route for the Coastal Path. Disturbance has also been caused in the estuary landscape by the installation of infrastructure for the Anglia 1 offshore wind turbine array. Given these pressures and the Deben may become the victim of its own popularity both afloat and ashore, it is not an option to just update the existing management plan. This has led the DEP to decide to focus upon the nature of change, what evidence there may be in the estuary, what a future scenario may look like and what strategies should be put in place to adapt and to manage it.Since many changes in landscape are so incremental that communities may not be aware of their significance, it will be a challenge to develop a format for a discussion about how to build a management plan around the certainties and uncertainties to be faced in future. Since the conditions that both affect and respond to change are profoundly cultural as much as factual, it makes sense that an arts and science team might collaborate with the DEP to devise a programme of workshops for community members to accumulate and negotiate evidence for the estuary plan.The proposal is to generate six workshop events through 2000-2001 to explore themes relating to understanding change in the context of the Deben Estuary and to make this a material discourse requiring participants to contribute to the accumulation of evidence during the project. The final workshop will be a feedback session to reflect on what has been learned, followed at the end of 2021 by an exhibition of the material produced at a suitable location in the estuary to which all participants, institutional and community stakeholders will be invited and will subsequently be open to the wider public.Our aspiration is that working in partnership with the DEP, a reflexive and reflective arts/science activity will enhance a sense of understanding of estuary systems, foster a more informed level of debate and have the potential to contribute materially to the Deben Estuary Plan.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,AH/T006161/1,,,,,,,,Middlesex University,,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:15379399,,

Fragmentation of the trinuclear cluster (n-Bu4N)2[Mo3(mu3-S)(mu-S2)3(dmit)3] in the presence of triphenylphosphine (PPh3) gives the dinuclear compound (n-Bu4N)2[Mo2O2(mu-S)2(dmit)2] {(n-Bu4N)2[2]}, which is formed via oxidation in air from the intermediate (n-Bu4N)2[Mo3(mu3-S)(mu-S)3(dmit)3] {(n-Bu4N)2[1]} complex. Ligand substitution of the molybdenum sulfur bridged [Mo2O2(mu-S)2(dimethylformamide)6]2+ dimer with the sodium salt of the dmit dithiolate also affords the dianionic compound (n-Bu4N)2[2].

Direct evidence of the presence of the intermediates with the formula [M3Q4(dmit)3]2- (M = Mo, W; Q = S, Se) has been obtained by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry. The crystal structures of (n-Bu4N)2[1], (PPh4)2[Mo2O2(mu-S)2(dmit)2] {(PPh4)2[2]; PPh4 = tetraphenylphosphonium}, (n-Bu4N)2[2], (n-Bu4N)2[4], (PPh4)2[W2O2(mu-Se)2(dmit)2] {(PPh4)2[5]}, and (n-Bu4N)2[6] have been determined. A detailed study of the gas-phase behavior for compounds (n-Bu4N)2[26] shows an identical fragmentation pathway for the whole family that consists of a partial breaking of the two dithiolene ligands followed by the dissociation of the dinuclear cluster.

The performance of horizontal axis wind and tidal turbines mainly depends on the geometrical properties such as chord and twist distributions and also the types of sections which are utilized along the blade. The purpose of presented paper is introducing a procedure which can be utilized in order to select the optimum sections for horizontal axis tidal turbines for the purpose of increasing the turbine performance. The presented procedure also can be applied for horizontal axis wind turbines. For the purpose of evaluating the performance of the proposed method, two design types (chord and twist distributions) of tidal turbines are selected as case studies. Power coefficient is considered as objective function, and three types of hydrofoils namely NACA63-8xx, NACA44xx, and RISO-A1-xx are selected as candidate solutions. A blade element momentum theory model is used for calculating the power coefficient. The discrete ant colony optimization algorithm is selected as optimization tool. The results indicate that the utilization of the proposed method will considerably decrease the required process time for obtaining the optimum sections across the blade span, and also it is shown that using different types of sections across the blade span can increase the power coefficient of the turbine.

The survey consisted of acoustically mapping specific seep sites within the Coal Oil Point seep field, commonly known as Platform Holly, Seep Tent, La Goleta, Patch and Trilogy. The survey was conducted with three downward-looking broadband echosounders: an MSI Constant Beamwidth Transducer (CBW) (30-100 kHz), a Simrad ES200-7C split-beam echosounder (150-250 kHz) and a Simrad ES333 split-beam echosounder (290-490 kHz). The echosounders were interfaced with an EK80 Wideband Transceiver and were deployed on a tow sled on the port side of the R/V Connell. A Garmin WAAS-enabled GPS was attached to the tow sled and was integrated into the Simrad EK80 software to record the position of the echosounders. A Seabird 19plus V2 CTD was used to collect profiles of salinity and temperature in the water column after each survey. A 300 kHz RDI ADCP was used for measuring water current profiles. During the last day of survey, 14 September 2016, a low-frequency single-beam transducer (1-10 kHz) was used to map a small subset of the seep field. All surveys were performed at vessel speeds of 4-6 knots depending on the weather conditions of the survey day.On 31 August 2016, the instruments were mounted to the R/V Connell and were tested during an on-shore shake down.On 1 September 2016, the tow sled and instruments were tested at-sea using various configurations in order to determine the optimal configuration to minimize noise interference with the echosounders.On 2 September 2016, an EW 500 m by 500 m survey, with 10 m line spacing, was conducted at Patch. Gas seepage was visible throughout the survey, both in the acoustic data and near the surface of the water column. The sea surface was lightly oiled in some areas of the survey. The survey took four hours to complete and was followed with a CTD cast. Finally, a short (500 m) transect ADCP survey was conducted.On 6 September 2016, a NS 500 m by 500 m survey, with 10 m line spacing, was conducted near Platform Holly. Gas seepage was visible predominantly near the platform, both in the acoustic data and significantly by eye near the platform. The sea surface was heavily oiled, especially near the platform. The survey took a total of four hours to complete and was followed with a CTD cast near the center of the survey area. An initial attempt at calibrating the echosounders was performed south of Platform Holly, however it was decided to move east of Patch for the calibration to avoid seeps during the calibration procedure. The calibration was performed using a 38.1 mm and 25.0 mm Tungsten-Carbide calibration spheres. A 12.67 mm Tungsten-Carbide calibration sphere was also used to attempt to calibrate the echosounders, however it was too small and light to use in the calibration site.On 7 September 2016, an EW 500 m by 500 m survey, with 10 m line spacing, was conducted at Seep Tent. The sea surface was heavily oiled at the site. Gas bubbles were also observed at the sea surface in the site. The survey took four hours to complete and was followed by a second EW 500 m by 500 m survey, with 10 m line spacing, conducted at La Goleta. Oil and gas bubbles were observed at the sea surface throughout the survey area. The survey took approximate four hours and forty minutes to complete and was followed with a CTD cast near the La Goleta survey area.On 8 September 2016, an EW 1000 m (EW) by 600 m (NS) survey, with 20 m line spacing, was conducted at Trilogy, followed by 6 evenly spaced NS lines across the survey area. The sea surface was slightly oiled in some locations in the survey area and three distinct locations within the seep area had significant quantity of gas bubbles at the sea surface. The survey took four and a half hours to complete and was followed with a CTD cast in the survey area. Following the CTD cast, ADCP operations were performed around Platform Holly. A NS line was conducted, once going north and then repeated going south, to the west of Platform Holly. A similar NS line was performed in both directions very close to the platform on the east side of the platform. It appeared that the lines were too close to the platform and the pilings caused issues with the data. Another NS line, heading north then south, was completed farther east from the platform. Another survey was conducted near Platform Holly. Survey lines were conducted as circles around the platform, starting as close as possible to the platform and extending the circle diameter until no seepage activity was observed in the acoustic data.On 9 September 2016, a SE-NW 1300 m by 8500 m survey, with 412.5 m line spacing, was conducted. In addition, three groups of two lines, perpendicular to the broad survey lines, were conducted between seep sites. The broad survey encompassed the Platform Holly, Seep Tent, La Goleta and Patch seep sites. The survey took a total of five hours to complete and was followed with a CTD cast near the Patch survey site. A NS transect line was conducted with the ADCP near Patch after the CTD cast.On 12 September 2016, a SE-NW 600 m by 850 m survey, with 20 m line spacing, was conducted to the northwest of Seep Tent. The survey took approximately one hour to complete. A CTD cast and a NS ADCP survey were performed after the survey near Seep Tent. A transit line was conducted between the ADCP survey site and Platform Holly. Once the vessel reached Platform Holly, another ADCP survey was conducted near the platform. An acoustic survey was conducted, with random lines, near Platform Holly. The survey was conducted with the intent of locating oil surfacing near the gas seep.On 13 September 2016, a broad SE-NW survey with two lines centered between the previous broad survey lines was conducted. Two NS survey lines were conducted near Platform Holly. Two NS survey lines were conducted through the center and west part of La Goleta and then two additional NS lines were conducted near Patch. A CTD cast was performed after the survey, in the vicinity of the Patch seep site.On 14 September 2016, two broad SW-NE survey lines were conducted using the low-frequency (1-10 kHz) single-beam echosounder. One NS survey line was conducted to the west of Platform Holly and then acoustic data was collected while the vessel drifted around the west side of the platform. Additional NS survey lines were conducted at Seep Tents, La Goleta and Patch. Acoustic data while the vessel drifted was also collected at these survey sites. A CTD casts was performed at the end of the acoustic survey.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2020-03-03,DRCI:DATA2020024018055622,,

Here we provide an example of such integration from our exploration of effects of the Exxon Valdez oil spill (EVOS) on river otters (Lontra canadensis) inhabiting the terrestrial-marine interface in Prince William Sound, Alaska, USA. Our research was divided into 2 phases: an early phase (1989-92) immediately following the oil spill; and a late phase (1996-99), which focused on potential chronic effects of oil contamination in the Sound. We used a variety of measurements that considered the physiological status and health of individual river otters, as well as aspects of their ecology, behavior, and demography. We then conducted meta-analysis to explore interactions between individual-based and population-level data in demonstrating injury and subsequent recovery of otters from ill effects of EVOS. During both phases of our studies, we first conducted intensive research at 2 study sites, which we believed to be oiled and nonoiled, and then expanded our investigations throughout similar areas of Prince William Sound. Nonetheless, our data are best interpreted as differences between heavily oiled areas and lightly oiled sites because later information indicated that our reference sites were lightly oiled. Thus we refer to heavily oiled sites as oiled and lightly oiled sites as nonoiled. In the later phase, we were part of a broader ecosystem-based project (Nearshore Vertebrate Predators) designed to assess long-term effects of EVOS on a suite of key organisms, and to determine whether those species had recovered from that catastrophic accident.We used radiotelemetry to locate carcasses of animals that died from natural causes, and documented that searching beaches immediately following the spill was not a reliable method for locating dead river otters. Our early research (1989-92) demonstrated that river otters living in oiled areas had lower body mass (P < 0.04) and elevated biomarkers (P < 0.05) in their blood (e.g., haptoglobin [Hp], interleukin-6 immunoreactive [IL-6 ir], aspartate aminotransferase [AST]) than otters inhabiting nonoiled areas. Likewise, otters from oiled areas had higher levels of fecal porphyrins (P < 0.001), ate a less-diverse diet (P < 0.001), had larger home ranges (P < 0.05), and selected habitats differently (P < 0.01) than otters living in areas that were not heavily oiled. A mark-recapture analysis based on radiotracers in otter feces during 1990 indicated no difference (P > 0.10) between density of otters in Herring Bay (oiled) or Esther Passage (nonoiled), but no prespill data were available. Likewise, by 1992, biomarkers (Hp, IL-6 ir, AST) did not differ (P > 0.05) between oiled and nonoiled areas.During the later phase of research, hydrocarbons on the pelage of river otters and the elevation of endothelial P450-1A, a biomarker sensitive to hydrocarbon exposure, indicated that river otters were exposed to oil still present in Prince William Sound. Nonetheless, body mass of otters continued to increase on oiled areas over tune (P < 0.05), and eventually did not differ from otters living in nonoiled sites (P > 0.05). All blood biomarkers (Hp, IL-6 ir, AST) were markedly reduced from the early phase of our research, and no longer differed (P > 0.10) between oiled and nonoiled sites. We used principal component analysis (PCA) to determine that few differences existed in an array of blood characteristics for otters inhabiting oiled and nonoiled sites, and those differences that did exist likely were related to diet. Corpoporphyrin III, a key biomarker in home synthesis, was reduced (P = 0.008) from post-spill collections made in 1990 in the oiled area, and no longer differed (P > 0.05) between oiled and nonoiled areas in 1996. We used stable isotope analysis to investigate differences in diet of river otters inhabiting oiled and nonoiled areas in 1996-97. When we controlled for otters inhabiting extensive freshwater habitats (which did not occur in our early studies), no differences in diet or the trophic level of otters were identified (P > 0.20) for otters living in oiled versus nonoiled sites. Similarly, density of marine fishes (greater than or equal to8 con in total length) on underwater transects did not differ (P = 0.97) between oiled and nonoiled areas, although an area by year interaction occurred (P = 0.01). Habitat selection by otters also was altered from the early phase; river otters on both study areas selected vegetated slopes that were not steep, and selected sites with more understory (brush) and greater exposure; selection for those characteristics was more pronounced in the oiled area. Otters on both sites avoided (use < availability) gravel and small rocks. Although selected variables differed between oiled and nonoiled sites (P < 0.001), the direction of selection did not differ between areas. Moreover, tidal slope did not enter any of the models, in contrast to our early studies, indicating that differences in selection were not related to avoidance of oiled shores. Hone-range size declined (P < 0.05) for otters living in oiled areas, and no longer differed (P > 0.7) from animals inhabiting nonoiled sites. We enumerated populations from oiled and nonoiled areas using a combination of live-captured individuals and DNA fingerprinting using microsatellite from otter feces at latrines. We also performed a conventional reconstruction based on age structure to calculate population size in 1997. Those methods indicated that most animals in the population were recruited following the oil spill and both methods characterized slowly (lambda = 1.03-1.06) growing or stable population in the oiled area. Age structure of river otters in the Sound differed neither between oiled and nonoiled areas (P > 0.36), nor from a harvested population of river otters in Maine (P > 0.49). Finally, survivorship of river otters did not differ (P > 0.2) between oiled and nonoiled areas of Prince William Sound and was high compared with data on other otter populations in North America. Our data indicate that although river otters continued to be exposed to low levels of crude oil, effects of that exposure were no longer sufficient to cause obvious injury. We cautiously conclude that river otters have recovered from the more pernicious effects of EVOS.Based on our experiences in this research, we provide theoretical considerations for use of biomarkers in wildlife studies and describe statistical approaches, including principal component analysis of blood variables, which may assist researchers with interpreting complicated results of multiple variables and datasets. Likewise, we describe how dose-response curves should be used in understanding population-level responses to pollutants. We hope that this monograph will provide valuable insights for other wildlife biologists on the process of integration of toxicological data with that of ecological data useful for studying effects of pollution on wildlife populations and their habitats.",,,,,,,,,71,0,0,0,67,1,82,,,0084-0173,1938-5455,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2003-07-01,WOS:000184304100001,,

Kinetic studies with H-1 NMR microimaging showed that the dispersed water in the silica gel pore system reacts readily with the gas, thus obviating the need for a stirred reactor and excess water. Hydrate phase equilibria for the ternary CO2-N-2-water system in silica gel pores were measured, which show that the three-phase hydrate-water-rich liquid-vapor equilibrium curves were shifted to higher pressures at a specific temperature when the concentration of CO2 in the vapor phase decreased. C-13 cross-polarization NMR spectral analysis and direct measurement of the CO2 content in the hydrate phase suggested that the mixed hydrate is structure 1 at gas compositions of more than 10 mol % CO2, and that the CO2 molecules occupy mainly the more abundant 5(12)6(2) cages. This makes it possible to achieve concentrations of more than 96 mol % CO2 gas in the product after three cycles of hydrate formation and dissociation.

Following the Deepwater Horizon oil spill, many investigations into the responses of sediment microbial communities to oil pollution have been undertaken. However, hydrostatic pressure is a parameter that is often omitted due to the technical difficulties associated with conducting experiments at high pressure (>10 MPa). In this study, sediments from 2,900 m in the Hatton-Rockall Basin, following a one-week decompression period in a temperature-controlled room at 5 degrees C, were incubated in factorial combinations of 0.1 and 30 MPa, 5 and 20 degrees C, and contamination with a hydrocarbon mixture or uncontaminated controls to evaluate the effect of these environmental variables on the bacterial community composition. Our results revealed varying effects of pressure, temperature, and oil contamination on the composition of the bacterial community within the sediment. Temperature was the strongest determinant of differences in the bacterial community structure between samples followed by pressure. Oil contamination did not exert a strong change in the sediment bacterial community structure when pressure and temperature conditions were held at in situ levels (30 MPa and 5 degrees C). The gamma-proteobacteria Pseudomonas and Colwellia, and several Bacteroidetes dominated communities at 30 MPa. In contrast, hydrocarbon degraders such as Halomonas, Alcanivorax, and Marinobacter decreased in relative abundance at the same pressure.

However, cyclonic storms may also generate seaward-directed flow and sediment transport, which is not typically accounted for in barrier island modeling. A strong outflow occurred at Port Aransas, Texas during Hurricane Harvey in 2017, as evidenced from field observations, satellite photos, and tide data; modeling indicates that outflow was forced by offshore winds to the left of landfall. To investigate the impact of this event on the barrier system, we collected post-storm multibeam bathymetry data and sediment samples within Aransas Pass and Lydia Ann Channel, important conduits linking the bays to the Gulf of Mexico, and where such data were previously collected in 2009 and 2012. The 2009-2012 comparison provides a baseline against which to ascertain the storm impact contained in the 2012-2017 comparison. Both land-and marine-based evidence indicate that significant erosion accompanied the outflow event, focused at the edges of the Corpus Christi ship channel and Lydia Ann Channel. Large quantities of sand, up to 6.5 m thick, also accumulate in deeps of Aransas Pass and Lydia Ann Channel, presumably as the outflow event waned in strength. We infer that the outflow event transported a large amount of barrier system sands offshore, but do not have sufficient constraints at this time to quantify it. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Enhanced aeolian activity during the LGM occurred in arid and semi-arid regions of western, central and eastern Australia. The east coast has been considered to have been better watered and vegetated. However, at a number of sites from Tasmania to North Queensland, there is evidence for extensive aeolian instability of coastal sand deposits. Dating by radiocarbon and thermoluminiscence techniques has supported morphologic and stratigraphic evidence of dune formation during the LGM under the influence of westerly (offshore) winds in the southern sector of the east coast (i.e. south of 31-degrees-S latitude) and southeast winds to the north. It is now apparent that vegetation cover on sandy surfaces was quite patchy during the LGM. Sand surface instability under conditions of strong west or southeast winds promoted linear and/or parabolic dune development. This suggests greater concentration of forests in more discrete, protected sites along the eastern escarpment than was previously considered by palaeoecologists. More widespread drier and cooler climatic conditions operated even in coastal regions on expanded continental shelves at this time.

Hence an object moving in any direction can be shown real time.All acoustic 3D data are known with respect to reflection intensity and x,y and z co-ordinates and can thus be shown in a 3D environment, i.e. the observer can change observation point in the 3D scene in order to acquire the best possible information. Moreover, knowledge of the 3D geometry allows for extraction of x,y,z co-ordinates for any pixel in the 3D image. Size and distance data are thus easy to obtain.The 3D presentation method allows for addition of virtual objects in the scene. Such an object can be a man-made structure like a pipeline, an oil rig, an ROV etc. The virtual objects can be described in VRML-format, a format that can be exported from most 3D design software packages.The detection range of acoustical imaging systems extends to at least 100 metres - a range that exceeds the capabilities of any optical system. Also, even in near zero visibility environments, an acoustical system will generate images.

Even in less severe situations, recovery will usually occur within two to ten years. In the areas that received oil supply, marine organisms are under impact through different mechanisms related to its physical and chemical properties and the form of their incorporation by different substrates. It can lead to direct and indirect effects with consequences for survival, reproduction, development and general activities of the organisms. The process of remediation of this type of contamination can use multiple strategies, from natural attenuation to invasive treatments. Whether natural or induced attenuation, monitoring biological and geochemical processes is crucial. This project aims to assess the impacts of oil on the structure of communities and population density of key organisms as well as on their activity patterns, damage to the development of organisms, effects on the reproductive potential of biological groups selected through Pernambuco beaches and reefs. We will use a wide variety of tools, biological impact indicators, and innovative technologies. Besides, the project aims to investigate potential specific geophysical signatures caused by the oil spill that hit the beaches of Pernambuco, Northeast Brazil. We will assess the degree of severity of the impact of the oil spill on beach and reef ecosystems. We will address the current situation of biological indicators compared to data collected in the past in the study areas. We will consider the following variables in this project: density and diversity of selected groups of macrofauna and meiofauna; functional groups of Nematoda and Polychaeta; reproductive and malformation indicators of Copepoda Harpacticoida and Amphipoda; diversity and amounts of fatty acids of selected species of macrofauna and meiofauna groups; bioacoustics / ecoacoustics of reef environments, and geophysical signature.

The cylindrical shell is reinforced with external axial stiffeners. The material properties are assumed to vary continuously through the thickness direction. Equilibrium and stability equations for cylindrical shells are derived by using the classical shell theory (CST) with von-Karman nonlinear kinematic relations. Using analytical approach, Galerkin procedure, and the Airy stress function, the resulting equations are employed to obtain the closed-form expression for the critical buckling loads and load-deflection relation. The influences of the number of stiffeners, volume fraction exponent, the thickness of the metal layer, and geometric parameters on the nonlinear buckling behavior of the cylindrical shell with FG coatings are examined in details.

The simulations implied that offshore wind-driven transport of larvae is balanced by onshore geostrophic flow. Additional simulations revealed that vertical migration behaviour was essential to larval survival through its impact on advection. The six years simulated include two of high, two of low, and two of average puerulus settlement. The most robust interannual difference of the simulations was that, when coastal sea level was low and the Leeuwin Current was weak, more early-stage larvae were lost to the north and west under the influence of the wind. Conversely, many late-stage model larvae were carried south of the fishery in years when the Leeuwin Current was strong. The fraction of model larvae remaining or arriving offshore of the fishery and metamorphosing was essentially constant from year to year, so the variation in observed puerulus settlement was not explained by the model. The results imply that the nonadvective effects of fluctuations in the Leeuwin ( e. g., on temperature and primary production) were primarily responsible for the high variation in natural settlement.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,1323-1650,,,,,,,,,,,"CSIRO Marine Res, Hobart, Tas 7001, AustraliaNatl Inst Water & Atmospher Res, Auckland, New ZealandFisheries WA, Western Australian Marine Res Labs, N Beach, WA 6920, AustraliaCSIRO Marine Res, N Beach, WA 6920, Australia",,,,2002-01-01,WOS:000176662100011,,

The array consisted of 6 stations that spanned the nearshore measuring waves, currents, temperature, and salinity for a two-week period in December 2013. CAOs are prevalent during winter and are characterized by the passage of atmospheric cold fronts with offshore winds known to cool coastal waters. The prefrontal phases of CAOs coincided with downwelling favorable winds and westward flow that introduced a river plume into the nearshore. Offshore winds during the high pressure phase formed a two-layer circulation with offshore flow in the surface layer and onshore flow beneath, which was moderated by a river plume. The downwind advection of the river plume tended to enhance surface transport until the plume was flushed out of the nearshore, which formed adverse density gradients that reduced surface transport through vertical mixing. When the plume was not fully flushed out of the inner shelf, surface transport remained enhanced during the high pressure phase due to stratification that limited the formation of adverse density gradients. When the plume was initially shore detached at the onset of the high pressure phase, offshore flow was not enhanced by the downwind advection of the plume due to the existence of initial adverse density gradients.

In this study, a meso-scale model MM5 was used to simulate SLBs and to understand the transport of pollution during a prolonged ozone episode observed in Hong Kong in September 2001. With the designed settings, the model performed very well in the simulation of SLBs. The simulated surface winds and the planetary boundary layer (PBL) heights are presented to contrast the characteristics of dispersion and transport on pre-episode and episode days. The diurnal variations in horizontal and vertical winds on an episode day are then presented to illustrate the evolution of SLBs. The results indicate that on episode days the onset of sea breezes (SBs) was delayed to noontime due to offshore synoptic winds, while on pre-episode days the SBs had already penetrated deep inland by early afternoon. The simulation shows that SBs propagated in both onshore and offshore directions in the afternoon, leading to the formation of nocturnal regional-scale SBs. The maximum distance for the inland penetration of an SB front (SBF) was about 60-80 km, in contrast to 120-150 km for offshore propagation. With the aid of high-resolution trajectories, the main meteorological factors contributing to the occurrence of the observed ozone episode are discussed. It is believed that the offshore synoptic wind, the delayed SBs, as well as the low mixing height contributed to the daytime transport of pollution and high ozone on the coast. The trajectory analysis also indicates important contributions from regional sources of emission. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

[Subacoustech Report No. 544R0738.],,,,,,,,i,"iv, 1-80",,,,,,,,,,,Book,2007,2007,"Subacoustech Ltd has been contracted by The Crown Estate on behalf of the Collaborative Offshore Wind Research Into the Environment (COWRIE) to measure the underwater noise generated by offshore windfarms during construction and operation. The purpose of the programme of measurements is to provide information which will aid the estimation and minimisation of the impact of noise during the lifecycle (construction, operation and decommissioning) of windfarms. Previous reports have established that pile driving during windfarm construction creates high levels of underwater noise. Injury of marine species could be caused by the pile driving noise at distances of the order of 100 metres, and behavioural effects at ranges of the order of 10 kilometres or more. To further document the noise levels created during pile driving, further measurements are presented herein, taken during pile driving on five windfarms, at North Hoyle, Scroby Sands, Kentish Flats, Barrow and Burbo Bank. The measurements indicate that the Source Levels of these five pile driving operations varied between 243 and 257 dB re 1 Pa @ 1 metre, having an average value of 250 dB re 1 Pa @ 1 metre. The Transmission Losses were characterised by values of geometric loss factor N of 17 to 21, and absorption factor of 0.0003 to 0.0047 dB/m. The measurements are analysed in the dBht metric, which weights noise according to the hearing sensitivity of marine species of animals, and thus indicates the likely loudness of the noise. The concept of noise dose, used to estimate the cumulative effect of noise on humans, may also be extended to marine mammals by this means. On this basis, a method which is relatively simple to calculate and apply is proposed for estimating areas around a pile driving operation within which the two key auditory effects of noise will occur. This method may be summarised as Provided animals are free to flee the noise, those within the area bounded by the 90 dBht level contour will strongly avoid the noise. Animals within the area bounded by the 130 dBht level contour may suffer injury or permanent damage to hearing. Since the injury ranges indicated by the measurements do not exceed a few hundred metres, they indicate that observation by marine mammal observers and soft start procedures might be effective in reducing these effects of the noise. Measurements are also presented of noise during the operation of the North Hoyle, Scroby Sands, Kentish Flats and Barrow offshore windfarms. In general, the level of noise created by operational windfarms was found to be very low and no evidence was found of noise levels that might have the capacity to cause marine animals to avoid the area. The environment of a windfarm was found to be on average about 2 dB noisier for fish, and no noisier for marine mammals, than the surrounding area. This is no more than variations which might be encountered by these animals during their normal course of activity.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,978-0-9554279-5-4,,,,,,,,,"Subacoustech Ltd, Chase Mill, Winchester Rd, Waltham, Hampshire, SO32 1A, United Kingdom",,,,2007-01-01,ZOOREC:ZOOR14503017855,,

The framework yields a nonlinear response curve that supplies structural nonlinear behaviors, capacities and plasticity development as functions of wave height. The dynamic amplification, current speed, loading direction, marine growth and soil-structure interaction (SSI) on the nonlinear response of the example OST under wave and current loads are then investigated.

The dominant forcing mechanisms are monsoon winds and mesoscale eddies studied by multiple regression analysis. In the offshore regions, strong winds directly caused the enhancements by local vertical mixing and entrainment. As in the near-shore regions, the alongshore winds indirectly caused the enhancements by inducing coastal upwelling. Although SST is highly correlated with Chl-a concentration, SST cooling is difficult to observe in the bloom region. It is considered a consequence of monsoon and eddy forcings.

Michael University of Delaware Water and chemical fluxes between aquifers and the ocean are critically important to biological, geological, and geochemical processes at the coast. Groundwater inputs to the sea can cause algal blooms and modify ocean chemistry, and seawater infiltration to land causes aquifer salinization and alters solute and mineral composition of the subsurface. A unique challenge in quantifying aquifer-ocean fluxes is the wide range of spatial and temporal scales over which the mechanisms that drive exchange operate. Forcing occurs on timescales of waves, seasons, and glacial cycles, with corresponding spatial scales from ripples to continental shelves. Integrating the scales of exchange is essential for understanding and predicting the impacts of these fluxes through geologic history and as sea level changes in the future. The long-term vision of this work is to improve understanding of physical processes that connect aquifers and the sea through research and education that link geosciences and mathematics. The research project will explore the influence of geologic heterogeneity (spatial variations in hydrogeologic properties) on continental shelf-scale ocean-aquifer water exchange processes. Geostatistical modeling and variable-density groundwater flow and solute transport simulation will be used to understand the influence of the geometry of heterogeneity on (1) spatial patterns of seafloor water exchange, (2) density-driven saltwater circulation in the subsurface, and (3) seawater intrusion into aquifers, processes important for water resources, coastal ecosystems, and ocean chemistry. Two systems that display very different geometry and connectivity of geologic features will be modeled: the Bengal Delta and the Hawaiian Islands. This research will be linked to an educational program designed to integrate mathematics into geoscience curricula. A groundwater-surface water exchange activity for high school students in Delaware and Hawaii will be developed and implemented through cooperation with the Delaware Nature Society and Kamehmeha Schools, and new and modified undergraduate and graduate courses that incorporate aspects of the research will be offered at the University of Delaware. This project will create new knowledge of the physical processes that generate water exchange between aquifers and the ocean and the water and chemical fluxes that they produce. The work will fill a gap in understanding of the role of the geologic structure of an aquifer in translating these physical processes into groundwater salinization (flux from sea to land) and groundwater flow to the ocean (flux from land to sea) on the scale of the continental shelf. The work will have impacts on education, water resource management, and ecological preservation. Scientific results will provide water resources managers with a basis for improving management models and risk assessments. Insights gained will improve design of future field studies, enhance efforts to protect fragile coastal ecosystems, and may have implications for offshore drilling activities and siting of wind farms. Improved prediction of land-sea fluxes will also allow us to better anticipate and adapt to potential effects of climate change on coastal water resources and ecosystems.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,1151733,,,,,,,,University of Delaware,,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:13614648,,

Generalizing the glider survey observations with hourly wind data from nearby meteorological stations, it is found that upwelling in the BE area occurs for wind directions between 190 to 260 degrees and wind speed exceeding 4 m s(-1). Based on these thresholds the wind-induced summer (June to September) upwelling conditions in the BE area for the period 1982 to 2012 are reconstructed. On average about 18 days of upwelling favourable wind conditions are found for the four summer months, with significant interannual variability ranging from 7.7 days (2006) to more than 28 days (1985).

However, previous research concerning shales has predominantly focused on marine shales and barely on marine-continental transitional shales. In this study, geochemical and mineralogical analyses were performed on 23 marine-continental transitional shale samples obtained from four wells in a currently active shale gas play, Yushe-Wuxiang area in the Qinshui Basin. Furthermore, the complex pore structure of the transitional shales was well characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), mercury intrusion, and low pressure gas physisorption. The results showed the abundance of organic matter (OM) with an average of 2.03% in the target shales. The dominant minerals in the shale were found to be clay and quartz, and the major clay minerals type is kaolinite and Illite/smectite. SEM images clearly exhibited that the pores in the shale matrix are mainly associated with clay minerals and OM. Results of mercury intrusion and low pressure gas physisorption indicated the presence of pore volumes (PVs) and specific surface area (SSA) with different scales. The pore size distribution analysis indicated that mesopores were dominant in the shale from the study area. The PV was mainly attributed to the presence of mesopores and macropores, and the SSA was mainly associated with the mesopores and micropores. Results of research on factors controlling pore structure development showed that it was principally controlled by clay mineral contents and total organic carbon content. The pore structure characteristics of the marine-continental transitional shale may have contributed to the preservation of shale gas in Yushe-Wuxiang area. This study provides important significance in gaining a comprehensive understanding of the transitional shale pore structure and the shale gas storage-seepage mechanism.",,,,,,,,,51,10,0,0,1,0,58,,,0887-0624,1520-5029,,,,,,,,,,"China Univ Geosci, MOE Key Lab Marine Reservoir Evolut & Hydrocarbon, Beijing 100083, Peoples R ChinaChina Univ Geosci, MOLR Key Lab Shale Gas Resources Survey & Strateg, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China",,,,2017-09-05,WOS:000408178100015,,

From January through April, this open water periodically exposed the shelf to sediment entrainment by suspension freezing. This process requires turbulence and supercooled water, which results in the formation of frazil and anchor ice. The resulting granular, sediment-laden ice was observed to extend over 100 km seaward of the outer continental shelf after having been advected offshore. It was sampled to determine sediment type and to quantify the particle load. The particle size was mainly silt and clay, with local admixtures of as much as 27% sand and coarser clasts. Melted ice samples contained from 31 to nearly 600 mg L-1 of sediment. Combining these data with over 400 km of shipboard and aerial observations, photographs, and computer analysis of a summer Landsat image, we estimated the sediment load per unit area of sea ice. Seaward of the shelf, in regions of dense pack ice, a conservatively estimated sediment load was over 289 t km-2. Using a westward summer drift rate of 3 cm s-1, the sediment transport through a 1-km-long north-south segment is 67,418 t during 3 mo. In terms of regional sediment dynamics (littoral transport estimated at 10,000 t during the same period) and sediment budget (continental denudation estimated at 10 t k-m2 during the same period), this number is very significant. Benthic microfossils indicate that bottom sediment incorporated in the ice came from water depths ranging from the inner neritic seaward to 50 m. The large load of shelf-derived sediment observed seaward of the continental shelf indicates that ice entrainment and transport cause shelf erosion.

However, the process of migration is a source of risk for migratory species as human actions increasingly destroy and fragment habitat, create obstacles to migration, and increase mortality along the migration corridor. As a result, many migratory species are declining in numbers. In the United States, the Endangered Species Act provides some protection against extinction for such species, but no protection until numbers are severely reduced, and no guarantee of recovery to population levels associated with cultural, ecological, or economic significance. Although groups of species receive some protection from statutes such as the Migratory Bird Treaty Act and Marine Mammal Protection Act, there is no coordinated system for conservation of migratory species. In addition, information needed to protect migratory species is often lacking, limiting options for land and wildlife managers who seek to support these species. In this Article, we outline the existing scientific, legal, and management information and approaches to migratory species. Our objective is to assess present capacity to protect the species and the phenomenon of migration, and we argue that al three disciplines are necessary for effective conservation. We find significant capacity to support conservation in all three disciplines, but no organization around conservation of migration within any discipline or among the three disciplines. Areas of synergy exist among the disciplines but not as a result of any attempt for coordination. As a result, significant gaps in information and capacity exist that must be addressed if effective conservation of migratory species is to be undertaken. We suggest that all three disciplines cooperate to identify the most pressing research needs, so that these can become targets for relevant funding sources. We identify areas of current risk to migratory species that represent gaps in current legal protections: protective legislation that provides no guidelines for desirable population sizes or best management practices for migratory species, taxonomic groups, particularly those including long-distance migrants, for which no agency has oversight, and gaps in policies to address impacts of fragmentation and obstacles such as power lines and wind turbines that curtail migration or cause mortality. Finally, we suggest that state-level programs provide either a foundation to augment with, or a model on which to build, conservation efforts targeting migratory species. Problems will arise due to lack of funds, difficulties in securing a landscape that will support abundant migrations, lack of adequate standards and best management practices, and an insufficient culture of collaboration among the three main relevant disciplines. However, we view these problems as entirely soluble and see evidence of support in society at large for conservation of migratory species.",,,,,,,,,12,0,0,0,7,1,14,,,0046-2276,,,,,,,,,,,"Associate Professor, School of Public and Environmental Affairs (SPEA), and affiliated Associate Professor of Law, Indiana University Maurer School of Law, Indiana University, Bloomington, Indiana.

Determining the spatial distribution of gas hydrates at MVs is crucial to evaluate their sensitivity to known episodic changes in volcanic activity. We determined the hydrocarbon inventory and spatial distribution of hydrates at an individual MV structure. The Hakon Mosby Mud Volcano (HMMV), located at 1,250 m water depth on the Barents Sea slope, was investigated by combined pressure core sampling, heat flow measurements, and pore water chemical analysis. Quantitative pressure core degassing revealed gas-sediment ratios between 3.1 and 25.7, corresponding to hydrate concentrations of up to 21.3% of the pore volume. Hydrocarbon compositions and physicochemical conditions imply that gas hydrates incipiently crystallize as structure I hydrate, with a dissociation temperature of around 13.8 degrees C at this water depth. Based on numerous in situ measurements of the geothermal gradient in the seabed, pore water sulfate profiles and microbathymetric data, we show that the thickness of the GHSZ increases from less than 1 m at the warm center to around 47 m in the outer parts of the HMMV. We estimate the total mass of hydrate-bound methane stored at the HMMV to be about 102.5 kt, of which 2.8 kt are located within the morphological Unit I around the center and thus are likely to be dissociated in the course of a large eruption.",,,,,,,,,28,1,0,0,3,0,29,,,1525-2027,,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Bremen, MARUM Ctr Marine Environm Sci, D-28334 Bremen, GermanyUniv Bremen, Dept Geosci, D-28334 Bremen, GermanyUniv Kiel, Leibniz Inst Marine Sci, IFM GEOMAR, D-24148 Kiel, GermanyAlfred Wegener Inst Polar & Marine Res, D-27570 Bremerhaven, Germany",,,,2011-10-12,WOS:000295134900001,,

We expected that if aerial insects actively resist overwater drift, then (1) radar-observed clear-air echoes should accumulate along the coastline when winds blow offshore, but they should be advected inland rapidly when winds blow onshore; and (2) accumulations of aerial plankton should be greatest along stretches of coastline most nearly perpendicular to the ambient wind flow. We tested these predictions by comparing the distribution of clear-air radar reflectivity at different sites and under different regimes of wind during the Convection and Precipitation/Electrification (CaPE) Experiment, which was conducted on the east coast of Florida in the summer of 1991. Elevated levels of clear-air reflectivity were evident along the coast on mornings when winds were from the west, but not on mornings with easterly winds. On days with westerly winds, this coastal enhancement occurred only in the morning, prior to the onset of the sea breeze. Following sea breeze development, coastal concentrations of clear-air echoes were advected westward and they dispersed rapidly; levels of clear-air reflectivity became depressed overall throughout the study area in the afternoon compared to the morning. Clear-air reflectivity was higher along a north-facing coastline compared to a south-facing coastline when winds had a northward component, with a mirror-image reversal of this pattern on days with southward winds. In contrast, clear-air echoes were uniformly nearly absent from the airspace over the adjacent ocean at all times of the day on all days. These findings support the hypothesis that the organisms comprising the aerial plankton respond behaviourally to coastlines to avoid being blown out to sea. Persistent concentrations of aerial plankton along coastlines may have important consequences for insect population dynamics and local ecosystem structure in coastal regions.",,,,,,,,,13,0,0,0,8,1,13,,,0143-1161,,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Calif Irvine, Dept Ecol & Evolut Biol, Irvine, CA 92697 USANatl Ctr Atmospher Res, Boulder, CO 80307 USA",,,,2001-07-20,WOS:000169546300002,,

Human-nature relationship: associations with the term nature (open mentions); attitude towards nature and nature conservation in general (it makes me happy to be in nature, I dont feel good in nature, I am annoyed by the careless way many people treat nature, nature conservation as a duty of man, nature must not stand in the way of economic development, we must only use nature in such a way that this is also possible to the same extent for future generations, in times of economic crisis nature conservation must also manage with less money, the wilder nature, the better I like it, nature conservation is necessary to meet the challenges of climate change). 4. Genetic engineering: attitude towards genetic engineering (trust in scientists when they confirm the safety of the new genetic engineering methods, long-term consequences of the new genetic engineering methods are not yet foreseeable, animals and plants from the wild should not be deliberately genetically modified, possible effects on nature should always be investigated when plants are genetically modified with the new methods); importance of banning the use of genetically modified organisms in agriculture; opinion on the issue of genetic engineering in agriculture (demand for labelling of food from animals fed with genetically modified food, have no problem eating genetically modified food, genetic engineering in agriculture is an important component in the fight against world hunger). 5. Energy transition: Advocacy of the energy transiition; assessment of the changes to the landscape in the course of the energy transiition due to the possible increase in wind turbines on land, out at sea and on the North Sea and Baltic Sea coasts, logging in forests, areas under maize cultivation, areas under rape cultivation, the number of high-voltage power lines, the number of lines laid as underground cables, the number of biogas plants, solar plants on meadows and fields, and solar plants on and on buildings; attitude towards the energy transition (the energy transition in Germany is a real community project, the energy transition distinguishes us in Germany from other countries, necessary to counter climate change, necessary to make Germany less dependent on importing energy and energy sources from other countries). 6. Biological diversity: awareness of the term biological diversity; personal meaning of the term biological diversity; convinced that biological diversity on earth is decreasing; preservation of biological diversity as a priority social task; willingness to do various things to protect biological diversity (change the brand of cosmetics or drugstore articles if their production endangers biological diversity, donate to the care and preservation of a protected area, actively participate in a nature conservation association, use a guidebook when shopping, e.g. informing about endangered fish species, making friends and acquaintances aware of biodiversity protection, informing about current developments in the field of biodiversity); attitude towards biodiversity (scale: personally perceived responsibility for the conservation of biological diversity, demand for a reduction in the use of land for settlements, industry and transport routes, promotes my well-being and quality of life, financial support for the efforts of poorer countries to conserve biological diversity by richer countries, personally perceived impairment by declining biological diversity, climate change threatens biological diversity). 7. Digitalisation: opinion on opportunities and risks of digitalisation in general; rather more opportunities vs. more risks of digitalisation for nature conservation; nature conservation should try to use the opportunities of digitalisation more for itself; use of an app is conceivable that informs about nature threats, successes of nature conservation or personal possibilities of action for nature. 8. Behavioural measure donation scale: Willingness to donate to nature conservation measures in a protected area in Germany in the event of winning 100 euros; decision on the donation amount and the concrete use of the donation (species and habitat protection directly on site, internet information to reach more people and nature experience and recreation for people); voluntary arbitrary division of the donation between the three measures mentioned. Demography: sex; age; nationality German; other nationality mentioned; employment status; occupation if not employed; education: school or university degree; religiosity; religion or denomination; household size; total number of children; household net income (grouped); urbanisation level at time of childhood and adolescence. Additionally coded were: Respondent ID; total interview duration in seconds; start time; weight; respective donation percentage grouped and mean percentage; federal state; city size category (BIK 5, 7 and 10 categories); county code.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2022-07-18,DRCI:DATA2022105024453301,,

However, multiple controls on ET at coastal ecosystems that are subject to subdaily tidal flooding have not yet received attention. In this study, we investigated the response of ET to meteorological variables including photosynthetically active radiation (PAR), air temperature (T-a), vapour pressure deficit (VPD), and wind speed (WS) under semidiurnal tidal influence from hourly to seasonal timescales, on the basis of 3-year eddy-covariance (EC) measurements over a tidal salt marsh ecosystem of the Yangtze Delta. Our results show that, as with most terrestrial ecosystems, PAR is a major control on ET in this coastal salt marsh ecosystem at hourly, diel, and multiday timescales. However, the semidiurnal tides co-control ET with meteorological variables, forming a complex ET pattern at the hourly and subdaily scales. In the daytime, ET was primarily driven by PAR and VPD, whereas during the night, WS and friction velocity dominated the ET variability. We also found that wind direction fundamentally changed the nature of the interactions of ET with other variables. Moreover, tidal inundation suppressed ET and changed its sensitivities to PAR, T-a, VPD, and WS, a process that was especially obvious when offshore winds prevailed. The tidal flooding can affect ET directly through altering surface energy partitioning or plant metabolic activity, and indirectly through influencing meteorological conditions such as T-a and VPD. By explicitly considering the influence of tidal dynamics, this study revealed the significance in quantifying the ET contributions in coastal ecosystems to global water, carbon and energy cycles.",,,,,,,,,12,2,0,0,8,0,12,,,0168-1923,1873-2240,,,,,,,,,,"East China Normal Univ, Inst Ecochongming, State Key Lab Estuarine & Coastal Res, Shanghai, Peoples R ChinaFudan Univ, Key Lab Biodivers Sci & Ecol Engn, Minist Educ, Shanghai, Peoples R ChinaChinese Acad Sci, Inst Tibetan Plateau Res, Key Lab Tibetan Environm Changes & Land Surface P, Beijing, Peoples R ChinaUniv Twente, Fac Geoinformat Sci & Earth Observat, Enschede, NetherlandsMarine Biol Lab, Ctr Ecosyst, Woods Hole, MA 02543 USA",,,,2019-12-16,WOS:000500197400040,,

A transect of sediment surface pollen samples retrieved from the Namaqualand mudbelt from just south of the Orange River mouth (29°S) to St Helena Bay (33°S) indicates distinctive pollen spectra reflecting vegetation communities on the adjacent continent. Pollen concentration increases southwards, partly in relation to greater pollen productivity due to higher biomass and density of fynbos vegetation and of sedimentary processes and low pollen concentrations consequent to dilution with silt and clay from the Orange River. The distribution of specific pollen taxa suggests that the Orange River is a major contributor of pollen to the northern mudbelt declining southwards, while the pollen distribution in the central mudbelt is largely attributable to seasonal inputs of pollen from offshore berg winds and local ephemeral Namaqualand rivers. The typical fynbos elements dominate in the southern mudbelt indicating a pollen source mainly in the fynbos vegetation types. These conclusions support a companion analysis of fossil pollen records of two marine sediment cores from the northern and southern mudbelt respectively. This study demonstrates that pollen records from marine sediment cores in the Namaqualand mudbelt have the potential to be a tool to reconstruct palaeovegetation on the adjacent continent. However, to better reconstruct the palaeoclimate of South Africa and fully understand the relations between terrestrial and marine deposits, more marine surface sediments along the western coast of South Africa as well as more terrestrial surface sediments need to be studied.

Currently, Montastraea annularis populations are suffering from high partial mortality rates; yet few studies have determined type, frequency and intensity of natural lesions in situ. During a year we followed natural lesions that appeared on healthy ramets of a population on a degraded reef within a Marine Protected Area in Colombia, to infer the effect oil population size structure. From September 2003 to September 2004, 94% of the ramets presented lesions caused by bleaching, predation; or algae, sponge and borrower interactions. Predation caused 47% of the lesions and algae 36%; most lesions (85%) were small (<5cm(2)), although some were bigger than 60cm(2) (0.3%). Lesion recovery was high (83%), but 11.2% did not recover or grow. On 2.5% algae invasion was seen. Bleaching lesions affected more ramet area (>60% of its live tissue) and were evident from September to November, yet total recovery was found in three months. In contrast, lesions by algae (36%), showed less recovery (6.7%), and a tendency to grow in time. In general, percentage of affected tissue area of a ramet in any month was lower than 10%. Nevertheless from May to September, the area affected was larger (10-50%) due to an increase in frequency and abundance of predation, bleaching and algal damage, and a decrease in recovery. At the end of the year, lesions that did not recover caused partial mortality in 25% of the ramets.

Pellets of three plastic polymers [low-density polyethylene (LDPE), high-density polyethylene (HDPE) and high-impact polystyrene (HIPS)] were deployed at Heron Island in the Great Barrier Reef, Australia, for up to 8 months. Detected AhR-mediated potencies (bio-TEQs) of extracted plastic pellets ranged from 15 to 100 pg/g. Contributions of target HOCs to the overall bioactivities were negligible. To identify the major contributors, remaining plastic pellets were used for fractionation with a gas chromatography (GC) fractionation platform featuring parallel mass spectrometric (MS) detection. The bioassay analysis showed two bioactive fractions of each polymer with bio-TEQs ranging from 5.7 to 14 pg/g. High resolution MS was used in order to identify bioactive compounds in the fractions. No AhR agonists could be identified in fractions of HDPE or LDPE.

These structures have significant bending stiffness combined with significant self-weight so that the axial force varies greatly from one end to the other and may even change sign. Such structures form key components of drilling and production platforms used for exploitation of hydrocarbons under the world's oceans. An understanding of their structural behaviour under reduced tension offers opportunities for cost reduction and further optimization, The buckling behaviour at low tension is evaluated by retaining nonlinear curvature terms and using an expansion in series to reduce the governing equation to a set of linear ordinary differential equations, which are then solved sequentially by employing Galerkin's technique. This approach is also extended to lateral oscillation of the structure when excited by forced horizontal oscillatory motions at the top end. The paper uses these solution techniques to explore the behaviour at low tension of typical slender structures used in offshore developments.",,,,,,,,,7,1,0,0,0,1,7,,,1364-503X,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1996-03-15,WOS:A1996UD25300006,,

Replacement of deep water within McBeth Fiord by water from the Baffin Shelf can also introduce shelf sediment to the fiord and cause the resuspension of sediment covering the outer sill complex. Alternatively, strong onshore winds can push the surface layer to the head of the fiord and significantly increase the surface layer volume of the inner fiord.

Successional changes in the microbial community structure due to the oil contamination were determined by deep sequencing of 16S rRNA genes. Metatranscriptomics was used to determine expression of functional genes involved in hydrocarbon degradation processes. In addition, potential hydrocarbon-degrading Bacteria were obtained in culture. The 16S data revealed that highly contaminated samples had higher abundances of Alpha- and Gammaproteobacteria sequences. Successional changes in these classes were observed over time, during which the oil was partially degraded. The metatranscriptome data revealed that PAH, n-alkane, and toluene degradation genes were expressed in the contaminated samples, with high homology to genes from Alteromonadales, Rhodobacterales, and Pseudomonales. Notably, Marinobacter (Gammaproteobacteria) had the highest representation of expressed genes in the samples.

Participants expressed a stronger preference for demand-side options than for supply-side ones. They also chose fuel switching (to electricity) and technical energy efficiency measures above more behaviour focused options. Renewable energy options (wind, solar, marine and hydro) were preferred to other low carbon supply options (nuclear power, carbon capture and storage), with offshore wind power more popular than onshore. Nuclear power was the least popular generation option. Acceptability of the government's three proposed scenarios was tested by comparing these scenarios with the research findings. Greatest support was suggested for the two scenarios emphasising business greenness, home energy efficiency, electrification of home heating and travel behaviour. The lowest level of support was demonstrated for the scenario based on significant growth in nuclear power with minimal increases in energy efficiency. Despite issues regarding the representivity of the sampled respondents, the work demonstrates the possibility of using outputs from the tool to assess publically preferred pathways.

The working principle of tidal energy conversion system (TECS) is to use the potential and kinetic energy of the ocean waves caused by the celestial gravitation to drive the turbine that is coupled with a generator to produce electricity.However, due to the physical structure of the generator, the power output is closely related with water speed, direction, load amount, etc., which show highly non-linear characteristics. The water speed and direction of the tidal stream are closely related to the moon phase, which can be considered as deterministic factor. However, there are non-deterministic factors such as sea habitat migration, seaweed entanglement, bio-foiling, etc. that can make the power output sub-optimal.

Sulfur adsorbed on particulate matter in exhaust gases from fuels is generally considered to be sulfate. However, other chemical species of sulfur adsorbed on particulate matter in ship exhaust gases are not well known. The purpose of this study is to identify sulfur species adsorbed on particulate matter in ship exhaust gases using X-ray absorption fine structure. Particulate matter and soot samples were collected from a container carrier, a tugboat, an electric propulsion vessel, training vessels, and a marine engine, and sulfur species of particulate matter and soot were identified by X-ray absorption fine structure analysis. Sulfur emission adsorbed on particulate matter and sulfur species did not change between high and middle loads. In this study, sulfonate derived from fuel or oxidation of sulfide in fuel was identified in addition to sulfate. Total sulfur and sulfate concentrations in soot increased with increasing fuel sulfur content. The concentration of organosulfurorganosulfurs in soot such as thiophen and sulfonate, which originated mainly from fuel and engine oil, tended to increase with increasing fuel sulfur content.

Fatty acid composition of total body lipid, phospholipid, and neutral lipid of whole snail and total lipid of their algal food were analyzed by capillary gas chromatography and gas chromatographymass spectrometry. The most abundant fatty acids were C16:0, C18:0, C16:1 omega 7, C18:1 omega 9, C18:2 omega 6, and C18:3 omega 3 acids in the lipid analyses of the snail and in its food. Odd-numbered fatty acids and C20 polyunsaturated fatty acid structures were confirmed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Some differences were found in the percentages of phospholipid and neutral, total, and algal lipid. It is proposed that possible seasonal variations in the snail lipids are related to temperature: a positive correlation between the level of Sigma SFA (total saturated fatty acid:;) in total body lipid, phospholipid, and neutral lipid fractions of the snail and temperature was observed, whereas Sigma MUFA (total monounsaturated fatty acids) levels were negatively related with temperature. On the other hand, there were fluctuations in the concentrations of Sigma PUFA (total polyunsaturated fatty acids) in all analyses.

This paper defines a systematic approach to quantifying the UK marine economy, aiming to capture all activities in the market economy that occur within and depend upon UK marine and coastal environments, and estimates its contribution to the UK economy as a whole. The approach draws on previous research in this area and links sectors used in marine planning with the methodologies used in national accounts. The results suggest that the marine economy contributes double the amount of previous estimates to the UK economy. Changes in the structure of the marine economy, partly due to the expansion of offshore wind energy, may affect its economic contribution. The results also show that marine and coastal leisure and recreation sectors, which were previously thought to have a small economic contribution, are the second largest sector in the UK marine economy and account for the largest number of jobs. By dis-aggregating the economic sectors, the approach used here can underpin a marine natural capital approach, enabling economic activities to be linked with aspects of marine natural capital.",,,,,,,,,31,2,0,0,9,0,34,,,0308-597X,1872-9460,,,,,,,,,,"Plymouth Marine Lab, Prospect Pl, Plymouth, Devon, EnglandUniv Exeter, Environm & Sustainabil Inst, Penryn, Cornwall, EnglandUniv West England, Dept Accounting Econ & Finance, Frenchay Campus,Coldharbour Lane, Bristol, Avon, England",,,,2020-05-21,WOS:000531028400026,,

Statistical associations were studied between the symbionts and helminths of F. duorarum and pollutants in sediments, water and shrimps in Campeche Sound, Mexico. The study area spatially overlapped between offshore oil platforms and natural shrimp mating grounds. Spatial autocorrelation of data was controlled with spatial analysis using distance indices (SADIE) which identifies parasite or pollutant patches (high levels) and gaps (low levels), expressing them as clustering indices compared at each point to produce a measure of spatial association. Symbionts included the peritrich ciliates Epistylis sp. and Zoothamnium penaei and all symbionts were pooled. Helminths included Hysterothylacium sp., Opecoeloides fimbriatus, Prochristianella penaei and an unidentified cestode. Thirty-five pollutants were identified, including polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), pesticides and heavy metals. The PAHs (2-3 ring) in water, unresolved complex mixture (UCM), Ni and V in sediments, and Zn, Cr and heptachlor in shrimps were significantly clustered. The remaining pollutants were randomly distributed in the study area. Juvenile shrimps acquired pesticides, PAHs (2-3 rings) and Zn, while adults acquired PAHs (4-5 rings), Cu and V. Results suggest natural PAH spillovers, and continental runoff of dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT), PCBs and PAHs (2-3 ring). There were no significant associations between pollutants and helminths. However, there were significant negative associations of pesticides, UCM and PCBs with symbiont numbers after controlling shrimp size and spatial autocorrelation.

Consequently, there has been a growing interest in UUV research among scientific and engineering communities. Although UUVs have received significant research interest in recent years, limited attention has been paid towards design and development of mini/micro UUVs (usually less than 1 foot in length). Micro unmanned underwater vehicles (mu UUVs) are particularly attractive for deployment in extraordinarily confined spaces such as inspection of intricate underwater structures, ship wrecks, oil pipe lines or extreme hazardous areas. This paper considers previous work done in the field of miniature UUVs and presents an optimization framework for preliminary design of that class of UUVs. A state-of-the-art optimization algorithm namely infeasibility driven evolutionary algorithm (IDEA) is used to carry out optimization of the mu UUV designs. The framework is subsequently used to identify optimal design of a torpedo-shaped mu UUV with an overall length of six inches (152.4 mm). The preliminary design identified through the process of optimization is further analyzed with the help of a computer-aided design tool to come up with a detailed design.

In winter, shelf waters tend to overturn vertically due to tidal circulation and Ekman convergence of outer-shelf waters driven by southerly winds. From 9 November 2005 to 22 June 2006 the shelf off Santa Catarina State was surveyed to investigate hydrographic conditions and the seasonal dynamics of the plankton cross-shelf distribution and community structure. A strong wind-driven onshore bottom intrusion of the SACW with the formation of two independent deep chlorophyll maximum (DCM) layers on the shelf was clear. Chlorophyll concentrations ranged from 0.07 to 6.2 mg m(-3) and phytoplankton carbon biomass from 0.2 to 511 mu gC L-1, mostly as large centric diatoms and in spite of the numerical dominance of small pennates. The mid-shelf DCM was 12 m thick between 38 and 50 m (1-5% of irradiance) with mean chlorophyll concentrations up to 1.8 mg m(-3). The DCM on the outer shelf was formed between 60 and 70 m depth (1-0.01% surface light) by small pennate diatoms and small phytoflagellates, with chlorophyll concentrations of 0.5-0.7 mg m(-3). Both DCMs were maintained independently from January to April 2006, and dispersed in June due to water column turnover during cold seasons. In the mid-shelf, the DCM was geographically extended towards the inner shelf and became thicker compared to pre- and post-intrusion periods. The freshwater species Aulacoseira granulata and large centric diatoms including the invasive Coscinodiscus wailesii were frequent along the shelf throughout the sampling period. Oncaea waldemari, Ctenocalanus vanus and Oithona plumifera usually dominated the zooplankton, which ranged from 23 to 7970 individuals m(-3). Abundances were always higher on the inner shelf regardless of the season of the year. Abundance on the mid-shelf peaked following the onset of the intrusion of the nutrient-rich oceanic SACW in the lower euphotic zone and the enhancement of the DCM. A 6-step circulation model of diatoms coupled with shelf hydrodynamics is proposed as the main mechanism of retention of diatoms in the shelf system. The model suggests that diatoms resuspended in the nearshore are transported offshore by Ekman forces toward oligotrophic waters, where they sink faster due to poor nutrient conditions. Sinking cells find better nutrient conditions in the pycnocline/nutricline layers, become shade-adapted and increase their buoyancy, contributing to the formation of the DCM. Resting cells sinking out of the euphotic zone reach near-bottom layers or the sediments, from where they are carried back onshore by oceanic intrusions of the SACW. We suggest how this hydrodynamic circulation pattern of diatoms may take place in other subtropical shelf systems dominated by western boundary currents. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

This SAC extends from the inner firths to Helmsdale on the north coast and Lossiemouth on the south coast, and includes areas that are regularly used by the population of bottlenose dolphins occurring along the east coast of Scotland. As a result of this designation, Scottish Natural Heritage (SNH) has a responsibility to report on the condition of bottlenose dolphins within the Moray Firth SAC every six years. Since 1989, this population of bottlenose dolphins has been the focus of an intensive research programme, carried out by the University of Aberdeen in collaboration with the Sea Mammal Research Unit at the University of St Andrews. In 2004, SNH entered into a Memorandum of Agreement with the University of Aberdeen to support these photo-identification studies and use the data to report on the condition of the site. This report presents the results from the fourth round of SNH funded surveys, together with the results of similar surveys made in 2011 and 2012 that were carried out with support from the Department of Energy and Climate Change (DECC), Scottish Government, Oil & Gas UK and Collaborative Offshore Wind Research Into the Environment (UK) (COWRIE). This is an interim report to provide updates on the monitoring programme in the three years since the last report. The next full site condition monitoring report is due in 2018. Main findings Mark-recapture analysis of photographs collected during photo-identification surveys indicated that an estimated 102 individual dolphins used the SAC during the summer of 2011, 112 in 2012 and 94 in 2013. Despite inter-annual variability, the number of dolphins using the SAC between 1990 and 2013 appears to be stable. Passive acoustic monitoring from 2011 to 2013 highlighted that there was some inter-annual and seasonal variation in the amount of time dolphins spent at sample sites within the SAC. However, dolphins were present at two long-term monitoring sites in the SAC on almost all days during the summer. Subject to available data we aim to update estimates of overall population size for the full site condition monitoring report due in 2018. These data will also be used to assess any changes in the proportion of the total population using the SAC. The quality of data available for completing the Site Attribute Table is high for attribute 1.1.1, medium for attribute 1.1.2 and low for attribute 1.1.3. As a result of this and in light of the limited years of data collected since the last full assessment, we recommend that no change is made to the condition status as a result of this report.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,1759-4014,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2014-01-01,ZOOREC:ZOOR15307045726,,

The CCE site, building upon 60 years of extensive time-series measurements by CalCOFI, seeks to understand the mechanisms underlying transitions between different states of this ecosystem, as well as their corollary: ecosystem resilience. In the first phase of CCE funding investigators at this site uncovered a new climate mode for the North Pacific (NPGO); found marked differences in food web structure between the offshore wind stress curl and the classical coastal boundary upwelling domains; detected long-term changes in gelatinous grazers (pelagic tunicates), optical properties, nitracline depths, prevalence of hypoxia, stratification, and other ecosystem characteristics; revealed zones of iron and iron-light co-limitation of primary production; developed a ROMS model and used it in hindcast mode to diagnose causality of ecosystem transitions and forecast mode to guide Lagrangian process cruises; developed an allometric approach to food web modeling; discovered differences between physical and biotic time series in degree of nonlinearities; demonstrated the destabilizing effects of fishing; initiated new data practices; and more. Findings from this first effort point to the importance of spatial structuring of the CCE, especially on the mesoscale. In this renewal the LTER investigators target mesoscale fronts and eddies, which constitute an important part of the CCE ecological disturbance regime. CCE Investigators have found that such features vary on interannual and decadal scales in the CCE region and they hypothesize that their variability over time may contribute to ecosystem transitions. This project will continue studies at the CCE LTER. The overarching questions posed in this next phase of the study are: What are the mechanisms leading to different states in a coastal pelagic ecosystem? What is the interplay between changing ocean climate, community structure and ecosystem dynamics? To address these questions, the investigators propose to examine 4 mechanisms that could contribute to ecosystem transitions: anomalous alongshore advection; in situ food web changes in response to stratification and nutrient supply; changes in cross-shore transport; and altered predation pressure. They will also test 3 hypotheses related to the role of mesoscale processes, specifically concerning their role in altering nutrient fluxes and predator-prey interactions, the integrated biogeochemical effects of mesoscale fronts and eddies over the CCE region and the relationship of such features to larger scale climate variability. A combination of Lagrangian process cruises, experimental work, time series measurements, modeling, data synthesis, and a coupled human-natural system study will be used to address these questions. The project will also continue to measure the 5 LTER core variables. Broader Impacts: Notable among the ecosystem services furnished by the coastal ocean off southern California is the region?s importance for spawning and/or harvesting of many commercially important fishes and marine invertebrates. This research will provide a key scientific foundation for understanding time and space variability of properties relevant to ecosystem-based fisheries management. This information is essential as managers begin to address the consequences of changing ocean acidity, stratification, and hypoxia for resource populations and communities. ISSE (Integrated Science for Society and the Environment) studies will partner an economist, graduate student, and scientists in the development of a bioeconomic model to examine the interplay between ecosystem variability and fishers? decision-making and resource allocation. In addition, the CCE Investigators will further develop and enhance DataZoo, the information system central to our Information Management and data sharing environment. They will implement new web-accessible tools to facilitate data visualization and communication of CCE results to students, teachers across all levels, scientists, managers, policy-makers, and the broader public. An Education, Outreach, and Capacity Building (EOCB) program will include a vigorous program of involvement of tens of graduate students in site science and communication. A graduate student will serve as a research liaison with the EOCB coordinator, to help translate CCE science into K-12 lesson plans. CCE LTER will work with local teachers in a diverse urban school district to bring CCE science into the classroom, and will continue outreach and coastal ocean time series activities with the nonprofit Ocean Institute. This LTER site will expand their successful RET and Teacher-at-Sea programs, to enable teachers to communicate the process of science inquiry directly to students. Their REU program will continue targeting under-represented undergraduates to expand the pipeline into the ocean sciences.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,1026607,,,,,,,,University of California-San Diego Scripps Inst of Oceanography,,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:14007277,,

We present different techniques in order to relate the shape of the multifractal spectral functions and the maximum fractal dimension to the behaviour of the ocean surface. We compare eddy and sheared dominated flows with convective driven flows and discuss the different features and observation methods. We also compare the scaling of different oil spills detected by means of SAR images. Recent spills and weathered ones are selected and compared to investigate their behaviour in different spatial and temporal ranges. We calculate the partition function based on the grey intensity value of each SAR pixel deriving several types of multifractal spectra as a function of spill residence time estimated for each image. Image manipulations are seen to reduce the speckle noise and thus distinguish much better the texture of the oil spill images. The results are used to discuss how eddy diffusivity may be estimated and used in a description of the ocean surface using a simple turbulence kinematic simulation model to predict the shape of oil spills.

Sustainable improvements in water quality by the reduction of phosphorus (P) supplies will take several decades before giving full effects because of large P storages both in soils in the watershed and in the water column and bottom sediments of the Baltic proper. In this article it is shown that drastically improved water quality may be obtained within a few years using large-scale ecological engineering methods. Natural variations in the Baltic proper during the last decades have demonstrated how rapid improvements may be achieved. The present article describes the basic dynamics of P, organic matter, and oxygen in the Baltic proper. It also briefly discusses the advantages and disadvantages of different classes of methods of ecological engineering aimed at restoring the Baltic proper from eutrophication effects. Preliminary computations show that the P content might be halved within a few years if about 100 kg O-2 s(-1) are supplied to the upper deepwater. This would require 100 pump stations, each transporting about 100 m(3) s(-1) of oxygen-rich so-called winter water from about 50 to 125 m depth where the water is released as a buoyant jet. Each pump station needs a power supply of 0.6 MW. Offshore wind power technology seems mature enough to provide the power needed by the pump stations.

The amplitudes of surge, sway and heave motions excited by vortex-induced vibration (VIV) in wave-current conditions can be reduced up to 50%.

The objective of this research project is to better understand the interactions between a tidal turbine and the surrounding fluid environment. Tidal turbines are a relatively new class of renewable energy devices that convert the motion of flowing water in rivers or tides into energy. This research is focused on addressing several outstanding scientific challenges that need to be overcome so that these novel devices can be developed and deployed. In addition to the scientific discoveries, the educational component of this research project involves training the next generation of engineers and professionals through research, teaching, and outreach activities. The outreach component involves partnering with Lehigh University?s Office of Outreach and Northampton Community College in the STAR (Students That Are Ready) program, which targets economically and academically disadvantaged and/or at-risk 8th to 12th grade students. The social impact of the long-term success of tidal turbine technology is significant. In addition to the continental United States, commercialization of these technologies may directly impact a major fraction of the world population as the majority of large population centers are located either close to major rivers or coastlines. The experimental design in this research project is motivated by the need to couple near and far wake physics to turbine performance at elevated levels of free-stream turbulence. Turbulence generation techniques using active grids are being used to mimic hydraulic and natural in-stream conditions. Diagnostics include a reaction torque-thrust sensor for system analysis and time-resolved stereo particle image velocimetry for flow-field measurements. A detailed understanding of the evolution of the wake is vital when considering design of a tidal farm (similar to wind farms). Designing an optimal farm layout in rivers is challenging as the useful zone for power extraction may be restricted to a small footprint due to navigational requirements. Existing engineering analysis do not fully capture the non-linear interactions that arise due to such closely packed layouts or the associated environmental impact. To enhance the scientific impact, the new data sets are being made available to the scientific community to allow validation and verification of advanced computational fluid dynamics models of flow around tidal turbines.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,1706358,,,,,,,,Lehigh University,,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:13930830,,

While the parts produced with this material are durable and lightweight, the increase in CFRP composite material usage requires the development of processing methods with low cost and high quality. The surface quality in milling of CFRP composite materials is an important issue due to the influence of surface quality of the produced parts on the assemblage. It has also importance on the fatigue resistance of the machined parts. On the other hand, CFRP composite material is seen as one of the hard-to-cut materials due to its low thermal conductivity and abrasive nature. Rapid tool wear occurring during the milling process deteriorates the surface quality, leads to the decline in production due to the machine tool downtime and it thereby causes a cost increase accordingly. Therefore, diamond tools are widely used in machining of CFRP composite material due to their high hardness, while these tools are expensive. In order to overcome the tool cost issue, cemented carbide tools are used to cut CFRP composite material. Although carbide tools have higher toughness than diamond ones, their hardness is low. Therefore, they are commonly protected by a hard coating to increase their surface hardness and wear resistance. However, the tool life and cutting performance of the carbide tools in machining of CFRP material need to be improved. In this study, after investigation the studies on milling process of CFRP composite materials in the current literature, the emerging developments were presented. Cutting tool geometry and materials used in the relevant area are compiled. Tool wear mechanisms that occur during the milling process, the failures in CFRP composite material and the solutions to prevent these failures are discussed. (c) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Sampling was conducted from April 1994 to December 1995. Large individuals dominated the size structure of this population. The modal class in the size frequency distribution of males was larger than that of females. Dorsal oval length (DOL) was 14 and 13 mm for males and females respectively, while the maximum DOL was very similar, 14.6 mm in males and 14.5 mm in females. Sex ratio was strongly skewed toward females (1:2.5) in adults, while was close to 1:1 in juveniles. Growth was initially rapid and maturation size (10.3 mm) was attained in both sexes within one year after hatching. In adults, growth was slower and a life span of at least four years was estimated for both sexes. The molting cycle of males was correlated with water temperature (external stimulus), while that of females was correlated with proportion of ovigerous individuals (intrinsic factor). Ovarian development intensified between late winter and early spring (August-September). This was followed by increasing proportions of ovigerous females with peaks in December, in both 1994 and 1995.

In this study, shell is taken as a biomimetic object, which has ribbed surfaces and antifouling properties. On the premise of antifouling, the microstructures of the shell surface are simplified as ribbed surfaces with an interval w between neighboring riblets. The impact of the riblet interval w on drag reduction performance is studied both numerically and experimentally. The numerical simulation adopts the Shear Stress Transport k - omega turbulence model, and the characteristics of smooth and ribbed surfaces are analyzed in the same computational domain.

OTUs affiliated with known (Pseudomonas) and potential (Marinomonas) hydrocarbon-degraders were roughly twice as abundant in biofilms treated with oil and dispersed oil, and steel corrosion of CSDs in these treatments was higher compared to control and dispersant treatments. OTUs affiliated with the Rhodobacteraceae family (biofilm formers and potential oil degraders) were less abundant in the dispersant treatment compared to other treatments in biofilm and SW samples, but OTUs affiliated with the Pseudoalteromonas genus (biofilm formers and proposed hydrocarbon degraders) were more abundant in dispersant-treated biofilms. Overall, functional gene analyses revealed a decrease in genes (predicted using PICRUSt and observed in sequenced metagenomes) associated with hydrocarbon degradation in dispersant-treated biofilms. This study indicates that exposure to oil and dispersant could disrupt the composition and metabolic function of biofilms colonizing metal hulls, as well as corrosion processes, potentially compromising shipwrecks as ecological and historical resources.",,,,,,,,,21,0,0,0,15,0,21,,,,2296-7745,,,,,,,,,,"George Mason Univ, Environm Sci & Policy Dept, Fairfax, VA 22030 USANaval Res Lab, Hancock Cty, MS USAUniv Southern Mississippi, Sch Ocean Sci & Technol, Div Coastal Sci, Ocean Springs, MS 39564 USA",,,,2019-02-13,WOS:000457156700001,,

The new sampler utilizes a syringe-like titanium sampling bottle with a regulated filling rate to collect samples. The filling rate regulation mechanism of the new sampler was studied. Through theoretical analysis and simulation, it is found that the filling rate can be regulated by either an orifice or an annular gap on the sampler. Further study indicates that the orifice is superior to the annular gap, since the former has a much lower requirement of machining accuracy. Moreover, the filling rate regulated by the orifice is independent of temperature and ambient pressure. The new sampler also features a compact structure, simple operation, and gas-tight performance. Efforts were made to minimize the organic carbon blank of the sampler by careful selection of the materials that may come into contact with the fluid samples.

Overall AOT in tropical IO is significantly smaller than those in SCS, and a strong intraseasonal variability of AOT, along with significant dependence on wind speed (especially when <8m s(-1)), is observed in both basins. Our analysis showed that in tropical IO, aerosols are mostly of natural marine production in spring, and the AOT shows greater dependence on the higher wind speeds in May, while in SCS, AOT dependence on wind speed increases when the prevailing wind turns from offshore (February, March) to onshore (April, May), due to less transport of terrestrial dust and anthropogenic aerosols from land. A better agreement between shipboard and once-daily satellite AOT is observed in the Equatorial belt (5 degrees S-5 degrees N, i.e. remote areas of IO) than in the Non-Equatorial area (5 degrees N-25 degrees N), and can be explained by the overall lower AOT values and the smaller diurnal variation in the Equatorial belt. Changes of wind regime during the monsoon evolution and the consequent transport of land-based aerosols reduce AOT dependence on wind speed and are the major drivers for the AOT variability.",,,,,13th Biennial Pan Ocean Remote Sensing Conference (PORSEC)13th Biennial Pan Ocean Remote Sensing Conference (PORSEC),"NOV 08-11, 2016NOV 08-11, 2016",,"Fortaleza, BRAZILFortaleza, BRAZIL",3,0,0,0,0,0,3,,,0143-1161,1366-5901,,,,,,,,,,"State Ocean Adm, South China Sea Inst Planning & Environm Res, Guangzhou, Guangdong, Peoples R ChinaChinese Acad Sci, South China Sea Inst Oceanol, State Key Lab Trop Oceanog LTO, Guangdong Key Lab Ocean Remote Sensing LORS, Guangzhou, Guangdong, Peoples R ChinaCollaborat Innovat Ctr 21st Century Maritime Silk, Guangzhou, Guangdong, Peoples R ChinaNorthWest Res Associates, Seattle, WA USA",State Ocean AdmCollaborat Innovat Ctr 21st Century Maritime Silk,,,2018-09-13,WOS:000442287300017,,

The aim of this study was to investigate whether 226Ra in sediment would accumulate in and affect sediment-dwelling organisms. In addition, we wanted to determine if the bioavailability would be modulated by the presence of a scale inhibitor which is used during oil and gas production. Hediste diversicolor was therefore exposed to different levels of Ra-226 (30-6600 Bq kg(-1)) in combination with scale inhibitor in the sediments in a flow through system. The levels of radioactivity in the exposures were close to levels that can be measured in proximity to oil/gas production facilities. Ra-226 spiked to natural sediment partitioned into pore water and accumulated in the sediment-dwelling polychaete following a four-week exposure period. The results suggest that 226Ra did not bind strongly to sediment (low sediment:water partitioning coefficient), but it was not shown to bioaccumulate in any great extent (bioaccumulation factors of 0.019-0.022). Exposure of H. diversicolor in sediments with up to 6600 Bq kg(-1) Ra-226 had no measurable effect on the total oxyradical scavenging capacity of the organisms compared to control.

The analysis was carried out for the winter and annual periods and proved the existence of a marked influence of the NAO pattern on the spatial and temporal variability of the solar and wind energy resources in the study area. Particularly, the NAO signature on the solar/wind energy resources was found to be a north-south dipolar pattern, with the positive/negative centre over the Mediterranean area. Although the spatial patterns obtained are similar, the nature of the relationship obtained for wind energy was found to be less linear and more complex than that attained for solar energy. A composite analysis revealed that interannual variability of the solar and wind energy resources in the Mediterranean area can reach values above 20% in winter and 10% in the annual case associated with changes in the NAO phase. Finally, the analysis of the spatial patterns of the NAO influence on the solar and wind energy resources revealed the existence of spatial and local balancing between these two energy resources in the study area.

To understand how the construction of an offshore windfarm in the Maryland Wind Energy Area (WEA) off Maryland, USA, might impact harbour porpoises (Phocoena phocoena), it is essential to determine their poorly understood year-round distribution. Although habitat-based models can help predict the occurrence of species in areas with limited or no sampling, they require validation to determine the accuracy of the predictions. Incorporating more than 18 months of harbour porpoise detection data from passive acoustic monitoring, generalized auto-regressive moving average and generalized additive models were used to investigate harbour porpoise occurrence within and around the Maryland WEA in relation to temporal and environmental variables. Acoustic detection metrics were compared to habitat-based density estimates derived from aerial and boat-based sightings to validate the model predictions. Harbour porpoises occurred significantly more frequently during January to May, and foraged significantly more often in the evenings to early mornings at sites within and outside the Maryland WEA. Harbour porpoise occurrence peaked at sea surface temperatures of 5°C and chlorophyll a concentrations of 4.5 to 7.4 mg m-3. The acoustic detections were significantly correlated with the predicted densities, except at the most inshore site. This study provides insight into previously unknown fine-scale spatial and temporal patterns in distribution of harbour porpoises offshore of Maryland. The results can be used to help inform future monitoring and mitigate the impacts of windfarm construction and other human activities.

Most efforts in Lithuania were aimed at developing biomass (wood chips, wood waste, straw, biogas) and small hydro projects and their subsequent implementation. At present the total installed capacity of wood fuelled boilers reached above 420 MW No serious obstacles can be seen for the extension of wood fuel usage. Prices of fuel market depend on local conditions, as well as on the number of fuel consumers, capacity of installed wood burning boilers, etc. Wood briquettes and pellets have been started to use in Lithuania since 1994 and 1999 respectively. There are about 16 organizations in Lithuania producing this kind of wood fuel.Annually in Lithuanian agriculture there comprises about 3.5-4.0 mln tons of straw. Major part of it is consumed for feeding animals, litter and olericulture. Only about 10-12% from the total amount of straw can be used for energy production. This would comprise about 130 ktne. The first boiler-houses, using straw fuel, were constructed in 1996. Later the number of these boiler-houses increased, therefore, for the moment the total installed capacity of straw firing boilers comprises about 7 MW.Sources of biogas production are comprised of waste water cleaning equipments' sludge, animals and birds' nuck and food companies' organic waste. For the moment biogas is produced in Kaunas and Utena towns waste water cleaning plants and demo biogas power plants in Lekeciai agriculture company. For the moment in Rokiskis cheese plant there is an operating biogas power plant with 2x900 m(3) digesters. For the moment total volume of operating digesters comprises about 24000 m(3), and annual production comprises about 6.3 mln m(3) of biogas per year, and this corresponds to 3.4 ktne. It is forecasted that in year 2010 total volume of bioreactors will increase up to 35000 m(3), while in year 2020 it will comprise 50000 m(3).Biofuels used for transport needs is comprised of bioethanol and biodiesel. Bioethanol is produced out of sugar,and starch materials. Rape-oil is used for biodiesel production. Biodiesel, as well as bioethanol, is mainly used in nixture with fuel, produced from oil. In Lithuania bioethanol is produced in Silute joint stock company Biofuure, while biodiesel in Mazeikiai enterprise Rapsoila. Following the requirements of EU, 7.2 thous tons of bioethanol and about 13.8 thousons of biodiesel or 2% of total amount of consumed fuel per year are to be produced. Up to year 2010 such fuel should comprise not less than 5.75% of all fuel consumed in the country.Lithuania has not good conditions for wind energy, because there is low wind speed. Wind speed is 5 -5.5 m/s at 10 m height in the coast zone. In the middle of Lithuania wind speed is 3.5 or 4 m/s. Measurement result, shows, that the chosen method of approximating wind observation results with use of Weibul's distributior functions is correct for various regions of Lithuania. Investigation shows that the Klaipeda region is the most. suitable one for construction of wind turbines, particularly its 10 km wide coastal strip. It is established, that at greatest wind velocity west direction prevails and at lowest wind velocity east direction prevails that is winds blow from continent side. Hence, to use wind energy in most efficient may it is expedient to build wind power plants as near sea as possible, even in the sea if possible. However, till 2010 in Lithuania there will be erected 180 MW capacities of wind turbines. The threshold, which can't be passed without capital reconstruction of electricity, network, is 500 MW capacities of wind turbines. The annual production will be about 0.9 TWh.Conventional solar thermal systems can be used more effectively for domestic hot water and space heating in Lithuania. It may be used in district and passive heating systems, production photovoltaic electricity and for the reduction of electricity for lighting.",,,,,Conference of the Lietuvos-Energetikos-Institutas 50Conference of the Lietuvos-Energetikos-Institutas 50,"NOV, 2006NOV, 2006",,LITHUANIALITHUANIA,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,978-9986-795-46-9,,,,,,,,,,,,,2006-01-01,WOS:000247301400013,,

A reliable means of delineating bird activity centers on the landscape has been a significant impediment to progress in proactive infrastructure planning. We used Brownian bridge movement modeling to develop a population-wide, utilization probability surface for bald eagles (Haliaeetus leucocephalus) within the upper Chesapeake Bay. We used locations (n=320,304) for individuals (n=63) tracked with global positioning system (GPS) satellite transmitters between 2007 and 2011 in the analysis. We intersected the electrical network on the probability surface within Aberdeen Proving Ground, a 350-km(2) military installation to identify overlap between power lines and eagle activity centers. We also overlaid locations of eagle mortalities attributed to the lines (n=67) on the installation to assess the relationship between mortality rates and utilization probabilities. Areas of high bald eagle use were relatively rare on the landscape with only 0.1% and 5% of the area accounting for 10% and 30% of estimated utilization. Most electric lines were along roads and distributed away from eagle activity centers, with only 0.3% of lines located within areas with the highest estimated eagle use. Eagle mortalities were highly skewed to lines that overlapped with eagle activity centers. Eagle mortality rates (birds/100km/yr) were 42 times higher along lines associated with the highest 10% of eagle use compared to lines associated with the lowest 10% use, suggesting that estimated utilization may be an effective proxy for mortality risk associated with electric line hazards. The majority (71.9%) of high-use bald eagle areas delineated within the study area have no existing electric lines. Utilization probabilities may be a potential tool for site-specific infrastructure planning.

Such support structures are driven into deposits of saturated granular soil, vulnerable to liquefaction under loadings of dynamic nature, e.g. earthquakes. Although numerous studies have been accomplished to obtain a comprehensive understanding of their performance during liquefaction, a conclusive study has not been presented for the specific case of large-diameter piles under a clay layer. This issue has great importance in the case of off shore wind turbines, since they are very sensitive to dynamic loadings. In this study, a 3D FEM model was constructed by OpenSeesPL to explore soil and pile responses throughout liquefaction. To capture the precise behavior, a constitutive law based on a multi-surface plasticity was utilized for soil. The described model used in this study is capable of accurate prediction of sand behavior in undrained conditions. Different scenarios were tested: variations in pile dimensions, loading frequency, and influence of clay layer. Sensitivity analyses show that loading frequency, presence of clay layer, and pile diameter could significantly affect the behavior of large-diameter piles in saturated soil conditions.

The linear substructures are subsequently described in their dominant dynamics and reassembled, allowing one to compute the coupled dynamic behavior. DS methods are often classified into two distinct families, the Frequency Based Substructuring (FBS) methods and Component Mode Synthesis (CMS) techniques. In the former substructures are assembled whose dynamics are described in terms of frequency response functions (FRFs) and the latter are used to reduce and assemble the substructure finite element (FE) models. Lately a new substructuring method has been proposed, one that does not fit the framework of the FBS and CMS methods. The method, named Impulse Based Substructuring (IBS), was first used to obtain the coupled response of a system by assembling its component impulse response functions (IRFs). In this paper the IBS method is extended, thereby allowing one to determine the coupled behavior of structures that are composed of both substructure FE models and substructure IRFs. The method can be regarded as an extension to the normal time integration methods used for obtaining the time responses of FE models. As the linear substructures (described in their IRFs) are fully condensed on the interface of the FE model, one can significantly reduce the computational cost required for time integrating otherwise large FE models. However, as the linear (IRF) domains are exactly accounted for, the IBS method can be seen as a dynamic condensation on the interface, but not as a reduction method in the classical sense. Nonetheless, one can regard IRFs as a sort of superelements in time and the IBS method can therefore serve as an attractive alternative to CMS methods in case these are not available in the applied FE modeling programs, or if a high spectral bandwidth of the substructure is required. The method proposed in this work is based on the generalized-cc time integration scheme and it is analytically proven that it can be applied in such a way that the simulation results are identical to the responses obtained from a monolithic integration of the full system, thereby guaranteeing its stability and accuracy. The method is demonstrated using a numerical test case, where a wind turbine FE model is coupled with a the IRFs of a marine foundation. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

J,,,,,,,,,"Lavrova,Olga",,Study of the influence of dynamic and circulation processes on the propagation of the anthropogenic and biogenic pollution of the sea surface based on the combined satellite information,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Awarded Grant,Jan 01 1800,2017,"The goal of the project is to develop and improve the techniques for the retrieval of parameters of sea surface pollution, investigate the impact of dynamic and circulation processes on pollution propagation and assess the ecological state of Russia's seas based on a combined analysis of satellite data, and this goal links the proposed project to Project 2014. The relevance of estimating the ecological state of the seas bordering Russia is not simply maintained but continuously rising. There are many reasons for that. Risk of oil pollution increases with the expansion of oil and gas industry, construction of new underwater pipelines and growth of ship traffic. Increased concentration of suspended matter in water leads to higher water turbidity and lower biological productivity. Anomalous algae blooming lasts longer and covers greater areas year-to-year and occurs in regions never affected before. Expanding domestic tourism and marine recreation industry increase risk of anthropogenic pollution of coastal waters. Today, given global and regional climate change, these factors appear hazardous for previously unaffected marine environments, in particular, the coastal zones of the Arctic seas, which more often and for longer time remain iceless. There is a need for detailed near-real-time information on spatial and temporal distribution of meso- and submesoscale processes (eddies, eddy dipoles, jets, fronts and internal waves) in various regions. Complex current structures associated with these phenomena appear at the sea surface and may be captured by remote sensing sensors from space. In the course of Project 2014, new tasks to achieve the goal of Project 2017 have emerged. Note, that it was possible to formulate the new tasks largely due the appearance of new satellite data advancing the quality of remote observations of the ocean. The sensors of the newly launched Sentinel satellites provide a continuous flow of high resolution data in various wave ranges of the electromagnetic spectrum. The new dataflow opens the way to: 1) examining finer spatial scales of up to a few meters; 2) comparing radar and optical data obtained almost simultaneously over the same region at similar high spatial resolutions; 3) observing the dynamics of processes due to smaller time intervals between data acquisitions; and therefore 4) comparing satellite observations with model calculations of dynamics and transformation of, for example, oil pollution. The focus will be on estimating the contribution (direct and indirect) of dynamic processes of small scales (submesoscale eddies and jets, short period internal waves, small scale fronts, etc.) into the process of marine pollution propagation and modeling of the mechanisms through which small scale processes can affect pollution propagation. In the course of Project 2014, we realized the need to reconsider the relative contribution of processes of different scales into propagation of pollution of various types. The presence of submesoscale eddies, jets, small scale fronts, etc. often causes considerable deviations of the results produced by existing models from real situations. A combined analysis of high resolution satellite data acquired at small time intervals will enable the retrieval of the main parameters and spatial and temporal structure of hydrodynamic processes and phenomena and classification of the observed processes and phenomena into quasi-2D or 3D and therefore forecasting pollution propagation over or under the water surface. A special effort will be devoted to the improvement of the techniques for deriving quantitative metrics of various types of marine pollution from the new generation satellite data. Using the novel and improved techniques, we will reconstruct the propagation pattern of various pollution types and assess the actual ecological state of the zones of ecological risk of the Black, Caspian and Baltic Seas identified under Project 2014 and test regions of the Arctic seas. A comparison of the new results with those of Project 2014 will reveal the principal trends in the state of these regions. An essential part of the proposed project is the verification of satellite data based on the results of concurrent in-situ measurements and model calculations. The scientific novelty of the problems addressed consists in that they draw on the new capabilities of remote investigation of the ocean brought into being over the past few years due to the increasing dataflow from satellite sensors of the new generation. The sensors provide survey data with unprecedented spatial resolution and revisit frequency. Therefore, the task of forecasting the propagation of pollution in marine environment will be for the first time solved taking into account small scale processes and phenomena. Moreover, each object of interest, namely, sub- or mesoscale dynamic structure, oil spill evolution, suspended matter propagation, etc., will be investigated in a wide range of electromagnetic wavelengths, over multiple spatial scales and time intervals.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,17-17-00036,,,,,,,,Space Research Institute of the RAS,Space Research Institute of the RAS,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:15288322,,

New offshore applications of shallow foundations for liquid natural gas facilities and other subsea structures have underscored the importance of the behavior of shallow embedded foundations subjected to combined in-plane translation and torsion. This study investigates the undrained bearing capacity of rectangular and square shallow foundations under eccentric horizontal loads through comparisons of various limit-equilibrium and plastic-limit analysis solutions to three-dimensional finite-element (FE) solutions. In general, the plastic-limit approach considered in this paper agrees well with the FE solutions, although it has some tendency to overpredict capacity at greater embedment depths. The studies revealed a general insensitivity in the shape of the yield envelope to variations in embedment depth, which permits a simplified analysis suitable for first-order estimates of load capacity. The variables considered in this study include footing aspect ratio, embedment depth, and load direction in addition to eccentricity.

Storm-surge magnitude is inferred from residual water levels computed by subtracting modeled astronomical tides from observed water levels at each station. Observed residual water levels are generally smaller than reported storm-surge levels for cyclones where both are available, and many cyclones produce no obvious residual at all. Both maximum and minimum residual water levels are higher for west-landing cyclones producing onshore winds and generally diminish for cyclones making landfall on the Bangladesh coast or eastward producing offshore winds. Water levels observed during cyclones are generally more strongly influenced by tidal phase and amplitude than by storm surge alone. In only 7 of the 15 stations does the highest plausible observed water level coincide with a cyclone. Whereas cyclone-coincident residual water-level maxima occur at a wide range of tidal phases, very few coincide with high spring tides. Comparisons of cyclone-related casualties with maximum wind speed, hour of landfall, population density, and residual water level (inferred storm surge) show no significant correlations for any single characteristic.

Renewable energy sources (RES) such as wind, solar and biomass can provide reliable energy services and direct benefits at both national and local levels. Nowadays, in most non-interconnected islands the electricity generation cost is extremely high due to the utilization of outdated autonomous power stations (APSs) based on oil-fuel imports and diesel-electric generators. The objective of the present work is to investigate the possibility of achieving energy autonomy in very small (tiny) islands based exclusively on the use of RES. For that reason, a small Aegean Sea island (i.e. Agathonisi) which faces serious energy and water shortage problems is investigated. The proposed system configuration includes commercial wind turbines, photovoltaic panels, batteries and an internal combustion-electrical generator consuming biogas. The excess electricity is used for fresh water production via sea water desalination.

Using an oceanic perspective and placing the ideas of Japanese star architect and Metabolist movement member Kiyonori Kikutake and US ocean expert John P.

Several of their proto-ecomodernist ideas, born as techno-optimist reactions to neo-Malthusian fears of resource depletion and overpopulation, have become central pillars of ecomodernist thought.

In planning for such a future, the Government must consider the mix of technologies, the locations and configurations of very large scale arrays and their performance, and the implications of anticipated changes to the marine environment from climate change. In establishing its strategic policy positions, the Government must also ensure that legal obligations are met, particularly those under the European Marine Strategy Framework Directive (MSFD) to achieve Good Environmental Status (GES) by 2020.The EcoWatt2050 consortium has been established through the auspices of the Marine Alliance for Science and Technology for Scotland (MASTS) with Heriot-Watt University and the Universities of Edinburgh, Aberdeen, Strathclyde, Swansea and the Highlands and Islands, the National Oceanography Centre (Liverpool) and with Marine Scotland Science (MSS), the organization responsible for providing scientific advice to the Scottish Government on all aspects of marine renewable energy development, policy and planning. The research programme has been specifically designed to respond to questions posed by MSS: (1) How can marine planning be used to lay the foundation for the sustainable development of very large scale arrays of marine renewable energy devices? (2) What criteria should be used to determine the ecological limits to marine renewable energy extraction, and what are the implications for very large scale array characteristics? (3) How can we differentiate the effects of climate change from energy extraction on the marine ecosystem? (4) Are there ways in which marine renewables development may ameliorate or exacerbate the predicted effects of climate change on marine ecosystems? The overarching objective is thus to determine ways in which marine spatial planning and policy development, can enable the maximum level of marine energy extraction, while minimizing environmental impacts and ensuring that these meet the legal criteria established by European law.The research is structured in 5 workstreams. The first led by MSS will monitor progress and set out scenarios for the mix of technologies, very large scale array configurations, and environmental acceptance criteria. The second led by Edinburgh University will develop the hydrodynamic models necessary to examine the physical changes brought about by very large scale energy extraction, including under conditions anticipated from climate change. These outputs feed directly into workstreams 3 and 4 led by HWU and Aberdeen University respectively. These extend this work to examine changes in availability and location of critical habitats for benthic and mobile marine species, and to determine the consequences of changes in critical habitat for the ecosystem as a whole. Finally, workstream 5 led by MSS provides a synthesis of this research, quantifying the balance between energy extraction and environmental change and acceptance criteria to be used in marine spatial planning and policy development.EcoWat2050 builds in direct participation from industry in various aspects of its work, and has a number of wider knowledge exchange and stakeholder engagement activities planned.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,EP/K012851/1,,,,,,,,Heriot-Watt University,,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:15388333,,

Application of in situ thermal treatments, monitored by Small Amplitude Oscillatory Shear (SAOS), may lead to remarkable changes in the gel strength of CF-based emulsions, depending on processing conditions. If the heating temperature is above a critical value, the exposition time being long enough, thermal energy eventually leads to coalescence of oil droplets and subsequent emulsion destabilization. This behaviour has been confirmed by Droplet Size Distribution (DSD) measurements. The pH exerts a strong influence on the evolution of viscoelastic moduli. Little changes are produced at alkaline conditions, whereas a noticeable enhancement is apparent at neutral and acid pH. Application of consecutive double thermal cycle confirms the reversibility of the reinforcement induced by the cooling stage. The results may be explained in terms of the balance between electrostatic forces (predominant at alkaline pH) and hydrophobic interactions that favour protein aggregation and crosslinking (over heating stages), as well as hydrogen bonding (at the cooling stage).In addition, the influence of gel strength enhancement on the subsequent improvement of emulsion stability has been investigated by applying thermal treatments in a thermostatic bath. A clear enhancement in emulsion stability is achieved by these thermal treatments, although its contribution is not enough to produce long-term stability and a combination with other stabilizing strategies should be developed.

In an effort to reduce the worldwide dependence on fossil fuels, cleaner power generation methods are being sought in the field of solar, biomass, wind and wave energy. The importance of wave energy is increased in particular in some countries like UK, Portugal, Spain and Japan. A considerable progress has already been achieved in this field but the available technical designs are not adequate to develop reliable wave energy converters. Wave energy is the most available energy associated in water seas and oceans. Simultaneously, the wave energy has consisted of two types of energies: potential and kinetic energy. Therefore, many attempts have been applied to capture these energies. In the present work, a wave generator device has been designed and manufactured to simulate and generate the heaving motion of sea waves with different specification. A PC based electro-pneumatic control system was designed and implemented to individually control wave height, these heights are 3, 8, 16, 18 and 20 cm and different frequencies to generate these regular and irregular waves.

During March 2010, while weather in North America was dominated by unusually low temperatures and winter storms in conjunction with large low-pressure systems, we observed an unusually broad extension of the MARS plume. Winds favorable for offshore transport along with high freshwater discharge contributed to a widespread MARS plume, which was statistically different from those normally occurring in spring. A strong relationship was observed between the location of this widespread plume and a reduced partial pressure of carbon dioxide (P-CO2) and elevated satellite-derived chlorophyll a. Furthermore, P-CO2 in the plume was reduced by 6.3 Pa (62 ppm) in March 2010 in contrast to a reduction of only 2.4 Pa in April 2009, thus exhibiting a greater CO2 uptake capacity in March 2010. This wide plume also covered at least twice the area and was a stronger CO2 sink by a factor of five when compared to more typical plume conditions in April 2009. Extending across the Louisiana shelf to the pelagic ocean, this widespread MARS plume encompassed regions that would normally exhibit nearly net zero air-sea CO2 exchange and resulted instead in a strong net sink for atmospheric CO2.

Conventional steel risers affect the deck of an offshore platform considerably due to their weight under the influence of environmental loads, impacting the fatigue and serviceability life of the structure. The study of behavior of the risers in extra critical environmental conditions could be contributory to developing the effective economical alternatives to boost up the serviceability life of the structure. To this aim, in the current study, a traditional gas export riser, oil export riser and also a thermoplastic composite pipe as a new material in offshore applications are assumed for an offshore jacket located in the North Sea. To simulate the extra critical condition, a Rogue wave has been considered. The Rogue wave with return period of 100 years has been exerted on the mentioned risers by dynamic analysis in the time domain with finite element method using ANSYS software. For an accurate analysis, two well-known wave theories including the 1st and 5th order wave theories are utilized. Afterwards, the displacements and in particular reaction forces of the mentioned risers were compared. It is shown that for gas export riser and oil export riser, 5th order wave places less force on the main deck of the offshore jacket in comparison to the 1st order wave. Also, thermoplastic composite pipe response to Rogue wave has a minimal effect on the deck structure as compared to the gas export riser and oil export riser.",,,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,,,2307-1877,2307-1885,,,,,,,,,,"Istanbul Aydin Univ, Dept Civil Engn, TR-34295 Istanbul, Turkey",,,,2016-11-24,WOS:000385260400003,,

This field study evaluates how buildings and sand-trapping fences change the direction of wind approach, reduce wind speed, and restrict fetch distances for sediment entrainment, thereby reducing the potential for aeolian transport and development of dunes in enclaves.Field data were gathered in an 80 m long, 44 m deep beach enclave on the ocean shoreline of New Jersey, USA. Comparison of wind characteristics in the enclave with a site unaffected by buildings revealed that offshore winds in the enclave are reduced in strength and altered in direction by landward houses, increasing the relative importance of longshore winds. Vertical arrays of anemometers on the foredune crest, foredune toe and berm crest in the enclave revealed increasing wind speed with distance offshore, with strongest winds on the berm crest. Vertical cylindrical traps on the foredune crest, foredune toe, mid-backshore, berm crest and upper foreshore revealed the greatest rate of sediment transport on the berm crest. Sediment samples from the beach and from traps revealed limited potential for aeolian transport because of coarse grain sizes.Strong oblique onshore winds are common in this region and are normally important for transporting sand to dunes. The length of an enclave and the setback distance on its landward side determine the degree to which sediment delivered by oblique winds contributes to dune growth. The landward edge of the enclave (defined by a sand fence near the dune toe) is sheltered along its entire length from winds blowing at an angle to the shoreline of 25 degrees or less. A foredune set back this distance in an enclave the length of an individual lot (about 20 m) would be sheltered at an angle of 57 degrees or less, reducing the opportunity for dune building by onshore winds. Reduced potential for aeolian transport in enclaves implies that human actions may be required to build dunes artificially to protect buildings and roads from storm overwash. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

The combination of these regional-scale anomalies seems to have set the stage for environmental disturbances that, although not new in western Patagonia, occurred with unprecedented magnitude, including severe urban air pollution episodes, large forest fires, and the worst ever recorded harmful algae bloom (HAB). The local climate anomalies were in turn related to the concomitant strong El Nino (through atmospheric teleconnections) and, to a lesser extent, anthropogenic climate change mediated by the positive polarity of the Southern Annular Mode (SAM) and internal variability, as both modes weakened the westerlies.

We employed various techniques to characterize the complex pore structures of 12 shale samples collected from two marine shale formations in upper Yangtze area (UYA) in China. The characterization techniques include field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM), high-pressure mercury intrusion porosimetry (MIP), and low-pressure N-2/CO2 adsorption. The excess methane adsorption capacity was measured for each sample and the results were modeled using Langmuir model. Based on the FE-SEM image analyses, micro- and meso-pores within organic matter and inter-particle pores between or within clay minerals are the most commonly developed in these shale samples. Both uni-and multi-modal pore size distributions (PSDs) were observed, and a significant portion of pores are in the pore size range between 3 and 100 nm. It was also found that the micropore (<2 nm) is the major contributor to the overall specific surface area (SSA), whereas most of the pore volume is occupied by mesopores (2-50 nm). Two different fractal dimensions, pore surface fractal dimension (D-1) and spatial geometry fractal dimension (D-2), were estimated from low pressure N-2 isotherms, with D-1 ranging between 2.469 and 2.682, and D-2 ranging between 2.576 and 2.863, indicating that the surface and volume of pore structure are heterogeneous. Samples with higher D-1 can provide more adsorption sites for methane and tends to have relatively high adsorption capacity, whereas shales with higher D-2 do not influence the gas adsorption and storage capacities. Methane adsorption capacity increases with the increase of both micropore volume and micropore surface area, and this confirms that microporosity is the governing factor on methane adsorption capacity and storage.

However, in the past they adapted to a broad range of ecological niches. For instance, the stratigraphically important middle Paleozoic scyphocrinoids are hypothesized to have been planktonic, employing their inferred gas-filled globular, chambered structure at the distal end of the stem, the so-called lobolith, as a buoyancy device with the crinoid calyx suspended below it. Here, we evaluate this hypothesis using evidence from skeletal micromorphology and theoretical biomechanical modeling. Lobolith walls are typically composed of ossicles, which are exclusively composed of constructional labyrinthic stereom. In plates from the distal side of the lobolith, this stereom extends into microperforate stereom layer, forming wavy ridges and spines. No microscale adaptations for preventing gas leaks and/or ingress of water (such as internal and external imperforate stereom layers) are known. Furthermore, theoretical calculations suggest that the scyphocrinoid tow-net mode of feeding would have resulted in small relative velocities between the towed filter and the ambient water, thus making it an ineffective passive filter feeder. We suggest that the lobolith of these crinoids acted as a modified holdfast rather than as a floating buoy. Its globular shape and distally positioned microspines served as adaptations for living in unconsolidated sediments, analogous to iceberg- and snowshoe-like strategies used by some mollusks and brachiopods. Like modern isocrinids, scyphocrinoids could have maintained an upright feeding posture by extending the distal portion of the stalk along the bottom.

Underwater exploratory vehicles typically employ wide-aperture Sound Navigation and Ranging (SONAR) imaging sensors. Although their wide aperture enables scouring large volumes of water ahead of them for obstacles, the resulting images produced are blurry due to integration over the aperture. Performing three-dimensional (3D) reconstruction from this blurry data is notoriously difficult. This challenging inverse problem is further exacerbated by the presence of speckle noise and reverberations. The state-of-the-art methods in 3D reconstruction from sonar either require bulky and expensive matrix-arrays of sonar sensors or additional narrow-aperture sensors. Due to its low footprint, the latter induces gaps between reconstructed scans. Avoiding such gaps requires slow and cumbersome scanning by the vehicles that carry the scanners. In this paper, we present two reconstruction methods enabling on-site 3D reconstruction from imaging sonars of any aperture. The first of these presents an elegant linear formulation of the problem, as a blind deconvolution with a spatially varying kernel. The second method is a simple algorithmic approach for approximate reconstruction, using a nonlinear formulation. We demonstrate that our simple approximation algorithms perform 3D reconstruction directly from the data recorded by wide-aperture systems, thus eliminating the need for multiple sensors to be mounted on underwater vehicles for this purpose. Additionally, we observe that the wide aperture may be exploited to improve the coverage of the reconstructed samples (on the scanned object's surface). We demonstrate the efficacy of our algorithms on simulated as well as real data acquired using two sensors, and we compare our work to the state of the art in sonar reconstruction. Finally, we show the employability of our reconstruction methods on field data gathered by an autonomous underwater vehicle.",,,,,,,,,39,1,0,0,1,0,42,,,1556-4959,1556-4967,,,,,,,,,,"Heriot Watt Univ, SeeByte Ltd, Ocean Syst Lab, Edinburgh, Midlothian, ScotlandUniv Edinburgh, Edinburgh, Midlothian, ScotlandHeriot Watt Univ, Edinburgh, Midlothian, Scotland",,,,2018-10-16,WOS:000446433000004,,

Therefore, it is crucial to understand how oil influences the microbial communities in sediments that play key roles in ecosystem functioning. Ecosystems such as sediments are characterized by intensive bioturbation due to burrowing macrofauna that may modify the microbial metabolisms. It is thus essential to consider the bioturbation when determining the impact of oil on microbial communities. In this study, an experimental laboratory device maintaining pristine collected mudflat sediments in microcosms closer to true environmental conditions - with tidal cycles and natural seawater - was used to simulate an oil spill under bioturbation conditions. Different conditions were applied to the microcosms including an addition of: standardized oil (Blend Arabian Light crude oil, 25.6 mg.g(-1) wet sediment), the common burrowing organism Hediste (Nereis) diversicolor and both the oil and H. diversicolor. The addition of H. diversicolor and its associated bioturbation did not affect the removal of petroleum hydrocarbons. After 270 days, 60% of hydrocarbons had been removed in all microcosms irrespective of the H. diversicolor addition. However, 16S-rRNA gene and 16S-cDNA T-RFLP and RT-PCR-amplicon libraries analysis showed an effect of the condition on the bacterial community structure, composition, and dynamics, supported by PerMANOVA analysis. The 16S-cDNA libraries from microcosms where H. diversicolor was added (oiled and un-oiled) showed a marked dominance of sequences related to Gammaproteobacteria. However, in the oiled-library sequences associated to Deltaproteobacteria and Bacteroidetes were also highly represented. The 16S-cDNA libraries from oiled-microcosms (with and without H. diversicolor addition) revealed two distinct microbial communities characterized by different phylotypes associated to known hydrocarbonoclastic bacteria and dominated by Gammaproteobacteria and Deltaproteobacteria. In the oiled-microcosms, the addition of H. diversicolor reduced the phylotype-richness, sequences associated to Actinobacteria, Firmicutes and Plantomycetes were not detected.

This report is one of four related papers and describes the non-volatile hydrocarbon chemistry studies. The dispersion of the PFW into dissolved and particulate fractions of seawater were measured using moored high volume water samplers, surface screen samplers and moored and drifting sediment traps. Bio-accumulation was studied using transplanted oysters, and dispersion measured into sediment with benthic grabs.Results showed enrichment in non-volatile hydrocarbons in surface microlayer samples to a distance of 1.8 km in the direction of tidal flow. Concentrations in surface microlayers near the platform varied by an order of magnitude and corresponded to when a surface slick was visible or not visible. Concentrations of oil in seawater ranged from 2.0 to 8.5 mu g l(-1) at near stations to 1.3 mu g l(-1) at 1.8 km. Water column samples showed the processes of desorption from particles for soluble components occur within the range of 1.8 km. Most particulate hydrocarbons drop out of suspension within c. 1 to 2 km from the platform. Fluxes of particulate hydrocarbons through the water column at c. 1 km, as estimated by moored sediment traps in 1995, were 138 to 148 ng cm(-2) day(-1). A decrease in sediment concentrations within c. 1 km of the platform was measured as 2.45 +/- 1.29 mu g g(-1) dry wt (n = 15) in 1994 to 0.86 +/- 0.54 mu g g(-1) dry wt (n = 21) in 1995, after the platform installed a centrifugal separator in the discharge treatment process. Thus the residence time of this relatively low molecular weight oil was estimated in the coarse aerobic sands surrounding the platform to be less than one year. Oysters suspended near the platform bio-accumulated hydrocarbons and other lipophilic organics in their tissues. Uptake rates and bio-concentration factors of hydrocarbons indicated potential toxicity at the near-field stations within c. 1 km radius.A mass balance was constructed to show the partitioning of the input of hydrocarbons from the PFW into the surrounding marine ecosystem. The rates of dissipation processes were estimated as follows: dilution from tidal currents>degradation in the water column>sedimentation>evaporation. The calculations based on maximum concentrations measured in the environmental samples accounted for 85% of the daily input suspended within a 1 km radius.It is estimated that the potential zone of toxic influence in the water column extends to a distance of approximately 1 km. Concentrations of oil in sediments were too low to indicate potential toxicity. By the collaborative application of oceanographic and geochemical techniques to marine environmental problems, we endeavour to provide effective feedback to the oil industry to gauge the effectiveness of their operational strategies in minimizing impact in these pristine regions.

Modeling organism distributions from survey data involves numerous statistical challenges, including zero-inflation, overdispersion, and selection and incorporation of environmental covariates. In environments with high spatial and temporal variability, addressing these challenges often requires numerous assumptions regarding organism distributions and their relationships to biophysical features. These assumptions may limit the resolution or accuracy of predictions resulting from survey-based distribution models. 2. We propose an iterative modeling approach that incorporates a negative binomial hurdle, followed by modeling the relationship of organism distribution and abundance to environmental covariates using generalized additive models (GAM) and generalized additive models for location, scale, and shape (GAMLSS). Our approach accounts for key features of survey data by separating binary (presence-absence) from count (abundance) data, separately modeling the mean and dispersion of count data, and incorporating selection of appropriate covariates and response functions from a suite of potential covariates while avoiding overfitting. 3. We apply our modeling approach to surveys of sea duck abundance and distribution in Nantucket Sound (Massachusetts, USA), which has been proposed as a location for offshore wind energy development. Our model results highlight the importance of spatiotemporal variation in this system, as well as identifying key habitat features including distance to shore, sediment grain size, and seafloor topographic variation. 4. Our work provides a powerful, flexible, and highly repeatable modeling framework with minimal assumptions that can be broadly applied to the modeling of survey data with high spatiotemporal variability. Applying GAMLSS models to the count portion of survey data allows us to incorporate potential overdispersion, which can dramatically affect model results in highly dynamic systems. Our approach is particularly relevant to systems in which little a priori knowledge is available regarding relationships between organism distributions and biophysical features, since it incorporates simultaneous selection of covariates and their functional relationships with organism responses.

This new activity in the marine environment requires an assessment of the potential environmental impacts to resources on the OCS and evaluation of technical issues related to proposed activities. The Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, Regulation and Enforcement (BOEMRE) has two distinct programs to conduct studies and research related to renewable energy: the Environmental Studies Program (ESP) and the Technology Assessment and Research Program (TA&R). Through ESP, BOEMRE collects a wide range of environmental information offshore the United States for environmental assessment. These studies are designed to provide an improved understanding of the ecosystem, a baseline for assessing cumulative effects, and the scientific basis for development of regulatory measures to mitigate adverse impacts. Each year, BOEMRE's ESP funds roughly $35M of research in a broad spectrum of biological, social and physical disciplines. Current environmental issues of importance for offshore renewable energy include noise, lighting, habitat disruption, collision, discharges, electromagnetic fields (EMF), space-use conflicts, effects on social systems and visual impacts. Environmental studies related to renewable energy are available online at: http://www.boemre.gov/eppd/sciences/esp/RenewableEnergyResearch.htm. The BOEMRE TA&R Program funds research associated with operational safety, engineering standards and pollution prevention. The TA&R Program was established in the 1970s to ensure that industry operations on the OCS incorporate the use of the Best Available and Safest Technologies (BAST). In order to set design standards for renewable energy facilities, the TA&R Program is investigating seabed topography, bathymetry, sediment types and meteorological and oceanographic conditions. It is envisioned that wave, current and floating wind turbines and other untested technologies will be presented in the near future that will require establishing minimally acceptable design standards for permitting their deployment. Through the TA&R Program, BOEMRE is collaborating with research institutions and industry on testing renewable energy systems at Ohmsett, the National Oil Spill Response Research and Renewable Energy Test Facility. Ohmsett provides a facility for testing, research and development of large to full-scale equipment for ocean wave and current technologies. Ohmsett has 18 years experience working with customers on research projects that include testing concepts for new products not yet in production and innovative studies for technologies to include wave modeling, remote microwave wind vector sensing and mast wake characteristics with waves and calm surface.

Feature selection is an important problem in machine learning, both in classification and regression problems. In renewable energy systems, feature selection appears related to prediction systems in the most important sources such as wind, solar and marine resources. The objective of the paper is twofold: first, a review of the most important prediction systems for renewable energy applications involving feature selection is carried out. Analysis and discussion of different feature selection problems in prediction systems are considered. We show that wrapper FSP approaches are those mostly used due to their higher performance. They include a diversity of algorithms, prevailing fast-training approaches. The lack of an uniform framework for FSP and the diversity of tackled problems impede a systematic assessment of the performance and properties of the applied methods. Thus, the simultaneously use of several global search mechanisms should be the preferred option. In a second part of the paper, we explore this possibility, by introducing a novel approach for feature selection based on a novel meta-heuristic, the Coral Reefs Optimization algorithm with Substrate Layer. This approach is able to combine different search mechanisms into a single algorithm, providing a global search procedure of high quality. We use an Extreme Learning Machine for prediction within this novel approach. The performance of the system is evaluated in a problem of wind speed prediction from numerical models input, using real data from a wind farm in Spain, where comparison with alternative regression algorithms is carried out. Improvements up to 20% in hourly and daily wind speed prediction are obtained with the proposed system versus the algorithms without the feature selection process considered.",,,,,,,,,96,1,0,0,4,0,100,,,1364-0321,1879-0690,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Alcala, Dept Signal Proc & Commun, Madrid 28805, SpainIberdrola, Dept Energy Resource, Bilbao, SpainUniv Complutense Madrid, Dept Earth Phys & Astrophys, Madrid, SpainCSIC, IGEO, Inst Geociencias UCM, Madrid, Spain",,,,2018-07-01,WOS:000434917700049,,

The high cost of energy in the NANA region is one of the leading threats to the long term sustainability and wellbeing of the region. As a result of complex and lengthy logistics, the region has some of the highest energy prices in the nation. In addition to the cost of fossil fuels, NANA region residents are increasingly aware of the effects of greenhouse gases on climate change and the resulting coastal erosion along the Chukchi Sea.NANA Regional Corporation, along with other regional stakeholders, has developed a regional integrated energy plan. This approach includes community specific energy options analyses, benefit-cost analyses of competing alternatives, analysis of available literature and past experiences, surveying of professional opinion, and a regional energy summit that involved multiple stakeholders.Since the mid-1990s, the NANA region has been an Alaska leader in promoting and developing renewable energy resources with wind turbine installations in Kotzebue and Selawik. Promising wind energy potential is under investigation in several more communities, and other known energy resources being studied include geothermal, small-scale hydropower, and a substantial biomass potential in the upper Kobuk River area. Also under investigation arc stranded natural gas sources and even solar PV installations for some communities.Energy security in the region will be achieved by a combination of infrastructure improvement and development of appropriate energy technologies, both traditional and renewable. It is the vision of NANA region stakeholders to be 75% reliant on regionally available energy resources for heating and electric generation purposes by the year 2030, and to decrease the need for transportation fuel imported into the region by 50% by the year 2030. As part of this vision, imported fossil fuels would remain as emergency/back-up fuel only. With proper planning, a synergy can be developed between different energy sources and uses, with the composition of the optimal 'energy-mix' custom-tailored for each community in the NANA region.

Recently, this issue has become increasingly significant because regulators have invoked the precautionary principle and assume that all surfactants with molecular weight of less than 700 will bioaccumulate, leading to an increased number of oilfield-chemical products labeled as environmentally unacceptable.The relationship between the bioconcentration factor (BCF) of nonsurfactant substances and their corresponding octanol/water partition coefficient (P(ow)) value is well studied, and many relationships have been developed. Log P(ow) is generally, therefore, used as a surrogate for the BCF of nonsurfactant substances.This methodology cannot be applied directly to surfactants because the formal log P(ow) of such substances is difficult, if not impossible, to determine accurately. By their very nature, surfactants tend to form emulsions or accumulate at interfaces; therefore, the standard OECD 107 [Test No. 107: Partition Coefficient (n-octanol /water): Shake Flask Method 1995] or OECD 117 [Test No. 117: Partition Coefficient (n-octanol /water), HPLC Method 2004] protocols cannot be used.This paper describes a simple method for accurately determining the BCF of linear alcohol ethoxylates (LAEs), an important group of nonionic surfactants that are commonly used in the oil industry. Quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) software built on fragment contributions averaged over a large number of mostly nonsurfactant substances is initially used to calculate a log pseudoP(ow) value. This hydrophobic parameter is then correlated to BCF values determined in flow-through experiments, with excellent agreement (R(2) > 0.99). The method involves no animal testing, is inexpensive to set up and perform, is accessible to all, is quick and easy to use and verify, and gives clear output.",,,,,SPE Offshore Europe Oil & Gas Conference and ExhibitionSPE Offshore Europe Oil & Gas Conference and Exhibition,"SEP 08-11, 2009SEP 08-11, 2009",SPESPE,"Aberdeen, SCOTLANDAberdeen, SCOTLAND",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,1930-1855,,,,,,,,,,,"Schlumberger, Aberdeen, ScotlandSchlumberger, Houston, TX USA",,,,2011-08-24,WOS:000293722600002,,

The PI?s request funding to develop a fast, highly sensitive, gas concentration sensor, and to integrate it with a sonic anemometer, motion sensing, and data acquisition into an EC flux package suitable for operation from buoys and other platforms, such as ships. Our gas sensor is based on infrared (IR) absorption, but utilizes a novel, highly sensitive, photoacoustic detector. The PI?s expect that this combination will result in an improvement in sensitivity of several orders of magnitude over the IR absorption sensors that are currently in oceanographic use.

The scale of this oil spill, as well as the application of chemical dispersants to control it, is unprecedented; and its ecological impacts on the Gulf of Mexico are completely unknown. One issue of particular concern is the effect of surface oil slicks on the mortality rate of pelagic larvae of important fish and invertebrates, such as the blue crab, Callinectes sapidus. Blue crabs spawn in coastal waters, but larvae move offshore into the open marine environment where they pass through several larval stages before migrating back into the nearshore zone as megalopae to transform into juvenile crabs and settle into coastal marsh habitat. The pelagic larvae stages (i.e., zoea) are very sensitive to environmental stress and exposure to surface oil slicks and dispersant are highly likely to result in wide-spread mortality of blue crab larvae present. The location and size of the DpH oil slick currently in the northern Gulf of Mexico makes it highly likely that blue crab zoea will be exposed to either oil, dispersant or both and the objective of this RAPID project is to examine the impact of the DWH oil spill on blue crab settlement rates in coastal estuaries. Dr. Fulford and colleagues will measure the settlement rates of blue crab megalopae along the Mississippi coast and compare settlement in 2010 to historical patterns of settlement at the same sites. In addition, a predictive hydrodynamic model will be used to correct observed settlement for hydrodynamic forcing so that settlement rates in 2010 can be compared to historical patterns with a focus on changes in larval mortality rather than larval dispersal. The project will also make use of blue crab zoea and megalopae from the Gulf Coast Research Laboratory (GCRL) blue crab hatchery to conduct a series of experimental assays to assess the mortality rate of blue crab zoea and megalopae in response to crude oil and dispersant. These assays will allow for a stronger interpretation of field data, as the PIs can compare observed concentrations of crude oil and dispersant in the open marine environment to assay results to state clearly whether any observed changes in megalopal settlement might be due to oil-induced mortality. The results of this project will be important as an assessment of the ecosystem impact of the DpH oil spill, as well as important baseline data for measuring ecosystem recovery. Broader Impacts: This project will also have important broader impacts as the data will be used to calibrate food web model s of the coastal ecosystem to impacts of the oil spill. These models will allow for a broader examination of the impacts on specific species at the scale of the entire ecosystem. Further, the results of this project will be combined with the results of a spatial examination of blue crab settlement being conducted at Tulane University by Taylor and the two projects will form the nexus of a larger project to examine regional patterns of blue crab recruitment in support of ecosystem-based management. Finally, the PIs will make use of a long-term dataset from GCRL on blue crab settlement in coastal marshes that has not been previously used or published in its entirety, thereby making the data more available to the scientific community. This project is being implemented by several early-career researchers who will be able to build on project findings to build their research programs.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,1044368,,,,,,,,University of Southern Mississippi,,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:13969069,,

Three decades of data measured over the California shelf at NOAA buoys are used to describe the seasonal variability of the winds that force upwelling and the response of the coastal ocean in terms of sea temperature. Moreover, seasonal patterns in surface chlorophyll and alongshore currents are determined from one decade of data. In addition to clear seasonality, all these data exhibit distinct spatial and non-seasonal temporal variability in upwelling. Based on alongshore wind stress characteristics in central and north California, three seasons are defined: Upwelling Season (April-June) with strong upwelling-favorable winds and large standard deviation due to frequent reversals; Relaxation Season ( July-September) with weak equatorward winds and low variability; and Storm Season ( December-February) characterized by weak mean wind stress but large variability. The remaining months are transitional, falling into one or other season in different years. In addition to large-scale latitudinal differences in wind stress, spatial differences are associated with coastal topography - specifically the acceleration of wind downstream of capes. Latitudinal differences in sea surface temperature depend on wind stress, both local and large-scale, but also on surface heating and offshore influences. Intra-annual and inter-annual anomalies in wind and sea surface temperature are associated with variability in coastal winds, large-scale winds, and offshore basin-scale ocean conditions. Satellite chlorophyll concentration shows an optimal window relation with upwelling forcing, allowing maximum concentrations during moderate winds and minimal during poor or strong winds.",,,,,,,,,118,0,0,0,67,1,141,,,2169-9275,2169-9291,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Calif Davis, Bodega Marine Lab, Bodega Bay, CA 94923 USA",,,,2012-03-17,WOS:000301671600004,,
J,,,,,,,,,Beth Scott,,Automation of Marine Growth Analysis for Decommissioning Offshore Installations,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Awarded Grant,Apr 30 2016,2016,"Permanent offshore structures form artificial reefs which provide attachment and settlement sites for marine organisms. In the UK, some of the oldest platforms have been in the water for over 40 years and have considerable colonisation of marine organisms. Marine Growth organisms generally include seaweeds, soft corals and mussels in the areas where light penetrates(photic zone) as well as anemones, hydroids and cold-water corals on the deeper sections of the platforms. One of the first marine growth studies published was on the Montrose platform back in 1982; and significant discoveries have been made during offshore installation marine growth assessments since then, such as the first discovery of the CITES Listed Lophelia pertusa coral growing on offshore platforms during the decommissioning of the Brent Spar storage buoy, the with results subsequently being published in Nature in 1999. L. pertusa as since been recorded on the majority of northern North Sea platforms - and therefore their presence on the structures may be contributing to the connectivity of the protect reefs in the UK and Norway.Marine growth causes issues for the oil and gas industry (operators) by adding additional weight to the structure which may cause damage and impair visual inspection of important equipment, both in routine and decommissioning scenarios. New areas of interest have also developed around platform marine growth, including the potential for marine invasive species, potential stepping stone habitats, artificial reefs for conservation (e.g. de-facto MPAs) or fish using the structures for food and shelter. In areas of the Gulf of Mexico, a rigs-to-reef programme, (the conversion of offshore platforms into designated artificial reefs) is underway. However, in Europe, particularly in the North East Atlantic OSPAR region, there is a requirement to remove all offshore infrastructures from the seabed (although derogations may be granted). As part of the decommissioning plan, an operator may be required to assess the extent of marine growth on a platform to determine the additional weight added to the platform (for structure removal) or for potential organic waste disposal and especially if species of conservation importance (e.g. Lophelia and Sabellaria) are present. This project will use a pre-devolved method (CoralNet) to analysis images of marine growth on offshore structures. The method will allow for more images to be analysed, compared to traditional assessment methodology and will allow for a more consistent approach, potentially providing for a good long-term monitoring tool. In addition, finding new and innovative monitoring methods, is not only about collecting data in the field, but also about how the data should be analysed, with this project will contribute.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,NE/N019865/1,,,,,,,,University of Aberdeen,,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:15341693,,

A steel lazy wave riser (SLWR) is considered to be a cost-effective alternative to get the gas or oil flow up to the platform under these conditions. The staggered buoyant section provides buoyancy force which forms an arch shape of the SLWR. This arch shape makes the SLWR configuration flexible and isolates the dynamic responses of the upper part and lower part of the riser. However, there is a lack of full understanding of the behavior of SLWRs. This is, due to a complicated loading from waves, vessel motions and flow induced vibrations caused by ocean currents, complex structural configurations, and nonlinearities. Time-domain simulation is necessary to accurately predict the dynamic responses and capture the non-linearities. Realistic fatigue damage calculation is essential in the design phase of SLWR.

The atmospheric formulation is based upon the NCAR regional climate model RegCM2, and includes the NCAR Community Climate Model Version 2 radiation scheme and the Biosphere-Atmosphere Transfer Scheme. The dynamic-thermodynamic sea ice model includes the Hibler-Flato cavitating fluid formulation and the Parkinson-Washington thermodynamic scheme linked to a mixed-layer ocean.Arctic winter and summer simulations have been performed at a 63 km resolution, driven at the boundaries by analyses compiled at the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts. While the general spatial patterns are consistent with observations, the model shows biases when the results are examined in detail. These biases appear to be consequences in part of the lack of parameterizations of ice dynamics and the ice phase in atmospheric moist processes in winter, but appear to have other causes in summer.The inclusion of sea ice dynamics has substantial impacts on the model results for winter. Locally, the fluxes of sensible and latent heat increase by over 100 W m(-2) in regions where offshore winds evacuate sea ice. Averaged over the entire domain, these effects result in root-mean-square differences of sensible heat flux and temperatures of 15 W m(-2) and 2 degrees C. Other monthly simulations have addressed the model sensitivity to the subgrid-scale moisture treatment, to ice-phase physics in the explicit moisture parameterization, and to changes in the relative humidity threshold for the autoconversion of cloud water to rainwater. The results suggest that the winter simulation is most sensitive to the inclusion of ice phase physics, which results in an increase of precipitation of approximately 50% and in a cooling of several degrees over large portions of the domain. The summer simulation shows little sensitivity to the ice phase and much stronger sensitivity to the convective parameterization, as expected.",,,,,,,,,113,8,0,0,7,0,122,,,0894-8755,,,,,,,,,,,"UNIV ILLINOIS,DEPT ATMOSPHER SCI,URBANA,IL 61801",,,,1995-06-01,WOS:A1995RE73700007,,

TRACE-A and SAFARI tropospheric aerosol and trace gas profiles measured over southern Africa and elsewhere in the subtropics of the southern hemisphere are examined in the light of the known stability structure of the regional atmosphere. Peaks in concentration, points of inflection in profiles and discontinuities in concentration loadings are closely related to the stable layers or the trapping that occurs between them. Estimates are given of percentage transfers of air between layers for different airstreams within the laminated structure. During SAFARI only 20 % of air parcels in the vertically integrated 70-500 hPa layer penetrated through the similar to 500 hPa stable layer. None from the 900-800 hPa layer did so.

The spar buoy, commonly used for deep-water drilling, oil and natural gas extraction and storage, as well as offshore wind and wave energy generation, is known to be prone to experience parametric resonance. In the vast majority of cases, parametric resonance is studied by means of simplified analytical models, considering only two degrees of freedom (DoFs) of archetypical geometries, while neglecting collateral complexity of ancillary systems. On the contrary, this paper implements a representative 7-DoF nonlinear hydrodynamic model of the full complexity of a realistic spar buoy wave energy converter, which is used to verify the likelihood of parametric instability, quantify the severity of the parametrically excited response and evaluate its consequences on power conversion efficiency. It is found that the numerical model agrees with expected conditions for parametric instability from simplified analytical models. The model is then used as a design tool to determine the best ballast configuration, limiting detrimental effects of parametric resonance while maximizing power conversion efficiency.",,,,,,,,,20,1,0,0,1,0,20,,,0924-090X,1573-269X,,,,,,,,,,"Politecn Torino, Dept Mech & Aerosp Engn, I-10129 Turin, ItalyUniv Lisbon, Inst Super Tecn, IDMEC, Ave Rovisco Pais 1, P-1049001 Lisbon, Portugal",,,,2020-07-07,WOS:000542748400002,32801477,

Thousands of oil spill workers participated in the spill response and clean-up efforts. The GuLF STUDY being conducted by the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences is an epidemiological study to investigate potential adverse health effects among these oil spill clean-up workers. Many volatile chemicals were released from the oil into the air, including total hydrocarbons (THC), which is a composite of the volatile components of oil including benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, xylene, and hexane (BTEXH). Our goal is to estimate exposure levels to these toxic chemicals for groups of oil spill workers in the study (hereafter called exposure groups, EGs) with likely comparable exposure distributions. A large number of air measurements were collected, but many EGs are characterized by datasets with a large percentage of censored measurements (below the analytic methods' limits of detection) and/or a limited number of measurements. We use THC for which there was less censoring to develop predictive linear models for specific BTEXH air exposures with higher degrees of censoring. We present a novel Bayesian hierarchical linear model that allows us to predict, for different EGs simultaneously, exposure levels of a second chemical while accounting for censoring in both THC and the chemical of interest. We illustrate the methodology by estimating exposure levels for several EGs on the Development Driller III, a rig vessel charged with drilling one of the relief wells. The model provided credible estimates in this example for geometric means, arithmetic means, variances, correlations, and regression coefficients for each group. This approach should be considered when estimating exposures in situations when multiple chemicals are correlated and have varying degrees of censoring.",,,,,,,,,21,0,0,0,18,0,23,,,2398-7308,2398-7316,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Minnesota, Div Biostat, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USAUniv Calif Los Angeles, Dept Biostat, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USAJohns Hopkins Univ, Bloomberg Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Environm Hlth & Engn, Baltimore, MD 21205 USAExposure Assessments Applicat LLC, Arlington, VA 22207 USANIEHS, Res Triangle Pk, NC 27709 USANCI, Bethesda, MD 20892 USAUniv North Carolina Chapel Hill, Dept Epidemiol, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USAStewart Exposure Assessments LLC, Arlington, VA 22207 USA",Exposure Assessments Applicat LLCStewart Exposure Assessments LLC,,,2017-08-14,WOS:000405564900009,28395309,

In the context of the UNESCO Convention on the Protection of the Underwater Cultural Heritage of 2001, gathering more information about the submerged cultural heritage in the intertidal zones of the North Sea is one of the main objectives of the Belgian scientific project 'SeArch'. It will give a clearer picture of the broader cultural and archaeological heritage in the region and it can be used as a basis for a sustainable management by government agencies. The Department of Geography (Ghent University, Belgium) contributes to the SeArch project in two ways. First, an innovative survey methodology has been developed which allows an accurate and cost-efficient evaluation of the archaeological potential in the intertidal zones of the Belgian beaches. Secondly, the Department of Geography is developing an interactive webGlS platform, which makes it possible to share, integrate and visualize the gathered archaeological and environmental data and information in a user-friendly way. Hereby, the total potential of this project is fully exploited in a time-efficient manner. To create an interactive webGlS platform, a good structured spatial database is needed. It enables manipulation of a wide variety of georeferenced information in both raster and vector formats. This paper provides more information about the configuration and application of the spatial database. Moreover, it focusses on the development of a fully functional Spatial Data Infrastructure (SDI) using the most reliable, powerful and state-of-the-art technological components.

As an attempt to refine he chronostratigraphy of the Pleistocene depositional systems, electron spin resonance (ESR) ages were obtained in 42 disarticulated shells of the marine bivalve Amiantis purpurata preserved in deposits in the southern CPRS, consisting of 35 specimens from five boreholes made during the construction of wind farms, plus another 7 shells from an irrigation channel. The shells were obtained from depths between 5.5 and 14 m, in two chronostratigraphically distinct depositional units (Barrier-Lagoon Systems II and III). Although the ages in each group of samples vary widely, the youngest age from the Barrier II ([approximately]247 ka) is consistent with the timing of the transgression of the marine isotope stage (MIS) 7 inferred from other luminescence and ESR ages of sediments and shells. The ages obtained in shells from the Lagoon III deposits located landward of the Barrier III indicate deposition by the sea-level highstand of the substage MIS 5e, despite being older than the estimated age of [approximately]120 ka of the latter. The younger shells from the seaward side of the Barrier III dated as of [approximately]100 ka indicate deposits formed by the low-amplitude MIS 5c highstand, in agreement with luminescence ages of [approximately]109, 104 and 101 ka obtained in outcrops on the shoreline. One shell dated as [approximately]87 ka could indicate another highstand during MIS 5a. The presence of shells much older than the depositional systems indicate that marine deposits older than MIS 7 existed in the CPRS but were totally eroded by subsequent transgressions, and that shells can be preserved for periods of about 100-200 kyrs under certain conditions. Moreover, the ages younger than the highstand of MIS 5e on the seaward side of the Barrier III indicate that one (and possibly two) smaller amplitude highstands previously unrecognized in the CPRS left geological and fossil records in the study area.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,0895-9811,,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Fed Rio Grande Sul, Inst Geociencias, Ave Bento Goncalves 9500, Porto Alegre, RS, BR-91540000 BC, Brazil",,,,2020-08-03,ZOOREC:ZOOR15608057349,,

At the British Antarctic Survey base of Halley, 75 degrees S, the sun does not rise for 110 d in the winter and does not set for 100 d in summer. Photoperiod is the major time cue governing the timing of seasonal events such as reproduction in many species. The neuroendocrine signal providing photoperiodic information to body physiology is the duration of melatonin secretion which reflects the length of the night: longer in the short days of winter and shorter in summer. Light of sufficient intensity and spectral composition serves to suppress production of melatonin and to set the circadian timing and the duration of the rhythm. In humans early observations suggested that bright (>2000 lux) white light was needed to suppress melatonin completely. Shortly thereafter winter depression (Seasonal Affective Disorder or SAD) was described, and its successful treatment by an artificial summer photoperiod of bright white light, sufficient to shorten melatonin production. At Halley dim artificial light intensity during winter was measured, until 2003, at a maximum of approximately 500 lux in winter. Thus a strong seasonal and circadian time cue was absent. It seemed likely that winter depression would be common in the extended period of winter darkness and could be treated with an artificial summer photoperiod. These observations, and predictions, inspired a long series of studies regarding human seasonal and circadian status, and the effects of light treatment, in a small overwintering, isolated community, living in the same conditions for many months at Halley. We found little evidence of SAD, or change in duration of melatonin production with season. However the timing of the melatonin rhythm itself, and/or that of its metabolite 6-sulphatoxymelatonin (aMT6s), was used as a primary marker of seasonal, circadian and treatment changes. A substantial phase delay of melatonin in winter was advanced to summer phase by a two pulse 'skeleton' bright white light treatment. Subsequently a single morning pulse of bright white light was effective with regard to circadian phase and improved daytime performance. The circadian delay evidenced by melatonin was accompanied by delayed sleep (logs and actigraphy): poor sleep is a common complaint in Polar regions. Appropriate extra artificial light, both standard white, and blue enriched, present throughout the day, effectively countered delay in sleep timing and the aMT6s rhythm. The most important factor appeared to be the maximum light experienced. Another manifestation of the winter was a decline in self-rated libido (men only on base at this time). Women on the base showed lower aspects of physical and mental health compared to men. Free-running rhythms were seen in some subjects following night shift, but were rarely found at other times, probably because this base has strongly scheduled activity and leisure time. Complete circadian adaptation during a week of night shift, also seen in a similar situation on North Sea oil rigs, led to problems readapting back to day shift in winter, compared to summer. Here again timed light treatment was used to address the problem.Sleep, alertness and waking performance are critically dependent on optimum circadian phase. Circadian desynchrony is associated with increased risk of major disease in shift workers. These studies provide some groundwork for countering/avoiding circadian desynchrony in rather extreme conditions. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

The seeping methane bubbles and hydrates were numerically tracked by a Lagrangian method. The numerical model of tracking methane gas considered the phase change of methane due to thermophysical conditions. The amount of seeping methane from the seabed and the initial bubble diameter distribution were given based on a field observation, and the ambient flow conditions were given with the JCOPET reanalysis data of the JAMSTEC. Three ambient flow conditions were used to assess the dependency of the numerical algorithm because the JCOPET reanalysis data included an uncertainty in the flow velocity components. The comparison of the numerical results obtained using three different ambient flow conditions showed that the plume structure formed by dispersed methane gas/hydrate strongly depended on the horizontal current flow. For the flow conditions close to those of actual sea current conditions, seeping methane gas changed to hydrate after a few meter rising from the seabed, and it returned to the gas phase at a water depth of about 300 m, corresponding to the limit of hydrate stability. The numerically predicted transition of methane gas in deep water agreed with the field observation at the Joetsu Basin.

It is in these regions that the total loading of ice on infrastructure such as platforms, sea defense structures, sub-sea pipelines, or wind turbines may exceed the total loading of waves and currents, and may therefore determine the design. Thus, the interaction of ice with planned structures might be significant, and accurate models of ice dynamics would be invaluable to engineering in these regions. There is, however, a general lack of ice models that can be applied to study these complex integral physical processes at regional scales. Typically, ice modelling focusses on either large oceanic scales using climate models, or on local scales to study small-scale ice-structure interactions. The regional scale model presented in this paper is targeted at bridging this scale gap.This paper describes the implementation of an ice module in Delft3D. Delft3D is a flexible integrated modelling suite, which simulates two- and three-dimensional flow, sediment transport, morphology, waves, spills, water quality, and ecology, and is capable of handling the interactions between these processes. By dynamically coupling an ice module with these existing modules it becomes possible to not only predict the growth, melting, and transport of open-water ice and associated hydrodynamics, but also to study the interaction of ice with, for example, river banks, the seabed, water quality, or spills of fine sediments or oil. This paper presents the major concepts of the new Delft3D ice module, as well as example applications for various lakes in The Netherlands and Fountain Lake, in Minnesota, USA.

A comparison of circular columns with square columns on VIM characteristics of three-column semisubmersibles is carried out using the detached eddy simulation (DES) method via Star-ccm+ software. This paper analyzes motions in the transverse direction and yaw, as well as fluid forces including drag force and fluctuating lift force. The results show that transverse amplitudes of semisubmersible with three square columns are much lower than those of semisubmersible with three circular columns at all incidences. Besides, the authors conclude that the semisubmersible with three square columns do not experience obvious resonance behavior, which is different from the semisubmersible with three circular columns. Besides, galloping phenomenon occurred at large reduced velocities at 0 degrees-incidence for the semisubmersible with three square columns, which is likely not induced by lift force directly. Meanwhile, in these cases, yaw amplitudes are also larger than the others.

This phenomenon is neither new nor unique to Wells turbines, as an aerodynamic hysteresis is present in rapidly oscillating airfoils and wings, as well as in different types of turbomachinery, such as wind turbines and helicopter rotors, which share significant similarities with a Wells turbine. An important difference is the non-dimensional frequency: the hysteresis appears in oscillating airfoils only at frequencies orders of magnitude larger than the ones Wells turbines operate at. This work contains a re-examination of the phenomenon, using both computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and a lumped parameter model, and shows how the aerodynamic hysteresis in Wells turbines is negligible and how the often measured differences in performance between acceleration and deceleration are caused by the capacitive behavior of the OWC system.

The waves generated by short fetched land wind are usually neglected because they are thought to be small and short period waves. However, in case of land wind oblique to the long coast line with short fetch, unexpected long period high waves are developed along the coast by slanting-fetch effects. These high waves can damage human lives as well as coastal structures, but are difficult to predict using offshore wave measurement system. Therefore, it is important to understand the characteristics of waves by slanting fetch and prepare countermeasures against them.This paper analyzes observed wind and wave data in the East Sea, on Feb. 6-8th and Dec. 12-14th in 2013, when waves were developed by slanting-fetch effects near the coast.

Some acoustic anomalies recorded in the water column with hull-mounted single and multibeam echosounders are clearly caused by fluid escape at the seabed, most likely gases. These fluid emissions are associated at the seafloor with high backscatter subcircular smallscale mounds, on average less than 2 m high and a few metres in diameter. Based on near-bottom video and acoustic surveys, these mounds are interpreted to be by-products of gas seepage, possibly methane-derived authigenic carbonates. The spatial distribution of the seeps and related structures, based on water column acoustic gas flares and high backscatter seabed patches, appears to be relatively broad, with a North-South extension of similar to 65 km across the Parentis Basin and the Landes High, and a West-East extension along a few kilometres wide on the shelf. The seepage activity seems persistent through time at the annual scale, with acoustic evidence dating back to 1998. The spatial distribution of the fluid emissions at the Aquitaine Shelf may suggest possible sedimentary and tectonic controls in relation with the Pyrenean compression phase. The nature and the origin of the emitted fluids and seafloor mounds are unknown. The gases may correspond to biogenic methane from Late Pleistocene deposits or to thermogenic gases originating from deeper, Jurassic-Cretaceous levels. The oil province of the Parentis Basin raises questions regarding possible genetic links to the petroleum system. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Acoustic data was collected using a Simrad ES200-7C split-beam echosounder that was interfaced with an EK80 Wideband Transceiver. The echosounder was operated over a frequency bandwidth of 160-260 kHz. Direct measurements of gas flux were obtained using a bubble catch device (BCD) that was designed to capture gas in an inverted graduated cylinder through a funnel. An underwater camera that was attached to the BCD was used to capture images of the accumulation of gas within the cylinder. The echosounder was pole-mounted to the port side of the R/V Connell, while the BCD was hand deployed from the starboard side of the vessel. A Garmin WAAS-enabled GPS system was interfaced with the EK80 software to provide position of the vessel throughout the survey.Collection of both acoustic data and direct gas flux measurements were obtained at three seep sites located within the Coal Oil Point seep field: Platform Holly, Seep Tent and La Goleta. Data collection was obtained by positioning the vessel in locations of high seepage activity (verified with the acoustic data) and then allowing the vessel to drift over the area until no seepage activity was observed. Both the acoustic data and the direct gas flux measurements were collected simultaneously throughout the survey. The BCD was deployed at a depth of 23 m at La Goleta and Seep Tent and at 15 m at Platform Holly. A total of 20 .MP4 files were obtained with the BCD.A preliminary test run of the BCD was conducted at the La Goleta seep site at 1532 UTC. Following the BCD test, both acoustic data and video images from the BCD were acquired at the La Goleta seep site. At approximately 1930 UTC, data collection at La Goleta was completed and the R/V Connell transited to the Seep Tent seep site. Data collection at Seep Tent commenced at approximately 1956 UTC and was completed at 2116 UTC. A CTD cast was performed after the survey near Seep Tent. A field calibration was done for the ES200-7C split-beam echosounder following the CTD cast with a 28.5 mm Tungsten-Carbide calibration spheres. At 2150 UTC, the R/V Connell arrived at Platform Holly in order to collect both acoustic and BCD measurements.

The variation trend of corrosion rate with exposure time showed that the variation curves and degrees of three steels were generally identical and had nothing to do with the exposure time. The whole change trend of corrosion rates in three years showed that the corrosion rates of 20(#) steel were nearly identical in different positions, each of which was a little lower than that of 16 Mn steel specimens in corresponding positions, also was lower than that of; steel specimens in tidal zone and immersion zone. Although 20(#) steel corroded rapidly at first, its corrosion rate has a decreasing trend in the long-term service. Therefore, 20(#) steel is feasible to be applied for a long time in various marine zones, especially nearby the low tidal line and immersion zone. The results of A(3) steel, 16 Mn steel and 20(#) steel by means of electrically connected hanging plate in three years indicated that the corrosion of the steel specimens in the splash zone was the most severe as the result of dry-wet cycle and macrocell effect. Specimens in the other positions corroded mildly, and that in tidal zone corroded most slowly. The corrosion rate of 20(#) steel was the highest among the three steels in the test, and the corrosion rates of A(3) steel and 16 Mn steel were identical on the whole. When the specimens were hanged electro-connectedly, the macrocell effect generally tended to increase with exposure time. The. highest corrosion rate of A(3) steel in the splash zone in the three years was about 0.278 mm/a, while that of 16 Mn steel was about 0.321 mm/a, and that of 20(#) steel was 0.330 mm/a or so. In contrast, the corrosion rate of the steels in the tidal zone was the lowest in three years, which were 0.052 mm/a (A(3) steel), 0.048 mm/a (16 Mn steel) and 0.040 mm/a (20(#) steel).",,,,,,,,,14,1,0,0,0,0,14,,,0947-5117,,,,,,,,,,,"Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Oceanol, Dept Marine Corros, Qingdao 266071, Peoples R China",,,,2004-04-01,WOS:000220947100008,,

The aim Should be the broad public denial of poison application and to consistently call to account people who illegally Set Out poison, which may only be achieved by raising awareness and public relation activities. Lead intoxication: lead shot and bullet fragments were discussed as sources of lead intoxication in White-tailed Eagles. It was agreed that the removal of hunter shot carcasses and gut piles left in the field may help to mitigate the problem in the short term. However, the switch to nontoxic ammunition is essential for the protection of large raptors, but also for human health. Collisions and electrocution: the four subtopics dealt with at the workshop were (a) collisions with vehicles, (b) collisions with wires, (c) collisions with wind power plants and (d) electrocution. The inspection for carrion and mitigation of particular railway line sections, wire-marking, the prevention of power lines and wind turbines in hazardous areas as well as the legal prohibition of killer poles were considered of major importance. As a precautionary principle, potential settlement areas of large raptors should also be considered in terms of an ecological land use planning. Co-operations: national and international co-operations were considered favourable and important, as for instance the International Colour-ringing Pro, gramme, transnational surveys (e.g. synchronous winter censuses) and habitat protection in terms of a meta-population concept, joint public relation activities (e.g. concerning poisoning incidents) and regular international conferences or) the White-tailed Eagle. Disturbance/nest protection: despite the general approach, the discussion focused mainly on the topic of nest site protection. Its realization was considered markedly difficult due to various reasons (circumstances of land ownership, hunting legislations, lacking enforcement of existing laws etc.).

At locations along the northern coast, thermally driven offshore winds from the south dominate, especially during the cold season. During the warm season, downward mixing of westerly overlying winds becomes more important as the stability of the boundary layer stratification decreases. In the western part, locations are situated in valleys, resulting in two opposing along-channel dominant wind directions. Seasonal changes in atmospheric conditions are reflected in a reversal of the dominant wind direction, with a component towards the coast during the cold season. At all locations, a clear separation between different prevailing surface wind directions in each season can be achieved based exclusively on local mean sea level geostrophic wind direction. This allows statistical downscaling of the prevailing surface wind conditions from lower-resolution simulations of the surface pressure field and may improve local wind forecasts over complex terrain.",,,,,,,,,2,1,0,0,0,0,3,,,0177-798X,1434-4483,,,,,,,,,,"Iceland Meteorol Off, Div Atmospher Res, Reykjavik, IcelandKjeller Vindteknikk AS, Kjeller, Norway",Iceland Meteorol OffKjeller Vindteknikk AS,,,2012-02-16,WOS:000298999300002,,

The main components of the proposed system contains concentrated solar power (CSP), wind turbine, Rankine cycle, multi stage flash (MSF) desalination unit, water electrolyzer, a refrigeration unit, a food drying system, oxy-hydrogen combustor, domestic water heater, as well as hydrogen and oxygen storage units. Furthermore, for continuous operation of the system during night time and in cloudy weather conditions, a thermal energy storage (TES) unit and oxy-hydrogen combustion unit are integrated to the system. Based on energy and exergy balances, performance assessment of the proposed system is conducted. Moreover, effects of various parameters such as solar irradiation, wind speed and ambient temperature on some of the outputs of the system are investigated. The results illustrate that the proposed system fulfills most of the remote community requirements in an efficient, environmentally benign and uninterrupted way. The obtained results for the reference case show that with installation of parabolic trough concentrators (PTCs) on an area of 111,728 m(2), the plant produces net electrical power of approximately 11.4 MW, approximately 828 m(3)/day of freshwater, about 36 kg/s of hot air for food drying, about 31 kg/s of heated domestic water, approximately 920 kg/day of H-2 and about 2.26 MW of cooling. The overall energy efficiency of the system is found to be 50%, while the exergy efficiency of the system is 34%.

Barium, a major component of drilling muds, was the only chemical that changed significantly during the period of study. During drilling, barium concentrations in surface sediments increased 30-40% above background. After drilling stopped, barium concentrations decreased but, after 1.5 years, had not approached background concentrations of surface sediments. In trapped sediments, barium concentrations increased 200-300% during drilling but returned to background concentrations within 1 year after drilling had stopped.Hydrocarbon concentrations in sediments from the study area were occasionally elevated, but generally were not consistent with drilling activities. Examination of the petroleum hydrocarbon and PAH distributions indicated that a distinct petroleum signal was occasionally observed in some samples; however, natural seepage rather than drilling discharges is probably responsible for the randomly-elevated hydrocarbon concentrations.

The successfully launched HY-2B scatterometer is an important guarantee to continue the measurement of global ocean surface wind. In this paper, we use the European Center for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) reanalysis wind data, Tropical Atmosphere Ocean Array (TAO) and National Data Buoy Center (NDBC) buoy wind data to estimate the accuracy of the HY-2B retrieved wind. Our statistical results show that at speed range from 4 to 24 ms-1, the retrieved wind speed root mean square error (RMSE) with respect to the ECMWF wind speed is 1.58 ms-1, and the direction RMSE is 15.34, while the speed and direction RMSEs with respect to the TAO buoys located in the open ocean are 1.06 ms-1 and 15.98, respectively. Thus, the retrieved wind well satisfies the operational precision requirement of the HY-2B scatterometer, that is, the speed and direction RMSEs should be better than 2 ms-1 and 20.00, respectively, for the open ocean. Moreover, the NDBC buoys are mainly located in immediate offshore areas, HY-2B wind speed and direction RMSEs are 1.60 ms-land 19.14, respectively, which shows that HY-2B scatterometer has good ability to measure wind of offshore sea areas.

Together with the Habitats Directive, which came into force in 1992, the Birds Directive is still one of the main pillars of biodiversity conservation in the European Union. The article therefore gives a short overview of its application in the Federal Republic of Germany and lessons learned for improving its implementation in future years. Concerning the general regime of species protection as well as regulations for trapping and hunting, there is still a lack of full transposition of the Directive into the German Federal and regional laws on Nature Conservation and Hunting. E.g. the exceptions for farming, although known as one of the main drivers of biodiversity loss, are still too excessive, also excessive use of derogations under art. 9 is criticized. Together with the sites under the Habitats Directive, the SPAs (Special Protection Areas) form the coherent ecological network Natura 2000. The article shows that Natura 2000 has proved to be a great success, given that with today about 26,000 sites covering about 17 percent of the land surface of the European Union, Natura 2000 is the largest ecological network in the world. In Germany, following several complaints by NABU and an infringement procedure by the European Commission, the number and size of SPAs raised from 126 sites covering less than 2 percent on average until the end of 1992 (deadline for designations in the Eastern German Lander) up to 736 sites covering 40,023 square kilometers or 11.2 percent of the land surface in July 2009. In 2004, the 25' anniversary of the Directive, 466 SPAs covering 28,977 square kilometers summed up to about 8.1 percent of the land surface in Germany. Nevertheless, the designation of sites was only the first step. It could be verified that annex I-bird species profited from the designation of SPAs, but nevertheless nearly half of them are still not in a favourable conservation status. Many SPAs still lack of sufficient legal protection and suffer from massive threats by infrastructure, transport and recreational use, as well as new threats by offshore wind park development and massive gravel extraction even in Natura 2000 sites in the Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) of North and Baltic Sea. Other crucial points are the elaboration and implementation of management plans, monitoring and financing of Natura 2000-sites. And last but not least, the knowledge about and the acceptance of Natura 2000 and the Directive has to be improved among stakeholders, politicians and the broader public. The Birds and Habitats Directives and the network Natura 2000 have to be realized and accepted as major tools to achieve the aims of the 2010-target adopted at the Gothenburg Summit (2001) and any new targets to halt the loss of biodiversity by 2020 and beyond!",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,2,0,2,,,0944-5730,,,,,,,,,,,"NABU, c/o BirdLife International, European Divison, Avenue de la Toison d 'Or 67, B-1060 Brussels, Belgium",,,,2009-01-01,ZOOREC:ZOOR14701008746,,

Existing classifications of carbonate porosity do not really consider ichnological components, while bioturbation-focused classifications are based on the final appearance of burrow-related heterogeneities in the sedimentary rock. In this chapter, a novel approach is made classifying bioturbation-influenced porosity on the basis of the size as well as morphological and compositional features of bioturbate textures and discrete trace fossils. This newly proposed classification scheme aims for a better predictability of reservoir quality as an integral part of the reservoir-characterisation workflow together with sedimentological and diagenetic analysis. Selected examples of bioturbation-related modifications of rock properties are presented from a proximal-to-distal transect across the Permian-Triassic Khuff carbonate platform from the South Pars gas field in the Arabian (Persian) Gulf. As this case study shows, the generally low (< 12%) average porosity is significantly impacted by diverse bioturbation, which overall results in an enhancement of the reservoir quality but in some cases may also diminish it. In turn, these bioturbation-related rock modifications also lead to varying permeability and have an influence on reservoir connectivity (e.g., k(v)/k(h) ratio).",,,,,3rd Arabian Plate Geology Workshop on The Permo-Triassic Sequence of the Arabian Plate3rd Arabian Plate Geology Workshop on The Permo-Triassic Sequence of the Arabian Plate,"NOV 28-DEC 01, 2011NOV 28-DEC 01, 2011",,"Kuwait Oil Co, Kuwait, KUWAITKuwait Oil Co, Kuwait, KUWAIT",29,3,0,0,3,0,34,,,,,978-90-73834-42-2,,,,,,,,,"STATOIL, Stavanger, Norway",STATOIL,,,2013-01-01,WOS:000357375700012,,

It is terrestrial with roots fully functional in water and solute uptake, grows on exposed steep rocky cliffs and can occur just above the spill zone of sea waves under continuous sea spray. Thus, it can be subject both to water stress, particularly during the dry season, and to salt stress. Gas exchange of P. integrifolia leaves was measured on a clear day in Trinidad. Uptake of CO2 and leaf conductance to diffusion of water vapour had two peaks during the light period, larger one in the early morning and a smaller one in the late afternoon, which were separated by an extended midday depression of gas exchange. CO2 partial pressure in the leaf air-spaces increased during the midday depression. Leaf temperatures reached maximum of 51.6.degree. C and leaf-air water-vapour-concentration differences were also very high during the midday depression, when quantum fluxes were up to 2 mmol m-2 s-1 and higher. The midday depression is considered as a functional adaptation to tempporary water stress. Although P. integrifolia is subject to sea-spray, an internal osmotic pressure of only 0.91 MPa indicated that NaCl is not accumulated. Leaf epidermis cells are thick-walled and have a prominent cuticle. The abaxial leaf surface with the trichomes is not wettable, and the trichomes apparently do not function in water and soluble uptake. They cover the stomata densely and may create a favorable microenvironment around them. They also have a high reflectance. This does not prevent overheating of the leaves, but does reduce the photosynthetically active radiation penetrating to the mesophyll. The trichomes may thus contribute to the prevention of photoinhibition at high incident quantum flux.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,,0,0,0,,,0140-7791,,,,,,,,,,,"INST FUER BOTANIK, TECH HOCHSCH DARMSTADT, SCHNITTSPAHNSTR 3-5, D-6100 DARMSTADT, FEDERAL REPUBLIC OF GER, GERMANY",,,,1986-01-01,BCI:BCI198682110289,,

Tests to characterize the properties of the mooring lines, and geotechnical and hydrodynamic trials were also performed on a 1:40 laboratory scale. Mooring truncation problem is normally faced by the researchers working on model testing of mooring lines in deep water, because the depth of the lab is typically small. However, it does not seem to be a problem for offshore floating renewable energy devices which are usually in relatively shallow water. The influence of catenary weight, imposed displacements at the fairlead, wave-current loads and different types of sea bottom friction on the mooring systems were analysed in terms of tensions, movements and shape of force-displacement curve. However, scaling of the sea bottom and the mooring line interaction is a challenge. Although the damping effect was investigated and compared under different movement conditions, the conclusions achieved can be upscale to real scale but it must be noticed that there are limitations due to scale effect issues. A total of 111 test were performed. The influence of the hydrodynamic inertia and drag is negligible on long wave and slow motions, while they have more importance during shorter waves and quick motions.

For this purpose, a DSS is proposed which, based on cartographic information and using objective and quantifiable criteria, allows comparative assessments and analyses between different project alternatives. The analytical procedures used by the system include, among others, hydrodynamic modeling tools and visual impact simulators. In addition, impacts on marine species are assessed taking into account intrinsic ecological and biological aspects. The magnitude of the impacts is quantified by means of fuzzy logic operations and the integration of all the elements is carried out by an interactive multi-criteria analysis. The results are shown in tables, graphs and figures of easy interpretation and can be also visualized geographically by means of a cartographic viewer.The system identifies the main impacts generated in the different phases of the project and allows establishing adequate mitigation measures in search of optimized solutions. The establishment of the assessment criteria has been based on the abundant, but dispersed, scientific literature on the various elements of the system and having the opinion of experts in the various fields.

These bridges located in earthquake-prone areas may be subjected to severe earthquakes during their lifetime. Group pile foundations have been widely used in cross-sea bridges due to their structural efficiency, ease of construction, and low cost. This paper investigates the seismic performance of bridge pile foundation based on the seismic fragility analysis. Based on the analysis platform OpenSees, the three-dimensional finite model of the bridge pile foundation is developed, where the pile-water interaction is replaced by the added mass method, nonlinearp-y,t-z, andq-zelements are used to simulate pile-soil interaction, and the displacement of the surface ground motion due to seismic excitations is applied on all spring supports. The seismic fragility curves of the bridge pile foundation are generated by using the earthquake records recommended by FEMA P695 as input motions. The curvature ductility based fragility curves are obtained using seismic responses for different peak ground accelerations. The effects of pile-water interaction, soil conditions, and different types of ground motions on the bridge pier fragilities are studied and discussed. Seismic fragility of the pier-group pile system shows that Sec C (the bottom section of the pier) is the most vulnerable section in the example fluid-structure-soil interaction (FSSI) system for all four damage LSs. The seismic responses of Sec E (a pile section located at the interface of the soil layer and water layer) are much lower than other sections. The parameter analysis shows that pile-water interaction has slight influence (less than 5%) on the fragility curves of the bridge pier. For the bridge group pile foundations considering the fluid-pile-soil interaction, PNF may induce larger seismic response than far-field (FF) and no-pulse near field (NNF).

One of the main challenges for coastal flood forecasting systems is a lack of reliable forecast data of large-scale oceanic and watershed processes and the combined effects of multiple hazards, such as compound flooding at river mouths. Offshore water level anomalies, known as remote Non-Tidal Residuals (NTRs), are caused by processes such as downwelling, offshore wind setup, and also driven by ocean-basin salinity and temperature changes, common along the west coast during El Nino events. Similarly, fluvial discharges can contribute to extreme water levels in the coastal area, while they are dominated by large-scale watershed hydraulics. However, with the recent emergence of reliable large-scale forecast systems, coastal models now import the essential input data to forecast extreme water levels in the nearshore. Accordingly, we have developed Hydro-CoSMoS, a new coastal forecast model based on the USGS Coastal Storm Modeling System (CoSMoS) powered by the Delft3D San Francisco Bay and Delta community model. In this work, we studied the role of fluvial discharges and remote NTRs on extreme water levels during a February 2019 storm by using Hydro-CoSMoS in hindcast mode. We simulated the storm with and without real-time fluvial discharge data to study their effect on coastal water levels and flooding extent, and highlight the importance of watershed forecast systems such as NOAA's National Water Model (NWM). We also studied the effect of remote NTRs on coastal water levels in San Francisco Bay during the 2019 February storm by utilizing the data from a global ocean model (HYCOM). Our results showed that accurate forecasts of remote NTRs and fluvial discharges can play a significant role in predicting extreme water levels in San Francisco Bay. This pilot application in San Francisco Bay can serve as a basis for integrated coastal flood modeling systems in complex coastal settings worldwide.",,,,,,,,,7,0,0,0,0,0,8,,,,2073-4441,,,,,,,,,,"US Geol Survey, Pacific Coastal & Marine Sci Ctr, Santa Cruz, CA 95060 USAUS Geol Survey, New York Water Sci Ctr, Troy, NY 12180 USADeltares USA, 8601 Georgia Ave, Silver Spring, MD 20910 USANOAA, Phys Sci Lab, Earth Syst Res Labs, Boulder, CO 80305 USANOAA, Global Syst Lab, Earth Syst Res Labs, Boulder, CO 80305 USA",Deltares USA,,,2020-10-30,WOS:000579952600001,,

Foodborne diseases are an important cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide, although the real cost on lives and economies is underestimated. Only recently the World Health Organization attempted to quantify the real burden of food contamination, a task that revealed difficult due to the lack of official data, as many people afflicted never seek medical advice or are not correctly diagnosed and treated [1]. Fish consumption is considered a healthy habit recommended in the Mediterranean diet. Europe, and in particular Portugal, are large consumers, producers and importers of fresh and processed fish. However, fish is very prone to microbial spoilage, due to the high moisture content and pH [2]. The monitoring of fish freshness is currently performed by organoleptic evaluation of the overall quality, by assessing for example the colour of the eyes and texture of the skin. This is particularly difficult for processed and packed fish, as filets. Even frozen fish must be carefully controlled before freezing and during storage. There are a few other methods to assess fish spoilage, namely microbiological tests and analysis of volatile amines. However, these require specialised equipment, facilities and trained personnel. The fact that microbial growth produces a set of characteristic volatile organic compounds (VOCs) opens up possibilities in the field of fish monitoring, although largely unexplored as commercial products available to the fish-industry, suppliers and consumers [3]. The Sea2See project aims at filling this gap, by creating new tools towards gas sensing, focusing in the problematic of fish monitoring. The project aims to develop two prototype gas sensors that can be used in the entire supply chain, by employing bio-inspired materials. These materials are biocompatible, biodegradable, and require no energy for operation. The novelty of the Sea2See project lays in the gas sensing biomaterials which are inspired in sea organisms, and in the custom-built prototypes, which will offer an easy and fast solution for consumers and industrials.The Sea2See team comprises members from three distinct research units (UCIBIO& LAQV from REQUIMTE, and LIBPhysUNL). The team has strong expertise in biotechnology, biomaterials assembly and characterization, and sensor technology [4]-[8], and is supported by two consultants contributing in science communication and exploitation of intelectual property.The impact of Sea2See in society, academia and industry is far beyond the project. A new bio-inspired platform technology for gas sensing will be established, with future applications in food, medical, environmental and manufacturing areas.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,PTDC/BII-BIO/28878/2017,,,,,,,,Associação para a Inovação e Desenvolvimento da FCT,Associação para a Inovação e Desenvolvimento da FCT,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:15471631,,

One critically important emerging paradigm involves First Nation (a Canadian term for indigenous) collaboration and leadership in renewable energy projects. In this comparative case study analysis, we consider two different governance approaches pursued in distinct renewable energy project contexts: the clean energy projects of the Ojibway Pic River First Nation band in northwestern Ontario and the NaiKun Offshore Wind Project proposed in the ocean territory of the Haida Nation off the coast of British Columbia (BC). Focusing on themes of participation and multi-level governance, the case studies highlight the importance of authority and control in decision processes, the primacy of ensuring that scale and quality of design are carefully scoped, and the shaping role of inclusiveness in planning for wholly sustainable energy futures. Taken together, these cases illustrate that fluid governance arrangements which exploit the particular capacities of each actor may give rise to trust that ultimately forms the foundation of a co-produced model of renewable energy governance. We argue that while collaboration might aim to be inclusive of all interested actors, it is important to consider the extent to which a project design might sufficiently incorporate a community's long-term vision. We conclude that truly sustainable renewable energy development requires a project design that reflects community values, incorporates community control, and incentivises indigenous ownership.",,,,,,,,,33,0,0,0,4,0,35,,,1354-9839,1469-6711,,,,,,,,,,"Morningstar Enterprises, Kelowna, BC, CanadaUniv Cambridge, Dept Geog, Cambridge, EnglandUniv Waterloo, Dept Geog & Environm Management, Waterloo, ON, Canada",Morningstar Enterprises,,,2015-01-01,WOS:000212142200006,,

Participants completed an extensive battery of scales and questions concerning work, health and individual differences. Three questions based on the criteria from the International Classification for Sleep Disorders were used to categorise participants with SWD (n = 176). In addition, we asked participants whether SWD interfered with aspects of their life and high ratings were used to define severe shift work disorder (SSWD). The prevalence of SWD was 32.1% among night workers and 10.1% in day workers (p<.001). SSWD was present in 9.1% of night workers and 1.3% of day workers (p<.001).

Electron microscopic analysis of whole cells of Schizochytrium sp. employing sample preparation by high-pressure freeze substitution suggests the presence of secondary and tertiary semicrystalline structures of triacylglycerols within the oil bodies in Schizochytrium sp. A fine secondary structure consisting of alternating light- and dark-staining bands was observed inside the oil bodies. Dark bands were 29 +/- 1 Angstrom in width, and light bands were 22 +/- 1 Angstrom in width. The tertiary (three-dimensional) structure may be a multilayered ribbon-like structure which appears coiled and interlaced within the oil body. In freeze-fracture photomicrographs, Schizochytrium oil bodies exhibited fracture planes with terraces averaging 52 +/- 7 Angstrom in height which could correspond to the combined width of two halves of two light bands and one dark band observed in the high-pressure freeze substitution photomicrographs. The results suggest that triacylglycerols within Schizochytrium sp. oil bodies may be organized in a triple chain-length structure. High-pressure freeze substitution electron micrographs of two other highly unsaturated oil-producing species of microalgae, Thraustochytrium sp. and Isochrysis galbana, also revealed this fine structure, whereas microalgae containing a higher proportion of saturated oil did not.

The water quality in the bay is highly affected by pressure from major agricultural and industrial activities in the river basin. Fresh water is taken from the river and later returned, loaded with pesticides and fertilizers. Partially treated wastewater from riverbank towns and industries is discharged into the lower reaches of the river. This mechanism contributes to river pollution. The dramatic increase in Cullera's population during the summer tourist season and the limited capacity of the local water treatment plant also make it difficult to dispose of domestic wastewater, some of which is discharged untreated into the river or directly into the sea through a marine outfall. This freshwater input from the Jucar River and the marine outfall produces a highly polluted estuarine plume in the coastal region (with significant salinity gradients and complex spatial patterns), which is highly influenced by the hydrodynamics of the bay. Because of the discharge from the Jucar River, the sewage from the marine outfall and the particular geomorphological features of Cullera Bay, this plume may play a significant role in defining and supporting different aspects of the socioeconomic environment in neighboring areas, especially those related to water quality. However, the mean water quality in the bay does not depend only on the surface circulation pattern but also on the overall marine circulation in the water body, where the local bathymetry has more relative influence. Therefore, it is important to have the tools and capabilities needed to monitor and characterize the actual pollutant dispersion drivers (wind and hydrodynamics) to assess their influence at local and regional levels. This paper presents the characterization of the wind field and circulation pattern in Cullera Bay using data acquired during seven field campaigns. The analysis shows that there is strong seasonal behavior in the wind field, ranging from daily breeze patterns to persistent offshore winds. Although the wind field varies greatly throughout the year, the overall pattern mainly consists of daily breezes. However, the hydrodynamic field has proved to be very complex and, with a few exceptions, poorly correlated with the wind-field pattern. This poor correlation may be due to a nonhomogeneous wind field in Cullera Bay caused by a nearby mountainous barrier. Despite the complexity of the hydrodynamic field in each campaign, the overall analysis of the nearshore current pattern shows a strong boundary condition influence that mainly follows the isobaths rather than the wind field. The influence of the topography on the wind and currents may have significant implications for quantifying the relative importance of pollutant sources that harm the quality of the water in Cullera Bay.",,,,,,,,,4,0,0,0,2,0,4,,,0749-0208,1551-5036,,,,,,,,,,"Tech Univ Catalonia, Maritime Engn Lab, Barcelona 08034, SpainUniv Politecn Valencia, Environm Impact Assessment Grp, Valencia 46022, Spain",,,,2007-06-01,WOS:000207505900003,,

Many studies have evaluated the impact of oil and gas development on roads, but small, local communities-where road impacts are felt the most-do not have the resources to utilize much of this information or conduct the necessary advanced data-gathering and analysis. Using the Tuscaloosa Marine Shale (TMS) oil play in Mississippi as a case study, this paper presents a methodology for local planners to identify at-risk infrastructure.

This allowed us to verify that each drifter remained within a patch, Trajectories of the patches were assessed in relation to physical data (salinity, temperature, winds, and river discharge) and compared to trajectories predicted by a 2-dimensional mathematical model. Analysis of CTD data indicated that 3 patches were-initially tagged in the coastal plume emanating from Delaware Bay, while 5 patches were initially tagged in shelf water adjacent to the plume. Patches occurring in plume waters traveled farther down-shelf (southward) than those in adjacent shelf waters. Winds modified this along-shelf transport. Specifically, upwelling-favorable (northward) winds mixed larvae offshore and out of the coastal plume. Downwelling-favorable (southward) winds drove patches of larvae across the continental shelf and toward the coast. Trajectories were simulated well by the mathematical model.

Washing of the contaminated samples was conducted by a three-step mixing procedure (salt water only, then with the addition of the dispersant solution to the salt water, and salt water) to simulate oil-saltwater-dispersant interactions.

As the wind blows, water recedes from the upwind shore and exposes terrain that was formerly underwater. Previous researchers have suggested wind setdown as a possible hydrodynamic explanation for Moses crossing the Red Sea, as described in Exodus 14.Methodology/Principal FindingsThis study analyzes the hydrodynamic mechanism proposed by earlier studies, focusing on the time needed to reach a steady-state solution. In addition, the authors investigate a site in the eastern Nile delta, where the ancient Pelusiac branch of the Nile once flowed into a coastal lagoon then known as the Lake of Tanis. We conduct a satellite and modeling survey to analyze this location, using geological evidence of the ancient bathymetry and a historical description of a strong wind event in 1882. A suite of model experiments are performed to demonstrate a new hydrodynamic mechanism that can cause an angular body of water to divide under wind stress, and to test the behavior of our study location and reconstructed topography.Conclusions/SignificanceUnder a uniform 28 m/s easterly wind forcing in the reconstructed model basin, the ocean model produces an area of exposed mud flats where the river mouth opens into the lake. This land bridge is 3-4 km long and 5 km wide, and it remains open for 4 hours.

Based on wide previous studies that included swath bathymetry, multi-channel and very high-resolution seismic reflection, gravimetry, magnetism and underwater photography surveys, nodules were collected at water depths ranging from 850 to 1000 m, associated with hydrocarbon-derived ankerite and dolomite chimneys and crusts. Thirty six selected samples among the various morphological types were used for the laboratory analysis of physical properties (morphology, colour, surface texture, sphericity, weight and size), mineralogy (XRD, optical and electronic microscopy) and geochemistry (XRF, AAS, ICP-MS, EPMA, GC-MS, S, C and 0 isotopes). Nodules show a wide range of sizes, densities, weights and morphologies. Nodules are formed of multiple millimetre-thick layers of Fe and Mn oxyhydroxides surrounding the nucleus composed of Early-Middle Miocene plastic marl. The textures developed by the Fe and Mn oxyhydroxides layers are massive, laminated, detrital and mottled to dendritic. Goethite, lepidocrocite, Mn-oxides (7 angstrom-manganates and 10 angstrom-manganates), quartz, and phyllosilicates are the main components. Accessory minerals are calcite, dolomite, siderite, rhodochrosite, kutnohorite, pyrite, chalcopyrite, potassium feldspar, zircon, rutile, ilmenite, and chlorite. Fe-Mn carbonates from the siderite-rhodochrosite continuous series are forming part of the mad nuclei. Framboidal, filamentous, and globular textures are observed in Fe-Mn oxides and pyrite suggesting biogenic origin. Nodules show a high mean abundance of Fe (38.6%) moderate Mn (6.0%). and low contents of trace metals and REEs compared to the average content of deep-seabed polymetallic nodules from other oceanic areas. The Mn/Fe ratio ranges from 0.07 to 0.25. The studied nodules hold in their oxide layers hydrocarbons (n-alkanes) derived from marine bacterial activity. Aromatic hydrocarbons in the form of phenanthrene, are also present which is characteristic of mature petroleum. The structure, mineralogy, and chemical composition in the studied nodules are similar to those of diagenetic-hydrogenetic continental margin nodules rather than deep-sea nodules.

As the third largest river in Hainan, the river plume plays an important role in the regional terrigenous mass transport, coastal circulation, and the coral reef's ecosystem. Studies have shown that wind forcings significantly influence river plume dynamics. In this study, wind effects on the dispersal of the river plume and freshwater transport were examined numerically using a calibrated, unstructured, finite volume numerical model (FVCOM). Both wind direction and magnitude were determined to influence plume dispersal. Northeasterly (downwelling-favorable) winds drove freshwater down-shelf while southeasterly (onshore) winds drove water up-shelf (in the sense of Kelvin wave propagation), and were confined near the coast. Southwesterly (upwelling-favorable) and north-westerly (offshore) winds transport more freshwater offshore. The transport flux is decomposed into an advection, a vertical shear, and an oscillatory component. The advection flux dominates the freshwater transport in the coastal area and the vertical shear flux is dominant in the offshore area. For the upwelling-favorable wind, the freshwater transport becomes more controlled by the advection transport with an increase in wind stress, due to enhanced vertical mixing. The relative importance of wind forcing and buoyancy force was investigated. It was found that, when the Wedderburn number is larger than one, the plume was dominated by wind forcing, although the importance of wind varies in different parts of the plume. The water column stratification decreased as a whole under the prevailing southwesterly wind, with the exception of the up-shelf and offshore areas.",,,,,,,,,14,1,0,0,6,0,15,,,2095-0195,2095-0209,,,,,,,,,,"Sun Yat Sen Univ, Sch Marine Sci, Guangzhou 510275, Guangdong, Peoples R ChinaSun Yat Sen Univ, Guangdong Prov Key Lab Marine Resources & Coastal, Guangzhou 510275, Guangdong, Peoples R ChinaColl William & Mary, Virginia Inst Marine Sci, Gloucester Point, VA 23062 USA",,,,2018-12-28,WOS:000425157200015,,

Among the most popular REE is Neodymium (Nd), being widely used in permanent magnets, lasers, and glass additives. Neodymium-iron-boron (NdFeB) magnets is the main application of Nd since they are used in electric motors, hard disk drives, speakers and generators for wind turbines. Recent studies have already evaluated the toxic potential of different REE, but no information is available on the effects of Nd towards marine bivalves. Thus, the present study evaluated the biochemical alterations caused by Nd in the mussel Mytilus galloprovincialis exposed to this element for 28 days. The results obtained clearly demonstrated that Nd was accumulated by mussels, leading to mussel's metabolic capacity increase and GLY expenditure, in an attempt to fuel up defense mechanisms. Antioxidant and biotransformation defenses were insufficient in the elimination of ROS excess, resulting from the presence of Nd and increased electron transport system activity, which caused cellular damages (measured by lipid peroxidation) and loss of redox balance (assessed by the ratio between reduced and oxidized glutathione). The results obtained clearly highlight the potential toxicity of REEs and, in particular of Nd, with impacts at cellular level, which may have consequences in mussel's survival, growth and reproduction, affecting mussel's population.

Sediment resuspension is associated with the wave and current induced shear stress in large, shallow lakes. The current study investigated the wind field impacts on sediment resuspension from the bottom at Meiliang Bay of large, shallow Lake Taihu. The impacts of the wind field on the wave, current, and wave-current combined shear stresses were calculated. The critical wind speed range was 4-6 m/s after which wave and current shear stress started to increase abruptly, and onshore wind directions were found to be mainly responsible for greater shear stress at the bottom of Lake Taihu. A second order polynomial fitting correlation was found between wave (R(2 )0.4756) and current (R-2 0.4466) shear stresses with wind speed. Wave shear stress accounted for 92.5% of the total shear stress at Meiliang Bay. The critical wave shear stress and critical total shear stress were 0.13 N/m(2) for sediment resuspension whereas the current shear stress was 0.019 N/m(2) after which suspended sediment concentrations (SSC) increased abruptly. A second order polynomial fitting correlation was found between wave (R-2 0.739), current (R-2 0.6264), and total shear stress (R-2 0.7394) with SSC concentrations at Meiliang Bay of Lake Taihu. The sediment resuspension rate was 120 to 738 g/m(2)/d during 4-6 m/s onshore winds while offshore winds contributed >= 200 g/m(2)/d. The study results reveal the driving mechanism for understanding the role of the wind field in sediment resuspension while considering wind speed and direction as control parameters to define wave and current shear stresses.

To better understand the complex interfacial transport mechanisms that this dispersant poses, we develop a model surfactant-oil-aqueous system of Tween 80 (a primary component in the Corexit dispersant used in the Gulf), squalane, and both simulated seawater as well as deionized water. We measure surfactant adsorption dynamics to the oil-aqueous interface for a range of surfactant concentrations. Using techniques developed in our laboratory, we investigate the impact of convection, step changes in bulk concentration, and interfacial mechanics. We observe dynamic interfacial behavior that is consistent with a reorganization of surfactant at the interface. We demonstrate irreversible adsorption behavior of Tween 80 near a critical interfacial tension value, as well as measure the dilatational elasticity of equilibrium and irreversibly adsorbed layers of surfactant on the oil-aqueous interface.

The intention of this paper is to find out the exact wave damping rate with the presence of mangroves, to figure out the results due to spatial distinction and the reasons of that. The measured sites named Lianhua Shan in Panyu and Leizhou Bay were chosen for their representative characteristics- there in the pass-by tropical storms usually stir up onshore and offshore wind. Wave gauges were mounted in line perpendicular to the coastline to record the time history of surface displacement synchronously during certain time periods. The data analysis indicates that both sites witness prominent wave damping, and coupled with bottom friction after 100 meters the measured maximum dissipation rate of wave height reaches 80%. Wave energy spectrum analysis is done as well to show the differences in energy dissipation under different water levels. Further insight into the wave damping rate manifests that spatial difference is significant particularly during the typhoon period due to its position relative to the storm route. What's more, examining the spectral wave energy dissipation pattern tells that water depth is a determinant factor to the spectrum shape and the dissipation capability of vegetation is distinct at different frequencies. Serving as natural coastal protection schemes, mangrove forests effectively mitigate the coastal hydrodynamics and reversely are greatly affected by hydrodynamics, contributing to an interactional stable aquatic ecosystem.

The course was 370 m long and had 19.4 m of vertical ascent and descent using the stairs on simulated offshore structures. Inspired ventilation and oxygen consumption were measured using the P. K. Morgan 'Oxylog' and subjects breathed through the apparatus by mouthpiece and one-way valve assembly while wearing a nose clip. On comparison with anthropometric data from larger studies, this sample of the offshore work-force was thought to be representative. The mean duration of the exercise period was 371 s (SD = 24 s, range = 325-424 s). Mean oxygen consumption standing still at the start of the trial was 0.421 min(-1) (SD = 0.101 min(-1), max. = 0.611 min(-1)) and mean ventilation 12.351 min(-1) (SD = 4.251 min(-1), max. = 22.271 min(-1)).

At the end of the exercise period, oxygen consumption returned to resting values after 2 min and ventilation after 3 min. There was no indication of an oxygen debt. Oxygen consumption and ventilation were related to body weight and the maximum figures for ventilation and oxygen consumption were seen in individuals of over the 95th centile for weight who completed the exercise more quickly than other subjects. Draft standards for respiratory protective equipment for use during escape from fire do not specify the breathing volumes identified in this study, and which are considerably higher than those being currently considered. Additionally, the atmospheric conditions near a fire are likely to stimulate ventilation to considerably higher levels than those identified here. Accordingly, such equipment is likely to limit physical performance if a similar intensity of exercise is necessary during an escape. The architecture of offshore installations and protocols for escape from them should be structured to minimize exercise, and stair climbing should be avoided if emergency respirators are to be used.

Therefore, multiple sources, mixed sources, and uneven distribution of sources occurred in the marine sedimentary basins in South China during the late stage of hydrocarbon pooling. Epidiagenesis of the marine carbonate reservoirs and its modification to reservoir poroperm characteristics determined the formation and the scale of natural gas pools. The exploration practices show that the large to medium gas fields mainly occur in areas with high-quality reservoirs. Detailed study of the paleo-oil accumulations and typical oil and gas reservoirs reveals that the basins experienced multiphase superimposition and modification, leading to the distribution of the Paleozoic paleo-oil accumulations and bitumen in the peripheral areas. The phenomenon that oil and gas production concentrates in the Sichuan basin indicates that the overall sealing conditions of a basin determine the oil/gas potentials and the scale of oil and gas production. This is a critical factor controlling the accumulation and distribution of gas in the marine sequences in South China. The early oil and gas pools in the Yangtze platform left billions of bitumen in the peripheral areas due to the destruction of seals. Since the Himalayan, late-generation and late-accumulation gas pools represented by the gas pools In the Sichuan (sic) basin were formed in the marine sedimentary sequences in South China as a result of the change of the sealing conditions. Current gas discoveries appear to be paleo-gencration and paleoaccumulation gas pools but actually are late-generation and late-accumulation gas pools. These patterns of hydrocarbon pooling clearly depict themselves in western Sichuan basin and Welyuan (sic) gas field. It is revealed that the gas pools in the Sichuan basin were mainly formed as a result of hydrocarbon phase change (thermal cracking of oil to gas), miscible migration, and dynamic equilibration since the Himalayan. A large number of gas pools were formed In the Himalayan and the gas pools in the marine sequences are characterized by late pooling; this kind of gas fields/pools are controlled by: (1) effectiveness of modification and superimposition of the marine basins, (2) effectiveness of the source rocks, (3) effectiveness of the overall preservation conditions, and (4) effectiveness of plays.",,,,,,,,,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,,,1002-0705,,,,,,,,,,,"SINOPEC, Explorat & Prod Res Inst, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China",,,,2008-12-01,WOS:000262588800007,,

After the Prestige petroleum tanker sank off northern Spain in 2002 and the Deepwater Horizon oil rig catastrophe in 2009, subjects involved in environmental decontamination showed signs of ongoing or residual lung disease up to 5 y after the exposure.OBJECTIVES: We aimed at investigating mechanisms driving persistent respiratory disease by developing an animal model of inhalational exposure to fuel oil-derived VOCs.METHODS: Female Wistar and Brown Norway (BN) rats and C57BL mice were exposed to VOCs produced from fuel oil mimicking the Prestige spill. Exposed animals inhaled the VOCs 2 h daily, 5 d per week, for 3 wk. Airway responsiveness to mcthacholine (MCh) was assessed, and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) and lung tissues were analyzed after the exposure and following a 2-wk washout.RESULTS: Consistent with data from human studies, both strains of rats that inhaled fuel oil-derived VOCs developed airway hyperresponsiveness that persisted after the washout period, in the absence of detectable inflammation in any lung compartment. Histopathology and quantitative morphology revealed the development of peripherally distributed pulmonary emphysema, which persisted after the washout period, associated with increased alveolar septal cell apoptosis, microvascular endothelial damage of the lung parenchyma, and inhibited expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF).DISCUSSION: In this rat model, fuel oil VOCs inhalation elicited alveolar septal cell apoptosis, likely due to DNA damage. In turn, the development of a peculiar pulmonary emphysema pattern altered lung mechanics and caused persistent noninflammatory airway hyperresponsiveness.

This process constitutes an important aspect of marine sediment transport and biogeochemical cycling. Sediment incorporation into sea ice is considered to occur mainly through underwater interaction between frazil ice and resuspended sediment, referred to as suspension freezing. However, harsh environmental conditions have greatly limited field observations of this phenomenon. Analysis of mooring data from a coastal polynya in the northeastern Chukchi Sea, in conjunction with coastal ice radar and meteorological data, indicates that suspension freezing is a key mechanism for sediment entrainment into sea ice. During polynya episodes, acoustic backscatter data obtained by an Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler showed the presence of frazil ice from the surface down to 20- to 25-m depth, coinciding with in situ and potential supercooling. Underwater frazil ice persisted over 1 week under windy, turbulent water column conditions. A combination of the turbidity and Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler backscatter data revealed upward sediment dispersion associated with strong currents during the polynya episodes. The fact that frazil ice and resuspended sediment were detected at the same depth and time strongly suggests the interaction between ice crystals and sediment particles, that is, suspension freezing.Plain Language Summary Sea ice incorporates, transports, and releases particulate matter. These processes constitute an important aspect of the biology, biogeochemical cycling, and pollutant transport in polar oceans. Seafloor sediments serve as the most important source of such particulate matter; however, the process of sediment incorporation into sea ice remains poorly explored. We conducted a year-long study of sediment resuspension and entrainment processes, using underwater sensors deployed in the Chukchi Sea. During winter, wind-driven offshore transport of sea ice created area of open water and newly grown thin ice that persisted for several days, so-called coastal polynya or flaw lead system. Our sensors recorded small ice crystals, so-called frazil ice, that formed in the water column when water temperatures were below freezing point (supercooling). During some of these episodes, sediment was resuspended from the seafloor and dispersed upward by the strong currents, bringing it into water depths at which frazil ice was encountered. Such conditions provide for opportunities that allow frazil ice crystals or aggregates to capture resuspended sediment, a process referred to as suspension freezing. Based on this study, we propose that suspension freezing commonly occurs in shallow Arctic polynyas, serving as a key process of sediment incorporation into sea ice.",,,,,,,,,19,0,0,0,7,0,19,,,2169-9275,2169-9291,,,,,,,,,,"Hokkaido Univ, Inst Low Temp Sci, Sapporo, Hokkaido, JapanHokkaido Univ, Arctic Res Ctr, Sapporo, Hokkaido, JapanHokkaido Univ, Global Inst Collaborat Res & Educ, Global Stn Arctic Res, Sapporo, Hokkaido, JapanUniv Alaska Fairbanks, Inst Geophys, Fairbanks, AK 99775 USAUniv Alaska Fairbanks, Int Arctic Res Ctr, Fairbanks, AK USA",,,,2019-12-16,WOS:000501068300001,,

Satellite derived Sea Surface Temperature was applied to study upwelling processes in relation to the driving trade winds. The investigations were focussed on the intensity and horizontal extent, the temporal and spatial variability including inter-annual and climate scales. Ocean colour satellite data allow investigation of the response of surface water to the nutrient input into the euphotic zone by upwelling processes. Observations in the area revealed, that the phytoplankton development starts with species absorbing light in the visible spectral range (diatoms and dinoflagellates) and may end in persistent shallow surface filaments with light scattering algae blooms. These blooms of coccolithophores identified by different in situ methods changed the water colour by strong particle scattering to milky turquoise discolorations. Further milky turquoise discolorations were identified as sulphur plumes. Low wind periods support the degradation of organic matter and the development of hydrogen sulphide in the bottom layer. After the onset of the trade winds and the offshore transport of surface water hydrogen sulphide enriched waters reaches with the near-bottom counter current the coast. Upwelling transports the water to the surface where the hydrogen sulphide will be oxidised to elemental sulphur. An algorithm was developed to identify and separate the sulphur plumes from algae blooms and other features on the basis of highly spectrally resolved satellite data from the MERIS sensor. The algorithm identified only coastal plumes as sulphur and that offshore plumes are formed by coccolithophores.

Residual flows across the inlet mouth were laterally sheared with inflow in the channel and outflow over the shoals. This pattern persisted during four separate semi-diurnal tidal cycle surveys effected over 3 years. During spring tides, residual exchange flows intensified relative to neap tides. Residual inflow in the channel only reversed immediately after tropical storms because of their extreme winds and major temporal changes in water level. After the residual flow reversed in the channel, along-channel baroclinicity drove gravitational circulation that persisted for 4.5 days and was enhanced by offshore winds. A depth-averaged along-basin momentum budget highlighted the importance of bottom friction to help balance the barotropic pressure gradient.

Both microfaunal and macrofaunal information were used to develop a biostratigraphic framework for the basin and a new tectonostratigraphic model. This new model for the development of the basin is significantly different to that used by the Oil and Natural Gas Commission of India.

The ice resistance to ship motion forms an essential problem in ship design and navigation. Furthermore, local or global ice loads acting on ocean systems are random and nonsmooth when impact interaction takes place. Impact loads on the bow of a ship navigating in solid ice may be modeled by a Poisson law. The measured stress amplitudes on the ship frame at the bow follow an exponential distribution. The nonhomogeneity and difference in ice microstructure, as well as the influence of salt and temperature, result in a great uncertainty in the ice strength. Therefore, the current review article aims at assessing the ice related problems encountered by offshore structures as well as by ships during their navigation. It also discusses the impacts of local and global ice loads on floating structures and reviews their existing probabilistic models. Moreover this article covers the dynamic interaction of ice with flexible and rigid structures, and ships. In view of ice loads on marine systems, new design regulations have been introduced by international organizations that are involved in the design and building of ships as well as offshore structures. The ship stochastic stability and the first-passage roll stabilization problem associated with random ocean waves will also be described in an attempt to stimulate future research work dealing with ice impact loads. Moreover due to the lack of research activities addressing the control problem of ships operating in icy waters, the current article will briefly discuss passive and active control schemes developed for controlling the ship roll motion.

To assess their fate and impact on the environment, it is essential to investigate coastal circulation regimes which may play an important role in the dispersion of contaminants across the bay and beyond. In this study, a high resolution coupled hydrodynamic - passive tracer model was combined with ADCP observations, to identify major circulation patterns and associated dissolved contaminant dispersion pathways in the contaminated semi-enclosed bay of Toulon (South of France, NW Mediterranean Sea). Two dominant circulation patterns and two derived ones could be identified, driven by winds (Mistral and easterly winds) and offshore water intrusions. Medium to strong Mistral events (> 6 m s(-1)) with a WNW direction cause a bi-layer pattern with surface waters flowing out of the bay and marine waters entering at depth. Less frequently, west Mistral winds of medium to strong strength (> 6 m s(-1)) may generate an anticyclonic circulation. During easterly wind conditions (> 6 m s(-1)), an inward flow can be observed which is sometimes reinforced by offshore water intrusions, probably from the local boundary current, the Northern Current (NC). Furthermore, dissolved contaminant dispersion pathways were simulated under typical wind forcing conditions with three point sources of copper (Cu) that were identified based on surface Cu observations. While most of the WNW Mistral wind events transport dissolved copper plumes across and out of the bay, contaminant dispersion can remain confined to the bay under certain west mistral conditions. Conversely, during easterly wind events, contaminants are exiting the bay as a narrow vein along the Saint-Mandrier peninsula, before probably converging on the NC offshore.

Since many analyses benefit from complete fields available over a regular grid, reanalysis products have been developed to fill this gap by constraining a numerical model with available observations. One of the most widely used ocean reanalysis products is the Simple Ocean Data Assimilation. Its current version (SODA3) does not have sufficient resolution to capture most of the eddies, especially in the high latitude regions. This may cause biases in regions where strong eddy activity or wind forcing and mixing are present. This project exploits the growth of computational power to make improved use of the limited historical observational record using a model that resolves the dominant smaller scales of motion in order to produce a mesoscale resolving global ocean/sea ice reanalysis called SODA4. The project also includes a focused examination of the role of mesoscale processes in the Arctic and in subpolar/Arctic exchanges. This work is directed toward understanding the role the ocean and sea ice systems play in regulating and modifying Earth’s weather and climate partly as a guide to improve forecasts of future changes. Improved understanding of historical ocean variability benefits the scientific enterprise by playing a crucial role as a guide to improve forecasts of coupled climate variability and by adding additional value to the historical observational record by reconstructing their basin-scale context. By supporting development and distribution of more realistic historical climate reanalysis spanning the past four decades this project can serve to integrate research activities across multiple areas and disciplines. The improved representation of smaller scales of motion and of regions of high human impact such as the nearshore environment should also help inform a broad community (coastal planners and engineers, wind farms, the fisheries community, etc.) regarding historical ocean variability and change. This research project also serves educational mission of University of Maryland College Park in several ways. Most directly it will support the dissertation research of a graduate student at the Department of Atmospheric and Oceanic Science. It will also involve a number of undergraduate research projects. Examination of SODA3 results shows that its resolution is insufficient where mesoscale variability and near-surface diapycnic processes play dominant roles. This project explores the additional improvements to representation of the state of the ocean/sea ice system that can be gained by more completely representing oceanic mesoscale processes even during decades when mesoscale-resolving observing systems were not available. One region which will benefit from enhanced resolution is the Arctic Ocean and its connection to the subpolar gyres. The subpolar North Atlantic is the major route by which water is exchanged with the Arctic Ocean and this connection is of particular interest for many reasons. First, the surface water of the Nordic Seas is warming rapidly and the winter ice is retreating. Second, strong decadal temperature variability is present with unknown consequences for the central Arctic. Third it is a key region of deepwater formation. This project thus includes a focused effort to improve representation and diagnosis of the dynamics of subpolar/Arctic exchanges and their connection to variable Arctic Ocean water masses.

A major part of the sand occurs in a 300 km long strip starting 200 km south of Lima between the towns of Pisco on the north and Chala on the south. The sand is picked LIP from the Pacific Ocean beaches by the nearly invariant south-southeast winds and moved inland to its resting place in huge sand masses (sand seas or ergs, depending on the author), generally at higher elevations. The writer mapped the moving sands and accumulated sand masses in this interesting region in 1959-1961 with airphotos, work which is partly unpublished and largely unknown (Plate 1). Eight sand masses were mapped; a ninth (Cerro Blanco) occurs just outside the area of airphoto coverage. If an average sand depth of only 10 m is assumed for the largest sand mass at lea in the northern Part of the area, that mass contains nearly 12 billion tons of sand and covers 900 km 2. Probably the average sand depth here is greater. One of the unique features of the present study was the mapping of the direction of sand movement (small arrows in Plate 1) which indicates the direction of prevailing Surface winds. Offshore, these winds have a nearly constant south-south east direction. Onshore, the winds blow in great clockwise-sweeping arcs due to frictional drag and other forces as the wind moves diagonally from the ocean over the uneven ground surface. However, there is some modification of the wind direction by topography, one good example being the obvious partitioning of the wind around both sides of Cerro Huaricangana (elev. 1725 m) in the center of the area (Plate 1b). But the most interesting wind pattern occurs in an area of subdued relief and low elevation near lea (elev. approx. 400 m), where the sands converge on the Ica sand mass from nearly opposite directions, that is, from the northwest, west, southwest, and southeast. The wide angle sweep (140degrees) of incoming sands here is believed to be unique in the world. A Landsat image was used to determine how this unusual wind pattern could develop (see Fig. 9), but the extreme local rotation of the winds is not fully understood. One idea proposed here by the author is that the surface/near-surface winds move as horizontal vortices, not in streamlines as is generally assumed, and it is the interaction of the vortices and the land surface that causes the pervasive clockwise swing in wind direction.

Nevertheless, feathers can be occasionally impregnated with oil from deliberate ship discharges and from massive oil spill accidents. The feather structure makes them effective traps for particles and are subject to external contamination. It is unknown to what extent the oil adhered to feathers can change trace element concentrations or stable isotope signatures. This study has two primary objectives: (1) to assess if there are differences between trace element concentrations and stable isotope signatures of oiled and clean feathers, and (2) to determine if the cleansing of oiled feathers using commonly applied techniques such as sodium hydroxide (NaOH) washes in combination with an organic solvent (hexane) is more effective than using NaOH alone. In order to do this, we analysed trace elements (Se, Hg, Pb, Cu and Zn) and stable isotopes (delta(13)C and delta(15)N) of individual feathers of yellow-legged gulls (Larus michahellis) which were affected by the 2002 Prestige oil spill in Galicia (NW Spain). Two sets of feathers were analysed, one group were oil-free (Control group) and the other had oil adhered to its surface (Oiled group). We expected to find differences between control and oiled feathers when cleaning exclusively with NaOH and no differences when using hexane. Our results did not show significant differences between Control and Oiled groups as a consequence of the cleansing method used. Unexpectedly, the additional cleansing with hexane resulted in decreasing selenium concentrations and increasing zinc and delta(15)N values in all groups of feathers.",,,,,,,,,12,0,0,0,11,0,12,,,0963-9292,,,,,,,,,,,"Univ Barcelona, Fac Biol, Dept Biol Anim, E-08028 Barcelona, SpainUniv Barcelona, Fac Med, Dept Salut Publ, Barcelona 08149, Spain",,,,2010-01-01,WOS:000273032100022,19731016,

We propose a quantitative structure-catagenesis relationship that predicts the hydrocarbon generation potential of source rocks and of lacustrine, marine, and terrestrial origin (types I, II, and humic coals). We used one-dimensional solid-state C-13 Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (C-13 NMR) spectroscopy with H-1 spectral editing to determine the abundance of carbon functional groups, including non-protonated and mobile groups. An NMR-based van Krevelen analysis readily separated the kerogen types. Single regression matrices of NMR-based structure parameters against Rock-Eval hydrocarbon yield revealed distinct dynamics of the kerogen types upon pyrolysis. Multiple regression showed that alkyl, oxygen-substituted alkyl, and carbonyl groups were strong contributors to hydrocarbon production, while oxygen-substituted aromatic carbons were strongly counterproductive. Catagenetic relationships established for kerogen provide insight into kerogen structure evolution upon pyrolysis, and can more closely constrain the mechanisms of hydrocarbon generation for use in sedimentary basin modeling.

It is a dispersive and extraordinarily attenuative natural material at frequencies which cause gas bubble resonance. It conceals the structure of the seabed from seismic profiling and it dampens acoustic signals that, for example, trigger acoustic mines. In the past, theoretical studies have formulated the probable cause of this response and crude experimental work has partially corroborated theory. This study measures compressional wave velocity and attenuation in a laboratory soil simulating natural gassy soil, and it investigates the structural properties that cause the unique acoustic response. It was confirmed that below the frequencies which cause resonance the soil behaves as a compressible material (containing gas), and above as a relatively incompressible material (containing no gas). Over the frequency range producing bubble resonance it is suggested that the soil should be modeled as a biphasic material of gas and a relatively incompressible saturated soil matrix (particles and fluid). Velocities for gassy soil were found to be as low as 220 m/s at frequencies below resonance and 1500 m/s above resonance; attenuations were found to be as high as 60 dB/cm for moderately gassy soil and as low as 1 dB/cm for soil with almost no gas.

These mass wasting events can trigger tsunamis and hence potentially devastate coastal communities and damage offshore infrastructure. However, the initiation and failure processes of submarine landslides are poorly understood. Here, we identify and locate 85 previously unknown submarine landslides in the Gulf of Mexico from 2008 to 2015. Ten of these landslides failed spontaneously while the remaining 75 were dynamically triggered by passing seismic surface waves from distant earthquakes with magnitudes as small as similar to 5. Our observations demonstrate ongoing submarine landslide activity in the Gulf of Mexico where dense energy industry infrastructure is present and that the region is prone to secondary seismic hazard despite the low local seismicity rate. Our results should facilitate future investigations to identify unstable offshore slopes, to illuminate dynamic processes of landslides, and perhaps to apply remote detection technology in tsunami warning systems.Plain Language Summary Landslides under the ocean are termed submarine landslides. Submarine landslides can pose hazards to coastal communities and offshore infrastructure, including triggering tsunamis and damaging oil platforms, pipelines, and submarine cables. These devastations may further cause environmental damages such as oil spills. Identifying these landslides and understanding their failure processes have both societal significance and intellectual merit. Using 8 years of continuous seismic data, we found 85 previously unknown submarine landslides in the Gulf of Mexico from 2008 to 2015. Ten of these landslides occurred without preceding earthquakes while the remaining 75 were triggered by the passing seismic surface waves from distant earthquakes.

The Sr/Ca record correlated with observed sea surface temperatures (SST), which allowed pulse inclusions of barium, copper and zinc to be dated and compared with various environmental records.Copper and zinc concentrations in this coral skeleton correlated with short exposures to labile metals in resuspended fine sediment. The biota-sediment accumulation factor (BSAF) indicated that concentrations of these metals in the coral skeleton were lower than the labile fraction in the sediment (BSAF=0.15 and 0.18, respectively). Distortions to the timing and amplitude of pulse-records in the coral record may have been caused by seasonal variation in skeleton growth.High barium concentrations in the coral skeleton recorded during a dry period corresponded with weather events that resuspended fine, inner-shelf sediment, specifically local winds interacting with swells driven by offshore trade winds, and dredging of the harbour's access channel. This coral has recorded entry of resuspended fine sediment into the reef.Irregularities in the strontium paleothermometer were similar to the solar radiation profile, which preceded variation of seawater temperature by about a month. When coral records were temporally adjusted to fit variation in solar radiation, the correlation between strontium and solar radiation was greater than the strontium-temperature correlation used to date the coral.

Lessons learned from recent open ocean oil disasters have exposed a need for commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) vehicles coupled with inexpensive COTS sensors that collect pertinent data sets that can be easily married across other systems, and easily calibrated and interpreted. A propeller-driven autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) equipped with a COTS sensor payload is being developed as part of a Department of Homeland Security (DIIS) program for under-ice oil detection and mapping. ALAN can greatly increase the efficiency of anomaly detection in an unknown ocean environment by finding the source of the plume and also by effectively mapping out its extent. Such systems could aid in determining the success of countermeasures deployed in a spill such as dispersants. Recent advancements in sensor technology, acoustic communications and vehicle duration make using propeller-driven AUVs a good choice for open water or under-ice detection of oil droplets and other environmental hazards. Near real-time data transfer is a key component in oil response scenarios in order for first responders to make critical decisions as fast as possible in order to limit damages. Using a REMUS-100 (Remote Environmental Monitoring Units) class AUV, we conducted an experiment using a COTS sensor payload to detect and map a subsurface release of fluorescein dye. Any release of oil would include compounds that would be water soluble, or partially soluble and also be fluorescent making fluorescein a reasonable dye to use as an oil surrogate. Our objectives in the experiment were to 1.) Launch and recover the vehicle with two to three people, 2.) Transmit data back to the boat so first responders can make decisions as fast as possible, 3.) Change the mission plan to re-task the search behavior to determine where the plume was and to 4.) Rapidly train United States Coast Guard (USCG) personnel how to program, launch, recover and operate the vehicle. The outcome of the demonstration fit the requirements for an easy-to-use COTS autonomous platform for oil detection needed within DNS. In addition to oil plume mapping, AUN chemical plume tracing capabilities can be used for other chronic and acute events such as unexploded ordinances, harmful algae blooms (NABS), oil and chemical releases from ship wreckages, sources of other hazardous pollutants. as well as creating baseline data sets for establishing the overall health of the ocean ecosystem to be used for damage assessments.Lessons learned from this open water experiment will help to develop a suite of adaptive mapping algorithms that will he transitioned onto a new generation long range vehicle currently being developed for deployment under ice in the Arctic.

There are 186 villages in Bulgaria in which there are no longer any inhabitants, which is a very serious economic and social problem. The depopulation of the countryside has led to massive financial losses in the absorption of the EU funds. That is why the state should intervene and devise policies for the development of villages. 2) There are possibilities for combating this problem in the application of alternative environmental energy sources - solar panels for electricity and for heating water using wind and thermo generators, biomass heating, etc. Bulgaria is one of the fastest growing markets for wind energy worldwide. There are already several wind farms in Dobrudzha and sea-experience that would be of particular interest to Latvia, where the wind is a convertible commodity all the year round. There are unique inventions patented by Bulgarian scientists, for example, the thermo-photovoltaic CHP of the researcher Georgi Tonchev. The European Wind Energy Association states that by 2020 Bulgaria will be ready to expand its energy production from wind up to 3,000 megawatts, covering more than 13 % of the total electricity consumption in the country. The European Union will provide grants to 58 municipalities for energy efficient projects. 3) The paper focuses also on energy policies and interests, the protests against shale gas production in 12 Bulgarian towns, on the passiveness of the institutions and the media, underestimating the chances of reviving the Bulgarian village and the opportunities to attract foreign investment and to reduce household bills. The methodology used in the paper is based on the case studies approach, content analysis of the Bulgarian media materials and the study of demographic statistics.

Although it was classified as only a Category 2 storm (Saffir-Simpson scale), Hurricane Isabel had a significant impact on the Chesapeake Bay with a 1.5-2.0 m storm surge (above mean sea level), and was dubbed the 100-year storm. A high-resolution unstructured grid model (UnTRIM) was applied to simulate storm tide in the Chesapeake Bay. The application of an unstructured grid in the Bay offers the greatest flexibilities in representing complex estuarine geometry near the coast and encompassing a large modeling domain necessary for storm surge simulation. The resulting mesh has a total of 239,541 surface elements. The model was forced by 9 tidal harmonic constituents at the open boundary and a wind field generated by a parametric wind model. A hindcast simulation of Hurricane Isabel captures both peak storm tide and surge evolution in various sites of the Bay. Model diagnostic studies indicate that the high surge occurring in the upper Bay regions was mainly caused by the forced southerly wind, whereas the offshore surge and both the northeasterly and southeasterly winds influenced the lower Bay region more significantly.

The aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of different dietary vegetable oils on seabream growers' health and liver structure. Two dietary vegetable oil blends (Mix 1 and Mix 2), namely sunflower oil, cottonseed oil and either linseed oil (LO) or soybean oil (BO), were tested as 60% FO substitutes versus the 100% FO control (CTR) diet. Three isonitrogenous (similar to 47% CP) and isolipidic (18.2% L) diets were fed, twice a day, 6 days a week to apparent satiation, to triplicate groups of seabream growers (mean IW, 130.85 g) in PVC tanks. The growth trial lasted for 20 weeks at an average ambient water temperature of 27.0 +/- 1.8 degrees C. At the end of the experiment, fish attained market size (300-400 g) and their health status was evaluated by blood analyses, head kidney prints and liver histology. Haemoglobin and haematocrit contents, erythrocyte (RBC) and leucocyte (WBC) count remained significantly unaffected by any dietary treatments. Despite the apparent relatively higher thrombocyte counts for fish fed vegetable oil diets, especially Mix 2 as compared with those of CTR fish, variations were found to be insignificant (P > 0.05). However, a slight deformation in erythrocyte shape was noticed in the blood films of fish fed the vegetable oil diets. Inclusion of either dietary vegetable oil blend had also elevated the number of both developing myelocytes and phagocytes in fish head kidney prints examined compared with those of CTR fish particularly for Mix 2 group. Liver from seabream fed vegetable oils showed slightly swelled hepatocytes due to accumulation of oil droplets in the cytoplasm. In the liver sections investigated ultra-structurally, nuclei and cytoplasmic organelles were shifted towards the cell periphery. Hepatocytes of fish fed Mix 2 diet showed relative shrinkage and picnotic nuclei, compared with those of CTR fish, suggesting an effect on lipid transport and/or metabolism in fish. The comparative hepatic features between experimental fish groups were described.

The hydrological regime is conditioned by the Volga discharge as well as by offshore and onshore winds. The current speed is 0.01-0.6 m/sec. In spring and summer the gaseous conditions become worse in the coastal areas of the islands, and favorable in the open parts. The biomass of algae in the pro-estuarine region increases between May and June from 644 to 5636 mg/m2. The zooplankton is dominated by Cyclops, cladocerans, rhizopods and amphipods; the benthos, by larval caddis flies, chironomids, mayflies, dragonflies and beetles. The emergence of insects occurs earlier in the pro-estuarine region than in the estuary, a circumstance which is explained by the higher water temperature of the former. Plankton distribution is extremely varied. Following the construction of the Volga and Volgograd hydroelectric power stations, the reproductive conditions of semi-migratory fishes deteriorated markedly in the estuary, and the main spawning grounds were displaced to the pro-estuarine region. Carp spawns in this region at a depth of 10-35 cm at a water temperature of 15,6-25[degree] C; the larvae are dispersed. Roach breeds in the estuary's lower reaches; it is less abundant in the pro-estuarine region; it spawns at 8-12-15[degree]. The bream's spawning season nearly coincides with that of carp, and its young are also dispersed. Some other fishes that spawn in the pro-estuarine region are gobies (Bubyr), rudd and white bream. Larvae of stickleback, of zander and perch have been observed. Sprat, shad, Volga shad and Bubyr spawn in the open part of the pro-estuarine region; adult fish and their young forage there. In all, 12 spp. of larvae, 95.6% of which were clupeoids, occurred in the coastal waters. The plant overgrowth in the island zone of the pro-estuary favors southern extension of the range, and leads at the same time to an increase in the abundance of low-value and coarse fish (rudd, white bream and sprat). The pro-estuarine region has become very important to the Caspian fishery, because it compensates to a significant degree for the loss of spawning grounds in the delta.

However, the marine structures are usually suffering environmental forces varying with time. Wave forces are the most important time dependent loading that causes fatigue in structural elements and joints. In this paper different methods base on S-N curve and linear elastic failure mechanics are presented. The governing equations and theories that are used in each method are expressed and the application of each method will be discussed.The two main methods of deterministic analyses are: stress-based approach (S-N curve approach) and linear elastic fracture mechanics (LEFM) approaches. These approaches are applicable to different analyzing strategies, ie the first approach is used for cases in which general form of fatigue is dominant, but the latter involves the calculations of reliability as functions of crack geometry and its boundary conditions.The SPD12C jacket platform in South Pars Oil Field is also modeled as a case study and the results of fatigue reliability analysis are presented.In this paper a comprehensive method is presented to accurately predict the reliability of offshore platforms. This method is based on S-N curve and the results are compared with the fatigue life of joints.Due to nonlinear interaction of soil and piles and the other affecting parameters such as flexibility of joints, non Gaussian procedure of loading, and nonlinearity of reaction force, the precise analyzing of stress levels will be impossible and a complex numerical analysis could only give limited information about the statistical properties of stress. In order to perform the fatigue analysis and predicting the cycles of stress SACS was used which is known as a powerful software in designing and analyzing offshore structures [1].In this paper the whole structure was modeled subjected to different forces such as wave and sea currents. The effects of parameters such as marine growth and interaction of soil and piles are also included.

It is usually triggered by rainstorms during grain filling. The study of natural lodging is difficult due to unpredictable weather. Proxy traits for lodging resistance such as stem morphology and breaking moment have limited validity because lodging is complex. We present a new mobile, low-cost field methodology called Blaster. It uses a wind turbine creating a 1 m wide and 6 m deep wind path in the field with wind speed adjustable to 30, 45 and 60km h(-1). Water injected into the air stream provides for wetting of the crop. A measurement cycle takes ca. 10 min per plot. The lodging response of 20, mostly high-yielding but diverse rice genotypes was studied in 2013, 2014 and 2015 under irrigated transplanted conditions in the Philippines. Genotypic responses were reproducible between seasons and were predictive of natural lodging observed in the wet season for a subset of 8 genotypes. Cultivars PARAO and CT 5805 from Latin America consistently stood out for superior lodging resistance. Across genotypes, morphological traits such as plant height, biomass or stem diameter were not or poorly predictive of lodging induced by Blaster. The best single proxy trait, stem-base bending moment at breakage (BM), explained about 40% of Blaster-induced lodging, and the Lodging Resistance Index composed of plant height, wet biomass and BM explained about 70%.

The aim of the paper is to analyse the principal mechanisms that are responsible for the noise reduction due to the application of the air-bubble curtain in marine piling. The results show that the noise reduction depends strongly on the frequency content of the radiated sound and on the characteristics of the bubbly medium. For piles of large diameter, which are typically used nowadays as foundation piles for offshore wind power generators, the noise reduction is mainly attributed to the reflection of the acoustic waves at the inner surface between the seawater and the bubbly layer.

Satellite data reveal that patterns in sea ice cover have been spatially heterogeneous, with significant declines in the Chukchi and Beaufort seas, yet more complex multi-year variability in the Bering Sea south of St. Lawrence Island. These patterns in the Chukchi and Beaufort seas have intensified since 2000, indicating a regime shift in sea ice cover across the northern portion of the PAR. In particular, satellite data over 1979-2012 reveal localized decreases in sea ice presence of up to -1.64 days/year (Canada Basin) and -1.24 days/year (Beaufort Sea), which accelerated to up to -6.57 days/year (Canada Basin) and -12.84 days/year (Beaufort Sea) over the 2000-2012 time period. In contrast, sea ice in the Bering Sea shows more complex multi-year variability with localized increases in sea ice presence of up to +8.41 days/year since 2000. The observed increases in sea ice cover since 2000 in the southern Bering Sea shelf region are observed in wintertime, whereas sea ice losses in the Canada Basin and Beaufort Sea have occurred during summer. We further compare sea ice variability across the region with the National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) North American Regional Reanalysis (NARR) wind and air temperature fields to determine the extent to which this recent variability is driven by thermal vs. wind-driven processes. Results suggest that for these localized areas that are experiencing the most rapid shifts in sea ice cover, those in the Beaufort Sea are primarily wind driven, those offshore in the Canada Basin are primarily thermally driven, and those in the Bering Sea are influenced by elements of both. Sea ice variability (and its drivers) across the PAR provides critical insight into the forcing effects of recent shifts in climate and its likely ultimate profound impacts on ecosystem productivity across all trophic levels.

Because gel and intervening embryos retard oxygen flux, such a life-history mode profoundly affects partial pressures of metabolic gases surrounding embryos. However, little is known about relationships between egg-mass structure and the opportunities and constraints imposed on structure by metabolic gas transport. We examined the effects of four factors (temperature, embryo age, embryo density and egg-mass size) on the metabolism of egg masses using both natural egg masses of a nudibranch and artificial egg masses made from sand dollar embryos and low-melting point agarose. Both temperature and embryo age strongly affected metabolic rates of nudibranch embryos. For embryos of a given age (stage), rates of oxygen consumption roughly doubled between 12 and 21 degrees C; from early cleavage to the veliger stage, consumption rose two- to fourfold, depending on temperature. Oxygen profiles in egg masses showed that advanced embryonic age, and to a lesser extent high temperature, both led to steeper oxygen gradients into egg masses. Egg masses containing advanced embryos at 21 C had very low central oxygen levels. Small-diameter artificial masses (2 mm diameter) had virtually no internal oxygen gradients regardless of embryo density or temperature, while medium (4 mm) and large diameter (10 mm) artificial masses had oxygen profiles that depended strongly and interactively on embryo density and temperature. Together, our data on natural and artificial egg masses suggest that (i) multiple factors have strong effects on metabolic rate; (ii) rates of oxygen transport are relatively invariant with temperature in simple, artificial systems but may vary more strongly with temperature in natural egg masses; and (iii) the four factors - temperature, embryo age, embryo density and egg-mass size - interact in important ways bearing on egg mass design.A simple mathematical model is developed to provide a quantitative means of estimating primary and interactive effects of the different factors. We also show that in T. diomedea the gel itself is the main barrier to oxygen transport into egg masses, and that the metabolic activity of embryos increases substantially when embryos are artificially released from the capsules that contain them within the gel mass.",,,,,,,,,46,0,1,0,46,0,57,,,0022-0949,1477-9145,,,,,,,,,,"Clemson Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Clemson, SC 29634 USAUniv Montana, Div Biol Sci, Missoula, MT 59812 USA",,,,2007-02-15,WOS:000244632700022,17267657,

The purpose of those designs mainly focuses on the reduction of fabrication difficulties and cost, while satisfying the requirement of exploitation at meantime. This paper presents a numerical study on the hydrodynamic behavior of a cell-truss spar platform. Features of truss spar and cell spar were both taken into account in the new spar concept, aiming to take advantage of the heave plate damping feature of the truss spar to obtain satisfactory heave motion performance, while reduce manufacture and installation difficulties with cell concept.

The spat of Perna canaliculus arrives intermittently at the beach attached to seaweed and other debris whereupon it is harvested for seeding mussel farms around the country. Periods of low or non-existent spat arrival at the beach have caused major disruption to the aquaculture production of this species. In an attempt to better understand the daily, monthly, and inter-annual patterns in the arrival of spat at Ninety Mile Beach, the harvesting records of spat harvesters for 1990 to 1999 were analyzed in relation to historical records of wind speed and direction, tidal range, water temperature, and modeled swell height and direction. For the long-term data set, spatfall events and the amount of spatfall increased markedly with strong offshore winds. On days with high tidal range, there tended to be an increase in the amount of spatfall, but this trend was not significant statistically. Daily and seasonal water temperature records did not show a significant effect on the timing or the scale of spatfall events. However, low swell height in the onshore direction was associated with a significant increase in spatfall events and amounts. Within the 9 year data set, storm events (wind speeds >20 m s(-1)) were most frequent during May to October. An average lag time of 4 months was found between peak storm events and the subsequent peak in spatfall events and amounts of spatfall occurring in September to October. Years with a greater number of storm events were also associated with significantly higher number of spatfall events and amounts of spatfall. Storminess and water temperature are associated with El Nino/La Nina episodes, which greatly influence the wind climate of New Zealand. During El Nino periods mussel farm managers could greatly reduce their risk of a shortfall in natural spat supply interrupting mussel production by securing sufficient spat to stock their farms from the large but less frequent spatfall events. Overall, the results provide valuable insight into possible ecological and oceanographic processes involved in spat arrival and will help with better utilization of the spat resource for this major mussel aquaculture industry.

Sea ice trajectory tracking with satellite scatterometer data in 2008 shows that ice around Antarctica is pushed offshore by katabatic winds influenced by the continental topography. The ice trajectories reveal that sea ice, grown earlier in the ice season, drifts northward away from the Antarctic continent forming a circumpolar frontal ice zone (FIZ) behind the ice edge. The FIZ thereby consists of sea ice that becomes rougher due to a longer exposure to wind and wave actions, and thicker over time by more ice growth and greater snow accumulation.In the Antarctic circumpolar sea ice zone adjacent to the sea ice edge, satellite data in 1999-2009 exhibit a band of strong radar backscatter, which is consistent with the signature of older, thicker, and rougher sea ice with more snow in the FIZ. This sea ice band, as wide as 1000 km, serves as a 'Great Shield,' encapsulating and protecting younger and thinner ice in the internal ice pack. In the young and thin ice region behind the FIZ, ice can grow rapidly as winds continue opening interior areas thereby creating effective ice factories. In addition, ridging can enhance ice thickness by convergence toward the circumpolar FIZ that is recirculated by westerly winds and currents. During the ice growth season, the FIZ advances until reaching lower-latitude warm waters at a boundary determined by the southern Antarctic Circumpolar Current front that is constrained by seafloor features. These persistent topographical and bathymetric geological factors help sustain the Antarctic sea ice cover. As such, the behavior of Antarctic sea ice is not a paradox as some have suggested, but instead is consistent with the geophysical characteristics in the southern polar region that starkly contrast to those in the Arctic.

A combination of oceanographic techniques, geochemical tracer studies, chemical and biological assessment methods, and dispersion modelling was used to describe the distribution and fate of petroleum hydrocarbons and added nutrients discharged from an offshore production platform. Using fine scale volatile hydrocarbon data, the horizontal and vertical diffusion parameters for a three dimensional dispersion model were calibrated under local conditions. Trace hydrocarbon chemistry studies and integration of the data into a mass balance model, facilitated a comprehensive description of dispersion and degradation pathways and rates, Bio-accumulation into bivalves and water column microbial growth inhibition studies confirmed the chemistry and model predictions that the area of potential biological impact extended to 0.5 nautical miles (similar to 900 m) from the discharge with additional skewing in the direction of the predominant tidal flows, Impact would be expected to be concentrated in transient surface slicks and near surface seawater, Dispersion and degradation processes were fast enough to prevent any long-term build-up of contamination within the system.

Hence, the electrification solution usually considered is based on expensive, though often unreliable, stand-alone systems, mainly small diesel-electric generators. Hybrid wind-diesel power systems are among the most interesting and environmental friendly technological alternatives for the electrification of remote consumers, presenting also increased reliability. More precisely, a hybrid wind-diesel installation, based on an appropriate combination of a small diesel-electric generator and a micro-wind converter, offsets the significant capital cost of the wind turbine and the high operational cost of the diesel-electric generator. In this context, the present study concentrates on a detailed energy production cost analysis in order to estimate the optimum configuration of a wind-diesel-battery stand-alone system used to guarantee the energy autonomy of a typical remote consumer. Accordingly, the influence of the governing parameters-such as wind potential, capital cost, oil price, battery price and first installation cost-on the corresponding electricity production cost is investigated using the developed model. Taking into account the results obtained, hybrid wind-diesel systems may be the most cost-effective electrification solution for numerous isolated consumers located in suitable (average wind speed higher than 6.0 m/s) wind potential regions.

Based on wide previous Studies that included swath bathymetry, multi-channel and very high-resolution seismic reflection, gravimetry, magnetism, heat flow probes and underwater photography surveys, nodules were collected at water depths ranging from 850 to 1000 m, associated with hydrocarbon-derived Mg-calcite, ankerite and dolomite chimneys and crusts. Forty-six selected samples among the various morphological types were used for the laboratory analysis of physical properties (morphology, color, surface texture, sphericity, weight and size), mineralogy (XRD, optical and electronic microscopy), geochemistry (XRF, AAS, ICP-MS, ICP-AES, EPMA, and GC-MS) and stable isotopes. The nodules show a wide range of sizes, densities, weights and morphologies. They are formed by multiple millimeter-thick layers of Fe and Mn oxyhydroxides surrounding the nucleus composed of Early-Middle Miocene plastic marl and sediment, which were derived from underlying units by fluid venting. Massive, laminated, detrital and mottled to dendritic textural features were developed by the Fe and Mn oxyhydroxide layers. The main components are Goethite, lepidocrocite, Mn oxides (7 angstrom manganates and 10 angstrom manganates), quartz, and phyllosilicates. Accessory minerals are calcite, dolomite, siderite, rhodochrosite, kumahorite, pyrite, chalcopyrite, potassium feldspar, zircon, rutile, ilmenite and chlorite. Fe-Mn carbonates from the siderite-rhodochrosite continuous series are the principal constituent of the nuclei. Framboidal, filamentous and globular textures are observed in Fe-Mn oxides and pyrite, suggesting biogenic origin. The nodules show a high mean abundance of Fe (38.6%), moderate Mn (6.0%) and low contents of trace metals and REEs compared to the average content of deep-seabed polymetallic nodules from other oceanic areas. The Mn/Fe ratio ranges from 0.07 to 0.25. The studied nodules hold hydrocarbons (n-alkanes) derived from marine bacterial activity in their oxide layers, with the presence of aromatic hydrocarbons as phenanthrene as well, characteristic of mature petroleum. The structure, mineralogy and chemical composition in the studied nodules are more similar to those of diagenetic-hydrogenetic continental margin nodules rather than deep-sea nodules. We Suggest that the formation of this type of nodule could respond to a combined diagenetic-hydrogenetic growth process, where the fluid venting from deep-seated hydrocarbon reservoirs, the bio-mineralization processes and the bottom currents erosion and chemistry could have played an important role.

Planning grants are not required as part of the full ERC competition, but intended to build capacity among teams to plan for convergent, center-scale engineering research. The Offshore Wind Energy (OWE) industry in Europe is booming, and has reduced electricity generation costs to less than $0.10 per kWh. The U.S. OWE resource is enormous, and could provide 10-20 times the national need for electricity. The U.S. is just starting to develop this resource, does not yet have an industrial supply chain for OWE, and there are unique U.S. challenges because of hurricanes, complex seabed conditions, and grid integration. In order to address these challenges, and to design resilient and cost-effective heavy OWE infrastructure (e.g., structures, transmission system), a convergent approach is needed. Failure for the U.S. to take this approach, to plan accordingly, to maximize continuous learning, and to take disruption actions when needed, would be a hugely missed opportunity for society to benefit from the breadth of U.S. expertise and knowhow, and to make technological advancements that have broad applications. This ERC planning grant project will bring together those with relevant expertise in OWE from several engineering disciplines, fields of science, the national laboratories, state and federal resource management agencies, industrial stakeholders, and developers; as well as those from affected coastal communities. This group will design a data-driven multi-disciplinary system-level framework that identifies where advances are needed to build a resilient infrastructure (blades, turbine, support structure, transmission grid, standards, and models) that would enable a large and responsible level of OWE to be harvested. The technical areas to be integrated together in this frame will include but are not limited to metocean characterization (wind, waves, currents), composite materials, aerodynamic modeling, geo-engineering parameters, stability, fatigue, corrosion, inspection, control, renewable energy integration, social acceptance of OWE development, and impact on marine and coastal ecosystems.

The UK is committed under the Kyoto Protocol to reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 12.5%, relative to 1990 levels, by 2010. The UK also has a domestic commitment to reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 20% by 2020 and by 60% by 2050. As part of a basket of other climate change-related policies and measures, the UK's Renewables Obligation aims to supply 10% of electricity from renewable sources by 2010, 15% by 2015 and to reach an aspirational target of 20% by 2020. This study has reviewed the potential impacts of renewable energy sources on UK biodiversity and assessed how biodiversity in the future may be affected by a growth in these types of technology. The renewable energy technologies considered are those where the energy source may be wholly derived from non-fossil fuel sources: Onshore wind, Biomass crops (including agricultural residues, forestry residues and energy crops), Small scale hydro (<5MW), Novel technologies (solar water heating (SWH), ground source heat pumps (GSHP), photovoltaic (PV) and hydrogen fuel cells), Offshore wind, Marine current, and Tidal energy sources. The review has been undertaken using a risk assessment methodology to produce a series of impact matrices, with the effects summarised by Broad Habitat type to provide a comparison across the different technologies. A brief review of the impacts of conventional technologies has also been provided to set the context against which the impacts of renewable technologies may be assessed. All the renewable energy technologies reviewed have some negative effect on the biodiversity of their locality. These effects may be slight and often temporary, such as disturbance of feeding patterns of fauna during construction operations, or they may be highly significant permanent and widespread impacts, such as loss of a habitat through flooding for small-scale hydroelectric schemes. Some technology types also have the capacity to enhance biodiversity and whilst such enhancements are generally slight and affected by the level of existing biodiversity, the changes can also be highly significant and they are usually permanent. Of the renewable energy sources examined, novel technologies appear to present least risk to UK biodiversity, at least in terms of their operation (risks associated with materials sourcing need to be considered). Within this technology type, it is photovoltaics that provide least direct impact upon biodiversity, provided that mining, manufacturing and recycling are subject to stringent environmental requirements. But their rate of future development, even in a best-case assessment, suggests that this technology is unlikely to provide more than 10% of the renewables target by 2020 (i.e. 2% of national energy demand). Solar water heating and ground source heat pumps (GHSP) may also have indirect biodiversity benefits by reducing electricity demand (both through the provision of heat and, for GSHP, cooling). However, biodiversity impact assessment needs also to consider the scale at which energy will be generated from each technology type, both in terms of the size of the power generation unit and the number in operation. The study considered scenarios for future levels of contribution from different renewable energy sources in order to assess possible biodiversity impacts of scaling up renewable energy output. The scenarios examined assumed major contributions from wind and biomass technologies to the 2020 target and examined cases where each of these energy sources was in turn further enhanced. The assessment of the size and scale required for renewable sources to meet the 2020 targets demonstrated that only a small area of UK land or seabed is required for each technology considered in the scenarios. Hence, it is anticipated that the future energy generation scenarios presented could be met with minimal impacts on biodiversity, if: (a) Renewable energy developments avoid sites of high biodiversity interest, (b) All the suggested mitigation measures for all energy sectors are implemented and effective, and (c) Multiple sources of biomass fuel are utilised. The issue of mitigation is critical and it highlights the need for research and post-construction monitoring at consented installations to test the effectiveness of mitigation measures. Such monitoring and assessment should be published to facilitate the spread of best practice. The land take required for sufficient production of biomass fuels in the UK means that it is unlikely to make up more than 5-20% of the 2020 target, without having a major impact on the area of agricultural land needed, unless large quantities of fuel are imported. But the issue of scale of planting for biomass production is also important in determining the nature and, to some extent, the direction (positive or negative) of its impact on biodiversity. The provision of smaller scale plantings of biomass has a stronger positive effect on biodiversity than large-scale plantings. Small-scale Combined Heat and Power (CHP) generation through biomass burning would also provide an indirect biodiversity benefit through improved energy efficiency, since heat demand in the UK currently uses around 50% of primary energy. However, the economic viability of CHP plants may depend on the extent to which the heat energy produced can be used directly. In cases where larger areas of biomass crop are required, guidelines aimed at ensuring biodiversity within the plantations may help offset the effect of plantation scale. Currently these are best developed for short rotation coppice (SRC) plantation design, with the specific aim of increasing the biodiversity value of the crop by including features such as rides, headlands and stands of different age-class to increase habitat heterogeneity. Further guidance is needed to maximise biodiversity benefits and minimise impacts for other crop types. The biodiversity impact of importing biomass fuel depends upon the type of fuel sourced, the country of origin and the measures in place within that country to reduce biodiversity impacts. The use of international supplies may result in considerable biodiversity impact outside of the UK, with no potential for mitigation measures to be enforced. At the very least biomass fuel should be sourced from countries where minimum acceptable standards of biodiversity protection are ensured, to avoid exporting negative effects of this technology. Assessment of the biodiversity impacts of biomass fuels in potential source countries would help to guide sourcing of such materials if it is necessary. Wind energy is likely to provide the largest proportion of the renewable energy target by 2020. But there remain some fundamental gaps in knowledge of the impacts on biodiversity and the effectiveness of some mitigation proposals, such as tailored turbine layouts to aid bird species' movements. Post-construction monitoring is mostly in its infancy, with rather little UK experience on which to draw, so far, and most of that experience relates to small installations and/or small turbine size. Monitoring programmes now in place are starting to deliver results that will make an essential contribution to the knowledge base relating to impacts of wind energy generation on biodiversity, notably birds. These need to be analysed and summarised into guidelines for developers to provide an indication of best practice for effective mitigation measures. In particular, a comparison needs to be made of the impacts of different turbine sizes on biodiversity. The biodiversity impact of individual house turbines (particularly if widely used in urban areas) has not yet been assessed. It has been suggested that the intermittency of wind power generation may be partially offset by importing electricity from Europe. However, this may only create biodiversity problems elsewhere. An assessment is needed of the biodiversity impacts of energy sources in other EU countries in order that such effects may be minimised internationally as well as in the UK. There is considerable uncertainty about the potential impacts of marine energy generation on biodiversity. There is little evidence about the effects of the type and scale of wave and tidal technologies that are most appropriate for the UK. The effects of developing technologies, in particular, are unclear since many are still at the early experimental stages. The current understanding of impacts or potential impacts arises largely from large-scale tidal barrages, but the likely nature and scale of impacts arising from the new marine technologies are thought to be different and/or of a lower order of magnitude. It is important that potential impacts on biodiversity, as indicated in the significance matrices, are researched from an early stage and that these studies continue into the scaling-up phases of development of these technologies. Further research. A number of areas have been identified from this assessment as requiring further research. Knowledge gaps are greatest within the marine environment for the relatively new wave and tidal technologies, particularly the developing technologies. The scale of energy production units and the number of units operating are both important aspects in determining biodiversity impacts, but there is insufficient understanding of their interaction for most renewable technologies. For onshore wind and biomass technologies, there is less known about the effects of widespread, small-scale developments than about the effects of large-scale production. Conversely for marine technologies there is a need to determine the impacts of scaling-up to large energy generation systems from the small-scale demonstration units. For novel technologies the impacts of widespread use of PV panels on the risk of bird collision needs further study. On-going monitoring and analysis are required to assess the effectiveness of existing and evolving UK and country-level policy, land use planning and legal mechanisms to mitigate renewable energy impacts on biodiversity, with particular reference to the need for rationalising, coordinating and improving controls in the marine environment. Publication of such assessments is important to highlight and encourage best practice.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2006-01-01,ZOOREC:ZOOR14503017815,,

In order to create this model, hundreds of tests were done on 72 real samples, which were welded with a wide range of real industrial parameters. The obtained results were processed and evaluated with different multivariate techniques, and we established the significance of all the chosen explanatory variables and the good predictive capability of the CTOD tests within the limits of the experimental variation.

Nonlinear mechanisms of dominant water fluxes between the sub-basins and the coastal sea are deciphered with respect to tidal and meteorological drivers. The orientation of residual pathways of annually-integrated water fluxes is consistent and similar for variable model scenarios, i.e. meteorological forcing, an imposed sea level rise or different bed friction coefficients, which permits the identification of dominant residual circulation cells in the system. It is further shown that the multi-basin system imports a substantial surplus of water from the western and eastern boundaries of the East Frisian Wadden Sea having an impact on the mass budget of the interconnected basins that has been underestimated so far in hydrological, sedimentological and ecosystem studies.

While integration of flexible materials (into the fins and/or body) holds the promise of improved swimming performance (in terms of both speed and maneuverability) for these robots, such components also introduce significant design challenges due to the complex material mechanics and hydrodynamic interactions. The problem is further exacerbated by the need for the robots to meet multiple objectives (e.g., both speed and energy efficiency). In this paper, we propose an evolutionary multiobjective optimization approach to the design and control of a robotic fish with a flexible caudal fin. Specifically, we use the NSGA-II algorithm to investigate morphological and control parameter values that optimize swimming speed and power usage. Several evolved fin designs are validated experimentally with a small robotic fish, where fins of different stiffness values and sizes are printed with a multi-material 3D printer.

This study explored the biodegradation of petroleum pollution by indigenous N-2 fixing marine microbial consortia. Particulate organic carbon (POC) in the form of ground, sterile corn-slash (post-harvest leaves and stems) was added to diesel fuel amended coastal water samples to stimulate biodegradation of petroleum hydrocarbons by native microorganisms capable of supplying a portion of their own N. It was hypothesized that addition of POC to petroleum amended water samples from N-limited coastal waters would promote the growth of N-2 fixing consortia and enhance biodegradation of petroleum. Manipulative experiments were conducted using samples from coastal waters (marinas and less polluted control site) to determine the effects of POC amendment on biodegradation of petroleum pollution by native microbial consortia. Structure and function of the microbial consortia were determined by measurement of N-2 fixation (acetylene reduction), hydrocarbon biodegradation (C-14 hexadecane mineralization), bacterial biomass (AODC), number of hydrocarbon degrading bacteria (MPN), and bacterial productivity (H-3-thymidine incorporation). Throughout this study there was a consistent enhancement of petroleum hydrocarbon degradation in response to the addition of POC. Stimulation of diesel fuel biodegradation following the addition of POC was likely attributable to increases in bacterial N-2 fixation, diesel fuel bioavailability, bacterial biomass, and metabolic activity. Toxicity of the bulk phase water did not appear to be a factor affecting biodegradation of diesel fuel following POC addition.

We present results of interannual changes in seafloor surficial geology at the Redbird artificial reef site, located on the continental shelf offshore of Delaware Bay. The Redbird reef is composed of NYC subway cars, barges, tugboats, and other sunken objects. Since objects were added sporadically between 1996 and 2009, the survey area acts as a natural laboratory to study the evolution of the surrounding seafloor at a structural reef habitat through time. Annual side-scan surveys from 2008 through 2011, and one bathymetric survey in 2010 provide information about surface geology and morphology. Local wave and current data for this time period were analyzed to determine the main morphological agents. Automated backscatter segmentation show that three bottom types dominate and that these large-scale ( > 10 m) surface sediment patterns persist from year to year. Grab samples reveal that the bottom types are silty sand with clay and sandy gravel. Clear sediment and biological patterns emerged revealing the influence of the objects on the seafloor. Comet-shaped moats of sandy gravel surround single objects and grow to form large-scale coalesced patches around groups of objects. Alignment of sediment patches suggests the periodic hydrodynamic influence of seasonal storms. The abundance and diversity of organisms increases with decreasing clay/silt content. Evidence of scour includes the removal of fine sediments, the formation of moats 1-30 m in diameter and 0.5-1 m deep around the reef objects, and the > 1 m settling of objects into the seafloor. Data suggest subway cars reached equilibrium with the environment in 6-7 years, but that larger objects or clusters of objects take a longer time to equilibrate and have farther-reaching effects. Knowledge of local wave and current climate and stratigraphy could inform decisions of object clustering and orientation to decrease scour impacts. (c) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

J,,,,,,,,,Jun Liang,,Mitigating the effect of low inertia and low short-circuit level in HVDC-rich AC grids,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Awarded Grant,Dec 15 2014,2014,"Renewable power, particularly offshore wind power, will be a major element of the UK's transition to meet its energy demands while reducing carbon emissions. HVDC will be the key technology for integrating offshore wind power into the UK AC grid and for interconnecting other AC grids in Europe. Line commutated converter (LCC) HVDC is particularly suitable for bulk power transfer while voltage source converter (VSC) HVDC is particularly suitable for connecting offshore power into AC grids with low inertia and low short-circuit level. Multi-terminal HVDC networks and DC grids based on VSC technology will be developed across the North Sea to form a future SuperGrid to increase the flexibility, redundancy and economic viability of offshore wind power transmission.Conventional synchronous generators will be replaced increasingly by renewable generation with power electronic converters and HVDC transmission. This causes significant reduction of system inertia and short-circuit level. Particularly in the UK, large scale offshore wind power and interconnection with grids in other European countries will lead to an HVDC-rich AC grid. This will result in AC grids with low fault-circuit and low inertia which will present a series of challenges for AC system operation such as the potential impact on existing relaying protection; frequency instability and commutation failure of LCC HVDC.This proposed project will look at the behaviour of low-inertia and low short-circuit level in HVDC-rich AC grids supplied through power electronic converters. The challenges will be that the capability of HVDC links to provide the system support could be (at the same time) adversely affected by these effects on the grids. LCC HVDC can provide artificial inertia but requires high short-circuit ratio of the grid to work properly. During AC fault and post-fault restoration, the inertia support capability of the LCC would be limited at the very time it is most needed. VSC HVDC control is less dependent to AC grids. However a DC fault can be easily propagated across whole HVDC grid due to the very low resistance of DC lines, which in turn affects the AC sides of all terminals. During the DC fault, the real power injected into AC grids as well as the inertia support from VSC HVDC grids would be lost at the very moment it is much needed to maintain the system frequency. At the same time, reactive power support to AC grids from VSC HVDC grids would also be lost completely or partially depending on converter topologies. Investigations will be undertaken of the inertia support from HVDC converters, on the capabilities of the different types of converters to mitigate low-inertia effects and on their coordination through the AC side (for point-to-point HVDC links) or through the DC side (for converters within the same DC grid).The hardware-in-loop (HIL) platform at Cardiff University, which consists of a HVDC grid test rig, a real time digital simulator (RTDS) and a power amplifier, will play a key role in the modelling and testing of HVDC-rich grids and HVDC converter control for mitigating low-inertia and low short-circuit level effects.Through this project, in-depth understanding of operation characteristics of AC grids which are rich in HVDC links will be achieved. Solutions will be founded to enhance the system inertia and short-circuit level. More renewable power through HVDC can be integrated into AC grids without deteriorate the system performance. The research outputs of this project will be disseminated through industrial partners, international academic associations, conferences and journal publications.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,EP/L021455/1,,,,,,,,Cardiff University,,,,2023-12-08,GRANTS:15402230,,

Several studies have recently used ecological risk assessment approaches to identify risk factors of greatest concern, but rarely are the underlying methodological decisions discussed in terms of the effect that those decisions have on the outcome of the assessment and ultimately, how that affects prioritisation of risk factors for management.This study therefore evaluates the effect of methodological decisions involving (1) the choice and definition of risk factors, and (2) the calculation of risk scores, providing, where possible, recommendations on what should be the most appropriate methodologies.The definition of risk factors is often determined by the policy context and could result in the comparison of one broadly defined risk meta-factor (e.g. Food Production) with corresponding specific risk factors defined more narrowly (i.e. Oil and Gas production or Offshore Wind). Depending on the method to calculate risk this may result in a systematic bias prioritising any risk meta-factor. For the calculation of individual impact chain risk scores we compared weighted scores with ordinal scores, where the former allows more flexibility to represent the qualitative categories that determine risk and provided results better supported by scientific evidence. A consideration of different risk assessment applications in EBM showed there is no one-size-fits-all solution to this as these methodological decisions need to be considered in concert and the preferred methodology may depend on the context in which the risk assessment is applied.
